Mr. President, I would like to continue our dialog that \nwe, the freshmen, have had seeking to talk about the agenda, to talk \nabout the opportunities that we have for the first time in 40 years to \nhave a real opportunity to take a look at the programs that have been \nin place, programs that have simply been added to over a period of \ntime, programs, obviously that had merit in the beginning, have some \nmerit yet. But we have an opportunity to look at them, to look at ways \nto make them more effective and more efficient.\n  We have an opportunity to respond to voters who, I think, in November \nsaid we want change, we need to make a change in Government. I think \none of the measures of good Government is whether or not Government is \nresponsive to the kinds of messages that we receive from voters.\n  We want to take an opportunity to make Government programs work \nbetter. I think, unfortunately, there sometimes is a perception when \nyou talk about change that those who want change simply want to toss \nout the programs and do nothing. That is not the case. The case is how \ndo we do a better job of providing services to people? How do we be \nmore effective?\n  Welfare is an excellent example. No one is talking about throwing \nwomen and children and welfare fathers out on the street. What we are \ntalking about is helping people to help themselves, find a way to be \nmore efficient and to put people back into the workplace. That is what \nwe are talking about.\n  So we are talking about bringing the Government closer to the \npeople--block grants to the States, moving more responsibilities to the \nStates--so people can participate more in their Government.\n  I do not think there is any question but what the voters in November \nsaid we want less Government and it should be less costly, that \nGovernment is too big and Government is too expensive.\n  So, Mr. President, that is the kind of agenda that the 11 of us who \nare new to this body would like to pursue. Those are the kinds of \nthings that we believe \n[[Page S6020]] should be considered and should be changed.\n  All of us have had a 2-week recess. I was in Wyoming for that entire \n2 weeks and, I must tell you, I come back reinforced and rededicated to \nthe idea that we need change. I heard from nearly everyone there: ``We \nare pleased with what has begun in Washington. We are pleased with the \nideas.'' Certainly not everybody agrees with every detail. But the fact \nis that at least in my experience, people want us to move forward.\n  To do that we are going to have to continue to make clear, I think, \nthe perception of what we are seeking to do. And the opposition, those \nwho are opposed to change, and obviously the direction and the agenda \nof the administration is to say to people who are asking for change, \nall they want to do is do away with programs. Their notion is going to \nbe to create fear--fear of change--and we are going to have to do \nsomething about that.\n  I think there are great debates, there are differences in view, \nclearly, of how people see the world, and there is a great deal of \ndifference right here in this body among the Members. Some believe, \ngenuinely and legitimately, that more Government is better, that we \nought to have more money to spend, that the Government does a better \njob of spending money than do the taxpayers. On the other hand, most of \nus do not agree with that notion and want to make it smaller.\n  There is a legitimate debate and there is a great debate. So we have \nan agenda, and in order to do that, Mr. President, we are going to have \nto move through that agenda. I respect the purpose of the Senate in \nterms of its ability to go into depth and it is a deliberative body, \nand that should be the case. But it should not be an obstructionist \nbody. It should not be a body that simply ties up this great debate, \nbut rather it ought to be out there and we ought to have an agenda and \nwe ought to move forward.\n  There are a number of things, certainly, that we clearly ought to \ntalk about. We are talking about one of them now, and that is tort \nreform, something that needs to be done. We need also to talk about \nwelfare reform. That is a legitimate thing we ought to do. We ought to \ntake another look at crime. Clearly, health care needs some revision. \nWe need to have regulatory reform. We need to balance the budget.\n  These are the agenda items that we have a responsibility, Mr. \nPresident, to undertake. I think if those of us who were elected this \nyear have any message, the message is let us move forward with these \nissues, let us talk about these issues. We are willing to accept the \nresults, of course. But we are not willing to accept the idea that we \ndo not have an agenda, that we are not going to deal with the questions \nthat the American people have asked, that we are simply going to take \nup all our time in obstructionist kinds of activities, that the rapid \nresponse team is always going to be opposed to change. So that is where \nwe are, Mr. President.\n I think we have the greatest opportunity, and I thought that last \nmonth. And I have to tell you, having spent 2 weeks in Wyoming, that \nnotion, in my view, is simply reinforced that people do want us to go \nforward.\n\n  Mr. President, I am not sure of the agenda. But the freshmen had a \ncertain amount of time.\n  I yield to my associate from Pennsylvania.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

I thank the Senator for yielding. I would like to \naddress a specific issue in the next 100 days in the Senate that I \nthink is going to attract a lot of attention. It has already attracted \na lot of attention. It is an issue of great importance to this country \nand people rely on this program--that is the Medicare Program. There is \na lot of discussion going on in this town--and I hope across America--\nabout Medicare and where it fits in with the scheme of things here in \nWashington.\n  Is Medicare going to be used to balance the budget? Is Medicare a \nprogram that is in trouble? What is the truth? What is the real story \nand who do you believe? Unfortunately, in Washington, that is a problem \nwe have a lot, which is that every issue, irrespective of the \nimportance of the issue, turns into a partisan battle, and one side \nsays one thing and the other side says another. You would think with an \nissue such as Medicare, with the information we have before us, that we \ncould act as adults and face the problem squarely, maturely, discuss \nit, debate it, and come up with a solution to the problem.\n  But as is the case around here all too often, political gain comes \nbefore responsible action. We have folks who think we can make \npolitical gains from Medicare, so let us delay responsible action for a \nwhile and see how much hey we can make in the process.\n  Here are the facts. The facts are that the Medicare trustees issued a \nreport that says that Medicare will be insolvent by the year 2002. In \nother words, it will not have any money left in the trust fund to pay \nout benefits to anyone. That is not 25 years or 30 years from now, \nwhich is the problem of Social Security. Americans seem to be tuned \ninto that Social Security is in trouble in the long term and that we \ncannot sustain it. The insolvency of Social Security is a little over \n30 years away. It is a problem and we have to deal with that. We have a \nlittle bit more time.\n  Medicare is an immediate problem. Medicare runs out of money in 7 \nyears. You would think, as I said, as mature adults elected here to \ngovern the country, we could sit down and accept that, accept the \nfindings of the trustees. Four out of the six Medicare trustees are \nClinton administration officials. They have issued this report that \nsays, ``The Medicare trust fund will be able to pay benefits for only 7 \nyears and is severely out of financial balance in the long-range.''\n  That is what this chart shows. Here is where the Medicare trust fund \nis exhausted, 2002. Here is the gap. It grows and grows. This is the \nrevenue shortfall. It only gets worse, particularly in the outyears \nwhen the baby boomers start to retire.\n  There are less people working to support the Medicare trust fund. It \nis obvious that we have to do something; it is obvious that the time to \nact is now while we have a meager surplus that is going to be \nexhausted, as I said before, in 7 years. You would think that we could \ncome to the table, accept the Clinton administration's own findings \nthat this is a problem that must be solved, accept their own \nrecommendation--again, the recommendation of the trustees--that says we \nneed urgent action. But, no, you are going to see the big dance that \ngoes on around here, the big dance on how we are going to scare \nseniors, lie to them; and anybody who wants to touch Medicare is not \ngoing to try to save Medicare. Oh, no, they just want to take the \nprogram away from them. They want to ruin Medicare. They want to break \ntheir promises to the American public.\n  Why? Why would people say things that are blatantly false? Why would \nthey say that? Well, it is certainly not to preserve the trust fund, \ncertainly not to make sure Medicare is there for future generations--I \nshould not even say future--this generation of seniors. That certainly \nis not the reason they are saying it. Why are they saying it? Very \nsimple: Political gain.\n  Political gain. It is a tried and true American maxim in American \npolitics, and that is if you can square seniors enough so that they \nwill vote against the other side who wants to take their programs away, \nyou can win elections and then after the election, you will discover \nthe problem. After the election is over, after you have reaped the \nbenefits by scaring seniors that these bad guys out here who want to \ntouch Medicare are out really to kill the program, after you have \naccomplished the scare tactics and succeeded in victory, then come to \nthe floor, come to the American people after the election, after you \nhave won and lied, and after you have accomplished what you wanted, and \nthen say, look, the Medicare trust fund is going to be out of money, we \nhave to do something. That is what is going to happen. That is what \nhappened on Social Security in 1982. It is going to try to happen in \n1996.\n  I just hope--I really hope--that the American public is smart enough \nto see through these scare tactics, not only by the Clinton \nadministration, by the Democrats here in Congress, by these \n[[Page S6021]] shameless, shameless seniors organizations who pray on \nthe fear of seniors to swell their membership and get contributions and \nbe able to fund their lobbyists and TV commercials and continue to go \nout there and feed on this frenzy. I hope the American public and \nseniors can see through this. It is a scare tactic that should not \nsucceed. See through this. See that there is a problem, and see that \nthose who want to tackle the problem now are doing it because we care, \nnot because we want to destroy a program.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I would like to add my very strong voice \nto that of my colleague from South Dakota, who will be speaking on \nthis; the Senator from Montana, Senator Baucus; as well as Senator \nDaschle, on the potential sale of the Power Marketing Administrations \nthat the administration has proposed.\n  There are a lot of things wrong with the Federal Government, very \nfrankly, and I know we should always be looking for the functions we \ncan privatize, that are done better in the private sector than by the \nFederal Government.\n  The American system of the Power Marketing Administrations is, in my \nexperience and that of many of my constituents, an example of something \nthat the Government does well in direct partnership with those folks \nliving in rural regions of America.\n  The electrification of rural America is a success story because it \ninvolved a true partnership between the Federal Government and the \npeople of rural America who rely on the electrification of the REA's to \nprovide their power.\n  The partnership with the Federal Government has been a mutually \nbeneficial one. America's rural electric cooperatives and small \nmunicipal power systems agreed to purchase the initially more expensive \nFederal hydropower because they understood the long-term security of a \npublicly owned power system.\n  Without the commitment to purchase the power, the system could not \nhave been built. The REA members and other customers pay for \nelectricity based on the cost of providing service, retirement of the \nconstruction debt, and interest.\n  The system is working well, Mr. President. Those who rely on \nelectrical power from the system are repaying the Federal Government \nfor capital investment costs of building a system, as well as the \nannual operation and maintenance costs of the system.\n  Down the road, when the projects are paid for, these dams and \nfacilities will be federally owned and will continue to provide \nsignificant sources of revenue to the Federal Government.\n  The proposal of selling off the PMA's has a great deal of \nuncertainty. It is clearly our goal to cut the deficit, but on the \nother hand, if we are simply doing things to privatize another \nGovernment function without understanding the effects of doing so, I \nthink it is rather risky.\n  Is it change just for the sake of change? I hope not. If it is to \nmaximize deficit reduction, that means we sell to the highest bidder. \nIf we do that, clearly the highest bidder will have to raise the \nelectric rates for rural America, and that will not do any good for \nthose who represent the States.\n  The rural regions that are having the toughest economic times of \nanywhere must have low rural electric rates. As Congress considers a \nnew farm bill and the probability that many vulnerable programs may be \ncut or eliminated, I think it would be cruel to also turn out the \nlights.\n  If, on the other hand, those who represent rural regions insist, and \nwe will, that there be a safe prohibition placed on the rate increases \nif they are sold, then it seems to me we are truly in a pointless \nexercise, privatizing a function that most agree serves its customers \nwell at no annual cost to the Treasury.\n  I want to thank my colleagues, Senator Pressler, Senator Daschle, and \nSenator Baucus, for arranging a section on which they will also speak.\n  I yield the floor.\n  \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/05/03/senate-section/article/S6021-1", "month": "05", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "03", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6021-S6025]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                              PUBLIC POWER\n\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Mr. President, I rise today to express my opposition to \nthe administration's proposal to sell the Western Area, Southwestern, \nand Southeastern Power Marketing Administrations--collectively known as \nthe PMA's.\n  Public power serves many functions in South Dakota. As a sparsely \npopulated State, utilities are faced with the challenge of how to get \naffordable electricity into small cities and communities where there \nare less than two people per mile of transmission line. Public power \nprovides the solution.\n  In public power utilities, the only investors are the consumers. \nRevenues are reinvested in the community--in the form of taxes and \nservices. And, the low cost of power is essential to encourage economic \ndevelopment in small cities and towns.\n  Public power, purchased through the Western Area Power \nAdministration, known as WAPA, costs South Dakotans an average of 2.5 \ncents less than the market rate. This allows revenue to be reinvested \nin additional transmission lines, and better service. The availability \nof hydropower from the Missouri River to rural cooperatives and \nmunicipals have helped to stabilize rates. With 7,758 miles of \ntransmission lines in the Pick-Sloan region, WAPA can serve 133,100 \nSouth Dakotans--without charging them an arm and a leg.\n  Public power has brought more than electricity to South Dakota. For \nexample, Missouri Basin Municipal Power Agency, based in Sioux Falls, \nhas embarked on a program offering incentives for planting trees. The \ngoal is to plant at least one tree for each 112,500 meters in the \nAgency's membership territory. In fact, Missouri Basin was recognized \nby the Department of Energy for outstanding participation in this \nGlobal Climate Change Program. I congratulate Tom Heller of Missouri \nBasin for this excellent community service program.\n  Public power also brings new jobs to the communities it serves. In \npart due to the low cost of power from East River Electric, there are \nnow three injection molding plants based in Madison, SD--creating \nsnowmobile parts. Arctic Cat, PPD, and Falcon Plastics employ \napproximately 200 people in Madison.\n  East River also is involved in other economic development activities. \nIt provides classes to help the community attract businesses, and \noffers grants for feasibility studies associated with economic \ndevelopment projects. South Dakota clearly has benefited from the work \nof Jeff Nelson, as the general manager of the East River Electric Power \nCooperative.\n  Public power is a South Dakota success story. It is the source of \ninnovation, development, and community pride. I am sure the same is \ntrue in other towns and communities across America. In spite of\n these success stories, the Clinton administration--and several Members \nof Congress--want to put an end to this success.\n\n  Specifically, President Clinton has proposed selling WAPA and two \nother power marketing administrations in order to pay for the modest \ntax cut he has promised the American people.\n  In essence, this would force South Dakotans--and public power \nconsumers in small cities and rural areas--to cover for the rest of \nAmerica.\n  Under the President's plan, South Dakotans would not be able to enjoy \nthe promised tax cut. Why? Because the sale of the PMA's could result \nin rate increases totaling more than $47 million.\n  In addition, I question the claim made by the administration that the \n\n[[Page S6022]] sale of the PMA's would generate revenue for the Federal \nGovernment. Will it? Let us look at the facts.\n  PMA's still owe $15 billion in principal. Also, more than $9 billion \nin interest already has been paid to the Federal Government. By selling \nthe PMA's, the Government would forfeit future interest payments.\n  In fact, a recent report prepared by the Congressional Research \nService demonstrates just how much money the PMA's are expected to \ncontribute to the Federal Government. This year, WAPA is expected to \npay back $225.1 million borrowed from the Federal Government. But WAPA \nwill also return another $153.4 million to the Treasury. Given these \nfigures, it is clear that the Clinton plan does not make good economic \nsense.\n  As my colleagues know, this is not a new issue. I have been fighting \nthe proposed sale of the PMA's ever since I came to Congress. In 1986, \nthe Reagan administration made similar attempts to privatize the PMA's. \nWe stopped them by passing a law to prevent the Department of Energy \nfrom pursuing any future plans to sell the PMA's, unless specifically \nauthorized by Congress. I suspect the Clinton administration may have \nforgotten that law.\n  Mr. President, once again, we are fighting to prove the worth of \npublic power. Once again, we must demonstrate how necessary it is to \nthe lives of rural Americans. The people of South Dakota have stated \ntheir message loudly and clearly--through thousands of postcards, \nletters, and phone calls. South Dakotans such as Ron Holstein, Bob \nMartin, and Jeff Nelson have been leaders in their opposition to the \nproposed PMA sale and I appreciate all their hard work.\n  Public power is a solid investment for the Nation. Public power is \none of the great success stories of South Dakota. I urge all my \ncolleagues to stand united behind the continued success of public \npower, and the essential service it provides to the Americans who \nreside in small cities and towns. Now is not the time to mess with \nsuccess.\n                    power marketing administrations\n\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, I rise today to join my colleagues in \nexpressing opposition to the privatization of the Federal Power \nMarketing Administrations [PMA's]. This ill-conceived concept, which \nproponents claim would help reduce the deficit, is simply a bookkeeping \ngimmick that would accomplish little except for raising the electric \nrates of millions of consumers served by municipal and cooperative \nutilities.\n  A number of years ago customers of municipal and cooperative electric \nutilities entered into a covenant with the Federal Government. In \nexchange for the right to purchase the hydroelectric power generated at \nmultipurpose Federal water projects at cost-based rates, these \ncustomers have provided a significant portion of the funds needed to \nbuild and operate the water projects. In addition to power production \nthese projects serve other significant purposes, including making water \navailable for irrigation, flood control, navigation, municipal and \nindustrial water supply, wildlife enhancement, recreation, and salinity \ncontrol. In many instances, the beneficiaries of these nonpower \npurposes of the water projects have paid little, if anything, for the \nprojects.\n  Some are not suggesting that the Government renege on its agreement \nwith the power customers by eliminating their right to purchase the \npower produced at Federal water projects. In addition to being patently \nunfair, the breach of this covenant with the power customers raises \nserious questions about the integrity of future agreements entered into \nbetween the Government and private parties.\n  The five power marketing administrations currently sell power to \nmunicipal and electric cooperative utilities serving millions of \nconsumers in 34 States. Privatization of the PMA's could result in \ntremendous rate increases for these customers. In some areas, retail \nresidential rates could triple. A recent study prepared by the \nCongressional Research Service estimated that PMA privatization could \ncause electric rates to rise by $1.2 to $1.3 billion per year.\n  The Southwestern Power Administration [SWPA] currently sells power \nproduced at Federal water projects to customers in my home State of \nArkansas, as well as in Kansas, Louisiana, Missouri, Oklahoma, and \nTexas. The privatization of SWPA could cause serious adverse economic \nconsequences in the region. A study prepared when President Reagan \nfirst proposed privatizing SWPA indicated that consumers in Arkansas \nalone could stand to pay as much as 343 percent more to replace the \npower currently purchased from\n SWPA. Mr. President, I don't want to go back to my constituents and \ntell them that they are going to have to pay three times as much for \nelectricity because the Government no longer wants to honor a \ncontractual commitment.\n\n  Rather than roll up our sleeves and make the tough choices in order \nto reduce the Federal budget deficit, some Members of Congress instead \nwant to resort to budgetary gimmicks. The sale of Government assets to \nincrease the Government's cash flow, in the short term, might be the \nmost cynical gimmick of them all. Because budget scoring periods run \nfor 5 or 10 years, it is tempting to take actions that would reduce the \ndeficit during the scoring period, but would actually increase the \ndeficit in the out-years. This is exactly what would happen if the \nPMA's are privatized. Selling-off the PMA's could very well produce $2 \nbillion in revenues immediately. However, because the PMA's would no \nlonger be selling power on the Government's behalf, the immediate \nincrease in revenues would be offset by the revenues forgone resulting \nfrom the sale of the assets.\n  In 1990 Congress amended the Budget Act to prohibit the use of \nreceipts from the sale of Federal assets to be scored as a reduction in \nthe deficit. The purpose of this provision is to prevent the use of \ngimmickry to create an illusion that we are balancing the budget. Mr. \nPresident, I fully expect that efforts will be made this year to repeal \nthis prohibition. I intend to fight any such efforts that would make it \nmore difficult to honestly balance the budget.\n  Mr. President, I recognize that we live in a new era and that \nstreamlining Government and making it more efficient are not only \ndesirable, but necessary. In this spirit, I am willing to wok with \ncritics of the PMA's in order to make them more efficient. But I will \nnot support any legislation that would abrogate the covenant between \nthe Government and the PMA customers which provides reasonably priced \npower to more than 1,000 consumer owned electric systems in the United \nStates.\n                     power marketing administration\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I rise today in opposition to President \nClinton's budget proposal for fiscal year 1996 to sell the Western \nArea, Southwestern, and especially the Southeastern Power \nAdministrations to private investors.\n  In Virginia, the electric cooperatives and the municipal power \nsystems represent almost a million citizens who receive a significant \nportion of electricity from the Kerr-Philpott hydro facilities located \nin southside Virginia. It is estimated that preferred customers under \nthe electric cooperatives can expect annual increases of approximately \n$100 per year should the Southeastern Power Administration be sold.\n  I believe that it is fiscally irresponsible to turn the Power \nMarketing Administrations over to private interests, which will in turn \npenalize our consumers by driving up their rates. These members have \nalready paid for a significant portion of investment in these \nfacilities and nearly twice that amount in interest. SEPA has already \nrepaid $433 million, or 30 percent, of the $1.442 invested.\n  The Federal Government is currently recovering its investment in SEPA \nfacilities through the rates charged for the hydroelectric power \ngenerated to the customers in southside. This investment should be \nviewed as a contract with the ratepayers of the cooperatives to \ncontinue service with the Federal Government.\n  While the sale of the PMA's would provide the Department of the \nTreasury with the desired instant cash flow, we must consider how these \nFederal power sales will continue to generate revenue long after the \nprojects are repaid.\n  The Power Marketing Administration should be valued for its assets, \nfor the income it produces to pay its own way, and for the service it \nprovides to the members of the cooperatives. For \n[[Page S6023]] these reasons, I believe that the sale of the Power \nMarketing Administrations is not an efficient means of contributing to \ndeficit reduction and should not be considered as a means of deficit \nreduction.\n\n\n                    power marketing administrations\n\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, I will not take a great deal of time this \nmorning, but I wanted to reiterate my strong opposition to the sale of \nthe Power Marketing Administrations. I've made similar points with the \nDirector of the OMB. And I sat to discuss this matter with the \nPresident.\n  We seem to go through this exercise just about every year, regardless \nof who is in the White House or who controls Congress. Until someone \ncan show me some real benefits of privatization, I will continue to \noppose the sale of the PMA's.\n  The Power Marketing Administration's deliver a critically important \nservice to a large portion of the Nation. They are an example of what's \nright with Government. It seems ironic and very ill advised that they \nshould be put on the auction block and I will not stand for any \nwholesale dismantling of the PMA system.\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. Mr. President, I concur and agree with Senator \nExon and I want the Record to state that.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I have spoken in the past about my \ncommitment to continuing the production and distribution of clean, \nreliable hydropower through Federal Power Marketing Administrations. \nToday, I reaffirm this commitment.\n  The Federal power program has served well both the taxpaying public \nand energy consumers. It serves the taxpaying public by paying its own \nway--and paying interest on its debt. It also serves the general public \nby providing navigation, flood control, recreation, fish and wildlife \nconservation, and irrigation. Few Federal programs can claim such far-\nreaching benefits at such a low cost.\n  Mr. President, if we sell our PMA's, we cannot be assured that the \ngeneral public will continue to reap these many benefits. While the \nsale of PMA's would product short-term revenue, the sale will do little \nto solve the long-term problem of our Nation's debt. In fact, the \npermanent loss of these productive assets will result in foregoing \nfuture revenues likely to be in the billions of dollars.\n  At this time, the Bonneville Power Administration is not immediately \nthreatened with sale. Several months ago, however, officials within the \nadministration suggested to the President that he sell BPA to finance a \ntax cut. Fortunately, after hearing from Senators and Representatives \nfrom the Pacific Northwest, President Clinton elected to decline that \nadvice. Recognizing the special attributes of BPA, he has said he does \nnot intend to offer it for sale. So, my constituents appear to be safe \nfor now.\n  I speak in opposition to the sale of the other PMA's because I \nbelieve their sale is not in the best interest of either the taxpaying \npublic or the tens of millions of consumers who will certainly be \nsaddled with higher electricity bills. Let us reject this short-term \nsolution to our deficit and protect our Federal assets for the next \ngenerations of Americans.\n              Sale of the Power Marketing Administrations\n\n  Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, like may of my colleagues, I rise today to \nbriefly address the President's fiscal year 1996 budget proposal to \nprivatize some of the Power Marketing Administrations [PMA's], \nincluding the Southeastern Power Marketing Administration [SEPA], which \nserves many Virginians.\n  I am concerned about the devastating effects of the privatization of \nthe Southeastern Power Administration and other PMA's on rural electric \nproviders and their consumers. Prior to the fiscal year 1996 budget \nsubmission, I contacted President Clinton and OMB Director Alice Rivlin \nand asked for this proposal to be reconsidered. Like many of my \nDemocratic colleagues. I was disappointed to find this one-time asset \nsale in the final budget proposal.\n  Nationwide 650 rural electric systems receive allocations of power \nfrom Federal projects. Eleven of our thirteen Virginia rural electric \ncooperatives get a portion of their power direct from the Southeastern \nPower Administration. Over the years, Federal hydropower has helped \nrural electric cooperatives keep their rates competitive with investor-\nowned utilities.\n  If we are serious about deficit reduction, we must ensure that all of \nour Federal programs continue to provide significant benefits to our \ntaxpayers. In my opinion, this proposal to sell SEPA and other PMA's is \npenny-wise, but pound-foolish. I would favor any proposal for deficit \nreduction, so long as the savings result from sound public policy. Our \nFederal power program benefits consumers, taxpayers, and continues to \nfacilitate economic growth and development in rural areas across the \ncountry. Privatizing the PMA's will not produce benefits that outweigh \nthe current program and is, in my judgment, bad public policy.\n  We should oppose the sale of the PMA's for several budgetary reasons. \nIn the first place, the Government would lose a stream of revenue \nflowing into the Federal Treasury if the PMA's were sold. The estimated \nrevenues which go to the Treasury exceed the appropriations for the \nPMA's. In fiscal year 1995, it is estimated that the net positive \nreceipts to the Federal Treasury will be $243 million.\n  Given this situation, the fiscal advantage to the Federal Government \nof selling the PMA's is time limited. During the year in which sales \nare actually occurring, the Treasury would receive a windfall in \nreceipts as monies received from the sales and saved from \nappropriations overwhelm the revenues lost as a result of the sale. \nHowever, as the foregone\n revenues exceed the saved appropriations in the years after the sales, \nwe would be adding to the deficit.\n\n  Because capital asset sales are a one-time event. We have a budget \nrule that assets sales should not be counted in the budget. If we were \nto count the proceeds from selling Government assets as though they \nwere receipts of the Federal Government, then these one-time receipts \ncould be used to fund new spending programs or tax cuts that outlive \nthe stream of receipts. We should follow the budget rule and not allow \nthese fleeting savings to be counted as budget savings.\n  Another budgetary reason to oppose the sale of the PMA's is that the \nFederal Government could actually lose money if the sale price were \ninadequate to cover the present value of the federally-held debt. One \nstudy indicates that the revenue from the Alaska Power Administration \nunder the current program would be higher than under its proposed sale. \nIf this is the case with the APA, it could be equally true of the \nothers. Given these budgetary uncertainties, we should not be rushing \nto privatize these entities.\n  The PMA's remain an integral part of our commitment to bring \naffordable and efficient hydroelectric power to the many Americans \ndependent on rural cooperatives and municipal power systems. PMA's are \na wise and profitable investment on behalf of rural America.\n  We have made great strides in bringing electric power and other \nutilities to rural areas, largely through the work of rural electric \ncooperatives, and we should carefully consider the consequences of \neliminating this valuable supply of electricity now.\n  I respectfully urge all of my colleagues to join me and support the \ncontinuation of Federal power.\n                    power marketing administrations\n\n  Mr. HATFIELD. Mr. President, I am pleased to join with a number of my \ncolleagues from both sides of the aisle who have come to the floor this \nmorning to shed some light on proposals to sell off the Federal power \nmarketing administrations. I continue to oppose such proposals, not \nonly as they relate to the Bonneville Power Administration, but also as \nthey relate to the other power marketing administrations.\n  Power Marketing Administrations are entities that have been created \nto market the power generated by Federal hydropower projects operated \nby the Army Corps of Engineers. PMA's are part of the Department of \nEnergy's Federal power marketing program. One of the central features \nof this program is the preference clause, which allows consumer-owned, \nnonprofit local utility systems to have the preferential access to the \npower produced by Federal dams.\n  The five PMA's are as follows: The Southeastern Power Administration \n[[Page S6024]] [SEPA], the Southwestern Power Administration [SWPA], \nthe Western Area Power Administration [WAPA], the Bonnville Power \nAdministration [BPA], and the Alaska Power Administration [APA].\n  The President's budget includes provisions for the sale of each of \nthese PMA's except BPA. Proposals are pending in the House to either \nsell all or some of the PMA's or require them to sell their power at \nmarket rates, the definition of which appears to this Senator to lead \nto highly inflated and unrealistic prices.\n  My opposition to the sale of the PMA's is based on my view that it is \nshortsighted public policy to sell one of the few revenue generating \nassets of the Federal Government. It is important to remember that BPA \nis repaying, with interest, the capital investments in the Federal \nhydropower projects in the Columbia Basin. The other PMA's are making \nsimilar payments. When the repayment is completed, the Federal \nGovernment will be the owners of these projects. The PMA's pay their \nway and then some. I ask unanimous consent that a table showing project \ninvestments and repayment by PMA's be printed at this point in the \nRecord.\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, I wish to voice my opposition to any efforts \nto privatize parts of the Federal Power Marketing Administrations \nincluding the Southwestern, Southeastern, or Western Area Power \nAdministration.\n  This Nation made a commitment to bring affordable and efficient \nhydroelectric power to rural customers. In conjunction with thousands \nof rural cooperatives and municipal power systems across the country, \nFederal Power Marketing Administrations [PMA's] have met that \ncommitment.\n  The utilities purchase power through the PMA's and the revenues cover \nPMA operating expenses, construction costs, and interest payments. And \nthese sales put money into the Federal Treasury.\n  The proposed sale of these PMA's not only jeopardizes that commitment \nto rural Americans, but upsets the sensitive dynamics of the many dam \nprojects from which the PMA's market their power.\n  These dams perform an array of services, including power generation, \nnavigation, flood control, water supply, recreation, and fish and \nwildlife preservation. As a government entity PMA's have effectively \nbalanced these sometimes diverse, and often competing functions.\n  As several colleagues and I told President Clinton in a letter back \nin January, there is no indication that a private, for-profit entity \ncan be expected to become a full-partner in these interests at an \nalmost certain loss of profits.\n  And what about the consumer? They essentially lose twice. Estimates \nshow increases of as much as 30 to 50 percent per month for some \nresidential rates. That's a frightening prospect for many families who \nare already living from paycheck to paycheck.\n  The consumer gets hit a second time when the Federal Treasury \nexperiences a loss of that steady revenue I mentioned earlier. Because \nthe Federal Power Program pays for all investments made, once \nconstruction, and interests costs are repaid, the Federal Government \nwill own the power plants. But once sold, no revenue. And that's bad \nnews for consumers at a time when reducing the deficit is critical to \ncontinued economic stability.\n  The Federal Power Program is one that assures access for rural \nresidents to affordable electricity, returns much-needed revenue to the \nFederal Treasury, and effectively balances the many demands on these \ndams--from flood control to water supply to recreation. Clearly, this \nis not the kind of program Congress should add to the auction block, \nand I urge my colleagues to oppose any such efforts.\n  There being no objection, the table was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n\n                 pma's pay back principal with interest\n\n       Customers of the federal power marketing administrations \n     are required by law to pay back the investment in federal \n     hydropower facilities with interest. They are doing so, as \n     shown in the table below:\n\n                                   STATUS OF REPAYMENT AS OF SEPT. 30, 1993\\1\\                                  \n                                        [Cumulative dollars in millions]                                        \n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                       Operation               Interest   Cumulative            \n         Location              Power         Power     & maint.

Mr. President, the five PMA's carry out a distinctive \nmission, including both power and nonpower functions. For example, the \nBonneville Power Administration's primary function is to market power \ngenerated by the Corps of Engineers dams in the Columbia River Basin. \nThey also have significant involvement in implementing regional \nconservation measures, regional fishery recovery and conservation \nmeasures, and regional renewable energy programs. It is unlikely that \nthe private sector would be willing to fulfill these public duties in \nthe absence of PMA's.\n  This is of particular interest to the Northwest, where BPA is, under \ncurrent plans, expected to shoulder the vast majority of the costs of \nsalmon recovery. While many in the Northwest have argued that BPA \nshould not be required to bear the entire burden of these recovery \ncosts, to remove BPA from the picture leaves a void that would be \ndifficult if not impossible to fill.\n  A number of economists have questioned the true fiscal benefit of \nselling Federal assets such as the PMA's. Not only would such a sale \nrequire the budget scoring rules of the Senate and the House to be \nfundamentally altered in order to show any positive deficit impact, it \nwould also be of questionable benefit to the deficit problems we face. \nAs Harvard Prof. Martin Feldstein has pointed out:\n\n       Although Government accounting methods would make it look \n     as if Federal spending and receipts are in better balance, \n     these asset sales would do nothing to lessen the burden of \n     the deficit. That burden occurs because Government borrowing \n     to finance the deficit preempts savings that would otherwise \n     be available for private investment in plant and equipment \n     and in housing construction. The administration's proposed \n     assets sales would preempt private savings every bit as much \n     as a Federal sales of new debt of the same value.\n\n  Mr. President, over the last decade, I have seen many shortsighted \nproposals by successive administrations to sell off or alter \nsubstantially the power marketing administrations. I have had to fight \nthese proposals each time and will continue to do so. As budget \ndeficits grew, a cash-starved Federal Government looked to all sources \nof revenue generation to produce more dollars. The power marketing \nadministrations, which produce large sums of annual revenues, became \neasy targets for those who look only at the bottom line. Little or no \nconsideration was given to the impacts on local economies or the \noverall impact on Federal revenues.\n  [[Page S6025]] While none of these proposals ultimately was \nsuccessful, each created a cost for the economies which depend on PMA \nelectric power. Electricity is the cornerstone of much of the Nation's \neconomy, particularly in the Pacific Northwest. The high reliability \nand low cost of electric power provides the United States, and \nespecially the Pacific Northwest, with a global competitive advantage \nwhich benefits the entire Nation.\n  As each of these proposals were made, uncertainty over the future \ncost of electricity was created. In the Pacific Northwest, where over \nhalf the electric power consumed is marketed by the Bonneville Power \nAdministration, these proposals cast a cloud of uncertainty over future \nelectric power prices. Rate increases of the magnitude contemplated by \nthe proposals would devastate the economy of the region by discouraging \ninvestment in infrastructure, including modernization of new plants and \nequipment, and close factories and businesses which operate on the \nmargin, many of which were attracted to the availability of low cost \nhydroelectric power in the region. The benefit of these proposals has \noverstated by every administration because the potential for lost tax \nrevenue as a result of business failure or lack of investment was never \ntaken into account.\n  In conclusion, Mr. President, proposals to sell off these revenue \ngenerating entities that are such fundamental importance to the local \nand regional economies they serve are misguided and will be opposed by \nthis Senator. I am pleased to join with my colleagues to reinforce the \nimportance of this issue.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I would like to speak for just a moment on \nthis PMA matter and then direct my attention to another issue. Who \ncontrols time?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair would inquire of the Senator from \nNorth Dakota if he is speaking on the time of his colleague from North \nDakota?\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the Senator from \nNorth Dakota be allowed to speak for 9 minutes in the time reserved for \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from North Dakota is recognized for up to 9 minutes.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/05/03/senate-section/article/S6021-2", "month": "05", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "03", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6025]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  THE POWER MARKETING ADMINISTRATIONS\n\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I thank the Chair and thank my colleague. \nI would like to speak just briefly on the PMA matter and then speak on \nanother issue as well.\n  With respect to the PMA matter, I salute my colleagues who have come \nto the floor to oppose the sale of PMA's. Let me say I believe sale of \nthe Power Marketing Administrations represents a very bad idea. It is \nbad for rural America. It represents bad faith. It is bad economics and \nit is bad policy.\n  This would have a very serious impact on rural America. In my State \nwe would see an increase in rates of up to 60 percent; 240,000 \ncustomers in North Dakota would be adversely affected. Those rural \ncustomers are already paying rates that are 15 to 40 percent higher \nthan city customers. The reason for that, of course, is very obvious. \nThere is much less of a load per mile in rural areas than in city \nareas, so the costs are higher.\n  Mr. President, this would be a very serious matter for rural America. \nIt also represents bad faith. The Government made a deal. The deal was \nthis power was going to go to help rural America. That is precisely why \nthe Federal Government entered into this enterprise. Preference power, \nit should be emphasized, is not a subsidy. These facilities are being \nrepaid with interest. I believe the sale also represents bad economics. \nSelling the PMA's would be a one-time shot. It does not reduce the \ndeficit because their own budget rules say you cannot sell assets to \nreduce the deficit. So, Mr. President, selling these facilities forgo \ndecades of steady income.\n  Finally, I believe the PMA sale represents bad policy. These dams \nserve multiple purposes. No private entity can balance the interests of \npower production with flood control, navigation, water supply, and \nwildlife values.\n  Mr. President, for those reasons I oppose the sale of the PMA's.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/05/03/senate-section/article/S6025-1", "month": "05", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "03", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6025-S6026]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          WHERE IS THE BUDGET?\n\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, today is May 3. I think it is time to \nstart asking the question of our colleagues on the other side, where is \nthe budget? Where is the budget? We are supposed to have completed \naction on the budget in the Budget Committee by April 1. Today is May \n3. We still do not see a budget. I am on the Budget Committee. I still \ndo not know when we are even going to start to work on the budget.\n  Mr. President, I must say I am somewhat surprised because our friends \non the other side of the aisle had a budget before the election. They \ntold the American people that they had a budget plan. They said they \ncould cut taxes, they said they could increase defense spending, and \nthey said they could balance the budget. But now that they have assumed \npower and assumed control and assumed authority, there is no budget.\n  Mr. President, it is amazing the difference an election makes. Before \nthe election there was this plan. They had the Contract With America. \nThey told everybody they had this miracle. It was not going to reveal \nthe details but a miracle plan that was going to allow them to cut \ntaxes dramatically, increase defense spending, and balance the budget. \nNow that they are in power their plan is missing in action. Maybe it is \nbecause the plan just does not add up. This chart shows what we would \nneed to do to balance the budget over the next 7 years. We would have \nto have a reduction in spending of $1.2 trillion to begin with. Then if \nwe were going to be true to the promise we have made to Social Security \nrecipients, they would have to cover the $636 billion in Social \nSecurity surpluses that are going to be generated during that 7-year \nperiod.\n  So now the hole to fill in is $1.8 trillion--not million, not \nbillion, but trillion dollars. That is real money even in Washington \ntalk. On top of that, of course, we are going to have to cover the \nmassive tax cuts that the House has passed, $345 billion of tax cuts \nover the 7-year period. So that is the hole that we have to fill in, \n$2.2 trillion.\n  Unfortunately, before they ever started to fill in this hole, they \ndug the hole deeper by passing these massive tax cuts.\n  Let us see what they have produced so far by way of proposals to \nnarrow the gap between the $2.2 trillion we need, and what they have \nactual done so far over in the House in terms of proposal. They are \ndown here at a measly, anemic, $485 billion.\n  Mr. President, I would say our friends on the other side of the aisle \nhave a credibility gap that is opening up here. In fact, it is more \nthan a gap. It is a chasm. They are $1.6 trillion short. No wonder we \ndo not see a budget out here. No wonder they have blown the deadline. \nNo wonder they have not even started in the Budget Committee and they \nwere supposed to be completed a month ago.\n  It is amazing. During the balanced budget amendment debate there was \na rush to amend the Constitution to balance the budget. Boy, that was \npriority No. 1. But now when it comes time to actually do something to \nbalance the budget, because of course, a balanced budget amendment will \nnot cut one dime, will not add one dime of revenue, will not narrow the \ndeficit by a dollar--now, when it comes time to actually present a \nbudget, to actually do something about the deficit, the budget plan is \nnowhere to be found. This just does not add up. It does not add up, and \nnot surprisingly our colleagues on the other side are more focused on a \ntax cut for the wealthiest among us than presenting a plan to reduce \nthe deficit.\n  It is very interesting. If you look at who benefits from the \nRepublican tax bill, what one finds is if you are a family of four \nearning over $200,000 a year, you get an $11,000 tax cut. If you are a \nfamily of four earning $30,000 a year, you get $124.\n  So the idea of our friends on the other side is to target tax relief \nin this country by giving 100 times as much to those earning over \n$200,000 a year than those earning $30,000 a year, and they call this \nmiddle-class tax relief. It is an interesting concept of the middle \nclass. \n[[Page S6026]] It is an interesting concept of focusing tax relief.\n  Mr. President, we have seen this plan before. We have seen it all \nbefore--back in the 1980's. If we look back at that time, we see what \nhappens to the middle class. Do they benefit from this kind of plan to \ngive big tax cuts to the wealthiest among us and explode the deficit? \nNo. We can look back and see what happened in the 1980's. The top 1 \npercent saw 62 percent of the wealth growth go to them. The top 1 \npercent got 62 percent of the wealth growth in that period. The 80 \npercent at the bottom saw their wealth growth of 1.2 percent. That is \ntrickle-down economics. What we have learned is that wealth does not \ntrickle down. It gets sucked up. The wealthiest 1 percent get all the \nbenefits.\n  Mr. President, let me just conclude by saying our friends on the \nother side have got to come up with a budget. Then we are going to see \nthe gap between rhetoric and reality.\n  I thank the Chair. I yield the floor.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, Webster's define a tax as a requirement to \npay a percentage of income from property or value for support of the \nGovernment. So we can see that a tax can come in many forms--a direct \nlevy, or a hidden fee that sneaks up on the taxpayers under a cover \nname. That is precisely what the Clinton administration and some here \nin Congress have in mind for many Montana and western ratepayers.\n  As you may be aware, the administration in their fiscal year 1996 \nbudget proposes to sell off four Power Marketing Sdministrations: \nAlaska Power, Southeastern Power, Southwestern Power, and the Western \nArea Power Administration, otherwise known as WAPA which brings low-\ncost electricity to thousands of eastern Montana families, ranchers, \nfarms, and small businesses. They have found enthusiastic allies in the \nnew House leadership. And together they say they will privatize these \nelectricity providers. They predict a windfall, a one-time profit of \n$3.7 billion. If anyone promises you a free $3.7 billion, we all know \nyou had better think carefully. You had better look at it real close. \nThere is no exception.\n  I submit that privatizing the Power Marketing Administrations is a \nbad idea. It is shortsighted, and it hurts. It does not help. It hurts \nrural America. Privatization cannot work when its result is to simply \ncreate four huge monopolies which will gouge their capital market like \nany other monopoly.\n  So at its core, the proposal to sell off PMA's is no more than back-\ndoor tax repeal. To sell off the PMA's is no more than a back-door tax \nincrease on the middle class. A tax hidden in the utility bill is every \nbit as much a tax as a gas tax, an income tax, or anything else. This \nis a tax, a tax increase on rural America.\n  The chart, Mr. President, tells it a little bit; $129 is the monthly \nbill of a typical residential customer in this area in Montana. This is \nfrom Marais. Marais residents will find their bill will increase 45 \npercent, which is $190 a month, as opposed to $129.72 every month.\n  What does that mean? That means that Montana, like much of the West, \nwhich is built on hydroelectric power, will find their economies \ndeclining. By harnessing the Missouri River, Fort Peck Reservoir has \nprovided water to small industries which use the affordable power to \ncreate jobs and build communities, and folks in rural areas get \naffordable power to heat and light their homes, an essential service. \nIt is something that works and has worked ever since Franklin Roosevelt \ncame out to break ground at the Fort Peck Dam and bring public power to \nrural Montana.\n  Public power meant electricity an ordinary farm family could afford. \nIt helped create Montana communities like Glasgow, Sidney, Shelby, and \nit keeps towns like these strong and healthy. As my friend Ethel Parker \nat Fort Shaw says,\n\n       I have lived on a farm all my life; started out south of \n     Geyser in central Montana in a semiarid prairie farm. The REA \n     came to us in the early 1940's. Low-cost electricity has made \n     life livable for those of us who raise the food and fiber for \n     all Americans. Now Congress would knock our pins out from \n     under us.\n\n  There are 100,000 Montana families, one in three of all the men, \nwomen, and children in Montana, that depend on WAPA and share Mrs. \nParker's feelings, and they stand to see their power bills increased by \n25 cents on the average on the dollar if this proposal goes forward. \nYou are talking about real tangible cuts in the living standards for \ntowns like Fort Shaw and all over the country, and that is why I am a \nstaunch supporter of WAPA and equally against the sale of the PMA's.\n  The second point is that WAPA and the other power marketing programs \ntake not one tax dollar. In fact, the Federal Government actually makes \nmoney off of these programs. WAPA is an example. The Federal Government \nhas invested a total of $5.6 billion in WAPA, and each year the WAPA \npays the Federal Government approximately $380 million for this loan, \nwith interest, that is starting to be paid back. And so far the Federal \nTreasury has gotten back $4.1 billion on its initial loan. By the time \nthis debt is retired in 24 years, the Federal Treasury will have made \n$14 billion on its initial investment of $5.6 billion. Even now, the \nPMA's run a profit for the Government. A recently released CRS report \non the PMA's found that the Federal Treasury actually earns a profit of \n$244 million a year.\n  To repeat, Mr. President, a recently released CRS report on the PMA's \nfound that the Federal Treasury actually earns a profit of $244 million \na year on the PMA's. It is a profit. It does not add to the deficit, \nMr. President. It decreases the deficit. So you have to look hard and \nyou have to look long to find a Federal program that provides a good \nservice to the public and makes a profit. WAPA provides a service and \nit makes a profit.\n  I find it incredibly shortsighted that the administration would want \nto sell America's infrastructure for a quick, one-time shot at cash--\njoined, I might add, by the House leadership. They also want to sell \nWAPA. So what's next--our highways, our bridges, our national parks? \nThe principle is the same. America's infrastructure up for sale. That \nis what they want.\n  It does not make any sense to me, and I do not intend to stand by and \nlet it proceed without a fight. And I serve notice, Mr. President, I \nintend to do everything I can to see that this proposal is defeated. We \nwill shut the door on this misguided backdoor tax.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I thank the Chair.\n\n\n                             SALE OF PMA'S\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I shall be brief. I was one of the \nfirst Senators--and I am glad to be out here with colleagues on both \nsides of the aisle--to oppose the idea of selling the PMA's. I have \nspoken with the President. I have spoken with Alice Rivlin at OMB. I \nhave spoken to relevant Budget Committee members and written letters to \nother Senators.\n  I basically see it this way. If you sell the PMA's, if the Government \nshould sell the PMA's above current value, the only people who would \nwant to buy them, some of the private investor-owned utility companies \nwould want to buy them in order to raise rates. That is the only way \nthey can make up the difference, in which case the ratepayers suffer. \nIf you sell the PMA's at below current value, then this is a loss for \nthe taxpayers. If you sell the PMA's at exactly the current value, \ninsulating both the taxpayer and the ratepayer, then the only thing you \nare doing is privatizing for the sake of privatizing. So this proposal \nmakes absolutely no sense.\n  Mr. President, I believe in the mission of the PMA's and the \nlongstanding contract of the Western Power Administration with \nMinnesotans, and I think to sell these PMA's would be a serious mistake \nfor greater Minnesota. \n[[Page S6027]] In western Minnesota, WAPA provides hydroelectric power \nat production costs to rural electric cooperatives, municipal \nutilities, hospitals, school districts, and Federal facilities. Without \nthis program, the energy bill for people in greater Minnesota could \nrise as much as $400 a year per customer--could rise as much as $400 \nper year per customer.\n  In this time of budget cutting, it is important to point out that \nWAPA is not an example of wasteful Government spending. In fact, \nthrough WAPA we actually pay off a Government loan. And more \nimportantly, WAPA is a Government program that recognizes the unique \nneeds of rural communities that lack the access to affordable energy \nenjoyed by their metropolitan neighbors.\n  Rural Minnesota is willing to do its part as our country works to \nreduce the Federal deficit, including selling wasteful Government \noperations. But eliminating a program that does not cost money and \nactually contributes to the health of the rural economy is an example \nof cutting for cutting's sake. It makes neither economic sense nor \ncommon sense, and that is why, as a Senator from Minnesota, I put this \nbattle at the very top of my list of priorities.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DORGAN and Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I have been in the Chamber some while. It \nis my intention to speak for 5 minutes on the PMA matter and then claim \nthe additional 3 minutes on the morning business that was reserved.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota is recognized \nfor 8 minutes.\n  The Chair would advise the Senator from Illinois that she does have \nreserved time to speak for up to 10 minutes and prior to taking the \nadditional 5 minutes, we would recognize the Senator from North Dakota \nfor the remaining 3 minutes and then the Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I would ask if the allotted time for \nmorning business then allows for the full complement of time reserved \nfor the Senator from Illinois; is that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I thank the Chair.\n\n\n                           SALE OF THE PMA'S\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I should like to add my voice to the \nthoughts expressed today by the Senator from South Dakota and the \nSenator from Montana and others on the matter of the sale of the Power \nMarketing Administrations, the PMA's.\n  This does not mean much to a lot of people because we hear the use of \nacronyms and titles of organizations with which most people are not \nfamiliar. But the power marketing administrations, along with WAPA, \nwhich is the PMA that serves our region of the country, provide a very \nimportant mission and role for our region of the country and help \nprovide, for a couple hundred thousand North Dakotans, reasonably low-\ncost power that has been a Federal promise to them for a long, long \nwhile.\n  We produce power through hydroelectric facilities that were built in \nconjunction with the construction of dams and reservoirs. Those \nprojects have many purposes, including flood control and a range of \nother critical needs.\n  Part of the promise in the construction of those dams and the public \nworks projects over time was the promise of being able to use the \nelectricity from the hydropower generators and distribute it regionally \nat a reasonable cost. That has been of enormous benefit to rural \nconsumers in my State, who, without this opportunity, would see their \nelectric rates skyrocket.\n  The President has proposed selling the PMA's. The leaders of the \nHouse have proposed selling the PMA's. It does not make any sense, in \nmy judgment, to do that. These are investments we have made. Payments \nhave been made under these investments, on time and with interest. The \nPMA's are a $21 billion investment. The customers of the electricity, \nthe ratepayer in rural America, have repaid $5.1 billion in principle \nand have paid $8.8 billion in interest.\n  For those in Washington to force the sale of the PMA's would be kind \nof like a hostile takeover when somebody comes along and says, ``Well, \nit is true, you made your payments. You bought this. Now we are going \nto sell it out from under you.''\n  It is not the right thing to do. I do not know why the President \nincluded it in his budget recommendation. It was, in my judgment, \nfoolish to have done so. It does not make good economic sense. I think \nit breaks a Federal promise, and I think it is actually moving in the \nwrong direction. I hope, on a bipartisan basis, that we will find a way \nhere in the Senate to put the blocks against these wheels and say, ``No \nmore. You are not going to move this forward.''\n  If someone happens to think that selling the PMA's is going to reduce \nthe Federal budget deficit, they should understand that, according to \nour budget law, you cannot sell assets and claim that you have now \nreduced the budget deficit. It does not do that under our budget rules.\n  But, I hope that the Senator from South Dakota, Senator Pressler, \nSenator Baucus, Senator Conrad, Senator Wellstone, myself, and so many \nothers who care a great deal about this, will be able to work together \nin a bipartisan way with the President and the leadership in the U.S. \nHouse, to show that that is an idea whose time has never come and one \nthat we must defeat this year.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Santorum). The Senator's time has expired.\n  The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask for the remaining 3 minutes of my \ntime under the order. When the Chair indicated that my time had \nexpired, I assume the Chair was speaking of the 5 minutes under the PMA \ndiscussion.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator had 3 minutes remaining, and that \ntime has expired.\n  Mr. DORGAN. When I sought the floor, I sought to use the 5 minutes \nunder the PMA discussion that was under a previous unanimous-consent, \nafter which I had 3 minutes remaining in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There was time for a list of speakers. My \nunderstanding is that you have used up all of your time under that \nlist.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, there was how much time reserved for \nSenator Baucus and Senator Pressler to discuss PMA in morning business?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Senator Baucus had no time, and spoke under \nthe normal 5-minute limit under Senate rules in morning business. \nSenator Pressler had 30 minutes.\n  Mr. DORGAN. How much of that time was used?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Senator Pressler had 20 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. DORGAN. My understanding is that is available in 3-minute \nincrements for those of us who wish to speak about PMA's.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Parliamentarian advises me that there was \nno such order that allows that to be done under Senator Pressler's \ntime.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I disagree with the Parliamentarian.\n  Let me ask unanimous consent that I be allowed to speak for 3 \nadditional minutes as per the previous agreement in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/05/03/senate-section/article/S6026-1", "month": "05", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "03", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6027-S6028]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                               THE BUDGET\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. In the remaining 3 minutes--and I appreciate the \nindulgence of the Senator from Illinois--I just want to discuss the \nissue raised by Senator Conrad a few minutes ago.\n  We had, not very long ago, an urgency on the floor of the Senate to \namend the U.S. Constitution to require a balanced budget, and the \nurgency was people moving around the floor here saying, ``We must do \nthis immediately. The country's future rests on it. It is critically \nimportant for the future of America. We must change the U.S. \nConstitution to require a balanced budget.''\n  And, of course, almost everyone knew that if the Constitution were \nchanged to require a balanced budget, not one penny's worth of \ndifference in the Federal deficit would have occurred, because you \ncannot reduce the \n[[Page S6028]] Federal deficit by changing the U.S. Constitution.\n  How do you do it? By writing a budget and bringing it to the floor of \nthe Senate. What is the requirement there? Well, the requirement is on \nApril 1, a budget is required by law to be brought to the floor of the \nSenate. On April 15, a conference report is to be passed on the budget.\n  Now, the question that many of us asks is: Where is the urgency \ntoday? Where is the budget? Is there a budget?\n  Well, we expect there is a budget somewhere. We cannot seem to see \nthe budget. We hope that those who claimed the reduction of the deficit \nwas so urgent--and it is--just a month or two ago would now understand \nthat urgency and meet their obligation to bring a budget to the floor \nof the Senate and begin to really cut Federal spending and really \nreduce the Federal budget deficit.\n  I said then and I will say again today that there is a difference \nbetween posing and lifting. There has been a lot of posing in this \nChamber in the last 3 or 4 months, but now it is time for some lifting. \nI think the American public and the Senate would be well served if \nthose who talked so much about changing the Constitution to eliminate \nthe Federal budget deficit would now be interested and willing to bring \na budget resolution to the floor of the Senate as required by law and \nreally start to dig in and reduce the Federal budget deficit.\n  Why has that not yet occurred? Because they have ridden into a box \ncanyon they call a middle-class tax cut which really gives most of the \nbenefits to the wealthy in this country, and at the same time they \nreally want to go ahead and cut about $300 billion out of Medicare and \nMedicaid. They have ridden into a box canyon and discovered they have \ndismounted, running for the bushes, and now they cannot find any plans. \nThey do not seem to have any notion at all about what to do about \nMedicare and Medicaid. They do not have a budget. They cannot bring it \nto the floor.\n  We do know this: They do have a tax-cut plan. It provides $11,200 a \nyear in tax cuts to families with over $200,000 in income and it \nprovides $120 a year to families with under $30,000 in income, and they \ncall it middle class. Middle class on Rodeo Drive, I guess, but not \nmiddle class anywhere else in this country.\n  Most of us in this Chamber who want to deal with the deficit honestly \nwant a budget and we want a budget that is real and does honest things. \nWe want to cut Federal spending where we are spending too much. We want \nsome additional revenues, to close some loopholes, and we want to \nreduce the Federal budget deficit. And we would like the majority \nparty, while they are at it, while they bring the budget resolution to \nthe floor, to jettison this tax cut and stop calling a tax cut for the \nwealthy a middle-class tax cut. It does not add up.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  The Senator from Illinois is recognized.\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN.

Mr. President, tonight the Leadership Conference \non Civil Rights, one of the country's leading civil rights \norganizations, will take time to honor its executive director, Ralph \nNeas, as he leaves his position after a 14-year tenure. I would like to \ntake a few moments to pay a brief tribute to this extraordinary \nindividual, as he embarks on a new career after devoting the past 20-\nplus years to public service.\n  There is an old African proverb which says ``God made the world round \nso we could not see too far down the road.'' I think it is fitting to \nmention that proverb here, as I first met Ralph Neas years ago, when we \nwere both students at the University of Chicago Law School. I do not \nthink that either of us could have imagined then that, some 20 years \nlater, I would be a U.S. Senator saluting my former classmate as one of \nour Nation's foremost civil rights leaders. But I always knew that \nRalph Neas would make a real difference, and I take great pride in his \naccomplishments, and I feel very lucky to be able to call him my \nfriend.\n  Mr. President, when Ralph Neas finished law school, the world was his \noyster. As one of the top graduates of the Chicago Law School, he could \nhave been hired by any of the major law firms, and he could have made a \ngreat deal of money in the process. Instead, he chose to devote his \nlife to public service. He joined the Congressional Research Service as \na legislative attorney on civil rights, but was soon hired to a \nlegislative assistant to Republican Senator Edward Brooke of \nMassachusetts, eventually becoming the Senator's chief legislative \nadviser. He stayed with Senator Brooke until his defeat in 1978, at \nwhich time he accepted a job as chief legislative assistant to Senator \nDurenberger of Minnesota. It was shortly after accepting the job with \nSenator Durenberger that Ralph was stricken with Guillian-Barre \nsyndrome. Within weeks of contracting the illness in February 1979, he \nhad been placed on a respirator and was paralyzed from the neck down. \nFor nearly 100 days, he lay in the hospital, kept alive by machines, \nunable to even speak. At one point, he was administered the last rites. \nWhen he recovered, he took an 8-month sabbatical, spending time touring \nEurope, drafting a book about his Guillian-Barre experience, and \nhelping to establish the Guillian-Barre Syndrome Foundation, now \nentitled the GBS Foundation International, which now has 15,000 members \nand 130 chapters throughout the world.\n  In the spring of 1981, Ralph was offered the job as executive \ndirector of the leadership conference. It was not the ideal time to \ntake a job as head of a civil rights organization. The Republicans had \njust captured the presidency and control of the Senate, and many of \nRalph's friends questioned why he would want to take such a demanding \njob after the experience he had endured. But as he stated later when \nasked about his decision:\n\n       I certainly had more than a few moments [while in the \n     hospital] to think about my life. Here I just came through an \n     experience where I had been a disabled individual, and here \n     [I was offered] a job that dealt with equal opportunity for \n     disabled people, and victims of discrimination. Whatever \n     happened in 1979 was not only important but there were some \n     reasons for it happening. I learned a lot of lessons and I \n     took the job.\n\n  Given the fact that the majority of Ralph Neas' tenure at the \nleadership conference was spent under Republican Presidents and \nRepublican Senates, it might be understandable if little was achieved. \nBut the Neas years were actually among the most productive that the \nleadership conference has ever had, a fact that is a tribute to his \nleadership. Ralph Neas was able to reach out to individuals on both \nsides of the aisle, and truly make civil rights a bipartisan issue.\n  But you do not have to take my word for it, Mr. President. All you \nhave to do is consider just a few of the civil rights\n victories that have been achieved during the Neas years. First and \nforemost, of course, is passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1991, a bill \nthat overturned a series of Supreme Court decisions that made it harder \nfor victims of discrimination to have their day in court. This \nlegislation codified the ``disparate impact'' standard, allowing \nplaintiffs to present statistical evidence of the composition of a \nworkplace in order to help prove their discrimination claims, and for \nthe first time provided monetary damages to women, persons with \ndisabilities, and certain religious minorities who were the victim of \nintentional job discrimination.\n\n  In addition, consider the passage of the Americans With Disabilities \nAct, one of the most significant and dramatic improvements in civil \nrights law in two decades. This bill extended civil rights protection \nin employment, transportation, communications, and public \naccommodations, and greatly improved the quality of life for 49 million \nAmericans with disabilities. During the Neas years, the leadership \nconference played a critical role in defeating repeated attempts to \nweaken or repeal Executive Order 11246, the Federal Executive order on \naffirmative action. I could go on, Mr. President, for there \n[[Page S6029]] is no shortage of achievements--the Voting Rights \nExtension Act of 1982, the Fair Housing Amendments Act of 1988, the \nJapanese-American redress bill of 1988, the Civil Rights Restoration \nAct, et cetera, but I think these few examples are sufficient to \nillustrate what an extraordinary contribution that Ralph Neas has made \nto the civil rights of our Nation.\n  Tonight, countless individuals from the civil rights community, from \nthe administration, and from Congress will gather to pay tribute to the \nremarkable leadership that Ralph Neas has provided the civil rights \ncommunity, the U.S. Congress, and even the Nation during the last 14 \nyears. This is not, however, a retirement. Ralph will continue his work \nin other ways, joining the Washington law firm of Fox, Bennett & Turner \nas counsel. While with the firm, he will establish an affiliate, the \nNeas group, that will provide strategic counseling to business and \nnonprofit institutions. In addition, Ralph will serve as a visiting \nprofessor at Georgetown University Law Center, teaching a course on the \nlegislative process. He will continue his work on the boards of the \nGuillian-Barre Syndrome Foundation International, the Disability Rights \nEducation and Defense Fund, and the Children's Charities Foundation. I \nhave no doubt that he will continue to provide those of us in the U.S. \nSenate with his invaluable advice and counsel, a fact for which I am \ngrateful.\n  Mr. President, when Ralph Neas was hospitalized with Guillian-Barre \nso many years ago, a nun at the hospital gave him a needlepoint sampler \nwhich read ``Nothing is so Full of Victory as Patience.'' I believe the \nreal hallmark of his work has been the consistency and unwavering \nvigilance--the patience--he has brought to his efforts to assure the \nenforcement of laws guaranteeing equality of opportunity to all \nAmericans. It is no exaggeration to say that millions of men and women \nof all races--who may never know you Ralph Neas by name--have benefited \ndirectly from his dedication and personal sacrifice in behalf of civil \nand human rights. He has made a positive, constructive difference for \nour Nation. I am pleased to have an opportunity on the floor here \ntoday, and at the dinner this evening, to celebrate his contributions. \nI know that I speak for many others in this body when I extend to him \nmy thanks, and my best wishes for his new career.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a statement by Dr. Dorothy I. Height, \nthe chairperson of the leadership conference, entitled ``The Neas Years \nat the Leadership Conference on Civil Rights,'' be placed in the Record \nfollowing my remarks.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                             The Neas Years\n\n                       (By Dr. Dorothy I. Height)\n\n       Last summer, Ralph G. Neas announced that he would be \n     leaving as Executive Director of the Leadership Conference on \n     Civil Rights (LCCR)* in the Spring of 1995. Much too soon \n     that time has come. As Ralph completes his fourteen-year \n     tenure at the helm of the Nation's oldest, largest, and most \n     broadly-based coalition, it is an appropriate moment to \n     reflect upon his extraordinary contributions to the cause of \n     equal opportunity for all Americans and some of the reasons \n     why he has earned his reputation as an effective leader, \n     strategist, advocate, and coalition builder.\n     *On May 3rd, at its Annual Dinner to be held at the Hyatt \n     Regency on Capitol Hill, the Leadership Conference will be \n     celebrating its 45th Anniversary and presenting its Hubert H. \n     Humphrey Civil Rights Award to Ralph G. Neas.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n                  the bipartisan legislative successes\n\n       Ralph Neas took over as Executive Director of the \n     Leadership Conference, the legislative arm of the civil \n     rights movement, on March 31, 1981, after eight years as a \n     chief legislative assistant to Republican Senators Edward W. \n     Brooke and Dave Durenberger. Ronald Reagan had just been \n     sworn in as president. Senators Strom Thurmond and Orrin \n     Hatch had just replaced Senators Edward Kennedy and Birch \n     Bayh as chairs of the Senate Judiciary Committee and the \n     Senate Subcommittee on the Constitution, respectively. The \n     previous year, Senator Hatch had successfully filibustered to \n     death the Leadership Conference's top legislative priority, \n     the Fair Housing Act of 1980. Many feared that a similar fate \n     awaited the Conference's top priority in the 97th Congress, \n     the legislation to extend the Voting Rights Act of 1965, \n     which was to be introduced in early April of 1981.\n       No small wonder then that many friends of Ralph, who just \n     two years earlier had been totally paralyzed, on a \n     respirator, and near death in a Minneapolis hospital room, \n     told him that this was not their idea of a brilliant career \n     move. But Ralph believed that his professional training in \n     the Senate, where he had been the senior staffer on civil \n     rights issues, and his bout with Guillain-Barre Syndrome, \n     which had profoundly influenced his life, had prepared him \n     for such a professional challenge.\n       The situation in the Spring of 1981 demanded \n     bipartisanship, creativity, pragmatism, and leadership. Ralph \n     and his LCCR colleagues showed an abundance of these \n     qualities during the arduous eighteen month campaign to enact \n     the 1982 Voting Rights Act Extension. Many people argued that \n     the time for federal control over local voting processes had \n     ended. But LCCR advocates demonstrated a continuing need and \n     their efforts helped pass the extension by votes of 389 to 24 \n     in the House of Representatives and 85 to 8 in the Senate, \n     leaving President Reagan with no choice but to sign the \n     historic measure into law. That law not only extended the \n     Voting Rights Act for 25 years, but also extended the Act's \n     bilingual assistance provisions and overturned a 1980 Supreme \n     Court decision by reinstating the results standard in the \n     Voting Rights Act.\n       The remarkable victory against great odds set the tone for \n     the next fourteen years for LCCR. Indeed, the 1982 Voting \n     Rights Act Extension campaign embodied several of Ralph's \n     principal legislative theorems. Theorem number one is to \n     always put together the strongest possible bipartisan bill \n     that can be enacted into law. During the twelve years of the \n     Reagan-Bush presidencies, that usually meant having at least \n     two-thirds majorities in both Houses. Theorem number two is \n     that any successful national legislative campaign must \n     effectively integrate grassroots, Washington lobbying, and \n     media strategies. If one component is absent, the legislative \n     campaign is likely to fail. And third, it is essential that \n     the coalition always remains cohesive and united, never \n     allowing adversaries to successfully use the tactics of \n     divide and conquer. If these basic principles are understood, \n     then one can comprehend the success of the 1982 Voting Rights \n     Act Extension and the legislative victories that followed.\n       And there were many other LCCR legislative successes. No \n     one could have predicted that more than two dozen LCCR \n     legislative priorities would be enacted into law during \n     Ralph's years at LCCR. In addition to the 1982 Voting Rights \n     Act Extension, Ralph coordinated many of these legislative \n     achievements for the Leadership Conference, including the:\n       Civil Rights Act of 1991--Overturned eight Supreme Court \n     decisions which had made it much more difficult for victims \n     of discrimination to get into court and to prove \n     discrimination (the first time Congress has ever overturned \n     more than one Supreme Court decision at one time). It also \n     codified the ``disparate impact'' standard. And it provided \n     for the first time monetary damages for women, persons with \n     disabilities, and certain religious minorities who are \n     victims of intentional job discrimination.\n       Americans with Disabilities Act (1990)--Perhaps the most \n     significant and dramatic improvement in civil rights law in \n     two decades. Provided civil rights protections in employment, \n     transportation, communications, and public\n      accommodations for the 49 million Americans with \n     disabilities.\n       Fair Housing Amendments Act of 1988--Provided for the first \n     time an effective enforcement mechanism. Also prohibited \n     discrimination against persons with disabilities and \n     discrimination against families with children.\n       Japanese-American Redress Bill (1988)--Apologized to \n     Japanese-Americans interned in prison camps in the United \n     States during World War II and authorized $20,000 to each of \n     those who are alive.\n       Civil Rights Restoration Act--Congress overrode a \n     presidential veto and overturned the 1984 Supreme Court Grove \n     City decision. The Civil Rights Restoration Act restored the \n     broad coverage of the four major civil rights laws that \n     prohibit the federal funding of discrimination against \n     minorities, women, persons with disabilities, and older \n     Americans.\n       The final passage votes on all these laws averaged 85% of \n     both the House and the Senate. In recognition of that \n     extraordinary bipartisan success, Senator Edward Kennedy has \n     called Ralph ``the 101st Senator on Civil Rights.''\n       Ralph also managed the successful campaigns to preserve the \n     Executive Order on Affirmative Action in 1985-1986 and to \n     defeat the Supreme Court nomination of Robert Bork. The Bork \n     campaign was perhaps the most forceful statement of the \n     determination of the coalition that the civil rights gains of \n     three decades would not be rolled back.\n       Other LCCR legislative priorities enacted into law over the \n     past fourteen years include the Family & Medical Leave Act, \n     the Motor Voter Bill, the South African Sanctions \n     Legislation, the Religious Freedom Restoration Act, the \n     Voting Rights Language Assistance Act of 1982, the Elementary \n     and Secondary Education Act of 1994 (including Chapter One \n     reform), the Martin Luther King Holiday Act, three disability \n     measures which overturned Supreme Court decisions, the Age \n     [[Page S6030]] Discrimination in Employment Claims Assistance \n     Act, the Gender Equity in Education Act, the Voting \n     Accessibility for Disabled and Senior Citizens Act, the 1989 \n     Minimum Wage Increase, the Hate Crimes Statistics Act, and \n     key provisions of the Economic Equity Act.\n       Without question, the past decade and a half has been, \n     legislatively, a bipartisan reaffirmation of civil rights \n     laws and a bipartisan repudiation of the right-wing legal \n     philosophy. Indeed, the right wing did not enact one major \n     item on its regressive civil rights agenda during that time. \n     The LCCR victories are even more remarkable when\n      one considers that during this time two branches of \n     government were hostile to civil rights.\n       While the civil rights coalition and its congressional \n     allies achieved considerable success, there was a serious \n     downside to the Reagan-Bush years. We had to refight the \n     civil rights battles that had been won during the 1960's and \n     the 1970's. While these battles were won once again, \n     Congress, the civil rights community, and the Nation had to \n     devote an inordinate amount of time, energy and resources in \n     waging these rearguard actions. Consequently, while the legal \n     achievements of the past 30 years were preserved and in a \n     number of instances, strengthened, the Nation by and large \n     was unable to address the unfinished agenda of the civil \n     rights movement--the quest for social and economic justice.\n       For years, Ralph and his LCCR colleagues have been \n     advocating that economic justice must be the civil rights \n     coalition's top priority. Our legislative efforts should \n     focus primarily on such issues as health care; affordable \n     housing; economic security, especially for women and \n     children; child care; Head Start and other early educational \n     opportunities; employment opportunity, including job creation \n     and job training; and economic empowerment issues. \n     Regrettably, just as this economic opportunity agenda seemed \n     to be moving to the front of the legislative line, once again \n     we may have to devote our energies to resisting efforts to \n     dismantle the legislative achievements of the past several \n     decades.\n       While the battles will be hard fought, I remain confident \n     that LCCR and its allies will once again defeat the efforts \n     of the right wing, whether the issue be affirmative action or \n     the economic security net for millions of Americans. Indeed, \n     the same type of bipartisanship, creativity, and pragmatism \n     that characterized our efforts in the 1980's and early 1990's \n     will lead us to victory in the last half of the 1990's.\n\n\n    the explosive institutional growth of the leadership conference\n\n       While the legislative successes are critically important, \n     it is also important to point out the institutional successes \n     as well. The fourteen years Ralph has spent managing LCCR \n     have been characterized by explosive growth. The budget of \n     the Leadership Conference has grown seven-fold since 1981. \n     And the Leadership Conference, always the Nation's largest \n     coalition, has added more than 50 new national organizations, \n     during this time. Some of the new members are the American \n     Association of Retired Persons (AARP), the Association of \n     Junior Leagues, the Disability Rights Education and Defense \n     Fund, the American Association of University Women, the \n     Mexican American Legal Defense and Education Fund, the \n     Service Employees International Union, the Congress of \n     National Black Churches, the American Nurses Association, the \n     Puerto Rican Legal Defense and Education Fund, Families USA, \n     the National PTA, People For The American Way, the United\n      Brotherhood of Carpenters and Joiners of America, the Human \n     Rights Campaign Fund, Citizen Action, and the National \n     Asian Pacific American Legal Consortium. There are now 180 \n     national organizations, with memberships totaling more \n     than 50 million Americans, who belong to the Leadership \n     Conference on Civil Rights.\n       Such institutional growth has meant also the expansion of \n     LCCR priorities. In addition to minority, gender, religious, \n     and age issues, the Leadership Conference has forged a \n     consensus on disability and gay and lesbian civil rights \n     issues. The exceptional growth of the coalition, while \n     generating new challenges, has made the Leadership Conference \n     stronger and even more effective.\n       Throughout the years, Ralph has masterfully maintained \n     unity among the diverse elements of the LCCR coalition. And \n     through his work in LCCR, on Capitol Hill, with the Executive \n     Branch, and with the business community, Ralph has earned \n     respect for his ability to build bridges between disparate \n     communities of interest and across the spectrum of political \n     ideologies.\n       Ralph has also managed the Leadership Conference Education \n     Fund (LCEF), an independent organization that supports \n     educational activities relevant to civil rights. Along with \n     Karen McGill Arrington, LCEF's Deputy Director, he has \n     supervised projects such as an award winning public service \n     advertising campaign promoting tolerance and diversity; a \n     children's anti-discrimination campaign; and the publication \n     of books and reports on emerging civil rights issues.\n\n\n                           ralph's new career\n\n       To say the least, things have not slowed down during \n     Ralph's final months as LCCR's Executive Director. He was a \n     key strategist in the successful effort to defeat the \n     Balanced Budget Constitutional Amendment. Presently, he is \n     coordinating the campaign to save affirmative action. In \n     addition, Ralph is lecturing one day per week on the \n     legislative process at the University of Chicago Law School.\n       In May, Ralph will embark on a new phase of his \n     professional life. He will join the Washington law firm of \n     Fox, Bennett, and Turner, where he will be Of Counsel. At the \n     law firm, he will set up an affiliate, The Neas Group, which \n     will provide strategic counseling to business and non-profit \n     institutions. In addition, Ralph will be a Visiting Professor \n     on a part-time basis at the Georgetown University Law Center \n     where he will teach courses on the legislative process.\n       Among the boards on which he will continue to serve are the \n     Guillain-Barre Syndrome Foundation International, the \n     Disability Rights Education and Defense Fund, and the \n     Children's Charities Foundation.\n       On behalf of everyone in the Leadership Conference, I want \n     to express our deepest gratitude to Ralph and wish him well \n     in all his new endeavors. We will miss the personal qualities \n     that made Ralph so effective in his job--his cheerfulness and \n     optimism even when facing great challenges, his patience in \n     working with people to resolve differences within the \n     coalition, and the respect he accorded to everyone's point of \n     view. But we know that there will be many opportunities to \n     work with him as we confront the challenges ahead of us. \n     There is no question in my mind that Ralph will continue to \n     be one of the drum majors for justice.\n     \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/05/03/senate-section/article/S6028-1", "month": "05", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "03", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6030-S6031]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n               TRIBUTE TO FORMER SENATOR JOHN C. STENNIS\n\n  Mr. HEFLIN. Mr. President, I would like to add my voice to those \nwhich have already lamented the passing of our dear former colleague \nfrom Mississippi, John Stennis. About 25 of us went down to Mississippi \nlast week to his funeral to say goodbye to one of the true giants in \nthe history of this institution.\n  I recall about 10 years ago, some Senators, including myself, went to \nSenator Stennis' hometown of De Kalb, MS, where the people of De Kalb \nand surrounding areas had gathered to help celebrate his birthday. \nThere was a great outpouring of love and genuine affection from friends \nand neighbors who had known him, his father, and others before him. No \none really knows an individual in the same way that the people of his \nhometown do, and you could see that as they came together that day. \nThere was an authentic feeling of closeness and friendship.\n  De Kalb is a small community, probably smaller than the one I come \nfrom. The people there--the salt of the earth--knew their favorite son, \nJohn Stennis, for his character and integrity. The great outpouring of \naffection which was on display that day was the best evidence anyone \never needed of his graciousness, honesty, decency, and dedication to \nprinciple. All of us there could see that he stood very tall with those \nwho knew him best.\n  John Stennis and I had much in common, both of us from southern \nfamilies that go back for many generations. I used to enjoy the stories \nhe would tell about his early years and how his father would raise \ncotton, transport it over to Alabama, and ship it down the river to \nMobile. We were both judges at one time, which gave us a unique \nperspective on government, individuals, and human nature in general.\n  John Cornelius Stennis was born on August 3, 1901, in Kemper County, \nin the red clay hills of eastern Mississippi. He graduated Phi Beta \nKappa from what is now Mississippi State University in 1923 and 4 years \nlater, received his law degree from the University of Virginia. Just 1 \nyear later, he was elected to the Mississippi Legislature. He later \nwent on to serve as a district prosecuting attorney and circuit judge.\n  After 10 years on the bench, he ran in 1947 for the Senate seat held \nby the flamboyant Senator Theodore G. Bilbo and was elected over five \nopponents in November. His campaign theme was ``I want to plow a \nstraight furrow right down to the end of my row,'' and that philosophy \nguided the rest of his career in public service.\n  Until his last campaign, in 1982, he was never seriously challenged \nfor reelection. Even then, facing future Republican National Committee \nChairman Haley Barbour, then only 34, he won by\n a 2-to-1 margin.\n\n  In his early days in the Senate, John would work 16 hours a day, \nstaying in the Senate until it adjourned and then studying in the \nLibrary of Congress. He was meticulous in his work, someone who would \ngo over something again and again until he finally mastered its \ncomplexities. He was a commanding \n[[Page S6031]] presence in the Senate Chamber, where his voice carried \nsuch resonance. Even after we had microphones, he would often speak \nwithout one.\n  John Stennis served in the Senate longer than all but one other \nperson in its history. When he retired on January 3, 1989, he had \nserved for 41 years, 1 month, and 29 days. During the 1960's and \n1970's, he was the most influential voice in Congress on military \naffairs. He was chairman of the appropriations Committee, and was \ninstrumental in the development of the Tennessee-Tombigbee Waterway, \nwhich was extremely important to both our States economically. He \nchanged with the times, and began to support civil rights measures. Due \nto his integrity, diligence, and judgment, he was often called upon to \ninvestigate controversial political matters. It became routine to refer \nto him as the conscience of the Senate. He was a patriarch and teacher \nto younger Members.\n  It his later years, while his voice remained clear and his mind \nsharp, he experienced serious physical problems. He was shot and \nseriously wounded by a burglar at his home in 1973, and had a leg \namputated in 1984 due to cancer, but each time, he returned to his \nbeloved Senate much sooner than had been expected.\n  After he retired, Senator Stennis moved to the Mississippi State \nUniversity campus, home of the John C. Stennis Institute of Government \nand the John C. Stennis Center for Public Service, created by Congress \nto train young leaders. In one of his last interviews, he said, ``I do \nbelieve the most important thing I can do now is to help young people \nunderstand the past and prepare for the future.''\n  At that birthday celebration for John Stennis a decade ago, I had the \nhonor and pleasure of speaking. I ended my speech with an old Irish \nprayer, which goes:\n\n     May the road rise to meet you.\n     May the wind always be at your back.\n     May the Sun shine warm on your face\n     And the rains fall soft on your shoulders,\n     And may the Good Lord hold you in the\n       hollow of his hand during the remainder of\n       your days.\n\n  He was a deeply religious man, and he told me he was particularly \nglad I used the prayer as a closing on that occasion.\n  John Stennis' days are now over, and his passing gives us reason to \npause, reflect, and remember that this body is a decidedly better \ninstitution, and the United States a better nation, for having had the \nbenefit of this statesman's service for so many years.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/05/03/senate-section/article/S6030-1", "month": "05", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "03", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6031]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO BURTON COHEN\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, it is a personal privilege for me to rise \ntoday to congratulate a man of considerable achievement in both \nbusiness and community spirit. Burton Cohen was one of the pioneers who \nhelped lead Las Vegas from its origins as a small gaming community to \nthe thriving resort city that it has become today. Despite the great \ndemands of his career, he has always devoted great time and energy to \nthe development of our community and our State. Burton Cohen is more \nthan a close friend; he is also a role model for Nevadans and all \ncitizens of our country.\n  Burton Cohen moved to southern Nevada in 1966 when he became part \nowner and managing director of the Frontier Hotel. He had previously \nrisen to success as the owner of his own hotel development company in \nFlorida.\n  His talents were soon recognized throughout the Nevada gaming \ncommunity, and he was recruited for other leadership positions in Las \nVegas at Circus Circus, the Flamingo Hilton, Caesar's Palace, and the \nDunes Hotel.\n  In addition to his considerable contributions to various hotel \nproperties throughout southern Nevada, Burton has been a pivotal factor \nin shaping Nevada's transition to the 21st century. He was president of \nthe Nevada Resort Association and was on the influential board of the \nLas Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority. Without his innovative \npresence, and his insightful vision, Las Vegas would not be the \ndestination resort and convention center it is today.\n  Mr. Cohen has always adhered to the needs of our community. He became \nclosely involved in numerous community activities and charitable \ncauses. He served on the board of the Southern Nevada Drug Abuse \nCouncil and led a successful campaign for the United Way in the Las \nVegas Valley. Burton was a member of the board of directors of the \nBoys' Clubs of Clark County and the Nevada Division of American Cancer \nSociety. Furthermore, he has also been an active member in the Anti-\nDefamation League and is currently a trustee of Sunrise Hospital in Las \nVegas.\n  Burton Cohen recently announced his retirement from his current \nposition as president and chief executive officer of the Desert Inn \nHotel and Country Club. His accomplishments in hotel management and in \nthe community are unrivaled and will be deeply missed. Along with his \nwife, Linda, Burton has made southern Nevada a better place for \ntourists and residents alike.\n  On Saturday, May 20, the Anti-Defamation League will be honoring \nBurton Cohen with the ``Lifetime Achievement Award.'' I can think of no \nbetter recipient for this honor, and I want the entire country to know \nof Burton's achievements and to join those of us in Nevada in \nrecognizing his commitment to excellence.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/05/03/senate-section/article/S6031-1", "month": "05", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "03", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6031-S6032]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                            MR. MAX H. KARL\n\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I rise today to express my sorrow at the \npassing of my good friend, Max H. Karl. He died on April 19, at the age \nof 85. Max was a man of vision, intellect, action, and compassion. He \nlived life to its fullest extent as a family man, a business man, a \nphilanthropist, a civic minded citizen, and as a man devoted to his \nfaith. Max Karl was a good friend not only to myself and my family, but \nto all of those who had the good fortune to come into contact with him.\n  At this time, I also extend my heartfelt condolences to his family. \nMax is survived by his wife Anita, his son Dr. Robert Karl of Miami, \ndaughter Karyn Schwade of Miami, sister Minnie Friedman of Milwaukee, \nhis brother Dr. Michael Karl of St. Louis, and nine grandchildren.\n  Mr. President, Max Karl was a man who was devoted to his family, his \ncommunity and his work. He was a son of Wisconsin, who in every way \ncontributed to the betterment of those around him. Max was a graduate \nof the University of Wisconsin and its law school. He was the founder \nand chairman of the Mortgage Guaranty Insurance Corp., headquartered in \nmy hometown of Milwaukee. Max also served as past president of the \nMortgage Insurance Companies of America and as a director of First \nWisconsin Corp. and MGIC affiliates.\n  In the public arena, Max served as a member of the Federal Home Loan \nMortgage Corporation's advisory committee; the Metropolitan Milwaukee \nAssociation Chamber of Commerce; the National Association of Home \nBuilders Roundtable; and was a member of the University of Wisconsin-\nMilwaukee's School of Business Administration Advisory Council.\n  Max Karl's other civic activities included serving as a director of \nthe Grand Avenue Corp.; the Greater Milwaukee Committee; the Milwaukee \nArt Museum; the Milwaukee Symphony Orchestra; and the United Performing \nArts Fund. Max was also a past trustee of Mt. Sinai Medical Center; \nAlverno College; the National Multiple Sclerosis Society; and a trustee \nemeritus of Marquette University.\n  Among the many awards and commendations he received in recognition of \nhis charitable and civic work, Max was the 1962 recipient of the \nNational Home and House Award; the 1973 recipient of the State of \nIsrael Golda Meir Award; the 1982 Milwaukee Press Club Headliner Award \nwinner; the 1985 Children's Outing Association Father of the Year; and \nmost recently, in 1994, Max Karl was named to the UWM School of \nBusiness Administration ``Wisconsin Gallery'' of leading corporate \ncitizens.\n  Max Karl was also a giant in the Milwaukee Jewish Community who, \namong his other accomplishments, served as a past president of the \nMilwaukee Jewish Federation; a former chairman of Wisconsin State of \nIsrael Bonds; a member of the boards of Hillel Academy and the former \nMilwaukee Jewish Home.

Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to Ralph \nNeas, an outstanding leader for civil rights, who is being honored this \nevening by the Leadership Conference on Civil Rights.\n  Tonight, as the Leadership Conference on Civil Rights [LCCR] \ncelebrates its 45th anniversary as the Nation's oldest, largest and \nmost broadly based civil rights coalition, Ralph Neas will be awarded \nthe prestigious Hubert H. Humphrey Civil Rights Award for his \n``selfless and devoted service in the cause of equality.'' During his \n14-year tenure as the executive director of the Leadership Conference, \nRalph has been a voice of compassion and reason and a tireless advocate \nfor equality. Dubbed the ``101st Senator on Civil Rights'' by Senator \nEdward Kennedy, for his successful coordination of the lobbying efforts \nof 180 national organizations in the LCCR and for playing a major role \nin the passage of more than two dozen legislative victories, Ralph has \ndemonstrated his effectiveness as a coalition builder. From the \nenactment of the 1982 Voting Rights Act extension to the recent \nenactment of the Civil Rights Act of 1991, his efforts have truly made \na difference with respect to securing civil rights for millions of \nAmericans.\n  Ralph's role in the civil rights community has not been limited to \nadvocacy for the legislative arm of the civil rights community. In \naddition to his lobbying and legal research efforts, Ralph took on the \nrole of executive director of the Leadership Conference Educational \nFund. This independent organization supports numerous educational \nactivities relevant to civil rights such as: an award winning public \nservice advertising campaign promoting tolerance and diversity; a \nchildren's anti-discrimination campaign; and the publication of books \nand reports on emerging civil rights issues.\n  Today, when our country is increasingly a mixture of races, languages \nand religions, I am delighted to pay tribute to the efforts of an \nindividual who recognizes the importance of both preserving and \ncelebrating the diversity of our society. The reality is that America \nis essentially a pair of ideals--liberty and equality. However, these \nare ideals that are still unrealized. To realize these ideals we need \nto recognize that our increasing ethnic and racial diversity is a \nremarkable opportunity. We need to recognize that we will either all \nadvance together, or each of us will be diminished. Ralph Neas has \nspent the better part of a distinguished career working to ensure \nthat--no matter the color of our skin, the shape of our eyes, our \nreligion, our gender--we all advance together. I salute Ralph Neas for \nthe dedication and leadership he has so generously given to the civil \nrights community and congratulate him on being awarded the Hubert H. \nHumphrey Civil Rights Award.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/05/03/senate-section/article/S6032-1", "month": "05", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "03", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6032]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n          WAS CONGRESS IRRESPONSIBLE?

Mr. President, it is a privilege to take this \nopportunity to commend Tufts University in Medford, MA, which 2 weeks \nago celebrated its 11th annual Tuftonia's Week events. During this week \neach year, graduates of Tufts from around the world join together to \nremember and honor their outstanding university.\n  Tufts was founded in 1852 and now has over 8,000 students from all 50 \nStates and 213 foreign countries. The university's main campus in \nMedford/Somerville is home to the college of liberal arts, the graduate \nschool, the school of nutrition, and the Fletcher School of Law and \nDiplomacy, among others. The school of medicine and dentistry is on the \nBoston campus, and the Grafton campus houses the only school of \nveterinary medicine in New England.\n  I am proud to note that this year, the theme of Tuftonia's Week is \ncommunity service. Many alumni celebrated the occasion by volunteering \nand helping to improve life in their neighborhoods. Among universities \nin Massachusetts, Tufts has taken an impressive leadership role in \npromoting community service and by integrating opportunities for such \nservice into the academic curriculum.\n  The Tuftonia's Week celebration has a special meaning for me, because \nmy daughter is one of more than 85,000 Tufts graduates. I am honored to \ntake this opportunity to congratulate the president, John DiBiaggio, \nand the rest of the Tufts community for their impressive \naccomplishments.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/05/03/senate-section/article/S6032-3", "month": "05", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "03", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6032-S6033]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                  A GREAT PHYSICIAN AND A TRUE PIONEER\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to Ray \nStowers, D.O., a constituent of mine. Dr. Stowers, a native Oklahoman, \nis an osteopathic, family practice physician from Medford, OK, who is a \ntrue example of the pioneer spirit in America.\n  In the pioneer spirit, Ray's contributions have resulted in so many \n``firsts'' in his life, both for the State of Oklahoma, for the \nosteopathic medical profession, and for the patients that he has \nreached into the rural communities to help.\n  It is because of his most recent ``first'', that I rise today to \ncongratulate Ray on his recent appointment to the Physician Payment \nReview Commission [PPRC]. Ray Stowers represents what is best about \nmedicine and physicians in America today. During a time when the trend \nto become a specializing physician is so strong and promises such great \nrewards, Ray Stowers has remained dedicated to the path of providing \nsolo, rural, family medicine for 21 years. Yet from this path, Ray has \nbeen able to pioneer programs that enhance the numbers of physicians \nwho share this important commitment.\n  One of Ray's many successes occurred when the Governor of Oklahoma \nappointed him to serve on the board of the Task Force and Rural \nPlanning Committee which was responsible for advising the Governor on \nthe State's health care manpower needs, and for convening a statewide \nconference to discuss rural health care delivery issues.\n  As well, Ray had the vision to see Oklahoma's need for rural health \nclinics, ensuring care for Oklahoma's hardest to reach populations. \nWhile he saw the need for, and began, the first rural health clinics in \nthis State, within 5 years that number had burgeoned into 38 rural \nhealth clinics. Now, Oklahoma's hard-to-reach and underserved \ncommunities are assured access to a doctor and good medical care.\n  In addition to his many appointments, since 1993, Dr. Stowers also \nhas been a presence on the American Medical Association Relative Value \nUpdate Committee [RUC]. As the first osteopathic physician appointed to \nserve on this prestigious committee, Ray has facilitated greater \nunderstanding, collaboration, and teamwork between the osteopathic \nmedical profession and the allopathic physician community, and has lent \nhis considerable expertise on physician practices to the RUC \nproceedings.\n  Dr. Stowers has served his family, his profession, his community, and \nhis State with strength and integrity that symbolizes a modern pioneer. \nDr. Stowers, the great State of Oklahoma is proud of your \naccomplishments. And \n[[Page S6033]] I am honored to join your family and friends and \ncolleagues in wishing you every success as you embark on your next \njourney; serving on the Physician Payment Review Commission.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/05/03/senate-section/article/S6032-4", "month": "05", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "03", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6033]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I add my voice of concern over the delay \nin action of the Federal budget. It is now May 3. That is over a month \nafter the April 1 deadline for the Budget Committee to report a \nconcurrent resolution on the budget. It is also nearly 3 weeks after \nthe April 15 deadline for Congress to have completed its work on that \nconcurrent budget resolution.\n  I raise my concern, Mr. President, knowing that not every budget \ndeadline has always been met, nor do I suggest that the task facing the \nBudget Committee is an easy one. It is a very tough one. But by this \ntime, during the two sessions of the 103d Congress, we had considered \nand passed a concurrent budget resolution through the Senate.\n  In 1994, we passed the Senate version of the concurrent budget \nresolution on March 25, and agreed to a conference report on May 12.\n  Moreover, those concurrent budget resolutions contained politically \ntough deficit reduction provisions, and were submitted, debated, and \npassed at a time when a new administration was taking office--the first \nPresidential party change in 12 years.\n  Mr. President, many of us on this side of the aisle are ready to help \ncraft a budget that will eliminate the Federal deficit.\n  We have demonstrated that we are willing to vote for politically \nunpopular proposals to lower the deficit.\n  In 1993, when we were the majority party, we developed and passed a \n$500 billion deficit reduction package.\n  We are still very sorry that no member of what was then the minority \nparty decided to support that package, though it was certainly the \nright of each Senator to vote as they saw fit.\n  Beyond the individual right of minority members, though, during the \n103d Congress it was our responsibility as the majority party to \nadvance a budget, not the responsibility of those on the other side of \nthe aisle who were in the minority at the time.\n  Mr. President, it is the responsibility of the majority party to \npropose, refine, and pass a budget, with or without the help of members \nof the minority. We want to be a part of that process and to cooperate. \nBut it is first the responsibility of the majority.\n  It is the privilege of the minority party to respond, offer \nalternatives, and, when conscience requires, to dissent from the budget \nproposal.\n  Such is the political dynamic of our legislative process.\n  And our colleagues on the other side of the aisle exercised their \nprivilege as the minority party in 1993, and refused to join us in \nmaking that tough deficit reduction vote.\n  Mr. President, the two parties have exchanges roles in the 104th \nCongress, but the duty of the majority party remains unchanged.\n  It is the majority party that\n   sets the agenda, proposes a budget, and finds a way to pass that \nbudget.\n\n  By contrast to the last Congress, however, I know a number of us in \nthe minority are willing to support a budget resolution that reduces \nthe deficit.\n  We will help shoulder the burden of passing a budget that reduces the \ndeficit.\n  But, Mr. President, before we can provide that cooperation, we must \nhave a budget to work with.\n  The choices that face us are already extremely difficult.\n  Each day we delay they become even harder.\n  We are all very much aware of how our budget problems are \naccelerating, and what delay means in lost fiscal opportunities.\n  But delay also risks the political consensus that must be achieved if \nwe are to make significant progress on the deficit.\n  Mr. President, without public support, we cannot hope to find the \nvotes for a balanced budget.\n  I don't mean to suggest that we can only pass a budget if the \nAmerican people are enthusiastically behind every provision.\n  That is not going to happen when doing spending cuts.\n  If we could find such a proposal, we would have balanced the budget a \nlong time ago.\n  Nor do the American people expect or even want such a budget.\n  They rightly are skeptical of those who promise easy solutions.\n  Mr. President, what the American people do want is to feel that their \nelected Representatives are being straightforward and open with them \nabout what they propose.\n  They will not support a budget that is the product of closed-door \nmeetings, held in the dead of night.\n  But they will support a budget that is openly debated.\n  They are willing to sacrifice if they feel that the process has been \nopen and fair.\n  Mr. President, this budget delay really amounts to a budget blackout.\n  The longer the delay, the longer the blackout, and the less likely \nthat we will be able to build the political consensus with the American \npublic that we will need to balance the budget.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/05/03/senate-section/article/S6033-3", "month": "05", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "03", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6033-S6068]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n          COMMONSENSE PRODUCT LIABIL- ITY AND LEGAL REFORM ACT\n\n  The Senate continued with the consideration of the bill.\n  Mr. HEFLIN addressed the chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. HEFLIN. Mr. President, I would like to address the Dole amendment \nand its relationship to other parts of the bill.\n  The Dole amendment, of course, extends the provisions of this \nproposed bill to all civil actions involving interstate commerce. That \nincludes almost every automobile accident, and every conceivable type \nof accident, not just product liability cases. And, as we know, the \nlanguage ``interstate commerce'' has been so liberally construed up \nuntil the very recent Lopez case that it includes almost any situation. \nThere are many examples, too numerous to cite here, that can \ndemonstrate the liberal construction of the interstate commerce clause.\n  Let me first recite the provision not only in the Dole amendment but \nin the overall bill pertaining to punitive damages, that if you seek \npunitive damages and any party can call for a bifurcated trial which \nmeans that at the request \n[[Page S6034]] of any party, the trier of facts, the jury, shall \nconsider in a separate proceeding as to whether punitive damages should \nbe awarded. By the way, bifurcated proceedings will result in an \nincrease in transitional costs which is somewhat ironic in as much as \nthe proponents of this legislation have maintained that one of the \nbill's objectives is to reduce, not increase, transactional costs.\n  If there is evidence of punitive misconduct, it is inconceivable to \nme that any defendant would not take advantage of a bifurcated trial. \nSo, all punitive damage cases will have two trials. In the first trial, \nwhich is the trial in regard to underlying liability, compensatory \ndamages will be sought, which includes noneconomic damages and economic \ndamages, and all of its component aspects. There is this provision in \nthe Dole amendment, and also in the overall bill--it is just a \nrepetition put here--that evidence relative only to the claim of \npunitive damages as determined by applicable State law shall be \ninadmissible--not admissible, but inadmissible--in any proceedings to \ndetermine whether compensatory damages are to be awarded.\n  That means that in an automobile accident case or in a truck/\nautomobile case, you could prove negligence in the trial in chief, but \nyou could not prove gross negligence. Basically, what that means--and \nevery defendant who would come along would argue--yes, you can argue \nthat the truck that caused the accident, that did the wrongdoing, \ncrossed the center line and hit an individual. But you could not prove \nthat the driver had three beers or had a pint of whiskey, because that \nissue would go to the punitive damage aspect of the case. You could not \nprove basically that the owner of the truck knew, under these \ncircumstances, that that driver had been convicted four times before of \ndrunk driving. You could not prove in the trial in chief that the \ndriver of that motor vehicle--and it was known to the owner of the \ntruck, the truck company, that defendant had been convicted twice of \nreckless driving. You could not go into any aspect that would be \nevidence relating punitive damages and punitive misconduct.\n  Now, you could not prove in the Pinto automobile cases that there was \na memorandum to the effect that a company will come out financially \nbetter rather than having a recall because of the location of the fuel \ntank and the certain danger that would result in the case of a rear end \ncollisions. The memorandum in question showed that the company would \ncome out better financially and with less expense to just pay off the \nclaims that might arise from rear end collisions.\n  Now, how does this relate also to the Snowe amendment which is in the \nDole amendment? We have to go in and look to several liability for \nnoneconomic loss. Under the Snowe cap, the cap on punitive damages is \ntwice the amount of economic and noneconomic damages.\n  Section 109 of the bill on the matter of several liability reads\n\n       Each defendant shall be liable only for the amount of \n     noneconomic loss allocated to the defendant in direct \n     proportion to the percentage of responsibility of the \n     defendant determined in accordance to the harm to the \n     plaintiff with respect to which the defendant is liable.\n\n  Therefore, in a motor truck and automobile accident, if a person were \nsuing for punitive damages in a particularly egregious situation and \ntrying to prove noneconomic damages, such as pain and the suffering, \nfor example, and being aware of the basis for the cap of the Snowe \namendment, that person could not prove against the owner of the truck \nthat the owner knew of four convictions of drunk driving and two \nconvictions of reckless driving in his efforts to establish the several \nliability of the driver and the owner of the truck.\n  How can a person establish under not only the Dole amendment but \nunder the bill as a whole the amount of noneconomic damage, for \nexample, against the owner of the truck?\n  Now, that is just one example, and there are probably a multitude of \nother examples. There are other aspects, but these two relate together \nin that, together, they put an injured party at a terrible \ndisadvantage. It in effect says, regardless of the injury or the human \nelement in this, we are interested in profits.\n  To me, as I look at all of this, and every time I see more and more \ninstances which raise serious questions in my mind, there are all sort \nof provisions throughout this particular bill that just really shock \nthe conscience as regards to the issue of fairness.\n  I am deeply concerned that people do not really understand how the \nprovisions interrelate and what ultimate impact the bill will have on \nthe individual and his or her rights to seek fair redress for injuries \nhe or she may have received.\n  How much time is remaining on our side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Sixteen minutes.\n  Mr. HEFLIN. I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, how much time does the Senator desire?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, 7 or 8 minutes.\n  Mr. GORTON. I yield 8 minutes to the Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, the amendment I offered yesterday to \nbroaden this bill to include medical malpractice reform, which the \nSenate approved, may have been the shot heard around the civil justice \nsystem, but the amendment we will be voting on offered by Senator Dole \nto extend punitive damages reform to all civil cases in the country is \nreally the beginning of the revolution.\n  The Dole punitive damages amendment, together with an Abraham- \nMcConnell amendment on joint and several liability, which we will offer \nshortly, are the true tests of whether the Senate is going to provide \nmeaningful and comprehensive civil justice reform for every American.\n  Let me explain why the Dole amendment is so important to restoring \njustice to our civil justice system. Economic and noneconomic damages \nare awarded to compensate an injured party, to make the person whole in \nevery possible way. That is a fundamental purpose of civil liability \nand one which I strongly support.\n  Punitive damages, on the other hand, are assessed to punish the \nresponsible party for conduct that is almost criminal in its \nrecklessness, deliberateness, or malice. Since we assign liability for \neconomic and noneconomic damage on the basis of fault, it is clear that \npunitive damages are meant to punish something much more than mere \nnegligent conduct. Such damages are to be sought in extreme and unusual \nsituations, not as a bonus, in every case, Mr. President.\n  However, as any students of the tort system can say, the distinction \nbetween the two types of civil damages have become seriously blurred, \nmaking a mockery of the different purposes these damages are meant to \nserve.\n  Claims and large awards for punitive damages have become routine. \nPlaintiffs who are fully compensated for their injuries throughout \neconomic and noneconomic damages get an extra windfall that bears no \nrelation whatever to the harm that they have suffered.\n  The lawyers who represent these plaintiffs are stuffing their pockets \nwith the money, as many plaintiffs lawyers will take up to half and \neven more of the total amount of these lucrative damage awards.\n  Often, Mr. President, the potential for such enormous punitive \ndamages awards entices people to sue in the first place. Plaintiffs, \negged on by their lawyers, will sometimes turn down offers to \ncompensate all their harm in the hope of scoring big with punitive \ndamages or extorting a much larger settlement out of a defendant, who \nis understandably reluctant to play punitives roulette.\n  In other words, what was once intended as a very narrow remedy lying \nsomewhere between civil and criminal law has now become a gold mine \nthat is exploited without regard to the considerations of justice and \ndue process. The Dole amendment is designed to restore the concept of \npunishment to punitive damages.\n  If we accept the principle that the law of punitive damages must be \nreformed in product liability and medical malpractice, it follows that \nsuch reform should be extended to other civil actions as well.\n  Punitive damage reform will not limit an injured party's right to be \n[[Page S6035]] fully compensated for any harm. Instead, it will give \nrelief to consumers in the form of lower prices at the checkout counter \nand lower insurance costs for their homes and businesses. To confine \nthat relief to product liability and medical malpractice gets only part \nof the job done.\n  Now, who is hurt by excessive punitive damages awards? The list is \nalmost endless. Cities, counties, park districts, nonprofit agencies, \ncharities like the Girl Scouts and the Little League and small \nbusinesses.\n  For example, the Girl Scouts in Washington have to sell 87,000 boxes \nof Girl Scouts cookies just to pay their liability insurance premium. \nIn southern Illinois, they must sell 41,000 boxes to cover insurance \nliability. Girl Scout camps can no longer afford to offer horseback \nriding because of excessive risk. They have no diving boards in the \nswimming pools--too much exposure to litigation.\n  Cities spend $9 billion on liability judgments and settlements every \nyear. An employee of the Smithsonian won a $400,000 award--$390,000 in \nthe form of punitive damages because his supervisor called him an \nunflattering name. I guess that proves that sticks and stones may break \nmy bones, while names earn a lawsuit.\n  For small businesses, one lawsuit can mean bankruptcy, even if it is \nwon. The huge fee and time spent away from the businesses has literally \nwiped out mom and mop enterprises despite the fact that they win the \nsuit. No wonder so many small businesses cave in to legal extortion \nrather than risk court costs, legal fees, disruption of the business, \nharm to their reputation, and exposure to the most expensive lottery in \nAmerica--punitive damages.\n  The National Federation of Independent Business, which has been one \nof the true heroes on civil justice reform, brought to my attention the \ncase of Hunt Tractor in my home State of Kentucky. They have been sued \nin two cases involving product liability allegations. In one case, the \nequipment operator was obviously negligent; and in the other case, the \nowner had modified the equipment to make it unsafe.\n  While Hunt won both cases, it cost the company and its insurance \ncarrier more than $100,000 to defend, and countless hours entangled in \nlegal proceedings.\n  Domino's, the chain of pizza delivery restaurants, was found liable \nfor the injuries of a woman harmed when one of its pizza trucks was \nrushing to meet Domino's promised 30-minute-delivery deadline. \nRegardless of whether you believe Domino's had some share of the \nresponsibility, the damages awarded in the case were astonishing. Out \nof a total award of $79 million, close to $78 million was punitive \ndamages.\n  Some of my colleagues have mentioned the situation in Alabama, a \nState I have a great deal of interest in. I was born there and lived \nthe first 8 years of my life in Alabama. In Alabama, plaintiffs \nroutinely recover punitive damage awards. In three counties studied by \nProf. George Priest, of the Yale Law School, he found that punitive \ndamages were\n awarded in 72 to 95 percent of all cases in these three counties in \nAlabama--all cases.\n\n  It is hard to imagine that in all these cases defendants have behaved \nso egregiously as to warrant an assessment of punitive damages. \nClearly, we need to bring punitive damages under control and relate \nthem to punishment--not another routine part of every case. That is \nwhat this debate is about. It is not, as the opponents of reform have \nclaimed, about taking money away from victims. It is about bringing \nsome certainty to civil punishment, just as we do for criminal \ndefendants.\n  I thank the Chair and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN addressed the Chair.\n  Mr. HEFLIN. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays on the Shelby \namendment.\n  Mr. GORTON. Excuse me, will the Senator withhold?\n  Mr. HEFLIN. All right, I yield to the Senator from Illinois.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois is recognized.\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. Mr. President, I know that I do not have a great \ndeal of time, but I would like to discuss very briefly why I believe it \nwould be a mistake for the Senate to adopt the Dole amendment on \npunitive damages. I know that the sponsors of this amendment are \nconfident that their amendment, as drafted, will ensure that no \nlimitations are placed on the ability to recover punitive damages in \nFederal civil rights cases. I am not sure that I agree with their \nassessment; however, even if it were correct, the pending amendment \nwill have disastrous consequences in numerous cases that are brought \npursuant to State law, including cases to vindicate civil rights. I \nhave here a letter from Morris Dees, chief trial counsel for the \nSouthern Poverty Law Center, which states:\n\n       The Southern Poverty Law Center has used both Federal and \n     State laws to cripple a number of white supremacist and neo-\n     Nazi groups during the past 10 years. If a Senate bill that \n     limits punitive damages is enacted, these judgments would not \n     be possible.\n\n  A description of some of the types of cases that would be impacted by \nthe Dole amendment illustrate the major harm that broadening the \nlimitations of punitive damages to cover all civil litigation would \ncreate.\n  In 1990, the Southern Poverty Law Center won a $12.5 million judgment \nagainst the White Aryan Resistance and its leaders--Tom Metzger and his \nson John--for the beating death of a black student in Portland, OR. Of \nthat award, $2.5 million was for compensatory damages, while the \nremaining $10 million was for punitive damages, a punitive award that \nwas four times the amount of compensatory damages.\n  During the trial for civil damages, it was demonstrated that Mr. \nMetzger and the Ayran Resistance had for years preached that nonwhites \nwere ``God's mistakes,'' and that Jews were the progeny of Satan. Tom \nMetzger and his son, John, sent agents to Portland, OR, to organize the \nEast Side White Pride, a youth division of the Aryan Resistance. At the \norganizational meeting, members were encouraged to commit violent acts \nagainst blacks, a fact that had disastrous consequences for a 28-year-\nold black Ethiopian immigrant named Mulugeta Seraw. While walking home, \nMr. Seraw was attacked with a baseball bat by three skinheads who had \nattended the White Ayran Resistance meeting. Mr. Seraw--who had come to \nAmerica to attend Portland State University, and who shipped money from \nhis part-time job to his family back in Ethiopia--didn't stand a \nchance. He was dead before he ever reached the hospital.\n  Mr. President, I mention this case because it was brought not \npursuant to Federal civil rights laws, but pursuant to a State wrongful \ndeath statute, the very type of civil action that will be impacted by \nthe Dole amendment. And it is not the only lawsuit of its kind that the \nDole amendment would limit.\n  Consider this case: In 1987, a wrongful death claim was brought \nagainst the United Klans of America for the lynching death of 19-year-\nold Michael Donald, a masonry student at Carver State Technical College \nin Alabama. The case resulted in a $7 million judgment against the \nKlan. Again, as this is exactly the type of claim that would be \nimpacted by the Dole amendment, I will briefly describe the facts.\n  While walking home from his sister's house one evening, Michael \nDonald was kidnapped by two Klan members, Henry Hays and James \n``Tiger'' Knowles. After driving to a deserted woods, Michael was \nordered out\n of the car. A newspaper account describes what happens next:\n\n       Henry Hays pulls a knife. Michael Jerks free. He runs. They \n     chase him. He grabs a fallen tree limb. They knock it away. \n     Hays has the noose. They wrestle it over Michael's head. \n     Michael pulls on the rope, running in circles. Knowles holds \n     the other end and beats him, again and again, with the tree \n     limb. Michael collapses. Henry Hays pushes his boot into \n     Michael's face and pulls the rope tight. They drag him \n     through the dirt to the car. They lift him into the trunk. \n     Knowles asks Hays if he thinks Michael is dead. ``I don't \n     know,'' Hays replies, ``but I'm gonna make sure.'' He cuts \n     Michael's throat three times. They drive back to Henry Hays' \n     house and throw one end of the rope over the limb of a \n     Camphor tree across the street. Then they lift Michael by the \n     neck--high enough to swing. From the porch, the rest of the \n     Klansmen can see. As Knowles steps back up to join them, he \n     feels a friendly punch. ``Good job, Tiger.''\n  Mr. President, Tiger Knowles and Henry Hays were convicted of crimes \nfor their role in Michael Donald's brutal death, which some people may \nfeel \n[[Page S6036]] is sufficient punishment. But for civil rights activists \nin the deep South, it was not. They recognized that this behavior was \npart of a pattern and practice of conduct by the Klu Klux Klan, \ndesigned to deprive minorities of their civil rights under law. So \nthese activists sued the Klan, not pursuant to Federal Civil Rights \nLaws, but pursuant to State wrongful Death Statutes.\n       At trial, evidence was presented to show that on the \n     evening of the murder, Tiger Knowles and Henry Hays had been \n     told by their local Klan leader ``get this down: if a black \n     man can kill a white man, a white man should be able to get \n     away with killing a black man * * * .'' The jurors were shown \n     a Klan newspaper, that had a\n      drawing of a black man with a noose around his neck, a \ndrawing that Tiger Knowles testified had influenced his behavior. \nJurors were informed of countless other, similar incidents in which the \nUnited Klan had been involved. And ultimately--and quite wisely, I \nwould assert--they awarded Michael's mother, Beulah Mae Donald, $7 \nmillion.\n\n  Perhaps there are some who feel a lower award would be appropriate in \nthis case. Again, I will quote from a newspaper account which describes \nthat amount of the award:\n\n       The Klan cannot pay. It has nowhere near that kind of \n     money. So, in addition to a quarter of the wages some of the \n     klansmen will earn for the rest of their lives, and in \n     addition to titan Bennie Hays' house and farm, Beulah Mae \n     Donald accepts every penny of the several thousand dollars \n     that the United Klans of America has to its name, and the \n     deed and keys to its national headquarters. She shuts it \n     down.\n\n  Mr. President, I have outlined two examples of punitive damages in \nwrongful death cases, but these are not the only types of State law \ncases that would limited by the Dole amendment. In 1988, the Southern \nPoverty Law Center won $1 million from two Georgia Klan groups who \nattacked marchers celebrating Dr. King's birthday. Or consider a recent \naward of $7 million in punitive damages against a law firm that \ntolerated sexual harassment--a claim that was brought pursuant to \nCalifornia's Fair Housing and Employment Act, not Federal civil rights \nlaw.\n  As I stated at the beginning of debate on this legislation, I hope to \nbe able to vote for cloture on a narrow, moderate product liability \nbill. I support reforms such as a statute of repose, or limitations on \nvicarious liability, or limitations of recovery if drug or alcohol use \ncaused the injury. But I will never support any legislation that would, \nin the guise of civil justice reform, make it more difficult to bring \ncivil rights claims under State law. I would never vote for an \namendment that will restrict the ability of civil rights groups to sue \nthe Klu Klux Klan. I urge my colleagues to reject the Dole amendment, \nand I ask unanimous consent that the text of the letter from the \nSouthern Poverty Law Center, as well as the article describing their \nwork, be printed in the Record following my remarks.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                              The Southern Poverty\n\n\n                                                   Law Center,\n\n                                   Montgomery, AL, April 25, 1995.\n     Senator Tom Daschle,\n     Hart Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Daschle: The Southern Poverty Law Center has \n     used both federal and state tort laws to cripple a number of \n     white supremacist and neo-Nazi groups during the past ten \n     years. If a Senate bill that limits punitive damages is \n     enacted, these judgments would not be possible.\n       In 1987, the Center got a $7 million judgment against the \n     United Klans of America for the lynching death of a black \n     teenager. The judgment bankrupted this violent hate group \n     whose members had previously bombed the Sixteenth Street \n     Baptist Church in Birmingham, Alabama, killing four young \n     girls.\n       In 1990, the Center got a $12.5 million judgment against \n     the White Aryan Resistance and its leader Tom Metzger for the \n     death of a black student in Portland, Oregon, at the hands of \n     Skinheads. Most of the judgment was punitive damages. The \n     group we sued is now virtually out of business.\n       In 1988, the Center got $1 million judgment against two \n     Georgia Klan groups for their assault on a group of marchers \n     celebrating Dr. King's birthday. Almost all of this amount \n     was punitive damages. We bankrupted both groups and took \n     property from several members.\n       We presently have a civil damage suit pending against \n     Rescue America and its Florida leader, John Burt. Our client \n     is the family of slain abortion doctor David Gunn. Without a \n     large punitive damage award, a favorable judgment would not \n     be significant or effective.\n       Senator, this is a bad bill that is being proposed in the \n     frenzy of political change. I urge you to vote against \n     cloture on any bill or amendments that limit the ability of \n     our civil justice system to punish those people and \n     organizations that inflict unspeakable injuries on our \n     friends, neighbors, family members and communities.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                      Morris Dees,\n     Chief Trial Counsel.\n                                                                    ____\n\n          [From the Los Angeles Times magazine, Dec. 3, 1989]\n\n                            The Long Crusade\n\n                         (By Richard E. Meyer)\n\n       When Morris Dees was 4, his daddy gave him his only \n     whipping. He used a belt, and he whipped him all over the \n     barnyard. It was for speaking with disrespect to a black man.\n       It made an impression, but nothing like the impression his \n     daddy left a few years later, when Morris Dees was old enough \n     to tote water. It was summer in Alabama, mercilessly hot. He \n     carried the water in a bucket out to his daddy's workers, \n     hoeing cotton in the fields.\n       One of them was Perry Lee. She was black. She kept a big \n     dip of snuff in her cheek. One day, as Morris Dees handed her \n     the water dipper, his daddy drove up. Perry Lee tucked a \n     finger behind her teeth, flicked out her snuff and took time \n     to drink. Morris Dees' daddy did two things his son never \n     forgot.\n       With Perry Lee's hoe, he kept up her row, so she would not \n     worry about falling behind.\n       Then he took the same dipper and drank.\n       Morris Dees grew up with a golden touch. He sold cotton \n     mulch in high school, birthday cakes in college and mail \n     order books after law school. By the time he was 32, he and a \n     partner had sold the business for $6 million.\n       He lent the touch to raise money for Democratic \n     presidential candidates--and, at the same time, Morris Dees, \n     his daddy's son, put the touch to work for people like Perry \n     Lee. In 1971, he co-founded and funded by directmail appeals \n     the Southern Poverty Law Center in Montgomery, Ala., a \n     nonprofit group of attorneys who use the law like a sword.\n       The law center recently unveiled a civil-rights memorial \n     designed by Maya Lin, creator of the Vietnam Veterans \n     Memorial. But its real importance is its litigation on behalf \n     of the underdog. The center has challenged employment \n     discrimination, hazardous working conditions, denial of \n     voting rights, shoddy education, tax inequities and the death \n     penalty. Its battles against the Ku Klux Klan are legendary--\n     so successful that Morris Dees is a man marked for \n     assassination.\n       He is praised as a courageous klan-buster, but he also gets \n     crticized--even among those who share his goals. His critics \n     say that some racists are toothless and that he busts them to \n     impress the center's donors.\n       Now Morris Dees is coming West--to take on California's own \n     Tom Metzger, of Fallbrook, and his White Aryan Resistance \n     (WAR). Dees has sued Metzger, charging him with inciting neo-\n     Nazi skinheads who killed a black man. He wants the courts to \n     order Metzger and his organization to pay damages to the \n     victim's family. His tactic is to ruin Metzger financially--\n     as he has empires of the klan--and put him out of business.\n       If he succeeds, he will undo one of the most important \n     white supremacists still operating.\n       Morris Seligman Dees, 52, is a soft-spoken man with light \n     blue eyes and sandy hair. He is informal, given to wearing \n     open shirts and loafers with no socks. He is wealthy enough \n     to retire. But he does not.\n       What is it like to do what he does?\n       Why, with the inherent danger, does he keep on doing it?\n       It is spring of 1981, a Wednesday might in Mobile, Ala. Out \n     in the suburbs, members of United Klans of America, the \n     biggest, most secretive and arguably most violent of the Ku \n     Klux Klans, are meeting at Bennie Hays' place. Usually they \n     talk about klan business in Bennie's barn, then watch TV over \n     at his house. But by most accounts--testified to, published \n     or simply told--their meeting this night marks the beginnings \n     of something that becomes extraordinary.\n       They are preoccupied by what they consider an outrage. A \n     white policeman has been killed in Birmingham, 85 miles from \n     Montgomery. A black has been charged with the murder. And it \n     looks like the jury is deadlocked. Bennie Hays, 64, titan in \n     charge of Klavern 900, commands everyone's attention. \n     Although he will deny it later, two klansmen swear that Benny \n     Hays declares to the meeting assembled; ``Get this down: If a \n     black man can kill a white man, a white man should be able to \n     get away with killing a black man . . .''.\n       Klansman James (Tiger) Knowles, 17, borrows a 22-caliber \n     pistol. Then Knowles, fellow klansman Benjamin Franklin Cox, \n     20, and Henry Hays, 26, who is Bennie Hays' son and a member \n     of the klan as well, go to Cox's home and pick up a rope. \n     They tell Cox's mother they need it to tow a car.\n       They listen for word. On Friday night, Knowles and Cox go \n     to Henry Hays' home to catch the 10 o'clock news. In the car, \n     Tiger Knowles knots a hangman's noose. As they pull up chairs \n     in front of Henry Hays' TV, a newscaster announces that the \n     jury in the black man's case has, indeed, deadlocked. If the \n     black man is not retried, he will go free.\n       Henry Hays and Tiger Knowles burst for the door. They drive \n     straight to a black \n     [[Page S6037]] neighborhood. They see an elderly black man, \n     but he is too far from their car. Besides, he is on a public \n     telephone--he could appeal for help.\n       Not far away, Michael Donald, 19, the youngest son of \n     Beulah Mae Donald, 61, is walking home from his sister's \n     house. A masonry student at Carver State Technical College, \n     Michael Donald works part time in the mail room at the Mobile \n     Press Register. He is quite, broad-shouldered and well-\n     mannered. He likes music, plays basketball on a community \n     team, dates two or three girls.\n       As he detours to a corner gas station to buy cigarettes, \n     Henry Hays and Tiger Knowles pull up.\n       They motion him over.\n       Knowles asks the way to a nightclub, and Michael Donald \n     starts to direct him.\n       ``Come closer,'' Knowles says.\n       Michael Donald leans over. Knowles pulls out the pistol.\n       ``Be quiet,'' Knowles says.\n       They order him into the car and drive across Mobile Bay and \n     into the woods.\n       ``I can't believe this is happening,'' Michael Donald \n     pleads. ``I'll do anything you want. Beat me; just don't kill \n     me. Please don't kill me.''\n       The car stops. They order him out. Knowles holds the \n     pistol. Michael Donald grabs him. All three scuffle for the \n     gun. It goes off.\n       The bullet whines into the air.\n       Henry Hays pulls a knife. Michael jerks free. He runs. They \n     chase him. He grabs a fallen tree limb. They knock it away. \n     Hays has the noose. They wrestle it over Michael's head. \n     Michael pulls on the rope, running in circles. Knowles holds \n     the other end and beats him, again and again, with the tree \n     limb.\n       Michael collapses.\n       Henry Hays pushes his boot into Michael's face and pulls \n     the rope tight.\n       They drag him through the dirt to the car. They lift him \n     into the trunk. Knowles asks Hays if he thinks Michael is \n     dead.\n       ``I don't know,'' Hays replies. ``But I'm gonna make \n     sure.''\n       He cuts Michael's throat--three times.\n       They drive back to Henry Hays' house and throw one end of \n     the rope over the limb of a camphor tree across the street. \n     Then they lift Michael by the neck--high enough to swing.\n       From the porch, the rest of the klansmen can see.\n       As Knowles steps back up to join them, he feels a friendly \n     pinch.\n       ``Good job, Tiger.''\n       In the dead of night, two of the klansmen drive downtown to \n     the Mobile County courthouse. Out front, they set flame to a \n     cross. And in the cool of the early morning, the city finds \n     Beulah Mae Donald's son, hanging from the camphor tree, \n     bruised, broken, dead.\n       Despite the rope and the burning cross, the Mobile County \n     district attorney declares that race--much less the Ku Klux \n     Klan--does not seem to be a factor in Michael Donald's death.\n       But the black community calls it a lynching.\n       Beulah Mae Donald's attorney, state Sen. Michael Figures, \n     says it is clear to him that, at the very least, white \n     extremists of some kind are involved.\n       Whites accuse Figures, who is black, of stirring up racism.\n       The police investigate, but they do not question the klan. \n     Instead, they look into a theory that Michael Donald might \n     have been involved with a white woman at the Press Register \n     and gotten killed in a love triangle. Than they investigate a \n     theory that he might have gotten killed in a drug deal. They \n     arrest three men they describe as junkies. But when the case \n     goes to a county grand jury, it tumbles apart.\n       Thousands of blacks march in protest.\n       All Beulah Mae Donald wants, she says, is ``to know who \n     really killed my child.''\n       Michael Figures' brother, Thomas, an assistant U.S. \n     attorney in Mobile, asks for a second investigation--this \n     time by a federal grand jury.\n       And this time, Tiger Knowles cracks.\n       He plea-bargains. In return for his testimony, Knowles gets \n     life--and Henry Hays gets death.\n       There the matter of Michael Donald might remain--but for \n     the district attorney, who continues to maintain the klan's \n     innocence. ``I'm not sure this as a klan case,'' the district \n     attorney says. Rather, he declares, this was a case in which \n     members of the Ku Klux Klan just happen to have been \n     involved.\n       Morris Dees simply does not believe it, and he cannot \n     ignore it.\n       From what he can plainly see, Tiger Knowles and Henry Hays \n     did not act in a vacuum. Dees calls Michael Figures and \n     suggests that Beulah Mae Donald and the NAACP filed a civil \n     suit against the United Klans of America, headed by Robert \n     Shelton, its imperial wizard. Dees proposes to prove that the \n     killers carried out a policy of violence for which the klan \n     is responsible--just as a corporation is liable for the \n     actions of its employees when they carry out its policies.\n       Although individual klansmen--Tiger Knowles and Henry \n     Hays--were prosecuted, nobody has ever tried suing United \n     Klans as a whole for damages. The idea, Dees says, would be \n     to win a financial judgment large enough to bankrupt it.\n       Beulah Mae Donald approves.\n       On her behalf, Morris Dees sues United Klans of America in \n     U.S. District Court in Mobile for $10 million.\n       The klan sees trouble.\n       Even before jury selection, it consents to a broad \n     injunction against harrassing blacks. Then, as the trial gets \n     under way, Morris Dees calls Tiger Knowles to testify.\n       Flanked by federal marshals, Knowles walks into court, pest \n     Beulah Mae Donald at the plaintiff's table.\n       Already a turncoat for testifying against Henry Hays, today \n     he will add to the vengeance the klan feels against him. He \n     walks past former fellow klansmen, seated at the defense \n     table. Next to them is Shelton, their imperial wizard. Not a \n     defendant, he is there as the chief officer of United Klans.\n       Morris Dees questions Knowles softly, Knowles tells how it \n     was that Michael Donald died.\n       ``We got the gun,'' Tiger recalls, ``and then later . . . I \n     tied the hangman's noose in Henry's car.''\n       Throat cut, face bruised, clothing in disarray, wounds on \n     the hands. Was that his work?\n       ``Yes.''\n       Dees holds up a drawing from a klan newspaper edited and \n     published by Shelton. It shows a black man with a noose \n     around his neck.\n       Had Tiger seen the drawing before he killed Michael?\n       ``Yes.''\n       Had it influenced him?\n       ``Yes, it did.''\n       Tiger steps down to show how Michael Donald was strangled.\n       Beulah Mae Donald sobs softly.\n       John Mays, the klan attorney, asks Tiger if he had heard \n     Shelton order violence.\n       No, Tiger replies, but ``he instructed us to follow our \n     leaders.''\n       Tiger recalls how Bennie Hays had suggested that if a black \n     man could get away with killing a white man, then a white man \n     ought to be able to get away with killing a black man.\n       ``Mr. Hays is who I took orders from . . . He took his \n     orders from Mr. Shelton. . . .\n       ``All I know is I was carrying out orders.''\n       Mays concedes that Michael's murder is a ``horrible \n     atrocity''--but he tries to portray the klan as a political \n     organization. Shelton tells the jury that white supremacy is \n     a political goal--nothing more. He says that nothing in the \n     klan bylaws approves of violence. He says that he does not \n     advocate violence.\n       Shelton adds triumphantly: ``I'm not ashamed to be a white \n     person.''\n       In America, Mays says, ``we don't punish the organization. \n     We punish the individuals.''\n       But Dees counters with a tutorial in klan history. With \n     testimony from some former klansmen and depositions from \n     others, he shows how Shelton personally directed the infamous \n     Mother's Day attack in 1961 on Freedom Riders at the \n     Trailways bus station in Birmingham; how a United klansman \n     was convicted of bombing Birmingham's 16th Street Baptist \n     Church in 1963, killing four black girls as they prepared to \n     participate in the 11 o'clock service; how four klansmen \n     killed Viola Liuzzo, a white civil-rights worker, in 1965 \n     after hearing Shelton say, ``If necessary, you know, just do \n     what you have got to do,'' and how in 1978, just 2\\1/2\\ years \n     before Michael Donald was killed, Shelton told a group of \n     klansmen, ``Sometimes you just got to get out there and stop \n     them,'' after which the klansmen fired shots into the homes \n     of blacks, including the state president of the National \n     Assn. for the Advancement of Colored People.\n       Ku Klux Klan policy is hardly politics, Dees declares. Make \n     no mistake, he says, it is violence.\n       Finally, Dees calls klansman William O'Connor to the stand. \n     On TV news tape the day that Michael died, Bennie Hays had \n     been pictured walking up to the camphor tree to look at his \n     body. O'Connor tells the jury that Hays had said it was ``a \n     pretty sight.''\n       Hays, acting as his own lawyer, calls O'Connor a liar. He \n     says he had no knowledge of any plans to kill Michael \n     Donald--and that anybody who says anything to the contrary is \n     lying.\n       ``I have never in my life heard anybody talk about a \n     hanging,'' he tells the jury. He says lynching talk was a \n     ``no-no'' during klan meetings. And, Bennie Hays says, Henry, \n     his convicted son, still maintains that he is innocent.\n       As both sides wind up their cases, Tiger Knowles summons \n     Morris Dees to his jail cell. Although he has been testifying \n     for the plaintiffs, Tiger is a defendant--and he wants to \n     offer a closing statement of his own.\n       ``Say what you feel,'' Dees counsels.\n       When court resumes, Tiger Knowles, one of the killers of \n     Michael Donald, stands in front of the jury box.\n       He won't take long, he says. He knows people have tried to \n     discredit his testimony, but everything he has spoken is \n     true. ``I've lost my family, and I've got people after me,'' \n     he says. ``I was acting as a klansman. I hope people learn \n     from my mistakes, learn what it cost me.''\n       He turns to the jurors, ``Return a verdict against me,'' he \n     says, beginning to shake, ``and everything else.''\n       Then he turns to Beulah Mae Donald. He pauses.\n       He is in prison for life--but he is alive. Her son is dead. \n     Trembling, then sobbing, Tiger Knowles apologizes. Jurors are \n     crying, Judge Alex T. Howard, Jr., wipes his eyes. Tiger \n     tells Beulah Mae Donald that he has nothing to pay her, but \n     if it takes the rest of his life \n     [[Page S6038]] to make amends, he will--for any comfort it \n     may bring. As for her son, he says, ``God knows, if I could \n     trade places with him, I would.''\n       Softly, from her chair, Beulah Mae Donald forgives him.\n       The members of the jury deliberate for four hours. In the \n     end, they award her $7 million.\n       The klan cannot pay. It has nowhere near that kind of \n     money. So, in addition to a quarter of the wages some of the \n     klansmen will earn for the rest of their lives, and in \n     addition to Titan Bernie Hays' house and farm, Beulah Mae \n     Donald accepts every penny of the several thousand dollars \n     that the United Klans of America has to its name--and the \n     deed and keys to its national headquarters.\n       She shuts it down.\n       Before, during and after victory, retribution from the klan \n     and other white racists is a worry for Dees and his staff--\n     sometimes a big one.\n       One night in the summer of 1983, a man stops his pickup on \n     South McDonough Street, not far from an entrance to the \n     Montgomery city sewer system. Two younger men step out of the \n     truck. Silently they drop down into the sewer, out of sight.\n       The older man drives off.\n       He is Joe Garner, 37, a convenience store operator. The \n     younger men are Tommy Downs and Charles (Dink) Bailey, both \n     20, who rent a room from Garner behind one of his stores, out \n     in the county near Snowdoun. Besides being their landlord, \n     Garner has become an influence on their lives.\n       For their mission of the moment, Garner has given Downs and \n     Bailey a flashlight, a pair of brown gloves, some silver duct \n     tape, a garden sprayer and a container of gasoline. They \n     carry these items, in an old canvas bag, down into the sewer. \n     One block north, on Hull Street, they climb out of the sewer \n     and slip along Hull to the Southern Poverty Law Center. They \n     dash into some bushes in back.\n       Earlier the same evening, Morris Dees has returned to the \n     law center from northern Alabama, where he gave federal \n     investigators evidence against members of the Invisible \n     Empire, Knights of the Ku Klux Klan. This particular arm of \n     the klan had attacked the president of the Southern Christian \n     Leadership Conference and other blacks during a civil-rights \n     march in Decatur, and Dees' evidence--including the \n     identities of many of the assailants--eventually will lead to \n     the conviction of several klansmen, including a former grand \n     wizard.\n       After the criminal trial, Dees will sue the Invisible \n     Empire, Knights of the Ku Klux Klan, winning an $11,500 \n     settlement for the marchers and a ban against further \n     harassment. And--more galling still--he will win a court \n     decree ordering seven klan members to sit down with civil-\n     rights leaders, who will teach them race relations.\n       Hours before Tommy Downs and Dink Bailey arrive at the law \n     center, Dees and his investigators have locked the front door \n     and gone home.\n       Tommy Downs eases out of the bushes. By his signed account \n     to investigators, he sticks some of the duct tape to a back \n     window, then taps along the tape with a tire tool. The glass \n     cracks silently under the tape, and he lifts it out.\n       He runs back to the bushes and listens for a burglar alarm. \n     There is none. Someone has forgotten to set it.\n       Downs fills the sprayer with gasoline. Then he slips \n     through the broken window. With Dink Bailey standing guard \n     outside, Downs sprays the carpet with gasoline. He sprays \n     around the desks and around the filing cabinets, then opens a \n     few drawers and sprays inside. He lights the gasoline--and \n     crawls back outside.\n       Downs and Bailey run along Hull Street and climb back down \n     into the sewer. They wait.\n       A smoke detector alerts the fire department. From an \n     opening in the sewer, Downs and Bailey watch as fire trucks \n     and police arrive. Then they duck down and make their escape.\n       At the law center, the gasoline vaporizes quickly, and the \n     fire follows the vapor straight up. It scorches the carpeting \n     and the file cabinets and causes $140,000 worth of damage to \n     the walls, frame and ceiling. But virtually all of Dees' \n     evidence against the klan--in the file drawers--survives.\n       When Dees arrives, the fire is still burning. On the wall, \n     the law center clock is melted to a halt: 3:48 a.m.\n       Morris Dees has a hunch.\n       About a month before, he remembers, he had summoned Joe \n     Garner to the law center for a deposition in the Decatur \n     case. Garner had denied being a klan member--but Joe Garner \n     sounded like someone who might carry a grudge, even against \n     being questioned.\n       Dees checks into Garner's background--and into the past of \n     his two renters. He discovers that when Tommy Downs moved \n     from a previous address, he left behind a certificate that \n     declared him to be a member of the klan. And the klan \n     certificate is signed by none other than Joe Garner.\n       Within weeks, a law center investigator finds, a photo \n     showing Tommy Downs marching at a klan rally--and Joe Garner \n     marching in front of him. Both are wearing klan robes. On the \n     arm of Garner's robe, just above the wrist, are the stripes \n     of an exalted cyclops.\n       Dees brings the certificate and the photo to the Montgomery \n     County district attorney.\n       The district attorney summons Tommy Downs before a grand \n     jury and points out that lying could mean jail for perjury. \n     Downs begins to cry. He confesses that he torched the \n     Southern Poverty Law Center. It was Joe Garner, he says, who \n     wanted it done--to destroy all of Dees' evidence against the \n     Ku Klux Klan. And Tommy Downs reveals that Joe Garner has \n     more in mind.\n       He wants to blow up downtown Montgomery.\n       Civil-rights leaders are planning a march. Downs says \n     Garner wants to plant dynamite in the sewers beneath the \n     streets--and touch it off as the civil-rights leaders pass \n     overhead. The district attorney investigates--and finds 123 \n     7-ounce sticks of dynamite and 8 pounds of plastic explosive. \n     That, says a bomb expert with the Alabama Department of \n     Public Safety, is enough to destroy an entire city block.\n       In addition, Downs says, Garner wants to set explosives on \n     Morris Dees' car and blow it up one day when Dees drives to \n     work.\n       The authorities arrest Joe Garner. He, Downs and Bailey \n     plead guilty to a variety of state and federal charges. Joe \n     Garner is sent to federal prison for 15 years. Downs and \n     Bailey get lesser sentences.\n       Often, retribution is aimed solely at Morris Dees.\n       In one of his early fights, he wins a court order ending \n     harassment of Vietnamese fishermen along the Texas Gulf \n     Coast. The order is against a group of Texas fishermen--and a \n     band of klansmen headed by Louis Beam, the Texas grand dragon \n     of the Knights of the Ku Klux Klan.\n       Worse for the Knights, Dees wins a second court order that \n     disbands Beam's Texas Emergency Reserve--a group of \n     paramilitary klansmen organized into what amounts to a \n     private army. During the legal proceedings, Beam calls Morris \n     Dees an Antichrist Jew and holds out a Bible and cross to \n     exorcise his demons.\n       And Louis Beam never forgets his humiliating defeat.\n       He leaves Texas and goes to Hayden Lake, Ida., where \n     Richard Butler heads the Aryan Nations, an umbrella group of \n     hard-core white racists. From Hayden Lake, Louis Beam writes \n     to Dees and challenges him to a ``dual [sic] to the death--\n     you against me. . . .\n       ``If you are the base, despicable, lowdown, vile poltroon I \n     think you are--you will of course decline, in which case my \n     original supposition will have been proven correct, and your \n     lack of character verified . . .'' Beam writes, ``Your \n     mother--think of her, why I can just see her now, her heart \n     just bursting with pride as you, for the first time in your \n     life, exhibit the qualities of a man and march off to the \n     field of honor. (Every mother has a right to be proud of her \n     son once). . . .''\n       When he gets no reply, Beam goes to Montgomery. He meets \n     with Joe Garner, who has just come under investigation for \n     the law center fire. An FBI report, recounting an agent's \n     interview with Garner, says that Beam tells Garner he thinks \n     Dees is ``scum.''\n       According to the report, Garner introduces Beam to one of \n     Dees' cousins--who does not like Morris Dees and shows Beam \n     where Dees lives. The report says Beam videotapes Dees' \n     property, including details of his home. Then Beam talks his \n     way into the lobby of the Southern Poverty Law Center. An \n     investigator throws him out.\n       At about the same time, another white supremacist who \n     frequents the Aryan Nations compound in Idaho takes up what \n     is now becoming a growing cause: killing Morris Dees.\n       He is Robert Mathews, who organized the Order, which seeks \n     to wrest large portions of the United States away from its \n     ``Zionist Occupied Government,'' and to establish a nation \n     for whites only. The Order has in mind banning all other \n     races, whom it calls ``God's mistakes''--and it wants to kill \n     all Jews, whom it considers the seed of Satan.\n       Mathews formulates six steps to accomplish this. Step Five \n     is the assassination of ``racial enemies''--and Dees in at \n     the top of Mathews' hit list.\n       After a stop in Denver, where he and his men kill Alan \n     Berg, a radio talk-show host who likes to bait racists, \n     Mathews heads south. A resident of Birmingham who belongs to \n     the Aryan Nations says Mathews asks him to gather all the \n     information he can on Dees--but he refuses because he does \n     not want to become involved.\n       Finally, Mathews tries to send a confederate, who is \n     actually an FBI informant, south to finish Dees off.\n       The informant says that Mathews orders him ``to kidnap \n     [Dees], torture him, get information out of him, kill him, \n     then bury him in the ground and put lye on it.''\n       Within days, the FBI surrounds Mathews' hide-out on Whidbey \n     Island in Puget Sound in Washington state. The FBI wants \n     Mathews for a variety of crimes that include the slaying of \n     Alan Berg and the $3.8 million robbery of a Brinks truck to \n     finance the Order's incipient white racist revolution.\n       On Whidbey Island, Mathews and the FBI shoot it out. Night \n     falls. It is a standoff. FBI agents fire flares. The flares \n     ignite Mathews' house, and he is burned to death.\n       One of the last of his men to be captured is Bruce Pierce, \n     fingered by others as the Alan Berg triggerman.\n       FBI agents arrest him in Rossville, Ga. In his van, the \n     agents find cash, weapons and several news articles, \n     including one about Morris Dees.\n       [[Page S6039]] The next day, agents stop Pierce's wife. She \n     is in Dees' state--Alabama. In her trailer, the FBI finds \n     nine weapons and several books:\n       ``Hit Men: A Technical Manual for Independent \n     Contractors.''\n       ``Assassination: Theory and Practice.''\n       Volume 1-5 of ``How to Kill.''\n       In August, 1989, the FBI opens an investigation into \n     information from Georgia that some klansmen are yet again \n     plotting to kill Morris Dees.\n       The information comes as Dees takes legal steps to collect \n     a judgment he won for 75 civil-rights marchers attacked by \n     the klan in Forsyth County, Ga., two years ago.\n       The judgment totaled $1 million. It was a crushing blow to \n     both the Invisible Empire and the Southern White Knights.\n       ``We think,'' Dees says, ``it got them riled up.''\n       More people are likely to get riled up as Morris Dees moves \n     against Tom Metzger and his White Aryan Resistance.\n       Metzger, 51, is a one-time member of the John Birch Society \n     who became the California grand dragon of the Knights of the \n     Ku Klux Klan. As a klansman, he ran for Congress in 1960 from \n     California's 43rd District. It reaches across northern and \n     eastern San Diego County, Imperial County and part of \n     Riverside County.\n       In the 1980 primary election, Metzger attracted 33,071 \n     vote--enough to win the district's Democratic congressional \n     nomination.\n       Although he ultimately got swamped, his primary election \n     success gave him what he called ``great exposure.'' In 1982, \n     he ran unsuccessfully for the U.S. Senate--then founded the \n     White Aryan Resistance.\n       Today Tom Metzger, a TV repairman, runs the White Aryan \n     Resistance from Fallbrook, in San Diego County. He is the \n     host of ``Race and Reason,'' a TV interview program available \n     to subscribers on more than 50 cable systems in at least a \n     dozen states. The White Aryan Resistance publishes a \n     newspaper. Metzger is linked by computer to white \n     supremacists across the nation.\n       Like members of the Order, Metzger has held to racist \n     tenets over the years, including the belief that non-whites \n     are ``God's mistakes'' and that Jews are the progency of \n     Satan.\n       Metzger has a 21-year-old son, John, who heads his youth \n     recruitment. John Metzger runs an organization known as the \n     White Student Union, the Aryan Youth Movement, the WAR Youth \n     or the WAR Skins.\n       As the latter name implies, the Metzgers are hospitable to \n     skinheads, young thugs who shave their skulls and favor \n     military-style clothing. Skinheads strut about in heavy boots \n     with steel toes, known as Doc Martens--and they sometimes \n     carry clubs. Often the clubs are baseball bats. Tom Metzger \n     supplies the skinheads with his White Aryan Resistance \n     newspaper. Its comics feature the killing of blacks and Jews.\n       In a lawsuit filed in October, Dees and lawyers for the \n     Anti-Defamation League of B'nai B'rith accuse Tom and John \n     Metzger of sending agents to Portland, Ore., to organize and \n     guide a particular group of skinheads called the East Side \n     White Pride. ``The agents reported regularly to . . . [the \n     Metzgers] concerning their organizing efforts,'' the suit \n     says. ``The agents also urged . . . [the skinheads] to call . \n     . . Tom Metzger's telephone hot line to receive aid, \n     encouragement and direction.''\n       One night a year ago, the suit says, Metzger's agents and \n     the East Side White Pride held an organizational meeting of \n     particular interest. ``At that meeting,'' according to the \n     suit, ``the agents . . . in accordance with the [Metzgers] \n     directions . . . encouraged members of the East Side White \n     Pride to commit violent acts against blacks.''\n       And on that same night, in southeast Portland, two friends \n     drop off Mulugeta Seraw, 28, a black Ethiopian immigrant, in \n     front of his apartment.\n       It is 1:30 a.m. Seraw works for Avis Rent-A-Car at the \n     Portland airport. He sends money home to his parents, a son \n     and five brothers and sisters in Ethiopia, where he hopes to \n     return after attending Portland State University. Mulugeta \n     Seraw goes to work at 7 a.m. Bedtime is long past.\n       He does not make it to his door.\n       Three skinheads attack him. One has a baseball bat.\n       Mulugeta Seraw's two friends, also black jump from their \n     car. They are beaten back.\n       ``Kick them!'' scream two teen-age girls, watching nearby. \n     ``Kill them!''\n       Three minutes later, Seraw is lying in the street, \n     bleeding, broken.\n       Neighbors call the police. Mulugeta Seraw is taken to a \n     hospital. Doctors pronounce him dead.\n       Working with descriptions provided by witnesses, police \n     track down Kenneth Mieske, 23, a performer of ``hate metal'' \n     rock music who uses the name Ken Death; Kyle Brewster, 19, \n     and Steven Strasser, 20. All are members of the East Side \n     White Pride.\n       Mieske pleads guilty to murder and Brewster and Strasser to \n     manslaughter. Mieske gets a life sentence, which carries \n     mandatory imprisonment of 20 years. Brewster gets a 20-year \n     sentence, with a minimum of 10 years' imprisonment. Strasser \n     plea-bargains for a sentence of 9 to 20 years.\n       In their lawsuit, filed on behalf of Mulugeta Seraw's \n     uncle, Engedaw Berhanu, who is the executor of his estate, \n     Dees and the Anti-Defamation League charge the Metzgers, \n     their White Aryan Resistance and skinheads Mieske and \n     Brewster with wrongful death and conspiracy to violate \n     Seraw's civil rights.\n       ``The actions of the Oregon defendants in attacking Seraw \n     were undertaken pursuant to the custom and practice of the \n     defendant WAR of pursuing its racist goals through violent \n     means,'' the suit says. Moreover, it says, the actions were \n     undertaken `'with the encouragement and substantial \n     assistance of the California defendants.''\n       Without specifying an amount, Dees and the Anti-Defamation \n     League ask for punitive and compensatory damages to punish \n     the Metzgers and to deter ``further outrageous conduct of \n     this kind.''\n       Legally, this lawsuit is similar to the lawsuit in which \n     Beulah Mae Donald won the last pennies in the coffers of the \n     United Klans of America and the keys to its headquarters. And \n     this is just what Morris Dees and the ADL have in mind.\n       But unlike the United Klans of America, Tom Metzger says, \n     he will win. ``They lost more because of the UKA's \n     incompetence than anything else,'' Metzger says. ``And \n     because the UKA failed to appeal.\n       ``There is absolutely no basis for this suit,'' Metzger \n     says. ``I don't have agents. We are not into telling anybody \n     to go down out on the streets and get anybody and beat on \n     them. Anybody who says that my son or I have said that is \n     lying.''\n       About his chief adversary, Metzger says: ``Morris Dees is a \n     clever fellow, and he's had some success. So we don't take \n     this lightly.\n       ``But I am not exactly a pushover, either.''\n       For his efforts. Morris Dees gets awards--from civil-rights \n     groups, Common Cause, bar associations and the like. But he \n     also gets criticism--from writers in magazines such as the \n     Progressive and the Other Side, a liberal publication that \n     prints a giver's guide to charitable foundations.\n       The criticism focuses on the Southern Poverty Law Centers \n     focuses on the Southern Poverty Law Center's $27-million \n     endowment and its $3-million annual budget. The center has a \n     stylish new building. Wags call it the Poverty Place. When \n     Dees and the center attack racists, these critics say, they \n     attack a foe who is no longer an important threat--but they \n     do it anyway to improve donors and make the center's \n     endowment grow.\n       Dees makes no apology for resources. It takes money, he \n     says, to win lawsuits--and to provide the security that the \n     center and its four lawyers need.\n       And certainly, Dees says, the klan is not the threat it \n     once was. His own experts at the law center say that klan \n     membership is down to one of its lowest levels in history. \n     Credit goes to good times economically. In bad times, poor \n     whites tend to take out their frustrations on blacks. Credit \n     also goes, the experts say, to police work--as well as to \n     antiklan groups.\n       So why does Morris Dees keep on doing what he does?\n       He is a multimillionaires. He does not need his law center \n     salary of $79,600--more than what many of the 35 members of \n     his staff earn, but less than the six-figure salary his top \n     staff attorney makes.\n       Why does he keep putting himself in bam's way?\n       He leans back, crosses a soakless loafer over one knee and \n     pauses.\n       First, the threat of racist terror may have eased some, but \n     it has not ended. ``If you don't think skinheads are any \n     threat, then go ask the Seraws if their son is alive.''\n       Second, he has always liked a good fight, ``I've had my ass \n     whipped, and I've whipped a few. . . . We absolutely take no \n     prisoners. When we get into a legal fight, we go all the way. \n     . . . Ever since I've been a kid, I've always liked a good \n     challenge.''\n       Third, although he was raised a Baptist, he feels a kinship \n     with Jews. ``My middle name is Seligman, and my family may \n     have some Jewish connections. . . . You know, years ago, \n     nobody took the threat to the Jews seriously. I am not saying \n     that Louis Bearn and his crowd will duplicate what happened \n     in Nazi Germany. I would think that this country is quite \n     different. But I do see it as just a personal responsibility \n     to do what I can to stop just a little bit of this happening \n     right here. . . . And with the legal training I've got and \n     what we've put together here, we're in a unique position to \n     do it. . . .\n       Like Morris Dees daddy, when he took Perry Lee's hoe. . . .\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The litigation explosion \nsince the 1970's when I left the private sector and entered public life \nhas made the job of running a small business more difficult today than \nit was when my wife and I started our own successful small business. \nThe Dole amendment will restore some degree of certainty to business, \npersonal and charitable risk management and \n[[Page S6040]] planning; all of which help facilitate commerce in this \ngreat Nation.\n  Punitive damages are a wild card in today's legal system. These \nawards are unpredictable, unrelated to the level of harm caused by a \ndefendant and potentially they are unlimited. A particular injury, a \nparticular lawyer, and a particular jurisdiction can mean a big \nrecovery for the plaintiff and his lawyer and the end of business for \nthe unlucky defendant.\n  The real cost of the current system is not only measured in the \nnumber of punitive awards won, but also the legal cost of defending \nagainst such suits, as well as the increased insurance and product \ncosts for all Americans.\n  Certainly, no one wants to create a legal system which will encourage \nwrongdoing or careless behavior. The problem is that the relationship \nbetween punitive damage awards and safe behavior is not proven. One \ncould argue that the current punitive damages system creates a bounty\n for the litigators to hunt for the right combination of facts, law, \njury, and injury.\n\n  This uncertainty has led honest business people to settle even \nunworthy cases in order to avoid risking a spin at litigation and the \nroulette wheel mentality that goes with it.\n  The greatest expense of the current uncertainty is the contempt it \ngenerates from average citizens. They hear about unexplainable cases \ninvolving cups of hot coffee, or spilled milk shakes and their faith in \nthe legal system is shaken. Our hallowed courts could some day take on \nthe image of a legal casino.\n  A handful of States, including the State of Nebraska, do not even \npermit punitive damages. In the State of Nebraska the total absence of \npunitive damages has not created an unsafe environment or careless \nmanufacturers or increased wrongful conduct. What the State of Nebraska \ndoes have are insurance rates which are more affordable to all \ncitizens.\n  Under the Dole amendment, States which want to keep punitive damages \ncan continue to have such a system, if that is their will. In those \nStates, punitive damages would simply need to be related to the actual \ncompensatory damages suffered by an injured party. Nothing in this \namendment would require States to adopt punitive damage systems.\n  Mr. President, I am pleased to cosponsor and support the Dole \namendment. To those who predict the end of American jurisprudence, I \nsay come to Nebraska, Washington, or other States where punitive \ndamages are not part of the State's legal system. You will see a high \nquality of life, affordable cost of living, and court systems a little \nless jammed with frivolous lawsuits.\n  Although not as dramatic as the course chosen by the State of \nNebraska, I am confident that the Dole amendment is a step in the right \ndirection to restore a degree of confidence and predictability to our \nlegal system.\n  I thank the Chair. I thank my friend from Washington for yielding. I \nyield any remaining time of the 7 minutes originally allotted to this \nSenator.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from \nUtah.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I want to pay tribute to the distinguished \nSenator from Nebraska for his fine statement and for his support of \nthis amendment on this floor. I think many people in this country are \ngrateful for his leadership in this matter.\n  Let me spend a few seconds on some of the comments made by one of my \ndear friends, Senator Heflin, when he was here. He made reference to \nwhat evidence may be inadmissible in the compensatory damages phase of \nthe trial.\n  It must be emphasized that the evidentiary restrictions on the Dole-\nExon-Hatch amendment are based on State law. The relevant language is \nsection 107(d)(1).\n\n       Evidence relevant only to the claim of punitive damages, as \n     determined by applicable State law, shall be admissible to \n     determine whether compensatory damages are to be awarded. \n     Whether particular evidence is admissible or inadmissible, \n     therefore, depends on the facts of the case and the law of \n     the State in which the action is brought. Moreover, if \n     evidence is relevant only to punitive damages, there is no \n     reason to object to excluding it in the compensatory damages \n     case, and indeed such exclusion accords with the traditional \n     rule . . . that irrelevant evidence is inadmissible.\n\n  I must mention that bifurcated proceedings in punitive damages cases \nare required or permitted under current law in almost all jurisdictions \nthat permit claims for punitive damages.\n  Let me turn to the Dole-Exon-Hatch amendment. Naturally, I support \nthis amendment. It is an amendment worthy of adoption. Unlike the Dole \namendment, several other amendments have been offered that, in my view, \nweaken our efforts to reform punitive damages abuses. Thus, I cannot \nsupport those weakening amendments such as an amendment to remove \nlimits on the award of punitive damages.\n  Yesterday I came to the floor and spoke at\n   length about curbing the abuses in our punitive damages laws and the \nneed for meaningful reform in this area. I would like to consider \nanother example of out of control punitive damages and their impact. \nConsider the case of Sherridan v. Northwest Mutual Life Insurance, 630 \nSo. 2d 384 (Ala. 1993). The insurance company in this case undertook a \nbackground check and numerous interviews of a person who became an \nagent for the company.\n\n  Moreover, in that case, the company, once it became aware that its \nagent had defrauded some policyholders, arguably did everything it \ncould to rectify the situation. In fact, it was Northwestern Mutual \nthat first notified the plaintiffs that payments made to an agent to \npay for life insurance premiums were retained by him. The agent fled \nafter he was confronted by the company. The company then offered to \nrefund money with 10-percent interest and to reimburse them for any \nfees and expenses they may incur related to the money taken by their \nagent. The company appeared to do everything it possibly could do to \nmake the victims whole for any and all loss.\n  Despite their effort to screen out wayward job applicants and a good \nfaith effort to resolve this most unfortunate incident, the company was \nultimately sued for compensatory and punitive damages. I should also \nmention that the policyholders, owners of a small business, whose \noriginal loss was $9,000, were the only policyholders out of 40 who \nheld out and sued, rather than settle the case. Reportedly, at trial \nthere were many repeated and exaggerated references to the wealth of \nthe company, yet the jury was not allowed to hear of Northwestern \nMutual's efforts to resolve the claim.\n  The Alabama jury--again an Alabama case, a State where tort law seems \nto be running out of control--awarded the plaintiff $400,000 in \ncompensatory damages and $26 million in punitive damages. The Alabama \nSupreme Court reduced the punitive award to $13 million.\n  So they have the award. They are prone to do this.\n  Now let us think seriously about this case. The owners of a small \nautomotive business were defrauded of $9,000 and, in response, the \ncourts turned these individuals into multimillionaires. How anyone can \ndefend a system that would allow such an injustice is beyond me. It \nreally requires some world class rationalization.\n  Our legal system is in danger of losing all credibility in the eyes \nof the public as an institution where justice is served. It is unfair \nto American business, to American consumers, and the American public.\n Look. The people who are benefiting primarily by these types of \noutrageous awards and by the lack of restraint in this area are \nattorneys. Not all attorneys, however, should not be maligned because \nof these abuses by a few trial lawyers. Our profession is being hurt by \ntrial lawyers who want to win it all at all costs, who will win at all \ncosts, who are buying judges, who are influencing judges by \ncontributions and who literally are denigrating the whole legal \nprofession.\n\n  A competent lawyer can still win big damage awards by getting good \neconomic damage awards and good noneconomic damage awards. A good \nlawyer does not need to allege and recover punitive damages to serve \nhis client well. In fact, when I practiced law up to 19 years ago, we \nused to get big awards for both economic and noneconomic losses.\n  Let me just say this: There is plenty of room to recover a \nsignificant damage award by arguing persuasively and doing a competent \njob as a trial attorney. We do not need to have runaway \n[[Page S6041]] juries and runaway courts of law and runaway attorneys \nupping runaway punitive damage awards. These abuses are what we are \ntrying to correct here through our amendment. Punitive damages needs to \nbe corrected because our country is being dislocated by these out-of-\ncontrol approaches to the law.\n  So I hope that our colleagues will vote down some of these \namendments. I hope that they will vote for this Dole-Exon-Hatch \npunitive damages amendment. I think that it will correct some of the \ndifficulties of our current system, while at the same time provide for \na continuation of good, fair, reasonable laws in our country.\n  Keep in mind, this judgment affects policy holders and insurance \nrates throughout the country, not just in one state. While this case \narose in Alabama, the cost of these excessive judgments are passed on \nto all its customers throughout the United States.\n  Moreover, the very fact that a jury could award such an outrageous \namount of punitive damages cannot go unnoticed by those who make and \nsell goods and services in this country. An award like this adds to the \noverall litigation climate in this country. It fuels the understandable \nperception that the system is a lottery with more and more jackpots. \nAnd those who can get socked with such awards by run away juries have \nto take that into account as they price their goods and services--to \nthe detriment of consumers.\n  Mr. President, I have heard a number of my colleagues who are opposed \nto punitive damage reform claim that there is no increase in reported \npunitive damage awards, and thus no need for reform. The figure they \nrepeatedly cite is a figure from one study that found 355 punitive \ndamage awards granted by juries in product liability cases in the \nperiod 1965-90. On that basis, they claim that there is no problem with \npunitive damages in this country and that, consequently, no legislative \nsolution is required.\n  This could not be further from the truth. I have been well aware of \nthat study, as have many others. However, what I have learned in \nstudying punitive damages, and in listing to experts testify at \nhearings I chaired in the Judiciary Committee is that no one has a \nprecise handle on the number of these awards. That data is simply not \navailable. In fact, those who cite to the study seem to have missed an \nenlightening statement on the second page of that study. On that page, \nit is acknowledged:\n\n       The actual number of punitive damage awards in product \n     liability litigation is unknown and possibly unknowable \n     because no comprehensible reporting system exists. [See \n     Michael Rustad, ``Demystifying Punitive Damages in Product \n     Liability Cases'' (1992), at p. 2.]\n\n  In addition, testimony in the Judiciary Committee by Victor Schwartz \nindicated that other research demonstrated that, in just 5 States since \n1990, 411 jury verdicts have awarded punitive damages. Punitive damage \nawards are certainly more frequent than opponents of this measure are \nwilling to admit. And, of course, the Dole amendment covers all civil \nactions. There have also been a number of punitive damages awards \noutside the product liability context.\n  Perhaps what is by far the most important factor to keep in mind, \nhowever, is that excessive punitive damage awards have a harmful effect \nregardless of the number of reported cases on punitive damages. The \nnumber of reported cases bears no relationship to the detrimental \nimpact of punitive damages because most cases are settled before trial. \nA mere demand for punitive damages in a case raises the settlement \nvalue of the underlying case and delay settlement.\n  The end result is that plaintiffs' trial lawyers begin to include \nexorbitant requests for punitive damages in the most routine cases. \nData presented to the Judiciary Committee by Prof. George Priest, of \nYale Law School, showed that in certain counties in Alabama between 70 \nand 80 percent of all tort cases filed include a claim for punitive \ndamages. Unfortunately, using punitive damage claims as a threat in \nlitigation is incredibly commonplace.\n  The allegation of punitive damages makes settlement nearly impossible \nbecause it is difficult to place a value on the claim for punitive \ndamages. It also makes the prospect of a huge loss a real risk for \ndefendants. That artificially inflates the cost of settlement.\n  Further, liability insurance costs in turn must rise. The bottom line \nis that these costs are passed on through the economic system, where \nconsumers and workers ultimately pay the price. That occurs regardless \nof the precise number of punitive damage awards that juries in fact \ngranted in any particular period.\n  I also urge my colleagues to support Senator DeWine's amendment to \noffer small businesses some further protection against punitive \ndamages. In my view, small businesses are the engine that drive our \neconomy and provide much of our new employment opportunities. They \ntruly deserve our support. Many small business owners are forced to \nlive in constant fear of losing their entire investment and livelihood \nas a result of one lawsuit. That fear puts an enormous strain on their \nbusinesses, and more importantly, on the lives of their family members. \nThis amendment offers our small business some modest relief from \nabusive claims.\n  Finally, I had intended to offer an amendment concerning the \nimportant issue of multiple punitive damage awards. I will pursue that \nissue on another day.\n                 the multiple punitive damages problem\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss one of the most \nserious problems facing our civil justice system today--the imposition \nof multiple punitive damage awards against a party for the same act or \ncourse of conduct. The multiple imposition of punitive damages is \nsimply unfair and undermines the public's confidence in our system of \ncivil justice. Earlier this year, I introduced the Multiple Punitive \nDamages Fairness Act, S. 671, which addresses the fundamental \nunfairness of a system that allows a person to be sued again and again, \nsometimes in different States, for the same wrongful act. I had \nintended to offer the substance of my legislation as an amendment to \nthe Products Liability Act, but have decided to withhold my amendment \nat this time.\n  Punitive damages, as we are all aware, are not awarded to compensate \na victim of wrongdoing. These damages constitute punishment and an \neffort to deter future egregious misconduct. Punitive damage reform is \nnot about shielding wrongdoers from liability, nor does the multiples \nbill prevent victims of wrongdoing from being rightfully compensated \nfor their damages.\n  The people of Utah and the rest of the Nation have known for a long \ntime that our system of awarding punitive damages is broken and in need \nof repair. State and Federal judges have repeatedly called upon the \nCongress to address this important issue. The American Bar Association \nHouse of Delegates, in a resolution approved in 1987, called for \nappropriate safeguards to prevent punitive damages awards ``that are \nexcessive in the aggregate for the same wrongful act.'' Although their \nrecommendation suggests this action should be taken at the State level, \nthere is no practical way to implement meaningful reform addressing \nmultiple awards at the State level. The multiple imposition of punitive \ndamages is one area where a Federal response is clearly justified.\n  Likewise, the American College of Trial Lawyers, a group comprised of \nboth plaintiff and defense counsel, in a strongly worded report on \npunitive damages discussed the problems associated with the multiple \nimposition of punitive damages for both plaintiff and defense counsel. \nThey wrote:\n\n       From the Defendant's standpoint, there is a very real \n     possibility that the punitive awards will be duplicative and \n     therefore result in punishing the defendant more than once \n     for the same wrongful conduct. This obviously offends basic \n     notions of justice. Conversely, a plaintiff runs the risk \n     that prior awards may exhaust the defendant's resources, and \n     that, not only will there be insufficient funds from which to \n     pay the plaintiff's punitive award, but the funds will be \n     inadequate to pay a compensatory award.\n\n  More recently, Judge William Schwarzer, Director of the Federal \nJudicial Center, wrote abut the problems with multiple punitive \ndamages. He concluded: ``Congress needs to adopt legislation that \ncreates a national solution, invoking its power over commerce. The \nrepeated imposition of punitive damages for the same act or series on a \nfirm engaged in interstate commerce surely constitutes a burden on \ninterstate commerce.''\n  [[Page S6042]] Let me be very clear about what this amendment does. \nThis amendment does not in any way affect a person's ability to be \nfully compensated for their economic and noneconomic damages. A \nplaintiff remains entirely able to recover their full compensatory \ndamages if this amendment is enacted. Likewise, this amendment does not \nin any way limit the amount of punitive damages that may be awarded \nagainst a defendant.\n  Judge Friendly, a highly respected circuit court judge, first \nrecognized the difficulties of the multiple imposition of punitive \ndamages in several States in a 1967 opinion, Roginsky v. Richardson-\nMerrell, [378 F.2d 832 (2nd Cir.)] where he wrote:\n\n       The legal difficulties engendered by claims for punitive \n     damages on the part of hundreds of plaintiffs are staggering. \n     If all recovered punitive damages in the amount here awarded \n     these would run into the tens of millions. . . . We have the \n     gravest difficulty in perceiving how claims for punitive \n     damages in such a multiplicity of actions throughout the \n     nation can be so administered as to avoid overkill.\n\n  My amendment goes to the heart of the fundamental unfairness so \neloquently described by Judge Friendly.\n  The defendant and consumers are not the only ones hurt by excessive, \nmultiple punitive damage awards. Ironically, other victims that the \nsystem is supposedly intended to protect, may be most seriously \nimpacted by multiple punitive damage awards that precede their case. \nFunds that might otherwise be available to compensate them for their \ncompensatory damages can be wiped out at any early stage by excessive \npunitive damage awards.\n  As mentioned, safeguards are needed to protect these later victims \nagainst the abuses inherent in the early award of multiple punitive \ndamages. The conflict between current litigants seeking punitive \ndamages and potential litigants seeking merely compensatory damages was \naddressed in a recent case, Edwards v. Armstrong World Industries, [911 \nF.2d 1151 (5th Cir. 1990)]. In that case, the court reluctantly \naffirmed a lower court decision awarding punitive damages explained its \nmisgivings in the decision:\n\n       If no change occurs in our tort or constitutional law, the \n     time will arrive when Celotex's liability for punitive \n     damages imperils its ability to pay compensatory claims and \n     its corporate existence. Neither the company's innocent \n     shareholders, employees and creditors, nor future asbestos \n     claimants will benefit from this death by attrition.\n\n  Incidently, just 1 month after Judge Jones wrote those words, \nCelotex, already liable for $33 million in punitive damages, and faced \nwith a potential quarter of a billion dollars in additional punitive \ndamages as the result of an ongoing trial involving 3,000 additional \nclaims, in which it had been decided that punitive damages would be \ncalculated at two times the amount of compensatory damages, Celotex \nfiled for bankruptcy protection under chapter 11, where it remains \ntoday.\n  Let me give another example that illustrate several of the concerns \nwith multiple punitive damages. The Keene Corp. also illustrates how a \ncompany can be hit with so many punitive damage suits that they \neventually declare bankruptcy.\n  In the late 1960's, the Keene Corp. purchased a subsidiary company \nfor $8 million. Unfortunately, the subsidiary had made thermal \ninsulation that contained about 10 percent asbestos. When the asbestos \ndanger came to light in 1972, Keene closed the subsidiary. The company \nhas only sold about $15 million in products while they owned the \nsubsidiary.\n  From 1972 onward, Keene has had 50 punitive damage verdicts returned \nagainst it. Most of these verdicts involve claimants who were exposed \nto asbestos 25 years before the Keene Corp. was formed. The Keene Corp. \nhas paid out over $530 million in damages as a result of that purchase, \nmuch of it to lawyers, and it still faces numerous lawsuits.\n  Ultimately, Keene was forced into bankruptcy just last year. And, as \na result, victims who might have been entitled to receive compensatory \ndamages may be left out in the cold. Keene filed papers in every case \nthat asked for punitive damages, calling on the courts to disallow \nfurther awards since they no longer served any deterrence value or \npublic policy purpose.\n  Obviously, the multiple imposition of punitive damages for Keene's \nwrongful conduct served no legitimate purpose. The company had already \nstopped selling the alleged harmful product and the $530 million paid \nout in damages was surely a sufficient punishment and deterrent.\n  This imposition of multiple punitive damages awards in different \nStates for the same act is an issue that can only be addressed through \nFederal legislation and, thus, necessitates a congressional response. \nState and Federal judges have no authority to address the clear \ninequities confronting these defendants. In Juzwin v. Amtorg Trading \nCorp., [718 F. Supp. 1233, 1235 (D.N.J. 1989)], the court vacated its \nearlier order striking, on due process grounds, the multiple imposition \nof punitive damages. In arriving at this decision the court noted:\n\n       [T]his court does not have the power or the authority to \n     prohibit subsequent awards in other courts. . . . Until there \n     is uniformity either through Supreme court decision or \n     national legislation this court is powerless to fashion a \n     remedy which will protect the due process rights of this \n     defendant or other defendants similarly situated.\n\n  Let me remind my colleagues that it is the courts, and not just \nprivate interests, that are calling for reform of multiple punitive \ndamages.\n  My legislation addresses precisely the problems inherent in a system \nthat allows every State to punish a defendant separately for the same \nwrongful act or conduct. More important, it is straightforward and \nsimple. The legislation prohibits the award of multiple punitive \ndamages based on the same act or course of conduct for which punitive \ndamages have already been awarded against the same defendant.\n  This legislation also allows some flexibility. It allows some \ndiscretion to the court to allow subsequent cases to proceed to the \njury on the issue of punitive damages, if there is new and substantial \nevidence that justifies the imposition of additional such damages, or \nif the first award was inadequate to punish and deter the defendant or \nothers.\n  Under the first exception, if the court determines in a pretrial \nhearing that the claimant will offer new and substantial evidence of \npreviously undiscovered, additional wrongful behavior arising out of \nthe same course of conduct on the part of the defendant, other than \ninjury to the claimant, the court may let the jury decide to award \npunitive damages.\n  The second exception included in this amendment was not contained in \nS. 671. This exception gives the court discretion to determine in a \npre-trial proceeding whether the amount of punitive damages previously \nimposed, was insufficient to either punish the defendant's wrongful \nconduct or to deter the defendant or others from similar behavior in \nthe future. If, after a hearing, the court makes specific finding that \nthe damages previously imposed were not sufficient to punish or deter \nthe defendant or others, the court may permit the jury to make an \nadditional award of punitive damages. In both instances, the judge will \ndeduct the amount of the prior award from the award in this subsequent \ncase.\n  Moreover, my legislation will not preempt State law where a State \nprescribes the precise amount of punitive damages to be awarded. Thus, \nif a State desires to fix the amount of punitive damages for a specific \negregious act, they may do so under my amendment. Likewise if a State \ndesires to make an award of punitive damages proportional to the \ncompensatory damages awarded, they may do so through State legislation. \nThis provision is intended to preserve the discretion of States to \nlegislate on this aspect of punitive damages in this limited fashion.\n  Finally, my legislation makes it clear that a defendant's act \nincludes a single wrongful action or a course of conduct by the \ndefendant affecting a number of persons. In applying this act, the \nphrase ``act or course of conduct'' should be interpreted consist6ent \nwith our legislative objective of eliminating multiple punishment for \nwhat is essentially the same wrongful behavior.\n  I have looked at the problem of multiple punitive damages for some \ntime and have concluded that a federal response is the only way of \neffectively addressing this issue. My legislation is a small step in \naddressing the larger problem of excessive punitive damages, \n[[Page S6043]] but a needed beginning. I hope Senators join me in \nsupporting this important legislation. It allows the unfettered \nimposition of punitive damages by a jury to punish and deter those who \noffend our community. However, with limited exception, we punish the \ndefendant only once for his misconduct. I believe this is a fair way to \nproceed on this issue.\n  Mr. HEFLIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Hutchison). The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. HEFLIN. Madam President, how much time is remaining on our side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Eleven minutes.\n  Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. HEFLIN. Madam President, again, let me address some of the things \nthat I think have escaped the attention of people--the \ninterrelationship with the Dole amendment and the underlying bill, the \nunderlying Gorton substitute--which deal with the issue pertaining to \nthe calculation on each defendant of the noneconomic damages, and then \nits relationship to the Snowe amendment which basically sets the cap on \npunitive damages at twice the noneconomic damages, and the economic \ndamages.\n  The underlying bill and the Dole amendment provide for a bifurcated \ntrial--that is, two--where punitive damages are sought. If punitive \ndamages are sought, then any--and I read from the Dole amendment, which \nis the exact language as in the bill --\n\n       . . . evidence relative only to punitive damages as \n     determined by applicable State law shall be inadmissible in \n     any proceedings to determine whether compensatory damages are \n     to be awarded.\n\n  Compensatory damages include noneconomic damages so therefore you \ncannot prove gross negligence; you cannot prove recklessness; you \ncannot prove wantonness; you cannot prove intentional conduct \npertaining to the compensatory damage trial. The Dole amendment \nincludes all civil actions, including automobile accidents that I \ntalked about. It would also include this matter of the issue pertaining \nto rental cars.\n  Take, for example, a company decides there is need of a recall of \ncertain cars, and therefore in the recall of those cars there is an \nimmediate danger. But they continue to lease those cars. Then, in \neffect, you could not prove it where you sought also punitive damages.\n  Now, the noneconomic damages as it relates to section 109, which is \nseveral liability for noneconomic damages, provides, and I read:\n\n       Each defendant shall be liable only for the amount of \n     noneconomic loss allocated to defendant in direct proportion \n     to the percentage of responsibility.\n\n  For the harm, in other words, the percentage of fault. Therefore, if \nyou seek punitive damages, then under the underlying bill and the Dole \nbill, you cannot prove in the compensatory damage lawsuit in the trial \nin chief those elements of fault which constitute elements that would \ngo to the proof of punitive damages. You are precluded. It is \ninadmissible.\n  So how can you prove the percentage of fault that may rest on \ndefendants that have been guilty of punitive damage conduct, \nwantonness, conscious, flagrant indifference? How can you prove that \nand how can there be any logical sense way of determining what the \nnoneconomic loss is? And in its relationship here, it makes it an \nimpossibility. Therefore, when it comes to the case, as I pointed out, \nof a motor vehicle, where the company knew that the man had been \nconvicted of four drunk driving charges, two reckless driving charges, \nand they continued to allow him to operate and drive trucks, you could \nnot prove any of that in the case in chief. Therefore, you could not go \ntoward the establishment of the percentage of harm of noneconomic \ndamages towards that defendant.\n  And then in the punitive damages, it can only be twice the amount \nthat might be allocated to him in the overall situation.\n  So it seems to me that the relationship of this and the punitive \ndamages, particularly with the Snowe amendment really, have so many \nconsequences. I have just thought of a few. There are a multitude of \nconsequences that occur relative to this matter.\n  So I wish to point out that this is a situation which ought to be \ncarefully considered, and I just do not believe even the authors of the \nbill and the authors of the Snowe amendment recognize the dangers that \nthey are getting into relative to these matters.\n  How much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 3 minutes 40 seconds.\n  Mr. HEFLIN. I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mr. GORTON. How much time remains to my side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Eleven minutes 15 seconds.\n  Mr. GORTON. Madam President, we are discussing here several \namendments dealing with the concept of punitive damages in the court \nsystems of the United States, a healthy discussion, and it is one that \nI do not believe has been previously debated on the floor of the Senate \nin spite of the invitation to do so extended by the Supreme Court of \nthe United States.\n  Before we get into any of the details, I believe it important for \nMembers and for the public to understand the peculiar nature of \npunitive damages. Punitive damages by the very title are a form of \npunishment imposed by juries on defendants in civil litigation. All \nother forms of punishment under our judicial system come as a result of \ncriminal trials, in which case defendants have a wide range of \nconstitutional protections and very particularly have the benefit of a \nlimitation on punishments--a series of sentences set out by statutes \neither in specific terms or within ranges, together with the \nproposition that their guilt must be proven beyond a reasonable doubt. \nWith respect to punitive damages, not only is the standard of proof \nlower but there are literally no limits on the amount of punishment, \nthe fines, the damages, which can be imposed.\n  I must say that I find it peculiar that any Member of the Senate \ndefends such a system which presents to juries, without any guidance or \nany limitation whatsoever, the right on any basis whatsoever to award \nany amount of punitive damages whatsoever, without even the slightest \ndegree of relationship to the actual compensatory damages suffered by \nsuch a defendant. Over a century and a quarter ago, a judge in a New \nHampshire court said:\n\n       The idea is wrong. It is a monstrous heresy. It is an \n     unsightly and unhealthy excrescence deforming the symmetry of \n     the body of the law.\n\n  We might not use exactly that language today, Madam President, but I \nbelieve that my friend, the Senator from Nebraska, was entirely correct \nwhen he pointed out that his State and mine, lacking authority for \npunitive damages in civil cases, do not have discernibly more \nnegligent, more outrageous, more unreasonable people engaged in \nbusiness, whether that business is in making and selling products or in \nproviding nonprofit services. There simply is not any real indication \nthat this form of unlimited punishment has an actual impact on the \neconomy other than discouraging people from getting into business in \nthe first place, from developing and marketing new products, and other \nthan causing them to withdraw perfectly valid products from the \nmarketplace.\n  More recently, the Supreme Court of the United States has taken up \nthis issue itself and in effect has invited us to move into this field. \nThe majority opinion in a recent case, Pacific Mutual Life Insurance \nCompany versus Haislip, in 1990, says:\n\n       One must concede that unlimited jury discretion, or \n     unlimited judicial discretion for that matter, in fixing \n     punitive damages may invite extreme results that jar one's \n     constitutional sensibilities. \n  And that is exactly what the case is right now. These jar one's \nconstitutional sensibilities.\n  Justice O'Connor, in a dissent in that same case, said:\n\n       In my view, such instructions--Instructions that the jury \n     could do whatever it thinks best.\n\n     Are so fraught with uncertainty that they defy rational \n     implementation. Instead, they encourage inconsistent and \n     unpredictable results by inviting juries to rely on private \n     beliefs and personal predilections. Juries are permitted to \n     target unpopular defendants, penalize unorthodox or \n     controversial views, and redistribute wealth. Multimillion \n     dollar losses are inflicted on a whim. While I do not \n     question the general legitimacy of punitive \n     [[Page S6044]] damages, I see a strong need to constrain \n     juries with standards to restrain their discretion so that \n     they may exercise their power wisely, not capriciously or \n     maliciously. The Constitution requires as much.\n\n  Madam President, this bill does not abolish the concept of punitive \ndamages. It does, however, provide some limit on the sentences which \njuries can impose in the way of punitive damages--a sentence not to \nexceed twice the total amount of all of the economic and noneconomic \ndamages which the juries have already found. To me, that seems \neminently reasonable.\n  And I literally fail to understand why there is such a passionate \ndefense of a system of absolutely unlimited liability, absolutely \nunlimited punishment, in the American system.\n  One would think at the very least that the opponents would come up \nwith alternative standards upon which to make judgments with respect to \npunitive damages and other limits if they do not like the limits that \nare here. But we have one second-degree amendment before us that, once \nagain, says there are absolutely no limits, absolutely no limits. And \nthe opposition to the Dole amendment is that in every case which it \ncovers beyond those already covered by the bill there should continue \nto be absolutely no limits on punitive damages. Madam President, that \nis simply wrong.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. HOLLINGS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Straight to the point in the limited time available \nhere, Madam President, it is totally misleading to state that there is \nno test, to say that in criminal law, we have a test, but in civil \nlitigation, punitive damages, there is no test whatever.\n  To the contrary, there is a stipulation going right straight down the \nline of cases that, in awarding punitive damages, Madam President, you \nhave to look at the ability to pay. There is a listed group of tests \nthat are included. You have to look at the willfulness. These damages \nhave to be found on willful misconduct, and right on down the line.\n  I want to get right to the McDonald's case, when they say there is no \nlimit, that these punitive damages punish.\n  Then in that McDonald's case, I heard the foreman of that particular \njury in an interview say she thought it was a frivolous charge at first \nuntil they found out there were some 700 cases and that McDonald's had \ncost-factored out, on a cost-benefit basis, the hotter the coffee, the \nmore coffee you received out of the coffee bin. So they just wrote it \noff. They could keep taking the 700 claims and give third-degree burns \nover a sixth of the body and keep them 3 weeks in the hospital and \neverything else.\n  But punitive damages were awarded in that McDonald's case for $2.7 \nmillion. The court itself reduced it to $480,000.\n  There are limits in every jurisdiction. And punitive damages, if you \ngo right to the automobile cases, caused in the last 10 years \n72,254,931 cars to be recalled. That is wonderful safety on the \nhighways of America. Why? Because of punitive damages? It has been \nproved from the Pinto case on down in all of these automobile cases. \nHad it not been for the punitive damage portion of the award, none of \nthese would be recalled because the manufacturers could put it in the \ncost of the car.\n  We have garage door openers redesigned, we have cribs withdrawn, we \nhave Drano packaging redesigned, firefighters' respirators redesigned, \nRemington Mohawk rifles recalled, the production of harmful arthritis \ndrugs ceased, charcoal briquets properly labeled, steam vaporizers \nredesigned, heart valves no longer produced by Bjork-Shively, hazardous \nlawnmowers redesigned, hotel security strengthened, surgical equipment \nsafely redesigned. On and on down the list, punitive damages have \nproved their worth to society.\n  And to come now and say in criminal cases we have sentencing \nguidelines, but there are no guidelines whatever in punitive damages \ncases is totally misleading. In fact, they have gone to the U.S. \nSupreme Court and the U.S. Supreme Court has upheld in the several \nStates the punitive damages awards that have been made.\n  So we go right on down each one of the cases over and over again and \nagain and we find, for example, in the leading case to ensure that a \npunitive damage award is proper, one, the defendant's degree of \nculpability, which must be willful misconduct; two, duration of the \nconduct; three, defendant's awareness of concealment; four, the \nexistence of similar past conduct; five, likelihood the award will \ndeter the defendant or others from like conduct; six, whether the award \nis reasonably related to the harm likely to result.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington has 4 minutes and \n30 seconds remaining.\n  Mr. GORTON. Was not the order for voting at 11:15?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That was the original intent of the order. The \nSenator may yield back his time, if he wishes.\n  Mr. GORTON. This Senator can make one very, very brief comment. He \nfinds it curious that his friend from South Carolina, who is the \nleading member of his party and the former chairman of the Senate \nCommerce Committee, on which this Senator serves, and a cosponsor or a \nsupporter of all of the automobile safety legislation which has gone \nthrough that committee in the last 15 years, which is the primary cause \nof a greater safety, should ascribe all changes in safety to product \nliability litigation. If that is true, he and I have certainly been \nwasting our time on hearings on automobile safety and passing laws \nrespecting seat belts and air bags and side impact protection and the \nlike.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, will the Senator yield?\n  My amendment will be the first amendment voted on when we begin this \nseries of votes. I wonder if the Senator would yield 1 minute to me.\n  Mr. GORTON. Do I have a little bit more than a minute remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 2 minutes and 40 seconds \nremaining.\n  Mr. GORTON. I will finish this thought and I will yield the remainder \nof my time to the Senator from North Dakota.\n  In any event, even the Senator from South Carolina has not come up \nwith any parallel with respect to punitive damages and the criminal \ncode. In the criminal code, maximum sentences for all offenses right up \nto and including the most aggravated forms of murder are set out in the \nstatutes, ranges on which sentences can be imposed. With respect to \npunitive damages, there are no such limits. This proposal in its \npresent form has such limits tied logically enough to the amount of \ndamages which the person has actually suffered. This is the appropriate \nway to go.\n  I yield the remainder of my time to my friend from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. How much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota would have 1 \nminute and 40 seconds.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 619\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, the amendment that will be voted on \nimmediately following my 1 minute or so will be the amendment I offered \nthat strikes the limitation or the caps on punitive damages.\n  I want to explain why I offered this amendment. As I do so, let me \nsay is that I have supported the notion of product liability reform. I \nvoted for this bill coming out of the committee, although I had a \nproblem with this section. I likely will vote for this bill going out \nof the Senate with respect to product liability reform.\n  But the standard is that you must prove that a company, that there is \nclear and convincing evidence that the harm was carried out with a \nconscious, flagrant indifference of the safety of others. If you have \nproven that standard of a company that they moved forward with a \nconscious, flagrant indifference of the safety of others, why on Earth \nwould you want to put a cap on punitive damages?\n  The whole notion of punitive damages is to punish a company that \nwould do that. We have very few punitive damages awarded in this \ncountry. It is not a crisis. Yes, I think we should have some product \nliability reform, and I support that. But the bill last year that was \nbrought to the floor of \n[[Page S6045]] the Senate reforming the product liability laws had no \ncap on punitive damages; none at all. Now this year they bring a bill \nto the floor with this cap. This cap should be stricken.\n  I hope that Members of the Senate will support my amendment. Again, \nthe standard is conscious, flagrant indifference to the safety of \nothers. If a corporation or a company has demonstrated that, then we \nsay to them, ``By the way, when someone tries to punish you for \nconscious, flagrant indifference to the safety of others, we won't let \nthem punish you very much. We will put a cap on that.''\n  Why would we do that? That is absurd. That makes no sense. It was not \ndone last year; it should not be done this year.\n  I hope Members will support my amendment to strike that cap.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator from North Dakota has \nexpired.\n  Mr. GORTON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mr. GORTON. Madam President, has all time been utilized?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has expired.\n  Mr. GORTON. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that all votes \nin the stacked sequence, following the first vote, be reduced to 10 \nminutes in length.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GORTON. I also call for the regular order which would make the \nvoting sequence begin with the Dorgan amendment, with one exception.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the Shelby amendment be the last of the \nsecond-degree amendments to the Dole amendment considered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Mr. GORTON. What is the pending business, Madam President?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Amendment No. 619, the Dorgan amendment, will \nbe the first amendment to be voted on.\n  Mr. GORTON. Madam President, I move to table the Dorgan amendment and \nask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n\n\n               Vote on Motion to Table Amendment No. 619\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the motion to \nlay on the table amendment No. 619. The yeas and nays have been \nordered. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk called the roll.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Are there any other Senators in the Chamber \ndesiring to vote?\n  The result was announced--yeas 51, nays 49, as follows:\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 145 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--51\n\n     Abraham\n     Ashcroft\n     Bennett\n     Bond\n     Brown\n     Burns\n     Campbell\n     Chafee\n     Coats\n     Cochran\n     Coverdell\n     Craig\n     DeWine\n     Dole\n     Domenici\n     Exon\n     Faircloth\n     Frist\n     Gorton\n     Gramm\n     Grams\n     Grassley\n     Gregg\n     Hatch\n     Hatfield\n     Helms\n     Hutchison\n     Inhofe\n     Jeffords\n     Kassebaum\n     Kempthorne\n     Kyl\n     Lieberman\n     Lott\n     Lugar\n     Mack\n     McCain\n     McConnell\n     Moynihan\n     Murkowski\n     Nickles\n     Nunn\n     Pressler\n     Robb\n     Santorum\n     Smith\n     Snowe\n     Stevens\n     Thomas\n     Thurmond\n     Warner\n\n                                NAYS--49\n\n     Akaka\n     Baucus\n     Biden\n     Bingaman\n     Boxer\n     Bradley\n     Breaux\n     Bryan\n     Bumpers\n     Byrd\n     Cohen\n     Conrad\n     D'Amato\n     Daschle\n     Dodd\n     Dorgan\n     Feingold\n     Feinstein\n     Ford\n     Glenn\n     Graham\n     Harkin\n     Heflin\n     Hollings\n     Inouye\n     Johnston\n     Kennedy\n     Kerrey\n     Kerry\n     Kohl\n     Lautenberg\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Mikulski\n     Moseley-Braun\n     Murray\n     Packwood\n     Pell\n     Pryor\n     Reid\n     Rockefeller\n     Roth\n     Sarbanes\n     Shelby\n     Simon\n     Simpson\n     Specter\n     Thompson\n     Wellstone\n  So the motion to lay on the table the amendment (No. 619) was agreed \nto.\n  Mr. GORTON.

I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                       Vote on Amendment No. 622\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on amendment numbered 622, \noffered by the Senator from Ohio [Mr. DeWine].\n  Mr. GORTON. Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GORTON. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, the amendment I have offered with the \ndistinguished Senator from Ohio [Mr. DeWine], is extremely important \nfor small business owners across the country. This amendment protects \nsmall businesses and other small entities with 25 employees or less \nfrom excessive punitive damage awards over $250,000. Individuals, \nincluding small businesses organized as sole proprietors, whose net \nworth does not exceed $500,000 would also be protected.\n  Let me make it clear that small business owners support requiring \nsomeone to make restitution when they cause injuries. However, under \nour current liability structure businesses can be bankrupted by the \naddition of punitive damage awards that are vastly in excess of the \nbusiness' ability to pay. The result is fewer small businesses and lost \njob opportunities. Our amendment will not limit plaintiffs from \nreceiving full compensation for their economic and noneconomic damages.\n  Mr. President, this small business punitive cap amendment will be \nrated by the National Federation of Independent Business as a key small \nbusiness vote for the 104th Congress. This amendment is also strongly \nsupported by the 739,000 members of the National Restaurant \nAssociation. I ask unanimous consent that letters of endorsement by the \nNFIB and National Restaurant Association be printed in the Record. I \nyield the floor.\n  There being no objection, the letters were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                            National Federation of\n\n\n                                         Independent Business,\n\n                                      Washington, DC, May 2, 1995.\n     Hon. Spence Abraham,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Abraham: On behalf of the more than 600,000 \n     members of the National Federation of Independent Business \n     [NFIB], I commend you for offering an amendment that would \n     protect small business owners from excessive punitive damage \n     awards.\n       Small business owners support requiring someone to make \n     restitution when they cause injuries. However, our current \n     liability rules can mean that businesses can be bankrupted by \n     the addition of punitive damage awards that are vastly in \n     excess of the business' ability to pay. Because of the \n     potential for such an outcome, many small business owners \n     are, in effect, forced to settle out of court. This results \n     in higher insurance premiums, higher consumer prices, and \n     worst of all, increased disrespect for our legal system.\n       Your amendment does not mean that plaintiffs will not be \n     compensated; they will still be able to recover unlimited \n     economic and non-economic losses. It merely means that \n     punitive damage awards over and above actual restitution will \n     be capped at a level that permits many small businesses to \n     survive a lawsuit.\n       Thank you for offering this important common sense small \n     business amendment. Passage of your amendment along with the \n     underlying Dole amendment will be Key Small Business Votes \n     for the 104th Congress.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                           John J. Motley III,\n\n                                                   Vice President,\n     Federal Government Relations.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                              National Restaurant Association,\n\n                                      Washington, DC, May 3, 1995.\n     Hon. Spence Abraham,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Abraham: On behalf of the National Restaurant \n     Association and the 739,000 units the foodservice industry \n     represents, I want to express our support for your amendment \n     providing protection for small businesses from excessive \n     punitive damage awards.\n       In an industry dominated by small businesses--72% of all \n     eating and drinking establishments have sales of $500,000 per \n     year or less, and experience profit margins in the 3 to 5% \n     range--an excessive damage award can force a restaurant to \n     close its doors. This hurts not only the business owner and \n     his/her family, but the employees and their families as well.\n       Everyone agrees that citizens should have the right to sue \n     and collect reasonable compensation if they are wrongfully \n     injured. \n     [[Page S6046]] However, common sense legal reform is needed \n     to bring balance back into the system. Your efforts in this \n     regard are greatly appreciated.\n       Again, thank you for your efforts to protect America's \n     small businesses.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 Elaine Z. Graham,\n                              Senior Director, Government Affairs.\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I want to voice my support for two \namendments offered by Senator DeWine to S. 565 that were passed by \nvoice vote today. The first amendment places a $250,000 cap on the \namount of punitive damages that can be awarded against small businesses \nthat have a net worth of less than $500,000. The second amendment \nallows juries to consider a defendant's assets when determining the \nappropriate amount to award for punitive damages.\n  I oppose S. 565. I believe that this bill extends the reach of the \nFederal Government into an area that properly belongs to the States. \nAnd rather than slowing litigation, I believe S. 565 will create \nconfusion and therefore more litigation. Under this bill you will have \n50 different State courts interpreting the impact on this law on \nexisting State case and statutory law. It is a result that only the \nlawyers will benefit by.\n  At the same time, I recognize just how hard small businesses struggle \nto stay afloat. And, I am well aware that Montana law recognizes the \nneed to appreciate small business concerns. For example, Montana allows \nsmall companies to operate as ``limited liability'' companies. By doing \nthis, small companies are able to limit their liability exposure to the \namount of capital invested. Montana also requires to look at a \ndefendant's financial resources in determining punitive damages awards.\n  To the extent that we are going to enact Federal legislation \ngoverning certain aspects of tort law, I believe it is important to \ninclude provisions that are specifically targeted to small businesses. \nFor this reason, I support the DeWine amendments as offered.\n  Mr. GORTON. Madam President, this amendment and the next amendment \nhave been worked out by the two managers and can be agreed to by voice \nvote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment \nnumbered 622, offered by the Senator from Ohio [Mr. DeWine].\n  So the amendment (No. 622) was agreed to.\n  Mr. GORTON. Madam President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. BENNETT. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                       Vote on Amendment No. 623\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on amendment No. 623, offered \nby the Senator from Ohio [Mr. DeWine].\n  If there be no further debate, the question is on agreeing to the \namendment.\n  The amendment (No. 623) was agreed to.\n  Mr. GORTON. Madam President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n          Amendment No. 621, as modified, to Amendment No. 617\n\n  Mr. SHELBY. Madam President, I send to the desk a modification of the \namendment I have at the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the amendment is so \nmodified.\n  The amendment (No. 621), as modified, is as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place insert the following:\n\n     SEC.   . LIABILITY FOR CERTAIN CLAIMS RELATING TO DEATH.\n\n       In any civil action in which the alleged harm to the \n     claimant is death and, as of the effective date of this Act, \n     the applicable State law provides, or has been construed to \n     provide, for damages only punitive in nature, a defendant may \n     be liable for any such damages without regard to this \n     section, but only during such time as the State law so \n     provides.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mr. GORTON. Is the Shelby amendment now the pending business?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Shelby amendment as modified is the \npending business.\n  Mr. GORTON. Madam President, this is worked out with the two Senators \nfrom Alabama who are opponents to the bill but who nevertheless have a \nlegitimate question about a quirk in Alabama law. The amendment applies \nonly to certain cases in Alabama, and is acceptable.\n  THE PRESIDING OFFICER. If there be no further debate, the question is \non agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 621), as modified, was agreed to.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Madam President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. GORTON. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                 Vote On Amendment No. 617, As Amended\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on the Dole amendment, No. \n617, as amended.\n  Mr. GORTON. Has a rollcall been ordered?\n  Madam President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

But, Mr. President, with the cooperation of the other side of \nthe aisle, we will seek time agreements on future amendments and will \nhope to stack votes on any amendments which are ready to vote for \nsometime late in the afternoon so Members are not called back and forth \nwilly-nilly.\n  While we look for that and wait for the Senator from Tennessee, I \nsuggest the absence of a quorum.\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, we could not understand the distinguished \nSenator from Washington. May we have order?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. We will have order in the Senate. The Senator \nis exactly right.\n  Will the Senator repeat his statement?\n  Mr. GORTON. Under the previous order, the Senator from Tennessee, who \nis now present, has the right to offer the next amendment. I was \nsuggesting that we attempt to get time agreements on as many amendments \nas possible in the future, but at the same time, to stack votes for \nsometime later \n[[Page S6047]] this afternoon, if it is possible to do so, so that \nagain we can bring Members here for votes, perhaps more than one vote, \nbut not interrupt their schedules every hour or so.\n  Mr. HEFLIN. Mr. President, might I say, before we agree to that, we \nwould have to see what the amendments are.\n  Mr. GORTON. I fully agree. This is simply a suggestion. I hope it \nwill work. If it does not, we will proceed to the regular order.\n  Mr. President, I see the Senator from Tennessee is present. I yield \nthe floor.\n  Mr. THOMPSON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the order, the Senator from Tennessee \nhas the floor.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. Thank you, Mr. President.\n\n\n                 Amendment No. 618 to Amendment No. 596\n\n (Purpose: To limit the applicability of the uniform product liability \n   provisions to actions brought in a Federal court under diversity \n                             jurisdiction)\n\n  Mr. THOMPSON. Mr. President, I call up an amendment numbered 618, \nwhich is at the desk, and I ask for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Tennessee [Mr. Thompson] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 618 to amendment No. 596.\n\n  Mr. THOMPSON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       In section 102(a)(1), after ``commenced'' insert the \n     following: ``in a Federal court pursuant to section 1332 of \n     title 28, United States Code, or removed to a Federal court \n     pursuant to chapter 89 of such title''.\n       In section 102(c)(6), strike ``or'' at the end.\n       In section 102(c)(7), strike the period at the end and \n     insert ``; or''.\n       In section 102(c), add the following new paragraph:\n       (8) create a cause of action or provide for jurisdiction by \n     a Federal Court under section 1331 or 1337 of title 28, \n     United States Code, that otherwise would not exist under \n     applicable Federal or State law.\n\n  Mr. THOMPSON. Mr. President, we are now engaged in a national debate \non an issue that is important to the future of this country. The issue \nbefore us essentially is should the U.S. Congress federalize certain \nportions of our judicial system that, up until now, have been under the \nprovince of the States? And, if so, should we make major changes or \nmore modest ones?\n  I cannot think of a more important subject for us to consider than \nour system of justice. The judicial system is a bedrock of our free \nsociety. It must be fair. It must be perceived to be fair. Our citizens \nmust have confidence in it. As we continue our deliberations, we must \ndo so with the purpose in mind of striving for a system that is most \nlikely to achieve justice in most cases. It is serious business, and \nour decisions should not depend upon whose favorite ox is being gored \nat the moment.\n  At the outset, I must say that we could do this process a service by \nrefocusing the terms of this debate. It seems that we have in large \npart gotten off to a somewhat rocky start, and have been spending too \nmuch time arguing about which side is the most greedy and which side \nhas contributed the most to which party's political campaigns.\n  Most of the literature, most of the press, and a lot of the \nconversation has had to do with those subjects, and it is an all-too-\neasy refuge for those who really do not understand the issues or who do \nnot care and are simply trying to win the debate.\n  As far as the debate going on between the private interests of each \nside of this legislative battle, I have not noticed that either side is \ngoing against its own economic interest.\n  They are all sophisticated and well financed.\n  It seems that nowadays the debate on important issues is going the \nway of political campaigns: concentrating on grossly distorted \nanecdotes, sound bites, and 30-second commercials designed to appeal to \nignorance and emotion. That is fine for the contestants in this matter \nto engage in if they choose to do so, but this body has a duty and a \ndifferent function.\n  First, we need to address the issue of federalism. At the outset, I \nmust state that I have great concern with any proposal that imposes a \nFederal standard in an area that has been left up to the States for 200 \nyears. I would remind many of my Republican brethren that we ran for \noffice and were elected last year on the basis of our strong belief \nthat the government that is closest to the people is the best \ngovernment; that Washington does not always know best; that more \nresponsibility should be given to the States because that is where most \nof the creative ideas and innovations are happening. Whether it be \nunfunded mandates, welfare reform, or regulations that are strangling \nproductivity, we took the stand that States and local governments \nshould have a greater say about how people's lives are going to be run, \nand the Federal Government less.\n  People have different notions about the importance of philosophical \nconsistency. But let there be no mistake about what we are doing if by \nlegislative fiat we usurp significant areas of State tort law, passed \nby State legislators, elected in their own communities. We are going \nagainst the very fundamentals of our own philosophy which has served as \nour yardstick by which we measure all legislation.\n  In the Contract With America, every provision, in one way or another, \nhas to do with limiting the power or authority of the Federal \nGovernment or one of its branches with regard to the States or \nindividuals except one: the change in the legal system. That provision \nhas nothing to do with limiting or changing the rules with regard to \nthe Federal Government--but, rather, with the Federal Government \nchanging the rules between two private parties, the very thing we have \nbeen so critical of in the past. I would say to my friends who are \nconservative in all matters except this one: If and when we are no \nlonger in the majority, we will stand naked against our opponents as \nthey rewrite our tort law for America to fit their wishes and \nconstituencies because we will have lost the philosophical high ground.\n  It is ironic that all of this is occurring at a time when the \nphilosophical battle that we have been fighting for so many years is \nfinally being won. Several recent Federal court decisions, including \nthe recent Supreme Court decision in the Lopez case, have finally begun \nto place some restrictions on Congress' use of the commerce clause to \nregulate every aspect of American life. Conservatives have been \ncomplaining for years that congressional expansion into all areas, with \nthe acquiescence of the Federal courts, has resulted in rendering the \nrestrictions of the commerce clause meaningless. Now the courts have \nlet Congress know that there are limitations to Congress' authority to \nlegislate in areas only remotely connected to interstate commerce. And \nyet as we won the war, we take the enemy's position. We are now the \nones who seek to legislate and regulate medical procedure in every \ndoctor's office in every small town in America. And we are the ones who \nnow seek to legislate and regulate the fee structure between a lawyer \nand his client in any small town in America.\n  It is not as if the States have abdicated their responsibilities in \nthis area. Many States have tougher and more restrictive laws than \nthose advocated before this body.\n  Four States have no punitive damages. Some States have caps on \npunitive damages. Most States have gone from a preponderance of the \nevidence standard to a clear and convincing standard for punitives. My \nown State of Tennessee has a 10-year statute of repose while the \nproducts bill before us allows 20 years. And as was recently pointed \nout by the National Conference of State Legislatures, ``Each of the 50 \nState legislatures, many configures by a fresh influence of Republican \ntort reformers, is considering some type of overhaul of the legal \nsystem.''\n  It is not as if State legislatures wish to be relieved of the burden \nof dealing with the subject of tort reform. As the president of the \nNational Conference of State Legislatures recently said:\n\n       As you know, NCSL regards the unjustified preemption of \n     State law as a serious issue of federalism, comparable in \n     many ways to the issue of Federal mandates. Federal mandates \n     erode the fiscal autonomy of States, while Federal preemption \n     erodes the legal and regulatory authority of States. Every \n     year Federal legislation, regulations, and court decisions \n     preempt additional areas of State law, steadily shrinking the \n     jurisdiction of State legislatures.\n       [[Page S6048]] NCSL opposes Federal preemption of State \n     product liability law, strictly on federalism grounds. Tort \n     law traditionally has been a State responsibility, and the \n     imposition of Federal products standards into the complex \n     context of State tort law would create confusion in State \n     courts. Without imposing one-size-fits all Federal standards, \n     States may act on their own initiative to reform product \n     liability law in ways that are tailored to meet their \n     particular needs and that fit into the context of existing \n     State law.\n\n  However, we are told that, while all of the above may be true, the \nsystem has totally gotten out of hand. It is said that our Nation is \nsmothering under an avalanche of litigation and frivolous lawsuits; \nthat our legal system is nothing more than a lottery system and that \nthe lawyers are the only ones who really win the lottery. Well let us \nexamine all of that.\n  In the first place, I want to say that in any system run by human \nbeings there are going to be abuses and miscarriages of justice and our \nlegal system is no exception. For example, there is no question but \nthat some frivolous lawsuits are filed. However, it should be \nunderstood by the American public there is not one thing about any of \nthe substantive legislative proposals we have considered or will \nconsider that will in any way diminish the possibility of frivolous law \nsuits. No proponent of reform will argue that there is. There is simply \nno way to prejudge a case before it is filed. What we can do and should \ndo is impose a penalty upon the litigants and the lawyers once a court \nhas determined that a lawsuit is frivolous. The Brown amendment, which \nstrengthened rule 11 in Federal cases, does that. I voted for it, and I \nhope it finds its way into any legislation that is finally adopted.\n  Also, I am convinced that some industries in some States are being \nhit especially hard. I am very sympathetic to those that produce \nproducts or render professional services, that provide jobs for working \npeople, and that make the wheels go around in our economy. That is why \nI am working to help relieve the burden of regulation that they face \nand the tax burden that too often penalizes investment and \nproductivity.\n  My own personal opinion is that the number of lawsuits brought in \nthis country is too high and that it is a reflection of more serious \nthings going on in our society.\n  However, nothing in the proposed legislation would cut down on the \nnumber of lawsuits, and I do not think anyone believes that it is \nCongress' role to place a quota on the number of lawsuits that can be \nfiled in this country.\n  We have reached a point where a lot of people would support any \nlegislation if they thought it would hurt lawyers. And there is no \nquestion that lawyers are often times their own worst enemy. My own \nopinion is that the profession has become too much\n like a business, too bottom line oriented, that lawyer advertising has \nhurt the profession that some of the fees being reported from Wall \nStreet and other places over the last decade or so have caused the \npublic's regard for the legal profession to fall dramatically. Frankly \nthat is something that the U.S. Congress should be able to appreciate. \nSo we have an imperfect system in an imperfect world.\n\n  However, there is another side to the story. The fact of the matter \nis that all things considered, the system has served up pretty well for \na long period of time. Our State tort system has provided us with a \nform of free market regulation. Goals like achieving product safety are \nreached without additional and intrusive government mandates that other \ncountries have imposed as a substitute for a tort-based compensation \nsystem.\n  Also, in the State courts during 1992, all tort cases amounted to 9 \npercent of the total civil case load. In the Federal courts, product \nliability claims declined by 36 percent between 1985 and 1991, when one \nexcludes the unique case of asbestos. Since 1990, the national total of \nState tort filings has decreased by 2 percent. If this trend continues \nin the next 10 years, State courts will experience a decline of 10 \npercent in State tort filings. As a matter of fact, the primary cause \nof the surge in litigation in Federal courts has been disputes between \nbusinesses. Contract cases, which make up only one type of all \ncommercial litigation, have increased by 232 percent over the period of \n1960 through 1988.\n  And there is a lot going on that does not meet the eye that has to do \nwith self regulation in a free society. Every day all over the country \nlawyers are telling clients that they do not have a winnable case, or \nthat, although they have a pretty good case, the expense involved is \nnot worth the potential recovery. You see, lawyers do not make money on \nfrivolous lawsuits. Insurance companies learned a long time ago that \npaying off on frivolous cases in order to avoid potential litigation \nexpense does not pay off. And the plaintiff lawyers know that the \ninsurance companies will not pay extortion.\n  Also going on every day in this country are cases which are settled \nwhere a person was wrongfully injured and received a reasonable amount \nof compensation. That is most cases. They do not make the newspapers.\n  Also going on every day in this country are decisions by insurance \ncompanies not to settle with the plaintiff even though he is clearly \nentitled the recovery because he is a little guy and stretching it out \nfor a couple of years and causing his lawyer to have to bear the burden \nfinancing the depositions and other expenses will make the plaintiff \nand his lawyer more amenable to a lower settlement later on. Besides, \nthey know that they can put the settlement money to good use for that \n2-year period and make money on that money. On balance, it more than \nmakes up for their own attorneys' fees.\n  Also, going on quite often, are situations where a large corporate \ndefendant is caught having committed outrageous conduct which resulted \nin tremendous injuries to innocent people. Often these cases are \nsettled even before suit is filed because the plaintiffs do not want to \ngo through a lawsuit and defendants know what might be in store for \nthem if the plaintiffs get a mean lawyer who knows what he is doing.\n  This is the real world. This is the rest of the iceberg of our legal \nsystem that most people do not see. It is free market, give and take, \nsometimes rough and tumble, and sometimes produces injustices. But we \nhave always believed in America that, with all its faults, the best way \nto resolve disputes is not at 20 paces but with a jury from the local \ncommunity who hears all the facts and listens to all the witness and \nwho is in the best position of anybody in America to decide what is \njustice in any particular case. Then you have a judge who passes on \nwhat the jury did and then you have at least one level of appeal to \npass on what the judge did. And I can assure you--and anybody who has \never been there knows this--that you do not find much run-away emotion \nleft by the time you get to the appellate level in most State courts.\n  So if we are determined to ring out the injustices that slip through \nthe State system here at the Federal level, what are we going to \nreplace it with?\n  What are we going to replace it with? A one-size-fits-all standard? \nOne standard that would apply to mom and pop and to General Motors? One \nstandard that would cover both the frivolous lawsuit and the lawsuits \ninvolving gross misconduct by the defendant? In our haste to correct \none problem, are we not running the danger of creating greater \nproblems?\n  Let me give you another example from real life. A lot of people are \nconcerned about frivolous lawsuits against the medical profession. I \nshare that concern. There have been good physicians wrongfully sued in \nthis country. I think the system pretty well takes care of the problem \nin the end, but I regret that they have to go through that process. I \nam sure most of them were very displeased with me--my good friend and \nhis supporters--when I could not go along with a $250,000 punitive cap \non their exposure. I wish I could have gone along with it. But I could \nnot. Because, not only do I have grave reservations about Congress \nlegislating in this area, but in addition, the same cap that would \nlegitimately and properly help them in some cases would unfairly hurt \nothers in other cases. That is the problem with the one-size-fits all \napproach in Washington.\n  Let me tell you a little story. David and Tammy Travis from \nNashville, TN, came to see me last Wednesday, April 26. They have been \nfollowing this debate and they wanted to tell me about their daughter \nAmanda. Amanda was a 5-year-old girl who was scheduled to \n[[Page S6049]] have a routine tonsillectomy at a medical clinic in \nNashville. Amanda arrived at the clinic at 6 a.m. A nurse, not an \nanesthesiologist, administered the anesthesia and he administered the \nwrong anesthesia. Also, Amanda was hooked up to the wrong intravenous \nsolution, as well.\n  The errors continued as Amanda was given demerol even though she was \nnot complaining and was not even awake. When Amanda began throwing up \nblood, the nurse informed the family that this was normal. By 2 o'clock \nthat afternoon Amanda was lethargic. The nurse told\n the family that a doctor wanted to keep Amanda overnight, which was \nrepresented to be normal. However, the nurse had not contacted the \ndoctor and had made that decision herself.\n\n  Later in the afternoon, Amanda could not breathe. The short-staffed \nhospital had only a nurse and a sitter on duty. In fact, the nurse who \nadministered the anesthesia was a drug addict, who subsequently died of \nan overdose while preparing to go into an operating room for another \npatient. The clinic had known that the nurse had this drug problem.\n  When Amanda was hooked up to emergency equipment, her head blew up \nlike a balloon, and she began to bleed out of her mouth, as her father \nused his handkerchief to try to stop the flow. The nurse ran off to get \nmore equipment to open the airways. By this point, Amanda was getting \nso little oxygen that Mrs. Travis pleaded that 911 be called. Someone \nat the clinic did call 911 and the paramedics rushed Amanda to \nVanderbilt Hospital. By this point, Amanda was essentially dead, \nalthough the paramedics did their best to revive her.\n  After Amanda died, her parents were not given timely copies of her \nrecords from the clinic. Amanda's parents did, however, obtain the \nrecords from Vanderbilt. When they received the clinic's records, it \nwas obvious that the clinic had altered the records to cover up their \nerrors. The clinic tried to make it look like Amanda had been fine when \nshe left the clinic, and that it was the paramedics who had messed up.\n  The case went to trial about 2 years after the lawsuit was brought. \nThe Travises are people of modest means. Their lawyer, Randy Kinnard of \nNashville, financed 48 depositions and other expenses out of his own \npocket over the 2-year period. The case was settled during trial for $3 \nmillion, an amount that reflected the clear liability of the clinic and \navailability of punitive damages. The lawyer's fee, incidentally, was \n30 percent.\n  The Travises traveled to Washington with their story even though Mrs. \nTravis was under doctor's orders not to travel as a result of recent \nknee surgery. They came to my office with Mrs. Travis in a wheelchair. \nThe Travises have no further financial interest in any of this \nlegislation. They simply want to ask me to try to help make sure that \nwe did not do anything up here that would make it more likely that \nother parents would lose their little girls the way they did; that we \ndid not do anything to make it more economically feasible for hospitals \nor large companies to hire on the cheap or to cut corners.\n  The question presented to me is whether or not I am going to be a \npart of a process that tells Tennesseans that they cannot award this \nfamily $3 million if a jury in Tennessee, after hearing all the \nevidence, gives them that amount, or a company, realizing that they are \nfinally at the bar of justice, coughs up that amount. I will not be a \nparty to that.\n  We had another situation in Hardeman County in rural west Tennessee a \nfew years ago that is instructive. A chemical company contaminated the \nregion's groundwater. Residents exhibited various forms of disease: \ncancer, liver damage, kidney, skin, eye and stomach ailments, and \nnervous, immune, and reproductive system disorders. The jury found the \nchemical company had knowingly and recklessly dumped the chemical waste \nat its landfill site, failed to make the dumping site leakproof, \ndisregarded the warnings of contamination by one of its own senior \nemployees, failed to warn residents or government officials of the \ndangers, and attempted to cover up evidence when an investigation was \ninitiated. Residents of Hardeman County recovered $5.3 million in \ncompensatory damages and $7.5 million in punitive damages. Do I think \nthat Congress should tell Tennesseans that they cannot allow the jury \nwho heard the case to award those damages? I do not.\n  I get the feeling that there are cross currents running through the \nSenate at this point in our deliberations. I believe that there is a \nstrong and understandable feeling that we should pass some tort reform \nmeasure in this session of Congress. I think, however, that there is \nanother feeling that we are not quite sure of what we ought to pass and \nwe fear that we do not fully appreciate or understand the effect of \nwhat we may be about to do.\n  It seems to me that the responsible thing to do is to take a second \nand harder look at the proposals before us and try to respond to a \nlegitimate Federal interest while resisting the temptation to \nfederalize 200 years of State law that has undergone substantial reform \nand is still being reformed as we deliberate. I suggest that because of \nthe interstate nature of the activity that there is a legitimate \nFederal interest in the products liability laws of this Nation. \nApproximately 70 percent of all manufactured goods in this country \ntravel in interstate commerce. I believe that this is one area under \nconsideration that would pass the commerce clause test. Furthermore, \nnot only do the products travel in interstate commerce but the \nlitigants in product litigation are often also\n interstate in nature in that they are citizens of States different \nthan that of the manufacture, thereby creating diversity jurisdiction, \nand are able to avail themselves of the Federal court system. \nTherefore, it would seem reasonable to legislate in an area involving \ninterstate commerce with regard to litigation involving our Federal \ncourt system.\n\n  Therefore, I am offering on behalf of myself, Senator Cochran, and \nSenator Simon an amendment to limit the bill's application to cases in \nFederal court. If my amendment were adopted, and a plaintiff filed a \ncase in Federal court under diversity of citizenship jurisdiction, this \nFederal legislation would govern the case. If the plaintiff filed this \nsuit in State court, State law would control. However, if the defendant \nsuccessfully removed a case filed in State court to Federal court, this \nFederal law would apply.\n  My amendment would restore the federalism that the bills currently \ndrafted would threaten. At a time when the American people \noverwhelmingly believe that the Federal Government has obtained too \nmuch power at the expense of the people and the States, we should not \nadopt a Washington-knows-best approach to tort law.\n  Particularly troubling is the selective preemption H.R. 956 creates. \nStates cannot provide less protection to defendants than the bill \nmandates, but States are not prohibited from providing more. It is the \nbill's selective preemption that guarantees that it will not produce a \nuniform response to a supposedly national problem. The preemptive \nfeatures of the bill overlook that Americans are unique individuals. \nMoreover, States have their own right to determine the law that should \nbe applied to their own special situations.\n  My amendment is based not only on theories of federalism, it also \nrecognizes the enormous practical problems the bill, as currently \ndrafted, would cause to State-Federal relations.\n  Because State law would still govern tort cases to the extent that \nthe bill did not preempt it, there would be numerous questions to \nlitigate concerning the relationship between the Federal law and \nexisting State laws. New, different, and inconsistent interpretations \nof the Federal law and the State laws would result. Under the \nunderlying bill, Federal courts of appeal would resolve these issues. \nThose courts, not State courts, would ultimately determine the scope \nand meaning of State law as it interacts with this bill. To my mind, \nFederal courts should be bound by State court decisions on the meaning \nof controlling State law. By contrast, this bill would make State \ncourts follow Federal court interpretations of controlling State law. \nSuch a regime turns federalism on its head.\n  As I previously stated, my amendment recognizes that interstate \ncommerce is the justification for a Federal tort reform bill. And it is \ninterstate commerce that justifies Federal court \n[[Page S6050]] jurisdiction in cases brought by citizens of one State \nagainst citizens of another State. I believe that the commerce clause \nrationale of the bill corresponds precisely with the reasons underlying \nFederal diversity jurisdiction. Moreover, by adding this amendment, the \nbill would actually provide a uniform law in Federal court to resolve \nthe tort cases to which it applies. The existing bill would not achieve \nthat result.\n  Despite the claims made, no one truly knows the effect that this \nunderlying bill will have on the ability of injured persons to recover \nadequate compensation for their injuries. Nor will anyone know whether \ncompetitiveness of American businesses will be enhanced or insurance \npremiums will fall if H.R. 956 is enacted. At the same time, the bill \nwould displace 200 years of law based on actual experience. If the bill \nfailed to achieve its objectives, there would be almost no means of \nunscrambling the federalized egg. By contrast, applying the bill only \nto Federal court cases would provide an opportunity to experiment. If \nthe bill's ideas work, States can adopt these rules as their own. \nPotentially, a preemptive approach might then make sense. But if the \nbill created numerous practical problems, well-tested State law would \nremain undisturbed while Congress acted to fix the problems in the \nFederal law.\n  The practical effect of the amendment would be that defendants sued \nout of State in many instances would be able to remove their cases to \nFederal court and obtain the Federal rule. Defendants sued in their \nhome State courts would not be able to remove the case to Federal \ncourt. Thus, those defendants would be governed by their State law as \napplied by their own State court. I believe that this is a much more \nsensible approach than the one now before the Senate, and one \nconsistent with the Federal system and the Constitution.\n  Mr. President, we should protect the right of the States we represent \nto maintain their core function of crafting law designed to compensate \ninjured persons. We should also permit Federal courts to apply Federal \nlaw to those cases that represent truly national concerns. We should \ncertainly be careful before we displace many years of law based on \nexperience. My amendment would accomplish all those goals. I strongly \nrecommend its adoption.\n          amendment no. 618, as modified, to amendment no. 596\n\n  Mr. THOMPSON. Mr. President, I send the amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee has sent up a \nmodification. Is there objection to the modification? Without \nobjection, it is so ordered. The amendment is so modified.\n  The amendment (No. 618) as modified, is as follows:\n\n       On page 9, line 3, after ``commenced'' insert the \n     following: ``in a Federal court pursuant to section 1332 of \n     title 28, United States Code, or removed to a Federal court \n     pursuant to chapter 89 of such title''.\n       On page 10, line 19, strike ``or'' at the end.\n       On page 11, line 4, strike the period at the end and insert \n     ``; or'' and add the following new paragraph:\n       (8) create a cause of action or provide for jurisdiction by \n     a Federal Court under section 1331 or 1337 of title 28, \n     United States Code, that otherwise would not exist under \n     applicable Federal or State law.\n\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n\n\n                             Change of Vote\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Will the Senator yield for a unanimous-consent \nrequest? I have just a short unanimous-consent request to make.\n  Mr. President, on vote 139 that took place yesterday, I voted \n``yea.'' It was my intention to vote ``no.'' It does not change the \noutcome of the vote in any way. I ask unanimous consent that that be \nrecorded as a ``no.''\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, I will be very brief, I say to my friend \nfrom Washington, because I have a satellite TV feed to high school \nstudents in Illinois that is going on right now.\n  Mr. GORTON. This Senator simply wanted to inquire about a time \nagreement.\n  Mr. SIMON. I will be very brief.\n  Mr. President, I strongly support and am pleased to cosponsor this \namendment. It is right in theory. It is in line particularly with the \nCourt decision that was made the other day about guns in school. I \nhappen to disagree with that Court decision, but that is the law of the \nland. But it is right practically.\n  What we are doing without this amendment is massively overturning two \ncenturies of tort law and tort decisions. What this amendment says is, \n``Let's move a little slowly. Let's apply this in the Federal courts \nbut not in the State courts.''\n  So we can learn, and maybe we will want to, after we have had a \nlittle experience, apply it to the State courts. I think it is a sound \namendment. I am pleased to support and cosponsor the amendment of my \ncolleague from Tennessee.\n  Mr. GORTON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, first, I should like to inquire of the \nSenator from Tennessee, and those who support his amendment, whether or \nnot we might reach a time agreement for the disposition of this \namendment.\n  Mr. HEFLIN. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Not at this time.\n  Mr. HEFLIN. I do not think so at this time. I think we want to ask \nsome questions and do some things and have a clearer understanding of \nwhat the Thompson amendment does.\n I want to engage in a colloquy at least and so forth relative to the \nmatter. So I would think at this time we ought to know.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington has the floor.\n  Mr. GORTON. If that is the case, I obviously will defer asking for \nsuch a unanimous-consent but will hope that with support of the \namendment we will agree to one. The debate will ultimately be \nterminated, perhaps, or at least dealt with by a motion to table. But \nif we can plan the afternoon and evening, it will be helpful.\n  Mr. EXON. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. GORTON. Yes, I will.\n  Mr. EXON. Since there is a time deadline of 1 p.m., I would like to \nask my friend from Washington whether or not there could be general \nagreement on the passage of an amendment that he and I have worked out \nwith regard to product liability that I think has been cleared on both \nsides of the aisle. We have been trying to find an appropriate time to \ndo that. If possible, I think we can do it in 2 or 3 minutes if we can \nget unanimous-consent and if that is the will of my friend from \nWashington, the manager of the bill.\n  Mr. GORTON. Parliamentary inquiry. Is the rule that all amendments \nmust be filed or formally introduced by 1 o'clock?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Rule XXII requires that they be filed.\n  Mr. GORTON. This Senator is perfectly willing to deal with the \namendment of the Senator from Nebraska, with which he is familiar. I am \nnot sure that the other Senators here are, however. So I do not know \nthat it is cleared yet.\n  Mr. EXON. I thought it had been cleared.\n  Mr. GORTON. I suggest the Senator file it and discuss it with the \nprincipal opponents to the overall bill, and perhaps we can do it in 1 \nor 2 minutes. It looks to me that they do not know what it is about.\n  Mr. HEFLIN. Mr. President, as I understand it, he is filing it with \nthe idea of meeting the post-cloture requirement. In the event of that, \nall he has to do is file it at the desk and we can do it. Is that not \nall he has to do is file it at the desk?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment must be timely filed to be \ngermane.\n  Mr. HEFLIN. All right.\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, I will comply with the wishes of my \ncolleagues.\n  Mr. HEFLIN. In order to clarify, I think if there are amendments \npeople have, if there is no objection, I think it may be extended until \n3 o'clock or something like that, if people have them. I do not know of \nany more I am going to file myself.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington has the floor.\n  Mr. HEFLIN. Are there any objections to that?\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I do not think I am authorized to make \nthat distinction at this point. The Senator \n[[Page S6051]] can file it right now, and then, if we settle it later, \nwe can take it up and dispose of it promptly, which I hope will be the \ncase.\n  Mr. President, I find myself in a somewhat paradoxical situation. \nWith almost all of the remarks and policy positions presented by the \nSenator from Tennessee, I find myself in agreement. Yesterday, for \nexample, I voted with him against a limit on noneconomic damages in the \nmedical malpractice portions of this bill, at least in part for the \nvery kind of reasons that he outlined. I also found most forceful and \npersuasive--having used it myself--his arguments that the strongest \ncase for congressional legislation in this field rests in the field of \nproduct liability, because we deal, almost without exception, with \nproducts manufactured in one State, sold in interstate commerce in a \nnational market.\n  I lost him, however, on the last turn--that that very forceful \nargument for greater uniformity in the rules under which product \nliability litigation was conducted therefore meant that we should apply \nthis bill only to litigation conducted in Federal courts, whether it be \nproduct liability or presumably other forms of litigation which have \nnow been adopted as a part of this bill. In that, I profoundly disagree \nwith him and find it somewhat surprising that he and other good, \nthoughtful lawyers and former judges in this body would countenance \nthis amendment, even if they oppose this bill overall.\n  Now, one set of my reasons is purely pragmatic. The other is academic \nand theoretical, but nonetheless vitally important, perhaps more \nimportant than the practical reasons. The practical reasons are that 95 \npercent of product liability cases are filed in State rather than in \nFederal courts. Ninety-five percent. That is not unlike the proportion \nof all cases in State and in Federal courts. Overwhelmingly, legal \ndisputes are decided in State courts, not in Federal courts themselves.\n  So, if interstate commerce is a justification, at least for the \nproduct liability provisions of this bill, why should the rules of this \nbill be limited to litigation conducted in Federal courts? That is to \nsay, 5 percent of such litigation. The interstate commerce impacts of \nthe development, the production, the distribution, and the use of \nproducts, is not affected in the slightest by the location of the court \nin which disputes or problems in connection with those products arise. \nIf the interstate commerce clause is justification for any Federal \nrules in this field, it is justification for such rules in State courts \nto exactly the same extent that it is justification for such rules in \nFederal courts. There simply is no difference.\n  The interstate commerce is not the lawsuit, it is not the litigation, \nMr. President; the interstate commerce is the travel of the product, \nthe fact that the product is produced in one place, sold in another, \nperhaps developed in a third and used by a particular individual in a \nfourth State, or maybe in 10 or 20 States if it is a movable product. \nIf we are going to have a set of rules with respect to product \nliability litigation, obviously, they should apply in all courts.\n  Let us go beyond that. We have said that, at the present time, the \ndistribution of these cases is approximately 95 percent to 5 percent. \nWe also have opposition to this bill primarily on the grounds that it \nwill make some litigation more difficult or will limit the recovery of \npunitive damages. So the choice now of any lawyer representing a \nplaintiff in any case which does not have more severe limits on this \nlitigation than are contained in this bill will be to bring that \nlitigation in State court. In fact, if a lawyer who has a choice \nbetween the two brought it into Federal court, that lawyer would \nprobably be guilty of malpractice. What earthly reason would there be \nto bring such a case in Federal court?\n  So instead of 5 percent of all cases in Federal court, would it be 1 \npercent? Would it be less than 1 percent? For all practical purposes, \nit would approach zero. We would gain no experience in finding which \nset of rules were better by the passage of this amendment.\n  In fact, what we are learning with the present experimentation is \nsome States have more product liability litigation and some have \ngreater punitive damage awards than others do.\n  Now, of course, this amendment applies not only to litigation which \nis commenced in Federal Court but litigation which is originally \ncommenced in the State court and removed to Federal court. And, Mr. \nPresident, to oversimplify the case, getting into the Federal court \nwith a product liability case like this is almost always going to be \nbased on what is called ``diversity of citizenship.''\n That is to say, the claimants, the plaintiff; in one State, the \ndefendant is from another State, or a certain amount is in issue.\n\n  If that is the case, and the original action is brought at a State \ncourt, it can be removed by the defendant to a Federal court. This \nright, however, does not exist when the parties are from the same State \nor when there is more than one party and there is a complete and total \ndiversity of citizenship.\n  Again, Mr. President, given the way in which claimant lawyers operate \nin these situations, always suing or almost always suing not just the \nmanufacturer but the retailer, sometimes the wholesaler, the developer, \nand the like, again, almost any competent lawyer can prevent the \nexistence of diversity jurisdiction.\n  Mr. President, I would predict, I think there is not much opportunity \nto be contradicted, we would not have 1 percent of this kind of \nlitigation actually conducted in Federal courts if this amendment were \npassed. We would not get this experimentation. We would simply see to \nit that the relatively small handful of such lawsuits now conducted in \nFederal courts ended up being conducted in State courts.\n  Even more troubling to me, at least, Mr. President, is the \nproposition that this so profoundly changes the nature of diversity \nlitigation in Federal courts, and gives such a reward to those who game \nthe system to find the best place in which to sue, that it has been \nexactly the opposite role that has obtained for a minimum of 60 years \nin this country.\n  Everyone in this body now who went to law school, or were at one time \nin law school, is familiar with the case in the Supreme Court of the \nUnited States called Erie Railroad Co. versus Tompkins in the year \n1938.\n  The Supreme Court, as long ago as that year, found lawyers gaming the \nsystem, figuring out if a more favorable rule of law were going to be \napplied in the Federal court than the State court, they would try to \nget in to the Federal courts.\n  So the Supreme Court quite wisely said ``Look, you bring one of these \nproduct liability lawsuits in Federal court or remove it to Federal \ncourt, we are going to apply exactly the same legal rules that State \ncourts in that State would apply.''\n  So we cannot get a better deal, a more favorable law, a more \nfavorable rule by going into Federal court. A person would get exactly \nthe same rules. That, of course, has been the law of the country ever \nsince. It is that Supreme Court case that this amendment would \noverturn.\n  I do not mean to say it would be unconstitutional; certainly it would \nbe constitutional. That is simply a ruling by the Supreme Court on \nthese relationships. But if Congress wants to create an entirely \ndifferent rule, it can do so.\n  In fact, this Congress has always in the past followed the rule of \nErie versus Tompkins. When Congress does create Federal rules of tort \nlaw--and it does in the Federal Employees Liability Act and the Federal \nLongshore and Harbor Workers Compensation Act, and the Merchant Marine \nAct--it always says that those rules are going to be applied in any \ncourt wherever it is located in which such an action is brought, so \nthat the system cannot be gamed.\n  It would be utterly improper, Mr. President, to depart from that wise \nset of rules and to move to a system in which consciously we set up one \nset of rules for actions in Federal court and another completely \ndifferent set of rules for actions in State courts.\n  Nor does anything in the bill criticized by the Senator from \nTennessee on the relationship between State and Federal courts, \nundercut or contradict that. If I understood him correctly, the Senator \nfrom Tennessee, said that this bill would have Federal courts \ninterpreting State law through the circuit courts of appeal. Not so.\n  [[Page S6052]] I will read the section that has to do with that \nrelationship from the current bill. It says, ``Notwithstanding any \nother provision of law, any decision of a circuit court of appeals \ninterpreting a provision of this title,'' that is to say, Federal law \nif we pass this ``this title shall be considered a controlling \nprecedent with respect to any subsequent decision made concerning the \ninterpretation of such provision by any Federal or State court within \nthe geographical boundaries of the area under the jurisdiction of the \nCircuit Court of Appeals.''\n  This does not change the law. This is the law right now--Federal \ncourts have priority in the interpretation of Federal law. At least at \nthe Supreme Court level, that determination is binding on State courts \nwhen State courts interpret Federal law.\n  Nothing in this section gives Federal courts of appeal the right to \ninterpret State laws. It only gives them the right to interpret this \nlaw, assuming that we pass it, which is something in my view that we \ndid not have this section in the bill itself.\n  But to return to the argument, the argument is presented very \nforcibly by those who do not want the Congress legislating in this \nentire field, who are content with 50 to 53 different jurisdictions on \ntort law. They have a lot of precedent on their side. This has been, by \nand large with the exception of certain Federal statutes, the way in \nwhich these relationships have been conducted in the past.\n  The impact of changes in the legal system, more litigious system, \nhigher judgments, greater risks to research and development of \nproducts, has created an urgency, I think a sufficient urgency, to move \ncautiously into this field. It can certainly be properly argued as it \nis on the other side that, no, we should not interfere at all.\n  I think it is that argument that ought to be made, Mr. President, \nthat we should not involve ourselves in these issues, that we should \ndefeat this bill. I do not think we should do it by presenting an \namendment, first, which will not have any effect because there will be \nso few cases brought; and, second, reverses a wise decision of the \nSupreme Court of almost 60 years in age designed to prevent forum \nshopping, by saying whatever court a person is in they will abide by \nthe same rule which this bill is consistent and which this amendment is \nnot.\n  I hope we can get on to debating the merits of the entire bill, \nproduct liability, medical malpractice, rules relating to punitive \ndamages and the like.\n  As I say, the Senator from Tennessee illustrated the fact that we \nhave a problem, that we have a problem that crosses State lines. I \nbelieve we should do something about that problem, but I would rather \nsee Members do nothing than to totally change the relationship between \nthe State and the Federal courts in the manner which would be \naccomplished by this amendment.\n  Mr. COCHRAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, let me, first of all, compliment the \ndistinguished Senator from Tennessee for bringing this issue to the \nSenate in the form of this amendment. I think it highlights the \nfrustration that many Members feel at this point in the consideration \nof this legislation.\n  The Senator from Washington very correctly points out that this may \nbe an amendment on which reasonable scholars, even, could disagree in \nterms of its impact on this bill before the Senate.\n  I think it speaks to a frustration that we have seen so many \namendments adopted now, and have been rejected, that seek to enlarge \nconsiderably the subject matter which was first presented to this \nSenate in this product liability bill.\n  I think it is clear that there is a sound jurisdictional basis for \nthe Congress to legislate in this area under the commerce clause--at \nleast that is my opinion--but it does not necessarily extend to all of \nthe subjects that have been debated on this floor after the bill has \nbeen called up.\n  We have now undertaken to fully explore the Federal role in limiting \nor modifying or writing new rules for professional liability of \nphysicians and others in the health care area, why not insist that \nthere be included a title on architects and engineers who are also \nprofessionals and who are held to a higher standard of conduct because \nthey are professionals, but they are not included.\n  Are we going to permit, then, the legislation to proceed and have all \nother professionals excluded because of this omission? Even lawyers are \nprofessionals in the view of most. I mean, they are held to the same \nhigh standard of conduct as professionals. So when they breach their \nduty to provide skilled and thoughtful and professional assistance for \npay to some member of society, they are held liable if they breach that \nduty, under the standards that are written into the law, just as \nphysicians are, or hospitals, or others. So I think what the Senator \nfrom Tennessee is pointing out is that we are out into the deep water \nnow in an effort to comprehensively reform the civil justice system of \nthe United States, piecemeal, on the floor of the Senate.\n  We have committees that have jurisdiction over some of these areas. \nThe Labor Committee, for example, had a markup session and reported out \na bill dealing with malpractice liability and reforms in that area. As \nI understand it, that was the basis of the amendment of the Senator \nfrom Kentucky, Senator McConnell, on medical malpractice, which the \nSenate has now adopted.\n  I understand the Banking Committee also is considering reporting out \nlegal reform legislation dealing with securities transactions where \nclass action suits are brought against companies or brokerage houses \nfor various alleged acts of negligence or breaches of duty to the \ngeneral public with respect to the value of securities or the conduct \nof officers and board members with respect to running the companies in \na skilled way, or at least up to that standard that is owed to the \ninvestor who might buy stock in that company.\n  There has developed, as I understand it, a sort of cottage industry \nin some legal circles of bringing these kinds of actions, and now there \nis a cry for reform and restraint and restrictions on those kinds of \nactions. The Banking Committee has taken that up. They are considering \nit, and I understand they are going to report out a bill. If we are \ngoing to reform comprehensively the civil justice system of this \ncountry, why not await the advice of the Banking Committee on that \nsubject and include that as a title in this bill or some bill?\n  I understand the Judiciary Committee has now before it a proposal by \nthe chairman of that committee, Senator Hatch from Utah, which includes \nsuggestions for other reforms in the civil justice system of the \ncountry.\n  My concern, which is reflected in this amendment of the Senator from \nTennessee, is that we have gone so far now, we need to stop and say: \n``Wait a minute. This is not a civil justice reform bill. It is not \nall-inclusive,'' and try to narrow the application and the scope of \nthis legislation to something that more narrowly fits the purpose of \nthe bill that was brought to the floor by the Commerce Committee.\n  This bill relates to products liability. While some of us disagree \nabout some of the provisions--we might want to change it, amendments \nought to be considered--nonetheless, it had a fairly narrow application \nthat was firmly based upon the commerce clause of the Constitution \ngiving the Congress the power to legislate in this area. Some of these \narguments that I have heard have absolutely nothing whatsoever to do \nwith the Federal role in our society.\n  When they were talking about setting the lawyers' fees in certain \ncontingent cases, I thought back to the time when I remember organized \nprofessional groups pleading with the Congress to do something about \nthe Federal Trade Commission because they were about to get into the \nfee schedules of local professional organizations. Do you remember \nthat? Several years ago there was a great hue and cry by the--well, I \nam not going to name the groups. They might get more attention than \nthey want.\n  But the point is, we were arguing that the Federal Trade Commission \ndid not have anything to do with the setting of fees at the local level \nby professionals. That was something that was regulated by professional \nsocieties, or State laws, or other entities--not the Federal \nGovernment. And now here we are being asked to pass judgment on a \n[[Page S6053]] fee charged by a lawyer to his client in a purely local \naction maybe. It does not have anything to do with the Federal \nGovernment. And the Federal Government should not have anything to do \nwith that. If you want to read and give effect to the Constitution, \nthat separates the Federal role from State governments' roles in these \nareas.\n  So I am troubled about where we are now. I think at some point we may \nhave an opportunity to consider whether this bill should be modified in \na way that puts it more nearly back to where it started and that is \ndealing with product liability rather than an effort to comprehensively \nfix or modify every conceivable area of civil justice procedure or \nsubstantive law that strikes a Senator in a moment of serious concern \nthat needs to be addressed on this bill, and we have seen those \namendments come up now, and I guess we will see many others.\n  So I again compliment the Senator from Tennessee for trying to put in \nperspective what we are doing here and what we ought not to be doing \nhere.\n  I intend to vote for his amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. DeWine). The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, we had the occasion to attend the \nfuneral of our distinguished former colleague, Senator Stennis. Time \nand again the visiting Senators who had served with him talked about \nhis wisdom. My only comment is the wisdom of that distinguished \ngentleman is not lost to the Senate when you hear the Senator from \nMississippi, Senator Cochran, talk. He does talk with professionalism. \nHe does talk of trying to act professionally with respect to a Federal \nlegislative body, and his statement on the amendment of the \ndistinguished Senator from Tennessee is music to my ears.\n  This has been sort of a run-amok situation. When the Senator from \nMississippi says it is not the intent to reform the whole civil justice \nsystem, we started on product liability--that is what he thought and \nthat is what I thought but that is not what the contract calls for. I \ndo not want somebody to say I had gotten partisan on this thing, \nbecause I am welcoming the bipartisanship with respect to the amendment \nof the Senator from Tennessee. But the RNC talking points show they do \nnot have any idea of product liability. But they do have the civil \njustice. The contract calls for that. And you have seen what has been \nprovided, Senator, on the House side, which is very, very disturbing.\n  Right to the amendment of the Senator from Tennessee, and \nparticularly his address, which has really been music to my ears. It is \nlike a drink of water in the desert, because he talks professionally of \nthe duty and responsibility here of the U.S. Congress and the Federal \nGovernment. We do not find--and I agree with the Senator from \nTennessee--the need for the Federal Government to start preempting \nlocal jury trials and the handling of tort cases at the local level. So \nwhat he is saying is, to try to keep step with the theme upon which he \nwas elected--and incidentally it has been the theme upon which I have \nbeen elected for 28 to 29 years--is that the government that is the \nbest government--the Jeffersonian phrase most often quoted--``is that \nclosest to the people'' and the local folks decide these things.\n  As I have said time and again here, you have a solution looking for a \nproblem, because product liability cases are on a diminishing scale. \nThere is no Federal problem with respect to the lawyers' fees \nnationally with respect to their clients.\n  It is only to deter and enhance and enrich the manufacturer that we \neven had the Abraham-McConnell amendment. But what the Senator from \nTennessee does, as I read this amendment, is sort of bring a little \norder out of chaos. With respect to applicability, and in diversity \ncases under title 18 what we have is a jurisdiction and a \nresponsibility.\n  So this would apply to the provisions of this bill, and diversity \nonly in those cases that have been removed from the State courts to the \nFederal system. Yes. We have in Federal court a responsibility at the \nFederal level. And let us apply whatever they desire, which is almost \nopen sesame now around here. I cannot tell what the next thing is \ncoming up. But like the sheepdog can taste the blood, they are going to \ngobble up all the rights of the individuals back home because all of a \nsudden we, who have been elected by the people back home--think the \npeople back home have totally lost judgment. We have to tell them how, \nwhy, where, and when. You can put in this evidence but you cannot put \nin this.\n  If that is necessary, the Senator from Tennessee says, let it apply \nin those diversity and removal cases, and then we will have fulfilled \nour responsibility. I hate to talk longer on the amendment because you \nbecome identified with your position in these matters. Somebody would \nsay--I can hear them now--``Well, Hollings is for the Senator from \nTennessee's amendment, you had better vote against it.''\n  I am trying to laud the distinguished Senator from Tennessee, \nparticularly his comments. I just listened as he went chapter and verse \nright down the line. That is the first address of which I had the \noccasion to hear the distinguished Senator from Tennessee. I listened \nto him through his client, Senator Howard Baker, years ago in earlier \nproceedings. But now he is speaking in and of himself. I find that \nsolid. When they talk about common sense, that solid common sense is \ncoming through with respect to this particular issue of product \nliability and the amendment of the Senator from Tennessee. So I \nheartily endorse the attention, particularly of my colleague from West \nVirginia, one of the leading sponsors on this bill.\n  When it comes down to law, yes. We have a responsibility on the \nFederal side--diversity and removal. And let us apply whatever \neverybody decides by a majority vote is necessary to occur. But let us \nnot in the context of simplicity and uniformity come back in and jumble \nthis whole thing into the 50 jurisdictions with the 50 different \ninterpretations and bring it up to the Federal system for even further \ninterpretations and appeals and say that what we have now is \nuniformity.\n  The Senator from Tennessee gives us uniformity. There is no question \nabout it in this particular amendment. I heartily endorse his \ninitiative and his amendment.\n  I hope we can sort of calm down now without all of the little \namendments of interested parties. They are on a roll--you can see by \nthe way the votes are going--to affect all civil cases with respect to \npunitive damages. You would never think that would occur on the floor \nof the U.S. Senate because punitive damages had a salutary effect in \nour society. All I have heard is about runaway juries and the legal \nsystem as a lottery; these catcalls you might call it. It is almost \nlike an athletic event up here. The deliberative body is the \ncheerleading section. The Senator from Tennessee says let us get out of \nthe stands, get out of the chair, and get down on the field of \nresponsibility and act like Senators and legislate where we have that \nresponsibility, and leave the States and the local folks to their own \njudgments, their own considerations.\n  It is not a national problem. There have been problems arising. \nStates have treated it differently. They have all revised practically \nall of their product liability laws in the last 15 years. These State \nlegislatures come up and say, ``For Heaven's sake, leave us alone.'' \nThey testified before the Commerce Committee. The Association of State \nSupreme Court Justices, a bipartisan group says,\n\n       For Heaven's sake, let us not put this thing in where we \n     have to take all of these words of art and interpretation in \n     the 50 States. Leave us alone.\n\n  The American Bar Association, a bipartisan group if there ever was \none, and a study group of lawyers said we studied it again. It is \ntotally off base. We oppose this bill. Mr. President, 123 legal \nscholars have come forward and said now you really, in an effort to \ngive what you call common sense or uniformity or fairness--to get the \nbuzzwords going--what you have really done is given the highest degree \nof unfairness, the highest degree of complexity that you could possibly \nimagine. They testified. The attorneys general testified against this \nmeasure. There it is.\n  How do I get that over to my colleagues? Well, thank heavens. I know \na lot of them would listen to the leadership of the Senator from \nTennessee, \n[[Page S6054]] and I hope they will on this particular score.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. HEFLIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. HEFLIN. Mr. President, I certainly join Senator Hollings with \nregard to the remarks that have been made by the distinguished Senator \nfrom Tennessee and the distinguished Senator from Mississippi.\n  The Senator from Mississippi talked about the fact that here we are \nreally going with this, a product liability to, in effect, change all \ncivil actions; changing the tort laws. All of a sudden, we have adopted \nthe Dole amendment which extends to all civil actions affecting \ncommerce. Of course, under the laws pertaining to commerce, it does not \nsay ``interstate commerce.'' It says ``commerce.'' I mean some people \nresent the decision pertaining to the Lopez case that was handed down. \nBut this does not say ``interstate commerce.'' It says affecting \n``commerce''--the language in the Dole amendment.\n  I wonder, how far does this go? Of all civil actions? Civil actions, \nif there are civil rights cases, based on State law? Is it covered by \nthis? Does this apply to that? If there are civil rights cases under \nFederal law, are they affected by this? There are so many questions \nthat are raised. There have been, for example, longstanding railroad \nlaws pertaining to FELA cases. Are they affected by that? There are \nlongstanding admiralty laws which are civil cases; are they affected by \nthese amendments? Is the Jones Act, which is another matter pertaining \nto seafarers, affected by this act? There are so many things that just \nimmediately come to mind that raise concerns in my mind.\n  Consider, for example, the antitrust laws that are enacted by States. \nYou have the standard of three times damages, and as the bill is now \namended, it is reduced down to two times.\n  Economic? If there are no noneconomic damages, then it is reduced \ndown to twice. Are we changing the antitrust laws in reducing the \npenalties pertaining to those?\n  Senator Cochran mentioned that here we are attempting to change all \nof these laws on the floor of the Senate.\n  I said there have been groups that have studied the tort law. There \nis the American Law Institute that has published the restatement of \ntorts. They have published the restatement of a great number of various \nfields of law. This product liability bill, the underlying bill, has no \nresemblance to that study group which has over the years included \ndefense counsel, plaintiff's counsel, professors, scholars, and people \nwho have worked on the concept of tort law, including product liability \nlaw. But this has been written by lawyers that are interested in trying \nto save themselves money, and they are trying to save themselves money \nat the expense of injured people. And now it is being extended to all \ncivil actions.\n  Now, I am not exactly sure what the Thompson amendment does, and I \nwould like to sort of engage in a colloquy and ask the Senator some \nquestions pertaining to it.\n  From what I have been able to read and in listening to my colleague \nspeak, really the Senator's amendment, as I understand it, limits the \napplication of the underlying bill as now amended to Federal courts \nonly. Is that correct?\n  Mr. THOMPSON. That is correct, I say to the Senator.\n  Mr. HEFLIN. In other words, it is not controlling on actions that are \ntried in State courts, such as the Senator's State and such as Senator \nCochran's State.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. That is correct.\n  Mr. HEFLIN. It does not impose any of those provisions that are in \nthe underlying bill, as amended, upon the State of Tennessee, the State \nof Mississippi, the State of Alabama, the State of New York, or any \nother State--it does not impose those provisions on them; is that \ncorrect?\n  Mr. THOMPSON. That is absolutely correct.\n  Mr. HEFLIN. All right. Now, the provision dealing with the \ninterpretation of the court of appeals, which is in the underlying \nbill, the court of appeals that might interpret a district court and \nthe Federal courts, that decision that is made relative to the \nunderlying bill, as amended, would not affect proceedings in a State \ncourt?\n  Mr. THOMPSON. Under my amendment, that is correct.\n  Mr. HEFLIN. As I understand it, the Senator's amendment does not \ncreate a new cause of action or a Federal cause of action. Is that \ncorrect?\n  Mr. THOMPSON. That is exactly correct.\n  Mr. HEFLIN. In other words, the Senator's amendment, in effect, says \nthat the provisions of the underlying bill--you have provisions dealing \nwith punitive damages; you have provisions dealing with misuse and \nalteration; you have standards that are created relative to punitive \ndamages; you have provisions dealing with intoxication and defenses on \nthat----\n  Mr. THOMPSON. In the medical area also.\n  Mr. HEFLIN. You have the biomaterials provision and all of that in \nthe product liability bill. Are those provisions limited strictly to \ncases that are tried in Federal district courts?\n  Mr. THOMPSON. That is correct.\n  Mr. HEFLIN. All right. So, now, if I understand it from the Senator's \nspeech and also Senator Simon's speech, the Senator's idea is that this \nwould be an experiment, in effect a pilot program for a period of time \nin which you would determine how it would work, and from it, State \ncourts could use the experience. State could learn from that \nexperience? And, of course, Congress could look at the same thing and \nlearn from the experiences that might be contained therein; is that \ncorrect?\n  Mr. THOMPSON. Yes, that is correct.\n  It occurs to me on that point that States have learned, for example, \nfrom the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure and I believe also perhaps \nthe Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure. Federal courts adopted rules \nthat proved to be effective, and after a period of time States like \nTennessee and others adopted State rules that resemble very much or in \nsome cases are identical to the Federal rules, because over a period of \ntime they proved to be salutary and desirable.\n  Mr. HEFLIN. All right. The distinguished Senator from Tennessee, I am \nsure, knows of the doctrine which came out of a case in the Supreme \nCourt called Erie versus Tompkins. Now, Erie versus Tompkins basically \nsays that State law prevails in diversity cases and prevails in Federal \ncases in the event that the Federal law is not written to approach it. \nIn other words, if there is a void in Federal law, then the concept is \nthat State law will be followed under the doctrine of Erie versus \nTompkins in the Federal courts.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. Yes. The Federal court can follow the substantive law \nof the State.\n  Mr. HEFLIN. The Senator is correct in regard to substantive law. So \nif this particular bill, as amended, is silent relative to a State law \nand is not preempted, then a Federal court would continue to apply \nState substantive law in a case brought in the Federal courts? Is that \ncorrect?\n  Mr. THOMPSON. That is absolutely correct. In other words, in other \ndiversity cases not covered by the provisions of this amendment or the \nunderlying bill, Erie would apply and the substantive law of the States \nas always would still apply in those cases.\n  Mr. HEFLIN. Basically, I have a reservation on the philosophical \nviewpoint. I think, No. 1, as the bill presently stands, as it is \namended, the Senator's amendment is an improvement. I do have \nreservations as to whether or not from a philosophical viewpoint we \nought to be legislating in an area that has been left to the States for \nmany years. And so it is a question of federalism. I am in somewhat of \na conflict as to whether or not I would support the Senator's \namendment, and that is something I am going to think about and give a \nlittle more thought to.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. If I could respond to that point just a moment, I think \nthe Senator is reflecting a conflict that is going on within a lot of \nus. A lot of us understand the concern of our constituencies that \nbusinesses, and so forth, have legitimate complaints. A lot of us are \nalso concerned about this rush to judgment, where the U.S. Congress and \nthe Federal Government are on the verge of supplanting 200 years of \nState law, at a time when many of us are saying in other areas, whether \nit be welfare reform, regulatory reform, \n[[Page S6055]] taxes, or unfunded mandates, we are all saying get the \nGovernment out of the States' business. States are where the innovation \nis going on. Let them take care of themselves. So we are all engaged in \nthat conflict.\n  Product liability has been discussed in the Chamber of this body for \nmany years, long before I arrived. The Senator, I am sure, has engaged \nin those debates over the years. I think there is a feeling that this \nis an area wherein there is more justification for our involvement on \nthe Federal level because of the inherent interstate nature of the \nactivities. Seventy percent of all manufactured goods now travel in \ninterstate commerce.\n  If I had my desire, if I could write the legislation, or I could come \nto the conclusion, perhaps this is not where I would be. But I see the \nfreight train going down the tracks, and I think we at some point have \na responsibility to at least try to make sure that we wind up in as \ngood a position as we can. And for me, that is carving out an area and \nsaying, look, if we are going to do this, let us not go all across the \nboard. Let us not usurp all State laws across the board dealing in \nthese areas without knowing what we are doing.\n  The Senator from Alabama mentioned and in 5 minutes raised a dozen \nquestions that nobody knows the answers to. The answers will be decided \nthrough reams and reams and reams of court decisions throughout this \nNation over the next several years. We will create more lawyer work \nthan we ever dreamed of because of what is going on here.\n  So what I am saying is, let us take the basic part of the original \nunderlying legislation, which has to do with products liability, which \nhas more of an interstate nature to it than what goes on in some small \nlaw office, what goes on in some accountant's office, what goes on in \nsome doctor's small office or any of these other areas, and couple that \nwith the interstate nature of most of products litigation, and that is \ndiversity cases.\n  Incidentally, I disagree with my distinguished colleague from \nWashington concerning the number of diversity cases filed in Federal \ncourts. Last year, the Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts \nreported that 22,000 products cases were filed--tried or disposed of--\nin Federal courts. That represents approximately 45 percent of all \nproducts cases.\n  So, close to half of all products cases, under my amendment, would \nget the benefit of this new Federal rule and legislation that we are \nproposing. But at least we would not be, in one fell swoop, supplanting \nall of the State law that has been developed over 200 years.\n  I believe that it is justified and it makes some sense in this area \nand would allow us to take a deep breath and look and see what we have \nwrought, whether or not it is working, whether or not insurance rates \nare being affected, whether or not this is something that States want \nto emulate or something that we, as the U.S. Congress, want to \nbacktrack on and say we made a mistake. Under this, we could unscramble \nthe Federal egg a whole lot better than if we changed all the laws in \nthe States, got years of decisions, new decisions based on those laws, \nlearned that we were wrong, got a new group in the majority in this \nbody and in the House and had them come in and impose their will and \ntheir concept of justice and respond to their clients and their \nconstituents.\n  I think it would be a mess. I think we are asking for a real mess \ndown the road. What I am trying to avoid with this amendment is that \nkind of result, which I think would wreak havoc with our court system \nin this country.\n  (Mr. HATCH assumed the chair.)\n  Mr. HEFLIN. Mr. President, the Senator keeps using the word \n``interstate.'' As I read the language that we have now adopted, it is \napplied in regard to punitive damages in any civil action whose subject \nmatter affects commerce, not interstate commerce, but commerce. \nActually, it seems to me that commerce is affected almost by every \nconceivable type of action if there is a transaction. That, to me, \nunder this language that is now in here, makes it so broad. It affects \ncommerce and affects that aspect of it.\n  Now, under the Senator's amendment, he would allow for actions that \nare transferred, removed from the State courts to the Federal courts. \nAnd that is what is known as a removal action.\n  It is my understanding today that I think we passed in the Senate \nsome bills that would enlarge the jurisdiction. But the present \njurisdiction is that if the suit is for $50,000 or less, you cannot \nremove it from the State court to the Federal court. So, therefore, \nthose types of cases of a frivolous nature seeking small damages \nrelative to this matter would stay in the State court if they are \n$50,000 or less. Does the Senator interpret it that way?\n  Mr. THOMAS. Yes, I do.\n  Mr. HEFLIN. Now, if you are seeking punitive damages, you are limited \nin the amount that you claim with regard to the removal. So, chances \nare, you are not going to have many punitive damage cases that are \naffected, since there is a limit in the amount of money that you sue \nfor, in the removal of those small type cases. Does the Senator agree \nwith that?\n  Mr. THOMPSON. I am sorry, I missed that.\n  Mr. HEFLIN. I was just saying that, looking at punitive damages, we \nlook upon that as being in big figures. But if the suit is only for \n$50,000, then the amount that you sue for includes if you seek punitive \ndamages and it puts a cap on it. You cannot recover more than you can \nsue for and if you do not sue for more than $50,000, then you stay in \nthe State courts and it is not removable to the Federal court.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. I think that is correct.\n  Mr. HEFLIN. All right.\n  Now, I am not sure that I understand this provision, the last one, \nwhich is No. 8. It reads:\n\n       In section 102(c), add the following new paragraph:\n       (8) create a cause of action or provide for jurisdiction by \n     a Federal Court under section 1331 or 1337 of title 28, \n     United States Code, that otherwise would not exist under \n     applicable Federal or State law.\n\n  Now, that provision in there, I believe, is in the bill that was \nintroduced. That is to prevent saying: ``Create a Federal cause of \naction,'' and therefore leaves it strictly to the preemption that is in \nthis bill as amended and does not create a separate cause of action at \nthe Federal courts; is that correct?\n  Mr. THOMPSON. That is correct.\n  Mr. HEFLIN. I thank the Senator. I appreciate the distinguished \nSenator from Tennessee responding to my questions relative to these \nmatters. I have a better understanding relative to what his amendment \nattempts to do.\n  I might just ask him, too, in this regard, I believe if we look at \nthe Federal law and the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure that apply, \nthe distinction between equity and civil cases is now combined into \ncivil cases.\n  So in the Federal law that we have today under the Federal Rules of \nCivil Procedure, cases that we used to make a distinction between--we \nused to have really three types of cases. You would have criminal \ncases, you would have civil cases, and equity cases.\n  But the Federal Rules of Procedure, of course, which are not affected \nby Erie versus Tompkins, are now combined and you have equity and civil \ncases in it. So, basically, under the present Dole amendment, basically \nwhat we are looking at are really two types of cases--criminal cases \nand civil cases.\n  Under this, in regard to the Dole amendment as to punitive damages, \nin other words, the only thing it really excludes is criminal cases. \nWould the Senator agree with that?\n  Mr. THOMPSON. That seems to be the result of it.\n  Mr. HEFLIN. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. THOMPSON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. Mr. President, I, too, share the concern of the Senator \nfrom Alabama concerning the application of the commerce clause to some \nof the amendments that we have already adopted. I suppose the courts \nwill have to determine whether or not there is sufficient interstate \ncommerce with regard to some of these matters in the future.\n  In response to some of the comments made by the Senator from \nWashington, I have already pointed out that according to the American \nBar Foundation, which is an independent body, separate from the \nAmerican Bar Association, \n[[Page S6056]] that if you include all the product liability cases \nfiled in Federal court, plus those removed to Federal court--in other \nwords, the subject of this amendment--you have approximately 45 percent \nof the product liability cases that were filed last year. So this is \nnot a situation where only a handful of cases would be brought in \nFederal court.\n  Second, the amendment which I propose is not, as it has been \ncharacterized, a killer amendment designed to oppose any kind of \nreform. We started off early on in this body dealing with frivolous \nlawsuits. The only provision in any of this debate that actually deals \nwith frivolous lawsuits is the one Senator Brown proposed concerning \nrule 11. I supported that. We need a stronger rule 11 to take care of \nfrivolous lawsuits.\n  Beyond that, it would be easy enough to simply oppose any legislation \nbecause it interferes with States' legitimate rights in these areas. We \nare not doing that. We are trying to strengthen this and come up with \nsomething that not only will pass but will not cause us to regret our \nactions later. Our amendment will give us an opportunity to see whether \nor not these broad-range measures work in the Federal court system, \nwhich is the system that we ought to be concerned with and with which \nwe can legitimately deal.\n  The question arises: Why would anybody ever file a lawsuit in Federal \ncourt anymore under the Thompson amendment? There are several reasons. \nFor example, the underlying bill, I believe, has a 20-year statute of \nrepose. Tennessee has a 10-year statute of repose. If it is past 10 \nyears since the product was manufactured, you would certainly bring the \ncase in Federal court, not State court, because you would want to get \nthe benefit of that statute of repose.\n  Also, the State of Washington and other States have no punitive \ndamages at all. A plaintiff would certainly not want to bring a case in \nState courts in Washington if he had an opportunity to do otherwise.\n  On the preemption of State law, perhaps we are just passing in the \nnight, as far as our conversation is concerned, but the underlying bill \ncertainly preempts State law with regard to the subject matter covered \nby the underlying bill. So you have a Federal circuit determining what \nthe interpretation of that law is and then the States have to follow \nthat Federal court interpretation of that Federal law in cases that are \ndecided before them.\n  On the question of forum shopping, under the underlying bill, you \ncould have 50 different sets of rules in 50 different States. For \nexample, with regard to caps, they are only caps. States are free to do \nmore restrictive things if they are within those caps. They cannot do \nmore liberal things, as far as plaintiffs are concerned. They can do \nmore restrictive things.\n  You can have 50 different sets of rules. You can have plaintiffs \nshopping through 50 different States in some situations under the \nunderlying bill. At least under this amendment, there will be many \ncases that are properly removable to Federal court. When those cases \nare removed, we will have one Federal standard.\n  So, Mr. President, I respect my distinguished colleague from \nWashington and what he is trying to do in his strong fight for a \nproducts bill. I suggest to him that what we are doing here, in the \nlong run will strengthen his efforts instead of diminish them. I \ncertainly hope this amendment gets full consideration in this body. \nThank you. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. HATCH addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Burns). The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I am proud the Senator from Tennessee is on \nthe Judiciary Committee working with us on many issues. With regard to \nthis amendment, I am very concerned about it because I believe this \namendment would undermine much of what our tort reform efforts on the \nfloor of the Senate really are about and undermine what we have been \ntrying to do this week.\n  Senator Thompson's amendment, as I view it, would strictly limit the \ncoverage of tort reform legislation and, in my opinion, would take the \nwhole substance out of this legislation.\n  Only 4 to 5 percent of tort cases are filed in our Federal courts. \nThat is still a significant number, but it is still only 4 to 5 \npercent. That is according to the Department of Justice figures. Thus, \nunder the Thompson amendment, the vast majority of litigation abuses in \nthis country would go unchecked if his amendment is adopted. Plaintiffs \nwould be able to sue in State courts to avoid having their suits \nsubject to the Federal law. Although in some cases defendants might be \nable to remove State-filed cases to Federal courts, plaintiffs' lawyers \nwill surely plead their cases in ways to prevent removal to Federal \ncourts. The end result is that defendants may be subjected to vastly \ndifferent substantive legal standards, depending on the whims or \ndesigns of plaintiffs, and that simply is not fair.\n  Under the Thompson amendment, parties would be uncertain about what \nlaws would apply to their conduct. If sued in State court, one rule \nwould apply. If sued in Federal court, an entirely different set of \nlaws could apply. That uncertainty will not address the harmful effects \non our economy today and the harmful effects that this bill is trying \nto cure. For example, higher liability insurance rates have been a \nproblem in this country for years due to abusive litigation. Under the \nThompson amendment, insurance companies will not be able to \nsignificantly reduce liability insurance rates because they will have \nno idea what risks they are going to face. They will have no idea where \nbusinesses and other groups they insure will be sued. The rates will \ncontinue to remain high, and all of those higher rates will continue to \nbe passed on to you and me as consumers.\n  So the people who really lose, if we do not pass this tort reform \nlegislation, this product liability legislation, as amended in its \ncurrent form, will be every consumer in this country. Consumer losses \namount to trillions of dollars over time, and I think it is time for us \nto face up to these problems.\n  Look, I have been a trial lawyer. I have tried hundreds of cases in \nmy legal career, many of which are cases involving torts. I have to \ntell you that I think much good is done by trial lawyers who try to \nstand up against some of the evils in society by bringing litigation \nwith regard to torts that are committed. However, we really in this \ncountry have gone way over to one side to the point where the deck is \nstacked. This bill is an attempt to try to bring our laws back to the \nmiddle where people are treated fairly, where lawyers can still win \ntheir cases, where lawyers can still win substantial verdicts, but \nwhere lawyers no longer get these runaway verdicts. These runaway \nverdicts really are happening in this country with greater frequency.\n  I might add, this kind of legislation, as evidenced by the Thompson \namendment, is highly unusual. It is one thing to apply different \nprocedural rules to cases brought in Federal or State courts. It is \nentirely another question to apply a different substantive rule. Ever \nsince the landmark decision in Erie versus Tompkins, it has been clear \nthat Federal courts sitting in diversity cases apply the substantive \nrules of State law.\n  This amendment would present a striking, perhaps even unprecedented, \napplication of a Federal law. The very same tort case would proceed in \nState court under one substantive law, but if removed to Federal court \nin the same State, because of diversity, a different substantive law \nwould apply to it. In my view, this does not make sense.\n  Senator Thompson acknowledges that the commerce clause clearly \nempowers Congress to act over product liability cases. This is not an \narea in which Congress ought to stay its hand, because the high cost of \nlitigation abuses cross State lines and because they are a serious \nproblem. I personally believe this is an area in which a limited \nFederal solution is amply justified.\n  Now, I have had judges all over this country come to me and say, \n``You must do something about punitive damages''--from the highest \ncourts of this land--because they try not to be activist judges and do \nnot believe that they can resolve this problem, and it is going to take \ncongressional enactment to do so.\n  In the last amendment, the Dole-Exon-Hatch amendment, we made a great \neffort--and it did pass--to try to \n[[Page S6057]] resolve some of these punitive damage problems. I think \nthat amendment will help us to get those problems resolved. If we \nbifurcate the system saying that amendment only applies to the Federal \ncourts and not to the State courts, we will continue this runaway \nsystem of punitive damages that is hurting everybody in America. And in \nthe process, we will be hurting the Federal courts as well and the \nright of people to go to Federal court.\n  As a trial lawyer, I went to both State and Federal courts on a \nregular basis. I have to say that I enjoyed both of them, and I found \ncompetent people in both courts. But there were areas of the law where \nthe Federal courts were better. There were areas of the law where the \nState courts were better. I tried, in the interest of my clients, to do \nthe best I could by bringing the cases, when I could, in either of the \ncourts and made the choice.\n  As a trial lawyer in those days--true, I am arguing for a time past, \n19 years ago as a trial lawyer--our major claims were for economic and \nnoneconomic damages, compensatory or noneconomic damages. We were able \nto get substantial verdicts by presenting our cases on those two \ntheories. You very seldom alleged punitive damages unless there was \negregious or intentional or willful conduct that justified punitive \ndamages. But in this day and age, it is almost malpractice to not plead \npunitive damages, even in simple negligence cases in some of these \nStates where the laws have gone awry and where the courts have in \nessence been captives of certain trial lawyers who literally are \nhurting the practice of law throughout this country by their voracious \ndesire to make money at all costs, under the guise that they are \nhelping consumers and those who are injured, when in fact the people \nwho are primarily being helped are really those particular trial \nlawyers who have been doing this.\n  I can remember in one State, in a contest over a Supreme Court \nnomination, where there was a reformer running for the Supreme Court \nand the other person was a total captive of certain trial lawyers in \nthat State. In one evening, 15 trial lawyers raised over $1\\1/2\\ \nmillion for their clone, for their captive, for the person who would \nrule for the plaintiffs no matter what the law said, or no matter what \nthe law meant. Now, that is wrong. We are trying to resolve these \nproblems with this particular bill.\n  My colleague from Tennessee is very sincere in this amendment. I have \nsome feelings about it myself, because I personally do not want to see \ninjured parties unable to receive adequate compensation for the \ninjuries they suffered. On the other hand, I do not want to see \neverybody else in America irked because we will not curtail some of the \nabuses that really go on in trial practice every day.\n  I am also very concerned because I think some of these lawyers are \nreally hurting my beloved profession. To some of them, these problems \ndo not mean anything. It is just a voracious desire to make money at \nthe expense of really virtually everybody. I think it is time to get \nsome system that works, that is fair, that still protects the injured \nparties, but does not run away, like our current system has been doing \nin a great number of States.\n  Now, there are few States where it is just outrageous, and in a great \nnumber of States we are finding outrageous punitive damage awards from \ntime to time. In some States, it is almost all of the time. As I said, \nit has become a rule rather than an exception to plead for punitive \ndamages, even in cases where formerly there would be no real claim at \nall. I think it is time to do something about this. I hope our \ncolleagues will vote against this amendment, as sincere as it is, and \nas well argued as the distinguished Senator from Tennessee has done it.\n  I respect him, I respect what he is trying to do, I respect our \nprofession, and I respect trial lawyers. Most trial lawyers are very \ndecent, honorable people who want to do the job for their clients. They \nwant to do what is right. But there are a few who are distorting the \nprofession and I think making a mockery out of trial law and out of the \ndamages system of this country. That is what we are trying to resolve \nand trying to solve with this legislation. There is no simple way of \ndoing it. This is the best way I know how.\n  To that degree, I want to praise the two leaders on the floor, \nSenators Rockefeller and Gorton, for the excellent efforts they have \nmade in order to try to keep this bill together, get it passed, and to \nget legislation that might help solve some of these vicious tort \nproblems in our society today.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from the State of \nUtah for his very nice closing sentence and also his general argument.\n  Mr. President, I have been--in case nobody has noticed--trying to \nenact what I call moderate product liability for many years--8 or 9--\nbecause I am convinced that consumers and businesses alike are ill \nserved by the current disjointed State-by-State legal system.\n  Under this patchwork system of State laws that we have--glorified by \nthose who propose this--victims are forced to wait far too long for \ncompensation after their injury, and far too often it is the lawyers \nwho benefit more from the awards, the settlements received, than the \nvictims, which is not what I thought America was about.\n  This is simply unjust. I am absolutely convinced that the flow of \ngoods in interstate commerce is severely hampered by the patchwork of \nproduct liability laws across this Nation. Businesses of every size and \ntype simply have no way of knowing, under the current system, what \nrules they need to follow. How could they? They have 50 States to deal \nwith. Businesses are hard pressed these days, small businesses in \nparticular. This is especially onerous on those same small and startup \nenterprises which, in my State of West Virginia and most of the rest of \nthe Nation, are in fact the backbone of the economy. I daresay that the \nPresiding Officer would say that that is true for his State of Montana.\n  The amendment by the Senator from Tennessee, the very distinguished \nSenator Thompson, seeks to limit the bill's application to only those \ncases brought in Federal court. Make no mistake about it, this \namendment would effectively kill product liability reform. It is a bill \nkiller.\n  The reasons we must reject this amendment are the very same reasons \nwe need product liability reform in the first place. I have stated that \nmany times during the debate. The overwhelming majority--and this was \nsaid more ably by my colleague from the State of Washington, Senator \nGorton--about 95 percent of product liability cases, are brought in \nState courts now. He suggests that number might go down closer to 1 \npercent. They would be totally untouched if this amendment were \napproved.\n  Additionally, it is very likely that even fewer cases would be \nbrought in Federal courts because plaintiffs would keep their options \nopen for forum shopping, as we call it, for better rules in some other \nState courts.\n  Consumers lose under the current system and that would not change if \nthe Thompson amendment were adopted. Why do they lose? Consumers lose \nbecause they receive inadequate compensation under current State law. \nConsumers lose because they have to wait far too long to receive \ncompensation.\n  Far too often, injured consumers are forced into poverty while \nwaiting for their cases to be resolved. They have to depend on their \nown insurance or their own individual resources, if they have any.\n  Consumers lose because they are forced to pay outrageous legal fees \nunder a State-by-State system. Consumers also lose because the \npatchwork of State statutes of limitation are so severe under the \ncurrent law and result in barring legitimate claims. That is the \nsubject I will discuss in a moment.\n  The underlying bill would correct these problems by replacing the \nState-by-State patchwork with a far more uniform system. The Thompson \namendment would completely unravel that new uniform system.\n  In earlier debate, I have also set forth why manufacturers lose under \nthe current State-by-State system. But I think this bears repeating. \nManufacturers lose simply because they face unpredictable and \nescalating costs of litigation. These stifle research, these stifle \ndevelopment, they prevent investment, they cause products to be \nwithdrawn, they cause products not to \n[[Page S6058]] be improved, and they cost--guess what--jobs.\n  We have been working hard, very hard. The Senator from Washington and \nSenators on his side of the aisle and Senators on my side of the aisle \nhave been working very, very hard to find the right balance.\n  Senator Gorton is not an extremist. The Senator from West Virginia is \nnot an extremist. We are trying to find the right balance between \nconsumers, plaintiffs, and businesses, with a special attention to \nsmall businesses, which is the majority of our businesses. We have been \nworking very, very hard to find that right balance, to assure that the \nrights of the injured are fully protected while we meet the needs of \nbusiness to manufacture and to invest.\n  We need both in this country. A person cannot just say, well, it is \nonly consumers that count and business does not count, because if we \ndid not have business, nobody would work. They would have no income. It \nis also equally silly to say it is only business that counts, because \nthen that might take America back to a day when business practiced \ndifferently than they do today.\n  We have developed, I think, in America, a system whereby we try to \nprotect consumers, and we do in the bill that the Senator from \nWashington and I suggest. The Gorton-Rockefeller substitute strikes \nthat important balance for consumers and business. The Thompson \namendment, I say again, would destroy that balanced solution.\n  The amendment of the Senator from Tennessee has a familiar and, I \nthink, a very curious ring to it: Familiar because so far, the only \nsuggestion concerning the problems of the product liability maze that I \nhave heard from the opponents to this bill is the idea embodied in this \namendment; curious because where is the logic in limiting the surgery \nproposed in our product liability bill to the equivalent of only one \nfinger, when the problem plagues both hands?\n  We should face it. This amendment is based on a refusal to \nacknowledge the ridiculous cost, delays, and burdens of a very big \nproblem called the patchwork of 55 sets of product liability rules and \nlaws across the States and the territories.\n  I might add at this point that in earlier years, in hearings in the \nCommerce Committee, those opposing product liability reform always said \nthat there will be this massive confusion if we have some kind of \nuniformity at the Federal level in certain areas, everything else being \nreserved to the States, which we do in this bill.\n  They always say, well, imagine a higher court trying to interpret 50 \nsets of laws. It is a specious argument. It needs to be said that it is \na specious argument.\n  Right now, we are plagued by the 50 sets of laws, all different, to \nall States. So people forum shop, and I guess it is fairly well-known \nthat if a person wants to go for punitive damages, there are three \nStates to go to, and that is where most of the amount of the punitive \ndamages come from. If they can find a way to drag somebody in--and \nAlabama is one of those States, curiously, ironically, interestingly--\nthen people go there and they get very good results. There are two \nother States, in particular, also.\n  The point is that the Federal courts will not take very long--and a \nFederal judge pointed this out a couple of years ago--to figure out \nwhen we get uniformity and they have to take these 50 State laws, that \nthere will now only be one law in a certain area and 50 laws in other \nareas.\n  It will not be confusing very long. It is permanently confusing now \nbecause everybody is running all over the place. Judges are smart \nfolks. They do not get there because they cannot pass an SAT test; they \nget there because they are smart and they have to figure things out \nquickly. They will be able to do it.\n  This will actually make the whole process of interpreting State laws \neasier, more efficient, and better. Let that be said, because it has \nnot been said in this debate. The argument that uniformity somehow \nconfuses this by throwing open all of these State laws is specious. I \npick that word for no particular reason.\n  I suggest to the Senators opposing the bill before the Senate and \nsupporting this amendment, they should both vote against the amendment \nof the Senator from Tennessee.\n  Face it: This amendment guts the purpose of this product liability \nreform bill. We are trying to respond to problems that States on their \nown simply cannot fix themselves. What can the State legislature of \nWest Virginia, for example, do about the fact that most of my State \nmanufacturers sell their products in other States, where the rules \ndealing with punitive damages, with joint and several liability, with \nthe statute of limitations, et cetera, come in every conceivable form? \nIt is chaos.\n  I hear the Senator from Tennessee talk about innovation in the \nStates, and I want to get on to the subject of innovation, since we do \nnot have a time agreement on this. And I think the Senator from \nWashington and I would be glad to agree to a time agreement if any \nperson shows any interest.\n  Let me discuss a little bit about product liability. I think the \nreason why the bill needs to pass and why I think the bill will pass, \nis that consumers lose, Mr. President, under the current system. \nConsumers receive inadequate compensation. That is, people who are \ninjured, through product litigation, severely injured people--\nconsumers--only recover about one-third of their actual damages.\n  Just think about that, severely injured, chewed up in a machine, or \nsomething of that sort, and they end up averaging only about a third of \nwhat they should actually get. While those who are mildly injured, who \nare also important, recover approximately five times their economic \nlosses. That is totally unjust. And anyone on this floor who would \ndefend that should choose not to.\n  Consumers have to wait a long time to get any kind of justice under \nthe current system. Injured consumers in need of assistance must suffer \nthrough approximately 3 years of litigation before they receive a \nnickel of compensation. That is not the American way. And where we can \nimprove it we ought to do so.\n  Consumers pay outrageous costs. To put it another way, the current \ntort system which rules the Nation at this point, and which the Senator \nfrom Washington and I are trying reasonably and in a balanced fashion \nto change, pays more to lawyers than it does to claimants. It pays more \nto lawyers than it does to claimants? Yes. That is wrong. This is \nAmerica--that is wrong.\n  If there are those on this floor who choose to defend that and say \nthat is good for injured people, that is good law, that is exactly the \nway we should leave the law, that we should leave that entirely \nunfettered so that lawyers make more off of this than do the people who \nare injured whom they purport to be defending, then let them defend \nthat. Let them defend that. I am interested in their argument. They \nalways talk about something else. They bring up Victor Schwartz, or \nthey bring up some little thing here or there, but they never defend \nthese things because they cannot, because they are dead wrong and they \nknow it.\n  Another reason we need to change the product liability system in this \ncountry is because consumers face closed courthouse doors. What do I \nmean by that? A lot of people who are injured in this country by a \nproduct cannot file a claim because of something called the statute of \nlimitations. I am not a lawyer, but I at least know what that means. \nAnd if, for example, I am injured in Virginia, my time for filing a \nclaim runs out after 2 years from the time that I am injured.\n  I have had several debates with the Senator from California, Senator \nBoxer, about DES. She has said anybody involved with DES hates this \nbill. She has used that word many times--hates this bill. Hates the \nbill. Hates the product liability reform bill the Senator from \nWashington and I are trying to get passed.\n  What I cannot seem to make clear enough is that under our bill, \nanybody who faced the kind of problems that somebody who faces DES \nfaces, or somebody who faces asbestos, or somebody who faces some other \nkind of toxic harm or chemical harm--the Persian Gulf war syndrome, \nagent orange, all of this--wherein they do not discover they are \ninjured for maybe 4 years, 5 years, 6 years, 7 years, 12 \n[[Page S6059]] years, in our bill we say the statute of limitations, \nthat is the time you can make application to file suit against the \nmanufacturer, that person who injured you or that company that injured \nyou--the two year limitation--should not start until you know that you \nare injured and you know what caused your injury. Which means all the \nDES people would have been fine under our bill, while they are \ncompletely cut off under the current law if the State has a statute of \nlimitations which runs out, as most of them do, before DES would have \nbeen discovered.\n  I posit that, as lawyers say. I posit that. It is fact. People can \nsay it is not true, I do not like the bill. There is a mindset around \nhere on this whole subject which is very surprising and disturbing to \nme. I think this is not true--reasonable people, I am just looking at \nthe Senator from Tennessee whom I consider a very reasonable person. I \nthink he is thoughtful, he weighs things. But a lot of people in the \nfighting of this battle over the years have become so hardline that any \nkind of a change, any suggestion of a new fact, any suggestion that \nmaybe the law could be improved, brings 100 percent disapproval and \nanger.\n  It is like somebody just puts out an idea and somebody is afraid the \nidea might be good so they immediately squash the idea. They just pound \nit down into the ground with their fists and crush the idea for fear it \nmight be good or develop into something which is good and useful for \nthe American people and for business.\n  It is a tendency which I regret in this body, which I do not consider \nworthy of the U.S. Senate. It is encouraged, I think, by a sort of \nhard-line mentality, and a lack of civility even, in discussing all of \nthis.\n  Again, we want to open the courthouse doors through the statute of \nlimitations. The opponents want the courthouse doors closed. Let them \nexplain otherwise. Let them explain otherwise.\n  States with statutes of limitation that begin to run out at the time \nof injury, there are four of them: Arkansas, Virginia, Hawaii, Wyoming.\n  States with statutes of limitation which begin to run when the injury \nis discovered or should have been discovered, there are 16 of them. So \nthat does not mean when the cause was discovered, that just means when \nthe injury was discovered. That is not enough. It has to be when it was \ndiscovered and when the cause was discovered. We know from the Persian \nGulf war veterans--and I do not know whether this applies to them or \nnot--but we know they know when they are sick. But we also know that \nthe U.S. Government and Department of Defense says that they are not \nsick. I go visit them and their hands are trembling, they cannot sleep, \nthey cannot keep their marriages together, they are tired all day, they \ncannot keep their jobs, and they cannot focus their eyes on a newspaper \nfor more than 5 minutes. But the Department of Defense says there is \nnothing wrong.\n  I beg to differ because I visit these people when I go back to my \nState of West Virginia, because I care about this and this is a cause \nof mine, to unmask Persian Gulf war syndrome. They know they are sick, \nbut they cannot say why. What caused it? Was it Pyridostigmine? Was it \nsome other kind of vaccine?\n  So you have 16 States--20 States--automatically where people are shut \nout. If those who oppose this legislation want to say, ``We are for \nthat, let them continue to be shut out,'' then let them get up and say \nso. Or if they say I am wrong, the Senator from West Virginia is wrong, \nthen let them get up and say that. Let them get up and say we do not \nopen the courthouse doors and that they do not close them--as they do, \nthe courthouse doors--and keep them closed.\n  It is cruel. It does not make sense. It is based upon old-time life \nwhen it was all machines. Now a lot of the stuff is chemicals, toxins, \nand all kinds of things. That is where a lot of accidents happen. The \nindustrial age has evolved. Just as you can sue somebody under current \nlaw for a piece of machinery that was built in the 19th century and \nthat has passed through 15 different owners, all of whom have altered \nit. That was made for that time, that generation, that industrial \nrevolution period. That idea is not made for the current times at all.\n  So we are trying to open the courthouse doors to consumers. \nManufacturers lose under this current system. We are talking about \npeople and manufacturers, yes, a balanced bill. Liability stifles \nresearch and development. This country is great because of our research \nand development, our spirit, our entrepreneurial spirit, which is \nembodied in research and development. Japan does not do basic research. \nThe United States does. Then they come and buy it from us, or we sell \nit to them, however you want to characterize it. And on that the \nSenator from South Carolina would agree. We sell them our technology. \nBut we do the basic research. That is the heart of America's greatness, \nthe basic research we have done and the uses to which we put it.\n  But because of the current law, the fact is that many businesses \nspend far more money on litigation than they do on research and \ndevelopment. That is bad for business. That is bad for America. The \nfact remains that many companies these days--I think it is something \nlike 47 percent of companies--have withdrawn products because of \nlitigation fears. And a lot of companies now, if this is possible to \nbelieve, are afraid to improve their current products because by the \nact of improving their current products, it would imply that the \nprevious iteration of that product was somehow defective and, \ntherefore, they could be sued and, therefore, they do not improve the \nproduct so they cannot be sued. How ridiculous. How unlike America. If \nthose who oppose this bill want to defend that, then let them go ahead \nand do that.\n  Phyllis Greenberger, who is the executive director of the Society for \nAdvancement of Women's Health Research, in testimony before the Senate \nCommerce Committee on March of this year said:\n\n       Liability concerns are stifling research and development of \n     products for women.\n\n  She said:\n\n       Contraceptive development in the U.S. provides an excellent \n     example of how the threat of litigation can devastate an \n     entire industry. Thirty years ago there were 13 companies in \n     this country putting their resources towards research and \n     development of new contraceptives. Today, there are only two.\n\n  And then what does she say?\n\n       This is not because there is no market demand. Liability \n     concerns are keeping products which have already been \n     developed off the market despite a known therapeutic need.\n\n  I will use an example which I have used before. It is a very good \none. It is Benedictine.\n\n       Benedictine is the only prescription medicine ever approved \n     in the United States for the treatment of nausea and vomiting \n     during pregnancy. None other has ever been approved. It was \n     approved by the Food and Drug Administration. The drug was \n     used by 30,000 women until assertions arose that it caused \n     birth defects. While scientific evidence failed to \n     demonstrate any link and the FDA continued to back the \n     product.\n\n  Remember this is still Phyllis Greenberger talking:\n\n       While . . . the FDA continued to back the product, the \n     manufacturer voluntarily removed Benedictine from the market \n     due to the overwhelming cost of defending the product. \n     Currently, therefore, there is no approved product available \n     to treat pregnant women who experience severe and prolonged \n     nausea, which can be harmful to the mother and to the fetus.\n\n  If that is what the opponents of this legislation want, let them \ndefend it. They are using Benedictine all over the world--all over the \nworld but not in the good old U.S.A. because of the fear of product \nliability litigation under our present system, which some of us are \ntrying to change.\n  I think the United States loses under the current system. Insurance \nrates disable U.S. manufacturers. American manufacturers pay 10 to 50 \ntimes more for product liability insurance than their foreign \ncompetitors.\n  You have the European Economic Community, which has adopted uniform \nproduct liability laws. I believe, although I am not 100 percent sure, \nthat 60 affiliated countries have done the same.\n  So we will continue to pay as a country 10 to 50 times more in \ninsurance because we have all of these State laws, which all compete \nwith each other, and other countries will have a uniform law, and they \nall will be our main competitors for exports and imports in this \n[[Page S6060]] world. And who loses? The American people, the American \nworkers, American business. America loses.\n  In a single year, Mr. President, the liability system cost the State \nof Texas 79,000 jobs. If that is the case, then let those who want to \nsee that current system continue to get up and defend it. When people \nrun for office, they talk about the need for jobs. Texas is losing jobs \nbecause of this. They have a lot of research and development in Texas, \nwhich is a very progressive, industrial State. So they are very much \nhurt by this.\n  Interestingly, when I say the United States loses under the current \nsystem, part of this is that the current system does not enhance \nproduct safety. I will have something to say about that. I would beg \nthose listening to listen to this one sentence.\n  Though the number of torts--that is, suits--in product liability rose \ndramatically in the 1980's, consumer interest steadily declined during \nthe 1980's as it did during the 1970's. So to link this with product \nsafety is open to some substantial question.\n  Let me just make some more points. I go back to this problem of \ninjured people having to wait so long to receive compensation. Mr. \nPresident, after I ran for Governor of West Virginia, an event little \nnoticed and not long remembered, I gave my inaugural speech on the \nsteps of the capitol. It was on a day in which the temperature was 37 \ndegrees below zero. So in order for me to say it, I had to really mean \nit because people were just freezing all over the place. I made four \npromises to the people of West Virginia. I talked about education. I \ntalked about roads. I said I wanted to remove the sales tax from food, \nat that time 3 percent, which I eventually moved to zero. And I wanted \nto make the workers compensation system, which at that time we called \nthe workmen's compensation system, more efficient because I was \noffended that in the State of West Virginia when a worker was injured \nit took the State 77 days on average to get a check to an injured \nworker. I said, how can we be a humane State and do that? And I pledged \nin my inaugural address, which is sort of like your constitution, that \nI would get it done in 4 days.\n  Well, I did. I got it down to 4 days. If I am offended by the 77 days \nit took under the old West Virginia workers compensation system, what \nam I meant to feel about a 3-year period of time on average for an \ninjured worker under U.S. laws, and State law in particular, to receive \ncompensation for the first time. Three years later.\n  An Insurance Service Office study found that it took 5 years to pay \nclaims with the average dollar loss and that ``larger claims''--that \nis, the more seriously injured victims--``tend to take much longer to \nclose than the smaller ones.''\n  Now, this is interesting. ``Several injured victims cannot afford to \nwait years to receive compensation.'' So what do they do, Mr. \nPresident? They know they are going to have to wait a long time while \nthe lawyers rake in the money and they wait. They know they are going \nto have to wait a long time. They know they do not have the resources. \nSo what do they have to do? The delays force them to settle, to not use \nthe system as it is meant to be used but to settle for inadequate \namounts of money. That is shameful. That is shameful. If those who \noppose this bill want to stand up and defend that, I will be here to \nhear their argument. That is shameful. They have to settle because they \nknow they cannot go through the business of paying the lawyers the \nmoney.\n  Let us talk about the business of bringing the lawsuit, and costs \nbeing so high. The GAO--who I think people respect pretty much \nthroughout this Hill--estimated that 50 to 70 cents of every jury-\nawarded dollar goes to lawyers and legal costs. Fifty to 70 cents of \nevery jury-awarded dollar goes to lawyers and legal costs. That is \nwonderful news for the injured person. It leaves him or her maybe 30 \ncents, maybe 50 cents. They are hurt. They are the ones hurting. The \nlawyers are just running these things through.\n  I am not picking on trial lawyers in particular. I have always made a \npoint of saying lawyers on both sides--the trial lawyers and defense \nlawyers. They are both part of the act. Defense lawyers are very, very \ngood at stringing it out, putting in more paper, asking for more \ninformation. They are very, very good at it. But the point is the \npeople do not get the money. The injured person does not get the money. \nThe lawyers and the legal process get the money.\n  A further illustration came in 1994 in a survey by the Association of \nManufacturing Technology. This is hard to follow, so I would ask people \njust listen. It found that every 100 claims filed against its members \nresult in outlays of $4.45 million in defense costs and $8 million in \nsubrogation paid to employers or their workers compensation insurers. \nClaimants, therefore, received only $8.35 million of these 100 claims \nin the Association of Manufacturing Technology survey, and since \nplaintiffs' attorneys usually received one-third of the awards, injured \npeople get to keep about $2.2 million while transaction and legal costs \ntotaled $8.6 million.\n  Something that bothers me greatly about the current system is that \nthe current system discourages the development of innovative products.\n  This is where I got off when I was talking about the amendment of the \nSenator from Tennessee. I used the word ``innovation'' in the States. \nThe chairman and CEO of Biogen, Jim Vincent, stated to the Senate \nCommerce Committee in September 1993 that he has decided not to pursue \nresearch into the development of an AIDS vaccine because of the current \nU.S. product liability system.\n  The Immune Response Corp. of California is attempting to develop an \nAIDS vaccine, but in 1992 it had to delay important clinical trials \nbecause of liability concerns, and I believe they are not doing it \nanymore.\n  An Office of Technology Assessment study found that liability fears \nare a barrier to research testing and marketing of AIDS vaccines and \ncalled for Federal action.\n  Health Industry Manufacturers Association Vice President Ted Mannon \ntold a House Energy and Commerce subcommittee that joint liability law \nis having an adverse effect on the ability of medical device \nmanufacturers to obtain biomaterials--the raw materials that make \nproducts such as hip replacements and pacemakers.\n  I will just do one or two more of these.\n  In 1994, April 25, the New York Times reported:\n\n       Big chemical companies and other manufacturers of materials \n     used to make heart valves, artificial blood vessels, and \n     other implants have been quietly warning medical equipment \n     companies that they intend to cut off deliveries because of \n     fear of lawsuits.\n\n  Now, if we simply want to stop that stuff and the people who have \npacemakers and all the things that we can do in modern medicine do not \nmatter anymore, then let those who oppose this bill defend that; that \nthe very essence of modern research and the very essence of modern \nmedical innovation is being cut off or cut down or cut back or cut out \nby the product liability system that we currently have in this country.\n  One more. The fear of exposure to product liability lawsuits again \nhas diminished investment in basic scientific research. The reason I \nmention the word ``basic'' is because it has always distinguished us \nfrom other countries. We are the ones who do the basic research. The \nother countries do the applied research, particularly Japan, and Asian \ncountries. We do the really hard stuff, which costs a lot of money. You \ndo the basic research and you come up with materials or products or \npossibilities. Then during the applied research and getting it to \ncommercialization--here the Senator from South Carolina and I would \nagree completely--that has been our American problem, the \ncommercialization of products. But not basic research. That has been \nour strength.\n  Well, Mark Skolnick, who is a professor of biophysics at the \nUniversity of Texas, has noted that areas where litigation has occurred \nwill not receive support for exploration and development. Producers \nfearful of possible suits simply make that impossible.\n  The Conference Board, as I indicated earlier, said that 47 percent of \nU.S. companies have withdrawn products from the marketplace because of \nproduct liability concerns.\n  Gallup, in a 1994 survey, said that one in five small business \nexecutives report \n[[Page S6061]] that they have decided not to introduce a new product or \nnot to improve an existing one out of concern for product liability \nlitigation.\n  What are we doing to ourselves, Mr. President? Why is it that such a \nsmall group can prevent our country from progressing while, at the same \ntime, we protect our people?\n  I want to say a word about punitive damages.\n  I want to discuss the punitive damages concept, what it actually is, \nso that it becomes clearer.\n  Again, I am not a lawyer, so I have to look at these things from the \npoint of view of somebody who is not a lawyer. I do not think the \nPresiding Officer is a lawyer, although he has all the attributes \nsometimes of that kind of sharp insight. But, as far as I know, I do \nnot think he is a lawyer. There are a few of us in this body who are \nnot.\n  The U.S. Supreme Court--which I do not consider to be a trivial \nbody--has said that punitive damages have run wild in the United \nStates.\n  Jay Rockefeller, representing the people of West Virginia, did not \nsay that. The U.S. Supreme Court said that.\n  There are virtually no standards for when punitive damages may be \nawarded under the current law and no clear guidelines as to their \namount. Good behavior is swept in with bad. The result is uncertainty \nand instability and a chilling effect on innovation.\n  Now, I go back to Science magazine, 1992. A Science magazine article \nreported that at least two companies have delayed AIDS vaccine research \nand another company abandoned one promising approach as a result of \nliability concerns.\n  European parents can place children in built-in baby seats in cars. \nAmerican parents cannot as easily, because the companies who make baby \nseats do not want to improve them on the fear that they will get sued \nbecause a previous iteration might therefore have been inferred to have \nbeen deficient. That's crazy.\n  So clear, rational rules are needed to promote innovation and \nresponsible manufacturing practices while, at the same time, providing \nassurances that wrongdoers will be justly punished and deterred from \nfuture misconduct.\n  Please let us not have this as an argument between those who care \nabout business and those who care about consumers. In fact, and I \nbelieve my colleague from the State of Washington would agree, those of \nus who are trying to reform the system care a whole lot more and are \nwilling to do a whole lot more to help plaintiffs who are injured than \nare those who oppose this. Although they claim that they wear the halo \nfor consumers, they do not. We are trying to help them. They are trying \nto keep the system as it is. They say that status quo is perfect; just \nleave it exactly as it is.\n  I have not done it every year, but I have routinely called in the \nAmerican Trial Lawyers Association to my office to say: ``Is there some \nway that we can work with you to try to work out some compromise on \nthis subject?'' The answer has always been no. Clear, but not \nencouraging. No. Into which I read, therefore, they want the system to \nbe exactly as it is. Little changes? Big changes? Halfway changes? No. \nNo changes. No changes.\n  I remember once one of the leaders of one of the consumer groups \nseveral years ago brought a woman from West Virginia who had been \ninjured to my office. I guess the idea was to shame me, and to show me \nwhat anguish I had caused this woman. She came in and I saw them.\n  And at the end of the meeting, the woman was in fact sobbing, holding \nonto my hand, saying, ``Your bill would have helped me, perhaps saved \nme.''\n  Now, the leader of the consumer group was, obviously, at something of \na loss. But I have to note that, for the Record, this is the case.\n  So a clear understanding of the nature of punitive damages is an \nessential prerequisite to meaningful reform. Punitive damages are \npunishment. They are quasi-criminal in nature and developed in England \nand the United States to serve as an auxiliary or helper to the \ncriminal law. They have nothing to do with compensating a person who \nhas been harmed and are not in any way intended to make the plaintiff \nwhole. That purpose is served by compensatory damages, which provide \nrecovery for both economic--which is lost wages--and medical expenses.\n  Let me make a point here, too. A lot of people say, ``Oh, economic \ndamages. Persons making $35,000 a year. They are 30 years old. Now they \ncannot work.'' Which, of course, is horrible, if it comes to that.\n  But they say, ``Well, gee; I guess that is going to be $35,000 for \neconomic wages.'' No, no, no. It is $35,000 for every year that that \nperson would have deemed to have been able to work, plus all benefits, \nplus all retirement, and all the rest of it.\n  In fact, if you did that, let us say somebody was making $30,000 a \nyear, and is 30 years old. They could work for another 35 years. I am \nnot very good at math, but that would be many, hundreds of thousands of \ndollars; way above $250,000.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. Will the Senator yield for a point?\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Yes.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. Was the Senator present when I made my statement \nconcerning the family who visited me in my office concerning their 5-\nyear-old daughter recently?\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. I apologize; I was not here.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. You mentioned the lady who was sobbing in your office. \nIt reminded me of that visit I had last week. It was a family from \nNashville who had lost their 5-year-old daughter. She had gone in for a \nroutine tonsillectomy. One error followed another; many, many things \nwent wrong. The clinic was hiring on the cheap. They had a drug addict \nthere administering to this person.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Is the Senator discussing product or malpractice?\n  Mr. THOMPSON. Well, this is part of the underlying bill, as I \nunderstand it, the McConnell amendment.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. I was trying to discuss product.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. Well, the Senator was talking about punitive damages, \nand that is the subject of my question.\n  And then the clinic sought to cover up. Finally, one of them called \n911.\n  They did several things totally, totally that would constitute gross \nmisconduct. They finally called 911, and then tried to cover up the \nrecords. They were caught. A lawyer represented them, charged 30 \npercent, incidentally, financed the litigation out of his own pocket \nfor 2 years because the plaintiffs did not have the money to do that. \nFinally, they got to court. The defense, the insurance company, would \nnot settle the case until they got to court. The mother broke down in \ncourt and they found out what they were up against in there and settled \nthe case for $3 million.\n  Under this legislation, if this passed, I wonder what the Senator \nwould tell that sobbing mother who was in my office last week in terms \nof whether or not we ought to tell the State of Tennessee they cannot \nallow a jury in Tennessee any longer to make that kind of award in a \npunitive damage case.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. My answer to the distinguished Senator from \nTennessee is that this particular Senator is trying to work to find a \nway in which there will not be caps as classically defined on punitive \ndamages.\n  I say to the Senator from Tennessee that I voted, for example, with \nSenator Dorgan on his amendment to remove caps. And the Senator did \nthat for a very specific purpose, because I think we can find a way, \nbecause I do not think we can pass the bill without finding that way, \nand I am convinced that we can find a way to do this so that I would \nhave been as comfortable or as uncomfortable in that room with your \nconstituent as I was with mine.\n  Now, I also want to say, when I talk about pain and suffering, the \nState of Washington has no punitive damages whatsoever. They have no \npunitive damages. Is it not interesting then that within the last 6 \nweeks that the State of Washington came down with a jury award for \neconomic and pain and suffering of $40 million?\n  The only reason I mention that is to say, one, that economic is much \nmore than people think of it as. It is the rest of your life's wages. \nIt includes the raises that you might have gotten. It even presumes \npromotions you might have gotten, as well as the benefits, insurance, \nretirement and all the rest of it.\n  But pain and suffering is where a jury can get very subjective and \nwhere \n[[Page S6062]] a jury does often get very subjective in a proper way \nand, in this case, a $40 million award. I do not think anybody who \nopposed this bill could have guessed there would have been a $40 \nmillion award out of a State that does not even have punitive damages. \nThat happened 6 weeks ago in Washington.\n  So, Senator Gorton's and my bill understands and accepts the basic \npremise that punitive damages are punishment and provides the \nfundamentals that are part of any criminal punishment; a definition of \nthe crime establishing a level of proof necessary for punishment and \nmaking the sentence fit the crime. So let us define the crime.\n  S. 565 defines the crime as conduct specifically intended to cause \nharm or conduct manifesting a conscious, flagrant indifference to the \nsafety of those persons who might be harmed by the product. The \nstandard is fair and is similar to the standards of many States, in \nfact. It conveys that punitive damages are to be awarded only in the \nmost serious cases of extremely outrageous conduct.\n  Level of proof: S. 565 explains how a claimant must prove the crime \nand requires that the proof be clear and convincing. This standard \nreflects, I think properly, a middle ground between the burden of proof \nstandard ordinarily used in civil cases, which is proof by a \nreponderance of the evidence and criminal law standard which is proof \nbeyond a reasonable doubt. So this is in between, clear and convincing.\n  The U.S. Supreme Court has endorsed clear and convincing evidence \nburden of proof standards in punitive damage cases. In addition, each \nof the principal groups to analyze the law of punitive damages since \n1979 has recommended the standard, including the American Bar \nAssociation, which the Senator from South Carolina mentioned some time \nago is bipartisan if anything ever was bipartisan, and the American \nCollege of Trial Lawyers.\n  Recently, the standard was recommended in a 5-year study of scholars \nby the American Law Institute and, incidentally, the standard is now \nlaw in 24 States.\n  Making the sentence fit the crime: Most importantly, we try to put \nreasonable parameters on sentencing to make it fit the crime; an \nestablished principle of law. Even very serious crimes, such as \nlarceny, robbery and arson have sentences defined with a maximum \nsentence in statute.\n  As a result of adopting the amendment by the Senator from Maine and \ndrawing on the interest expressed by colleagues on this side, we \nmodified the bill to allow punitive awards to go as high as two times \ncompensatory damages.\n  Opponents to this bill have argued that unlimited punitive damages \nare necessary to police corporate wrongdoing. Absolutely unlimited. \nThis is not necessarily supported by facts. There is no credible \nevidence that products are any less safe in either those States that \nhave set reasonable limits on punitive damages or in six States--\nLouisiana, Nebraska, Washington, New Hampshire, Massachusetts, and \nMichigan--that do not permit punitive damages at all. In fact, \nBrookings makes no link whatsoever between what is happening in \npunitive damages and product safety. That is an argument which is used \nby the opponents often.\n  Furthermore, plaintiffs in those States have no more difficulty \nobtaining legal representation than in those States where the sky is \nthe limit.\n  I am coming to a close.\n  Bifurcation: This is a general remedy proposed to ease adverse \nimpacts of punitive damages awards that permits a trial to be divided \ninto segments, and this makes sense. The first part of the trial is \naddressing compensatory damages, the second dealing with punitive \ndamages.\n  One has to do with helping the person. The second with punishing the \nmanufacturer. Judicial economy is achieved by having the same jury \ndetermine liability and amounts of both compensatory damages and \npunitive damages.\n  This remedy we give the shorthand name of ``bifurcation.'' \nBifurcation trials are equitable because they prevent evidence that is \nhighly prejudicial and relevant only to the issue of punitive damages--\nthat is, the wealth of the defendant--from being heard by jurors and \nproperly considered when they are determining basic liability. \nBifurcation also helps jurors compartmentalize the trial, allowing them \nto easily separate the lower burden of proof required for compensatory \ndamages and the higher burden of proof, clear and convincing evidence, \nfor punitive damages.\n  So, Mr. President, I will soon yield the floor. First, I simply \nconclude by saying that product liability reform--the bill before the \nSenate--is not a child, a stepchild, not even a foster child of the \nContract With America. It is the result of people of both sides of the \naisle here in the Senate agreeing that the legal system, where it deals \nwith interstate commerce, needs to be fixed, and it is precisely \nCongress' role, and only Congress' role, to step in where the States \ncannot do the job on their own, which is why we need to pass the bill.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  Mr. GORTON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington is recognized.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I want to make a few remarks on the \nThompson amendment. Before that, I want to see whether or not we can \naccommodate a number of Members. Rather than seeking a unanimous-\nconsent agreement on a vote for a time certain, I hope that we will be \nable to debate the Thompson amendment fully. At the same time, there is \nanother amendment that will be proposed by the Senators from Michigan \nand Kentucky. I hope that we will be able to set aside the present \namendment and allow them to speak.\n  I know the Senator from Kentucky is the chairman of the Ethics \nCommittee and must meet with that committee between 4 p.m. and 6 p.m. I \nwould like to know whether or not the proponents of the Thompson \namendment will permit that amendment to be introduced, for them to \nspeak, and then speak back and forth on both of them--however they want \nto utilize their rights to continue debate on in this amendment.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Without objection, I will go along with the \ndistinguished author of the amendment, Senator Thompson. I will need a \nlittle bit of time. You were asking for a time agreement?\n  Mr. GORTON. I will not make a motion to table until the Senator from \nSouth Carolina has all the time he wishes to speak.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. Does the Senator from Kentucky need to proceed before 4 \no'clock? Otherwise, I believe we can finish in short order. We need a \nvery few minutes. I think that will probably wind us up.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I say to my friend from Tennessee that it is my hope \nand the hope of the Senator from Michigan as well, with your \npermission, to call up an amendment we are going to offer for \ndiscussion purposes. It could be stacked or laid aside. It will give \nboth of us a chance to discuss this--in my particular case, the need to \ndiscuss it some time between now and 4 o'clock, because I will not be \navailable for 2 hours after that. I do not know when these are going to \nbe voted on in any event.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. How much time does the Senator from South Carolina \nneed?\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Ten minutes.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. I think I will need approximately the same. Would it be \nall right if we went 20 minutes or so and then brought up the amendment \nof the Senator from Kentucky?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I say to the Senator from Tennessee it is fine with \nme, provided it is all right with the Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. That would be fine.\n  Mr. GORTON. Then I will be relatively short.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I defer to the Senator from Tennessee. He is the \nauthor. If the Chair recognizes me, I can proceed----\n  Mr. GORTON. I think the Senator from Washington has the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Yes, the Senator from Washington has the floor \nat this time.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I wanted to speak briefly on the Thompson \namendment and will do so only relatively briefly to give him some more \nammunition for his wonderful presentation on this subject.\n  I must start my remarks by confessing that he really had me dead \n[[Page S6063]] to rights on one of the comments that he made about the \nimpact of his own amendment. I will have to confess error and then say \nthat I believe that error strengthens my case rather than weakens it.\n  I had said earlier during the course of this debate that the result \nof the passage of this amendment, giving litigants in every State two \nchoices of different laws to enforce would simply mean, because of the \nrestrictions included in the bill here, that all plaintiffs' lawyers \nwould seek to bring their actions in the State courts in order to avoid \nthe restrictions on punitive damages and on joint liability. And the \nSenator from Tennessee quite properly pointed out that there are a \nnumber of instances in which this bill, the Rockefeller-Gorton bill, \ntreats plaintiffs' claimants more liberally than do the laws of various \nStates. He took the statute of repose, which is 20 years in this bill, \n10 to 12 years in most States that have a statute of repose--obviously, \nif the cause of action was based on a piece of machinery or a product \nthat was 15 years old, the choice would be to go into Federal court and \nget the advantage of that more liberal provision. He even spoke about \nmy own State, which does not allow punitive damages and, therefore, \nwould impel the plaintiff to go into Federal court if the plaintiff \nwished punitive damages rather than into the State court.\n  He is correct. There are certainly some cases in which the claimant \nwould have a better climate in which to bring such an action in Federal \nCourt than in State court. But, Mr. President, one of the great vices \nof the present system, one of the vices that this bill--to focus on \nproduct liability for the moment--is designed to deal with is the \nmyriad of 50 different sets of laws and procedures in the courts of 50 \nStates. The justification, as the Senator from Tennessee pointed out \nhimself, for any legislation in the field of product liability is the \ninterstate commerce clause and the desire to smooth commerce among the \nseveral States, to have a degree of predictability.\n  This bill does not attempt to do what bills a decade ago in this \nfield did, and that is to define negligence and strict liability and \ndeal with a number of other matters of substantive law. It calls for \nlimitations only in the field of a statute of repose and joint \nliability and punitive damages and allows more restrictive regimes in \nthe various States to remain enforced. But, certainly, as compared with \nthe present status of the law, there will be a greater degree of \npredictability and a greater degree of uniformity.\n  As the Senator from Tennessee so eloquently pointed out, if his \namendment passes and should become law, instead of having 50 different \nsystems in 50 different States, we would have 100 systems in 50 \ndifferent States. We would double the complexity of the present system, \nbecause he is right--while I am right that in most States most \nplaintiffs would seek out the State court and attempt to avoid this \nlaw, under some circumstances in some States they would seek the \nFederal court in order to avoid the greater restrictions of State law. \nNot only would we not increase predictability and uniformity, we would \ndouble the degree of complexity. And there would be far more gaming of \nthe system.\n  I think that every small business in the United States should greatly \nfear the Thompson amendment, because now at least if the defendant is \nlarge and obviously capable of paying a large judgment, many plaintiffs \nwill only sue the manufacturer of a particular product. That \nmanufacturer will be from a different State than the plaintiff, a case \nwhich under most circumstances could be brought in Federal court. But \nif the plaintiff of the future does not want to be in Federal court, we \ncan bet their sweet life if this is a piece of equipment, a stepladder, \nthe subject of lawsuits, the Ace Hardware Store in the hometown of the \nplaintiff will end up being a defendant.\n  There will be a lot more small business defendants in product \nliability litigation in the future if this amendment passes than there \nare now, because that will be the way to avoid diversity of citizenship \nand bring the action in State court when the State law is more \nfavorable.\n  There will be more defendants, Mr. President. There will be twice as \nmany applicable laws--two in every State in the United States rather \nthan one. And there will be less uniformity and less predictability.\n  Now, Mr. President, it seems difficult for me to imagine any person \nthinking seriously about the practice of law and uniformity who really \nwants to overturn the doctrine in Erie Railroad versus Tompkins, in \n1938, in which the Supreme Court said: ``We are going to end this forum \nshopping. We will say it does not matter whether a person brings the \ndiverse action in State or Federal court; the same law is going to \napply.''\n  This amendment would reverse that doctrine, would double the number \nof applicable laws in the United States, and increase infinitely the \ndegree of forum shopping on the part of claimants' lawyers.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I want to touch on just two or three \nthings quickly, and I want to yield, of course, to the principal author \nof the amendment, the Senator from Tennessee, with respect to punitive \ndamages.\n  The statement was made by Senator Rockefeller that the Supreme Court \nsaid that the punitive damages would just run amok. The fact is, the \nSupreme Court of the United States of America has not turned down or \nreversed punitive damages.\n  The most recent case happens to be a West Virginia case of this \nparticular court, dated June 25, 1993, TXO Production Corp. versus \nAlliance Resources. Actual damages were $19,000, Mr. President. Do you \nknow what the punitive damages were? Punitive damages, $10 million.\n  Do you think that disturbs the Senator from West Virginia, who says \nhe is here for consumers? He is for corporations. They can get all the \npunitive damages they want. They are not subject to this bill. Oh, no; \nas a matter of fact, they are not subject to this bill. The leading \ncase in his own State, $19,000 in actual damages, $10 million in \npunitive damages, upheld by the U.S. Supreme Court.\n  Second, with respect to keeping all the products off the shelf, and \nparticularly as the Senator refers to AIDS and AIDS drugs, and how they \nare all going out of business.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent we have printed in the Record \na statement by Gerald J. Mossinghoff, president of the Pharmaceutical \nManufacturers Association, made last year before the Committee on \nEnergy and Commerce.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                   Statement of Gerald J. Mossinghoff\n\n       Mr. Chairman and Members of the Subcommittee: I am Gerald \n     J. Mossinghoff, President of the Pharmaceutical Manufacturers \n     Association. PMA represents more than 100 research-based \n     pharmaceutical companies--including more than 40 of the \n     country's leading biotechnology companies--that discover, \n     develop and produce most of the prescription drugs used in \n     the United States and a substantial portion of the medicines \n     used abroad. I appreciate the opportunity to appear today at \n     this important hearing on the role of the pharmaceutical \n     industry in healthcare reform.\n       Our companies support President Clinton's goal of assuring \n     healthcare security for all Americans without sacrificing \n     quality of care. To accomplish this goal, comprehensive \n     healthcare reform is needed. Total healthcare costs are \n     rising too fast. And too many people lack coverage for \n     necessary medical care, including prescription drugs. These \n     problems must be addressed.\n       The Administration is to be commended for proposing a \n     comprehensive healthcare-reform plan that addresses all \n     elements of an extremely complex healthcare system. We \n     support strengthening consumer choice among competing private \n     plans, rather than mandating a single-Government payer. We \n     support providing comprehensive benefits, including \n     prescription drugs, for all Americans. We support continuous \n     coverage regardless of illness. We support greater emphasis \n     on prevention and medical outcomes. And we support strong \n     safeguards to ensure quality care. We also are pleased that \n     the Administration has indicated that it will remain flexible \n     and open to constructive suggestions on ways to improve its \n     proposal. We believe that there must be greater reliance on \n     the free competitive market in a reformed healthcare system.\n\n\n                              World leader\n\n       For many years, the pharmaceutical industry's success in \n     developing new and better medicines has made it one of the \n     country's most innovative and internationally competitive \n     industries. The industry has a good chance to remain \n     innovative and competitive--if the incentives for \n     pharmaceutical innovation are preserved.\n       [[Page S6064]] In its 1991 study of the industry, the ITC \n     reported that U.S. firms accounted for nearly two-thirds of \n     the new drugs introduced in the world market during 1940-\n     1988. In his recent study, Heinz Redwood stated, ``The \n     American industry has a clear and outstanding lead in \n     discovering and developing major, medically innovative, \n     globally competitive, and therapeutically accepted new drugs \n     . . . Perhaps the most important finding is that the American \n     lead includes all but one of the therapeutic classes.'' The \n     General Accounting Office, in a September 1992 study, \n     concluded that the pharmaceutical industry maintained its \n     competitive position and strong international leadership \n     during the 1980s, while most other high-technology industries \n     experienced some decline in their position. A report in the \n     March 9, 1992 edition of Fortune magazine placed the \n     pharmaceutical industry at the very top of the list of the \n     country's most internationally competitive industries.\n       In conclusion, we believe the three principles outlined \n     earlier in this statement--coverage, competition and cures--\n     are fully consistent with the six goals specified by \n     President Clinton for his healthcare-reform plan. Our \n     industry firmly believes we can contribute significantly in \n     helping to meet these worthy goals. We look forward to \n     working with this Subcommittee in your efforts to achieve \n     healthcare reform in a way that will accommodate our major \n     concerns.\n       Mr. Chairman, that concludes my prepared Statement. I will \n     be pleased to answer any questions that you or other Members \n     of the Subcommittee may have.\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I will read two sentences. ``For many \nyears''--says the leader of the pharmaceutical industry--\n\n       For many years, the pharmaceutical industry's success in \n     developing new and better medicines has made it one of the \n     country's most innovative and internationally competitive \n     industries.\n\n  In a study of the industry, the ITC reported that U.S. firms \naccounted for nearly two-thirds of the new drugs introduced in the \nworld market during the period 1940 to 1988.\n  Forty-eight years, almost fifty years.\n  There is Fortune Magazine, there is the head of the industry, \nspeaking for itself. Now we will bring it up to date, to February and \nApril of this year.\n  February 23, 1995. I hold in my hand an advertisement entitled ``Drug \nCompanies Target Major Diseases with Record R Investment.'' It is an \nadvertisement by America's pharmaceutical research companies, and I \nread:\n\n       Pharmaceutical companies will spend nearly $15 billion on \n     drug research and development in 1995.\n\n  Remember, the Senator from West Virginia said they are all going out \nof business on account of product liability, and they could not invest. \nThe overwhelming evidence is the opposite of what the Senator from West \nVirginia contends.\n\n       New medicines in development for leading diseases include \n     86 for heart disease and stroke, 124 for cancer, 107 for AIDS \n     and AIDS-related diseases, 19 for Alzheimer's disease, 46 for \n     mental diseases, and 79 for infectious diseases.\n\n  The pharmaceutical industry categorically refutes the statements made \nby the distinguished Senator from West Virginia.\n  Now, going right to less than a month ago, April 5, 1995, another \nadvertisement: ``Who Leads the World in Discovering Major New Drugs,'' \nput out by the America's pharmaceutical research companies.\n\n       Between 1970 and 1992, close to half of the important new \n     drugs sold in major markets around the world were introduced \n     by the U.S. pharmaceutical companies. Here at home, the broad \n     drug industry has been making 9 out of every 10 new drug \n     discoveries. So when a breakthrough medicine is created for \n     AIDS, heart disease, Alzheimer's disease, stroke, cancer, or \n     any other disease, chances are it will come from America's \n     drug and research companies.\n\n  That totally refutes the Senator from West Virginia's statement. Now \nfinally, the arithmetic, simple arithmetic, refutes this pose for the \nconsumer, whereby the consumer is not getting the majority of the \nmoney; the lawyer is getting the majority of the money. Of course, the \ninference is that the injured party, the plaintiff's lawyers, get the \nmoney. Arithmetic says that 33\\1/3\\ percent, which has been agreed to \ngenerally in the debate on both sides of the aisle, and parties pro and \ncon, on a particular measure, 33\\1/3\\ percent is less than 100 percent \nand less than 50 percent, so the other 66\\2/3\\ percent goes to the \nclient.\n  Or take the amendment of the Senator from Kentucky on malpractice: A \n25 percent limitation there; 25 percent leaves 75 percent for the \nclient.\n  Now, what are the facts? Why does the Senator use that distorted \nrepresentation about being so concerned that the consumer is not \ngetting the money he deserves, like every case brought is a winner?\n  No. 1, according to the Rand study of product liability injuries, of \n100 percent injured, we find that only 7 percent of the injured parties \nconsult an attorney; only 4 percent hire an attorney; and only 2 \npercent file a lawsuit. According to the New York Times, one-half of \nthose filing are losing.\n  Now, who pays for all of those expenses, except for the plaintiff's \nattorney? So it gives no regard and no account for our distinguished \ngroup of professionals who are willing to take it on a contingency \nbasis, although they are losing half the time, to try to get middle \nAmerica and poor injured parties their day in court.\n  I can tell you now, come to this town and get injured, do not go \ndowntown on billable hours. I tried to point that out with my \nparticular amendment. You could not afford to hire the lawyer and we \nall know that. But they are being derided here as somehow the lawyers \nare running off with all the money.\n  Where does the money go? According to the National Consumers \nInsurance Organization, according to this survey, in our hearings,\n\n       For every dollar paid to claimants, insurers paid an \n     average of an additional 42 cents in defense costs while for \n     every dollar awarded a plaintiff, plaintiff pays an average \n     contingent fee of 33 cents out of that dollar. Thus, in cases \n     in which the plaintiffs prevail, out of each $l.42 spent on \n     litigation, half of that goes to attorney's fees, with the \n     defendants' attorneys on average paid better than plaintiffs' \n     attorneys.\n\n  They go take it down to where they are getting 56 percent.\n  Now here are the poor plaintiffs' lawyers. They are not even seen but \nin 2 percent of the product liability injury cases, and of the cases \nthey file they are only recovering in half. So they are taking the \nexpenses of the others. You can bet your boots when they finally \nprevail and get their third, that is still 66 2/3 percent going to the \nclient and 33 1/3 percent going to the lawyer. So the lawyers they are \ninterested in trying to restrict and with their amendments have voted \nto limit, they are the ones already in a sense losing.\n  The Senators stand here and say it is shameful? It is shameful to \nmisrepresent the idea that this crowd sponsoring this bill is for the \nconsumer. They know they are for the corporations. They know they are \nfor the insurance companies. They know the drive. It is corporate \nAmerica: Business Round Table, Conference Board, NAM--National \nAssociation of Manufacturers--they have been sponsoring this bill for \n15 years and they know it. No consumer organization has come forward \nwith this bill. All the consumer organizations of size and repute \nabsolutely oppose the bill. To come up here and talk about shame, and \nthe consumers are not getting the money, and misrepresenting the facts \nwith respect to percentage when simple arithmetic shows no one gets \nover a third, and if limited by a vote, 25 percent. That leaves 75 \npercent for the client if they win.\n  And on that contingent fee, that trial lawyer who is representing the \ninjured party has to assume all the costs and all the burden and all \nthe risk. Otherwise that poor injured party would not have a lawyer \nbecause they cannot afford it. They found out $50 an hour was not \nenough. I tried to limit it here in my amendment. So they come forward \nhere in this town with $100 an hour billable hours and going on up to \n$500 and more. They could just never get their day in court. We know \nthat is being cared for back home.\n  That is why I am so interested in the amendment of the Senator from \nTennessee, because we can stop this pell-mell march to Washington with \nthe Washington bureaucrats administering and determining, not hearing \nany of the facts, disregarding the 12 jurors sworn to listen to the \nfacts, bureaucrats who say,\n\n       Forget about you, you all are runaway. You do not know. You \n     have not heard. There is no relief. And it is a national \n     problem and we are going to correct it with this mish-mash \n     bill.\n\n  I favor the amendment of the Senator from Tennessee.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  [[Page S6065]] Mr. THOMPSON. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from \nSouth Carolina for his remarks, which were eloquent as usual. I do \nthink it is important that we refocus on what we are about here. The \ndebate most of this afternoon has gotten off onto who is making the \nmoney, who is supporting who, scare tactics and figures taken out of \nthin air. I do not know where most of these figures are coming from.\n  I would like to refocus on what we are about here. We are about our \njudicial system in this country. There is nobody on the floor here who \ndoes not want a fair system, one that is fair to all parties. We \ncertainly all recognize that manufacturers and sellers of products \nought to be treated fairly and should not be put in a position where \nthey cannot reasonably manufacture products and send them in interstate \ncommerce and not be put out of business unfairly. We also understand \nthat there are innocent people out there, children, other innocent \npeople who sometimes are injured through the negligence and sometimes \nthrough the willful misconduct of large companies. And they need to be \nprotected. We all know that.\n  We are talking about a system here. We are not talking about good \nguys and bad guys. We are talking about a system. What is the system \nthat is best designed to produce a good system of justice across the \nboard for this country?\n  Traditionally, we have had a system where States determine what their \nlaws are. They learn, they change laws, a lot of innovation is going on \nin a lot of different States as has been pointed out here today. \nChanges are being made. Radical changes, in some States, are being \nmade.\n  It has been suggested now that in the area of products liability, \nprimary, we need to take a little bit different look. I am trying to \ntake a little bit different look.\n  My amendment is called a killer amendment. This is the first time, I \nguess, in the history of the Senate, where we have ever gotten a \nproduct liability debate on the floor. I was one of the ones who said I \nwill not support a filibuster. I will support bringing this up on a \nmotion to proceed. I, and people like myself, presumably carried the \nday and we got this debate here. And I am suggesting now an approach \nthat makes sense from the standpoint of what we as a U.S. Congress \nought to be about. Not rewriting all the State laws in this country. \nThat is against our basic philosophy. That is what I campaigned \nagainst, the Washington-knows-best attitude.\n  The Senator from West Virginia makes an eloquent plea for a 2-year \nstatute of limitations. He is entitled to his opinion on a 2-year \nstatute of limitations. I may agree with a 2-year statute of \nlimitations. But why should the people of Tennessee have to follow the \ndictates of the Senator from West Virginia as to what the proper number \nof years for a statute of limitations is? It is just not right. I \ncannot go down that road.\n  Perhaps we can involve ourselves in an area that involves interstate \ncommerce, that involves products; 70 percent of them which travel in \ninterstate commerce and which also involves interstate litigants, if \nyou will. And that is litigants who are in the Federal court because of \ndiversity of jurisdiction, because you have citizens of various States.\n  To me, that makes some sense. That makes some sense. That is not a \nkiller. That is an attempt to legislate in an area that we properly \nlegislate in. I hope we do not, in this area or any other, rush to \njudgment to change longstanding rules or longstanding procedures that \nthe States have enacted over the years, over 200 years, simply because \nof pressures and editorials in newspapers and some rush to judgment.\n  I support the Contract With America. I have simply pointed out that \nthis is the only provision in the Contract With America that goes \nagainst our basic philosophy. All the rest of the Contract With America \nis limiting the Federal Government. It has to do with limiting one \nbranch or another: Term limits, line-item veto. It has to do with \nlimiting the Federal Government with regard to the States. How do we \nhandle our welfare system? With regard to individuals, how much in \ntaxes do we take from them or not? It all has to do with limitations on \nthe Federal Government except this one thing.\n  What I am suggesting is that with regard to these cases that can \nlegitimately be called interstate in nature, with regard to litigants \nwho are legitimately interstate in nature--not because of what I \nthought up but because of what has been the law of this country for \nmany, many years--let us apply some of these things, which are really \nbroad and far reaching in many respects, but let us go ahead and do it. \nLet us go ahead and try it and see and experiment, if you will, and see \nif this is going to save the world as we think it is.\n  I think we have to get straight on our statistics. We keep hearing a \nfigure, some low figure of tort cases that are brought in Federal \ncourt, and that is true. But the indications from the Administrative \nOffice of the U.S. Courts, an unassailable source, are that \napproximately 45 percent of products liability cases are either brought \nin Federal court or removed to Federal court because you have diversity \nof jurisdiction.\n  So is it suggesting that we apply these rules to 45 percent of the \ncases gutting this bill? Or is it saying instead of going 100 percent \novernight, interfering in areas that people who are concerned about \nStates rights and intrusive Federal Government are concerned about, \nthat we take one step at a time. Under my amendment we would have \nuniformity in Federal courts in all States. Under the underlying bill \nyou have caps in various areas but States are still free within those \ncaps, as long as they do not go over the caps, to pass what legislation \nthey want.\n  You still have 50 different States and 50 different State laws. That \nis not uniformity under the underlying bill. At least with regard to \nthe diversity cases you would have uniformity. Is it bad for small \nbusiness because they would be joined in order to defeat diversity? \nWould you have complete diversity? Would you join an interstate \ndefendant? That is happening now. That is what is happening now. The \ncourts have to determine. Are they properly joined in? So be it? You \nfollow the legal consequences from that. If they are, you are in State \ncourt. If they are not properly joined then the court throws them out, \nand you have diversity and you can go to Federal court, if you want to.\n  Applying this to 45 percent of the cases before we rush pell-mell to \ntake over State law in this country is not a killer amendment.\n  I must say that I understand the legitimate points of both sides of \nthis argument. I understand the problems the manufacturers have. I am \ntrying to redress the legitimate problems that manufacturers have in \nthis country. I understand the proponents believe that we need to level \nthe playing field some. But for me it is trying, I say to my friends on \nthe other side, let us at least acknowledge that this is the case and \nthis is what we are doing, and we are trying to level up the playing \nfield.\n  Let us not try to convince the American people that this is a \nconsumer's bill. This is not a consumer's bill. They say this is a \nconsumer's bill because of attorney's fees. Most of the attorney's fees \ndo not go to the litigants. Why is that? Often the defendant company or \nthe insurance company representing them will string out a case for 2 or \n3 years knowing it is a meritorious case causing costs to rise, having \nto pay defense attorney's fees and all of that, and then settle a case. \nThen they complain about the cost of the system.\n  That is what happened to the family that came into my office last \nweek. They had a clear-cut situation where a clinic, if they had been \ntrying to kill their 5-year-old daughter for a routine medical \nprocedure they could not have done it any more efficiently. There was \none mistake after another. A drug addict working on the premises who \nlater OD'd. A comedy of errors; had to call 911; then covered up their \nactivities. I cannot imagine of a more clear-cut case. Yet, it took 2 \nyears, a lawyer having to finance that lawsuit out of his own pocket as \noften happens because they have been dragged around and deposed all \naround, running all the expenses up.\n  Anybody who has ever been involved in this knows the way it happens. \nOnly when the mother got on the witness stand and broke down they said, \nOK, let us settle this case for $3 million. \n[[Page S6066]] Should we be terribly impressed with the defense costs \nand the court costs and also what was involved in that particular piece \nof legislation? Whose fault is that? The parents of that little girl \nlast week in my office who have no further ax to grind, they have no \nmonetary or economic interest in this anymore, in this system, did not \nthink that it was a consumer piece of legislation. They were saying \nplease do not get into a situation where in this unusual case--thank \nGod it does not happen every day. But it does happen. And when that \ndoes happen, let us make sure that we set an example that it does not \npay for a clinic or a manufacturer to hire on the cheap, operate on the \ncheap thinking that they have a situation out here that is going to \nfavor them in court, and they do not have to worry about it too much.\n  Some say it is a consumer bill because of the delays. You are going \nto have more delays under this underlying bill, if it passes, without \nthis amendment than you have ever had before because we are creating \nnew law. In all of the circuits this new law is going to have to be \ninterpreted. There is all kinds of language in there. Every word of it \nwill be subject to court interpretation, new interpretation, new law in \nevery circuit which will then, with regard to that legislation, be \nbinding on the States.\n  Other points that were made: The fact that we have a system with 50 \ndifferent sets of laws in this country with 50 different States. That \nwe do. It is called a Federal system. I kind of like it. I thought most \nof my colleagues kind of liked it. I may have a different idea about \nwhat the statute of limitations ought to be in Tennessee than the \nSenator from West Virginia. People in Tennessee might have different \nideas about a lot of things than other people of other States. They \nhave a right to address those things.\n  The suggestion was made that we could under the present system forum \nshop and go to Alabama, I believe the State was mentioned, and get a \nfavorable situation there. Of course, the practical difficulties of \nthat are well known. To anybody that has gone in the system you are a \nlong way from home. You hire another lawyer. You expand your expenses--\nall of that. But assuming that does happen on occasion, my amendment \nwould prevent that. If a fellow from Tennessee decided he wanted to get \nfavorable State law from Alabama and went to the State of Alabama to \nsue an Alabama defendant, there would be diversity jurisdiction. They \ncould go into Federal court and have the Federal standard apply, not \nthe Alabama State standard.\n  The point is made that products are being restrained from the \nmarketplace under our present system. I am sure that is true to a \ncertain extent. It was said we could have all of these other products \nand people are now making products because of liability laws. Of \ncourse, there are no statistics on that. All of this is what somebody \nsaid. But I will take it at face value. So we do not have all the \nproducts that we otherwise would have if we had a different system.\n  I asked the question. What do we do about that? Assuming that is \ntrue, what do we do about it? Has anybody come up with a solution other \nthan just wringing our hands and saying that products are being \nrestrained? Are we going to say that beforehand you cannot sue these \ncompanies? Are you going to say that we can only bring x number of \nlawsuits a year--citizens of the United States of America--against \nthese companies? Of course, not. You cannot do that.\n  On the other hand, are we going to say what these questions are going \nto be like if anybody gets hurt without any proof of negligence, \nwithout any proof of responsibility? Of course, not. We are not going \nto say that either.\n  What is the solution? The solution has always been let them \nmanufacture their products with the knowledge that if they are \nmanufacturing a product that affects human life, if they are proven to \nbe negligent and they kill somebody, they are going to pay damages. And \nif they knew that they were likely to kill somebody, they are going to \npay a lot of damages.\n  I do not know that any of this legislation addresses that problem \nexcept to put some caps on the amount of damages. I do not know a way \nin a free judicial system other than the way we have where we let \njuries decide these things under the supervision of a judge, under the \nsupervision of the court of appeals, under the supervision of the State \nsupreme court. I do not know that anybody has come up with a solution \nthat is perfect that will make sure the right number of products come \nto market and no good products are restrained but bad products are kept \noff the market. The U.S. Congress cannot solve that problem. What we \ncan have is a fair, open, responsible, judicial system with fair rules \nfor everybody across the board.\n  Texas has lost how many jobs; how many thousands of jobs because of \nits product liability? I do not know where you get these figures. But \nmy suggestion is that Texas changes law. As a matter of fact, from what \nI read in the paper, Texas has made and is in the process of making \nsubstantial changes in its tort law as we speak. Do we need to do that \nfor Texas? Do we know more about what Texas needs than Texas does?\n  The Senator from Utah a while ago pointed out that only 5 percent of \nthe tort cases are filed in Federal court. That is not the product \nliability cases which is the major thrust of the underlying bill and my \namendment. But that proves their point, does it not? Most tort cases do \nnot belong in Federal court because you do not have diversity. But 35 \npercent of product liability cases are in Federal court because you do \nhave diversity, and you are more properly in an area that we can \nlegislate in.\n  So, Mr. President, I would conclude simply by saying let us refocus \non what this is about. The basic question is do we have a problem? How \nbad is it? And what do we do about it? I suggest that we do have some \nproblem. It is certainly not in the dimension of the world coming to an \nend that we have heard on the Senate floor.\n  For anybody who knows anything about the system, looks at any of the \nstatistics, it is just not there. But let us address the problem that \nwe do have. Let us do it in a responsible manner, and let us not lose \nour philosophical integrity, those of us who have campaigned on the \nbasis of limited Federal Government, having States do more in the areas \nof welfare, having States do more in the areas that affect the people \nwho elected the members of the State legislatures who write those laws, \nand have Federal Government do a lot less. I suggest that having these \nreforms in this area involving interstate commerce, with regard to \nlitigants who are involved in interstate commerce is a reasonable \napproach to a problem that will allow us to see whether or not it \nworks, how it works, perhaps will wind up in uniformity if States \ndesire to go in that direction, but does not represent a wholesale \ntakeover of 200 years of State tort law in this country.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. McCONNELL addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I would like to speak to another \namendment that will be offered by the occupant of the chair at some \ntime in the next 30 minutes or so dealing with the question of joint \nand several liability.\n  Put another way, Mr. President, we all know what that means. That is \nthe looking-for-somebody-with-a-deep-pocket problem which is a \npervasive problem in American litigation.\n  Interestingly enough, the mayor of the city of New York was before a \nsubcommittee of the judiciary yesterday, and I obtained a copy of his \ntestimony. It is really quite interesting. The mayor outlined the \nproblems of the city of New York in recent years with regard to our \ntort system, which has clearly run amok. It is very interesting that \nlast year New York City paid out $262 million in tort cases on roughly \n8,000 claims which either proceeded to settlement or verdict.\n  And the mayor goes back and compares that to earlier years. In 1977, \nthe mayor pointed out, the city paid out $24 million as compared to \n$262 million last year. In 1984, the city paid $84 million compared to \n$262 million last year. In 1990, the city of New York paid out $177 \nmillion--that was just 5 years ago--compared to $262 million in tort \ncases last year.\n  Most of these, of course, Mr. President, are cases where the \nplaintiff was trying to get into the pockets of the \n[[Page S6067]] taxpayers of the city of New York. The mayor in his \ntestimony proceeded to describe it in another way that kind of brings \nit home for all of us.\n  There has been a lot of talk here about whether statistics do or do \nnot exist in various areas of this debate. The mayor put it this way. \nHe said--and this was just yesterday before a Senate Judiciary \nCommittee subcommittee. ``With just half of our annual tort payments,'' \nsaid Mayor Giuliani, ``the city could hire 2,900 additional police \nofficers or firefighters or more than 3,700 teachers.'' The city could \nhave hired 2,900 additional police officers or firefighters or more \nthan 3,700 teachers for the money they paid out in tort claims in the \ncity of New York last year alone.\n  The mayor went on. He said, ``In terms of our operating budget, the \namount we spent on these cases is more than 61 of 75 agencies of city \ngovernment spent over a year.''\n  Let us go over that. They spent more in tort cases in the city of New \nYork than 61 of 75 agencies of the city of New York spent last year and \nmore than the combined amount budgeted to sustain the operation of the \nDA's, district attorneys, in all five boroughs of the city of New York. \nThey spent more money in tort claims last year in the city of New York \nthan the amount of the district attorneys' budgets of all five boroughs \nof the city last year.\n  The mayor proceeded to say that New York City's personal injury \npayout is an enormous expense no matter how you look at it and falls \nsquarely on the taxpayers, he says, the consumers in the city of New \nYork.\n  The mayor went on. It is kind of interesting the way he put it. He \nsays, ``As individuals, Americans are the most generous people in the \nworld. They are equally generous with their hard-earned tax dollars, \nbut they would like to know that their money is being put to use \nwisely. When they learn, however, their money is being wasted, \nAmericans rightly demand an accounting. I submit the time has come,'' \nsaid the mayor of New York, ``for an accounting of the waste associated \nwith the tort system as we know it.''\n  What he was talking about, Mr. President, is the deep-pocket issue. \n``Municipalities and other public entities are often viewed as deep \npockets that can easily afford to pay extra sums to plaintiffs claiming \nto be injured.'' He also mentioned a few of those cases.\n  I thought I might relate to the Senate the mayor of New York \nyesterday mentioned one case in which a subway mugger was caught in the \nact and shot by an alert transit cop. What did the robber do? Why, he \nsued the city and he won $4.3 million. The robber sued the city.\n  Here is another interesting one that New York experienced. He said in \nanother case an 18-year-old student in direct contravention--direct \ncontravention--of a teacher's instructions jumped over a volleyball \nnet. The teacher said, ``Don't do it.'' And the 18-year-old student did \nit anyway. The student suffered tragic injuries. But the city's \nliability for the teacher's effort to supervise cost the city $15 \nmillion.\n  The mayor cited another case. The city was ordered by a jury to pay a \nwoman's estate $1 million after she entered a closed city park, ignored \nall the instructions, entered a closed city park and drowned in 3 feet \nof water.\n  So there you have it, Mr. President. That is the kind of thing that \nis going on all across America under the concept of joint and several \nliability, and it is clearly costing taxpayers, consumers, a lot of \nmoney.\n  The Senator from Michigan on behalf of himself and myself will bring \nup shortly with the permission of the Senate the Abraham-McConnell \njoint and several liability amendment which would permit an injured \nplaintiff to collect a full judgment from any defendant found to be \nliable for any part of the injury.\n  Mr. President, the doctrine of joint liability permits an injured \nplaintiff to collect the full judgment from any defendant found liable \nfor any part of the injury. It means that no matter how remotely \nconnected a defendant is to the events leading to plaintiff's injury, a \ndefendant could be required to satisfy the entire judgment.\n  That is the kind of thing I was seeking to illustrate in referring to \nthe testimony of the mayor of New York just yesterday.\n  The result is that lawyers for the plaintiffs add a whole host of \ndefendants to a lawsuit in an effort to ensure the plaintiff can get \nthe full judgment paid. With joint liability, it does not matter if you \nhad anything to do with the events leading up to the plaintiff's \ninjury. Instead, the chances of your getting sued depend upon how deep \nyour pockets are. The deeper the pocket, the more likely to be sued.\n  For example, if a drunk driver injures an individual on someone \nelse's property, the property owner will be joined in the lawsuit. It \nhappened to the Cincinnati Symphony Orchestra, only it was not even the \nproperty owner. The accident happened near one of the orchestra's \nperformance facilities. And the orchestra, a nonprofit entity, was \nneedless dragged into a $13 million lawsuit and put at risk for the \njudgment.\n  Nonprofit organizations, municipalities, and small businesses can be \nhardest hit by joint liability. Although we do not think of these \ndefendants as wealthy or rich, they are usually adequately insured, \nwhich also makes them good candidates to be deep pockets. New York \nCity, to which I just referred, spends more on personal injury awards \nand settlements--$262 million in the last fiscal year--than it spends \non funding public libraries.\n  One industry that is severely impacted by joint liability is the \nengineering profession. Often engineering firms are small and \nentrepreneurial. The American Consulting Engineers Council reports that \nof its 1,000 members, more than 700 are involved in lawsuits. The \ntypical case involves a drunk or reckless driver speeding down a road \nthat is undergoing construction. Although the road is well marked with \na detour sign, an accident occurs. The driver sues everybody involved \nwith the road: the local government, the highway department, anybody \nwho owns adjoining property and, of course, the engineers who designed \nthe road improvement. While the engineers--and any of the other \ndefendants--may ultimately prevail, the costs of defense can be \nstaggering. The Consulting Engineers report that in 1993, they paid out \nmore than $35 million in awards and settlements. That is a huge amount \nof money, especially considering 80 percent of the engineering firms \nemploy fewer than 30 people.\n  What does it mean for consumers and taxpayers? Higher prices and more \ntaxes, since the engineering firms will have to pass their costs on to \ntheir customer. The local governments who hire engineers to build their \nroads and bridges will pay more and the American people will pay higher \ntaxes to cover these lawsuits.\n  So, make no mistake about it. The tort tax is real. Every American \nlives with it. And every potential defendant has to take account, in \nthe prices they set, for the possibility of being dragged into a \nlawsuit.\n  I recently received a letter from the institute for the National \nBlack Business Council, an association of minority business owners. Mr. \nLou Collier, the president of the council, writes in support of \nexpanding the product liability bill.\n  Without an expansion of the joint and several liability reform, Mr. \nCollier states, ``Millions of small businesses--restaurants, gas \nstation owners, hair stylists, nearly every small business you can \nthink of, would still face the threat of bankruptcy. That includes most \nAfrican-American firms.'' The latest census data shows that 49 percent \nof all black-owned firms are service firms, and Mr. Collier, on behalf \nof minority small business owners, asks us to improve the climate for \nsmall business, ``Small business owners and entrepreneurs have to \novercome staggering odds to build a successful company. They shouldn't \nhave to face a legal system where one frivolous lawsuit can force them \nto close their doors.''\n  Now, that is Mr. Collier on behalf of the minority businesses of this \ncountry.\n  The amendment offered by Senator Abraham and myself, by eliminating \njoint liability for noneconomic damages, would relieve some of those \nburdens.\n  Injured plaintiffs would still recover their full economic loss. But \nfor the \n[[Page S6068]] subjective noneconomic loss, each defendant would be \nresponsible only for his or her proportionate share of harm caused.\n  This amendment is fair and consistent with principles of individual \nresponsibility. It will put an end to the gamble taken by the trial bar \nwhen they join everyone in sight of an injury.\n  Let me just say in conclusion, Mr. President, having chaired a number \nof hearings years ago as chairman of the Courts Subcommittee of the \nJudiciary Committee, I had a hard time ever getting any plaintiff's \nlawyer to make a good argument in support of joint and several \nliability, because it is obviously not just. It violates any standard \nof American justice to require that someone who contributed little or \nnothing, just a little bit of what may have caused the harm, to end up \ngetting assessed 100 percent of the damages simply because they are \nable to pay. That is not just. That does not have anything to do with \ncivil justice.\n  It is astonishing to me, Mr. President, that our tort system in this \ncountry has evolved to the point where essentially innocent parties can \nend up being assessed all of the damages for a harm that they did not \ncause.\n  That is what the Abraham-McConnell amendment will be about when it is \nsubsequently offered. I hope that I will be able to come back to the \nfloor and speak again on this amendment at the appropriate time.\n  I wish to commend the occupant of the chair, the Senator from \nMichigan, for his great leadership in this tort reform field. He has \nbeen in the Senate now about 4 months, and I cannot remember anybody \nwho has taken a subject and made a difference on it any more quickly \nthan he has. I have enjoyed working with him.\n  We have another issue that we may be talking about later in the \ndebate, something called an early offer mechanism, which I do not have \nthe time to address at this point.\n  I just want to say how much I have enjoyed working with him. We are \ngreatly in hope that the Senate will decide that changing the way we \nhandle joint and several liability will be in the best interest of the \nAmerican people.\n  Mr. President, I believe no one is about so speak. I suggest the \nabsence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. MURRAY.

SEVERAL LIABILITY FOR NONECONOMIC DAMAGES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Congress finds that--\n       (1) because of the joint and several liability doctrine, \n     municipalities, volunteer groups, nonprofit entities, \n     property owners, and large and small businesses are often \n     brought into litigation despite the fact that their conduct \n     often had little or nothing to do with the harm suffered by \n     the claimant;\n       (2) the imposition of joint and several liability for \n     noneconomic damages frequently results in the assessment of \n     unfair and disproportionate damages against defendants that \n     bear no relationship to their fault or responsibility;\n       (3) producers of products and services who are only \n     marginally responsible for an injury risk bearing the entire \n     cost of a judgment for noneconomic damages even if the \n     products or services originate in States that have replaced \n     joint liability for noneconomic damages with proportionate \n     liability, because claimants have an incentive to bring suit \n     in States that have retained joint liability; and\n       (4) the unfair allocation of noneconomic damages under the \n     joint and several liability doctrine disrupts, impairs and \n     burdens commerce, imposing unreasonable and unjustified costs \n     on consumers, taxpayers governmental entities, large and \n     small businesses, volunteer organizations, and non-profit \n     entities.\n       (b) General Rule.--Notwithstanding any other section of \n     this Act, in any civil action whose subject matter affects \n     commerce brought in Federal or State court on any theory, the \n     liability of each defendant for noneconomic damages shall be \n     several only and shall not be joint.\n       (c) Amount of Liability.--\n       (1) In general.--Each defendant shall be liable only for \n     the amount of noneconomic damages allocated to the defendant \n     in direct proportion to the percentage of responsibility of \n     the defendant (determined in accordance with paragraph (2)) \n     for the harm to the claimant with respect to which the \n     defendant is liable. The court shall render a separate \n     judgment against each defendant in an amount determined \n     pursuant to the preceding sentence.\n       (2) Percentage of responsibility.--For purposes of \n     determining the amount of noneconomic damages allocated to a \n     defendant under this section, the trier of fact shall \n     determine the percentage of responsibility of each person, \n     including the claimant, responsible for the claimant's harm, \n     whether or not such person is a party to the action.\n       (d) Applicability.--Nothing in this section shall be \n     construed to--\n       (1) waive or affect any defense of sovereign immunity \n     asserted by the United States, or by any State, under any \n     law;\n       (2) give rise to any claim for joint liability;\n       (3) supersede or alter any Federal law;\n       [[Page S6069]] (4) preempt, supersede, or alter any State \n     law to the extent that such law would further limit the \n     applicability of joint liability to any kind of damages;\n       (5) affect the applicability of any provision of chapter 97 \n     of title 28, United States Code;\n       (6) preempt State choice-of-law rules with respect to \n     claims brought by a foreign nation or of a citizen of a \n     foreign nation; or\n       (7) affect the right of any court to transfer venue or to \n     apply the law of a foreign nation or to dismiss a claim of a \n     foreign nation or of a citizen of a foreign nation on the \n     ground of inconvenient forum.\n       (e) Federal Court Jurisdiction Not Established.--Nothing in \n     this section shall be construed to establish any jurisdiction \n     in the district courts of the United States on the basis of \n     section 1331 or 1337 of title 28, United States Code.\n       (f) Definitions.--For purposes of this section:\n       (1) The term ``claimant'' means any person who brings a \n     civil action and any person on whose behalf such an action is \n     brought. If such action is brought through or on behalf of an \n     estate, the term includes the decedent. If such action is \n     brought through or on behalf of a minor or incompetent, the \n     term includes the legal guardian of the minor or incompetent.\n       (2) The term ``commerce'' means commerce between or among \n     the several States, or with foreign nations.\n       (3)(A) The term ``economic damages'' means any objectively \n     verifiable monetary losses resulting from the harm suffered, \n     including past and future medical expenses, loss of past and \n     future earnings, burial costs, costs of repair or \n     replacement, costs of obtaining replacement services in the \n     home (including, without limitation, child care, \n     transportation, food preparation, and household care), costs \n     of making reasonable accommodations to a personal residence, \n     loss of employment, and loss of business or employment \n     opportunities, to the extent recovery for such losses is \n     allowed under applicable State law.\n       (B) The term ``economic damages'' shall not include \n     noneconomic damages.\n       (4) The term ``harm'' means any legally cognizable wrong or \n     injury for which damages may be imposed.\n       (5)(A) The term ``noneconomic damages'' means subjective, \n     nonmonetary loss resulting from harm, including pain, \n     suffering, inconvenience, mental suffering, emotional \n     distress, loss of society and companionship, loss of \n     consortium, injury to reputation, and humiliation.\n       (B) The term ``noneconomic damages'' shall not include \n     economic damages or punitive damages.\n       (6) The term ``punitive damages'' means damages awarded \n     against any person or entity to punish such persons or entity \n     or to deter such person or entity, or others, from engaging \n     in similar behavior in the future.\n       (7) The term ``State'' means any State of the United \n     States, the District of Columbia, the Commonwealth of Puerto \n     Rico, the Northern Mariana Islands, the Virgin Islands, Guam, \n     American Samoa, and any other territory or possession of the \n     United States, or any political subdivision of any of the \n     foregoing.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, the amendment I have proposed with my \nesteemed colleague from Kentucky would extend the joint liability \nreforms of S. 565 to all cases whose subject matter affects interstate \ncommerce. This extension is necessary, in our view, to realize the \nbasic goals of the bill.\n  In its traditional form, the doctrine of joint liability allows the \nplaintiff to collect the entire amount of a judgment from any defendant \nfound to be at least partially responsible for the plaintiff's damages.\n  Thus, for example, a defendant found to be 1 percent responsible for \nthe plaintiff's damages could be forced to pay 100 percent of the \nplaintiff's judgment.\n  This example is not merely theoretical. In the case of Walt Disney \nWorld versus Wood, the plaintiff sought recovery of damages resulting \nfrom a collision between her go-kart and another driven by her fiancee. \nThe jury found the plaintiff 14 percent responsible, and her fiancee 85 \npercent responsible, for the plaintiff's damages. Thus, between them, \nthe plaintiff and her fiancee were 99 percent responsible for her \ndamages.\n  Unfortunately for Disney, however, the jury found it 1 percent \nresponsible for the plaintiff's damages and, under the doctrine of \njoint liability, Disney was forced to pay 86 percent of the plaintiff's \njudgment.\n  The Disney case underscores the fact that unreformed joint liability \nforces defendants to pay judgments on the basis of their resources, not \ntheir responsibility. Thus, a largely blameless defendant can be \npunished for the actions of a truly culpable defendant simply because \nthe former defendant has greater assets than the latter.\n  This unfairness is aggravated when noneconomic damages are awarded.\n  Noneconomic damages are awarded to compensate plaintiffs for \nsubjective harm, like pain and suffering, emotional distress, and \nhumiliation. Since noneconomic damages are not based on tangible \nlosses, however, there are no objective criteria for calculating their \namount. As a result, the size of these awards often depends more on the \nluck of the draw, in terms of the jury, than on the rule of law.\n  Thus, when defendants are held jointly liable for noneconomic \ndamages--as they are under the unreformed version of joint liability--\nthey can be forced to pay enormous sums for unverifiable damages they \ndid not cause.\n  Apparently forgotten amid all this is the old idea that the law is \nsupposed to yield predictable, fair, and equitable results.\n  In cases where the doctrine of joint liability is applied, then, we \ndepart from the fundamental concept, rooted in simple justice, that \ntort law liability should be based on fault. This departure yields a \nnumber of undesirable consequences.\n  First, determining liability on a basis other than fault often leaves \npeople with an overwhelming sense of helplessness. No matter how \ncareful they might be, actors are no longer masters of their own fate \nwith regard to the extent of their exposure to liability.\n  For example, one of my cousins operates a baseball batting cage. \nPatrons of the cage pay money to swing at pitches hurled by a pitching \nmachine. Obviously, a fast-pitched baseball can cause injury, so the \nsmall business posted warnings that the cage should only be used by \nexperienced batters, and that only one person should be in the batter's \nbox at a time. On one occasion, however, two patrons squeezed into the \nbatter's box, including one who had never hit a fast-pitched baseball \nbefore. The inexperienced batter was struck by the ball and injured. \nThe business was sued for this injury, although the plaintiff and her \naccomplice were largely responsible for it.\n  Thus, because of joint liability, and despite their best efforts to \nact responsibly, my cousin's business faced the prospect of paying for \nall the plaintiff's damages.\n  A second and related point is that basing liability on criteria other \nthan fault erodes incentives for responsible behavior.\n  As Karyn Hicks has explained in a leading law review article,\n\n       [u]nder joint and several liability, whether the actor is 1 \n     percent responsible or 100 percent responsible for an injury, \n     his actual cost potential for involvement in the activity \n     will always be the same. He will, therefore, have little \n     incentive to expend his resources in accident avoidance \n     behavior, such as equipment maintenance or taking the time to \n     act carefully, if * * * he will still have to pay the same as \n     he would if he had made no expenditure to avoid the accident \n     in the first place.\n\n  Thus, by reducing or eliminating an actor's reward for acting \ncarefully, we likewise reduce or eliminate the incentive for \nshouldering the extra costs associated with careful conduct. The \nresult, of course, is more accidents and injuries.\n  In truth, Mr. President, to the extent that joint liability requires \nparties to provide compensation for harms they did not cause, it acts \nlike an accident insurance system. But this system is remarkably \ninefficient. Less than half of every dollar paid out in damage awards \ngoes to the injured party--the remainder goes to court costs and \nattorney fees.\n  Of course, the costs imposed on defendants by unreformed joint \nliability are not limited to damage awards. In case after case, deep \npockets organizations and individuals are made defendants for no reason \nother than their financial resources. For example, George McGovern \noperated a country inn that was sued by a man who got into a fistfight \nin its parking lot.\n  Mr. McGovern had a security man on duty at the time, and he managed \nto win the case. But he only did so after, in his words, ``the \nexpenditure of a great deal of time, effort and money.''\n  In another case, a McDonald's restaurant was sued by a driver whose \ncar was struck by a car driven by a drive-in patron of the restaurant.\n  The plaintiff argued that McDonald's had been negligent by failing to \nwarn its patron of the dangers of eating while driving. The case was a \npatent \n[[Page S6070]] attempt to extort a settlement from McDonald's by means \nof the threat of joint liability, but McDonald's prevailed only after 3 \nyears of costly litigation.\n  Although not reflected in any damage award, the costs of these two \ncases should be attributed to the lure of joint liability because, \nabsent that doctrine, the cases almost certainly would not have been \nbrought.\n  Now, some may ask why we should reform a doctrine that has been \naround as long as joint liability. That is a fair question, but it has \na ready answer.\n  Joint liability was designed for a fundamentally different body of \nlaw than that in place today. As Ms. Hicks explains, ``the evolution of \njoint liability took place at a time when the contributory negligence \nof the plaintiff was a complete defense to any negligence action.'' But \nthe vast majority of States have now abolished contributory negligence \nas a complete defense.\n  By failing to reform joint liability as well, we have moved, as Ms. \nHicks explains, ``from a situation where a wrongdoer compensated an \ninnocent victim to one in which an actor responsible to a degree as \nminute as one percent * * * may, in fact, be confronted with paying the \nentire damage costs to a plaintiff who may have been considerably more \nresponsible and in a far better position of cost avoidance than was \nhe.'' Thus, Mr. President, joint liability reform is necessary to bring \nthe doctrine into alignment with the reforms made to related, \nbackground principles of law.\n  S. 565 would reform joint liability in the product liability context \nby allowing it to be imposed for economic damages only, so that a \ndefendant could be forced to pay for only his proportionate share of \nnoneconomic damages. As a result, plaintiffs would be fully compensated \nfor their out-of-pocket losses, while defendants would be better able \nto predict and verify the amount of damages they would be forced to \npay. This reform thus would address the most pressing concerns of \nplaintiffs and defendants alike.\n  But this reform needs to be extended beyond the product liability \ncontext, because entities other than manufacturers and sellers are \namong those hardest hit by unreformed joint liability.\n  The impact of our current system on nonprofits and local governments, \nfor example, is well-documented: Individual Little League Baseball \nleagues have seen their liability insurance premiums soar 1,000 percent \nover the past 5 years alone; the city of New York now pays out almost \n$270 million in tort awards each year, which is double the amount of \nfunding for city libraries; and well-grounded fears of liability thwart \nthe recruitment efforts of volunteer organizations.\n  Extending this bill's joint liability reforms beyond the product \nliability context is also critical to the bill's goals of enhancing \neconomic growth and competitiveness.\n  Small businesses are the engine of that growth, generating 2 of every \n3 new net jobs in our economy since the early 1970's. To a significant \nextent, however, small businesses are forced to direct their resources \nnot to job creation, but to costs associated with lawsuits.\n  Liability insurance premiums paid by American businesses, for \nexample, are now 20 to 50 times higher than those paid by foreign \nfirms.\n  But the bill as currently written fails to pare these costs \nadequately because many if not most of the lawsuits involving small \nbusinesses do not concern product liability.\n  Instead, small businesses are routinely ensnared in suits for slip \nand fall, misconduct by employees, patrons, and the like. Since a \nmajority of small business owners take home less than $50,000 per year \na determination of joint liability in even one such lawsuit can cripple \na small business or force it to close its doors. To be serious about \nenhancing economic growth, we have to address that threat.\n  Mr. President, it is clear that the American people, men and women \nalike, demand joint liability reform. According to a recent poll \nconducted by the Luntz Research Co., 71 percent of Americans believe \nthat joint liability reforms should be extended to all lawsuits, not \njust product liability cases.\n  In summary, Mr. President, we can no longer afford to overlook the \nheavy burden that unreformed joint liability imposes on our society. I \nsay our society, rather than simply ``defendants,'' because we all know \nthat the costs of our current system are passed on to all of society, \nrich and poor alike, in the form of lost jobs, higher taxes, reduced \ncommunity services, and rising prices. Without our amendment, we can \naddress only a small fraction of those costs. With it, we can make a \ndifference in the lives of all Americans.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, this is merely in the nature of an \nannouncement to confirm what I had said earlier. At approximately 5:45 \nI will ask for regular order at the direction of the majority leader \nand move to table the Thompson amendment. And I am certain there will \nbe a rollcall on that motion.\n  So I would urge Members who wish to speak to the Thompson amendment, \nor for that matter the Abraham and McConnell amendment, to do so. The \nmajority leader is working with the Democratic leader with respect to \nwhat will happen after that time and for tomorrow. But for the \nattention of all Members, at approximately 5:45 there will be a vote on \nthe Thompson amendment.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HEFLIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HEFLIN. Mr. President, I have just read a copy of the Abraham-\nMcConnell-Kyl amendment. I would like to discuss some of the language \nthat I find in here.\n  Basically it says: Notwithstanding any other section of this act, in \nany civil action whose subject matter affects commerce brought in a \nFederal or a State court on any theory that liability of each defendant \nfor economic damages shall be several only and shall not be joined.\n  So this is a much broadening of the issue than what was in the \nunderlying product liability bill. It says in any civil action whose \nsubject matter affects commerce--it does not say ``interstate \ncommerce,'' it says ``commerce''--brought under any theory. I want to \ninclude that in my discussions with Senator Thompson on what is a civil \naction. We concluded that any action which is not a criminal action is \na civil action.\n  This in effect preempts State law. State laws have many aspects that \naffect noneconomic damages. Noneconomic damages are defined herein as \nmeaning subjective nonmonetary damages resulting from harm, including \npain, suffering, inconvenience, mental suffering, emotional distress, \nloss of society companionship, loss of consortium, injury to \nreputation, and humiliation. That would mean, for example, that all \nsuits that we might be talking about that are nonmonetary, including \nlibel, defamation, slander, etc.\n  If there is one or more publication by a writer or contributing \nwriter, all of those, then under this amendment you would have to pick \nthe percentage of harm or the percentage of fault on each defendant. It \nwould also mean that in the punitive damages in calculating the Snowe \namendment, which is now a part of the underlying bill, you would have \nto consider this. And you would have to pick out each defendant. There \nis also the provision that does not allow for you to introduce any \nevidence of punitive damage or wrongdoing in a case at chief.\n  So I gave the illustration this morning of the truck company that \nknows that the driver has had four drunk driving charges, two reckless \ndriving charges, and, therefore, you could not \n[[Page S6071]] prove that evidence because that would be punitive as to \nthe driver and as to the owner of the trucking company, and all that \nmight be the owner of the trucking company, in calculating the damages. \nYou would not be able to do it. It might well be that they say, ``Well, \nthe truck owner has just 5 percent of the damage,'' because the jury \ndid not know anything about the fact that he had knowledge of those \nfour convictions, and, therefore, it can affect it in a lot of \ndifferent ways.\n  But I want to get also into what this includes. I just read it. I \nhave not had time to do adequate research. But I do have questions, and \nI think they ought to be answered. Does this include noneconomic \ndamages such as pain and suffering, or the emotional distress that \ncould occur to an American with a disability or a State law that has \ncertain disability acts? Does this apply to those States that have laws \nagainst sexual harassment? Sexual harassment is not a type of injury \nthat you show in economic terms. It is a subjective damage that you \nhave to evaluate. The discrimination cases that come up in employment, \nsometimes you may be able to prove monetary damages on that. But there \nare other elements of emotional distress, pain and suffering, and \nhumiliation.\n  Then I also wonder what about antitrust litigation under a State law? \nThere are so many unanswered questions about how this would apply. You \nwonder to what extent it would go. This amendment particularly seems to \nbe, as it was under the product liability underlying bill, directed \ntoward the non-wage earner, the retired person, the elderly who are \ngoing to spend, hopefully, their days in their retirement, their sunset \nyears in life with emotional peace and enjoyment.\n And yet they are deprived of that, and you have someone over here that \nyou cannot even prove the gross negligence or the recklessness or the \nwanton conduct in a trial in chief in trying to calculate whatever the \nnoneconomic damages might be.\n\n  The woman who is deprived of the right to bear children comes under \nnoneconomic damages--whether or not it occurs from a product or whether \nit would occur from the automobile accident or any type of cause of \naction that might arise pertaining to this amendment.\n  This is a very broad, sweeping amendment that covers so many aspects \nof the tort laws of the States, and we have had, I suppose, no hearings \non this, as far as I know. I do not know whether this amendment was \never the subject of a hearing beyond the scope of the underlying \nproduct liability bill. I would like to ask the distinguished chairman \nof the Commerce Committee, were there any hearings ever held outside of \nproduct liability as to the effect of eliminating joint and several \nliability for noneconomic damages for all civil actions?\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. On behalf of the distinguished chairman of the Commerce \nCommittee, Senator Pressler, the answer is no.\n  Mr. HEFLIN. I still refer to the Senator as my chairman, but I \nrealize that all of a sudden we have had change.\n  So no hearings have been held in regards to the sweep of this. I \nwould like to also ask the ranking member, have any hearings been held \nas to the broad sweep and the encompassing aspects of all civil actions \npertaining to punitive damages outside of the field of product \nliability?\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. No. What is particularly disturbing, in the accelerated \nhearings--I say accelerated--actual markup took place, when and even \nbefore, unbeknownst, I would say, to most members of the committee they \nadded on the matter of rental cars, they added on the matter of \ncomponent parts, and a lot of other things. And it has been like a \nsheep dog with the taste of blood, gobble up anything. Anything you can \nthink of, put it on. We have had no hearings on any of this.\n  Mr. HEFLIN. In other words, we have an expansion to all civil actions \non any theory as to changes in the area of punitive damages and the \nelimination of joint and several liability. And the amendment does not \nlimit its application to interstate commerce. We as a deliberate body, \nthe U.S. Senate, are going to attach our stamp of approval to language \nthat has such a far-reaching, encompassing aspect without having a \nsingle witness or law professor or defense lawyer, or anybody to advise \nus as to its potential effect.\n  I do not know where and how it affects Americans under the \nDisabilities Act or a State law that has a disability act. I do not \nknow how it affects--and from this one cannot tell--what it does \npertaining to all of the various State laws dealing with the \nenvironment. There are some States that have had Superfund-type cleanup \nlaws. What happens where there are numerous parties which might have \ncontaminated the environment?\n  It certainly seems to me that these things ought to be subject to \nsome hearings and some investigations rather than coming here without \nhaving really any great knowledge as to its ultimate impact.\n  Now, it seems to me that this matter of rendering a separate judgment \nagainst each defendant as to the amount to be determined, pursuant to \nthe preceding sentence, which is that they be in direct proportion to \nthe percentage of responsibility of the defendant.\n  Now, in a trial of a case where you might have 10, 15, or more \ndefendants, there are really no standards, no real directions that are \ngiven as to how you, in effect, will determine the placing of damages, \nno real instructions or standards, or various criteria to be used.\n  There are just so many unanswered questions, it seems to me that the \nSenate ought to give certainly a lot of careful thought to this \namendment before we move forward.\n  The overall concept in the past has been that the wrongdoers, if a \njudgment is obtained, do the apportionment of the damages amongst \nthemselves. Some States have what they call contribution among joint \ntort feasors. This has not been a real problem that I have heard of any \ngreat consequence--and I practiced law for 25 years--where there were \nthose who really suffered as a result of joint tort feasor action. \nThere may be some illustrations and there may be some instances to be \npointed out, but I think they would be rare, indeed. Of course, if a \nperson does not have any money, and the person who is injured only has \na judgment against somebody that does not have any money, he cannot \ncollect. The injured party is left holding the bag. He is the one who \nis really suffering. In other words, what you are doing with this \namendment is benefiting the wrongdoer.\n  Now, under the underlying bill, you also have this matter of \ndetermining the percentage of fault. You have the situation of the \nemployer's responsibility, co-employee's responsibility, and in the \nunderlying bill, which is designed and it seems to be for such an \nadvantage, that the harm can be placed against a nonparty. He does not \nhave to be a defendant. You come up with somebody. And there are a lot \nof people you cannot sue. They are in bankruptcy, and so therefore, if \nthey are in bankruptcy they have no money. Everybody wants to put all \nthe fault off on him, on the person that might be in bankruptcy. \nSometimes you cannot get service on someone in order to file a suit. So \nthere are all sorts of considerations that should given to the impact \nof this far reaching amendment.\n  This underlying bill, seemingly, in determining the fault of the \nemployer and the co-employee, is designed to give a particular emphasis \nto that. And it has language in the bill which says the last issue that \nshall be presented to the jury is the issue of the amount of fault that \nfalls on the co-employee or the employer.\n  So you, therefore, try to have that fresh in the minds of the jury \nrather than somebody being able to present the case in a manner which \nthey consider to be the proper way to do it. It ends up that you are \nrequired to try to emphasize and put the emphasis on the employer's \nfault, the coemployee's fault. And in most States you cannot sue the \ncoemployee, who cannot be a party to the lawsuit because the employer \nis protected by workmen's compensation and the coemployee is protected \nby workmen's compensation.\n  So, all of these things are involved in this amendment which to me \nraises many questions. It just seems to me that it is already faulted \nwith the fact that we have got that in the underlying \n[[Page S6072]] bill. But to add it to all civil actions under any \ntheory is grossly, in my judgment, unfair.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Snowe). The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Thank you, Madam President.\n  I would like to try to answer several of the questions that were \nraised by the distinguished Senator from Alabama in his comments a \nmoment ago. I was out of the Chamber for a minute, so I am trying to \nrecapitulate all of his remarks. But I will go to the ones I think I \nunderstand.\n  One question that has been raised is the issue of whether the Senate \nhas had an opportunity to consider some of the arguments that are \ninvolved in this effort to expand the underlying bill, the substitute \nbill, through such things as hearings and so on.\n  I would just say that I think there have been several efforts to do \nthat. It is my understanding that in the Commerce Committee the notion \nof broadening legislation in that regard was discussed at least by one \nof the witnesses. A Mr. Ted Olson discussed the notion of broadening.\n  Also, obviously the principles of changing from the joint and several \nsystem that has preexisted were discussed in the context of the \nunderlying bill itself. We discussed to some degree the same issues in \na hearing that was held in the Judiciary Committee on punitive damages \nas well as in a subcommittee hearing that was conducted yesterday by \nSenator Grassley on the cost of the legal system. To my knowledge, \nthose are at least several venues in which these discussions have been \nthe subject of hearings.\n  In addition, I guess I would just point out to the Chair that these \nare certainly not new issues. I believe the notion of reforming the \nlegal system has been, as I understand it, at least before the Senate \non previous occasions in various committees. So I think that we have \nhad previous discussions as well.\n  Another point I want to address is the question that was raised as to \nwhether the amendment we are proposing would apply to such things as \nthe Civil Rights Act and so on. This amendment expressly does not alter \nor supersede Federal law. So in the case of any Federal law, whether it \nis the Civil Rights Act or others, I guess, that were referenced, I was \nout of the Chamber at that time, where provision for joint and several \nliability is provided, this amendment would not supersede. Those \nprovisions would remain in place.\n  Let me just comment a little more broadly on some of the other points \nthat were touched on by the Senator from Alabama in his remarks.\n  As far as noneconomic damages go, he, I think, did a very good job of \noutlining the broad definition of what constitutes noneconomic damages. \nAnd there is no intent on the part of our amendment to change that \ndefinition or to confine in any way the types of noneconomic damages \nwhich people might be able to recover.\n  The purpose of our amendment is to say that, while you may recover \nnoneconomic damages, you should only recover them from a defendant to \nthe extent the defendant is responsible for those noneconomic damages. \nAnd in the sense that so many of the noneconomic damages that were \nreferenced tend to be in areas that are very subjective in terms of \ncalculation, very hard to discern, it strikes me at least to be a \nfundamental principle of fairness that we not hold defendants who are \nnot responsible for the negligence involved for damages over which it \nis very difficult, if not impossible, to calculate. As a sense of \nfairness, I think the type of amendment we are offering is responsive.\n  I would close with one final thought. We heard, I thought, a good \npoint made with respect to some of the people who could conceivably be \nplaintiffs in actions of this sort; references to the elderly who might \nbe injured and be seeking a form of recovery and not be somehow able to \nbecause we assign damages on the basis of responsibility.\n  But it seems to me that it is equally possible that the type of \nelderly individual referenced by the Senator from Alabama could be a \ndefendant--an elderly individual who has saved his or her entire life \nfor his or her retirement, who has a certain amount of fixed assets \nunlikely to get greater because of the fact that they have stopped \nworking, who, because of joint and several liability, finds themselves, \nunhappily, the deep pocket in some type of multiple defendant situation \nand, consequently, even though they have only participated in a small \ndegree in terms of the responsibility for an injury, end up holding the \nbag for the entire amount of the injury because the other defendants, \neven though more blameworthy, are judgment proof.\n  In short, I think you can see it from both perspectives.\n  The notion of our amendment is to try to place responsibility for \nresolving noneconomic damages on the shoulders of those who are most \nresponsible for the damages in the first place, on the basis of their \napportioned share of negligence.\n  So, for those reasons, I think our amendment is a sensible expansion \nof the underlying legislation. As I said earlier, I strongly hope that \nMembers of the Senate will support it.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. HEFLIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. HEFLIN. Madam President, I was interested in what the \ndistinguished Senator from Michigan had to say, particularly with \nregard to the reversal of where he made the elderly individual the \ndefendant.\n  Most elderly persons in our country over the years, at least, I think \nthe biggest majority of them, believed in having a home and buying a \nhome and paying for their home by the time they reach retirement age. \nMost of them have what the insurance industry calls a homeowner's \npolicy.\n  Now, how does that affect the illustration that he gave of the \nelderly defendant?\n  Practically every homeowner's policy has a provision known as the \ncomprehensive liability provision. And those comprehensive liability \nprovisions which insurance companies have sold over the years are \nindeed very comprehensive. I commend the insurance industry for the way \nthey have sold these policies and their breadth. They cover pretty well \nany type of action that might be brought, unless it is specifically \nexcluded.\n  The elderly individual probably in almost every case will have \ninsurance to protect them from any liability that they might incur. \nCertainly, if they are driving an automobile, they carry insurance.\n  So I think the opportunity of saying the reversal--if you leave out \nthe element of insurance--most of them are insured relative to this \nmatter.\n  I just wanted to point that out in regard to this.\n  I have talked a lot about the Snowe amendment and severability and \nprovisions on punitive damages in the underlying bill. Since Senator \nSnowe is in the chair, it might be of interest to her, and I will \nrecite it again.\n  Under the provisions of the underlying bill, if a person brings a \nsuit and demands punitive damages, there is a provision that says if \nyou demand it, either party can demand a separate hearing for punitive \ndamages. I think that increases transaction costs, but that is not the \npoint I want to bring here.\n  In that separate hearing, there is other language in the underlying \nbill which says that a party cannot introduce evidence of the conduct \nwhich would be admissible under a punitive damage trial, but in the \nsuit for compensatory damages. So, therefore, a person who might be \nreally, under several liability involved in this, 85 percent at fault \nbut could not present the evidence of conduct which would constitute \nconduct recoverable under punitive damages in the trial in chief, you \nmight have a situation where that person is 85 percent at fault really \nbut because of this protection ends up with only about 5 percent in the \nnoneconomic damage aspect of it.\n  So when you attempt to double that, you have a problem. That language \npertaining to the fact that you cannot introduce in the compensatory \ndamages part of a trial, the conduct of a defendant who is willful or \nconscious and flagrantly indifferent, but who could come under the \npunitive damage portion of a trial, prohibits such evidence from being \nintroduced in the trial in chief. Therefore, the severability aspect of \nthis comes into play, and it can well be that the defendant who is the \n[[Page S6073]] greatest at fault and, therefore, you would have the \nseverability as it would apply to the noneconomic damages, would be, in \neffect, able to escape relative to these matters.\n  So it is something she might want to look into as this bill goes \nforward. I feel like there is a major problem that might be there. I \njust mention that again.\n  I think I will yield the floor at this time.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Madam President, I just wanted to add a couple more \npoints to my opening remarks on this amendment, because I think they \nelaborate a little more fully on some of the concerns I raised at that \ntime.\n  As I mentioned in my comments, the need, in my judgment, for \nexpanding the underlying substitute is based on my belief that there is \na need to provide the same sort of protections to nonprofit \norganizations and civic organizations, and so on, that we are trying to \nprovide to product manufacturers. I just wanted to enter into the \nRecord a couple of examples that have been brought to my attention in \nrecent days in the context of this debate.\n  The first is a case of a battered women's shelter in Evanston, IL. A \nfew years ago, the Junior League of Evanston sought to establish such a \nshelter. An exhaustive search of liability insurance coverage revealed \nthat no insurance company would provide coverage until the shelter \noperated for 3 years without being sued. No one was willing to serve on \nthe shelter board unless it had liability insurance. So the shelter was \nnever established.\n  That is the kind of, I think, unhappy outcome which the current \nsystem with respect to joint and several liability has created.\n  A similar incident involving the Cincinnati Symphony Orchestra \nilluminates the problem as well. A situation occurred recently where \ntraffic was backed up on the exit ramp leading to the Cincinnati \nSymphony Orchestra's facility prior to a recent performance. A drunk \ndriver, speeding above posted limits, rear ended a car in the traffic \njam injuring the driver of that car. The injured driver filed a lawsuit \nand made the orchestra a defendant only after learning that the drunk \ndriver was uninsured. The owner of the land on which the facility was \nsituated was also made a defendant.\n  The plaintiff argued that the orchestra and the landowner were \nnegligent in allowing the traffic jam to occur. After litigating the \ncase all the way through trial, the orchestra and landowner were found \nto be 20 percent at fault between them. However, through the \napplication of joint liability, the orchestra and the landowner were \nmade responsible for all the plaintiff's damages, even though, by any \ncommonsense measure, they had done little or nothing to cause them.\n  This is really the principle that caused me to bring this amendment \nin to expand the underlying substitute, because I think we have \ninstance after instance where these types of outcomes are produced and, \nas I said in my opening statement, they happen regardless of the extent \nto which the defendant may have tried to protect against injury. We \nknow that no situation is without its risks. Nobody who operates a \nbusiness can operate it risk free. They can and should have as much \nincentive as possible to minimize the risks that they create.\n  Under a joint/several liability approach, however, there is not as \nmuch incentive to limit risk because, as I stated in my earlier \ncomments, no matter how successfully one insulates themselves, even to \nexclude certain risks and possibilities of liability from happening, \nthey still may be found responsible and pay the entire damages involved \nin an injury simply because of joint and several liability.\n  I do not think that is the kind of incentive system we want, and I \nthink that set of incentives ought to apply across the board. \nTherefore, I believe the expansion of the legislation through my \namendment from the product area exclusively to other areas, as \nindicated in the amendment, is a sensible and wise addition to this \nbill.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Madam President, once again, we are back now to the \njoint and several question with the Abraham amendment. I remember a few \nyears ago this issue of competitiveness in Europe, for example, that \nthey did not have this and we pointed out at that particular time, and \nI read again article V of the Directive of the Official Journal of the \nEuropean Community:\n\n       Where, as a result of the provisions of this directive, two \n     or more persons are liable for the same damage, they shall be \n     liable jointly and severally, without prejudice to the \n     provisions of national law concerning the rights of \n     contribution or recourse.\n\n  So if they get on to the matter of competitiveness, I wanted to \nanswer that in the first question, because the trend for joint and \nseveral without competitors is just that. The United States gives \noverwhelmingly predominant treatment--and in fact they call it fair \ntreatment with respect to economic loss. Let us not misunderstand here. \nThey characterize in the majority report what is fair. They use that \nword--and you can use--in the majority language of the report of the \ncommittee.\n\n       Section 109 introduces fairness and uniformity to the law \n     concerning joint and several liability and product liability \n     actions by adopting the California rule, which holds that \n     defendants are responsible only for their fair share of a \n     claimant's subjective nonmonetary losses, including pain and \n     suffering awards.\n\n  Well, is that fair? It was on an initiative, Madam President--\nproposition 51. That State of California is as goofy as it can come. \nThey had, I remember, proposition 13 on property tax and wrecked the \nState. They can sell anything out there, mostly. They get a lot of \nmoney and a lot of advertising and a lot of TV and get a temper up and \neverything else like that. So they are ruining a magnificent school \nsystem. You could not get a license to build down in the capital, in \nPasadena and Sacramento. I remember many instances, from friends out \nthere, that it never has been the same since. They removed property tax \nsupport for general government and rolled it back, and now they have \ngone to an 8 percent sales tax and they have gone to a special gas tax \nfor highways and everything else, and they have been struggling ever \nsince with multibillion dollar deficits. They call it fair, the \nCalifornia rule. It is not the usual rule in the several States of \nAmerica. It is the unusual rule, in this Senator's opinion, the unfair \none.\n  Why did we say that it is unfair? We go right to the idea as to \neconomic loss. It should be joint and several. Now, that is a \nhypothesis; that is the premise of the amendment of the distinguished \nSenator from Michigan. He agrees that is sound. In fact, the majority \nof the committee agrees that is sound. In fact, the major sponsors, the \nSenators from West Virginia and Washington, the principal sponsors here \nof product liability, all agree that joint and several is sound and \nfair. But only for economic damages.\n  What they are really doing is savaging the women and family \npopulation, savaging the women and family population of our country. \nThat crowd that came to town with the family bill got a contract, and \nthey are going to build a family. The majority of women, thank heavens, \nare the builders of the family, producing the family, caring for the \nfamily, and all without a salary--noneconomic loss, all with no \ncompensation, so no compensatory situation. The family. Everybody I \nknow down in my backyard, they have the big movement, the religious \nright and everything else. But they all say, ``I am for the family, the \nfamily, the family.'' But I can tell you here and now that they are \ngutting the family.\n  Let us see what Professor Finley said with respect to the \ndistinctions between economic loss and noneconomic loss damages harming \nwomen:\n\n       Provisions that make distinctions between economic loss and \n     noneconomic loss, favoring the former and disfavoring the \n     latter, disadvantage women for several reasons. Noneconomic \n     loss damages, which include compensation for loss of \n     reproductive capacity, impairment of sexual function, harm to \n     dignity and self-esteem, and emotional or psychic harm, are \n     crucial category of damages for women, because many injuries \n     that primarily or especially affect women are compensated \n     largely, if at all, through noneconomic loss damages. For \n     example, reproductive harm, including pregnancy loss, or \n     [[Page S6074]] infertility, is compensated primarily through \n     noneconomic loss damages, because the greatest impact of \n     these sorts of injuries is not on the ability to earn a \n     paycheck, but rather on the ability to be a whole, fully \n     functional female. Sexual harassment, sexual assault, sexual \n     improprieties by health care providers are also examples of \n     injuries that have profound impacts but are compensated \n     primarily through noneconomic loss damages.\n       Noneconomic loss damages are especially crucial to women in \n     the area of drugs and medical devices. Unfortunately, far too \n     many of the modern health and product liability disasters in \n     the drug and device area involve products designed to be used \n     in women's bodies, usually in connection with reproduction or \n     sexuality: The anti-nausea drug thalidomide, which produced \n     horrifying birth defects; the ineffective anti-miscarriage \n     drug DES, which causes cervical cancer and infertility; the \n     Dalkon Shield and Copper-7 IUDs, which caused sometimes fatal \n     or sterilizing pelvic inflammatory disease and uterine \n     perforations; silicone breast implants, which can cause \n     debilitating autoimmune diseases and permanent disfigurement; \n     the acne treatment drug Accutane, which if taken during the \n     early stages of pregnancy causes serious birth defects; the \n     drug Ritodine, which is prescribed to prevent premature \n     labor, but has proven fatal to some women; the contraceptive \n     Norplant, which is turning out to have serious side effects \n     and to require expensive and dangerous invasive surgery to \n     remove. The greatest extent of injuries caused by these \n     products is to reproductive capacity, to the ability to bear \n     a whole and healthy child, to intimacy and normal sexual \n     functioning, to self esteem and dignity--all aspects of \n     injury which are compensated by noneconomic loss damages. \n     Studies also demonstrate that the prospect of liability can \n     be a factor to encourage drug companies to more adequately \n     include women in clinical trials of drugs and to perform more \n     extensive testing of drugs and devices to be used in women's \n     bodies.\n\n  If you go with this Abraham amendment, I can tell you here and now, \nyou have cut off clinical trials of women in this drug field, because \nthere is no loss there. They have written that off now as a care in \nthis society--the family crowd that has come to town wanting a family \nbill, a family tax cut, and a family this and that, and they want to \nsavage the family here with this joint and several prohibition, or \nnoneconomic damages.\n  Going further with Professor Finley--and to make it absolutely clear, \nshe is an outstanding professor. Lucinda M. Finley is her complete \nname. She says:\n\n       Noneconomic loss damages are also of particular importance \n     to women because a growing body of empirical research \n     demonstrates that women recover far less than men for \n     economic loss damages,\n      and it is primarily thanks to the noneconomic loss category \n     that women's tort recoveries move closer to the average \n     for men. Women recover less under the economic loss \n     category because on the whole they earn less than men; \n     because their household labor, while recognized, is valued \n     very low; because economic loss damages are often \n     calculated using tables that presume that women earn less \n     and will stop work earlier; and because so many injuries \n     that happen to women have low economic loss value and \n     injure primarily in noneconomic ways.\n\n  These inequities in economic loss damages are also true for other \nsocial groups that earn little or less on average than white men: The \nelderly and retired, blacks, and Hispanics. Noneconomic loss damages \ncan also make the tort recoveries of these economically less well off \nsocial groups more commensurate with what white men receive for similar \ninjuries.\n  Indeed, the nonpecuniary loss aspects of damages may be even more \ncrucial for the elderly person or for the poorly paid minority clerical \nor domestic worker, because they are less likely than high wage earners \nto have disability and health insurance, a pension plan, or investments \nthat can provide a security net in the event of catastrophic injury.\n  For all these reasons, full recognition of noneconomic loss damages \nis of fundamental importance to ensuring that the tort system provides \nadequate compensation to women for reproductive and sexual harm, and to \nthe elderly and lower paid or impoverished members of society.\n  Madam President, I think it is clear cut. I could go on. There is no \nquestion in my mind what the intent here is. Again, the manufacturers \nbill is not for consumers. We have to have Senators on the floor \nsaying, ``Oh, I am worried about the consumers.'' The manufacturers \nbill, again, limits their liability and limits their cost so they can \nmake more money and safety can decline in the United States.\n  What do we do when we provide for that several proof in noneconomic \nloss and the degree thereof? I read again from Professor Finley:\n\n       Joint liability does not mean that part of the injury was \n     caused by the independent actions of one defendant, while \n     another part of the indivisible injury was caused by another \n     defendant's actions. In many product cases, the injuries are \n     an indivisible whole, and cannot meaningfully be parceled out \n     in this way. For example, when a defective IUD causes an \n     infection that renders a woman permanently infertile, one \n     cannot meaningfully ascertain that the manufacturer's failure \n     to test the tail string caused half the infertility, while \n     the failure of the manufacturer of the copper or string \n     filament to test its effects when introduced into the uterus \n     caused the other half of the infection.\n\n  Now, here is an initiative to simplify the uniformity for less \nbureaucracy, causing what? If they want to know why there are so many \nlawyers, I can say now, having tried cases, that is going to put \nanother 2 days of trial on my case, and we will spend more time and \nthere will be more dispute and there will be more bureaucracy and there \nwill be more cost.\n  That is all in the name of, really, punishing the poor, the minority, \nthe women in our society, particularly family members. I think it ought \nto be rejected out of hand. They do not reject it. They adopt it with \nthe word ``fair'' for economic loss.\n  It is not 1 percent in economic loss who has only 1 percent \ncontributing, we will say, to the wrongful act or injury and the other \n99 percent having gone bankrupt, and I only had 1 percent contribution \nto the particular verdict and finding of that jury. Yes, if it is only \n1 percent for economic, then let the 1 percent pay the 100 percent. Let \nthe 1 percent pay the 100 percent. They adopt that with the word \n``fair.'' They think that is fair, joint and several, for that. That is \nfair.\n  When it comes to the injuries for the women in our society, the aged \nin our society, the minorities in our society, the nonbreadwinners in \nour society, if they cannot prove economic loss, then what do they do? \nThey list it out.\n  They want to make absolutely sure in that particular amendment--if I \ncould find my copy of that Abraham amendment, they talk and they decide \nexactly what they do not want to pay for. They find, yes, joint and \nseveral for everything else, but the term ``noneconomic damages'' means \n``subjective, nonmonetary loss resulting from harm, including pain, \nincluding suffering, including inconvenience, including mental \nsuffering, emotional distress, loss to society and companionship, loss \nof consortium, injury to reputation, and humiliation.''\n  Throw all of that out under this amendment. Forget it. We will not be \nable to prove the several. And we have to start proving that while, at \nthe same time, there has been proof by the greater weight of the \npreponderance of evidence that there has been wrongdoing and that there \nhas been injury and the burden now is the injured party is to be \ninjured further with the Abraham amendment. They are really putting the \nburden on here, and they come in the same breath and say, ``We are \ninterested in the injured parties--namely, consumers.''\n  Now, if anybody believes that, well, I see we are getting around the \ntime when we can vote and others want to speak, but I hope that Members \nwill study this amendment very, very carefully and understand that it \nis not the California rule, like something is wonderful. I run in the \nother direction when I hear about the California rule.\n  If a person wants some liberal things happening and everything else \nof that kind, go to the State of California. I have many, many friends \nout there and they have a big time, but to bring this into rule of the \nUnited States of America and to reverse the majority State laws in our \nNation and not to reverse it on joint and several for economic loss, \nwhich they term ``fair'' and sound but only for noneconomic loss, these \nparticular people in our society, particularly families and those who \nproduce and build the families and say that they are for families, they \nare caught off base on this. I hope they vote against their own \namendment.\n\n\n                 Amendment No. 681 to Amendment No. 596\n\n     (Purpose: To make improvements concerning alternative dispute \n                              resolution)\n\n  Mr. KYL. Madam President, I am simply going to make a unanimous- \n[[Page S6075]] consent request. I ask unanimous consent to lay aside \nthe pending amendment and offer an amendment, which I send to the desk \nand ask for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Arizona [Mr. Kyl] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 681 to amendment No. 596.\n\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       In section 103, strike all after subsection (a) through the \n     end of the section.\n\n  Mr. KYL. Madam President, just a moment to explain what this \namendment is. I know we are getting close to the time to vote, and the \nSenator from Connecticut wishes to speak, as well.\n  This section 103 is titled ``Alternative Dispute Resolution \nProcedures.'' It establishes that in a jurisdiction where an \nalternative dispute resolution procedure is provided for, that either \nthe claimants or the defendant may utilize such procedure. That is \npoint one. Of course, that does not change anything or add anything to \nexisting law.\n  The second part of this provides how the procedure shall be utilized. \nAgain, that adds nothing to the existing law.\n  The third part of section 103 establishes that if the defendant \nrefuses to go along with or to accept the plaintiff's request and \ncertain other conditions are satisfied, then the defendant shall be \nfound liable for attorney's fees and costs. That is, in effect, the \nBritish rule, the loser pays. But there is no such provision for \nplaintiffs.\n  I thought this was merely an oversight. Obviously both parties to a \nlitigation should be accorded the same rights under the rules of \nprocedure. But it is not an oversight. I am told that certain Members \nof the body require this dichotomy in the rules in order to vote in \nfavor of the bill.\n  Madam President, if that is what it takes we should not be doing it. \nThis is grossly unfair. It would be an absolute and total departure \nfrom everything that our legal system stands for. All parties to \nlitigation plead their cases, defend their cases, prosecute their cases \nunder the same set of rules. We do not have rules that apply to one \nside but that do not apply to another; particularly where we are trying \nto avoid litigation in the first place by providing for alternative \ndispute resolution.\n  So, where a State has such a procedure we ought to be encouraging \nboth parties to go through such a procedure. If there is to be a \npenalty attached, then that penalty should be the same for either \nparty. If there is not, that is the business of the State jurisdiction. \nBut the Federal Government should not be interceding and saying if a \nState has such a procedure it only applies to the defendant; plaintiff \nis under no obligation to go through with it if requested by the \ndefendant.\n  So, Madam President, we will talk more about this tomorrow but I \nwanted my colleagues to know that this gross unfairness does need to be \ncorrected in the bill. It is a very simple amendment, but I will be \nasking my colleagues to support this amendment tomorrow.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Madam President, I wanted to send an amendment to desk \nto get in line here. I ask unanimous consent to temporarily lay aside \nthe pending amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                 Amendment No. 682 To Amendment No. 596\n\n    (Purpose: To provide for product liability insurance reporting)\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Madam President, I send an amendment to the desk and \nask for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from South Carolina [Mr. Hollings] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 682 to amendment No. 596.\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n     SEC.   . PRODUCT LIABILITY INSURANCE REPORTING.\n\n       (a) Report to Congress.--The Secretary of Commerce \n     (hereafter in this section referred to as the ``Secretary'') \n     shall provide to the Congress before June 30 of each year \n     after the date of enactment of this Act a report analyzing \n     the impact of this Act on insurers which issue product \n     liability insurance either separately or in conjunction with \n     other insurance; and on self-insurers, captive insurers, and \n     risk retention groups.\n       (b) Collection of Data.--To carry out the purposes of this \n     section, the Secretary shall collect from each insurer all \n     data considered necessary by the Secretary to present and \n     analyze fully the impact of this Act on such insurers.\n       (c) Regulations.--Within 120 days after the date of \n     enactment of this Act, the Secretary shall issue such \n     regulations as may be necessary to implement the purposes, \n     and carry out the provisions, of this section. Such \n     regulations shall be promulgated in accordance with section \n     553 of title 5, United States Code. Such regulations shall--\n       (1) require the reporting of information sufficiently \n     comprehensive to make possible a full evaluation of the \n     impact of this Act on such insurers;\n       (2) specify the information to be provided by such insurers \n     and the format of such information, taking into account \n     methods to minimize the paperwork and cost burdens on such \n     insurers and the Federal Government; and\n       (3) provide, to the maximum extent practicable, that such \n     information is obtained from existing sources, including, but \n     not limited to, State insurance commissioners, recognized \n     insurance statistical agencies, the Administrative Office of \n     the United States Courts, and the National Center for State \n     Courts.\n       (d) Subpoena.--The Secretary may subpoena witnesses and \n     records related to the report required under this section \n     from any place in the United States. If a witness disobeys \n     such a subpoena, the Secretary may petition any district \n     court of the United States to enforce such subpoena. The \n     court may punish a refusal to obey an order of the court to \n     comply with such a subpoena as a contempt of court.\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Madam President, this is simply the amendment we had on \nprevious product liability bills. It was actually proposed by the \ndistinguished colleague, Senator Rockefeller from West Virginia. It has \nto do with product liability insurance reporting.\n  Not to delay the Senator from Washington or the Senator from \nConnecticut, both of whom I thank very much for yielding, I will debate \nit later on.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n\n\n                 Amendment No. 618 to Amendment No. 596\n\n  Mr. GORTON. Madam President, I had earlier announced I would move to \ntable the Thompson amendment at 5:45. I do see on the floor my \ndistinguished colleague and cosponsor, the Senator from Connecticut, \nwho has not spoken on any of these issues today.\n  I ask him if he would like to do so? I am going to certainly defer my \nmotion to table.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Madam President, replying to my friend and colleague \nfrom Washington, I would appreciate the opportunity to speak for just 4 \nor 5 minutes, if I may at this time, on the Thompson amendment.\n  Madam President, we have proceeded, now, for several days on the \ntopic of product liability reform. Those of us who have sponsored the \nunderlying bill, a bipartisan group, have argued that the current \nsystem of product liability litigation is costly, it is unfair, too \nmuch of the money put into the system goes to those who are operating \nit instead of the victims of actual negligence.\n  We have proceeded and brought several important issues to votes, not \nonly on product liability but on the general topic of medical \nmalpractice, punitive damages--a creative approach offered and accepted \nby more than 60 of our colleagues, by the occupant of the chair, the \ndistinguished Senator from Maine.\n  I think we have a consistent pattern in which a majority of Members \nof the Chamber, of this Senate, have spoken in favor of reform, \nacknowledging that the status quo in the civil justice system, when it \ncomes to tort law, is just not working as it should. It is not working \nin the interests of the American people. It is not working in the \ninterests of the American consumer who is paying too much and getting \ntoo little. It is certainly not working in the interests of American \nbusiness and American workers because it is denying us products. It is \nmaking us less competitive. It is denying employment opportunities. I \nsay all of that as a preface to saying just a few brief words about the \namendment offered by the \n[[Page S6076]] Senator from Tennessee, Mr. Thompson, joined also by \nSenators Simon and Cochran.\n  With all respect to my three colleagues, the record will note that \nthey have not been, generally speaking, among those who have voted for \nthe reform effort, the tort reform effort. I would say, respectfully \nagain, that a vote for this amendment will have the effect of making \nhollow the effort to achieve genuine product liability reform--genuine \ntort reform. It would make it hollow in taking unto itself the banner \nof federalism and States rights, as it were--but it does so in a way \nthat is not true to the actual content of the bill before us and is not \nreally true to federalism either.\n  The fact is, the underlying bill leaves almost all of the fundamental \nquestions of liability still with the States but it acknowledges that \nthis area of our law has national implications. It is a national \nproblem and it requires a national solution. By restricting the impact \nof these reforms to the Federal courts, this amendment essentially \neviscerates--it guts the bill. It will not any longer be true reform.\n  There are some who have described the underlying bill as too weak. We \nlike to say it is moderate. It is balanced--I believe it is. It is the \nway it ought to go forward. But if this amendment is agreed to, there \nwill be very little left and it will be much less than moderate.\n  Madam President, let me just say specifically that the impact of this \namendment would be to enable attorneys, plaintiff's attorneys, to shop \nfor appropriate jurisdictions in which to, even more than under the \ncurrent law, file their suits in State courts. But more significant and \nperhaps a point that has not been mentioned enough, plaintiff's \nattorneys here will be motivated to immediately add resident defendants \nto the complaint so as to avoid removal to Federal court. Under current \nlegal practice, under current law, any time there is a defendant in a \nsuit from the same State as plaintiff, diversity of jurisdiction, which \nis a prerequisite to obtaining Federal court jurisdiction, is defeated. \nThus, plaintiffs can easily control here whether Federal law will apply \nand can frustrate the attempt to finally, after 18 years of attempts in \nthis Senate, in this Congress, to reform. They can frustrate that \nattempt. It also means that more people will be sued, more small \nbusinesses will be sued, that lawsuits will cost even more.\n  So we are trying to achieve a modest level of uniformity in the \nunderlying amendment in an effort to reform the inequitable, costly, \nslow system we now have. The amendment offered by the Senator from \nTennessee will doom any effort to achieve those moderate results, and, \ntherefore, I strongly urge my colleagues, again a majority of whom have \nexpressed their clear desire for reform, to be consistent with that \nexpressed desire for reform and to vote against the amendment offered \nby the Senator from Tennessee.\n  I thank the Chair and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mr. GORTON. Madam President, almost 6 years ago the U.S. Supreme \nCourt decision named Erie Railroad versus Tompkins did all it possibly \ncould to consolidate and rationalize the law relating to actions \nbrought or removed to Federal courts under diversity of jurisdiction by \nruling that Federal courts were required to follow State law in such \ncases. So that it would cut back on forum shopping by lawyers who were \nlooking for a more favorable law than within their own State by \nchoosing between State or Federal courts.\n  For almost 60 years that has been the law and it has worked well. \nThis bill is designed to reduce further the lack of uniformity, \nshopping among the various States.\n  The Thompson amendment instead of having 50 different jurisdictions \nand rules with respect to product liability litigation would result in \n100 because the rule of the Federal court in Connecticut would be \ndifferent from the rule in the State court in Connecticut. The rule in \nthe Federal court in West Virginia would be different than the rule in \nthe State court in West Virginia or Washington or Maine. So we would \nhave more confusion, more forum shopping, and less uniformity.\n  That is why primarily the Thompson amendment should be defeated \nending this debate.\n  Madam President, I ask for the regular order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The regular order is the amendment offered by \nthe Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. GORTON. I move to table the Thompson amendment and ask for the \nyeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the motion of \nthe Senator from Washington to lay on the table the amendment of the \nSenator from Tennessee. On this question, the yeas and nays have been \nordered, and the clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. FORD. I announce that the Senator from Rhode Island [Mr. Pell] is \nnecessarily absent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Bennett). Are there any other Senators in \nthe Chamber who desire to vote?\n  The result was announced--yeas 58, nays 41, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 147 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--58\n\n     Abraham\n     Ashcroft\n     Bennett\n     Bond\n     Brown\n     Burns\n     Campbell\n     Chafee\n     Coats\n     Conrad\n     Coverdell\n     Craig\n     DeWine\n     Dodd\n     Dole\n     Domenici\n     Dorgan\n     Exon\n     Faircloth\n     Feinstein\n     Frist\n     Glenn\n     Gorton\n     Gramm\n     Grams\n     Grassley\n     Gregg\n     Hatch\n     Hatfield\n     Helms\n     Hutchison\n     Inhofe\n     Jeffords\n     Kassebaum\n     Kempthorne\n     Kohl\n     Kyl\n     Lieberman\n     Lott\n     Lugar\n     Mack\n     McCain\n     McConnell\n     Mikulski\n     Murkowski\n     Nickles\n     Nunn\n     Pressler\n     Pryor\n     Robb\n     Rockefeller\n     Santorum\n     Smith\n     Snowe\n     Stevens\n     Thomas\n     Thurmond\n     Warner\n\n                                NAYS--41\n\n     Akaka\n     Baucus\n     Biden\n     Bingaman\n     Boxer\n     Bradley\n     Breaux\n     Bryan\n     Bumpers\n     Byrd\n     Cochran\n     Cohen\n     D'Amato\n     Daschle\n     Feingold\n     Ford\n     Graham\n     Harkin\n     Heflin\n     Hollings\n     Inouye\n     Johnston\n     Kennedy\n     Kerrey\n     Kerry\n     Lautenberg\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Moseley-Braun\n     Moynihan\n     Murray\n     Packwood\n     Reid\n     Roth\n     Sarbanes\n     Shelby\n     Simon\n     Simpson\n     Specter\n     Thompson\n     Wellstone\n\n                             NOT VOTING--1\n\n       \n     Pell\n       \n  So the motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote by which the \nmotion was agreed to.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. GORTON. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HEFLIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HEFLIN. Mr. President, I would like to address some of the \nunderlying provisions in the product liability bill which I feel are \nunfair.\n  No. 1 is that in the definition of claimant and person, the language \nbrings within the purview of this bill a Government entity. This means \ncities, counties, State Government, the Federal Government. The statute \nof repose could be very important as we look at the United States Army \nrelative to damages it might suffer.\n  I think most of the vehicles in the Army we know are designed to last \na long time--helicopters, NASA vehicles, and so forth. Why the \nproponents want to include a Government entity within the provisions of \nthis statute raises a lot of questions to me.\n  Now they pretty well exempt rental cars, lease property from product \nliability. I gave an illustration earlier that you might have a \nsituation in which a recall is sent by the manufacturer, but the rental \ncar agency decides to continue to lease the car with knowledge that \nthere are dangers that might be in the car. I just mention that.\n  [[Page S6077]] Also, in the calculation of several damages in the \nbill itself and in the Abraham amendment, there is language to the \neffect that in the several liability and the percentage of harm, that \nit does not have to be a party to the lawsuit. Therefore, you have \nsituations where there could be companies in bankruptcy where you could \nnot get jurisdiction. And then you could have a situation where, in the \nabsence of service, you could not bring it; or it could be that the \nstatute of limitations has run before someone recognizes that part of \nit is not to the lawsuit, to get service on, relative to that matter. \nUnder most workman's compensation laws, it not only means that you \ncannot bring a lawsuit against your employer, but also against \ncoemployees. Yet, you have the right under this, whether party to a \nlawsuit or not--the jury would be obligated to set a percentage of the \nfault against that party. And that party would not be there to defend \nthemselves. They would not want to become involved in a lawsuit. They \nare the only ones who really know their defenses and the amount of \ntheir responsibility pertaining to the fault that might occur. So, in \neffect, therefore, they would gang up against a party who was not a \ndefendant in the lawsuit.\n  Then there is language in regard to misuse or alteration, which is a \ndefense that reduces the damage. But, again, it is carefully worded for \nan advantage. It says, ``. . . misuse or alteration by any person, \nregardless of whether they are a defendant in the lawsuit.''\n  And then you have, in this bill, to show you how it is worded, in the \nlawsuit if you have several defendants and they are not parties--the \nemployer and the employee cannot be made--in most instances, the \ncoemployee cannot be made a party to a lawsuit and is protected because \nof workman's compensation. Then it says that the last issue to be tried \nin the lawsuit is the percentage of the fault that falls on the \nemployer or the coemployee.\n  So they want it to be fresh in the minds of the jury as being the \nlast issue that is tried. That is another slight advantage that they \nare always working in regard to this. The draftsmen of this are keen \npeople who have represented defendants, and they are knowledgeable \nabout defending lawsuits and are trying to get an advantage rather than \ntrying to be fair to the injured party. And then it has the provision \nthat you cannot settle without the insurance company or the workman's \ncompensation agreement. If you want to settle for 75 cents on the \ndollar, the workman's compensation insurer will not let you do that \nbecause they want 100 percent. That is another example of the bill's \nunfairness.\n  Now, there are a lot of lawsuits on asbestos injury. It would apply \nto asbestos, except there is some provision pertaining to the statute \nof repose relative to asbestos, calling it a ``toxic'' matter.\n  The bill has a provision for businesses coming under the provisions \nof the Uniform Commercial Code regarding commercial loss, where \nbusinesses are therefore given an advantage. Well, under the uniform \ncommercial code, it has generally, under warranties, a 4-year statute \nof limitations; whereas, under this bill, the injured worker has only 2 \nyears in a statute of limitations. That is another advantage that is \nput in there for the benefit of the manufacturer.\n  Another aspect relates to implied warranty. The bill abolishes the \nconcept of implied warranty as a cause of action. Implied warranty \nbasically is a concept that says that the product is fit for the \npurpose for which it is sold. But under the language of the bill, there \nare several implied warranties. There is an implied warranty of \nmerchantability, and other implied warranties are involved. Under this \nlanguage, it allows the only warranty that you can, have a cause of \naction for or sue on is an express warranty.\n  So, therefore, all a seller of goods has to do, if he has knowledge \nof defects, is to keep his mouth shut. He just does not say anything. \nUnder the normal law, if he says nothing, but he has knowledge, then \nthe implied warranty could be found. But unless a seller expressly \nwarrants a product, he is exempt from liability. Then there could be an \ninstance in regard to the Uniform Commercial Code relative to privity \nof contract. You have to have privity of contract, actual contractual \nrelations; it would be a limited effect where it would come into play, \nbut it is still an advantage the bill's proponents are seeking.\n  I wanted to mention those. Of course, as the bill presently stands, \nthe drug companies are almost completely immune from any lawsuit. \nRegarding pharmaceutical companies--drugs--there is just about an \nimpossibility the way it is presently framed to recover against them. \nThe biomaterial section is still one where they have written it in such \na manner that it has language that is most unusual. They say that if a \nmaterial comes in contact with bodily fluids or with tissue and remains \nfor less than 30 days, less than 30 days could be 1 minute. It could be \n5 minutes. When it talks about less than 30 days, it says that that \ncomes in contact through a surgical opening.\n  What is a surgical opening? A surgical opening could be a needle that \nis stuck into you, a needle, a hypodermic device that goes in the body \nto draw blood or administer a drug or medicine. That is, in effect, a \nsurgical opening. If it stays there 30 seconds, then it comes under the \nclassification, the way this is written, of being an implant. And, \ntherefore, if you are a component part of the implant under the \nbiomaterials section that we have here, you have just about a complete \nimmunity. The only way you could do it would be that you have to prove \nthat the component part was not made by a different party but was made \nby the manufacturer, or that the component part was made by the \nseller--component parts, many times, are made by many and different \npeople--or that it was according to specifications. A lot of times, \nthere are defects relative to specifications on these.\n  I point out that there are a lot more snakes, as I call them, \ninvolved in this. Every time you read it, you discover another one of \nthese snakes wiggling in the grass. Each of them are big issues.\n  I think we have concentrated too much relative to punitive damages, \nbecause there are so many other issues involved in this that are just \nas big in taking away the rights of injured persons. I wanted to point \nthose out. I thought some others would be on the floor but, as usual, \nsome will leave before too long. Maybe I made a point in that regard.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I am afraid the distinguished Senator \nand myself are probably running them off the floor.\n  Mr. President, I have submitted an amendment which is presently at \nthe desk. I understand from the managers of the bill that the intent \nnow is to hear about these amendments this evening, and then in the \nmorning, and it is up to the majority and minority leaders.\n  As they have told me about it thus far, perhaps around 12:15, we \nwould start voting on three amendments: The amendment of the \ndistinguished Senator from Michigan, Senator Abraham; I think it is a \nsecond-degree amendment by the distinguished Senator from Arizona, \nSenator Kyl; and my amendment.\n  With respect to my amendment, entitled Product Liability Insurance \nReporting, it struck me at the time of the hearing, the official on \nbehalf of the Government appeared, said that the National Governors' \nAssociation policies makes three major points about product liability. \nThe first urges Congress to adopt a uniform product liability code; \nsecond, the Congress to assess and if necessary enhancing Federal \nconsumer protection and product safety standards; third, calls for more \neffective oversight of the insurance industry. There is absolutely \nnone.\n  In fact, the attempts over the years to try to determine anything at \nall about casualty carriers, their costs, their rates, their losses, \nthe availability of insurance and otherwise, has been a tremendous \nproblem at the Federal level because we have left it generally to the \nStates.\n  Back 9 years ago in the hearings we were having at that time--because \nwe only had cursory hearings on the bill this time--when we were having \nhearings in depth, it was a matter of unanimity out of our committee \nwhen Senators from Kentucky and West Virginia got together reaching a \nsignificant agreement.\n  [[Page S6078]] I quote the Senator from West Virginia, Senator \nRockefeller, the primary cosponsor with Senator Gorton of Washington of \nthis particular bill that we now have before the Senate:\n\n       The Senator from Kentucky and I have reached a significant \n     agreement which I think achieves a significant goal in an \n     eminently sensible manner. The amendment is before you and \n     ensures for the first time that the Secretary of Commerce \n     will collect--not ``may collect'' but ``will collect''--\n     comprehensive product liability insurance data which will be \n     useful to us as policy makers at the Federal and State \n     levels.\n       The amendment in effect makes it possible that should this \n     issue be revisited, Congress will in fact have the facts \n     before us. Okay. So what is in the amendment?\n       The amendment would require the Secretary of Commerce to \n     report comprehensive information annually to the Congress on \n     the effect of this product liability tort reform bill, should \n     it pass, on those insurers, noninsurers, reinsurers, self-\n     insurers, risk retention folks, who issue product liability \n     insurance.\n       Now the Secretary of Commerce will collect data from these \n     folks, and he can collect data from existing insurance \n     statistical agencies. In other words, the bureaucracy factor \n     is minimized, Mr. Chairman, because he can collect it from \n     those who already produce it.\n       However, a key component of my agreement with the \n     distinguished Senator from Kentucky provides that the \n     committee report--and we crafted our language carefully \n     here--will spell out for the Secretary what information is \n     needed for comprehensive understanding of the issue. For \n     example, insurers premiums and investment income, outlays, \n     overhead, legal expenses, reserves, as well as claims paid as \n     a result of settlement as opposed to claims paid as a result \n     of adjudication.\n       Included in the report language will be a provision that \n     the National Association of Insurance Commissioners has a set \n     amount of time to work out an agreement with the Secretary of \n     Commerce to require that insurers report data on claims paid \n     out as a result of economic, noneconomic, and punitive \n     damages. That has been an elusive factor, and that \n     information in fact is not now available or at least it is \n     not broken out. As a result of this amendment, it will be, \n     and will be available to us.\n       I believe, Mr. Chairman, it is a good amendment. I believe \n     it is a fair amendment. It is not the amendment which I had \n     originally suggested, but I believe that it is a reasonable \n     compromise that gets us the same information and in a \n     reasonable manner.\n\n  Now, that was presented in the bill and accepted. Thereafter, year \nbefore last, when we had on the last occasion before the Senate product \nliability, that amendment, word for word, was presented and accepted. \nPresented by this Senator at that particular time as the chairman of \nthe Commerce Committee and accepted by none other than the two \ndistinguished leaders that we have, the cosponsors and managers of the \nbill, the distinguished Senator from West Virginia and the \ndistinguished Senator from Washington.\n  My hope, of course, that the amendment was accepted, it would be \naccepted again. Perhaps we will have to vote on it. However, it would \nnonplus this particular Senator that here we have what the managers \nthemselves have not only promulgated but what they have accepted \nheretofore as a reasonable, proper, and necessary add on to the \nconsideration of product liability and now rejected at this particular \ntime. With that in mind, I yield the floor.\n\n\n          Amendment No. 599, as modified, to Amendment No. 596\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the pending \namendment be set aside to call up this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that amendment \nnumbered 599, as previously agreed to, be modified with the language \nwhich I now send to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment (No. 599), as modified, is as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following new section:\n\n     SEC.   . REPRESENTATIONS AND SANCTIONS UNDER RULE 11 FEDERAL \n                   RULES OF CIVIL PROCEDURE.\n\n       (a) In General.--Rule 11 of the Federal Rules of Civil \n     Procedure is amended--\n       (1) in subsection (b)(3) by striking out ``or, if \n     specifically so identified, are likely to have evidentiary \n     support after a reasonable opportunity for further \n     investigation or discovery'' and inserting in lieu thereof \n     ``or are well grounded in fact''; and\n       (2) in subsection (c)--\n       (A) in the first sentence by striking out ``may, subject to \n     the conditions stated below,'' and inserting in lieu thereof \n     ``may'';\n       (B) in paragraph (2) by striking out the first and second \n     sentences and inserting in lieu thereof the following: ``A \n     sanction imposed for violation of this rule may consist of \n     reasonable attorneys' fees and other expenses incurred as a \n     result of the violation, directives of a nonmonetary nature, \n     or an order to pay penalty into court or to a party.''; and\n       (C) in paragraph (2)(A) by inserting before the period ``, \n     although such sanctions may be awarded against a party's \n     attorneys''.\n       (b) Effective Date.--The provisions of this section shall \n     take effect 30 days after the date of the enactment of this \n     Act.\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, this amendment was offered by Senator Brown \nand adopted by the Senate earlier this week. We have consulted with \nSenator Brown and he has agreed to our modification.\n  Section (2)(A) of Senator Brown's amendment would make the imposition \nof sanctions for a violation of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11 \nmandatory. The current Federal rule gives Federal judges discretion to \naward sanctions if a violation has occurred. This amendment simply \nrestores discretion to our Federal judges to award sanctions in the \nappropriate cases.\n                 Amendment No. 683 to Amendment No. 596\n\n  (Purpose: To revise the rules regarding claimants who are employees)\n\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The pending amendments will be set aside and \nthe clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Washington [Mr. Gorton] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 683 to amendment No. 596.\n\n  Mr. GORTON. I ask unanimous consent further reading be dispensed.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 2, strike lines 4 through 14 and insert the \n     following:\n       (2) Claimant's benefits.--The term ``claimant's benefits'' \n     means the amount paid to an employee as workers' compensation \n     benefits.\n       On page 25, line 15, strike ``consent'' and insert \n     ``notification''.\n\n     On page 25, beginning with ``subparagraph'' on line 16 strike \n     through line 25 and insert ``subparagraph (C), an employee \n     shall not make any settlement with or accept any payment from \n     the manufacturer or product seller without written \n     notification to the employer.''.\n\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, this is a corrective amendment with \nrespect to the subrogation provisions of the workmen's compensation \nsection. I have checked this out with the distinguished Senator from \nSouth Carolina. It is not controversial.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 683) was agreed to.\n\n\n                 Amendment No. 684 to Amendment No. 596\n\n      (Purpose: To modify the rented or leased products provision)\n\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I send another amendment to the desk for \nimmediate consideration, and I ask the pending amendment be set aside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Washington [Mr. Gorton], proposes an \n     amendment numbered 684 to amendment No. 596.\n\n  Mr. GORTON. I ask unanimous consent further reading be dispensed.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 16, line 21, after ``but'' insert ``any person \n     engaged in the business of renting or leasing a product''.\n\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, this falls under the same category, \ndealing with the definition of a rental.\n  I have checked it out with Senator Hollings and it is acceptable and \nagreed to and not controversial.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 684) was agreed to.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/05/03/senate-section/article/S6068-2", "month": "05", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "03", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6078-S6079]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    ORDERS FOR THURSDAY, MAY 4, 1995\n\n  Mr. DOLE.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 16, between lines 14 and 15, insert the following: \n     ``For purposes of this subsection only, the statute of \n     limitations applicable to claims asserting liability of a \n     product seller as a manufacturer shall be tolled from the \n     date of the filing of a complaint against the manufacturer to \n     the date that judgment is entered against the manufacturer.''\n\n  Mr. GORTON.

Also \ntransmitted is a section-by-section analysis.\n  Some of the most significant provisions of this proposal will:\n  --Authorize the Attorney General to increase the Border Patrol by no \n    fewer than 700 agents and add sufficient personnel to support those \n    agents for fiscal years 1996, 1997, and 1998.\n  --Authorize the Attorney General to increase the number of border \n    inspectors to a level adequate to assure full staffing.\n  --Authorize an Employment Verification Pilot Program to conduct tests \n    of various methods of verifying work authorization status, \n    including using the Social Security Administration and INS \n    databases. The Pilot Program will determine the most cost-\n    effective, fraud-resistant, and nondiscriminatory means of removing \n    a significant incentive to illegal immigration--employment in the \n    United States.\n  --Reduce the number of documents that may be used for employment \n    authorization.\n  --Increase substantially the penalties for alien smuggling, illegal \n    reentry, failure to depart, employer violations, and immigration \n    document fraud.\n  --Streamline deportation and exclusion procedures so that the INS can \n    expeditiously remove more criminal aliens from the United States.\n  --Allow aliens to be excluded from entering the United States during \n    extraordinary migration situations or when the aliens are arriving \n    on board smuggling vessels. Persons with a credible fear of \n    persecution in their countries of nationality would be allowed to \n    enter the United States to apply for asylum.\n  --Expand the use of the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt \n    Organizations (RICO) statute to authorize its use to pursue alien \n    smuggling organizations; permit the INS, with judicial \n    authorization, to intercept wire, electronic, and oral \n    communications of persons involved in alien smuggling operations; \n    and make subject to forfeiture all property, both real and \n    personal, used or intended to be used to smuggle aliens.\n[[Page S6080]]   --Authorize Federal courts to require criminal aliens \n    to consent to their deportation as a condition of probation.\n  --Permit new sanctions to be imposed against countries that refuse to \n    accept the deportation of their nationals from the United States. \n    The proposal will allow the Secretary of State to refuse issuance \n    of all visas to nationals of those countries.\n  --Authorize a Border Services User Fee to help add additional \n    inspectors at high volume ports-of-entry. The new inspectors will \n    facilitate legal crossings; prevent entry by illegal aliens; and \n    stop cross-border drug smuggling. (Border States, working with \n    local communities, would decide whether the fee should be imposed \n    in order to improve infrastructure.)\n  This legislative proposal, together with my FY 1996 Budget and the \nFebruary 7th Presidential Memorandum, will continue this \nAdministration's unprecedented actions to combat illegal immigration \nwhile facilitating legal immigration. Our comprehensive strategy will \nprotect the integrity of our borders and laws without dulling the \nluster of our Nation's proud immigrant heritage.\n  I urge the prompt and favorable consideration of this legislative \nproposal by the Congress.\n                                                  William J.

This \ncomprehensive Act, together with the ``Omnibus Counterterrorism Act of \n1995,'' which I transmitted to the Congress on February 9, 1995, are \ncritically important components of my Administration's effort to combat \ndomestic and international terrorism.\n  The tragic bombing of the Murrah Federal Building in Oklahoma City on \nApril 19th stands as a challenge to all Americans to preserve a safe \nsociety. In the wake of this cowardly attack on innocent men, women, \nand children, following other terrorist incidents at home and abroad \nover the past several years, we must ensure that law enforcement \nauthorities have the legal tools and resources they need to fight \nterrorism. The Antiterrorism Amendments Act of 1995 will help us to \nprevent terrorism through vigorous and effective investigation and \nprosecution. Major provisions of this Act would:\n  --Permit law enforcement agencies to gain access to financial and \n    credit reports in antiterrorism cases, as is currently permitted \n    with bank records. This would allow such agencies to track the \n    source and use of funds by suspected terrorists.\n  --Apply the same legal standard in national security cases that is \n    currently used in other criminal cases for obtaining permission to \n    track telephone traffic with ``pen registers'' and ``trap and \n    trace'' devices.\n  --Enable law enforcement agencies to utilize the national security \n    letter process to obtain records critical to terrorism \n    investigations from hotels, motels, common carriers, storage \n    facilities, and vehicle rental facilities.\n  --Expand the authority of law enforcement agencies to conduct \n    electronic surveillance, within constitutional safeguards. Examples \n    of this increased authority include additions to the list of \n    felonies that can be used as the basis for a surveillance order, \n    and enhancement of law enforcement's ability to keep pace with \n    telecommunications technology by obtaining multiple point wiretaps \n    where it is impractical to specify the number of the phone to be \n    tapped (such as the use of a series of cellular phones).\n  --Require the Department of the Treasury's Bureau of Alcohol, \n    Tobacco, and Firearms to study the inclusion of taggants \n    (microscopic particles) in standard explosive device raw materials \n    to permit tracing the source of those materials after an explosion; \n    whether common chemicals used to manufacture explosives can be \n    rendered inert; and whether controls can be imposed on certain \n    basic chemicals used to manufacture other explosives.\n  --Require the inclusion of taggants in standard explosive device raw \n    materials after the publication of implementing regulations by the \n    Secretary of the Treasury.\n  --Enable law enforcement agencies to call on the special expertise of \n    the Department of Defense in addressing offenses involving chemical \n    and biological weapons.\n  --Make mandatory at least a 10-year penalty for transferring firearms \n    or explosives with knowledge that they will be used to commit a \n    crime of violence and criminalize the possession of stolen \n    explosives.\n  --Impose enhanced penalties for terrorist attacks against current and \n    former Federal employees, and their families, when the crime is \n    committed because of the employee's official duties.\n  --Provide a source of funds for the digital telephone bill, which I \n    signed into law last year, ensuring court-authorized law \n    enforcement access to electronic surveillance of digitized \n    communications.\n  These proposals are described in more detail in the enclosed section-\nby-section analysis.\n  The Administration is prepared to work immediately with the Congress \nto enact antiterrorism legislation. My legislation will provide an \neffective and comprehensive response to the threat of terrorism, while \nalso protecting our precious civil liberties. I urge the prompt and \nfavorable consideration of the Administration's legislative proposals \nby the Congress.\n                                                  William J.

A bill to require the National Park Service to eradicate \nbrucellosis afflicting the bison in Yellowstone National Park, and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n\n\n            THE YELLOWSTONE NATIONAL PARK BISON ACT OF 1995\n\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I rise to introduce legislation that is \nimportant to the future, I think, of the livestock industry, not only \nof Montana, but Washington, Idaho, and Wyoming and, also, I think to \nthe Nation. Wherever the Government has a large concentration or a \nlarge presence, I think it has to be called upon to be a good neighbor. \nThis legislation, which is long overdue, is as a result of the \nineffectiveness of the Federal Government--especially the Park \nService--to follow up on the work that it has been directed to \ncomplete. This bill will require the National Park Service to \neffectively manage a disease ridden herd of bison within the boundaries \nof the Yellowstone Park.\n  Mr. President, for years, the bison within the Yellowstone Park have \ncarried brucellosis. It is a disease which causes cattle or bovines to \nabort their calves. When transmitted to humans, the disease can create \na very painful and incurable disease known as undulant fever. This is a \ndisease which the Animal Plant Health Inspection Service of the \nDepartment of Agriculture has targeted for complete eradication from \nthe United States by 1998. The bison herd in Yellowstone Park is the \nonly remaining major free-roaming herd in the Nation where nothing has \nbeen done to eradicate the disease.\n  Brucellosis is a disease which the livestock industry in the United \nStates has spent untold millions of dollars to eliminate, done on a \nState-by-State program. In my State of Montana, the stockgrowers have \nspent almost $70 million to eradicate the disease and set up barriers \nin order to protect their herds. Yet, due to the continual delays in \nthe Yellowstone National Park Service to address the remedy of the \nsituation there in that park, the future of the livestock industry in \nMontana, the Nation, and the region, continues to be threatened by \ndisastrous result which are a direct consequence of the disease. In \naddition, to the cost incurred by the livestock industry, there has \nbeen a cost to the State of Montana to protect its borders from the \nwandering herds of bison which roam outside the park every winter \nseeking forage.\n  These bison carry the disease and threaten the grazing lands and the \nherd on private lands in and around the park.\n  Now, I could stand here today and give a complete history of the \nterrible problem faced by States like Montana, Idaho, and Wyoming. For \nthe sake of time, let me talk about this past winter and just exactly \nwhat happens.\n  In November, we had major snows in the park. It did not take long, \nbut within a few weeks, up to five feet of snow had accumulated in \nYellowstone Park, which effectively covered all the forage \nopportunities for the animals in the park.\n  When this occurs, the bison within the park turn and do exactly what \nis natural--they will start drifting between the lower meadows just for \nfood. \n[[Page S6083]] These large creatures are doing just exactly what their \ninstincts tell them to do.\n  In order to protect livestock in our part of the country--and \nlivestock industry and livestock agriculture is the No. 1 industry in \nMontana--we had to find it necessary to bring down these animals that \nwe could not chase back into the park. This past winter, this number \nexceeded almost 400 head.\n  Nobody likes to see this happen, especially when an animal is \nfollowing its own natural instincts for preservation and survival. \nHowever, it is necessary also to protect an economy and the safety of \nmy State of Montana. If the disease were to be transmitted to any herd \nin the State, Montana would lose its brucellosis-free status that was \ngranted by APHIS and the Department of Agriculture.\n  Already this year, the action of nine States has adversely affected \nthe well-being of my cattle industry in the State of Montana. These \nnine States right now are requiring that any cattle transported from \nthe State of Montana be tested for brucellosis, which basically, up \nuntil this incident, had been eradicated and certified free.\n  At the time, the industry is already reeling from a lower market. We \nare having to test all the breeding animals that leave the State of \nMontana, at a cost of $20 to $30 a head, a cost which we thought we \nspent money on to get rid of up until last year.\n  The language of this will require the National Park Service to face \nup to the seriousness of maintaining poor health and bad health \npractices for the herd of buffalo or bison in Yellowstone Park.\n  The animals will be tested and those that will test positive for the \ndisease will be culled from the herd. Those that will test negative \nwill be retained, and the younger animals will start on a program of \nbeing vaccinated. Doing this, over time, will finally eradicate the \ndisease from the park.\n  When this herd was first introduced into the park by the U.S. Army, \nit was thought that there would be some sort of management plan to \ncontrol the population. However, in the mid-1960's, the National Park \nService developed a hands-off policy in relationship to the number of \nbison that could run in Yellowstone Park.\n  This action has increased the size of the herd and also increased the \noutbreaks of the disease. By increasing the herd size, the management \nof the park has increased the movement of the herd outside the park. \nThe land mass within the park boundaries cannot sustain a herd of \npresent size.\n  Anybody who would drive across the park would say that range \nconditions and the carrying capacity, we just have too much livestock \nin that part of the world, that little corner of the world, to sustain \nthat herd. I think our estimated population went up to around 4,300, \nand by anybody's estimate it should be around 1,500. The provision of \nthis bill will allow the Park Service to manage the size of that herd.\n  Mr. President, I appreciate the time to address this issue. This \nlegislation is very important, not only, I think, for the livestock \nindustry that would be affected in the States of Montana, Wyoming, and \nIdaho; I think it also shows that wherever Government has a presence, \nand is required to be or called upon to be a good neighbor, just like \nnot asking the Park Service to do anything that we do not ask of an \nindividual producer in the State of Montana, should this disease break \nout in a private herd. They, too, are asked to test, to cull, and to \nvaccinate, to get on a herd health program that takes this disease out \nof the livestock industry.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 745\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Social Security Act to provide certain \nreforms to welfare programs, and for other purposes; to the Committee \non Finance.\n\n\n     the economic opportunity and family responsibility act of 1995\n\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. Mr. President. today I am introducing the Economic \nOpportunity and Family Responsibility Act of 1995. This bill seeks to \nreform the current welfare system in a way that protects children, \nsupports families, and facilitates the transition from welfare to work, \nand it acknowledges what the debate in Congress has heretofore \noverlooked, moving recipients from welfare to work costs money, \nrequires job creation, and will fail without transitional support \nservices like health care and child care.\n  My bill also acknowledges that it takes two to make a baby and it \nincludes strong child support provisions. At the same time, it \nacknowledges that some fathers would like to participate financially in \nthe lives of their children, but cannot, due to under or unemployment. \nThe bill provides assistance for them, too.\n  For me, the bottom line is ensuring that children are protected. The \none question we must ask ourselves when evaluating various welfare \nreform proposals is, ``what about the children?'' Every provision in my \nbill seeks to improve the condition of children through economic \nopportunity for families and maintaining a minimum safety net for \nchildren. This country's future prosperity will be based on the \naccomplishments of all of our children. We do not have a child to \nwaste.\n  I developed this legislation in conjunction with an advisory panel \ncomposed of Illinois academicians, advocacy organizations, State \nofficials, and recipients. Their work and insight has been invaluable \nto this effort.\n  I wish to thank them for all their help.\n  The Senate Finance Committee has completed hearings on welfare reform \nand will soon consider specific proposals. Those on both sides of the \naisle are committed to reform. The current system is broken and \nsignificant changes are necessary. Over 5 million families receive \nAFDC. While most leave welfare within 2 years, many cycle back on and \noff, and a small number are chronic welfare recipients. Recipients want \nto work, and I believe work is \n[[Page S6084]] both a policy and moral necessity. Unfortunately, the \ncurrent welfare system is fraught with disincentives.\n  There are disincentives to work and disincentives to marry. The \nsystem also forces States to spend too much time on administrative and \nprocess issues. The incentives, Mr. President, are in the wrong places \nand work is not a requirement for receipt of the benefit. I think on \nthese things we all agree.\n  Where there is disagreement, but hopefully an opportunity to build \nsome consensus, is how to devise and implement a system that will \naccomplish the goal.\n  The House has chosen to turn the problem over to the States by ending \nthe entitlement status of AFDC and other programs that provide \nassistance to low-income families and replacing them with block grants \nto the States. I believe the House action was taken hastily and fails \nin many respects to identify proposed solutions to the underlying \nproblems of our Nation's welfare system.\n  The Economic Opportunity and Family Responsibility Act, which I am \nintroducing today, recognizes that welfare is simply a response to \npoverty. In 1993 in this country, 39.9 million Americans were poor; 22 \npercent of all children live in poverty, and more than half of all \nfemale-headed households, or 53 percent, are poor. Female-headed \nhouseholds account for 23 percent of all families.\n  This Nation and this Government cannot give up on improving living \nconditions for the poor. We cannot abdicate our responsibility for \nensuring that America provides an opportunity for all Americans to \nexperience a better way of life. Welfare reform cannot be successful if \nit exacerbates poverty rather than instituting measures to combat it. \nBeing poor is not a sin, and blaming and punishing the poor for the \nsocial ills of this country is a misguided approach. Poverty is not a \ngenetic issue, it is an economic issue. Creating new economic \nopportunities is a critical part, therefore, of any sensible welfare \nreform legislation, and it is the focus of my bill.\n  If the Senate is going to make headway on a proposal that can garner \nbipartisan support, everybody in this body, I think, must acknowledge \nthe facts and not give in to unfounded rhetoric. The current welfare \ndebate must not be framed by misconceptions and prejudices. The real \nproblems that cause bloated welfare rolls, growing poverty, the lack of \njobs in poor communities, the lack of health care and child care, \nshould not get lost in the crossfire.\n  The facts are:\n  First, more AFDC recipients are white than are black.\n  Second, two-thirds of the recipients, 9 million of the total 14.1 \nmillion people, are children.\n  Third, the average family size is 2.9, which is similar to the \nnational family size average.\n  Four, the average national monthly benefit is $373 a month for a \nfamily of three which, of course, is far below the poverty line, the \nofficial designated poverty line of $1,026 per month.\n  Finally, that the bulk of the recipients, over 40 percent, stay on \nwelfare for only 2 years or less.\n  In order to make a dent in the welfare problem, which is really an \neconomic one, I believe we must first create jobs. Even though \nunemployment rates are declining nationally in our Nation's poor \ncommunities, the unemployment numbers are staggering. For example, Mr. \nPresident, in Chicago's Robert Taylor Homes, which is a section on the \nsouth side of the city, there is 1 percent private sector employment--1 \npercent. No wonder that, even in a period of low national unemployment, \nin Chicago in this area 80 percent of the youth between the ages of 16 \nand 19 are unemployed and 55 percent of the 20- to 24-year-olds are out \nof work. Mr. President, this is not only a local problem, this is a \nnational calamity, and it represents the kind of economic meltdown that \nhas given rise to the welfare chaos that we see.\n  In addition to creating jobs, we must also do better to match job \nopportunities to recipients. While some have advocated a public works \nprogram, I believe that we have to build public/private partnerships to \nbuild jobs in the private sector. My bill offers several ways that this \ncan be done.\n  In the first instance, it encourages banks to make equity investments \nin companies that are willing to locate in poor communities. Companies \nreceiving these funds will be required to hire and train welfare \nrecipients.\n  It allows welfare recipients to save money in what are called \nqualified asset accounts so they can start their own businesses and \nbegin to prepare for their future.\n  It provides funding for job support demonstrations to help recipients \nin private sector jobs to maintain them.\n  And it provides funding for one-stop shopping career centers that \ncoordinate services for welfare recipients, including job placement and \njob training.\n  Mr. President, while creating private-sector jobs in some areas may \nbe difficult, and while we may not be able to create enough jobs to \nemploy all welfare recipients immediately, I believe we must take this \nstep. The dearth of private sector jobs is one of the greatest \nunacknowledged truths in this welfare debate. Instead, many have \nfocused on cuts in funding and time limits. Requiring responsibility is \nimportant, but requiring time limits is ludicrous if there are no jobs \nfor the recipients.\n  In addition to job creation, I believe we have to invest in families. \nOur current program has focused on providing subsistence to needy \nfamilies. I believe we have to move from this philosophy to one of \ninvestment in families.\n  We can start, I think, with eliminating marriage disincentives.\n  Further, we have to eliminate barriers to working. It makes no sense \nto reduce benefits to recipients after 4 months and then again after 12 \nmonths, effectively eliminating incentives to work. I believe States do \nneed flexibility to make changes like those permitted in my home State. \nIllinois allows recipients to keep $2 for every $3 of income. This is \nmuch easier administratively and allows recipients to earn money and to \nsupport a household.\n  Also, I believe we also have to encourage the working poor to take \nfull advantage of what is already available to them. Nearly a quarter \nof those eligible for the earned income tax credit did not take \nadvantage of the program. Less than one-half of 1 percent of families \ncollecting EITC used the advanced payment option, which effectively \nfunctions as a negative income tax. I believe we need to do more to \nencourage people to take advantage of the programs that are already in \nplace.\n  Also, Mr. President, we must do more to help those who get off \nwelfare to stay off welfare. The majority of AFDC recipients leave \nwithin 2 years and 50 percent leave within 1 year. The problem is that \na good chunk of those, 50 percent, who receive welfare tend to cycle on \nand off. The principal reason that most women leave their jobs and \nreturn to welfare is the lack of health insurance. A temporary response \nuntil we have real health care reform and, hopefully, universal \ncoverage is to allow States to extend Medicaid health care coverage to \nwomen who want to get off welfare and out of the trap of welfare.\n  Another critical element is the provision of child care. While there \nare child care programs for low-income families, the dollars, frankly, \nare scarce. If we are to move women from welfare to work, we cannot \nforget about the children. Child care must be available and affordable. \nThere is no other way unless we want to encourage child abandonment so \nmoms can go to work to feed them. I believe we should block grant many \nof the child care programs, allowing the States to construct their own \nsystems of funding. At the same time, I believe it is important to \nmaintain the child care guarantee for those receiving assistance and to \nmake certain that the assistance is adequate.\n  What the American people, I believe, wanted and what this Congress \nshould deliver is not a program that throws money at the problem or \nthat pulls the rug out from under the feet of poor children. We must \ndesign a program that makes every dollar productive.\n  In designing reforms, we should not ignore our past experience. We \nhave existing programs that have been successful in moving recipients \nfrom welfare to work.\n  Wisconsin and Riverside, CA have been widely touted as the most \nsuccessful welfare-to-work programs in \n[[Page S6085]] the Nation. What both of these programs have are several \nthings in common: An immediate requirement to find a job or participate \nin job search activities, increased funds for necessary support \nservices like job training, counselors, and child care, and more \ncaseworkers to deal more directly and comprehensively with the needs of \nindividual recipients.\n  Moving recipients into jobs is expensive and time consuming. It can \nbe done, but not on the cheap. Investing in people is more expensive, \nbut far more rewarding, than just giving them a check. My bill costs \nmoney, but I believe it is an investment in the future. As the Chicago \nTribune wrote in a recent editorial ``a society that does not invest \nlong term is one that always will have problems in the short.''\n  I believe the Senate must also pledge to do no harm. We recently \npledged to reject any legislation that increases the number of hungry \nand homeless children. Poorly thought out welfare reform does just \nthat. When Michigan eliminated general assistance, jobs were not \nforthcoming and the number of homeless and hungry people increased. We \nmust learn from past errors, and not enact reforms that ultimately hurt \nmore poor children and families than are helped.\n  My bill, the Economic Opportunity and Family Responsibility Act, \nfocuses on economic opportunity, family investment and transitional \nsupport. I believe these are the components for real welfare reform. I \nalso believe that a greater dialog on these aspects of welfare reform \nshould serve as a base for a wise and realistic Senate welfare reform \neffort.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a summary and a section-\nby-section analysis of its provisions be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n                                Summary\n\n       The Economic Opportunity and Family Responsibility Act of \n     1995 focuses on welfare reform solutions that seek to reduce \n     poverty in America. The key elements follow:\n       Investment in poor communities through private sector job \n     creation; improves work incentives; provides state \n     flexibility; encourages marriage and family stability; \n     encourages parental responsibility; targets teen parents; \n     acknowledges and encourages the participation of the non-\n     custodial parent; reduces recidivism.\n\n\n         1. provides incentives for private sector job creation\n\n       Equity Investment Proposal--Targets the use of the banking \n     system to create equity investments in companies located in \n     or near poor communities. The Federal Reserve would be \n     required to pay interest on the over $30 billion that banks \n     and thrifts have on deposit at the Federal Reserve. Instead \n     of cash interest would be paid in the form of certificates \n     equal in value to the interest each bank and thrift \n     ``earned'' each year.\n       Banks and thrifts could turn the certificates into cash by \n     making investments in qualified companies--qualified \n     companies are those willing to locate in or near high-\n     unemployment/poverty zones. Qualified companies must agree \n     that 50% of their employees associated with the investments \n     will come from the ranks of the unemployed residents of the \n     zone and particularly the long term unemployed and those \n     eligible for AFDC, Foodstamps, and General Assistance.\n       Job Support Demonstration--Demonstration funds are \n     available to entities in poor communities that have developed \n     agreements with the private sector to provide jobs and \n     relevant training to AFDC recipients. Funds could be used for \n     necessary support services.\n       Coordination of Services--Allows funds for several \n     demonstrations for states to develop One-Stop Career Centers \n     in poor communities that would provide information on and/or \n     assist recipients in obtaining job training, education, \n     support services and matching job skills with existing or \n     anticipated jobs.\n\n\n                     2. provides incentives to work\n\n       Increase Income Disregard--Allows states the flexibility to \n     set their own income disregards.\n       Qualified Asset Accounts--States may allow recipients to \n     save up to $10,000 for education, self-employment, and work \n     related expenses.\n       Advanced EITC--Requires the Secretary of the Treasury to \n     develop an Advanced Earned Income Tax Credit demonstration \n     program.\n       Tax Assistance Program--Expands government efforts to \n     provide funds for tax assistance to low income families \n     targeting AFDC, Food Stamp recipients, the homeless, and \n     those families that receive child care assistance through the \n     At-Risk program.\n\n\n                     3. provides state flexibility\n\n       Allows states to move from process and administrative \n     activities to moving recipients into work by:\n       Allowing states to require participation in JOBS \n     immediately.\n       Allowing states the flexibility to determine what \n     activities constitute participation in JOBS and the hours of \n     recipient participation.\n       Consolidating several child care programs into a capped \n     entitlement block grant.\n       Liberalizing earned income disregard rule.\n       Increasing JOBS funds.\n              4. encourages marriage and family stability\n\n       Elimination of Marriage Disincentives:\n       Work histories--Removes the AFDC provision that requires \n     principal wage earners in two parent families to have record \n     work histories.\n       100 hour rule--Removes the AFDC provision that denies \n     eligibility in the wage earner works 100 hours or more in a \n     month.\n       6 month limit--Removes the AFDC provision that allows \n     States to limit the participation of two-parent families in \n     AFDC to only 6 months in any 12 month period.\n       Stepparents--Exempts stepparents from current deeming rules \n     when their income is less than 130 percent of poverty.\n                  5. requires parental responsibility\n\n       Expands Federal Locator Systems--Establishes a national \n     network based on comprehensive statewide child support \n     enforcement systems, allowing states to locate any absent \n     parent who owes child support and coordinating child support \n     enforcement between states.\n       Federal Child Support Order Registry--Establishes a federal \n     child support order registry at HHS.\n       National Child Support Guidelines Commission--Establishes a \n     Commission to develop national child support guidelines for \n     consideration by the Congress.\n       Civil Procedures for Paternity Establishment would be \n     Strengthened--Streamlines civil procedures used to establish \n     paternity.\n       Hold on Occupational, Professional, and Business Licenses--\n     Denies/withholds occupational, professional, business, and \n     drivers' licenses for noncompliance with child support \n     orders.\n\n\n                        6. targets teen parents\n\n       Teen Schooling and Employment Requirements--Requires teen \n     AFDC recipients to participate in educational activities \n     leading to completion of high school or the equivalent, or \n     participate in job preparation and job search activities. For \n     those teens who do not meet these requirements a portion of \n     their AFDC grant will be cut.\n       Teen Case Management--Requires states to establish a system \n     that provides intensive case management services to teen \n     parents on AFDC.\n       Minor Teenage Parent Residency Requirement--Requires teen \n     parents receiving AFDC to live at home with parents or in \n     another supervised setting, except under certain \n     circumstances.\n\n\n          7. acknowledges the role of the non-custodial parent\n\n       Allows states to use a portions of JOBS funds for non-\n     custodial parents:\n       Child Support Demonstrations--Provides funding for state \n     demonstrations to establish programs for non-custodial \n     parents who are unable to pay child support due to under or \n     unemployment.\n       Teen Noncustodial Parents and Child Support--Gives states \n     the authority to temporarily waive the right to collect child \n     support obligations of teen noncustodial parents who are \n     participating in a state educational or employment \n     preparation program.\n       Provides grants to states for access and visitation \n     programs.\n\n\n                         8. reduces recidivism\n\n       Allows states to extend transitional child care and \n     Medicaid:\n       Six child care programs are block granted. The child care \n     guarantee remains for those receiving AFDC and those \n     transitioning off of AFDC. Additional funds are made \n     available for the block grant.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                      Section-by-Section Analysis\n\n\n                             title i--work\n\n     Section 101. Increase in JOBS program funding\n       Increase funding for the JOBS program to: $1.540 billion in \n     FY96, $1.980 billion in FY97, $2.420 billion in FY98, $2.860 \n     billion in FY99, $3.300 billion in FY00.\n     Section 102. Increase in JOBS matching rate; continuation of \n         minimum rate\n       Increase the Federal match rate by 5% in FY96, by 10% by \n     FY2000, with a minimum of 70%.\n       Other Changes: A portion of JOBS funds up to 5% at a \n     state's discretion can be targeted to non-custodial parents.\n     Section 103.

Increased income disregard\n       Liberalizes earned income disregard requirements.\n     Section 202. Disregard of income and resources designated for \n         education, training, and employability\n       Allows AFDC recipients to disregard up to $10,000 of their \n     contributions to ``qualified asset accounts''. Funds could be \n     used for the following:\n       the attendance of any family member at any education or \n     training program;\n       the improvement of the employability (including self-\n     employment) of a member of the family (such as through the \n     purchase of a car);\n       the purchase of a family residence;\n       a change of the family residence.\n     Section 203.

Case management\n       Would require State to assign a case manager to each teen \n     recipient who is a custodial parent or pregnant.\n\n\n TITLE III--STRENGTHENING PARENTAL RESPONSIBILITY AND FAMILY STABILITY\n\n                  Subtitle A--Federal Responsibilities\n\n     Section 301. Expansion of functions of federal parent locator \n         service\n       The functions of the federal parent locator service would \n     be expanded to provide information about an absent parent in \n     order to establish parentage, or establish, modify, and \n     enforce child support obligations. Safeguards would be \n     established to prevent disclosure of information that would \n     jeopardize the safety of either parent, or any child.\n     Section 302. Expansion of federal parent locator systems\n       The information collected by the Locator System would be \n     expanded to include the most recent residential address, \n     employer name and address, and amounts and nature of income \n     and assets. The Secretary of the Treasury would be required \n     to provide access to all Federal income tax returns filed by \n     individuals with the IRS. The Secretary of HHS would expand \n     the Parent Locator Service to establish a national network \n     based on comprehensive statewide child support enforcement \n     systems, which would allow states to locate any absent parent \n     who owes child support, and coordinate child support \n     enforcement between states.\n     Section 303. Federal child support order registry\n       The Secretary of HHS would establish a federal registry \n     containing all child support orders entered in any state. \n     States would use the registry to enforce interstate orders, \n     update support orders, and track old child support orders.\n     Section 304. National reporting of employees and child \n         support information\n       Secretaries of Labor and the Treasury would establish a \n     system of reporting of employees by requiring employers to \n     provide a copy of every employee's W-4 form to the child \n     support order registry. The W-4 would include information \n     about the employee's child support obligations.\n     Section 305. Federal matching payments\n       The Federal Matching Rate would be increased to 69 percent \n     in fiscal year 1996, 72 percent in fiscal year 1997; and 75 \n     percent in fiscal year 1998 and each succeeding fiscal year.\n     Section 306. Performance-based incentives and penalties\n       To encourage and reward State child support enforcement \n     programs which perform in an effective manner, the Federal \n     matching rate for payments to a State would be increased by a \n     factor reflecting the sum of the applicable incentive \n     adjustments with respect to Statewide paternity establishment \n     and to overall performance in child support enforcement. \n     Amounts range from up to 5 percentage points, depending on \n     Statewide paternity establishment; and 10 percentage points \n     in connection with the overall performance in child support \n     enforcement.\n     Section 307. Increased federal financial participation for \n         States with unified child support enforcement programs\n       The quarterly payment would increase by 5 percentage points \n     if the State child support enforcement program is centered at \n     the State level in a unified State agency.\n     Section 308. New child support audit process\n       The Secretary of HHS would generate new criteria and \n     standards for conducting reviews of the child support \n     provisions of the Social Security Act.\n     Section 309. National child support guidelines commission\n       A commission would be established to develop a national \n     child support guideline for consideration by the Congress.\n     Section 310. Child support audit advisory committee\n       A committee of no more than 6 members would be established \n     to assist the Secretary of HHS in developing revised audit \n     criteria and standards.\n\n                  Subtitle B--Paternity Establishment\n\n     Section 311. Paternity establishment procedures\n       Procedure would be established to make the voluntary \n     establishment of paternity easier, including the use of \n     hospital-based acknowledgement. Due process protection would \n     be established for those individuals who voluntarily \n     acknowledge paternity with extra protection for minor \n     noncustodial parents who voluntarily acknowledge paternity.\n     Section 312. Enhancing outreach to encourage paternity \n         establishment\n       Would add an enhanced federal match rate of 90 percent for \n     greater state outreach efforts to encourage voluntary \n     paternity establishment. This outreach could occur through \n     providers of health services, such as prenatal health care \n     providers, health clinics, or hospitals.\n     Section 313. Strengthening civil procedures for paternity \n         establishment\n       Civil procedures used to establish paternity would be \n     streamlined through such activities as expediting procedures \n     for genetic testing upon birth of the child; advance the \n     costs of genetic tests, subject to recoupment from the \n     putative father of a child if he is determined to be the \n     father; prohibit the use of hearings by a court or \n     administrative agency to ratify an acknowledgement of \n     paternity; and allowing the forgiveness of medical expenses\n      associated with the birth of the child if the father \n     cooperates or acknowledges paternity.\n     Section 314. Penalty for failure to established paternity \n         promptly\n       The amounts payable to a State for any quarter after the \n     enactment of this act would be reduced by an amount \n     determined from a formula developed by the Secretary of HHS \n     for certain children for whom paternity has not been \n     established.\n\n                        Subtitle C--Enforcement\n\n     Section 321. Access to financial records\n       Establishes procedures under which the State may obtain \n     access to financial records maintained by any financial \n     institution doing business in the State, for the purpose of \n     establishing, modifying, or enforcing a child support \n     obligation of the person.\n     Section 322. Presumed address of obligor and obligee\n       Procedures under which the court would require each party \n     subject to child support order to file the following: the \n     party's residential address or addresses; the party's mailing \n     address; the party's home telephone numbers; the party's \n     driver's license number and the state that issued that \n     license; the party's social security account number; the name \n     of each employer of the party; the addresses of each place of \n     employment of the party; and the party's work telephone \n     number or numbers.\n     Section 323. Fair credit reporting act amendment\n       Would allow access to credit reports for a State agency for \n     use in establishing, modifying, or enforcing a child support \n     award.\n     [[Page S6087]] Section 324. Additional benefits subject to \n         garnishment\n       Would allow garnishment of Federal death benefits, Black \n     Lung benefits, workers' compensation and veterans benefits to \n     fulfill child support obligations.\n     Section 325. Hold on occupational, professional, and business \n         licenses\n       Procedures under which the State or Federal occupational \n     licensing and regulating departments and agencies may not \n     issue or renew any occupational, professional, or business \n     license of a parent who is the subject of an outstanding \n     failure to appear in a child support proceeding, or an \n     individual who is delinquent in the payment of child support.\n     Section 326. Driver's licenses and vehicle registrations \n         denied to persons failing to appear in child support \n         cases\n       The State would not issue or renew the driver's license of \n     any noncustodial parent who is the subject of an outstanding \n     failure to appear warrant, capias, or bench warrant related \n     to a child support proceeding.\n     Section 327. Liens\n       The State would place liens on all nonexempt real and \n     titled personal property for child support arrearages, \n     updating the value of the lien on a regular basis.\n     Section 328. Fraudulent transfer pursuit\n       Would require agencies to view any transfer of property for \n     significantly less than the market value by a person who owes \n     child support arrearages as an attempt to avoid paying child \n     support arrearages.\n     Section 329. Reporting of child support arrearages to credit \n         bureaus\n       Would require the total amount of the monthly support \n     obligation to be reported to credit bureaus.\n     Section 330. Denial of passports to noncustodial parents \n         subject to State arrest warrants in cases of nonpayment \n         of child support\n       The Secretary of State is authorized to refuse a passport \n     or revoke, restrict, or limit a passport for any person \n     owning child support in any case that is not less than \n     $10,000.\n     Section 331. Statutes of limitations\n       The age through which a State could pursue back child \n     support would be extended until the child to whom the support \n     is owed reaches age 30.\n     Section 332. Collection of past-due support using tax \n         collection authority\n       The role of the IRS would be expanded to include collection \n     of delinquent child support orders.\n\n                   Subtitle D--State Responsibilities\n\n     Section 341. Start role\n       Each State would be required to establish an automated \n     central State registry of child support orders, which, under \n     a phase-in plan, would eventually contain all child support \n     orders entered, modified, or enforced in the State.\n     Section 342. Uniform terms in orders\n       There would be a uniform abstract of a child support order \n     developed, for use by the child support order registry. The \n     uniform order would contain all pertinent information for the \n     registry.\n     Section 343. States required to enact the uniform interstate \n         family support act\n       Each State must have in effect laws which adopt the \n     officially approved version of the Uniform Interstate Family \n     Support Act.\n     Section 344.

A bill to require the President to notify the Congress of \ncertain arms sales to Saudi Arabia until certain outstanding commercial \ndisputes between United States nationals and the Government of Saudi \nArabia are resolved; to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban \nAffairs.\n\n\n          THE SAUDI ARABIAN ARMS SALES LIMITATION ACT OF 1995\n\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, I rise today, on behalf of myself and \nSenator Moynihan, to introduce the Saudi Arabian Arms Sales Limitation \nAct of 1995. This legislation is designed to rectify a wrong that has \nbeen placed on an American company with New York roots by the \nGovernment of Saudi Arabia.\n  Specifically, this legislation would modify section 36(b)(1) of the \nArms Export and Control Act to require congressional oversight and \nscrutiny of all arms sales to the Government of the Kingdom of Saudi \nArabia until such time as the Secretary of State certifies and reports \nto Congress that the unpaid claims of American companies described in \nthe June 30, 1993 report by the Secretary of Defense pursuant to \nsection 9140(c) of the Department of Defense Appropriation Act, 1993--\nPublic Law 102-396; 106 Stat. 1939--have been resolved satisfactorily. \nThis would also include the additional claims noticed by the Department \nof Commerce on page 2 of the report.\n  The claim of a New York company, Gibbs & Hill, Inc., falls under this \nlegislation. The company, which was a large employer in New York, \nsought to have its claim paid through the special claims process \nestablished for the resolution of claims of American companies which \nhad not received fair treatment in their commercial dealing with the \nGovernment of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. The Gibbs & Hill claim is \nthe last remaining unpaid claim awaiting resolution under the special \nclaims process. Gibbs & Hill was decimated by financial losses incurred \nin the design of the desalination and related facilities for the Yanbu \nindustrial city in Saudi Arabia in the late 1970's and early 1980's as \na result of the kingdom's failure to honor its contractual obligations \nand pay for work done for the company.\n  Myself and many of my colleagues wrote to Saudi Ambassador, Bandar \nbin Sultan, who has authority to pay the claim, to express my concern \nthat\n outstanding United States commercial claims be successfully resolved. \nIn particular, I stated my concern that American companies may learn of \nthe difficulties faced by United States firms in their efforts to \nachieve just settlements of their disputes and may become reluctant to \ndo business in Saudi Arabia thereby depriving both countries of a \nvaluable form of business exchange.\n\n  Now, we have the opportunity to conclude the special claims process \nestablished in 1992 for the resolution of claims of American companies \nfor work in the kingdom. The kingdom has made a series of commitments \nto our Government to favorably resolve the claim for Gibbs & Hill. \nThese commitments date from April 1993 and were reiterated both in \nWashington and in Riyadh on the eve of the gulf crisis, October 7, \n1994, when our Nation once again come to the kingdom's rescue. While we \nsaved the kingdom's assets once again, Gibbs & Hill has yet to be paid.\n  Administration officials, and numerous Senators and Members of \nCongress have repeatedly expressed their concern that this claims issue \nbe successfully concluded through payment to Gibbs & Hill. The delaying \ntactics of the kingdom, which stands in stark contrast to our immediate \nresponse to their needs, can no longer be tolerated. Further delay \nsimply casts a shadow over our bilateral relationship that eclipses the \ngood-faith efforts which we have exerted together on the claims issue \nand indeed on all issues.\n  I urge my colleagues in the Congress to support this legislation. I \nalso hope that the ensuing discussion of this legislation will focus on \nadditional measures to ensure that the unfair treatment of Gibbs & Hill \nin its commercial dealings with the Saudi Arabian Government during the \ncourse of performing its work on behalf of the Saudi Arabian \nGovernment, as well as under the special claims process, is not \nrepeated. It is with the realization of the past unfair treatment of \nfirms such as Gibbs & Hill that I offer this legislation in an effort \nto fully scrutinize our commercial dealings with the kingdom until such \ntime as the kingdom demonstrates its intention to honor its obligations \nand commitments.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 747\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. NOTIFICATION OF ARMS SALES.\n\n       Until the certification under section 2 is submitted to the \n     Congress, section 36(b)(1) of the Arms Export Control Act \n     shall be applied to sales to Saudi Arabia by substituting in \n     [[Page S6089]] the first sentence ``$10,000,000'' for \n     ``$50,000,000'', ``$50,000,000'' for ``$200,000,000'', and \n     ``$2,000,000'' for ``$14,000,000''.\n\n     SEC. 2. CERTIFICATION.\n\n       Section 1 shall cease to apply if, and when the Secretary \n     of State certifies and reports in writing to the Congress \n     that the unpaid claims of American firms against the \n     Government of Saudi Arabia that are described in the June 30, \n     1993, report by the Secretary of Defense pursuant to section \n     9140(c) of the Department of Defense Appropriations Act, 1993 \n     (Public Law 102-896; 106 Stat 1939), including the additional \n     claims noticed by the Department of Commerce on page 2 of \n     that report, have been resolved satisfactorily.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. McCAIN:\n  S. 748. A bill to require industry cost-sharing for the construction \nof certain new federally funded research facilities, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Governmental Affairs.\n\n\n         THE FEDERAL RESEARCH FINANCING IMPROVEMENT ACT OF 1995\n\n Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, today I'm introducing legislation \nto restore fairness and fiscal accountability to the Federal \nGovernment's many research and development programs and activities.\n  The bill would require that commercial interests share the cost of \nconstructing and operating new Federal research facilities that are \nintended to benefit their industries.\n  This year the Federal Government will spend $73 billion for research \nprograms, including facility construction. Many of these programs are \nintended primarily to assist private industries and are sponsored by a \nhost of Federal agencies, predominantly the Department of Agriculture, \nthe Department of Commerce, and the National Research Council.\n  For example, the Department of Agriculture spends nearly $750 billion \nper year for 116 centers under the Agriculture Research Service. These \nfederally funded centers are designed to help a variety of agriculture \nindustries, many of which have enormous resources and do not require \nFederal assistance. I understand the agency is planning to construct \neven more facilities. Last year, Congress appropriated $26 million to \nconstruct a new swine research center at Iowa State University, even \nthough we already have 12 Federal centers dedicated to swine research. \nThis additional facility will cost nearly $10 million a year to \noperate.\n  Mr. President, I recognize the importance of research and development \nto our competitiveness and economic growth, although I seriously \nquestion why we need 13 centers dedicated to swine research. \nNevertheless, given our serious fiscal condition at a time when we are \ncontemplating significant reductions in practically every area of \ndomestic discretionary spending, I see absolutely no reason why \nGovernment research that benefits private industries, many of them \nquite prosperous, should not be cost-shared by the private sector.\n  In regard to the Swine Research Center, the pork industry, generates \nnearly $66 billion per year. Surely, it is reasonable to expect the \nindustry, and the many others that directly benefit from Federal \nresearch, to share the cost of that work. I should add that the \nlegislation would not require cost sharing for any research conducted \nfor the purpose of helping industry comply with Federal regulations.\n  Mr. President, industry is historically more cautious with their \nresources than the Federal Government. If the private sector will not \nexpend their resources for a program that is intended for their \nbenefit, one must question why we would feel compelled to spend the \ntaxpayer's hard earned money on the same venture. Public-private cost-\nsharing arrangements for commercially oriented Federal research will \nensure that proposed activities are truly cost-beneficial and that the \npotential outcomes of the research are worth the dollars invested.\n  Again, I realize and appreciate the importance of research and \ndevelopment. Certainly, activities intended to promote public health \nand safety should not be compromised. I believe, however, that the \nlegislation I've introduced is a prudent and responsible approach \nwhich, no doubt, can be improved, but which should receive the Senate's \nfull and timely consideration. I hope that we can have a hearing in the \nvery near future to examine what I believe is a very important fiscal \nissue.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. AKAKA (for himself and Mr. Rockefeller):\n  S. 749. A bill to amend title 38, United States Code, to recise the \nauthority relating to the Center for Women Veterans of the Department \nof Veterans Affairs, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nVeterans' Affairs.\n\n\n  THE TECHNICAL MODIFICATIONS TO MINORITY VETERANS INITIATIVES ACT OF \n                                  1995\n\n Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, in behalf of myself and Senator \nRockefeller, I am offering legislation today that would make certain \nimprovements, largely technical in nature, to provisions affecting \nminority and women veterans that were enacted as part of an omnibus \nveterans benefits measure (Public Law 103-446) late last year.\n  As my colleagues recall, among other initiatives, Public Law 103-446 \nestablished within the Department of Veterans Affairs [VA] a Center for \nMinority Veterans, a Center for Women Veterans, and an Advisory \nCommittee on Minority Veterans. These provisions were adopted in order \nto ensure that VA appropriately addresses the special needs and \nconcerns of veterans who are women or members of minority groups. The \nmeasure we are introducing today would make the following modifications \nto these initiatives:\n  First, it would allow the directors of the Center for Minority \nVeterans and the Center for Women Veterans to have either career or \nnoncareer status. Under the legislation adopted last year, both \ndirectors are required to be noncareer appointees. As the Senate \nsponsor of the legislation that led to the establishment of the two \nCenters, I had wanted the Secretary to retain the discretion to appoint \neither career or noncareer individuals to these jobs and believed that \nthere was agreement on this approach with our colleagues in the House. \nUnfortunately, the career alternative was not included in the final \nlegislation. The provision in the bill we are introducing today would \nrestore that option so that the Secretary will have the option to \nappoint directors with career status so as to be able to consider the \nwidest possible field of qualified candidates.\n  Second, it would add an additional function to the list of statutory \nfunctions of the Center for Minority Veterans. Specifically, our \nlegislation would require the center to advise the Secretary of the \neffectiveness of VA's efforts to include minority groups in clinical \nresearch and on the particular health conditions affecting the health \nof minority group members. This provision is consistent with the goals \nset forth in section 492B of the Public Health Service Act. The Center \nfor Women Veterans is already mandated by law to carry out a similar \nfunction with respect to the health of women veterans.\n  Third, it would explicitly require that the Center for Minority \nVeterans provide support and administrative services to the Advisory \nCommittee on Minority Veterans. This provision is consistent with the \ntraditional agency role of providing\n professional and technical support to advisory entities. Again, this \nprovision parallels existing law requiring that the Center for Women \nVeterans provide support to the Advisory Committee on Women Veterans.\n  Fourth, it would define the minority veterans for whom the Center for \nMinority Veterans has responsibility. Specifically, minority veterans \nare defined as individuals who are Asian-American, black, Hispanic, \nNative American--including American Indian, Alaskan native, and Native \nHawaiian--and Pacific-Islander-American. This definition is identical \nto the definition included in current law with respect to the Advisory \nCommittee on Minority Veterans.\n  Fifth, it would extend the termination date of the Advisory Committee \non Minority Veterans an additional 2 years, from December 31, 1997, to \nDecember 31, 1999. This provision is necessary because delays in \nestablishing the Advisory Committee have reduced its potential working \nlife to significantly less than the 3 years authorized by Congress. \nExtending the life of the Advisory Committee to December 1999 is not \nunreasonable, given that all other statutory VA advisory boards, \nincluding the Advisory Committee on Women Veterans, the Advisory \nCommittee on Former Prisoners of War, \n[[Page S6090]] and the Advisory Committee on Prosthetics and Special-\nDisabilities Programs, are authorized permanently.\n  Finally, our bill would give the Advisory Committee on Minority \nVeterans and the Advisory Committee on Women Veterans responsibility \nfor monitoring and evaluating the respective activities of the Center \nfor Minority Veterans and the Center for Women Veterans. Insofar as the \nAdvisory Committees were established to oversee all of the activities \nof the Department of Veterans Affairs with respect to minorities and \nwomen, they necessarily should be tasked with overseeing the work of \nthe very offices that are chiefly responsible for ensuring that the \nspecial needs of minority and female veterans are accommodated by VA.\n  Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to support this measure.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the full text of the bill be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n                                 S. 749\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to properly \ncharacterize certain redemptions of stock held by corporations; to the \nCommittee on Finance.\n\n\n                    redemption of stocks legislation\n\n Mr. PACKWOOD. Mr. President, recent news reports suggest that \ncorporate taxpayers may be attempting to dispose of stock of other \ncorporations through stock redemption transactions that are the \neconomic equivalent of sales. The transactions are structured so that \nthe redeemed corporate shareholder apparently expects to take the \nposition that the transaction qualifies for the corporate dividends \nreceived deduction and therefore substantially avoids the payment of \nfull tax on the gain that would apply to a sales transaction.\n  For example, it has been reported that Seagram Co. intends to take \nthe position that the corporate dividends received deduction will \neliminate tax on significant distributions received from DuPont Co. in \na redemption of almost all the DuPont stock held by Seagram, coupled \nwith the issuance of certain rights to reacquire DuPont stock. (See, \ne.g. Landro and Shapiro, Hollywood Shuffle, Wall Street Journal, April \n7, 1995; Sloan, For Seagram and DuPont, a Tax Deal that No One Wants to \nBrandy About, Washington Post, April 11, 1995; Sheppard, Can Seagram \nBail Out of DuPont without Capital Gain Tax, Tax Notes Today, 95 TNT \n75-4, April 10, 1995.) Moreover, it is reported that investment bankers \nand other advisors are actively marketing this potential transaction.\n  Today we introduce legislation intended to curtail the use of such \ntransactions immediately. We believe the approach adopted in the bill \nis the correct approach, given the incentives under present law for \ncorporations to structure transactions in an attempt to obtain the \nbenefits of the dividends received deduction. We welcome comments on \nthe bill and recognize that additional or alternative legislative \nchanges may also be appropriate. However, it is anticipated that any \nlegislative change that is enacted would apply to transactions after \nMay 3, 1995.\n  No inference is intended that any transaction of the type described \nin the proposed legislation would in fact produce the results \napparently sought by the taxpayers under present law. The bill does not \naddress and does not modify present law regarding whether a transaction \nwould otherwise be eligible for the dividends received deduction, nor \nis it intended to restrict the IRS or Treasury Department from issuing \nguidance regarding these or other issues.\n  The bill is directed at corporate shareholders because it is believed \nthat the existence of the dividends received deduction under present \nlaw creates incentives for corporate taxpayers to report transactions \nselectively as dividends or sales. No\n inference is intended that any transaction characterized as a sale \nunder the bill necessarily would be so characterized if the shareholder \nwere an individual.\n\n\n                        Description of the Bill\n\n  Under the bill, except as provided in regulations, any non pro rata \nredemption or partial liquidation distribution to a corporate \nshareholder that is otherwise eligible for the dividends received \ndeduction under section 243, 244, or 245 of the Code would be treated \nas a sale of the stock redeemed. The bill applies to dividends to 80-\npercent shareholders that would qualify for the 100-percent dividends \nreceived deduction as well as to other transactions qualifying for a \nlesser dividends received deduction. It is not intended to apply to \ndividends that are eliminated between members of affiliated groups \nfiling consolidated returns. However, it is expected that the Treasury \nDepartment will consider whether any changes to the consolidated return \nregulations would be necessary to prevent avoidance of the purposes of \nthe bill.\n  The bill would replace the present-law provision (sec. 1059(e)(1)) \nthat requires a corporate shareholder to reduce basis--but not \nrecognize immediate gain--in the case of certain non pro rata \nredemptions or partial liquidation distributions.\n  It is intended that the bill apply to all non pro rata redemptions \nexcept to the extent provided by regulations.\n  The bill retains the existing Treasury Department regulatory \nauthority, contained in section 1059(g) of present law, to issue \nregulations, including regulations that provide for the application of \nthe provision in the case of stock dividends, stock splits, \nreorganizations, and other similar transactions and in the case of \nstock held by pass through entities. Thus, the Treasury Department can \nissue regulations to \n[[Page S6091]] carry out the purposes or prevent the avoidance of the \nbill.\n  It is expected that recapitalizations or other transactions that \ncould accomplish results similar to any non pro rata redemption or \npartial liquidation will also be subject to the provisions of the bill \nas appropriate.\n  It is also expected that redemptions of shares held by a partnership \nwill be subject to the provision to the extent there are corporate \npartners.\n  There are concerns that taxpayers might seek to structure \ntransactions to take advantage of sale treatment and inappropriately \nrecognize losses. It is expected that the Treasury Department will by \nregulations address these and other concerns, including by denying \nlosses in appropriate cases or providing rules for the allocation of \nbasis.\n  It is anticipated that the private tax bar and other tax experts will \nprovide input concerning the proposed legislation before its enactment. \nIt is hoped that this process will identify any problems with the \nproposed legislation and potential improvements. Comment is encouraged \nin particular with respect to the loss disallowance provision, \nincluding whether the loss disallowance should be mandatory. Comment is \nalso encouraged as to whether additional transition should be provided \nfor existing rights to redeem contained in the terms of outstanding \nstock or otherwise.\n\n\n                             Effective Date\n\n  The bill would be effective for redemptions occurring after May 3, \n1995, unless pursuant to the terms of a written binding contract in \neffect on May 3, 1995 or pursuant to the terms of a tender offer \noutstanding on May 3, 1995.\n  No inference is intended regarding the tax treatment of any \ntransaction within the scope of the bill. For example, no inference is \nintended that any transaction within the scope of the bill would \notherwise be treated as a sale or exchange under the provisions of \npresent law. At the same time, no inference is intended that any \ndistribution to an individual shareholder that would be within the \nscope of the bill if made to a corporation should be treated as a sale \nor exchange to that individual because of the existence of the \nbill.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. EXON:\n  S. 751. A bill to provide that certain games of chance conducted by a \nnonprofit organization not be treated as an unrelated business of such \norganization; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n                            tax legislation\n\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation to repeal \nan obscurely worded provision in the 1986 Tax Reform Act which makes \nfundraising proceeds from games of chance conducted by nonprofit \norganizations subject to the unrelated business income tax [UBIT]. The \n1986 change was effective for all States except North Dakota, which \nreceived a special exception from the rule. The effect of the change is \nthat nonprofit groups must pay taxes on these proceeds at the corporate \nincome tax rate.\n  In Nebraska, various churches, charities, veterans groups, and other \nnonprofit organizations use pull tab lottery cards for fundraising. \nLocally, these cards are known as pickle cards because they were often \nheld for sale in old, large pickle jars. Pickle card fundraising in \nNebraska is limited under State law only to nonprofit organizations. \nThe problem with the 1986 change was that it was so obscure that many \nnonprofit groups had no knowledge of the new requirement to pay the \nadded tax until 1990. Most, if not all, of the Nebraska nonprofit \norganizations conducting games of chance had a rude awakening when the \nInternal Revenue Service informed them of the back taxes they owed \nalong with interest and penalties.\n  Most of these nonprofit groups are relatively small and they spend \nthe funds raised by gaming each year. You can imagine their shock when \nthey learned that they owed in some cases tens of thousands of dollars \nfor a tax that they did not realize must be paid. In addition to the \nstrain this puts on their finances, the IRS is now challenging\n the not-for-profits status of at least one Nebraska group based on the \namount of funds raised through charitable gaming. Over 200 Nebraska \ncharities have been affected by this confusing change in our law and my \ninconsistent enforcement by the IRS. I know that this has also been a \nproblem in the past in other States, including Maryland and Minnesota.\n\n  The funds that these nonprofit organizations raise are used to \nsupport charitable causes and community services. The intention of the \nunrelated business income tax, enacted in 1950, is to eliminate the \ncompetitive advantage of certain tax-exempt organizations that engage \nin business in direct competition with taxable entities. In Nebraska, \nthese nonprofits are not competing with private companies because, by \nNebraska statute, only nonprofit organizations can raise money by \nselling pickle cards. I believe the solution to this problem is to \neliminate the 1986 change, as the bill I am introducing today would do. \nThis legislation would restore fairness and sensibility to our Tax Code \nand help to ensure that nonprofit organizations are able to continue to \nprovide essential services and support in our communities.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. SIMON (for himself and Ms. Moseley-Braun):\n  S. 752. A bill to amend the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United \nStates to restore the duty rate that prevailed under the tariff \nschedules of the United States for certain twine, cordage, ropes, and \ncables; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n                           Tariff legislation\n\n  Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, today I introduce legislation to correct an \nerror that was made in the 1988 Harmonized Tariff Schedule [HTSUS].\n  Uni-Pac Equipment, Inc., of Bridgeview, IL, has served as the U.S. \ndistributor of a Swiss company, Peter Born, since 1983. Born \nmanufactures a sophisticated machine for tying the top layers of \nproducts stacked pallets. The Born palletyer requires a highly \nspecialized twine with a high tensile strength in order to operate \neffectively.\n  Since 1984, Uni-Pac has been importing the twine used in these \nmachines at a duty rate of 8 percent under tariff 316.5500 [TSUSA]. \nWhen the 1988 Harmonized Tariff Schedule came into effect an error was \ndiscovered. Due to an oversight by someone at the International Trade \nCommission when writing the language of the HTSUS, the tariff covering \nthe twine that Uni-Pac imports was accidentally omitted. This was a \nmistake. The HTSUS was not supposed to change any prevailing duties \nwhen it became law. However, because of the omission, the twine \nimported by Uni-Pac was bumped to the other classification with a duty \nrate of 27.6 cents per kilogram and a 15 percent duty, a 300-percent \nincrease over the previous tariff. This mistake will cost Uni-Pac over \n$100,000 in increased duties if it is not corrected.\n  Uni-Pac has sought several remedies to this problem. The \nInternational Trade Commission does not have the authority to fix it. \nThey have looked for other domestic suppliers of this twine, to no \navail. There are no U.S. manufacturers of any twine that will work in \ntheir machines, and the twine used in these machines is not used in any \nother machine sold in the United States.\n  The only way to fix this problem is to amend the 1988 Harmonized \nTariff Schedule to include a classification for the twine imported by \nUni-Pac and restore the duty rate that had previously been in effect. \nThis new classification is limited in its scope so that it only covers \nthe twine imported by Uni-Pac for use in the Born palletyer. This \nlegislation also liquidates the increased duties that resulted from the \nomission of this classification in the 1988 HTSUS.\n  I am indebted to my colleague in the House, Mr. Lipinski, for his \nwork on this issue. This is not a controversial issue, so I am hopeful \nthat we can move quickly to address this problem.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of this legislation be printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 752\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to allow the collection and payment of funds following \nthe completion of cooperative work involving the protection, \nmanagement, and improvement of the National Forest System, and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and \nForestry.\n\n\n                national forest system land legislation\n\n Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation \nwith Senators Leahy, Lugar, Daschle, Craig, Hatfield, Burns, and \nCampbell. This bipartisan bill encourages public-private partnerships \nin the management of our national forests.\n  National forests provide some of our Nation's most valued resources--\nfish and wildlife species and habitat, rare plants, majestic trees, \nrecreation, and outstanding scenery. The U.S. Forest Service is the \nagency charged with the task of managing and protecting these precious \nresources. But it can't do the job alone. Much of the work carried out \non our national forests is done in partnership with nonprofit \norganizations.\n  The Forest Service works with hundreds of nonprofit groups, including \nthe Nature Conservancy, Rocky Mountain Elk Foundation, Boy Scouts of \nAmerica, and Trout Unlimited. In Montana, for example, the Rocky \nMountain Elk Foundation helped improve habitat for elk, mule deer and \nsensitive bird species on the Lolo National Forest. These groups \ncontribute millions of dollars and countless hours every year to \nimprove our public lands. I think it is time that the U.S. Government \nrecognized their importance and made the rules fairer.\n  That is why I'm introducing this legislation. This bill will make it \neasier for nonprofit groups to make donations for fish and wildlife \nprojects on the national forests. Unlike commercial enterprises that \npay for resources on the national forests after they use them, \nnonprofit organizations make their full contribution up front. This \nrequirement puts these groups at a tremendous disadvantage by causing \nthem to forego interest from the time a cost-share agreement is \nfinalized to when work is finished--a process that frequently takes \nmore than 2 years.\n  My legislation levels the playing field for these private partners. \nIt authorizes the Forest Service to fund cooperative projects with \nappropriated money and lets cooperators reimburse the Forest Service as \nwork is completed rather than having to make their full share in \ncontributions by front. My bill also requires the Secretary of \nAgriculture to establish rules regarding the acceptance of \ncontributions.\n  Everyone wins under this legislation. The Forest Service will \ncomplete more fish and wildlife projects. Nonprofit groups will have a \ngreater incentive to participate in cost-share projects. And, most \nimportantly, the American people will see the benefits of improved fish \nand wildlife habitat. In closing, I encourage Congress to act quickly \non this bill so we can begin to see on-the-ground results.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. KENNEDY (for himself, Mr. Simon, and Mrs. Boxer):\n  S. 754. A bill to amend the Immigration and Nationality Act to more \neffectively prevent illegal immigration by improving control over the \nland borders of the United States, preventing illegal employment of \naliens, reducing procedural wiretap and asset forfeiture authority to \ncombat alien smuggling and related crimes, increasing penalties for \nbringing aliens unlawfully into the United States, and making certain \nmiscellaneous and technical amendments, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on the Judiciary.\n\n\n                IMMIGRATION ENFORCEMENT IMPROVEMENTS ACT\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, it is a privilege to introduce the \nImmigration Enforcement Improvements Act of 1995 today on behalf of the \nClinton administration.\n  This important bill builds upon the administration's already \nimpressive record in addressing the pressing national problem of \nillegal immigration.\n  We must take strong steps to stop illegal immigration, while \ncontinuing to welcome those immigrants who enter lawfully within our \nimmigration ceilings and contribute so much to the Nation.\n  This administration has done more to close the door on illegal \nimmigration than any previous administration. With expected increases \nthis year and next, we will have increased border control staffing by \n51 percent since President Clinton took office--including border \npatrols and inspectors at border crossing points and airports. We have \ntripled the deportation of illegal immigrants and targeted the removal \nof criminal aliens. We have increased the budget of the Immigration \nService by over 70 percent from $1.5 billion in 1993 to $2.6 billion \nrequested for 1996.\n  The real credit for these impressive accomplishments goes to \nPresident Clinton, Attorney General Janet Reno, and Immigration\n Commissioner Doris Meissner for their effective leadership and \ncommitment to meeting the challenge of illegal immigration.\n\n  The legislation introduced today recognizes that there is no single \nsolution to illegal immigration. The bill will give the administration \na variety of tools to control our borders more effectively, to deny \njobs to illegal workers, and to remove illegal immigrants who are here \nin violation of our laws.\n  The bill authorizes increases in enforcement personnel of no less \nthan 700 Border Patrol agents annually for the next 3 years, and \nauthorizes the increases in INS inspectors needed to enable full \nstaffing at airports and entry points.\n  The bill imposes new, stiff penalties for alien smuggling, document \nfraud and other serious immigration offenses.\n  The bill authorizes pilot programs to test effective ways to verify \nthat job applicants are eligible to work in the United States. The goal \nis to find simple and effective ways of denying jobs to illegal \nimmigrants, and thereby shutting down the magnet that draws so many \nillegal aliens to this country.\n  The bill promotes coordination on workplace enforcement between the \nImmigration Service and the Department of Labor, since employers who \nhire undocumented workers often also violate other labor standards as \nwell.\n  Finally, the bill expedites the removal of criminal aliens by \neliminating needless procedures and redtape.\n  [[Page S6093]] I commend the administration for their impressive \ninitiative. Immigration should not be a partisan issue. In the weeks \nahead, I look forward to working closely with Senator Simpson, the \nchairman of the Judiciary Subcommittee on Immigration, and with many \nother colleagues on both sides of the aisle to bring bipartisan \nlegislation before the Senate capable of dealing with the serious \nchallenges we face.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a more detailed summary of the bill may \nbe printed in the Record, along with the text of the bill itself.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n                                 S. 754\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

The Attorney General \n     shall by regulation establish a procedure for special orders \n     of exclusion and deportation under this subsection when, in \n     the case of an alien who is, or aliens who are excludable \n     under section 212(a)--\n       ``(A) The Attorney General determines that the numbers or \n     circumstances of aliens en route to or arriving in the United \n     States, including by aircraft, present an extraordinary \n     migration situation; or\n       ``(B) The alien--\n       [[Page S6094]] ``(i) is brought or escorted under the \n     authority of the United States into the United States, having \n     been on board a vessel encountered outside of the territorial \n     waters of the United States by officers of the United States;\n       ``(ii) is brought or escorted under the authority of the \n     United States to a port of entry, having been on board a \n     vessel encountered within the territorial sea or internal \n     waters of the United States; or\n       ``(iii) has arrived on a vessel transporting aliens to the \n     United States without such alien having received prior \n     official authorization to come to, enter, or reside in the \n     United States.\n\n     ``The judgment whether there exists an extraordinary \n     migration situation within the meaning of (A) or whether to \n     invoke the provisions of (B) is committed to the sole and \n     exclusive discretion of the Attorney General; provided, that \n     the provisions of this subsection may be invoked by the \n     Attorney General under subparagraph (A) for a period not to \n     exceed ninety days, unless, within such ninety-day period or \n     extension thereof, the Attorney General determines, after \n     consultation with the Committees on the Judiciary of the \n     Senate and the House of Representatives, that an \n     extraordinary migration situation continues to warrant such \n     procedures remaining in place for an additional ninety-day \n     period.\n       ``(2) As used in this section, `extraordinary migration \n     situation' means the arrival or imminent arrival in the \n     United States or its territorial waters of aliens who by \n     their numbers or circumstances substantially exceed the \n     capacity for the inspection and examination of such aliens.\n       ``(3) When the Attorney General determines to invoke the \n     provisions of paragraph (1), the Attorney General may, \n     pursuant to this section and sections 235(e) and 106(f), \n     suspend the normal operation of immigration regulations \n     regarding the inspection and exclusion of aliens.\n       ``(4) No alien may be ordered specially excluded under \n     paragraph (1) if: (A) such alien is eligible to seek and \n     seeks asylum under section 208; and (B) the Attorney General \n     determines such alien has a credible fear of persecution on \n     account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a \n     particular social group, or political opinion, in the country \n     of such person's nationality, or in the case of a person \n     having no nationality, the country in which such person last \n     habitually resided.

The pilot projects tested \n     may include: (1) an expansion of the telephone verification \n     system to include, by the end of Fiscal Year 1996, \n     participation by up to 1,000 employers; (2) a process which \n     allows employers to verify the eligibility for employment of \n     new employees using Social Security Administration (SSA) \n     records and, if necessary, to conduct a cross-check using \n     Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) records; (3) a \n     simulated linkage of the electronic records of the INS and \n     the SSA to test the technical feasibility of establishing a \n     linkage between the actual electronic records of the INS and \n     the SSA; or \n     [[Page S6095]] (4) improvements and additions to the \n     electronic records of the INS and the SSA for the purpose of \n     using such records for verification of employment \n     eligibility.\n       (b) The pilot projects referred to in subsection (a) shall \n     be conducted in such locations and with such number of \n     employers as is consistent with their pilot status.\n       (c) The pilot projects referred to in subsection (a) shall \n     begin not later than 12 months after the enactment of this \n     Act and may continue for a period of 3 years. During the \n     pilot project, the Attorney General shall track complaints of \n     discrimination arising from the administration or enforcement \n     of the pilot project.

GRANTS TO STATES FOR MEDICAL ASSISTANCE TO \n                   UNDOCUMENTED IMMIGRANTS.\n\n       (a) In General.--In order to assist States to meet the \n     costs of providing treatment to certain aliens for emergency \n     medical conditions, there are authorized to be appropriated \n     $150,000,000 for each of fiscal years 1996 through 2000.\n       (b) Allotments.--\n       (1) From the sums appropriated pursuant to subsection (a) \n     for a fiscal year, the Secretary of Health and Human Services \n     shall determine, with respect to each State with a plan \n     approved under title XIX of the Social Security Act, an \n     allotment for each such State which shall be the amount which \n     bears the same ratio to the amount appropriated for such \n     fiscal year as the sum of such State's allotments for fiscal \n     years 1988 through 1994 under section 204 of the Immigration \n     Reform and Control Act of 1986 bears to the total of such \n     allotments for all the States for such fiscal years.\n       (2) In the case of any State for which the allotment \n     determined under paragraph (1) for fiscal year is less than 1 \n     percent of the amount appropriated pursuant to subsection (a) \n     for such year, no allotment shall be made, and in the case of \n     any other State which notifies the Secretary that all or part \n     of its allotment will not be needed for the purpose for which \n     it is available, the State's allotment shall be made as \n     determined under paragraph (1), and then reduced by the \n     unneeded portion. There shall be allotted to each of the \n     remaining States the amount determined with respect to each \n     such State under paragraph (1), together with the additional \n     allotments provided below in this paragraph. The total of (A) \n     the amounts of allotments determined under paragraph (1) but \n     not made, and (B) the amount of the reductions under the \n     preceding sentence, shall also be allotted among each of the \n     remaining States as follows: the allotment of each such \n     remaining State shall be increased by an amount which bears \n     the same ratio to such total as the allotment amount \n     determined with respect to such State for the fiscal year \n     involved under paragraph (1) bears to the sum of such \n     allotment amounts for all such remaining States for such \n     fiscal year.\n       (c) Use of Funds.--Payments under this section may only be \n     used to provide the non-Federal share of expenditures under \n     the State plan approved under title XIX of the Social \n     Security Act (as required by the last sentence of section \n     1902(a) of such Act) for care and services necessary for the \n     treatment of an emergency condition that are furnished to an \n     alien who is not a qualified alien under section 250A(c) of \n     the Immigration and Nationality Act.\n       (d) Payment of Funds.--In order to receive funds under this \n     section, the State shall certify to the Secretary that funds \n     will only be used for the purpose described in subsection \n     (c). Thereafter, the Secretary shall from time to time make \n     payments to each State from its allotment under subsection \n     (b)(2). Payments under this section shall be made to the \n     agency responsible for administering or supervising the \n     administration of the State's plan approved under title XIX \n     of the Social Security Act, and such payments shall be \n     available to the State for expenditure in accordance with \n     this section in the year allotted or in any subsequent fiscal \n     year.\n       (e) Definition.--As used in this section, the term \n     ``State'' has the meaning given such term, for purposes of \n     title XIX of the Social Security Act, under section \n     1101(a)(1) of such Act.\n\n     SEC. 603. TECHNICAL CORRECTIONS TO VIOLENT CRIME CONTROL ACT \n                   AND TECHNICAL CORRECTIONS ACT.\n\n       (a)(1) Section 130003(c)(1) of the Violent Crime Control \n     Act of 1994, Pub. L. 103-322, is amended by striking ``a new \n     subsection (i)'' and inserting ``a new subsection (j)''.\n       (2) The amendment made by this subsection shall be \n     effective as if originally included in section 130003(c)(1) \n     of the Violent Crime Control Act of 1994.\n       (b)(1) Section 106(d)(1)(D) of the Immigration and \n     Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1105a), as amended by Section \n     130004(b) of the Violent Crime Control Act of 1994, Pub. L. \n     103-322, is amended by striking ``242A(b)(5)'' and inserting \n     ``242A(b)(4)''.\n       (2) The amendment made by this subsection shall be \n     effective as if originally included in section 130004(b) of \n     the Violent Crime Control Act of 1994.\n       (c)(1) Section 242A(d)(4) of the Immigration and \n     Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1252a(d)(4)), as added by section \n     223 of the Immigration and Nationality Technical Corrections \n     Act of 1994, Pub. L. 103-416, is amended by striking \n     ``without a decision on the merits''.\n       (2) The amendment made by this subsection shall be \n     effective as if originally included in section 223 of Pub. L. \n     103-416.\n\n     SEC. 604. EXPEDITIOUS DEPORTATION.\n\n       Section 225 of the Immigration and Nationality Technical \n     Corrections Act of 1994, Pub. L. 103-416, is amended by \n     striking the words ``section 242(i) of the Immigration and \n     Nationality Act (8 U.S.C 1252(i))'' and substituting in lieu \n     thereof, ``sections 242(i) or 242A of the Immigration and \n     Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1252(i) or 1252a)''.\n\n     SEC. 605. AUTHRORIZATION FOR USE OF VOLUNTEERS.\n\n       Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the Attorney \n     General may accept, administer, and utilize gifts of services \n     from any person for the purpose of providing administrative \n     assistance to the Immigration and Naturalization Service in \n     administering programs relating to naturalization, \n     adjudications at ports of entry, and removal of criminal \n     aliens. Nothing in this Section shall require the Attorney \n     General to accept the services of any person.\n                                                                    ____\n\n  Section-by-Section Analysis as Prepared by the Department of Justice\n\n\n                      Title I--Border Enforcement\n\n       Sec. 101. Authorization for border control strategies.\n       This section authorizes the appropriation to the Department \n     of Justice of the funds necessary for expanded control at the \n     land borders.\n       Sec. 102. Border patrol expansion.\n       This section mandates the Attorney General in fiscal years \n     1996, 1997, and 1998, to increase the number of border patrol \n     agents to the maximum extent possible and consistent with \n     standards of professionalism and training, by no fewer than \n     700 each year.\n       Sec. 103. Land border inspection enhancements.\n       This section mandates the Attorney General, subject to \n     appropriations or the availability of funds in the Border \n     Services User Fee Account, to increase the number of land \n     border inspectors in fiscal years 1996 and 1997 to a level \n     that will provide full staffing to end undue delay and \n     facilitate inspections at the land border ports of entry.\n       Sec. 104. Increased penalties for failure to depart, \n     illegal reentry, and passport and visa fraud.\n       Section 104(a) directs the U.S. Sentencing Commission to \n     increase the base offense level under section 242(e) for \n     failure to depart under an order of deportation, and section \n     276(b) for illegal reentry after deportation to reflect the \n     enhanced penalties provided in section 130001 of the Violent \n     Crime Control Act of 1994 (VCCA).\n       The VCCA made failure to depart after a final order of \n     deportation punishable by imprisonment of not more than four \n     years, or not more than 10 years if the alien is deportable \n     for alien smuggling, has committed certain other criminal \n     offenses, has failed to register, has falsified documents, or \n     is engaged in security-related espionage or terrorism.\n       The VCCA also provided for punishment of 10 years \n     imprisonment of any alien who reenters subsequent to \n     deportation for conviction or commission of three or more \n     misdemeanors involving drugs, crimes against the person, or \n     both. Imprisonment for aliens who reenter after deportation \n     for aggravated felony was raised from 15 to 20 years.\n       Section 104(b) directs the Sentencing Commission to make \n     appropriate increases in the base offense level for sections \n     1541-46 of Title 18, U.S.C. (passport and visa fraud) to \n     reflect the enhanced penalties provided in section 130009 of \n     the VCCA.\n       The VCCA increases the penalties for passport and visa \n     fraud to up to 10 years imprisonment in most cases; and \n     changes prior law by eliminating the option for fines instead \n     of imprisonment and increasing the maximum number of years in \n     prison.\n       Sec. 105. Pilot program on interior repatriation of \n     deportable or excludable aliens.\n        This section permits the Attorney General to establish a \n     pilot program for deportation of persons to the interior, \n     rather than the border area, of a contiguous country. It \n     mandates a report to Congress not later than 3 years after \n     initiation of any pilot program.\n       Sec. 106. Special exclusion in extraordinary migration \n     situations.\n       This section will aid with border control by allowing \n     aliens to be excluded from entering the United States during \n     extraordinary migration situations or when the aliens are \n     arriving on board smuggling vessels. Persons with a credible \n     fear of persecution in their countries of nationality will be \n     allowed to enter the United States to apply for asylum.\n       Section 106(a) amends section 235 of the Immigration and \n     Nationality Act (INA) to clarify that an alien in exclusion \n     proceedings who has arrived from a foreign contiguous country \n     may be returned to that country while the proceedings are \n     pending.\n       Section 106(b) amends section 235 of the INA, relating to \n     inspection requirements, by adding two new subsections, \n     235(d) and 235(e). New subsection (d) allows the Attorney \n     General to order an alien excluded and deported without a \n     hearing before an immigration judge. This authority may be \n     exercised when the Attorney General declares an extraordinary \n     migration situation to exist (because of the number of aliens \n     en route to or arriving in the United States, including by \n     aircraft) or when aliens are brought to the United States or \n     arrive in the United States on board a smuggling vessel. \n     (This language is virtually identical to that passed by the \n     full Senate Judiciary Committee in August 1994 as a \n     substitute for the general expedited exclusion authority \n     proposed in S. 1333.)\n       A person will not be subject to expedited exclusion if he \n     or she claims asylum and establishes a credible fear of \n     persecution in his or her country of nationality. However, a \n     person may be returned to a third country in which he or she \n     has no credible fear of persecution or of return to \n     persecution.\n       There is no administrative review of an order of special \n     exclusion except for persons previously admitted to the \n     United States as lawful permanent residents. Asylum denials \n     would be reviewable by an asylum officer, \n     [[Page S6103]] but there is no judicial review of the asylum \n     denial. (See section 308, below, for amendments to the \n     judicial review provisions of the INA, which limit judicial \n     review of a special exclusion order to certain issues through \n     habeas proceedings.\n\n       New subsection 235(e) provides that a person may not attack \n     prior orders of deportation as a defense against penalties \n     for illegal reentries.\n       Sec. 107. Immigration emergency provisions.\n       Section 107(a) amends section 404(b) of the INA to permit \n     reimbursement of other Federal agencies, as well as the \n     States, out of the immigration emergency fund. Reimbursements \n     could be made to other countries for repatriation expenses \n     without the requirements that the President declare an \n     immigration emergency.\n       Section 107(b) amends 50 U.S.C. 191 (Magnuson Act) to \n     permit the control and seizure of vessels when the Attorney \n     General determines that urgent circumstances exist due to a \n     mass migration of aliens.\n       Section 107(c) amends section 101(a) of the INA by \n     authorizing the Attorney General to designate local \n     enforcement officers to enforce the immigration laws when the \n     Attorney General determines that an actual or imminent mass \n     migration of aliens present urgent circumstances.\n       Sec. 108. Commuter land pilot programs.\n       To facilitate border management, this section amends \n     section 286(q) of the INA and the 1994 Department of Justice \n     Appropriations Act to permit expansion of commuter lane pilot \n     programs at land borders.\n       It also amends the 1994 Justice Appropriations Act to allow \n     the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) to establish \n     these projects on the Northern, as well as the Southern, \n     border.\n\n\n       title ii--control of unlawful employment and verification\n\n       Sec. 201. Reducing the number of employment verification \n     documents.\n       The provisions of this section will strengthen enforcement \n     of employer sanctions. These provisions will assist interior \n     enforcement and decrease nonimmigrant overstays by making it \n     more difficult for illegal aliens to gain unlawful \n     employment.\n       Section 201(a) amends section 274A(b)(2) of the INA to \n     permit the Attorney General to require any individual to \n     provide his or her Social Security account number on any \n     forms required as part of employment verification process.\n       Section 201(b) amends section 274A(b)(1)(B) of the INA to \n     eliminate three types of documents that may be present to \n     establish both an individual's employment authorization and \n     identity.\n       Under current law, by statute and regulation, an individual \n     may present 1 or more of up to 29 documents to establish \n     employment authorization, identity, or both.\n       Documents that now establish both employment authorization \n     and identity are a U.S. passport, certificate of U.S. \n     citizenship, certificate of naturalization, unexpired foreign \n     passport with work authorization, or a resident alien card or \n     other alien registration card containing a photograph and \n     work authorization. Under this amendment, only a U.S. \n     passport, resident alien card, or alien registration card or \n     other employment authorization document issued by the \n     Attorney General would establish both employment \n     authorization and identity.\n       Subsection (b) also amends 274A(b)(1)(C) of the INA to \n     eliminate the use of a U.S. birth certificate as a document \n     that can establish work authorization.\n       Subsections (a) and (b) would apply with respect to hirings \n     occurring not later than 180 days after enactment, as \n     designated by the Attorney General.\n       Sec. 202. Employment verification pilot projects.\n       This section provides for the Attorney General, working \n     with the Commissioner of Social Security, to conduct pilot \n     projects to test methods for reliable and nondiscriminatory \n     verification of employment eligibility. Pilot programs may \n     include the expansion of the telephone verification system up \n     to 1000 employers; a simulated linkage of INS and Social \n     Security Administration (SSA) databases; a process to allow \n     employers to verify employment eligibility through SSA \n     records using INS records as a crosscheck; and improvements \n     and additions to the INS and SSA databases to make\n      them more accessible for employment verification purposes. \n     Pilots are to run for 3 years with an option for a 1-year \n     extension and are to be limited to certain geographical \n     locations. The Attorney General may require employers \n     participating in the pilots to post notices informing \n     employees of their participation and of procedures for \n     filing complaints with the Attorney General regarding the \n     operation of the pilots.\n       At the end of the 3-year period, the Attorney General must \n     report to Congress regarding the cost effectiveness, \n     technical feasibility, resistance to fraud, and impact upon \n     privacy and anti-discrimination policies of the various pilot \n     projects.\n       Sec. 203. Confidentiality of data under employment \n     eligibility verification pilot projects.\n       Section 203(a) provides for the confidentiality of \n     individual information collected in the operation of pilot \n     projects under section 202. No individual information may be \n     made available to any Government agencies, employers, or \n     other persons other than as necessary to verify that the \n     employee is not an authorized alien. In addition, the \n     information may be used for enforcement of the INA and for \n     criminal enforcement of the immigration-related fraud \n     provisions of Title 18 (sections 911, 1001, 1028, 1546, and \n     1621).\n       Pursuant to section 203(b), participating employers must \n     have in place procedures to safeguard the personal \n     information and notify employees of their right to request \n     correction or amendment of their records. These procedures \n     will be detailed in a standard memorandum of understanding \n     signed by INS and each employer.\n       Section 203(c) makes the provisions, rights and remedies of \n     5 U.S.C. 552a(a)(2), applicable to all work-authorized \n     persons who are subject to work authorization verification \n     under section 202 with respect to records used in the course \n     of a pilot project to make a final determination concerning \n     an individual's work authorization.\n       Pursuant to section 203(d), employers and other persons are \n     subject to civil penalties from $1,000 to $10,000 for the \n     willful and knowing unlawful disclosure or use of information \n     or failure to comply with subsection 203(b).\n       Section 203(e) states that nothing in this section shall \n     limit the rights and remedies otherwise available to U.S. \n     citizens and lawful permanent residents under 5 U.S.C. 552a.\n       Section 203(f) states that nothing in this section or \n     section 202 shall be construed to authorize, directly or \n     indirectly, the issuance or use of national identification \n     cards or the establishment of a national identification card.\n       Sec. 204. Collection of Social Security numbers.\n       To facilitate the use of Social Security numbers in \n     immigration-related activities, this section adds a new \n     subsection 264(f) to the INA to clarify that the Attorney \n     General may require any alien to provide his or her Social \n     Security number for inclusion in any record maintained by the \n     Attorney General. (This is a companion to section 201(a), \n     described above.)\n       Sec. 205. Employer sanctions penalties.\n       Section 205(a) amends section 274A(e)(4)(A) of the INA to \n     increase the civil penalties for employer sanctions for first \n     violations from the current range of $250 to $2,000 to a \n     range of $1,000 to $3,000. The subsection also increases \n     penalties for second violations from the current range of \n     $2,000 to $5,000 to a range of $3,000 to $8,000. The \n     penalties for subsequent violations are increased from a \n     range of $3,000 to $10,000 to a range of $8,000 to $25,000.\n       Section 205(b) amends section 274A(e)(5) of the INA to \n     increase the penalties for employer sanctions paperwork \n     violations from the current range of $100 to $1,000 to a \n     range of $200 to $5,000.\n       Section 205(c) amends section 274A(f)(1) of the INA to \n     increase the criminal penalty for pattern and practice \n     violations of employer sanctions to a felony offense, \n     increasing the applicable fines from $3,000 to $7,000 and the \n     criminal sentence which may be imposed from not more than six \n     months to not more than two years.\n       Sec. 206. Criminal penalties for document fraud.\n       Section 206(a) amends 18 U.S.C. 1028(b)(1), on \n     identification document fraud, to increase the maximum term \n     of imprisonment from 5 to 10 years. The maximum term of \n     imprisonment is up to 15 years if committed to facilitate a \n     drug trafficking offense, and up to 20 years if committed to \n     facilitate an act of international terrorism.\n       Section 206(b) directs the Sentencing Commission promptly \n     to make appropriate increases in all of the base offense \n     levels for immigration document fraud offenses under 18 \n     U.S.C. 1028.\n       Sec. 207. Civil penalties for document fraud.\n       Section 207(a) amends section 274C(a) of the INA to apply \n     civil penalties in cases where an alien has presented a \n     travel document upon boarding a vessel for United States, but \n     fails to present the document upon arrival (``document-\n     destroyers''). A discretionary waiver of these penalties is \n     provided if the alien is subsequently granted asylum.\n       Subsection (a) also applies civil penalties against a \n     person who prepares, files, or assists another person in \n     preparing or filing, certain false documents in reckless \n     disregard of the fact that the information is false or does \n     not relate to the applicant.\n       Section 207(b) conforms section 274(c)(d)(3) to refer to \n     ``each document that is the subject of a violation under \n     subsection (a)''. This will clarify that an alien who does \n     not present a document (because it was destroyed) is subject \n     to penalties.\n       Sec. 208. Subpoena authority.\n       Section 208(a) amends section 274A(e)(2) of the INA to \n     clarify that immigration officers may issue subpoenas for \n     investigations of employer sanctions offenses under section \n     274A.\n       Section 208(b) adds a new section 294 to the INA to \n     authorize the Secretary of Labor to issue subpoenas for \n     investigations relating to the enforcement of any immigration \n     program. It makes the authority contained in sections 9 and \n     10 of the Federal Trade Commission Act (15 U.S.C. 49, 50) \n     available to the Secretary of Labor. The Federal Trade \n     Commission Act provisions allow access to documents and files \n     of corporations, including the authority to call witnesses \n     and require production of documents.\n       Sec. 209. Increased penalties for employer sanctions \n     involving labor standards violations.\n       [[Page S6104]] Section 209(a) adds a new paragraph \n     274A(e)(10) to the INA to authorize an administrative law \n     judge to increase the civil penalties provided under employer \n     sanctions to an amount up to two times the normal penalties, \n     for willful or repeated violations of: (i) the Fair Labor \n     Standards Act (29 U.S.C. 201 et seq.); (ii) the Migrant and \n     Seasonal Agricultural Worker Protection Act (29 U.S.C. 1801 \n     et seq.); and (iii) the Family and Medical Leave Act (29 \n     U.S.C. 2601 et seq.).\n       Section 209(b) adds a new paragraph, section 274B(g)(4), to \n     the INA to make the same provisions in (a) above applicable \n     in section 274B, unfair immigration-related employment \n     practices.\n       Sec. 210. Increased civil penalties for unfair immigration-\n     related employment practices.\n       This section amends section 274B(g)(2)(B) of the INA to \n     increase the civil penalties applicable for unfair \n     immigration-related employment practices to make the \n     penalties comparable to the increased proposed for employer \n     sanctions violations.\n       The penalty for a first violation would be increased from \n     the current range of $250 to $2,000 to a range of $1,000 to \n     $3,000. The penalty for a second violation would be increased \n     from the current range of $2,000 to $5,000 to a range of \n     $3,000 to $8,000. The penalty for more than two violations \n     would be increased from the current range of $3,000 to \n     $10,000 to a range of $8,000 to $25,000.\n       The penalty for a documents violation, that is, requesting \n     more or different documents than are required or refusing to \n     honor documents tendered that on their face reasonably appear \n     to be genuine, would be increased from a range of $100 to \n     $1,000 to a range of $200 to $5,000.\n       Sec. 211. Retention of employer sanctions fines for law \n     enforcement purposes.\n       This section amends section 286(c) of the INA to credit to \n     INS appropriations any employer sanction penalties received \n     in excess of $5,000,000. These funds will be used to fund \n     employer sanctions enforcement and related expenses. The \n     funds credited to the account remain available until used.\n       Sec. 212. Telephone verification system fee.\n       This section amends section 274A(d) of the INA to authorize \n     INS to collect and retain the fees paid to use the telephone \n     verification system pilot project. These fees are to be \n     credited to the INS Salaries and Expenses appropriation as \n     offsetting collections solely for employer verification \n     services costs.\n       Sec. 213. Authorizations.\n       This section provides for blanket authorization for \n     appropriation of funds needed to carry out this title.\n\n\n                    title iii--illegal alien removal\n\n       Sec. 301. Civil penalties for failure to depart.\n       This section adds a new section 274D to the INA, to subject \n     aliens who willfully fail to depart after an order of \n     exclusion or deportation to a $500-per-day penalty (payable \n     to the INS Commissioner as offsetting collections). This \n     section would not diminish the criminal penalties at section \n     242(e) for failure to depart or any other section of the INA.\n       Sec. 302. Judicial deportation.\n       Section 302(a) amends section 242A(d)(1) of the INA to \n     authorize a U.S. district court to enter a judicial order of \n     deportation when the court imposes a sentence that causes the \n     alien to be deportable or when the alien previously has been \n     convicted of an aggravated felony. Current law limits \n     judicial deportation to the time of sentencing for an \n     aggravated felony conviction.\n       Section 302(b) amends section 242A(d)(3) to provide that a \n     judicial order of deportation or denial of the Government's \n     motion for such an order may be appealed by either party, as \n     part of the underlying criminal case.\n       Section 302(c) amends section 242A(d)(4) of the INA to \n     strike the reference to ``a decision on the merits.'' This \n     change clarifies that the INS may place an alien in \n     administrative deportation proceedings if a Federal district \n     court judge has declined the Government's petition to issue a \n     judicial deportation order.\n       Section 302(d) amends 18 U.S.C. 3583(d)(3) to provide that \n     a court may set as a condition of supervised release that an \n     alien defendant be ordered deported by the Attorney General \n     and that the alien remain outside the United States. This \n     amendment addresses an issue in litigation where district \n     court judges have read this section to authorize them to \n     order deportation.\n       Sec. 303. Conduct of proceedings by electronic means.\n       This section amends section 242(b) of the INA to permit \n     deportation proceedings to be conducted by video conference \n     or telephone, saving travel and hearing time and resources. \n     The alien must consent to such a hearing by telephone if it \n     is to be a full contested evidentiary hearing on the merits.\n       Sec. 304. Subpoena authority.\n       This section clarifies the authority of immigration judges \n     to issue subpoenas in proceedings under sections 236 \n     (exclusion) and 242 (deportation) of the INA.\n       Sec. 305. Stipulated exclusion and deportation.\n       This section amends sections 236 and 242 of the INA to \n     permit the entry of orders of exclusion and deportation \n     stipulated to by the alien and the INS, and to provide that \n     stipulated orders are conclusive. Department of Justice \n     regulations will provide that an alien who stipulates to an \n     exclusion or deportation order waives all appeal rights.\n       Sec. 306. Streamlining appeals from orders of exclusion and \n     deportation.\n       This section revises and amends section 106 of the INA. It \n     provides for judicial review of final administrative orders \n     of both deportation and exclusion through a petition for \n     review, filed within 30 days after the final order in the \n     judicial circuit in which the immigration judge completed the \n     proceedings. Under current law, an order of exclusion is \n     appealable to a district court and then appealable to the \n     court of appeals.\n       The Attorney General's findings of fact shall be conclusive \n     unless a reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to \n     conclude to the contrary.\n       As in current law, a court may review a final order only if \n     the alien has exhausted all administrative remedies. This \n     section adds a requirement that no other court may decide an \n     issue, unless the petition presents grounds that could not \n     have been presented previously or the remedy provided was \n     inadequate or ineffective to test the validity of the order.\n       A new section 106(e) provides that a petition for review \n     filed by an alien against whom a final order of deportation \n     has been issued under section 242A (aggravated felonies) will \n     be limited to whether the alien: is the alien described in \n     the order; has been convicted after entry of an aggravated \n     felony; and was afforded the appropriate deportation \n     proceedings.\n       Under section 106(f) there is no judicial review of an \n     individual order of special exclusion or of any other \n     challenge relating to the special exclusion provisions. The \n     only authorized review is through a habeas corpus proceeding, \n     limited to determinations of alienage, whether the petitioner \n     was ordered specially excluded, and whether the petitioner \n     can prove by a preponderance of the evidence that he or she \n     is an alien admitted for permanent residence and is entitled \n     to further inquiry. In such cases the court may order no \n     relief other than a hearing under section 236 or a \n     determination in accordance with sections 235(a) or 273(d). \n     There shall be no review of whether the alien was actually\n      excludable or entitled to relief.\n       Sec. 307. Sanctions against countries refusing to accept \n     deportation of their nationals.\n       This section amends section 243(g) of the INA to permit the \n     Secretary of State to refuse issuance of all visas to \n     nationals of countries that refuse to accept deportation of \n     their nationals from the United States. Under current law, \n     the Secretary of State has the authority only to refuse to \n     issue immigrant visas.\n       Sec. 308. Custody of aliens convicted of aggravated \n     felonies.\n       Section 308(a) amends section 236(e) of the INA to permit \n     the Attorney General to release an aggravated felon alien who \n     is in exclusion proceedings from detention if the release is \n     necessary to provide protection to a witness, a potential \n     witness, or a person cooperating with a major criminal \n     investigation, or to protect an immediate family member of \n     such a person.\n       Section 308(b) amends section 242(a)(2) of the INA to \n     permit the Attorney General to release an aggravated felon \n     alien who is in deportation proceedings from detention if the \n     release is necessary to provide protection to a witness, a \n     potential witness, or a person cooperating with a major \n     criminal investigation, or to protect an immediate family \n     member of such a person.\n       Sec. 309. Limitations on relief from exclusion and \n     deportation.\n       Section 309(a) amends section 212(c) of the INA to limit \n     relief under section 212(c) of the INA to a person who has \n     been lawfully admitted to the U.S. for at least 7 years, has \n     been a lawful permanent resident for at least 5 years, and is \n     returning to such residence after having temporarily \n     proceeded abroad not under an order of deportation. The 5-\n     year and 7-year periods would end upon initiation of \n     exclusion proceedings. Also, relief under INA section 212(c) \n     will be available only to persons in exclusion proceedings. \n     Persons in deportation proceedings must now apply for \n     cancellation of deportation (described below). Finally, an \n     aggravated felon will be eligible for section 212(c) relief \n     only if he or she has been sentenced to less than 5 years, in \n     the aggregate, for the aggravated felony conviction or \n     convictions. Time actually served will not be a factor in \n     determining eligibility.\n       Section 309(b) amends section 244 of the INA to consolidate \n     two existing forms of relief from deportation (suspension of \n     deportation under section 244 and a waiver of deportability \n     under section 212(c)) into one form of relief, ``Cancellation \n     of Deportation.'' A lawful permanent resident (LPR) would be \n     eligible for cancellation if he or she has been an LPR for 5 \n     years, has resided in the U.S. after lawful admission for 7 \n     years, and has not been convicted of an aggravated felony or \n     felonies for which he or she has been sentenced, in the \n     aggregate, to a term or terms of 5 years or more. A non-LPR \n     would be eligible for relief if he or she had been \n     continuously physically present for 7 years, was of good \n     moral character, and could establish extreme hardship to the \n     alien or the alien's U.S. citizen spouse or child if \n     deported. The 7-year and 5-year periods end with the issuance \n     of an Order to Show Cause initiating deportation proceedings. \n     This provision would clarify an area of the law regarding the \n     cutoff periods for these benefits that have given rise to \n     significant litigation and different rules being applied in \n     different judicial circuits.\n       This section also amends the existing provisions for \n     voluntary departure. Prehearing \n     [[Page S6105]] voluntary departure may be granted to any \n     alien other than an aggravated felon. The Attorney General \n     may require a voluntary departure bond. At the conclusion of \n     a deportation proceeding, voluntary departure may be granted \n     only if the person has been of good moral character for 5 \n     years prior to the order, is not deportable under certain \n     criminal or national security grounds, and demonstrates by \n     clear and convincing evidence that he or she has the means to \n     depart the United States and intends to do so. The alien \n     would be required to post a voluntary departure bond. An \n     alien would be subject to civil penalties of $500 per day for \n     failure to depart within the time set for voluntary \n     departure. Judicial review of voluntary departure orders \n     would be limited.\n       An alien would be subject to civil penalties of $500 per \n     day for failure to depart within the time set for voluntary \n     departure. Judicial review of a voluntary departure order \n     would be prohibited if relief was granted for 30 days or \n     more. Judicial review of a denial of voluntary departure \n     could not stay deportation of an alien after 60 days had \n     passed from issuance of an order of deportation.\n       Section 309(c) makes conforming amendments to sections \n     242(b) and 242B(e) of the INA.\n       Section 309(d) provides that the effective date of this \n     section is the date of enactment, except that subsections (a) \n     and (b), relating to the determination of when the period of \n     residency or of continuous physical presence ends, are \n     applicable only to orders to show cause filed on or after the \n     date of enactment. The conforming amendments made by \n     subsection (c) are effective on enactment.\n       Sec. 310. Rescission of lawful permanent resident status.\n       This section amends section 246(a) of the INA to clarify \n     that the Attorney\n      General is not required to rescind the lawful permanent \n     resident status of a deportable alien separate and apart \n     from the deportation proceeding under section 242 or 242A. \n     This provision will allow INS to place a lawful permanent \n     resident who has become deportable into deportation \n     proceedings immediately.\n       Sec. 311. Increasing efficiency in removal of detained \n     aliens.\n       This section authorizes appropriations for the Attorney \n     General to conduct a pilot program or programs to study \n     methods for increasing the efficiency of deportation and \n     exclusion proceedings against detained aliens by increasing \n     availability of pro bono counseling and representation. The \n     Attorney General may use funds to award grants to not-for-\n     profit organizations assisting aliens.\n\n\n                   title iv--alien smuggling control\n\n       Sec. 401. Wiretap authority for investigations of alien \n     smuggling and document fraud.\n       This section amends 18 U.S.C. 2516(l) to give INS the \n     authority to use wiretaps in investigations of alien \n     smuggling and document fraud.\n       Sec. 402. Applying racketeering offenses to alien \n     smuggling.\n       This section amends 18 U.S.C. 1961(l) to include the \n     offenses relating to alien smuggling as predicate offenses \n     for racketeering charges. The application of RICO to \n     smuggling will be limited to those offenses committed for \n     commercial advantage or private financial gain.\n       Sec. 403. Expanded asset forfeiture for smuggling or \n     harboring aliens.\n       This section amends 274 of the INA to authorize seizure and \n     forfeiture of real and personal property in cases of alien \n     smuggling and harboring. Current forfeiture authority is \n     limited to conveyances. INS must give notice to owners of an \n     intent to forfeit.\n       Sec. 404. Increased criminal penalties for alien smuggling.\n       This section amends section 274(a)(1)(A) of the INA to add \n     conspiracy and aiding and abetting to the smuggling offenses, \n     with offenders being subject to a fine, and/or 10 years \n     imprisonment for conspiracy and/or 5 years imprisonment for \n     aiding and abetting. It makes it a criminal offense to hire \n     an alien with the knowledge that the alien is not authorized \n     to work and that the alien was smuggled into the U.S. The \n     penalty for violating this section is a fine and/or up to 5 \n     years imprisonment.\n       This section also amends section 274(a)(2) of the INA to \n     increase the penalties for multiple smuggling offenses (and \n     for a new offense for smuggling aliens who will be committing \n     crimes) to not less than 3 years or more than 10 years of \n     imprisonment.\n       Sec. 405. Undercover investigation authority.\n       This section authorizes INS to use appropriated funds to \n     lease space, establish, acquire, or operate business entities \n     for undercover operations, so-called ``proprietaries'' to \n     facilitate undercover immigration-related criminal \n     investigations. INS may deposit funds generated by these \n     operations or use them to offset operational expenses.\n       Sec. 406. Amended definition of aggravated felony.\n       Section 406(a) amends section 101(a)(43)(N) of the INA, to \n     strike the reference to title 18, U.S.C. in defining alien \n     smuggling as an aggravated felony. This amendment will result \n     in the inclusion of the smuggling offenses in section 274 of \n     the INA into the definition of aggravated felony. It also \n     amends the definition of ``aggravated felony'' by adding a \n     requirement that the offense of trafficking in document fraud \n     to be ``for the purpose of commercial advantage.''\n       Section 406(b) amends section 101(a)(43) to provide that \n     the term ``aggravated felony'' applies for all purposes to \n     convictions entered before, on, or after the date of \n     enactment of this Act. This amendment will end controversy on \n     which convictions fall within the definition.\n       Section 406(c) amends section 243(h) of the INA to provide \n     that for purposes of determining whether an alien is \n     ineligible for withholding of deportation based on conviction \n     for an aggravated felony, the alien must have been sentenced \n     to five years or more. Currently any aggravated felon is \n     ineligible for withholding of deportation.\n\n\n                  title v--inspections and admissions\n\n       Sec. 501. Civil penalties for bringing inadmissible aliens \n     from contiguous territories.\n       This section amends section 273(a) to establish the \n     illegality of bringing inadmissible aliens from foreign \n     contiguous territories. It amends section 273(b) of the INA \n     to increase from $3,000 to $5,000 the fine for bringing in an \n     alien unlawfully.\n       Sec. 502. Definition of stowaway; excludability of \n     stowaway; carrier liability for costs of detention.\n       Section 502(a) adds a definition of stowaway to the INA \n     (section 101(a)) to mean any alien who obtains transportation \n     without consent or through concealment or evasion.\n       Section 502(b) amends section 237 of the INA to clarify \n     that a stowaway is subject to immediate exclusion and \n     deportation. However, it allows a stowaway to apply for \n     asylum or withholding of deportation.\n       Section 502(c) amends section 273(d) of the INA to require \n     the carrier to detain a stowaway until he or she has been \n     inspected by an immigration officer and to pay for any \n     detention costs incurred by the Attorney General should the \n     alien be taken into custody. It amends section 273(d) by \n     raising the fine for failure to remove a stowaway from $3,000 \n     to $5,000 per stowaway, payable to the Commissioner as \n     offsetting collections.\n       Sec. 503. List of alien and citizen passengers arriving or \n     departing.\n       This section amends section 231(a) of the INA to clarify \n     the content of and format for passenger lists and manifests \n     to be prepared and submitted by carriers to INS, including \n     name, date of birth, gender, citizenship, travel document \n     number, and arriving flight number.\n       Sec. 504. Elimination of limitations on immigration user \n     fees for certain cruise ship passengers.\n       This section amends section 286(e)(1) of the INA to remove \n     the current exemption from payment of the $6 immigration user \n     fee for cruise ship passengers.\n       Sec. 505. Transportation line responsibility for transit \n     without visa aliens.\n       This section amends section 238(c) of the INA to provide \n     that a carrier which has entered into an agreement with the \n     United States to transport aliens without visas through the \n     U.S. must agree to indemnify the United States for any costs \n     of detaining or removing such an alien.\n       Sec. 506. Authority to determine visa processing \n     procedures.\n       This section amends section 202(a)(1) of the INA, which \n     provides that visas must be issued without discrimination \n     because of race, sex, nationality, place of birth, or place \n     of residence, to state that nothing in this subsection limits \n     the authority of the Secretary of State to determine \n     procedures for processing visas. This section would reverse a \n     recent judicial decision which interpreted the existing \n     language to require the Secretary of State to process visas \n     in a specific location.\n       Sec. 507. Border services user fee.\n       This section adds a new subsection 286(s) to the INA, \n     authorizing the Attorney General to charge and collect a \n     border services user fee for every land border entry, \n     including persons arriving at U.S. borders by ferry, at \n     participating ports-of-entry. The fee is to be collected in \n     U.S. Currency and is set at $1.50 for each non-commercial \n     conveyance, and $.75 for each pedestrian. Commercial \n     passenger conveyances will be charged the pedestrian fee for \n     operator and each passenger, except that ferry crewmen are \n     not subject to the fee.\n       The section provides for each State to determine at which, \n     if any, ports the fee is to be collected. A State that \n     exercises this local option may establish a Border Service \n     Council for each port to develop priorities for use of the \n     fees collected, for submission to the Attorney General. The \n     Attorney General must consider these priorities in funding \n     port services. Funds remaining after payment of the costs of \n     port services are to be given to the Councils to spend on \n     port-related enhancements. The Attorney General will allocate \n     enhancement funds for ports that do not set up a Border \n     Service Council.\n       The Council membership must include three state \n     representatives appointed by the Governor including at least \n     one business representative, three local representatives, and \n     three federal representatives.\n       A State may withdraw a port from participation after \n     amortizing improvements and after one year's notice.\n       The Attorney General is authorized to provide special \n     discounts for frequent border crossers, to adjust the fee to \n     compensate for inflation and cover increased costs, and to \n     contract with private and public sectors to collect the fee. \n     The Attorney General may establish such penalties for non-\n     payment of the fees as are necessary to ensure compliance. \n     The Attorney General is authorized to advance to the Border \n     Services User Fee Account the amount of the start up costs \n     from the Department of Justice's Working Capital Fund. \n     Receipts from the fee will be transferred back from the \n     Border Services User \n     [[Page S6106]] Fee Account and deposited as offsetting \n     receipts to the Working Capital Fund to cover this advance.\n       The Attorney General will begin collecting the fee not \n     later than 12 months from the date the State notifies the \n     Attorney General that it has selected ports to participate in \n     the fee program.\n\n\n            title vi--miscellaneous and technical amendments\n\n       Sec. 601. Alien prostitution.\n       This section amends section 2424 of Title 18, U.S.C. \n     (relating to filing statements with INS when bringing in \n     aliens for immoral purposes) to add as a requirement for the \n     offense that a person bringing in an alien for prostitution \n     do so ``knowing[ly] or in reckless disregard.'' It also \n     deletes the statutory reference to signatories to the 1902 \n     international convention and increases the maximum sentence \n     for the offense from two to ten years.\n       Sec. 602.

L. 103-322. Section \n     130003(c)(1) created a new subsection 245(i) of the Act to \n     provide for the adjustment of status for certain aliens in S \n     nonimmigrant status. A technical correction is necessary \n     because section 506(b) of the Commerce, Justice, and State \n     appropriations statute, P.L. 103-317 (Aug. 26, 1994) had \n     previously created a new subsection 245(i) to provide for the \n     adjustment of status of certain aliens previously ineligible \n     for such privilege. This proposed statutory amendment would \n     redesignate the S-related adjustment provision as section \n     245(j) of the Act.\n       Section 603(b) amends section 130004(b)(3) of P.L. 103-322 \n     by removing an incorrect reference to section 242A(b)(5) and \n     replacing it with proper reference to paragraph (b)(4).\n       Sec. 604. Expeditious deportation.\n       This section amends Section 225 of the Immigration and \n     Nationality Technical Corrections Act of 1994, P.L. 104-416, \n     by adding a reference to section 242A of the INA (which \n     requires the Attorney General to commence deportation \n     proceedings promptly) to the existing reference to section \n     242(i) (also requiring expeditious deportation), so that \n     section 225 now provides that neither of those provisions \n     create any enforceable substantive or procedural right or \n     benefit against the United States.\n       Sec. 605.

A bill to amend the Atomic Energy Act of 1954 to provide for \nthe privatization of the U.S. Enrichment Corporation; to the Committee \non Energy and Natural Resources.\n\n\n                         usec privatization act\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I rise today on behalf of myself and \nSenators Ford, Johnston, Campbell, Thomas, and Simpson to introduce the \nUSEC Privatization Act.\n  The U.S. Enrichment Corporation is a federally owned corporation \nestablished pursuant to the Energy Policy Act of 1992. Prior to the \ntransition mandated by the Energy Policy Act, USEC's functions were \nperformed by the Department of Energy and its predecessor agencies.\n  Currently, the Corporation leases assets, most notably gaseous \ndiffusion plants at Portsmouth, OH, and Paducah, KY, from the \nDepartment of Energy. USEC continues to operate those facilities in a \nmanner similar to that in which they were operated prior to the \ntransition. USEC also assumed contractual responsibility to implement \nuranium enrichment contracts that were in existence at the transition \ndate and the right to utilize the gaseous diffusion facilities leased \nfrom the Department to provide uranium enrichment services, for the \nmost part, as the market dictates.\n  The legislation I have introduced today would complete the transition \nprocess initiated by the Energy Policy Act by establishing USEC as a \nprivately owned entity. The legislation is necessary to provide for a \nsmooth transition and to resolve a number of issues not considered by \nthe Energy Policy Act.\n  The legislation provides for the transfer of employment, health, and \npension benefits of current employees from the current Government-owned \nCorporation to the private corporation. The language included in the \nlegislation has been developed by USEC and the Department of Energy \nworking in conjunction with the Office of Personnel Management. In \naddition, the union that represents the majority of employees at the \nPortsmouth and Paducah gaseous diffusion plants; the Oil, Chemical, and \nAtomic Workers International Union have made recommendations. It is my \nclear intention to protect the interests of those employees through the \ntransition.\n  One of the most difficult and complicated issues facing USEC, and the \nuranium industry as a whole, is the reintroduction into the commercial \nmarket of uranium produced for defense purposes. During the cold war, \nuranium was produced for national security requirements in huge volumes \nwith almost no consideration of cost. Treaty mandated reductions in \nnuclear arsenals have suddenly surplused much of that material. In \naddition, there is significant pressure to process fissile material \nfrom dismantled weapons in order to limit the ability to easily \nreconstitute those weapons. In the case of highly enriched uranium, \nthose pressures have\n resulted in efforts, both in the United States and the former Soviet \nUnion, to blend the material into low-enriched uranium suitable for \nelectricity generation in commercial reactors.\n\n  Low-enriched uranium derived from highly enriched uranium, regardless \nof its country of origin, has suddenly become available in large \nquantities and, for the most part, in order to be sold in the \ncommercial market, is being offered at prices significantly below its \ntotal production costs. Material once required regardless of cost, is \nnow available to be sold at the marginal costs of blending it down--\nsignificantly below the production costs of even the most efficient \nproducers in operation today.\n   U.S. trade law prohibits imported low-enriched uranium derived from \nhighly enriched uranium from being dumped into U.S. markets. The \nDepartment of Commerce currently enforces restrictions on all uranium \nimported from the Russian Federation through the Amendment to the \nAgreement Suspending the Antidumping Investigation on Uranium from the \nRussian Federation, Department of Commerce Investigation No. A-821-802, \ndated March 11, 1994, the Suspension Agreement. In addition, the \nDepartment of State has recently reached an understanding with Canada \non the Implementation of the Suspension Agreement particularly as it \npertains to the natural uranium component of low-enriched uranium \nderived from highly enriched uranium. That understanding stipulates \nthat such material could be used only in the operation of the U.S. \nEnrichment Corporation, for example, for overfeeding purposes, for sale \nin accordance with Section IV.M of the Suspension Agreement, for \nexample, outside of the United States, or it could be returned to \nRussia.\n  Those commitments place severe restrictions on the ability of the \nUnited States to implement the Agreement Between the Government of the \nUnited States of America and the Government of the Russian Federation \nConcerning the Disposition of Highly Enriched Uranium Extracted from \nNuclear Weapons, the HEU Agreement. That agreement calls upon the \nexecutive agent for the United States, currently USEC, to purchase $8 \nbillion of separative work units and $4 billion of natural uranium \ndisplaced by low-enriched uranium derived from highly enriched uranium \nfrom former Soviet nuclear weapons between now and 2013. While USEC may \nsell the separative work units into the commercial market, the \nSuspension Agreement and the understanding with Canada prevent USEC \nfrom selling the vast majority of the natural uranium derived from the \nagreement. While USEC is technically obligated to pay the Russians for \nthe natural component only when it is sold or 2013, whichever comes \nfirst, Russia has made it clear that failure to pay for the natural \nuranium upon delivery jeopardizes the entire HEU Agreement--clearly a \ndetriment to United States national security interests.\n  This legislation proposes an innovative remedy to this situation. \nSimply put, natural uranium displaced by low-enriched uranium imported \nunder the HEU Agreement would be deemed to be \n[[Page S6107]] of Russian origin and title of such material would be \ngiven to Russia. That material would be subject to the Suspension \nAgreement and the\n understanding with Canada accept that it could be sold for commercial \nend use in the United States starting in 2002 according to a schedule \ndefined in the legislation.\n\n  Under this proposal, the Russians would be able to sell natural \nuranium derived from the HEU Agreement for future deliveries; in effect \nestablishing a futures market. The price the Russians would be able to \nderive for the material sold now as futures would be dependent upon the \nconditions of commercial agreements between the Russians and any \nprivate investment entity, and would vary depending on predicted prices \nin the year 2002 and beyond.\n  However, it is my estimate that the net present value of that \nmaterial is somewhere near $7 per pound. While that is below the \ncurrent market price of $11.50 per pound, a futures contract could \nprovide for an immediate cash purchase of the uranium instead of the \ncontinued uncertainty and possible delay of reimbursement until 2013.\n  In addition to the benefits to the Russians, the United States gains \nbecause the Suspension Agreement and commitments made to Canada would \nstand. The USEC privatization is able to proceed without the \nuncertainty of a potential $4 billion obligation, and because the \nSuspension Agreement continues in its current form, the United States \nuranium industry is allowed to continue to operate according to market \nconditions.\n  The United States also has significant, undertermined inventories of \nexcess highly enriched uranium and low-enriched uranium. This \nlegislation establishes a series of requirements that must be met \nbefore that material may enter the civilian market. Prior to the \nprivatization date, the Secretary may agree to transfer up to 4 million \nseparative work units and 7,000 metric tons or natural uranium to USEC. \nHowever, that material may be delivered for commercial end use only \naccording to a defined disposition schedule.\n  Additional material, transferred to USEC from the Department of \nEnergy following privatization may also enter the commercial market. \nHowever, prior to any such sale, the Secretary of Energy must conduct a \nfull rulemaking to determine that the sale of the material will not \nhave an adverse impact on the domestic mining or enrichment industry.\n  The legislation leaves in place the Energy Policy Act's provisions \nregarding liability. This issue will be considered in hearings. \nHowever, it is my intent that liabilities incurred following the \ntransition date will be borne by the government-owned enrichment \nenterprise in existence today and its privately owned successor \nfollowing the privatization date.\n  There are a number of issues the legislation does not address. It \ndoes not include language proposed by USEC to enable USEC to\n commercialize organic membrane technology developed by the Department \nof Energy for uranium enrichment purposes. National security \nconsiderations and a desire to maintain a level playing field for \ntechnology transfer make this an issue best considered at a hearing \nbefore it is included in legislation. The legislation is also silent on \nthe renegotiation of the current USEC-Department of Energy lease for \nthe gaseous diffusion facilities. This may be an issue that is \naddressed following hearings.\n\n  Mr. President. The U.S. Enrichment Corporation falls within the \njurisdiction of the Subcommittee on Energy Research and Development of \nthe Committee on Energy and Natural Resources. I serve as chairman of \nthat subcommittee while my distinguished colleague from Kentucky, \nSenator Ford, serves as ranking member. It is my intention to hold \nhearings on this legislation as soon as practicable, preferably this \nmonth.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. ROCKEFELLER:\n  S. 756. A bill to expand United States exports of goods and services \nby requiring the development of objective criteria to achieve market \naccess in foreign countries, to provide the President with reciprocal \ntrade authority, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n                  the open markets and fair trade act\n\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I am rising to talk about a problem \nthat persists year after year, and a bill to do something about it. I'm \nspeaking of our trade deficit, which is out of control. Certainly, we \nare making progress on some micro-economic levels, and the Clinton \nadministration has hammered out more than 70 different trade agreements \nover the last 2-plus years--14 with Japan alone. These are helping some \nindustries, some workers, and some parts of our economy. But they have \ndone nothing to shrink the trade deficit. Clearly, more must be done.\n  The bill I am introducing today, the Open Markets and Fair Trade Act \nof 1995, will evaluate the current conditions of markets around the \nworld for American products and negotiate access to those markets. It \nalso gives the President and Congress a new tool to use in those \nnegotiations--the threat of reciprocal trade action. Basically the bill \ntells our trading partners that if they refuse to give our products \nreasonable market access, we may impose the same kind of restrictions \non their products.\n  For example, under this legislation, if negotiations with the \nJapanese over the aftermarket for autoparts reached an impasse, the \nPresident could come to Congress and seek a reciprocal trade action \nthat establishes a regulation that matches their strict regulations on \nrepairing cars, which today serve to effectively keep most American \nreplacement parts off Japanese cars. These restrictions only serve to \nhelp the Japanese producers and harm American manufacturers. In fact, \nalong with American companies and American workers, the Japanese \nconsumer is probably the biggest loser in the equation. It costs them \nabout $600 for a new alternator in Tokyo--the same part in the United \nStates costs about $120. A muffler sells for about $82 in the United \nStates, and $200 in Japan. And a shock absorber set costs about $230 \nhere, and over $600 in Tokyo.\n  The New York Times ran a story on May 2 that couldn't be more timely. \nEven with the dramatic rise of the yen, they reported that it still \ncosts $5.35 for a Florida grapefruit in Japan. And a can of Campbell's \nchicken noodle soup cost 220 yen today, the same as in 1991--when the \ndollar was more than 50 percent stronger. If the price of the soup had \ndropped to match\n the rise of the yen, a can of Campbell's soup would cost about 125 yen \ntoday, not 220 yen, or $2.75, as it is now being sold in Tokyo. It is \nclear that the savings that should accrue from the strength of the yen \nnever passed on to the Japanese consumer.\n\n  But let me stress, this bill does not single out Japan. I want to pry \nopen markets wherever they're closed, wherever in the world American \nproducts are denied access. Our trade deficit with Japan was $65 \nbillion last year; with China it was $30 billion; we had a deficit of \nalmost $14 billion with Canada, and Germany rang in at $14 billion. Mr. \nPresident, following my statement, I would like to include a chart that \nlists the top 10 countries in which America has a trade deficit. While \nnot all of these countries have barriers of the sort that this bill \nseeks to eliminate, a number of them clearly do. Again, this bill does \nnot specify one country or another, it is about following up on the \nUruguay round and looking beyond tariffs--it is designed to deal with \nmarket barriers; the internal rules in various countries that are \npractical impediments to American businesses. I am seeking to open more \nmarkets across the globe in order to bring about the increased exports \nand jobs that GATT promised.\n  And I think it's high time we question the wisdom that blames almost \nall of America's trade deficit problems solely on ourselves. For years, \nwe've heard the same assertions: ``Americans spend too much and save \ntoo little . . . the budget deficit is too high . . . we are growing \nfaster than other countries so we have more money to spend than you.'' \nYes, these economic realities contribute to the problem, but under \nPresident Clinton's leadership, we have reduced the Federal fiscal \ndeficit by over $700 billion, yet the trade deficit goes up and up.\n  I think it's time we reverse the premise and look at how the trade \ndeficit fuels our savings and debt problems. The inability of American \ncompanies \n[[Page S6108]] to sell in places like Japan, China, Germany, and \nelsewhere costs our corporations profits, our workers job \nopportunities, and our Nation revenues--all of which weigh down our own \neconomic growth and add to our fiscal deficit.\n  Whether it is a requirement for American firms to hire local agents \nto conduct business; cumbersome inspection and customs procedures; bans \non the sale of products for dubious claims of national sovereignty or \nsome other sort of prerogative, the simple fact is that protected \nsanctuary markets abroad are a major contributor to America's economic \nproblems.\n  To explain this simply, I will use as an example the well-known case \nof how Japanese manufacturers sell things like electronics in the \nUnited States at such cheap prices, even when the yen is at a record \nheight. I am citing Japan here, but it could be any other country that \nhas a ``sanctuary'' market. It is well-known that many Japanese-made \nproducts are cheaper in the United States than in Japan. That is \nbecause Japan's closed market is a sanctuary that effectively insulates \nproducers from competition, and allows them to over-charge Japanese \nconsumers, giving them enough of a profit margin at home to sell below \ncost here. That means American companies lose on both ends. We can't \nexport into these markets, and their subsidized exports harm our \ndomestic industries and cost us jobs.\n  My trade policy is quite simple, in addition to preserving the \neffectiveness of America's trade laws, I support measures that will \nincrease American exports, and West Virginia exports specifically. \nEvery $1 billion in exports supports about 17,000 jobs. So it follows \nthat if we increase American exports, we will create more jobs here in \nthe United States. And export related jobs are, on average, better, \nhigher paying jobs. That is why I have worked so hard to introduce West \nVirginia businesses to foreign market opportunities.\n  While this bill will expose countries with whom we have a trade \ndeficit to extra scrutiny by the Commerce Department, the Open Markets \nand Fair Trade Act of 1995 is about market opportunities for American \nfirms and especially markets for American industries with the most \nexport potential and which promote critical technologies. Most \nimportantly, it instructs the Commerce Department to look at markets \nwhich, if we can export there, offer the greatest employment \nopportunities for American workers.\n  America cannot afford to be a market for everyone else's products \nwhen we don't get the same kind of access in return. Our economy, and \nthe global economy, cannot sustain that kind of imbalance. The American \npeople will only continue to support free trade if it means we are able \nto sell American products abroad as easily as Asian and European and \nLatin American manufacturers have access to our shelves and showrooms. \nWhile past negotiations should have made these points perfectly clear, \nthe Open markets and Fair Trade Act of 1995 will erase any doubts that \nmay have lingered with our trading partners.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that additional material be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                  U.S. TRADE DEFICIT: TOP 10 COUNTRIES                  \n                        [In billions of dollars]                        \n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                               Trade deficit            \n             Country              --------------------------------------\n                                       1994         1993         1992   \n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n1.

Res. 33. A bill proposing an amendment to the Constitution of \nthe United States relative to the free exercise of religion; to the \nCommittee on the Judiciary.\n\n\n               constitutional amendment joint resolution\n\n Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I am pleased today to introduce a \njoint resolution proposing an amendment to the Constitution that will \nrestore to individuals the fundamental right to the free exercise of \ntheir religious beliefs.\n  Although most of us would agree that the Framers of the Constitution \nintended special protection for the ``free exercise of religion'' when \nthey included it in the Bill of Rights, several judicial rulings, and \nother acts of governments at all levels, over the years have brought \nthat provision into question and resulted in much confusion.\n  I invite Senators to support this reaffirmation of fundamental, \nconstitutional right.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url":

FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds that--\n       (1) each year millions of citizens of the United States \n     depend on the availability of lifesaving or life-enhancing \n     medical devices, many of which are permanently implantable \n     within the human body;\n       (2) a continued supply of raw materials and component parts \n     is necessary for the invention, development, improvement, and \n     maintenance of the supply of the devices;\n       (3) most of the medical devices are made with raw materials \n     and component parts that--\n       (A) are not designed or manufactured specifically for use \n     in medical devices; and\n       (B) come in contact with internal human tissue;\n       (4) the raw materials and component parts also are used in \n     a variety of nonmedical products;\n       (5) because small quantities of the raw materials and \n     component parts are used for medical devices, sales of raw \n     materials and component parts for medical devices constitute \n     an extremely small portion of the overall market for the raw \n     materials and medical devices;\n       (6) under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 \n     U.S.C. 301 et seq.), manufacturers of medical devices are \n     required to demonstrate that the medical devices are safe and \n     effective, including demonstrating that the products are \n     properly designed and have adequate warnings or instructions;\n       (7) notwithstanding the fact that raw materials and \n     component parts suppliers do not design, produce, or test a \n     final medical device, the suppliers have been the subject of \n     actions alleging inadequate--\n       (A) design and testing of medical devices manufactured with \n     materials or parts supplied by the suppliers; or\n       (B) warnings related to the use of such medical devices;\n       (8) even though suppliers of raw materials and component \n     parts have very rarely been held liable in such actions, such \n     suppliers have ceased supplying certain raw materials and \n     component parts for use in medical devices because the costs \n     associated with litigation in order to ensure a favorable \n     judgment for the suppliers far exceeds the total potential \n     sales revenues from sales by such suppliers to the medical \n     device industry;\n       (9) unless alternate sources of supply can be found, the \n     unavailability of raw materials and component parts for \n     medical devices will lead to unavailability of lifesaving and \n     life-enhancing medical devices;\n       (10) because other suppliers of the raw materials and \n     component parts in foreign nations are refusing to sell raw \n     materials or component parts for use in manufacturing certain \n     medical devices in the United States, the prospects for \n     development of new sources of supply for the full range of \n     threatened raw materials and component parts for medical \n     devices are remote;\n       (11) it is unlikely that the small market for such raw \n     materials and component parts in the United States could \n     support the large investment needed to develop new suppliers \n     of such raw materials and component parts;\n       (12) attempts to develop such new suppliers would raise the \n     cost of medical devices;\n       (13) courts that have considered the duties of the \n     suppliers of the raw materials and component parts have \n     generally found that the suppliers do not have a duty--\n       (A) to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the use of a raw \n     material or component part in a medical device; and\n       (B) to warn consumers concerning the safety and \n     effectiveness of a medical device;\n       (14) attempts to impose the duties referred to in \n     subparagraphs (A) and (B) of paragraph (13) on suppliers of \n     the raw materials and component parts would cause more harm \n     than good by driving the suppliers to cease supplying \n     manufacturers of medical devices; and\n       (15) in order to safeguard the availability of a wide \n     variety of lifesaving and life-enhancing medical devices, \n     immediate action is needed--\n       (A) to clarify the permissible bases of liability for \n     suppliers of raw materials and component parts for medical \n     devices; and\n       (B) to provide expeditious procedures to dispose of \n     unwarranted suits against the suppliers in such manner as to \n     minimize litigation costs.\n\n     SEC. 203.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This title may be cited as the ``Biomaterials Access \n     Assurance Act of 1995''.\n\n     SEC. 202. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds that--\n       (1) each year millions of citizens of the United States \n     depend on the availability of lifesaving or life-enhancing \n     medical devices, many of which are permanently implantable \n     within the human body;\n       (2) a continued supply of raw materials and component parts \n     is necessary for the invention, development, improvement, and \n     maintenance of the supply of the devices;\n       (3) most of the medical devices are made with raw materials \n     and component parts that--\n       (A) are not designed or manufactured specifically for use \n     in medical devices; and\n       (B) come in contact with internal human tissue;\n       (4) the raw materials and component parts also are used in \n     a variety of nonmedical products;\n       (5) because small quantities of the raw materials and \n     component parts are used for medical devices, sales of raw \n     materials and component parts for medical devices constitute \n     an extremely small portion of the overall market for the raw \n     materials and medical devices;\n       (6) under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 \n     U.S.C. 301 et seq.), manufacturers of medical devices are \n     required to demonstrate that the medical devices are safe and \n     effective, including demonstrating that the products are \n     properly designed and have adequate warnings or instructions;\n       (7) notwithstanding the fact that raw materials and \n     component parts suppliers do not design, produce, or test a \n     final medical device, the suppliers have been the subject of \n     actions alleging inadequate--\n       (A) design and testing of medical devices manufactured with \n     materials or parts supplied by the suppliers; or\n       (B) warnings related to the use of such medical devices;\n       (8) even though suppliers of raw materials and component \n     parts have very rarely been held liable in such actions, such \n     suppliers have ceased supplying certain raw materials and \n     component parts for use in medical devices because the costs \n     associated with litigation in order to ensure a favorable \n     judgment for the suppliers far exceeds the total potential \n     sales revenues from sales by such suppliers to the medical \n     device industry;\n       (9) unless alternate sources of supply can be found, the \n     unavailability of raw materials and component parts for \n     medical devices will lead to unavailability of lifesaving and \n     life-enhancing medical devices;\n       (10) because other suppliers of the raw materials and \n     component parts in foreign nations are refusing to sell raw \n     materials or component parts for use in manufacturing certain \n     medical devices in the United States, the prospects for \n     development of new sources of supply for the full range of \n     threatened raw materials and component parts for medical \n     devices are remote;\n       (11) it is unlikely that the small market for such raw \n     materials and component parts in the United States could \n     support the large investment needed to develop new suppliers \n     of such raw materials and component parts;\n       (12) attempts to develop such new suppliers would raise the \n     cost of medical devices;\n       (13) courts that have considered the duties of the \n     suppliers of the raw materials and component parts have \n     generally found that the suppliers do not have a duty--\n       (A) to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the use of a raw \n     material or component part in a medical device; and\n       (B) to warn consumers concerning the safety and \n     effectiveness of a medical device;\n       (14) attempts to impose the duties referred to in \n     subparagraphs (A) and (B) of paragraph (13) on suppliers of \n     the raw materials and component parts would cause more harm \n     than good by driving the suppliers to cease supplying \n     manufacturers of medical devices; and\n       (15) in order to safeguard the availability of a wide \n     variety of lifesaving and life-enhancing medical devices, \n     immediate action is needed--\n       (A) to clarify the permissible bases of liability for \n     suppliers of raw materials and component parts for medical \n     devices; and\n       (B) to provide expeditious procedures to dispose of \n     unwarranted suits against the suppliers in such manner as to \n     minimize litigation costs.\n\n     SEC. 203.

Mr. President, today is May 3, more than a month after \nthe law requires a budget resolution to be reported to the Senate for \ndebate. It is 18 days past April 15, when the law requires a budget \nresolution to have been completed and passed.\n  Yet, the Senate Budget Committee has not even begun to mark up a \nresolution. Instead, a scheduled markup has been delayed until May 8, \nso nothing will be done until then.\n  Yet, the current majority has inherited a budget from the last \nCongress in which the deficit is declining. Its task should be easier \nthan the task of the last Congress, which made the tough decisions that \nled to deficit decline.\n  Meanwhile, although our task in the last Congress was a harder one, \nand we achieved it with no Republican help, we did so within the \ndeadlines set by law.\n  Republicans campaigned on the claim that they could cut taxes, \nprotect defense spending, and balance the budget, all without touching \nSocial Security benefits. That was the message heard around the country \nall year last year. That was the message to which Americans responded: \nCut taxes, protect defense spending, and balance the budget, without \naffecting Social Security.\n  Now the time is already past for the first downpayment on that \npromise--the budget resolution required by law.\n  All we are hearing is the stirring sound of people changing the \nsubject. Republicans have discovered that the Medicare Program faces \nchallenges in the years ahead. Democrats told them and the Nation that \n2 years ago, when we shored up the Medicare Program and cut the \ndeficit, all without Republican votes.\n  Throughout the last 2 years, Republicans have rejected each and every \nproposal offered to help shore up the Medicare Program, with rhetoric \nabout reduced choices and higher taxes.\n  Now it is time to deliver. If Democratic solutions to the long-term \nproblems of an aging population are no good, let us hear Republican \nsolutions.\n  I fear we will not, because there are not any. The Republican \ndiscovery of a well-known fact is nothing but an effort to distract \nAmericans from their real intentions. House Republicans are considering \nreductions in Medicare growth on the order of $300 billion. Senate \nRepublicans have said they will need to reduce normal Medicare growth \nby $200 to $250 billion.\n  They all say they are not cutting, they are just reducing growth. But \nif a program grows because more people age and become eligible for it, \nit is pretty obvious that the same number of dollars will stretch a lot \nthinner.\n  Medicare program costs are increasing because all health insurance \ncosts are increasing. In fact, on a per capita basis, Medicare and \nMedicaid costs are increasing at the same rate as privately insured \ncosts. If Medicare growth rates are simply slashed--without reform--to \na rate of growth half as high, we know who is going to pay.\n  The seniors and working people and employers of this country will \npay, that is who. Hospitals and doctors will just shift costs to \nprivate insurers. The result will be a massive hidden tax on jobs, a \nmassive hidden tax hike on seniors and workers through hikes in \ncopayments and deductibles.\n  Cost sharing of the kind Republicans are now contemplating are not \njust likely to shift costs to the private sector. They are certain to \nshift costs to the private sector.\n\n[[Page S6129]]\n\n  It will be an invisible tax on the privately insured.\n  Some Republicans want to impose this invisible tax to pay for their \nvisible tax cut for the wealthy.\n  The budget figures and the rate of health care inflation show that \nMedicare can be preserved without massive cuts of the kind some are \nconsidering. They only reason they need to cut $300 billion from \nMedicare is because they plan to give away $354 billion at the same \ntime through a tax cut for the wealthy.\n  Americans will not be fooled by talk of bipartisan commissions. They \nwill not buy the ruse, where their retired parents' health care is cut \nway back and their own health care costs are exacerbated to quietly \nprovide tax breaks to the wealthiest people in the country.\n  If Medicare needs reform, it should be reformed in a way that ensures \nseniors will get the care they have been promised, and it should be \ndone in the context of health care reform. Medicare should not be cut \nblindly to achieve false savings--or worse, to fund a tax cut for those \nwho need it least.\n  The first step in this process must be for the majority to do what \nthey already should have done--propose a budget.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/05/03/senate-section/article/S6128-6", "month": "05", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "03", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6129]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n       SELLING THE POWER MARKETING ADMINISTRATIONS IS BAD POLICY\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, the administration's proposal to sell \nthree of the Nation's five power marketing administrations includes the \nWestern Area Power Administration, which markets power from the main \nstem dams on the Missouri River to South Dakota utilities and \ncooperatives.\n  As others have indicated, the sale of the power marketing \nadministrations or PMA's would result in an expected one-time savings \nof $3.7 billion. However, basing the decision on that fact alone is a \ncase of false economy.\n  PMA's return far more money to the Federal Government each year than \nthey cost to operate. In 1995, for example, the Western Area Power \nAdministration cost $225.1 million to operate, but returned $378.5 \nmillion to the Treasury. Other power marketing administrations showed \neven greater returns. And, beyond that, the sale is likely, ultimately, \nto increase electricity rates for consumers by up to 300 percent in \nsome areas.\n  This makes no sense.\n  Obviously, we need to reduce the budget deficit, and Democrats are \nready to do that. But we should not do it indiscriminately. Before we \nstart cutting Government programs, we have a responsibility to evaluate \ntheir utility and consider the consequences.\n  I am concerned that, in proposing this sale, proponents have fallen \nprey to the allure of short-term savings and missed the larger point \nthat power marketing administrations are good examples of exactly how \nGovernment should work.\n  It has been said that the purpose of Government is to do those things \nthat are essential but which we cannot do as individuals. That is \nexactly what the power marketing administrations do. They bring \naffordable electricity to communities that otherwise might not be able \nto afford it. And they do it cost-effectively.\n  I have heard the claims that the power marketing administrations can \nbe sold without causing substantial rate increases. Frankly, I'm \nskeptical of these claims.\n  In South Dakota, the Western Area Power Administration, or WAPA, \nmarkets power from the main stem dams along the Missouri River and has \nfor years ensured a consistent and affordable supply of electricity. \nThe program pays for itself.\n  If WAPA and the other PMA's are sold, rates are likely to increase \nsubstantially. That is because those with the deepest pockets--those in \nthe best position to purchase the assets--will be out-of-State \nfinancial interests, whose primary objective will be to maximize their \nreturn on investment.\n  Like any business, the buyers of PMA's will want to maximize their \nbottom line--profits. And electric rates for existing Federal power \ncustomers will rise as a result. Customers in South Dakota and other \nStates now served will pay much higher costs for power, with much of \nthe money going to out-of-State financial interests who bankroll these \npurchases.\n  Farming, ranching, and small businesses dominate the prairie economy, \nproviding modest incomes for most South Dakotans. The economic fate of \nour State or any other should not be placed in the hands of those whose \nonly interest is in making higher profits.\n  As you would expect, the proposal to sell the power marketing \nadministrations is unpopular in South Dakota and, I believe, in many \nother States as well.\n  I have received more than 10,000 letters from people opposed to the \nsale--and only two letters in favor of it. Ten thousand to two.\n  I believe that people generally know what is best for themselves. And \nwhen they speak this clearly, in such overwhelming numbers, Congress \nought to listen.\n  And let there be no mistake. The sale of the power marketing \nadministrations will have a negative effect far beyond the economy of \nSouth Dakota. PMA's sell power in 34 States across the country. I urge \nevery Member of this body to take a long look at the potential impacts \nof this sale on customers in his or her State. Read the fine print in \nthis proposal, and I believe you will see the folly in this idea.\n  In conclusion, Mr. President, PMA's work. Instead of selling them \noff, we should be holding them up as an example of how the Federal \nGovernment can work for the people and the national economy.\n  PMA's provide affordable power to States like South Dakota without \nany subsidy. The Federal Government gets a return on its investment. \nCustomers have access to reliable, affordable electricity.\n  What more can one ask of a program?\n  Like other States, South Dakota sacrificed great tracts of prime \nwildlife habitat and farmland so that dams could be constructed. \nSelling the PMA's now would deprive us of equitable compensation for \nthose sacrifices. Given that, and given the almost certain rate \nincreases that would result from the sale, as well as the likelihood of \nout-of-State ownership and, thus, the export of State resources, the \nsale of the PMA's is not a policy that I can support. I urge my \ncolleagues to join me in opposing this ill-conceived sale.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and, as I understand it, we are now \ngoing into recess.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/05/03/senate-section/article/S6129-1", "month": "05", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "03", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6129]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n       SELLING THE POWER MARKETING ADMINISTRATIONS IS BAD POLICY\n  Mr. DASCHLE.
