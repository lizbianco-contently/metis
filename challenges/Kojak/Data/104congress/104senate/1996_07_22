Mr. President, let me summarize where we are for \nSenators and staffers. We have used approximately 16 of the 20-hour \nstatutory time. Amendments can be offered and debated today between 10 \na.m. and 2 p.m. The amendments have to be on the general list of \namendments agreed to last Thursday.\n\n[[Page S8396]]\n\n  As of today, we will have disposed of over 23 amendments. We have had \n10 rollcall votes and 13 voice votes. As of Friday night, we have 15 \namendments pending for possible votes beginning tomorrow at 9:30, and \nwe could add to that list today as many as another 19 amendments. I am \nnot saying we will, but we could if all of those remaining on the \nagreed-on list that we agreed on Thursday night are offered today. So \nit is possible that beginning tomorrow we could have as many as 34 \nrollcall votes but certainly at least 20, not counting final passage.\n  It is my understanding that the distinguished Senator from Kentucky \n[Mr. Ford], is first. It is on that side.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The distinguished Democratic whip is \nrecognized.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4940\n\n(Purpose: To allow States the option to provide non-cash assistance to \nchildren after the 5-year time limit, as provided in report No. 104-430 \n (the conference report to H.R. 4 as passed during the lst session of \n                          the 104th Congress))\n\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask for \nits immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Kentucky [Mr. Ford] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 4940.\n\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 250, line 4, insert ``cash'' before ``assistance''.\n\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, this is an amendment that I think could \nalmost be accepted. Although we could not agree on the Breaux amendment \nof last week regarding noncash assistance for children, I hope we can \nagree on this one. One of the reasons welfare reform is so complicated \nis that it is usually hard to separate the adults on welfare from the \nchildren. Many want to get tougher on the adults, especially those who \nhave been on welfare for a long period of time. But I do not hear \nanyone who says get tougher on children. This amendment separates those \nissues because it is about how we as a Nation are ultimately \nresponsible for the welfare of our children.\n  Under the Republican bill, after 5 years, States may not use any \nFederal block grant money to assist families whatsoever. This applies \nto cash and noncash benefits as well. The current bill goes much \nfurther than H.R. 4, which passed Congress last year and was vetoed by \nthe President. In my view, this makes the bill much tougher on \nchildren. H.R. 4 prohibited cash assistance after 5 years. It did not \nprohibit noncash assistance like vouchers that could be used for \nclothing or medicine or other needs of our children.\n  My amendment makes this bill identical to H.R. 4 by allowing States \nto use Federal block grant funds to provide noncash assistance after \nadults on welfare have reached their 5-year limit.\n  If you favor State flexibility, you should support this amendment. \nSome supporters of this bill have said State flexibility is one of \ntheir top priorities, yet on this issue the bill is less flexible than \nH.R. 4. We say send this welfare reform back to the States, but yet we \nsay: States, do it the way we tell you to do it. That is not \nflexibility for the States.\n  The National Governors' Association supports this amendment. This \namendment does not increase the cost of the bill, nor add to the \ndeficit. It deals with how the Federal block grant funds allocated to \neach State may be used. And so, Mr. President, in a letter dated June \n26, 1996, the National Governors' Conference urged support for an \namendment to apply the time limit in the bill only to cash assistance.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a copy of this letter be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                               National Governors Association,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, June 26, 1996.\n     Senate Finance Committee,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Finance Committee Member: The nation's Governors \n     appreciate that S. 1795, as introduced, incorporated many of \n     the National Governors' Association's (NGA) recommendations \n     on welfare reform. NGA hopes that Congress will continue to \n     look to the Governors' bipartisan efforts on a welfare reform \n     policy and build on the lessons learned through a decade of \n     state experimentation in welfare reform.\n       However, upon initial review of the Chairman's mark, NGA \n     believes that many of the changes contained in the mark are \n     contradictory to the NGA bipartisan agreement. The mark \n     includes unreasonable modifications to the work requirement, \n     and additional administrative burdens, restrictions and \n     penalties that are unacceptable. Governors believe these \n     changes in the Chairman's mark greatly restrict state \n     flexibility and will result in increased, unfunded costs for \n     states, while at the same time undermining states ability to \n     implement effective welfare reform programs. These changes \n     threaten the ability of Governors to provide any support for \n     the revised welfare package, and may, in fact, result in \n     Governors opposing the bill.\n       As you mark up the welfare provisions of S. 1795, the \n     Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Act of 1996, NGA \n     strongly urges you to consider the recommendations contained \n     in the welfare reform policy adopted unanimously by the \n     nation's Governors in February. Governors believe that these \n     changes are needed to create a welfare reform measure that \n     will foster independence and promote responsibility, provide \n     adequate support for families that are engaged in work, and \n     accord states the flexibility and resources they need to \n     transform welfare into a transitional program leading to \n     work.\n       Below is a partial list of amendments that may be offered \n     during the committee markup and revisions included in the \n     Chairman's mark that are either opposed or supported by NGA. \n     This list is not meant to be exhaustive, and there may be \n     other amendments or revisions of interest or concern to \n     Governors that are not on this list. In the NGA welfare \n     reform policy, the Governors did not take a position on the \n     provisions related to benefits for immigrants, and NGA will \n     not be making recommendations on amendments in these areas. \n     As you mark up S. 1795, NGA urges you to consider the \n     following recommendations based on the policy statement of \n     the nation's Governors on welfare reform.\n\n\n      THE GOVERNORS URGE YOU TO SUPPORT THE FOLLOWING AMENDMENTS:\n\n       Support the amendment to permit states to count toward the \n     work participation rate calculation those individuals who \n     have left welfare for work for the first six months that they \n     are in the workforce (Breaux). The Governors believe states \n     should receive credit in the participation rate for \n     successfully moving people off of welfare and into \n     employment, thereby meeting one of the primary goals of \n     welfare reform. This will also provide states with an \n     incentive to expand their job retention efforts.\n       Support the amendment that applies the time limit only to \n     cash assistance (Breaux). S. 1795 sets a sixty-month lifetime \n     limit on any federally funded assistance under the block \n     grant. This would prohibit states from using the block grant \n     for important work supports such as transportation or job \n     retention counseling after the five-year limit. Consistent \n     with the NGA welfare reform policy, NGA urges you to support \n     the Breaux amendment that would apply the time limit only to \n     cash assistance.\n       Support the amendment to restore funding for the Social \n     Service Block Grant (Rockefeller). This amendment would limit \n     the cut in the Social Services Block Grant (SSBG) to 10 \n     percent rather than 20 percent. States use a significant \n     portion of their SSBG funds for child care for low-income \n     families. Thus, the additional cut currently contained in S. \n     1795 negates much of the increase in child care funding \n     provided under the bill.\n       Support technical improvements to the contingency fund \n     (Breaux). Access to additional matching funds is critical to \n     states during periods of economic recession. NGA supports two \n     amendments proposed by Senator Breaux. One clarifies the \n     language relating to maintenance of effort in the contingency \n     fund and another modifies the fund so states that access the \n     contingency fund during only part of the year are not \n     penalized with a less advantageous match rate.\n       Support the amendment to extend the 75 percent enhanced \n     match rate through fiscal 1997 for statewide automated child \n     welfare information systems (SACWIS), (Chafee, Rockefeller). \n     Although not specifically addressed in the NGA policy, this \n     extension is important for many states that are trying to \n     meet systems requirements that will strengthen their child \n     welfare and child protection efforts.\n       Governors urge you to oppose amendments or revisions to the \n     Chairman's mark that would limit state flexibility, create \n     unreasonable work requirements,impose new mandates, or \n     encroach on the ability of each state to direct resources and \n     design a welfare reform program to meet its unique needs.\n       In the area of work, Governors strongly oppose any efforts \n     to increase penalties, increase work participation rates, \n     further restrict what activities count toward the work \n     participation rate or change the hours of work required. The \n     Governors' policy included specific recommendations in these \n     areas, many of which were subsequently incorporated into S. \n     1795, as introduced. The recommendations reflect a careful \n     balancing of the goals of welfare reform, the availability of \n     resources, and the recognition that economic and demographic \n     circumstances differ among states. Imposing any additional \n     limitations or modifications to the work requirements would \n     limit state flexibility.\n\n[[Page S8397]]\n\nthe governors urge you to oppose the following amendments or revisions \n                          in the area of work\n\n       Oppose the revision in the Chairman's mark to increase the \n     number of hours of work required per week to thirty-five \n     hours in future years. NGA's recommendation that the work \n     requirement be set at twenty-five hours was incorporated into \n     S. 1795. Many states will set higher hourly requirements, but \n     this flexibility will enable states to design programs that \n     are consistent with local labor market opportunities and the \n     availability of child care.\n       Oppose the revision in the Chairman's mark to decrease to \n     four weeks the number of weeks that job search can count as \n     work. NGA supports the twelve weeks of job search contained \n     in S. 1795, as introduced. Job search has proven to be \n     effective when an individual first enters a program and also \n     after the completion of individual work components, such as \n     workfare or community service. A reduction to four weeks \n     would limit state flexibility to use this cost-effective \n     strategy to move recipients into work.\n       Oppose the revision in the Chairman's mark to increase the \n     work participation rates. NGA opposes any increase in the \n     work participation rates above the original S. 1795 \n     requirements. Many training and education activities that are \n     currently counted under JOBS will not count toward the new \n     work requirements. Consequently, states will face the \n     challenge of transforming their current JOBS program into a \n     program that emphasizes quick movement into the labor force. \n     An increase in the work rates will result in increased costs \n     to states for child care and work programs.\n       Oppose the revision in the Chairman's mark to increase \n     penalties for failure to meet the work participation \n     requirements. The proposed amendment to increase the penalty \n     by 5 percent for each consecutive failure to meet the work \n     rate is unduly harsh, particularly given the stringent nature \n     of the work requirements. Ironically, the loss of block grant \n     funds due to penalties will make it even more difficult for a \n     state to meet the work requirements.\n       Oppose the amendment requiring states to count exempt \n     families in the work participation rate calculation (Gramm). \n     This amendment would retain the state option to exempt \n     families with children below age one from the work \n     requirements but add the requirement that such families count \n     in the denominator for purposes of determining the work \n     participation rate. This penalizes states that grant the \n     exemption, effectively eliminating this option. The exemption \n     in S. 1795 is an acknowledgment that child care costs for \n     infants are very high and that there often is a shortage of \n     infant care.\n       Oppose the amendment to increase work hours by ten hours a \n     week for families receiving subsidized child care (Gramm). \n     This amendment would greatly increase child care costs as \n     well as impose a higher work requirement on families with \n     younger children, because families with other children--\n     particularly teenagers--are less likely to need subsidized \n     child care assistance.\n       Oppose the revision in the Chairman's mark to exempt \n     families with children below age eleven. S. 1795, as \n     introduced, prohibits states from sanctioning families with \n     children below age six for failure to participate in work if \n     failure to participate was because of a lack of child care. \n     This revision would raise the age to eleven. NGA is concerned \n     that this revision effectively penalizes states because they \n     still would be required to count these individuals in the \n     denominator of the work participation rate.\n\n\nthe governors urge you to oppose the following amendments or revisions \n            in the chairman's mark in these additional areas\n\n       Oppose the revision in the Chairman's mark to increase the \n     maintenance-of-effort requirement above the 75 percent in the \n     cash assistance block grant or further narrow the definition \n     of what counts toward maintenance-of-effort.\n       Oppose the revisions in the Chairman's mark that increase \n     state plan requirements and include additional state \n     penalties.\n       Oppose the amendment to limit hardship exemption to 15 \n     percent (Gramm). NGA policy supports the current provision in \n     S. 1795, as introduced, that allows states to exempt up to 20 \n     percent of their caseload from the five-year lifetime limit \n     on benefits.\n       Oppose the amendment to mandate that states provide in-kind \n     vouchers to families after a state or federal time limit on \n     benefits is triggered (Breaux, Moseley-Braun). NGA believes \n     that states should have the option to provide non-cash forms \n     of assistance after the time limit, but they should not be \n     mandated to do so.\n       Oppose the provision in the Chairman's mark to restrict the \n     transferability of funds out of the cash assistance block \n     grant to the child care block grant only. The Governors \n     believe that it is appropriate to allow a transfer of funds \n     into the foster care program or the Social Services Block \n     Grant.\n       Oppose a family cap mandate in the Chairman's mark. NGA \n     supports a family cap as an option, rather than a mandate, to \n     prohibit benefits to additional children born or conceived \n     while the parent is on welfare.\n       Governors urge you to consider the above recommendations.\n           Sincerely,\n                                             Raymond C. Scheppach.\n\n  Mr. FORD. The administration supports this amendment, Mr. President. \nIn a letter dated July 16, 1996, the acting OMB Director urges the \nadoption of voucher language that protects children.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a copy of this letter be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n         Executive Office of the President, Office of Management \n           and Budget,\n                                    Washington, DC, July 16, 1996.\n     Hon. John R. Kasich,\n     Chairman, Committee on the Budget, U.S. House of \n         Representatives, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: I am writing to transmit the \n     Administration's views on the welfare provisions of H.R. \n     3734, the ``Welfare and Medicaid Reform Act of 1996.'' We \n     understand that the Rules Committee plans to separate the \n     welfare and Medicaid portions of the bill and consider only \n     the welfare provisions on the House floor.\n       We are pleased that the Congress has decided to separate \n     welfare reform from a proposal to repeal Medicaid's guarantee \n     of health care for the elderly, poor, pregnant and people \n     with disabilities. We hope that removing this ``poison pill'' \n     from welfare reform is a breakthrough that indicates that the \n     Congressional leadership is serious about passing bipartisan \n     welfare reform this year.\n       It is among the Administration's highest priorities to \n     achieve bipartisan welfare reform reflecting the principles \n     of work, family, and responsibility. For the past three and a \n     half years, the President has demonstrated his commitment to \n     enacting real welfare reform by working with Congress to \n     create legislation that moves people from welfare to work, \n     encourages responsibility, and protects children. The \n     Administration sent to Congress a stand-alone welfare bill \n     that requires welfare recipients to work, imposes strict time \n     limits on welfare, toughens child support enforcement, is \n     fair to children, and is consistent with the President's \n     commitment to balance the budget.\n       The Administration is also pleased that the bill makes many \n     of the important improvements to H.R. 4 that we recommended--\n     improvements that were also included in the bipartisan \n     National Governors' Association and Castle-Tanner proposals. \n     We urge the Committee to build upon these improvements. At \n     the same time, however, the Administration is deeply \n     concerned about certain provisions of H.R. 3734 that would \n     adversely affect benefits for food stamp households and legal \n     immigrants, as well as with the need for strong State \n     accountability and flexibility. And, the bill would still \n     raise taxes on millions of working families by cutting the \n     Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC).\n\n\n                  improvements contained in H.R. 3734\n\n       We appreciate the Committees' efforts to strengthen \n     provisions that are central to work-based reform, such as \n     child care, and to provide some additional protections for \n     children and families. In rejecting H.R. 4, the President \n     singled out a number of provisions that were tough on \n     children and did too little to move people from welfare to \n     work. H.R. 3734 includes important changes to these \n     provisions that move the legislation closer to the \n     President's vision of true welfare reform. We are \n     particularly pleased with the following improvements:\n       Child Care. As the President has insisted throughout the \n     welfare reform debate, child care is essential to move people \n     from welfare to work. The bill reflects a better \n     understanding of the child care resources that States will \n     need to implement welfare reform, adding $4 billion for child \n     care above the level in H.R. 4. The bill also recognizes that \n     parents of school-age children need child care in order to \n     work and protect the health and safety of children in care.\n       Food Stamps. The bill removes the annual spending cap on \n     Food Stamps that was included in H.R. 4, preserving the \n     program's ability to expand during periods of economic \n     recession and help families when they are most in need.\n       Child Nutrition. The bill no longer includes the H.R. 4 \n     provisions for a child nutrition block-grant demonstration, \n     which would have undermined the program's ability to respond \n     automatically to economic changes and maintain national \n     nutrition standards.\n       Child Protection. We commend the Committee for preserving \n     the open-ended nature of Title IV-E foster care and adoption \n     assistance programs, current Medicaid coverage of eligible \n     children, and the national child data collection initiative.\n       Supplemental Security Income (SSI). The bill removes the \n     proposed two-tiered benefit system for disabled children \n     receiving SSI that was included in H.R. 4, and retains full \n     cash benefits for all eligible children.\n       Work Performance Bonus. We commend the Committee for giving \n     states an incentive to move people from welfare to work by \n     providing $1 billion in work performance bonuses by 2003. \n     This provision is an important element of the \n     Administration's bill, and will help change the culture of \n     the welfare office.\n       Contingency Fund. The bill adopts the National Governors \n     Association (NGA) recommendation to double the size of the \n     Contingency Fund to $2 billion, and add a more responsive \n     trigger based on the Food Stamp caseload changes. Further \n     steps the Congress should take to strengthen this provision \n     are outlined below.\n\n[[Page S8398]]\n\n       Hardship Exemption. We commend the Committee for following \n     the NGA recommendation and the Senate-passed welfare reform \n     bill by allowing states to exempt up to 20% of hardship cases \n     that reach the five-year time limit.\n       We remain pleased that Congress has decided to include \n     central elements of the President's approach--time limits, \n     work requirements, the toughest possible child support \n     enforcement, requiring minor mothers to live at home as a \n     condition of assistance--in this legislation.\n       The Administration strongly supports several provisions \n     included in S. 1795, as reported by the Senate Finance \n     Committee. These provisions include: allowing transfers only \n     to the child care block grant, increasing the maintenance of \n     effort requirement with a tightened definition of what counts \n     toward this requirement, improving the fair and equitable \n     treatment and enforcement language, and eliminating the child \n     protection block grant. We urge the Congress to include these \n     provisions in H.R. 3734.\n\n\n                      Key Concerns With H.R. 3734\n\n       The Administration however remains deeply concerned that \n     the bill still lacks other important provisions that have \n     earned bipartisan endorsement.\n       Size of the cuts. The welfare provisions incorporate most \n     of the cuts that were in the vetoed bill--$59 billion over 6 \n     years (including the EITC and related savings in Medicaid) \n     over six years. These cuts far exceed those proposed by the \n     NGA or the Administration. Cuts in Food Stamps and benefits \n     to legal immigrants are particularly deep. The President's \n     budget demonstrates that cuts of this size are not necessary \n     to achieve real welfare reform, nor are they needed to \n     balance the budget.\n       Food Stamps. The Administration strongly opposes the \n     inclusion of a Food Stamp block grant, which has the \n     potential to seriously undermine the Federal nature of the \n     program, jeopardizing the nutrition and health of millions of \n     children, working families, and the elderly, and eliminating \n     the program's ability to respond to economic changes. The \n     Administration is also concerned that the bill makes deep \n     cuts in the Food Stamp program, including a cut in benefits \n     to households with high shelter costs that disproportionately \n     affects families with children, and a four-month time limit \n     on childless adults who are willing to work, but are not \n     offered a work slot.\n       Legal Immigrants. The bill retains the excessively harsh \n     and uncompromising immigration provisions of last year's \n     vetoed bill. While we support the strengthening of \n     requirements on the sponsors of legal immigrants applying for \n     SSI, Food Stamps, and AFDC, the bill bans SSI and Food Stamps \n     for virtually all legal immigrants, and imposes a five-year \n     ban on all other Federal programs, including non-emergency \n     Medicaid, for new legal immigrants. These bans would even \n     cover legal immigrants who become disabled after entering the \n     country, families with children, and current recipients. The \n     bill would deny benefits to 0.3 million immigrant children \n     and would affect many more children whose parents are denied \n     assistance. The proposal unfairly shifts costs to States with \n     high numbers of legal immigrants. In addition, the bill \n     requires virtually all Federal, State, and local benefits \n     programs to verify recipients' citizenship or alien status. \n     These mandates would create significant administrative \n     burdens for State, local, and non-profit service providers, \n     and barriers to participation for citizens.\n       Medical Assistance Guarantee. Even after the proposed \n     removal of the Medicaid reconciliation provisions from H.R. \n     3734, the Administration opposes provisions that do not \n     guarantee continued Medicaid eligibility when States change \n     AFDC rules. Specifically, we are concerned that families who \n     reach the 5 year time limit or additional children born to \n     families that are already receiving assistance could lose \n     their Medicaid eligibility and would be unable to receive the \n     health care services that they need.\n       Protection in Economic Downturn. Although the contingency \n     fund is twice the size of that contained in the vetoed bill, \n     it still does not allow for further expansions during poor \n     economic conditions and periods of increased need. We are \n     also concerned about provisions that reduce the match rate on \n     contingency funds for states that access the fund for periods \n     of less than one year.\n       State Maintenance of Effort. Under H.R. 3437, States could \n     reduce the resources they provide to poor children. We are \n     deeply concerned that the bill provides the proposed cash \n     assistance block grant with transfer authority to the Social \n     Services Block Grant(SSBG). Transfers to SSBG could lead \n     States to substitute Federal dollars for State dollars in an \n     array of State social services activities, potentially \n     cutting the effective State maintenance of effort levels \n     required for the cash block grant.\n       Resources for Work. Based on Congressional Budget Office \n     (CBO) estimates, H.R. 3734 would leave states with a $9 \n     billion shortfall over six years in resources for work if \n     they maintained their current level of cash assistance. \n     Morever, the Economic and Educational Opportunity Committee \n     increased this shortfall and cut State flexibility by raising \n     the weekly number of hours that States must place recipients \n     in work activities and increasing the participation rates. \n     The Economic and Educational Opportunities amendments would \n     also create a shortfall in child care funding. As CBO has \n     noted, most states would probably accept block grant \n     penalties rather than meet the bill's participation rates and \n     truly refocus the system on work.\n       Vouchers. The bill actually reduces State flexibility by \n     prohibiting States from using block grant funds to provide \n     vouchers to children whose parents reach the time limit. H.R. \n     4 contained no such prohibition, and the NGA opposes it. We \n     strongly urge the adoption of the voucher language that \n     protects children similar to that in the Administration's \n     bill and Castle-Tanner.\n       Worker Displacement. We are deeply concerned that the bill \n     does not include adequate protections against worker \n     displacement. Workers are not protected from partial \n     displacement such as reduction in hours, wages, or benefits, \n     and the bill does not establish any avenue for displaced \n     employees to seek redress.\n       Family Caps. The House bill reverts back to the opt-out \n     provision on family caps which would restrict State \n     flexibility in this area. The Administration, as well as NGA, \n     seeks complete State flexibility to set family cap policy.\n       EITC. The Administration opposes the provisions in H.R. \n     3734 that increase the EITC phase-out rates thereby raising \n     taxes on more than four million low-income working families, \n     with seven million children. In addition, the budget \n     resolution instructs the revenue committees to cut up to \n     $18.5 billion more from the EITC. Thus, EITC cuts could total \n     over $2 billion, and such large increases on working families \n     are particularly ill-conceived when considered in the context \n     of real welfare reform--that is, encouraging work and making \n     work pay.\n       We are also concerned that the bill repeals the Family \n     Preservation and Support program, which may mean less State \n     spending on abuse and neglect prevention activities.\n       We strongly support the bipartisan welfare reform \n     initiatives from moderate Republicans and Democrats in both \n     Houses of Congress. The Castle-Tanner proposal addresses many \n     of our concerns, and it would strengthen State accountability \n     efforts, welfare to work measures, and protections for \n     children. It provides a foundation on which this Committee \n     should build in order to provide more State flexibility, \n     incentives for AFDC recipients to move from welfare to work; \n     more parental responsibility; and protections for children. \n     It is a good strong bill that would end welfare as we know \n     it. Castle-Tanner provides the much needed opportunity for a \n     real bipartisan compromise and should be the basis for a \n     quick agreement between the parties.\n       The President stands ready to work with the Congress to \n     address the outstanding concerns so that we can enact a \n     strong bipartisan welfare reform bill to replace the current \n     system with one that demands responsibility, strengthens \n     families, protects children, and gives States broad \n     flexibility and the needed resources to get the job done.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                     Jacob J. Lew,\n                                                  Acting Director.\n\n  Mr. FORD. As I have stated, my amendment makes the bill identical to \nH.R. 4. If we are serious about passing a welfare reform bill \nacceptable to both the Congress and the administration, why should we \nallow this bill to be even tougher on children than H.R. 4 which the \nPresident vetoed?\n  Mr. President, the American Public Welfare Association also supports \nthis amendment. I ask unanimous consent that a copy of a June 26, 1996, \nletter from APWA be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                                   American Public\n\n\n                                          Welfare Association,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, June 26, 1996.\n       Dear Senator: As the Senate Finance Committee considers \n     amendments to S. 1795, the Personal Responsibility and Work \n     Opportunity Act of 1996, the American Public Welfare \n     Association (APWA) urges your commitment to increased state \n     flexibility in the design and implementation of welfare \n     programs in light of the promising reform efforts underway in \n     states throughout the country. Listed below are amendments \n     that may be offered during the Committee's consideration of \n     S. 1795. In accordance with the policies adopted by the APWA, \n     we urge your support or opposition to the following \n     amendments:\n\n\n                         amendments to support\n\n       Calculation of Work Participation Rate (Breaux): An \n     amendment to count clients who leave welfare for work in the \n     work participation rate calculation. States would be \n     permitted to count their participation for the first 6 months \n     they are engaged in at least 25 hours of work per week in a \n     private sector job. APWA strongly supports this amendment to \n     credit states with successfully moving welfare clients off \n     welfare and into private sector employment.\n       Child Welfare Information Systems (Chafee/Rockefeller): An \n     amendment to extend the enhanced match rate of 75% for \n     federal fiscal year 1997 for the statewide automated child \n     welfare information systems (SACWIS). APWA strongly supports \n     continued funding for SACWIS systems which are critical to \n     improving child welfare services.\n       Title XX Reductions (Rockefeller): An amendment to reduce \n     the proposed 20 percent cut in the Social Services Block \n     Grant\n\n[[Page S8399]]\n\n     (Title XX) to 10 percent. APWA urges the adoption of this \n     amendment to reduce cuts in the Title XX Block Grant which \n     states use to provide critical supportive work and family \n     services.\n\n\n                         amendments to support\n\n       Contingency Fund (Breaux): An amendment to clarify the \n     calculation of state maintenance of effort in the contingency \n     fund. APWA strongly supports this clarification of qualified \n     state expenditures for the purpose of calculating state \n     maintenance of effort.\n       Contingency Fund (Breaux): An amendment to modify the \n     contingency fund to provide that states which access \n     contingency fund during only part of the year are not \n     penalized. APWA strongly supports this amendment to ensure \n     that states do not have their federal match rate for \n     contingency funds reduced if these states only require funds \n     for part of the year.\n       Child Welfare Services (Chafee): An amendment to retain \n     current law that makes alien children, who do not qualify for \n     AFDC, eligible for IV-E foster care and adoption assistance \n     if they meet the other eligibility requirements. APWA policy \n     supports current law for Title IV-E or its optional block \n     grant proposal for this program. Consistent with this policy, \n     APWA supports retaining this particular provision in current \n     law that has been omitted in the bill.\n       Five Year Time Limit (Breaux): An amendment to provide \n     states with the flexibility to use Temporary Assistance to \n     Needy Family (TANF) block grant funds as in-kind assistance \n     to children of families which have reached the 5 year \n     lifetime time limit.\n\n\n                          amendments to oppose\n\n       Work Exemption (Conrad): An amendment to exempt single \n     parents with children under age 11 who cannot find child care \n     from the penalties for refusing to meet work requirements. \n     APWA opposes this amendment because it would exempt single \n     adults from work requirements, yet financially penalizes \n     states for failure to meet the bills work participation \n     rates.\n       Increased Hours of Work (Pressler): An amendment to \n     increase hours of work required per week. APWA opposes this \n     amendment because it fails to provide additional funds for \n     the provision of child care services needed to meet increased \n     hours of work.\n\n\n                          amendments to oppose\n\n       Decreased Job Search (Pressler): An amendment to decrease \n     the number of weeks job search activities can count towards \n     the work participation rate. APWA supports job search as a \n     valid work activity that should count toward work \n     participation.\n       Increase work participation rate (Pressler): An amendment \n     to increase work participation rates contained in the bill. \n     APWA opposes this amendment because it fails to provide \n     additional funds for placement, child care and other \n     supportive work services needed to meet increased work \n     participation rates.\n       Work Participation Rate Penalties (Gramm): An amendment to \n     impose an additional 5 percent penalty on states for \n     consecutive failure to meet the work participation \n     requirements. APWA opposes this amendment to increase \n     penalties on states beyond those contained in the bill.\n       Work Participation Rate (Gramm): An amendment to limit to \n     one year the exception to the work participation rate \n     calculation for families with children under 1 year of age.\n       Exemption (Gramm): An amendment to allow states to exempt \n     families with children under 1 year of age from the work \n     requirement, but require that such exempt families count for \n     purposes of determining the work participation rate. APWA \n     opposes this amendment because it would exempt single adults \n     from work requirements, yet financially penalizes states for \n     failure to meet the bills work participation rates.\n       Work Requirement (Gramm): An amendment to increase the work \n     requirement on families if they receive federally funded \n     child care assistance by: 1) 10 additional hours a week for a \n     single parents and b) 30 hours per week for the nonworking \n     spouse in a two-parent family. APWA opposes this amendment \n     because it fails to recognize the additional funds required \n     for placement, child care and other supportive work services \n     needed to meet increased work requirements.\n       Paternity Establishment (Gramm): An amendment to strengthen \n     the requirements for paternity establishment as a condition \n     for receiving benefits, with a state option to exempt as much \n     as 25% of the population. APWA believes states should have \n     the option to impose this requirement, but it should not be a \n     mandate.\n       Hardship Exemption (Gramm): An amendment to limit the \n     hardship exemption from the five year lifetime time limit to \n     15 percent from the 20 percent exemption in S. 1795. APWA \n     supports the hardship exemption of at least 20 percent of the \n     entire caseload.\n       Thank you for your consideration of these APWA positions. \n     If you have any questions, please feel free to contact me or \n     Elaine Ryan at (202) 682-0100.\n           Sincerely,\n                                            A. Sidney Johnson III,\n                                               Executive Director.\n\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, we can keep the restriction on cash \nassistance after 5 years, but let us not take a step backward and \nprohibit all forms of noncash assistance. This prohibition is aimed \ndirectly at our children, and I think it is misguided.\n  If we want a welfare reform compromise, if we want to avoid being \nunnecessarily harsh on our children, if we want to maximize State \nflexibility, we should pass this amendment. It is supported by the \nNational Governors' Association, and it makes the bill identical to \nH.R. 4, which passed the Congress last year. It does not add to the \ncost of the bill and it promotes State flexibility.\n  During the conference last year, the Governors lobbied hard for this \nparticular amendment. I know none of my colleagues take these decisions \nlightly, but I hope you will remember that each one of us will be \nforever wedded to these decisions. We are essentially providing a road \nmap for the future, the futures of hundreds of thousands of children in \nthis country. Make no mistake about it, 5 or 10 or 15 years from now, \nwhen these children have become young adults, you and I must take some \nresponsibility for their successes or failures.\n  Of course, they will have their setbacks, just like you and me. But \nlet us assure that those setbacks are not set in motion by the \ndecisions we make today. By passing this amendment, I believe one day \neach of us can look at our future parents, doctors, lawyers, farmers \nand teachers, taking pride in our role to assure they grew up with a \nsafe place to sleep at night, clothes on their backs, and food in their \nstomachs.\n  If we fail to pass this amendment, the children who become trapped in \nlives of mediocrity or fall through the cracks to obscurity will belong \nto us as well.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent a letter from my Governor in \nKentucky, who is now part of the leadership of the National Governors' \nAssociation, supporting this amendment be printed in the Record at this \npoint.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                         Commonwealth of Kentucky,\n\n\n                                       Office of the Governor,\n\n                                     Frankfort, KY, July 18, 1996.\n     Hon. Wendell Ford,\n     Russell Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Ford: As the Senate begins its welfare debate \n     this week, I understand you plan to offer an amendment that \n     would allow states to use federal block grant funds to \n     provide non-cash assistance to the children of welfare \n     families, after a family has reached the proposed five-year \n     lifetime limit on benefits. I am writing to offer my full \n     support of that amendment.\n       Welfare has always been a federal-state partnership and \n     responsibility. The federal government must continue to \n     assist states' efforts to support children of welfare \n     parents. To abandon these children after any amount of time \n     is a horrible breach of this partnership and adds up to \n     nothing but an over-burdensome unfunded mandate on the \n     states. As a nation, we have committed ourselves to \n     protecting the lives and well-being of the innocent. In this \n     case, we are talking about the most innocent of all--our \n     children.\n       Any welfare reform legislation must include provisions to \n     move recipients to work. I support a tough and responsible \n     approach that makes welfare recipients work and urges them to \n     move off the program. However, any welfare reform must also \n     continue to provide a safety net for those recipients' \n     children. These children have no control over the direction \n     of their young lives.\n       It is also conceivable that in a span of 20-30 years, a \n     hard working family trying to carry their own weight in our \n     society and provide for their families could fall on hard \n     times during downturns in the economy. It would be \n     particularly unfortunate to punish these families who are \n     attempting to contribute to society but who from time to time \n     need limited assistance.\n       Therefore, I fully support your amendment to insure the \n     federal government does not shirk its responsibility to our \n     children and lay an inappropriate fiscal burden on the \n     states. You will find that other governors across the nation \n     will also support this action. The National Governors' \n     Association, in a June 26 letter to Congress, expressed its \n     support for the content included in this amendment. Congress \n     should defer to this bipartisan support from the nation's \n     governors. After all, it is we governors who will be charged \n     with implementing any national welfare reform program.\n       Thank you and please contact me if I can be of any further \n     assistance on this matter.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   Paul E. Patton.\n\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, the Catholic Bishops' Conference supports \nthis amendment. I ask unanimous consent a letter from the Catholic \nBishops' Conference in support of my amendment be printed in the \nRecord.\n\n[[Page S8400]]\n\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                     U.S. Catholic Conference,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, July 17, 1996.\n       Dear Senator: The Catholic Bishops' Conference has long \n     suggested genuine welfare reform that strengthens families, \n     encourages productive work, and protects vulnerable children. \n     We believe genuine welfare reform is an urgent national \n     priority, but we oppose abandonment of the federal \n     government's necessary role in helping families overcome \n     poverty and meet their children's basic needs. Simply cutting \n     resources and transferring responsibility is not genuine \n     reform.\n       As Chairman of the Domestic Policy Committee of the United \n     States Catholic Conference, I share the goals of reducing \n     illegitimacy and dependency, promoting work and empowering \n     families. However, I am writing to you to express our concern \n     about provisions in S 1795, (Senate Budget Committee's \n     Reconciliation report S 1956), which would result in more \n     poverty, hunger and illness for poor children. As the Senate \n     considers this bill, we strongly urge you to support \n     amendments in five essential areas.\n\n\n                             (1) family cap\n\n       We urge the Senate to support efforts to remove the family \n     cap which denies increased assistance for additional children \n     born to mothers on welfare unless state law repeals it. See \n     the attached briefing sheet on why the ``opt out'' is \n     effectively a mandatory cap which the Senate rejected on a \n     bipartisan basis 66-34. We urge the Senate again to reject \n     this measure which will encourage abortions and hurt \n     children.\n       We believe the so-called ``opt-out'' provision is, in \n     reality, a federally mandated family cap because it can only \n     be removed by the unprecedented and extreme requirement that \n     both houses of a state legislative pass and the Governor sign \n     a law repealing the federal mandate. The Bishops' \n     Conference's opposition to the family cap is based on the \n     belief that children should not be denied benefits because of \n     their mothers' age or dependence on welfare. These \n     provisions, whatever their intentions, are likely to \n     encourage abortion, especially in those states which pay for \n     abortions, but not for assistance to these children. These \n     states say to a young woman, we will pay for your abortion, \n     but we will not help you to raise your child in dignity.\n       New Jersey is the state with the most experience with a \n     family cap. In May 1995, New Jersey welfare officials \n     announced that the abortion rate among poor women increased \n     3.6% in the eight months after New Jersey barred additional \n     payments to women on welfare who gave birth to additional \n     children. This increase is exactly what pro-life opponents of \n     the family cap predicted. A study conducted by Rutgers \n     University also has shown that the New Jersey law barring \n     additional payments to welfare mothers who have more children \n     has not affected birthrates significantly among those women. \n     The study refutes several earlier announcements that \n     birth rates among New Jersey welfare mothers had dropped \n     dramatically since the state implemented the policy in \n     1992. While state officials recently reported a drop in \n     the birth rate among welfare mothers, officials are wary \n     of linking this deline with imposition of the family cap.\n       Although these results are prelimary, the abortion increase \n     coupled with the absence of an association between the family \n     cap and birth rates suggest that the policy of denying \n     children benefits doesn't do much to reduce illegitimate \n     births except by increasing abortions.\n       On a related matter, we support efforts to assure that teen \n     parents are offered the education, training and supervision \n     necessary for them to become good parents and productive \n     adults. We also believe that teen parents should be \n     discouraged from setting up independent households and \n     endorsed this approach in our own statement on welfare \n     reform.\n\n\n                        (2) National Safety Net\n\n       We urge the Senate to permit states to provide vouchers or \n     cash payments for the needs of children after the time limits \n     have been reached. The Senate bill cuts off all assistance \n     after two consecutive years on welfare and five years in a \n     lifetime, regardless of the efforts of the family or the \n     needs of children.\n       We support more creative and responsive federal-state-\n     community partnership, but we cannot support destruction of \n     the social safety net which will make it more difficult for \n     poor children to grow into productive individuals. We cannot \n     support reform that destroys the structures, ends \n     entitlements, and eliminates resources that have provided an \n     essential safety net for vulnerable children or permits \n     states to reduce their commitment in these areas. Society has \n     a responsibility to help meet the needs of those who cannot \n     care for themselves especially young children. In the absence \n     of cash benefits, vouchers would provide essential support \n     for poor children.\n\n\n                         (3) Food and Nutrition\n\n       We urge the Senate to remove the optional state block grant \n     and reduce the cuts in food stamps. The Senate bill cuts more \n     than $25 billion in food assistance to poor children and \n     families, permits a state block grant of the federal food \n     stamp program, and cuts single adults (18-50) from food \n     stamps even if they have made every effort to find a job or a \n     training slot.\n       We cannot support ``reform'' that eliminates resources that \n     have provided an essential safety net for vulnerable families \n     and children. Over half the cuts in this bill are in the Food \n     Stamp program. These cuts will likely create an even greater \n     burden on children and families when coupled with other \n     changes called for in this bill. The optional food stamp \n     block grant also troubles us. These fixed payments will make \n     it difficult for states to respond to increased need in times \n     of economic downturns.\n\n\n                      (4) Earned Income Tax Credit\n\n       We urge the Senate to reduce the cuts in the EITC. S 1795, \n     as passed by the Finance Committee, includes $5 billion in \n     EITC cuts, nearly 40% coming from the credit for low-income \n     working families without significant assets. These reductions \n     would affect nearly five million families with children.\n       We support real welfare reform which leads to productive \n     work with wages and benefits that permit a family to live in \n     dignity. Real jobs at decent wages, and tax policies like an \n     effective Earned Income Tax Credit [EITC], can help keep \n     families off welfare.\n\n\n                          (4) Legal Immigrants\n\n       We urge the Senate to permit legal immigrants to receive \n     essential benefits and at the very least to receive health \n     care through Medicaid. The Senate bill denies assistance to \n     all legal immigrants in ``means-tested programs'' (i.e., \n     AFDC, Medicaid, Food Stamps). We urge the Senate to reject \n     this unfair provision and, at least, substitute the less \n     punitive restrictions contained in the recently passed \n     Immigration bill (i.e., permit Medicaid assistance, etc.).\n       We cannot support punitive approaches that target \n     immigrants, including legal residents, and take away the \n     minimal benefits that they now receive. The provisions in the \n     Immigration and Reform Act of 1995 [H.R.2202] would at least \n     leave fewer families and children without essential health \n     care and cash supports, even though these provisions go \n     beyond what the bishops would support.\n       In summary, we urge you to support genuine welfare reform, \n     not this legislation which simply reduces resources and \n     reallocates responsibilities without adequately protecting \n     children and helping families overcome poverty. Without \n     substantial changes, this legislation falls short of the \n     criteria for welfare reform articulated by the nation's Roman \n     Catholic bishops and we urge you to oppose it.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                     Rev. William S. Skylstad,\n\n                                                Bishop of Spokane,\n                                 Chair, Domestic Policy Committee.\n\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, the Catholic Conference of Kentucky has \nwritten a letter endorsing and supporting my amendment. I ask unanimous \nconsent it be printed in the Record also.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                              Catholic Conference of Kentucky,\n\n                                     Frankfort, KY, July 19, 1996.\n     Senator Wendell Ford,\n     Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Ford: As you are well aware from previous \n     correspondence with the Catholic Conference of Kentucky, the \n     Bishops have major concerns about the welfare reform \n     legislation which passed the House on Thursday. The United \n     States Catholic Conference Office of Government Liaison has \n     informed staff that the Senate is expected to take this up \n     immediately. On behalf of the Bishops, I'd like to touch upon \n     key issues with you.\n       The Family Cap, which your voting record has been perfect \n     on, will prohibit states from using federal funds to provide \n     cash assistance to children born to current welfare \n     recipients. The ``opt-out'' provision is virtually a federal \n     mandatory cap. We ask you to continue to support removing \n     this prohibition on Kentucky's use of federal funds for \n     Kentucky's children.\n       The Social Safety Net would no longer exist as this bill \n     ends the guarantee of basic assistance to poor children and \n     families. Please support any amendments which would allow \n     Kentucky to meet their needs through continued support either \n     as cash payments or vouchers when they reach the time limit.\n       The Food Stamp program would experience massive spending \n     reductions. Please support any amendments to remove the \n     optional food stamp block grant and ease the harshness of the \n     provision which terminates food stamps to individuals, 18 to \n     50 years old, who cannot find work.\n       Legal Immigrants would be denied benefits when, despite \n     their contributions through work and taxes, they fall on hard \n     times. Please support any amendments which would permit legal \n     immigrants to receive benefits and, at the very least, to \n     receive health care though Medicaid.\n       We know that the debate will be heated and the rhetoric \n     will flow, but we know that Kentuckians can look to their \n     Senior Senator for balance. Thanks so much for your \n     consideration of these matters and for all that you do for us \n     in Washington, D.C. Please do not hesitate to call if you \n     have questions concerning any of this. See you at Fancy Farm!\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   Jane J. Chiles.\n\n  Mr. FORD. So, Mr. President, I think this amendment moves us closer \nto compromise. I urge the adoption of my amendment. As I said earlier, \nthis is\n\n[[Page S8401]]\n\none that ought to be accepted. The distinguished former Governor of New \nHampshire, on the floor of the Senate last week said, as it related to \nthe Breaux amendment, he did not like the first half, but the second \nhalf of the amendment he liked very much, which is basically the \namendment I offered here today.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The distinguished chairman of the Budget \nCommittee is recognized.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, as I understand it, nothing we are doing \nhere today precludes us from raising a point of order on this \namendment?\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. If one lies. We are not sure at this point. We are \ngoing to go see if it does.\n  Mr. FORD. If I may say to my friend, Mr. President, the point of \norder would lie against the Breaux amendment. But in talking with the \nParliamentarian and others, this particular amendment would not have a \npoint of order against it. I hope the Senator would not do that.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. We are not going to do that unless it lies. If it lies, \nwe will do that.\n  Mr. FORD. Fine. Let us find out.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Let me say, the arguments have been made more \neloquently than I can make them. As I understand it, tomorrow, when \nthis matter comes up for a vote, we will each have a minute to respond. \nI think I will not respond at this point other than to say clearly \nthere are benefits beyond the cash assistance benefit that is being \nmodified here. That program called AFDC, the cash assistance, we are \ntrying to terminate that as a way of life after 5 years. That does not \nmean that other programs that assist people who are poor, including \npoor children, are terminated by this bill. So voucher-type programs in \nthe housing area and others are still going to be available.\n  The question is, Do you want to break the cycle of dependency in this \nbasic AFDC Program at 5 years, or do you want to break that and then \nstart up another one? That is the issue. Do you want to start up a \nwhole new bureaucracy of vouchers and the like, or do you want to break \nthat dependency and get on with changing the very culture of the \nwelfare system.\n  I think part of that is what this amendment addresses. We will have \nto decide as a Senate what we want to do about that.\n  I yield back any time I have in opposition to the amendment at this \npoint. I assume the Senator is going to yield his back shortly, I say \nto my colleague?\n  Mr. FORD. Yes, I will.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The distinguished Democratic whip is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, flexibility by the Governors of the various \nStates, I think, is very important. Regarding the Governors who will be \nresponsible for this, their association has asked they be allowed to do \nthis without being cut off.\n  Last week they said this amendment would be unnecessary because \nStates can already use title XX money, the social services block grant, \nto fund these vouchers. Social services block grant, title XX, is \nsimply inadequate to meet those needs. Title XX has been funded at \nessentially the same level since 1991. There is a greater demand on \nthese funds today than ever before.\n  Title XX funds are used to provide--now listen to this--title XX \nfunds are used to provide aid to the homebound elderly. What the \nopponents of this amendment are saying to States is: Choose between \nyour homebound elderly and your poorest children, but do not expect any \nState flexibility to use your welfare block grant. That is what they \nare saying.\n  I have never seen and heard people being against poor children as I \nhave heard for the last several days. Everyone says to Governors, to \nwhom we want to give flexibility and give this block grant to, that you \ncannot have flexibility with children. It just does not make sense. I \nhave been a Governor. We have had hard times. My State is one of the \nStates that has not asked for a waiver. Our welfare rolls are down 23 \npercent. It is because of the economy, basically. We still have about \n14 or 15 counties that are in double-digit unemployment. They have \nproblems.\n  What if we have an economic downturn? We are going to need all the \nflexibility in the States we can have. But we come here and listen, day \nafter day after day: ``There are other programs you can use. You can \nuse title XX,'' the Republicans said last week. But that is aid to the \nhomebound elderly. Are you going to force a Governor to make the \ndecision between the homebound elderly and our poorest children? Do not \nexpect any State flexibility to use your welfare block grant, Governor.\n  Title XX block grants are also used for preventing or remedying \nneglect, abuse, exploitation of children unable to protect their own \ninterests, like preventing or reducing inappropriate institutional care \nby providing community-based or home-based care, or other alternatives. \nThat is title XX.\n  Why not give the Governors and the States the flexibility they are \nasking for? All we are doing is just returning this bill to the same \nposition as H.R. 4, in the last session, that most people on the other \nside voted for.\n  Now we say, ``Oh, they've got other places.'' This bill allows States \nto exempt 20 percent of the welfare rolls, it does not count time spent \non welfare as a minor--it allows all these things. But after 5 years, \nyou are through. Period.\n  If you are going to give them the welfare block grant, they ought to \nhave an opportunity. It is just beyond me, after you work your heart \nout to try to eliminate poverty in your State and your counties and \nyour cities and you know what needs to be done, that we say up here, \nfor sound bites--sound bites--we are going to give it back to the \nStates, but we are going to tell the States how to do it. That does not \nmake sense to a former Governor. It does not make sense. If you are \ngoing to put the responsibility on my back, if you are going to put the \nresponsibility on a Governor somewhere, give him the ability to make \ndecisions and not strip him of that ability, do not keep him in a box \nwhere he cannot reach out and help children.\n  That is all I am asking for, Mr. President, is the ability of a \nGovernor to have flexibility to use the money that we send to him, and \nit will be shorter than it is this year. Do not kid yourself about \ntitle XX. It has not been increased in 5 years. It is the same amount \nof money, and we are growing--more people. The percentage of elderly is \ngrowing every year, but we are not sending any more money. It is the \nsame amount. It has been level, it has been flat for 5 years, and they \nsay, take it out of title XX, take it out of homebound elderly, and \ngive it to the poorest of children? That is a heck of a choice to give \nto an individual who has the responsibility of leading his State.\n  So, Mr. President, I hope that my colleagues will join with me in \nsaying to those Governors out there, ``We're going to give you a very \nheavy load to carry, and that load is trying to work out welfare reform \nand make it work in your State.'' Let's not handcuff him or her. Let's \ngive him or her the flexibility to do what is in the best interest, \nparticularly for children.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. DOMENICI addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The distinguished chairman of the Budget \nCommittee.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  I gather now, under previous arrangements, Senator Ashcroft is going \nto offer an amendment. Mr. President, is the Senator ready?\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Yes, I am.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The junior Senator from Missouri is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. FORD. Will the Senator yield for 10 seconds? I apologize for \nthis.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. No problem at all.\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator Reid be \nadded as a cosponsor of my amendment.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. FORD. I thank the Senator from Missouri.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The able Senator from Missouri is \nrecognized.\n\n[[Page S8402]]\n\n                           Amendment No. 4941\n\n(Purpose: To provide that a family may not receive TANF assistance for \nmore than 24 consecutive months at a time unless an adult in the family \n is working or a State exempts an adult in the family from working for \nreasons of hardship, and that a family may not receive TANF assistance \n if the family includes an adult who fails to ensure that their minor \ndependent children attend school or such adult does not have, or is not \n   working toward attaining, a high school diploma or its equivalent)\n\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk for \nconsideration.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Missouri [Mr. Ashcroft] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 4941.\n\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       Strike section 408(a)(8) of the Social Security Act, as \n     added by section 2103(a)(1), and insert the following:\n       (8) No assistance for more than 5 years; for failure to \n     ensure minor dependent children are in school; or for failing \n     to have or work toward a high school diploma or its \n     equivalent.--\n       (A) In general.--Except as provided in subparagraphs (B) \n     and (C), a State to which a grant is made under section 403 \n     shall not use any part of the grant to provide assistance--\n       (i) to a family that includes an adult who has received \n     assistance under any State program funded under this part \n     attributable to funds provided by the Federal Government--\n       (I) for 60 months (whether or not consecutive) after the \n     date the State program funded under this part commences; or\n       (II) for more than 24 consecutive months after the date the \n     State program funded under this part commences unless such \n     adult is engaged in work as required by section \n     402(a)(1)(A)(ii) or exempted by the State by reason of \n     hardship pursuant to subparagraph (C); or,\n       (ii) to a family that includes an adult who has received \n     assistance under any State program funded under this part \n     attributable to funds provided by the Federal Government or \n     under the food stamp program, as defined in section 3(h) of \n     the Food Stamp Act of 1977, unless such adult ensures that \n     the minor dependent children of such adult attend school as \n     required by the law of the State in which the minor children \n     reside; or,\n       (iii) to a family that includes an adult who is older than \n     age 20 and younger than age 51 who has received assistance \n     under any State program funded under this part attributable \n     to funds provided by the Federal Government or under the food \n     stamp program, as defined in section 3(h) of the Food Stamp \n     Act of 1977, if such adult does not have, or is not working \n     toward attaining, a secondary school diploma or its \n     recognized equivalent unless such adult has been determined \n     in the judgment of medical, psychiatric, or other appropriate \n     professionals to lack the requisite capacity to complete \n     successfully a course of study that would lead to a secondary \n     school diploma or its recognized equivalent.\n       (B) minor child exception.--In determining the number of \n     months for which an individual who is a parent or pregnant \n     has received assistance under the State program funded under \n     this part for purposes of subparagraph (A)(i), the State \n     shall disregard any month for which such assistance was \n     provided with respect to the individual and during which the \n     individual was--\n       (i) a minor child; and\n       (ii) not the head of a household or married to the head of \n     a household.\n       (C) Hardship exception.--\n       (i) In general.--The State may exempt a family from the \n     application of subparagraph (A) of this paragraph, or \n     subparagraph (B) of paragraph (1), by reason of hardship or \n     if the family includes an individual who has been battered or \n     subjected to extreme cruelty.\n       (ii) Limitation.--The number of families with respect to \n     which an exemption made by a State under clause (i) is in \n     effect for a fiscal year shall not exceed 20 percent of the \n     average monthly number of families to which assistance is \n     provided under the State program funded under this part.\n       (iii) Battered or subject to extreme cruelty defined.--For \n     purposes of clause (i), an individual has been battered or \n     subjected to extreme cruelty if the individual has been \n     subjected to--\n       (I) physical acts that resulted in, or threatened to result \n     in, physical injury to the individual;\n       (II) sexual abuse;\n       (III) sexual activity involving a dependent child;\n       (IV) being forced as the caretaker relative of a dependent \n     child to engage in nonconsensual acts or activities;\n       (V) threats of, or attempts at, physical or sexual abuse;\n       (VI) mental abuse; or\n       (VII) neglect or deprivation of medical care.\n       (D) Rule of interpretation.--Subparagraph (A)(i) of this \n     paragraph and subparagraph (B) of paragraph (1) shall not be \n     interpreted to require any State to provided assistance to \n     any individual for any period of time under the State program \n     funded under this part.\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I say to the Senator from Missouri, do \nwe have a copy of the Senator's amendment?\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. The Senator will be pleased to send a copy of the \namendment to the Senator from New Mexico.\n  The Senator from Missouri inquires, should we be operating under a \ntime agreement here?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. We do not have to. I know of no other Senator prepared \nto offer an amendment. Take as much time as you like. You are entitled \nto an hour.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. I am sure we will be able to accomplish what we need to \naccomplish in substantially less time.\n  Mr. President, thank you for this opportunity to offer an amendment. \nI believe that it is important for us in this Congress, and in the bill \nwhich is before the Senate, to change the character of welfare. That is \nthe challenge which is before us. We have to change a system which has \nprovided people with a condition--a condition of dependence, a \ncondition of relying on others, a condition which has been a trap--and \nwe need to change welfare from being a condition to being a transition.\n  The welfare situation should be a time when we prepare ourselves for \nthe next step in our lives, when we prepare ourselves to be out of \ndependence and out of reliance on others, we prepare ourselves to be \nindustrious, to be independent and reliant upon ourselves.\n  Welfare cannot be something that is a lifestyle. It has to be \nsomething that is just for a while. It has to be something that moves \nus forward. I believe there are fundamental components of this bill \nwhich will do that, but we can enhance them substantially in their \ncapacity to change the character of welfare, to change it from a way of \nlife, to change it to a way of escape, to change it from a lifestyle, \nto change it to being a transition, to change it from a condition to \nbeing a transition.\n  Mr. President, according to Senator Moynihan, the average welfare \nrecipient spends 12.98 years on the rolls. That is a substantial and \nmonumental waste of human resource. We have individuals who are \nreliant, who are dependent, whose level of contribution and \nproductivity in our culture is very, very, very low, and that 12 years \nis a teaching time as well as a time of existence.\n  Unfortunately, that 12 years becomes a time when young people are \ntaught dependence instead of independence. They are taught reliance on \nGovernment instead of self-reliance.\n  One of the things we should ask ourselves about everything we do in \nGovernment is: What does it teach? What does it reinforce? What basic \nprinciples and values are advanced by it? And a welfare system that \nprovides for 12.98 years as the average time a welfare recipient spends \non the rolls--what about those that are on there longer? This is not \nteaching something that is valuable to our culture. We need to be \nreinforcing, providing incentives for support for a system that does \nnot institute a condition for life, making a career of welfare, but \nenergizes a transition for life, leaving welfare and going to work.\n  The 12.98 years is reflected in the fact that we have had soaring \nrates in the kind of social conditions that intensify the challenge and \nthe condition of welfare--a 600-percent increase in illegitimacy over \nthe last three decades. I think we can agree that the welfare system we \nnow have is a miserable failure, but if we do not build into this \nsystem things to change the outcomes, we are going to end up with the \nsame problems just being tougher and tougher to solve.\n  Industrialist friends of mine tell me that whatever system you have, \nyou can be assured that it is perfectly designed to give you what you \nare getting, and if you do not like what you are getting, you need to \nchange the system.\n  This welfare bill that we are debating today will shorten the time \nfrom 12.98 years down. It will limit most welfare recipients to a 5-\nyear lifetime limit on temporary assistance to needy families.\n  The big challenge of the 12-year problem is, What kind of habits do \nyou build in 12 years?\n\n[[Page S8403]]\n\n  I suspect that if you involve yourself in a routine for 12 years, it \nis very difficult ever to break that routine. Sociologists tell us, if \nyou want to lose weight--that is one of the things I want to do--they \nsay you have to change your habits for about 6 or 7 weeks in order to \nhave a new habit of diet, a new way to consume food. We are talking \nabout changing habits that people have hardened for 12.98 years on \naverage.\n  One of the problems I have is that we have said we are going to \nchange this by shortening the time period to 5 years. Well, 5 years \nwill build a habit which is so strong that it is almost impossible to \nbreak. I think we need to find a way to restructure the system so that \neveryone looks at that 5-year period as if it is an insurance policy \nand they do not want to take any more out of that bank of 5 years than \nthey need to at the moment because there might come a time sometime \nlater in life when they would have a desperate need for assistance. I \nbelieve that is what we need to do.\n  So we need to help people understand that there is 5 years. That is a \nlifetime limit. You should only draw from that savings account or \nreserve for emergencies what you desperately need and not use that 5 \nyears as a way to create the habit of dependence which will be almost \nimpossible for you to break.\n  But this bill would allow for most individuals 5 years--5 years--\nwithout work. Five years without work would build such a habit that I \nbelieve we would nearly disable the individuals, as we have with our \ncurrent system.\n  I was stunned when I read in one of my home State papers last year \nthat there was an experiment under a waiver granted by the Federal \nGovernment where they invited 140 welfare recipients to show up at a \nTyson Foods plant. Only half of them showed up for work. They were \ninvited to come in to look for a job. Of the half that showed up, only \n39 accepted jobs. Of the 39 that accepted jobs, fewer than 30 were on \nthe job a week after.\n  See, what we have done is we have built habits. We have established a \ncondition for welfare. We do not have welfare as a transition, as a \nplace of movement; it has become a place of repose. I believe we need \nto change that. For us to say that, even under this bill, which is a \nsignificant reform, for us to say that we would allow people to have 5 \nstraight years without work, where your self-esteem or your skills, \nyour motivation would atrophy, would wither--if you do not use a muscle \nfor 5 weeks, it gets weak. If you do not do not use it for 5 months, it \nalmost disappears. If you do not use it for 5 years, it is gone.\n  We have here the most important muscle in human character--self-\nesteem, skills, motivations. We are still providing in this bill that \nfor as long as 5 years you can simply be there not working. The bill, \nas it stands, requires 15 percent of the unexempted population to work \nin the first year period, and 25 percent in the second year period--25 \npercent. That is one out of four. So for three out of four, they could \ngo right by the first 2-year period and not even be involved in work.\n  I believe, though, as a result of this, that welfare recipients, \nother than that 25 percent who actually went to work, could just choose \nto coast along for the full 5 years of benefits with no additional \nincentive to get a job. I think that is where this bill needs \ncorrection. It needs dramatic correction.\n  I propose to amend this welfare bill to allow welfare recipients, \nable-bodied welfare recipients without infant children, to collect only \n24 months of consecutive temporary assistance-to-needy-families \nbenefits. At the end of those 2 years, if the recipient still refuses \nto work, I say, cut the benefit. What this really does is not result in \ncut benefits; this results in more people being willing to work.\n  Instead of saying to an individual who gets on welfare, if you work \nthe system, you can last for 5 years, create the habits of reliance, \ncreate the habits of repose, reject the habits of industry and work; \nthis would basically say, you better get to work, learning to get a job \nright away, because after 2 years, in spite of the fact that there is a \n5-year lifetime limit, there is a 24-month consecutive receipt-of-\nbenefit limit for able-bodied adults without infant children.\n  If a welfare recipient then decides not to work in the 2-year time \nspan, the payment would cease. By doing this, we simply hope to inject \na concept which is too novel which ought to be commonplace. That is the \nconcept that work is beneficial and that it pays better and is better \nthan welfare. Otherwise, we are simply going to be tempting people to \nstay on and approximate, or approach at least, as much as they can of \nthe 12.98 years of time on welfare, which is now a debilitating and \ndisabling influence in the American culture for too many Americans.\n  Our intention is to leave the time period between any times you \nconsume your 24 consecutive months total up to the States, so that \nrecipients could not leave the welfare rolls and sign up again a week \nlater. I think States could make these judgments about what kind of \ninterval that would be needed between the 24-month periods. Our central \npoint, our responsibility here, is to say that we want to provide as \npart of the structure of our reform the energy to change, legislation \nthat changes welfare from being a lifestyle to being a transition. We \nwant to start to energize a commitment on the part of recipients to \nmake the changes in the way they live so that they avoid prolonged \nexposures to the welfare system and find themselves at an earlier time \nbeing capable of sustaining themselves.\n  We want welfare recipients to look at this 5-year period as a \nlifetime cushion, not to be consumed in the first need or the second \nneed, hopefully never to be consumed. Our objective should be that no \none ever bumps the 5-year limit. Our objective should be that we \nenergize people to go to work so quickly and so enthusiastically that \nthey maintain their reserve to the day they die.\n  Permitting able-bodied welfare recipients to remain on assistance for \na straight 5-year-long block of time simply would reinforce, reteach, \nperpetuate, and underscore the current cycle of dependence. We need to \nstop this cycle of dependence, not just for individuals, but for what \nit teaches to our children. Welfare has become an intergenerational \nphenomenon, where people are on so long that their children grow up \nknowing only one lifestyle--it is welfare. By limiting the \nuninterrupted block of time that welfare recipients remain on the \nrolls, we will reduce the level of dependence on government assistance.\n  Welfare can be habit forming, and has been habit forming. It can be \naddictive. It can be destructive, and it has been. We need to take the \nstructural components of the welfare system, which are dehumanizing, \ndemeaning and disabling, out of the system. We need to energize each \nindividual to view welfare as transitional. We should do that by saying \nthere can be no more than 24 consecutive months on welfare for any \nable-bodied individual without infant children, unless they will work.\n  I just indicate that on Tuesday of this last week President Clinton \nordered that in case we do not pass welfare reform in the next few \nmonths, the Department of Health and Human Services will give States \nthe power to cut off benefits if an able-bodied adult refuses to work \nafter 2 years. This is not a Draconian message. This is a message and \nthis is a concept called for by the President of the United States.\n  For us to deliver a welfare system back to the American people which \nreinforces, underlines, and strengthens the bad habit of long-term \ndependency would not only be an affront to the American people, but it \nwould be our failure to respond to a President who has asked us to do \nmuch better. There is something much better that we should be doing, \nand something we can do. If we want to break the long-term aspects, the \nintergenerational aspects of welfare, we have to be a part of this \nteaching idea in a real way.\n  When I was Governor of the State of Missouri and I had the great \nprivilege of serving the people of my State, we came to Washington to \nask for a waiver, a waiver from the regulations of the Federal \nGovernment. The waiver was simply this: We said, please give Missouri \nthe right to say to welfare recipients, if you do not make sure your \nkids are in school, you will not get your full benefit. It was a way of \nsaying welfare is not a place where you can throw responsibility to the \nwind. It was a way of saying, if you are a parent, you have to be \nresponsible for at least some fundamental basic things, like getting\n\n[[Page S8404]]\n\nyour kids to school, because we do not want your kids to stay at home \nand learn welfare, we want your kids to go to school and learn how to \nbe productive. We were able to get that waiver. The program was called \nPeople Attaining Self-Sufficiency, PASS. PASS had some reference to \nschool. We wanted kids to pass in school by having good attendance.\n\n  I think there is another part of the structure of welfare reform that \nwe should embrace as we send the bill to the President of the United \nStates. We should not have to have States coming to Washington, waiting \n2 or 3 years, filling out enough paperwork to choke a horse in order to \nhave the privilege of saying to people, ``We expect you to make sure \nyour kids are in school or we are not going to make sure your check is \nin the mail.'' It is that simple. It is very fundamental. If you are on \nwelfare, your kids should be in school, because it is especially \nimportant to break the intergenerational chain of dependence. Part of \nthis measure is to make sure we say to the individuals, ``You have some \nresponsibility.''\n  Another important concept of this amendment is that it would allow \nStates to require temporary assistance to needy families and food stamp \nrecipients to either have a high school education or work toward \nattaining a high school education. It is my judgment that it is not \nvery realistic to say to people, ``We are sending you to work, but you \ndo not have to have the kind of fundamental and basic skills that come \nfrom education.'' I am not talking about worker training here, I am \ntalking about education. I am talking about the fact that an educated \nperson can read the manual and train himself or herself. I am talking \nabout the fundamental responsibility of culture, not the responsibility \nof a business to train people to do its business. I am talking about \nthe fundamental responsibility of a culture to train its citizens by \nway of education.\n  Education is different, really, from training. Education is the basis \nupon which training builds. A person who cannot read or write will have \na hard time, no matter how much training she gets. I believe if a \nperson is going to be receiving this assistance that we need to say to \nthem, ``You are going to have to invest in yourself to the extent of \nhaving a high school education or a general equivalency diploma. The \ntruth of the matter is you have a responsibility, and you have to be \nprepared to meet that responsibility.''\n  As a matter of fact, this is a far more important thing than it has \never been before, because once we put a time limit on these matters, we \nneed to energize people to be ready in order to fend for themselves \nwhen the time limit has expired. I hope we will have a 2-year time \nlength on consecutive months of benefits, 24 months, and I believe in a \n5-year lifetime benefit, as well. With that in mind we will have to \nmake sure that people can fend for themselves at the expiration of that \ntime.\n  Mr. President, I reserve the balance of my time, but I am happy to \nyield back my time on the amendment when all time is ready to be \nyielded back.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I see the distinguished chairman of the \nBudget Committee on the floor; is he seeking recognition?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I wondered who on the Democratic side was going to \noppose this amendment.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I was going to make a general statement. I \nwill be introducing an amendment later. I was going to be making a \nshort but general statement, if there is no objection to that.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, might I ask staff, perhaps they could \nconfer with Senator Leahy.\n  Is there somebody on your side that wants to respond to this \namendment?\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I say to the distinguished Senator from New \nMexico, I came to the floor because there was not anybody on the floor \nat this moment. I notice there that have been some quorum calls. I \nthought rather than hold up anything later on, as I would take probably \nless time than it would take now in discussing this, if I could just \nmake a couple of comments about the nutrition aspects of the \nreconciliation bill.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I have no objection if the distinguished \nSenator from Missouri has no objection to temporarily setting this \naside while the Senator from Vermont proceeds.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I wish to speak just briefly on matters \ninvolving nutrition aspects of the reconciliation bill. I will, later \non, have amendments in that regard. It seems like this was a good time \nto speak.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, we need not set anything aside, but give \nhim unanimous consent to proceed on a matter not related to this \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. McCain). The unanimous-consent request by \nthe Senator from New Mexico is agreed to, and the Senator from Vermont \nis recognized to speak.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I thank my distinguished friend from New Mexico, the \ndistinguished Presiding Officer from Arizona, and the distinguished \nSenator from Missouri.\n  Mr. President, my message today is very simple--my concern is that \nthe nutrition cuts in the reconciliation bill are going to make \nchildren go hungry if they are allowed to stay as they are.\n  At the beginning of this Congress, I attacked some of those people \nwith the Contract With America crowd because they wanted to repeal the \nSchool Lunch Act, at that time in the name of balancing the budget. I \nalso attacked them because they wanted to repeal the school breakfast \nprogram and then they wanted to repeal the summer food service program. \nI am not sure why they did that, but it was interesting to see how the \nAmerican public reacted. They reacted with outrage.\n  Now I am afraid that the same American public is being fooled, \nbecause these nutrition cuts are now being made in a reconciliation \nbill. The same nutrition cuts that could not be made frontally are \ngoing to be made indirectly in the reconciliation bill.\n  It appears to me that the Contract With America crowd has totally \nabandoned its effort to balance the budget. Now they will settle for \njust taking food from children. The amendment to strike Medicaid \nwithout an offset means that senior citizens vote, but it shows they \nunderstand that children do not vote. If children could vote, there is \nno doubt in my mind these nutrition cuts would not be in this bill. In \nfact, if children could vote, the nutrition cuts that cut the school \nlunch, school breakfast, and summer reading programs would not even be \nattempted.\n  Nationwide, the nutrition cuts will take the equivalent of 20 billion \nmeals from low-income families over the next 6 years. Children do not \nhave political PAC's. Children do not vote. But now we find out what \nhappens, children are the ones that will be hurt by these cuts.\n  If these cuts had something to do with balancing the budget, or were \npart of a larger effort to balance the budget, that would at least \nprovide some justification. These programs that the Republican majority \npropose in child care food programs, these cuts hurt preschool-age \nchildren in day care homes in my home State of Vermont and in the rest \nof the Nation. Families with children will absorb at least 70 percent \nof the food stamp reductions. The impact on Vermont will be \nsignificant. The average food stamp benefit will drop to 65 cents per \nperson per meal. Defy anybody to eat at 65 cents per meal. I think \nparents will have a very difficult time feeding hungry children on a \n65-cent budget. I remember my three children when they were going up \ncould eat you out of house and home. They certainly could not be fed on \n65 cents a meal.\n  Most of these food stamp cuts are done cleverly. There is $23 billion \nthat comes from provisions that alter the mathematical factors and \nformula used in computer software, so nobody sees or figures it out. \nBut the end result is there are lower benefits for children.\n  Children will go hungry because new computer programs are used. These \nhungry children will not even know they have been reformed; neither \nwill their parents. All they will know is they are going to be a lot, \nlot hungrier once the computers turn on.\n  Over 95 percent of the cuts in nutrition programs are unrelated to \nwelfare reform. Most cuts are simply implemented by computer software. \nI do not know how that represents reform--unless somebody feels that a \ncomputer can think and feed and knows hunger, and a computer can \nrecognize hungry children.\n  In fact, in a couple of years, hunger among Vermont children will \ndramatically increase under this bill. As it is\n\n[[Page S8405]]\n\nnow written in the nutrition areas, it is antifamily, antichild, it is \nmean-spirited, and it is really beneath what a great country should \nstand for. It takes food from children, and it does virtually nothing \nto reform or improve nutrition programs. In fact, it is not even an \nattempt to balance the budget, so we can at least say we are doing that \nfor the children in future years.\n  A lot of talk was made last year about the Contract With America and \nabout how the budget will be balanced with real cuts. I said at that \ntime that I did not think the people who were ``talking that talk'' \nwould ``walk the walk'' by making the real cuts. I was right.\n  That net result of this Congress will be that the Agriculture \nCommittee baseline is greatly reduced, and that other committees will \nget away without contributing a penny, let alone their fair share, \ntoward balancing the budget. But what that means is, when it works its \nway down, it works its way down to children. Why? As I said before, \nchildren do not vote, children do not contribute to PAC's, children do \nnot hire lobbyists, children do not get involved in campaigns. So \nchildren will go hungry. It is as simple as that. Everybody else gets \nprotected.\n  The distinguished chairman of the Budget Committee was on the floor \nhere a minute ago. I remember when he came before the Agriculture \nCommittee in 1990. He called the Food Stamp Program ``the backbone of \nour way of helping the needy in this country.'' I agreed with Senator \nDomenici when he said that. But now that backbone is being broken in \nthis bill. In a couple of years, there will be a stream of news stories \nabout hungry children standing in lines at soup kitchens, because over \n80 percent of food stamp benefits go to families with children.\n  Let us not have a bill that punishes children because they cannot \nvote. Let us do what the distinguished Senator from New Mexico said in \n1990. Let us remember our children. Let us remember the Food Stamp \nProgram, which, as he said so eloquently, ``is the backbone of our way \nof helping the needy in this country.''\n  So, Mr. President, I will have amendments later on to improve this, \nunless improvements are made before that time. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DOMENICI addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico is recognized.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I understand that the Democratic side \nwill have no one responding to the Senator from Missouri. If the \nSenator finishes, he can yield back the remainder of his time, and we \nwill ask that they yield back any time they have, and the Senator's \namendment will be final, unless the point of order lies, and the \nSenator will have time tomorrow to explain it.\n  I appreciate the comments of the distinguished Senator from Vermont. \nI say, however, that statements I made with reference to food stamps \nshould not mean that the Senator from New Mexico does not think that, \nfrom time to time, we must look at the program, because it is \nfrequently abused and abused in many ways. We have lent ourselves to \nsome of that abuse by the way we have written the law.\n  I know we are setting about in this bill to reform food stamps and \nmake sure that it is less fraudulently used. But I wanted to make sure \nthat my entire thoughts about it, as I went before the committee in \n1990, are at least here in principle in the Record today.\n  Mr. LEAHY. If the Senator will yield on that point, would the Senator \nfrom New Mexico agree with me that the Food Stamp Program, properly \nused, can be of extreme benefit to low-income children.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. There is no question about it. We do not have a better \nprogram----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. I admonish both Senators to observe the rules \nof the Senate. You must address each other through the Chair.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I believe I had, Mr. President. I believe I asked if the \nSenator would yield so I might ask him a question.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. But the Chair did not rule. Without objection, \nthe Senator from Vermont is recognized to ask a question of the Senator \nfrom New Mexico.\n  I think the Senator from Vermont knows the rules.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I repeat my question to the Senator from \nNew Mexico. Would he not agree that the food stamp proposal, properly \nused, is extremely helpful in feeding low-income children in this \ncountry?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico is recognized.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I was going to respond to the question.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico is recognized.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Certainly, I agree. I do not know that we have found a \nbetter way, yet, even with all of its faults, to get nutrition into the \nhands of the poor. I repeat that, however, I think the Senator from \nVermont knows that no matter how good it is, it is frequently abused. \nWe sometimes ``right it'' in ways that make it subject to being abused \nmore so. I only wanted to make that comment. I agree that we have not \nyet found a better way. Cash benefits do not seem to work as well \nbecause, indeed, they are not used for nutritional items. If we keep a \ntight grasp on making sure they are not fraudulently traded and they \nare used for nutrition, we do not have anything better yet that I am \naware of.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, my point is that we have seen some great \nchanges in the Food Stamp Program, some very significant improvements, \nover the years. We have seen other improvements that we wait to come \nforth, like the use of electronic benefit transfer.\n  I have been very proud to work very closely with the now chairman of \nthe Senate Agriculture Committee and, before that, the ranking member \nof the Senate Agriculture Committee, the senior Senator from Indiana, \nin making these improvements. They have saved a lot of money. I also \npoint out that the Food Stamp Program is extremely important.\n  During the last administration, 40,000 to 45,000 people were added \nevery single week in the 4 years President Bush was President--40,000 \nto 45,000 every single week for 4 years were added. That is, in over \n200 weeks they were added to the food stamp rolls.\n  Let me just remind my friend from New Mexico and others about this. \nWhen we talk about whether this program is utilized in a Republican or \nDemocratic administration, it is a program for everybody. During the \nBush administration, every single week, because of the way the economy \nwas, 40,000 people were added, at the taxpayers' expense, to the food \nstamp rolls.\n  We have been fortunate with the efforts to balance the budget and \nimprove the economy, and since President Clinton came in, 2 million \npeople have been able to drop from the food stamp rolls, as compared to \n40,000 people a week being added in the 200 weeks during the past \nadministration. Two million people have now been taken off in this \nadministration. That is good news for the economy and good news for the \ntaxpayers. But it also points out that in both Democratic and \nRepublican administrations, we should be protecting the Food Stamp \nProgram.\n  Reform it? Yes. My point is, of course, that a computer program that \nsimply cuts children off without reform is not reform. We should be \nwilling to stand up as legislators and make the tough decisions on how \nto reform the Food Stamp Program, and not simply say to a computer \nprogram: Here, you do it. We cannot totally cut off children because \nthey do not vote, they do not contribute, and they are not part of the \npolitical process. They will never complain.\n  We will not touch anything in areas of senior citizens, or anybody \nelse, because they do vote and they do complain. By golly, those \nchildren--tough. Go hungry.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Hatfield). Who seeks recognition?\n  Mr. ASHCROFT addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Thank you, Mr. President. I will make a few remarks \nabout the amendment which I proposed.\n  I want to reinforce again the concept that we need to change the \ncharacter of welfare. We need to change welfare from being a condition \nin which people exist to being a transition from dependency--not only \nfrom dependency but long-term dependency--to independence, to work, to \ngrowth, and to opportunity. If we are going to do that,\n\n[[Page S8406]]\n\nwe should not acquiesce to a 5-year limit which allows people to go \nonto welfare and just get on it and stay for 5 years without doing \nanything. We should require of individuals--or at least provide that \nStates require of individuals--that a number of things be done.\n  One, we should say no longer can you stay on welfare for more than 24 \nmonths in any one stretch without going to work or preparing for work \nby taking work training and getting an education.\n  Second, we should say never can you stay on welfare if you do not \nfulfill your responsibility to send your kids to school. If you are \ngoing to be on welfare, your kids ought to be in school. Children who \nare in school are less of a burden to individuals on welfare than \nchildren who are allowed to stay home or otherwise avoid their \nresponsibility.\n  Third, if we expect people eventually to become self-reliant in their \nown setting, we are going to have to ask those individuals to have \nfundamental educational qualifications as well. In my judgment, that is \nthe reason we ought to allow States to require that individuals who are \nseeking to continue to receive welfare benefits either have or be in \nthe process of attaining the kind of educational qualifications that \nwould come with a high school diploma or a GED.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that all time be yielded back \non the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 4942 to Amendment No. 4941\n\n(Purpose: To provide that a family may not receive TANF assistance for \nmore than 24 consecutive months at a time unless an adult in the family \n is working or a State exempts an adult in the family from working for \n                          reasons of hardship)\n\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I send my amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Missouri (Mr. Ashcroft) proposes an \n     amendment numbered 4942 to amendment No. 4941.\n\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       In lieu of the matter proposed to be inserted by the \n     amendment, insert the following:\n       ``(8) No assistance for more than 5 years.--\n       (A) In general.--Except as provided in subparagraphs (B) \n     and (C), a State to which a grant is made under section 403 \n     shall not use any part of the grant to provide assistance to \n     a family that includes an adult who has received assistance \n     under any State program funded under this part attributable \n     to funds provided by the Federal Government for 60 months \n     (whether or not consecutive) after the date the State program \n     funded under this part commences.

Mr. President, there are three basic thrusts that are \nundertaken in these amendments. They are the conversion of a system \nfrom being a system of conditioning people to be dependent to \ntransitioning people to be at work.\n  The first thrust is that we would have a 24-consecutive-month limit \non welfare for those who refuse to work or get training at the end of \nthe 24 months. It seems to me that is something that the President of \nthe United States called for last week and which we ought to have.\n  The second component of this strategy is to say that those who are on \nwelfare should have their children in school. It is not something that \nis unknown or mysterious. The fact of the matter is that high school \ndropouts average $12,809 a year, a poverty-level standard of living for \na family of three. For an individual who has a high school degree, the \naverage is $18,737, a 46-percent higher income than the average for \ndropouts.\n  Half of those arrested for drug violations in 1995 did not have a \nhigh school diploma. And the preponderance of all crimes, 40 percent of \nall crimes, were committed by those who did not finish high school. It \nis time for us to ask those who are involved in the welfare system by \nway of receiving benefits under temporary assistance to needy families \nto make sure that their children are in school.\n  A high school degree is a key to escaping from the welfare trap. \nStatistics show that it keeps kids out of jail. Every parent has a \nprincipal and primary responsibility to make sure their children \nreceive the kinds of fundamentals that will allow them to fend for \nthemselves. Every child can attend school in America. Every child can \nearn a high school diploma. It costs nothing but commitment and \nresponsibility. Too often this opportunity is ignored--even trashed. \nTeens drop out of school, grade school, or skip classes. This is a \ntragic waste of a precious resource, one on which our culture must \nrely.\n  All of our Government institutions should do everything possible to \nensure that children go to school and earn a degree. Government should \ncertainly not be paying parents to let their kids play hooky and skip \nschool. If you are on welfare, your kids should be in school. Parents \nshould not be coconspirators in perpetuating their children in a \nlifetime on and off of welfare, in and out of minimum-wage jobs, and \nirresponsibility. Children must go to school in order to break the \ncycle of dependency, to change welfare from being a long-term condition \ninto being a transition.\n  The amendment that I propose allows States--I repeat, allows States--\nto sanction welfare recipients of the temporary assistance to needy \nfamilies that do not ensure that their children are attending school. \nIt also allows States to sanction food stamp recipients who do not send \ntheir children to school. Children who graduate from a welfare system \nshould be armed with a degree rather than with a habit of dependence. \nIt is the key to self-reliance and success.\n  We have watched, as the Nation has watched, the Olympics. We need our \nfull team on the field whenever we play. Even ``The Dream Team'' would \nhave a tough time if they did not have the entire capacity of the team \navailable as a resource. And yet we allow our citizens sometimes to ask \nfor our help and to persist in receiving it without equipping \nthemselves, without making a commitment to themselves. The last \ncomponent of my amendments is really a way of saying if you are going \nto be on welfare, you have to have or be working toward a high school \ndiploma so you can work for yourself and help yourself.\n\n  It is no mystery. States may require that temporary assistance to \nneedy families and food stamp recipients work toward attaining a high \nschool diploma or its equivalent as a condition of receiving welfare \nassistance. This requirement would not apply if an individual was \ndetermined in the judgment of medical, psychiatric, or other \nappropriate professionals to lack the requisite capacity to attain a \nhigh school diploma or GED.\n  During the debate this year in the Senate, Senator Simon once said, \n``We can have all the job training in the world, but if we do not face \nthe problem of basic education, we are not going to do what we ought to \ndo for this country.''\n  I cannot agree more with that statement. It does not pay us to \nprovide job training upon job training upon job training when welfare \nrecipients have not achieved proficiency in the fundamental underlying \nskills of mathematics, English, and reading which provide people with \nthe tools to benefit from job training and to assimilate changes in the \njob market. We do not have jobs and crafts that do not change. They all \nhave new processes and new procedures. As technology marches on, it is \nimportant to make sure that individuals cannot only get the right kind \nof job training but they possess the fundamental characteristic of \nbeing educated in order to be able to take advantage of job training \nwhen it comes along.\n  A person over 18 without a high school diploma averages $12,800 in \nearnings; with a high school diploma, $18,700 in earnings. A $6,000 \ndifference is the difference between dependence and independence, the \ndifference between self-reliance and reliance on Government. The U.S. \nSentencing Commission determined that 40 percent of the individuals who \ncommit crimes are individuals without high school diplomas. The \nCommission also found that these individuals are responsible for 50 \npercent of all drug violations. If people are going to receive welfare \nbenefits, they should at least be working toward the fundamental \nequipping, enabling, freeing achievement of having a high school \neducation.\n  Mr. President, I would be pleased together with the opponents of this \namendment on the other side of the aisle to yield back the remainder of \nthe time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has yielded back the remainder----\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I need somebody from the other side of \nthe aisle to yield back their time or we cannot proceed with any other \namendments.\n  Mr. CONRAD. We are willing to yield back the time on this side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has been yielded back.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, pursuant to the previous understanding, \nI believe the distinguished Senator is entitled to offer his amendment \nat this point.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4945\n\n(Purpose: To expand State flexibility in order to encourage food stamp \n          recipients to look for work and to prevent hardship)\n\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I would call up my amendment that is at \nthe desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from North Dakota [Mr. Conrad], for himself and \n     Mr. Leahy, proposes an amendment numbered 4945.\n\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 6, strike lines 14 through 16 and insert the \n     following:\n       Section 5(d)(7) of the Food Stamp Act of 1977 (7 U.S.C. \n     2014(d)(7)) is amended by striking ``21 years of age or \n     younger'' and inserting ``19 years of age or younger (17 \n     years of age or younger in fiscal year 2002)''.\n       On page 21, line 3, strike ``$5,100'' and insert \n     ``$4,650''.\n       On page 49, line 3, strike ``10'' and insert ``20''.\n       On page 49, line 12, strike ``1 month'' and insert ``2 \n     months''.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n\n[[Page S8408]]\n\n  Mr. CONRAD. I thank the Chair.\n  I am joined in this amendment by my colleague from Vermont, Senator \nLeahy, the ranking member of the Senate Agriculture Committee. This \namendment addresses a serious problem with the food stamp provisions of \nthe welfare bill that is before us now.\n  As I describe our amendment, I would like to bring my colleagues' \nattention to the chart beside me and the number 600,000 because that is \nthe impact of the food stamp provisions before us; 600,000 Americans \nwill lose eligibility each month under the provision that is in the \nbill before us.\n  The 600,000 estimated by the Congressional Budget Office is to be the \nnumber of people who would be terminated from the Food Stamp Program in \nany given month because they are unable to find a job within the 4-\nmonth time limit provided for in this legislation. Our amendment \ninsists on work, and that is as it should be. But it promotes State \nflexibility by giving States an option to assist people who would \notherwise be at risk of going hungry. Our amendment achieves these \ngoals in two ways. First, the amendment would expand the State option \nto exercise a hardship exemption. The amendment increases the hardship \nexemption from 10 percent to 20 percent of the eligible population and \nmakes it consistent with the AFDC block grant.\n  Simply stated, we are allowing States, instead of being able to \ndeclare 10 percent of their eligible population hardship cases not \nbound by the 4-month limit, to increase that at State option to 20 \npercent.\n  Second, the amendment allows States to count job search as work for 2 \nmonths instead of the 1 month provided in the bill before us. I want to \nbe clear to my colleagues that the cost of this amendment is fully \noffset over the 6-year budget period. The Agriculture Committee will \nstill be in full compliance with its budget reconciliation target.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. CONRAD. I would be happy to yield to my colleague if we do not \nhave an interruption.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I want to use my time.\n  Mr. President, in behalf of the distinguished chairman of the \nAgriculture Committee, I understand the amendment offered by Senator \nConrad allows States to exempt up to 20 percent of the able-bodied 18 \nto 50-year-olds from the work requirement and allow up to 2 months of \njob search per year to count as work.\n  Mr. CONRAD. That is correct.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I believe the Food Stamp Program should have a strong \nwork requirement as the Senator has indicated. I am now speaking in \nbehalf of the chairman of the Agriculture Committee. Senator Lugar \nunderstands the Senator's concern about the individuals who are willing \nto work may be unable to find a job due to circumstances beyond their \ncontrol. Senator Lugar continues on that in behalf of the Agriculture \nCommittee, he finds the offsets acceptable and the amendment \nacceptable.\n  So at this point I want the Senator to know I am going to yield back \nall the time we have in opposition and indicate for the Record we are \nwilling to accept the amendment.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I appreciate that from the able manager of the bill. I \nwill just proceed briefly to outline the rationale for the amendment \nand then yield back our time as well.\n  Mr. President, everybody here agrees that work is important and that \nfood stamp benefits should be temporary. But the work requirement \nprovision in the pending welfare bill would have the unintended effect \nof preventing people who want to find work from securing a job. How can \nmy colleagues seriously argue that people can be expected to find a \njob, to sit through an interview when they have not eaten? It does not \nwork. I understand and support the work ethic in America, but I also \nbelieve our society has achieved a level of decency where we will not \ndeny food assistance to people who have been unable to find a job in \njust 4 months.\n  The reason I felt it was important to offer this amendment is I have \ndealt with people who are in this exact circumstance. I remember very \nwell a young fellow who worked construction in my State--very frankly, \nnot the smartest guy in the world, and he had a hard time finding work, \nbut he was able to work construction. He was a strong kid and he was \nable to work in that way. But the construction season in my state is \nnot very long. You are lucky if you can be in construction 6 months out \nof the year in North Dakota some years.\n  This young fellow would work during the construction season, which \nusually starts in April in North Dakota, but come winter, November, the \nconstruction season ended. He was not able to find additional work. And \nI tell you, he came from a family that had next to nothing. He had next \nto nothing, lived in a very modest basement apartment, and that fellow \nneeded some help during the winter to eat. That is just the reality of \nthe circumstance.\n  Under this legislation, after 4 months, that guy would not get any \nhelp. Is that really what we want to do in America? Is that really what \nwe want to do? We want to say to somebody, if you cannot find a job in \n4 months, you do not get any food assistance? Is that what we have come \nto in this country? I find that hard to believe.\n\n  I really must say to my colleagues, if that is where we are, then \nsomething is radically wrong in this country. America is better than \nthat. We are a wealthy nation, with a rich and abundant food supply. We \nshould not knowingly adopt a national policy which promotes hunger. \nCertainly we should promote work, but not cut people off from food if \nthey have not been able to find a job in 4 months. This amendment gives \nStates the option to provide food for people who are unable to find a \njob within 4 months, at least 20 percent they can exempt as hardship \ncases, and they can count 2 months of looking for work as part of work.\n  As I already mentioned and as the chart serves to remind us, in \naddition to the number of people cut off the Food Stamp Program because \nof the tightened eligibility requirements and work registration \nrequirements, the Congressional Budget Office has estimated the welfare \nbill before us will cut 600,000 people off of food stamps each month \nbecause they cannot find a job within the 4-month time limit. These \n600,000 people will then be at risk of going hungry, more worried about \nfinding their next meal than finding a job.\n  I cannot believe that is what we are about here in the U.S. Senate. \nAccording to a study done in 1993, 83 percent of the people who would \nbe affected by this draconian provision are below 50 percent of the \npoverty line. We are talking about folks who do not have anything. Now \nwe are going to say to them, ``If you do not get a job within 4 months, \nyou do not get to eat''? I cannot believe we are going to do that.\n  I am all for strong work requirements. I introduced my own welfare \nreform bill that had the toughest work requirements of any bill before \nus. But this is not a work provision. This is a hunger provision. We \nare talking about food for people who cannot find a job. I think it is \nentirely reasonable to give States the option to continue food stamp \ncoverage for an additional month of intensive job search, to help make \nsure that poor people complete the transition from welfare to work.\n  The Senate-passed welfare reform bill that was supported by 87 \nSenators contained 6 months of food stamp eligibility for people in \nthis category. Bipartisan efforts to reform the welfare system, \nincluding the Chafee-Breaux approach and the Specter-Biden proposal, \nalso contained a 6-month food stamp time limit. These are far more \nhumane and realistic provisions.\n  Mr. President, for those who think the majority of people affected by \nthis provision are just scamming the system and are not interested in \nworking, let me put this in perspective by translating it into dollar \nterms. Under the Food Stamp Program, the maximum level of benefits for \na single person is $119 a month. That is about $4 a day. The \nCongressional Budget Office estimates that every one of the 600,000 who \ncannot find a job would accept job training or a work slot if one was \navailable through the Food Stamp Employment Training Program. These \n600,000 people are, consequently, receiving less than $4 a day in food \nstamps.\n  I ask my colleagues to think seriously about what this means, less \nthan $4 a day in food stamps. Does it not make sense if there were \nactually minimum wage jobs available for $4.25 an\n\n[[Page S8409]]\n\nhour that individuals would work at these jobs? Why would anyone trade \na $4.25-an-hour job for $4 a day in food stamps? I do not think the \nvast majority of people would make that kind of trade. Clearly, we are \ntalking about circumstances in which those jobs are not available. \nPeople cannot find those jobs. This is not a case of they are better \noff taking welfare than taking a job for $4 in food assistance. You \nwould be much better off, clearly, with $4 an hour in a job.\n  Before I close, I want to spend just a minute talking about the \nhardship exemption. Again, I share the view of those who believe we \nmust set limits and push people from welfare to work. But I think it is \nimportant to recognize there are people who just do not have the skills \nto find a job, or else have some personal hardship that means they will \nnot be employed after 4 months on food stamps. Every one of us know \npeople who, frankly, are marginal in the employment arena. They cannot \nfind work. They are not educated, they are not trained, they may have \none or more disabilities.\n  It is important, I think, also, to consider the devastating effects \nof natural disasters or economic downturn on a particular area, which \nmay make it difficult for people to find employment in 4 months. If you \nhave a natural disaster like a hurricane, tornado, earthquake, or a \nseries of disasters as we have seen in California, all of a sudden an \narea may not have much in the way of employment. People may not be able \nto find a job.\n  I think it is also important for us to understand this issue affects \nurban areas and could cause increased tensions in some of America's \nbiggest cities. A recent study showed that for every McDonald's opening \nin New York City, there were 14 applicants. They wanted to work, wanted \nto have a job. For whatever reason, they were not able to find a job. \nThat circumstance has improved because the national economy has \nimproved, but we all know the economy is subjected to cycles. Sometimes \nit is good and strong and sometimes it is not so good, not so strong.\n  What are we going to say to people who cannot find a job after 4 \nmonths? We are going to deny them food stamps? What are we telling \nthem? Telling them to go to the garbage can to find something to eat?\n  I have people right now going through my neighborhood who are looking \nin garbage cans trying to find something to eat, and my neighborhood in \nthis town is eight blocks from where we are right now, eight blocks due \neast of the Capitol of the United States. I have people every day going \nthrough my neighborhood, going through garbage cans. If we want more of \nit, I suppose we just stick with what is in the underlying bill.\n  I might say it is not just urban areas, but rural areas as well. \nThere are parts of my State which have very low populations, small \ncommunities, and jobs are scarce in some of these areas. An individual \nwho has worked hard for 20 years in a small business in a rural area, \nand maybe that business fails, now this person may be willing to work \nall night and all day if given the chance, but the harsh reality is he \nor she may not be able to find a job. The truth of the matter is, it \nmay take more than 4 months for a new business to come to that \ncommunity.\n  We need to give States the option to offer food assistance to hard-\nworking people who experience extreme hardship. It is wrong to force \nStates to cut these people off from food assistance. Instead, we should \ngive States the flexibility to continue to provide food stamps to a \nlimited number, up to 20 percent of individuals who face some special \nhardship, Mr. President, 20 percent of the eligible population, instead \nof 10 percent that is in the underlying bill.\n  Mr. President, it may not be politically popular to care about adults \nwho are hungry and cannot find a job, but I want my colleagues to think \nabout what it would be like to be without food. We are not talking here \nabout the luxuries. We are talking about food. It strikes me it is bad \npolicy, and bad for the country, to knowingly create a class of \ndesperate people across the country, struggling for the most basic \nhuman necessity, food.\n  Fundamentally, it does not make sense to deny food to people who are \nworking hard to find a job and cannot find one. These people are less, \nnot more likely to find a job if they are spending their time trying to \nfind their next meal instead of trying to find their next job.\n  I ask my colleagues to join me in giving States additional \nflexibility to continue to provide food assistance to people who are \nunable to find work within the 4 months provided for in this \nlegislation.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If there be no further debate, the question is \non agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 4945) was agreed to.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote, and I move \nto lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I have two amendments by Senator \nLieberman which we are going to accept.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4946\n\n (Purpose: To add provisions to reduce the incidence of statutory rape)\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, on behalf of Senator Lieberman, I send \nan amendment to the desk. This amendment has been agreed to on both \nsides. I ask unanimous consent that it be agreed to and that the motion \nto reconsider be laid upon the table.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       Section 2101 is amended--\n       (1) by redesignating paragraphs (7) through (9) as \n     paragraphs (8) through (10), respectively;\n       (2) in paragraph (10), as so redesignated, by inserting ``, \n     and protection of teenage girls from pregnancy as well as \n     predatory sexual behavior'' after ``birth''; and\n       (3) by inserting after paragraph (6), the following:\n       (7) An effective strategy to combat teenage pregnancy must \n     address the issue of male responsibility, including statutory \n     rape culpability and prevention. The increase of teenage \n     pregnancies among the youngest girls is particularly severe \n     and is linked to predatory sexual practices by men who are \n     significantly older.\n       (A) It is estimated that in the late 1980's the rate for \n     girls age 14 and under giving birth increased 26 percent.\n       (B) Data indicates that at least half of the children born \n     to teenage mothers are fathered by adult men. Available data \n     suggests that almost 70 percent of births to teenage girls \n     are fathered by men over age 20.\n       (C) Surveys of teen mothers have revealed that a majority \n     of such mothers have histories of sexual and physical abuse, \n     primarily with older adult men.\n       Section 402(a)(1)(A) of the Social Security Act, as added \n     by section 2103(a)(1), is amended--\n       (1) by redesignating clauses (vi) and (vii) as clauses \n     (vii) and (viii), respectively; and\n       (2) by inserting after clause (v), the following:\n       ``(vi) Conduct a program, designed to reach State and local \n     law enforcement officials, the education system, and relevant \n     counseling services, that provides education and training on \n     the problem of statutory rape so that teenage pregnancy \n     prevention programs may be expanded in scope to include men.\n       Section 2908 is amended--\n       (1) by inserting ``(a) Sense of the Senate.--'' before \n     ``It''; and\n       (2) by adding at the end the following:\n       (b) Justice Department Program on Statutory Rape.--\n       (1) Establishment.--Not later than January 1, 1997, the \n     Attorney General shall establish and implement a program \n     that--\n       (A) studies the linkage between statutory rape and teenage \n     pregnancy, particularly by predatory older men committing \n     repeat offenses; and\n       (B) educates State and local criminal law enforcement \n     officials on the prevention and prosecution of statutory \n     rape, focusing in\n\n[[Page S8410]]\n\n     particular on the commission of statutory rape by predatory \n     older men committing repeat offenses, and any links to \n     teenage pregnancy.\n       (c) ``Violence Against Women Initiative.--The Attorney \n     General shall ensure that the Department of Justice's \n     Violence Against Women initiative addresses the issue of \n     statutory rape, particularly the commission of statutory rape \n     by predatory older men committing repeat offenses.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Is there objection?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Reserving the right to object, could you give us an \nestimate as to how much time you might use?\n  Mr. DORGAN. I ask for 30 minutes and would expect not to use the \nentire 30 minutes.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I will not object so long as the Senator \nwould add that the time used, even though it is as in morning business, \nwould be charged against the time remaining on the bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I thank the Chair.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Dorgan and Mr. Byrd pertaining to the \nintroduction of S. 1978 are located in today's Record under \n``Statements on Introduced Bills and Joint Resolutions.'')\n  Mr. BUMPERS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Mack). The Senator from Arkansas.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, the Senator from Florida, Senator Graham, \noffered an amendment on behalf of himself and the Senator from Arkansas \nFriday afternoon. Unhappily, I was not here and did not get a chance to \nspeak on it. I would like to seize the opportunity now to just make a \nfew remarks.\n  Before doing that, I ask unanimous consent that I be permitted to \nyield to the Senator from North Dakota to allow him to lay down an \namendment without debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4948\n\n (Purpose: To strike provisions relating to the Indian child care set \n                                 aside)\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk sponsored \nby myself and cosponsored by Senator McCain and Senator Inouye.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from North Dakota [Mr. Dorgan], for himself, \n     Mr. McCain, and Mr. Inouye, proposes an amendment numbered \n     4948.\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n       In section 2813(1), strike subparagraph (B).\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I intend to discuss this amendment briefly \nat some point following the presentation by the Senator from Arkansas, \nand I very much appreciate his indulgence.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a moment?\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Yes.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. This is child support regarding Indians?\n  We passed it on voice vote on Thursday.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Will the Senator repeat that. I am sorry; I did not hear \nhim.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I just addressed the amendment sent to the desk.\n  Mr. DORGAN. It is a different amendment. It deals with the 3 percent \nset aside, and I do not believe it has been passed.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Could we have the amendment?\n  I thank the Senator.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4936\n\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, the amendment being offered by Senator \nGraham of Florida and me is the same one we offered last year. It might \nhave a few minor changes in it, but essentially it simply says that the \nblock grant formula in this welfare bill should be changed to take into \nconsideration the number of poor children in each State.\n  I am not very crazy about this bill to begin with, but I cannot \npossibly vote for a bill that discriminates against the State of \nArkansas to the extent this one does. It is not just Arkansas, it is \nparticularly Southern States, but a lot of other States get caught up \nin it, too.\n  Under the formula, the District of Columbia will get $4,222 for each \nwelfare recipient and the State of Arkansas will get $390. Why is a \nchild in the District of Columbia worth 11 times as much as a poor \nchild in Arkansas? That is a legitimate question, is it not?\n  I will tell you the answer. The answer is, through the years, the \nFederal Government has matched the States to some percentage or \nanother. It is not the same in every State. For example, in my State, \nbecause we are a relatively poor State, we get a big match, I think 73 \nto 75 percent. So for every dollar we put up, we get about $3 from the \nFederal Government. The District of Columbia does not do quite as well. \nBut the reason the District of Columbia gets such a staggering amount \nof money per child is because they have used a tremendous amount of \ntheir resources to put into the AFDC Program.\n  That is perfectly laudable and I am not criticizing the District of \nColumbia. But I will tell you something, and it gives me no joy to say \nit publicly, I come from a State which has one of the lowest per capita \nincomes in the Nation. We are a poor State. We have been ever since the \nWar Between the States. We have tried everything in the world and \ncontinue to strive to do everything we can to improve the plight of our \npeople. We tried to improve our\n\n[[Page S8411]]\n\neconomy so there would be more jobs and better paying jobs, and in the \npast several years we have met with some success. But we are not New \nYork, California, or New Jersey in per capita income.\n  The reason this bill is fundamentally flawed and unfair is because it \nsays to you, the State of Arkansas, this is what you have received for \nthe last 3 years, 1991 through 1994, and that is what you are going to \ncontinue to receive. In short, if you were poor, no matter how hard you \ntried to do better under the AFDC program, if you were poor and simply \ncould not do it, it is tough.\n  What does this bill do? It says we are locking you in on the basis of \nwhat you got during that 3-year period. I do not care if you had \nfloods, tornadoes, if you had a wave of immigrants move into your \nState, which brings a lot of poverty to States like Florida, you are \nstill going to get what you got for 3 years, on average. There is a \nlittle 2\\1/2\\ percent ``gimmie'' in the bill, but not enough to amount \nto anything.\n  One of the things that really is a travesty in this bill is the \ntreatment of AFDC administrative costs. I hate to say these things \nbecause I am not jumping on other States. I am simply trying to defend \nmy own. But look what has happened in New York and New Jersey. The \nnationwide average, in 1994, of administrative costs for administering \nthe program we have now was $53.42. During that same period of time, \nthe average cost of administering the program in New York was $106.68 \nand in New Jersey $105.26. What do we do under this bill? We lock that \nadministrative cost in and say we will continue to compensate you, no \nmatter how inefficient you may have been.\n  I am sorry the Senator from West Virginia left the floor. The average \nadministrative cost for administering the AFDC Program in West Virginia \nis $13.34, and that is what they are going to get through the year 2000 \nif this bill passes, while New York will be receiving eight times as \nmuch. We are going to give them that, lock them in, no matter how \ninefficient they may be in administering the program.\n  One of the interesting things about this bill was pointed out in the \nNew York Times this morning. Let us take my State as an example, and \nlet us assume push comes to shove and we are running out of money, we \nare suddenly not going to be able to continue. The Federal Government \nsays, ``That's tough, we gave you the block grant, you have to live \nwith it. We do not care how many poor children you have, we are going \nto give you what you got as an average between 1991 and 1994, and you \nwill live with it. Do not come back up here with your hand out.''\n  Do you know what they allow the States to do? Kick people off \nwelfare. Each State can make it's work requirements as stringent as \nthey want to make them. What does the Federal Government do in such a \ncase? We do not say, ``If you kick those people off welfare we are \ngoing to quit giving you the money for that family.'' We continue to \ngive them the money for the family. So there is an incentive to the \nStates, if they have any difficulty at all with the program, to kick \npeople off, knowing they are going to continue to get the same amount \nof money.\n  I do not want to take too much time. I know there is not a lot of \ntime between now and 2 o'clock when we go to the agricultural \nappropriations bill. But one of the most troubling things about this \nbill, completely aside from this grossly unfair funding formula, is \nthat I have heard people in the U.S. Senate and in Congress say things \nthat are so punitive in nature. It is as though we are passing this \nbill to punish people for being poor. You can call that bleeding heart \nliberalism--call it whatever you want to call it. I am not for keeping \npeople on the welfare cycle. I am for reforming welfare, to make jobs a \nlot more attractive to those people. I am for reforming welfare so \nwomen can have day care for their children and get job training and \nfind a job, preferably one that provides health care so we do not have \nto pay for Medicaid for them.\n  But in the debate, just to use my own State as an example, there is \nsort of the suggestion that the youngsters, the babies that are born in \nCollege Station, AR, which is an unspeakably poor area, have the same \nopportunities as the children born in Pleasant Valley, our most \naffluent suburb. And everybody who does not happen to make it as well \nas the people in Pleasant Valley, somehow or another we seem to think \nthey are lowdown.\n  I said on the floor before and I will say it again, my brother went \nto Harvard Law School, courtesy of the taxpayers of the United States \non the GI bill. We have a little difficult time sometimes discussing \nthese issues, but I remind him that it was more than Harvard Law School \nthat made him successful.\n  I would not be a U.S. Senator if I had not been able to go to a good \nlaw school, like Northwestern, also compliments of the U.S. Government, \nwho paid for all of it, except what Betty made working.\n  So I remind my brother about the largess of the Federal Government, \nwhich I have been trying to pay back all of my life, by thanking the \ntaxpayers, being a good public servant, and doing my dead-level best to \nmake this a better country for my children and grandchildren to grow up \nin. But I also remind my brother that we were also fortunate because we \nchose our parents well. These AFDC children did not choose their \nparents well. Somehow there is a certain vindictiveness, a punitive \naspect to this bill toward those children, a lot of whom are going to \nsuffer under the terms of this bill, and suffer a lot, because they had \nthe temerity not to choose their parents well.\n  So, I do not have any trouble voting against this bill, especially \nbecause it discriminates against my State in a totally unacceptable \nway. I know my State. I was Governor of my State. I know where the \nmoney comes from, and I know where it goes. We have areas along the \nMississippi River, which we call the delta, and if we are going to pass \na bill to alleviate the tax burden on people in the District of \nColumbia because their people are moving out because of crime or the \ntax rate or something else, I want to include the delta.\n  I can tell you, you will not find an inner city in America with more \ndeplorable poverty than you will find in the delta of Mississippi and \nArkansas. So I want them to have the same break.\n  As I say, if we were not struggling to do the best we can, I would \nnot object. But we do not have the money that New York, New Jersey, \nCalifornia, and other States have to put into this program. It is not \njust Arkansas. Mr. President, your home State of Florida, as you know \nall too well without me saying it, will lose $1 billion under this \nbill.\n  The two Senators from Texas voted against the Graham-Bumpers proposal \nlast year--and I assume they will do it again--and it cost the State of \nTexas $3 billion. And on it goes. It is a grossly unfair formula. It is \nindefensible.\n  In this morning's New York Times, my position is vindicated at least \nby one columnist, David Ellwood, who is professor of public policy at \nHarvard School of Government. He says, and this is just a portion of \nit:\n\n       States would get block grants to use for welfare and work \n     programs. But the grants for child care, job training, \n     workfare, and cash assistance combined would amount to less \n     than $15 per poor child per week in * * * Mississippi and \n     Arkansas.\n\n  Mr. President, $15 a week for all of those things.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. BUMPERS. I will be happy to yield.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Does that not mean that is what they are getting now?\n  Mr. BUMPERS. I beg your pardon?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Does that not mean that is what they are getting now?\n  Mr. BUMPERS. It means that is what they have gotten as an average for \n1991 and 1994.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Are you suggesting it is appreciably better than 1994?\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Well, I am sure it is somewhat better.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Will the formula become more satisfactory if it was \nbrought to 1995? I do not think we got the evidence. My point is, \nhowever we go--I do not know which way the Senate is going to go--the \ntruth of the matter is, those poor children you are speaking of in \nthose two States are not getting very much now. That is the reason they \nare not going to get very much under this bill.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. They are not going to get very much, but why do you want\n\n[[Page S8412]]\n\nto lock in an inequity? You say it has always been unequal but want to \nlock it in?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I did not say that. I wanted to make sure the Record \nreflected when you expressed yourself--and I have great respect for \nyou. You are representing a cause and an approach that ought to be \nlooked at carefully. But when you say they are only going to get $15 on \naverage, it has to be made clear they are not getting much more than \n$15 now.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. That's true, they are not getting much more than that. I \ncan tell you the number of poor children in my State is higher by far \nthan the national average.\n  What I am saying is that if you want to address the problems of poor \npeople, go where the poor people are, not where the people are more \naffluent. That is the reason I object; I object to these staggering \nsums going to the other States.\n  In 1994, Arkansas had a terrible Medicaid shortage of funds. We could \nnot come up with our matching share to the extent that was necessary to \nprovide health care for all of our poor children. Do you know what the \nState legislature did under the Governor's leadership? They passed one \nof the most unpopular taxes you can pass in any State. It was a nickel \na bottle on soft drinks, and the money it raised kept us from kicking \npeople out of nursing homes, and it kept us from having poor children \non the streets who need health care and are not able to get it.\n  That is the reason I am complaining today. It was a monumental effort \non the part of Arkansas to come up with our share of the money so we \ncould take care of our children.\n  So here we have a formula that says in the future you are going to \nget $390 a year per poor child. And there are 38 additional States that \nwill be hurt by this bill. You would think it would be adopted with \nflying colors.\n  If I may continue with the article from Mr. Ellwood of the New York \nTimes:\n\n       Governor Thompson says he can make reform succeed with \n     block grants. But the legislation provides more than three \n     times as much money per poor child in wealthier States like \n     Wisconsin, California, and New York as it does for many \n     States with much higher levels of poverty. Even if they \n     wanted to, there is no way poor States could carry out plans \n     like Governor Thompson's.\n\n  Here is a man who spent his entire life studying this problem. He \ncloses this article by saying:\n\n       Welfare politics has turned ugly.\n       Rhetoric has replaced reality: saying a bill is about work \n     or that cuts are in the best interests of children does not \n     make it so. Apparently the legislation is being driven by \n     election-year fears. But Members of Congress and President \n     Clinton need to stand up for our children. This bill should \n     not be passed. If legislation like this is adopted, I hope \n     the President vetoes it in the name of real welfare reform.\n\n  Mr. President, I spoke about election-year issues the other day in \nthe Energy Committee, on which I sit, when we were dealing with the \nBoundary Water Canoe Wilderness Area, about 1,100 lakes along the \nMinnesota-Canadian border. I went out there in 1978 for Wendy Anderson, \nwho was serving in the Senate from the State of Minnesota at the time \nand with whom I served as Governor. The Boundary Water Canoe Wilderness \nArea came up the year Wendy was running for re-election. It was a big \npolitical issue. Wendy lost his seat, not for that reason only. But he \nlost plenty of votes because of the Boundary Water Canoe Wilderness \nArea dispute.\n  Now we have another big Boundary Water Canoe Wilderness Area dispute \nin Minnesota. I am not taking sides on that necessarily, but there are \na lot of ads being run in Minnesota right now. I said in the \ncommittee--and I mean it--I will do everything I can to keep a bill of \nthis kind from passing this year, because it is entirely too important \nfor the U.S. Congress to be dealing with in an election year.\n  That is exactly the way I feel about this welfare bill. It ought to \nbe passed next year, not now in an election year where everybody is \ntrying to grow hair on their chest to prove they are tougher on welfare \nthan everyone else. But we are not going to wait. As a consequence, we \nare getting ready to pass a bad bill.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the article by David T. \nEllwood in the New York Times be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                      Welfare Reform in Name Only\n\n                         (By David T. Ellwood)\n\n       Bondurant, Wy.--I have spent much of my professional life \n     seeking to reform welfare. I have worked with Republican and \n     Democratic governors. And until I returned to academia a year \n     ago, I was fortunate to be a co-chairman of President \n     Clinton's welfare reform effort. I deeply believe that the \n     well-being of the nation's children depends on real reform. \n     We must turn away from the failed system focused on \n     determining eligibility and check writing and create a new \n     one based on work and responsibility.\n       But the Republican bills in the House and Senate are far \n     more about budget-cutting than work. Bathed in the rhetoric \n     of reform, they are more dangerous than most people realize. \n     No bill that is likely to push more than a million additional \n     children into poverty--many in working families--is real \n     reform.\n       Proponents claim the bills are about work, and the \n     legislation does obligate states to require large numbers of \n     recipients to work. Fair enough. Serious work requirements \n     are crucial to meaningful change. But it's one thing to write \n     work into legislation, and it's another to get recipients \n     jobs.\n       Gov. Tommy Thompson of Wisconsin, a Republican, has \n     emphasized that reform often involves spending more, not \n     less, money on things like job training and child care. \n     Instead, the Congressional bills would make major cuts--\n     reducing food stamps for the working poor, aid to disabled \n     children and to legal immigrants who are not yet citizens. \n     When the dust settles, there would not be much money for \n     welfare reform at all.\n       States would get block grants to use for welfare and work \n     programs. But the grants for child care, job training, \n     workfare and cash assistance combined would amount to less \n     than $15 per poor child per week in poor Southern states like \n     Mississippi and Arkansas. Moving people from welfare to work \n     is hard. On $15 a week--whom are we kidding?\n       Governor Thompson says he can make reform succeed with \n     block grants. But the legislation provides more than three \n     times as much money per poor child in wealthier states like \n     Wisconsin, California and New York as it does for many states \n     with much higher levels of poverty. Even if they wanted to, \n     there is no way poor states could carry out plans like \n     Governor Thompson's.\n       States cannot and will not do the impossible. The \n     legislation gives them an out. They may set time limits of \n     any length and simply cut families off welfare regardless of \n     their circumstances--and still get their full Federal block \n     grants.\n       It won't matter if the people want to work. It won't matter \n     if they would happily take workfare jobs so they could \n     provide something for their families. It won't matter if \n     there are no private jobs available.\n       States may want to offer workfare jobs, but limited Federal \n     grants may preclude that. People who are willing to work but \n     are unable to find a job should not be abandoned. If they \n     are, what happens to their children?\n       What is dangerous about the Republican legislation is not \n     that it gives states the lead or reduces Federal rules. \n     States really are the source of most creative work on true \n     reform. Witness the approximately 40 states for which some \n     Federal regulations have been waived.\n       It is worrisome that this legislation places new and often \n     mean-spirited demands on states while changing the social and \n     financial rules of the game in a way that strongly encourages \n     cutting support rather than getting people jobs.\n       What is particularly distressing about the pre-election \n     rush to enact legislation is that significant reform is \n     finally starting at the state level, with active support from \n     the Clinton Administration. Some remarkably exciting ideas \n     (as well as some alarming ones) are being tried. There is no \n     evidence that a lack of Federal legislation has seriously \n     slowed this momentum.\n       Indeed, President Clinton has talked about issuing an \n     executive order requiring states to put people to work after \n     two years--without new legislation and without any danger of \n     sizable rises in child poverty or major benefit cuts. Passing \n     the legislation now in Congress seems far more likely to slow \n     reform than speed it--and it could result not in greater \n     independence of poor families but in a spiral of ever-\n     increasing desperation.\n       Welfare politics has turned ugly. Rhetoric has replaced \n     reality: saying a bill is about work or that cuts are in the \n     best interests of children does not make it so. Apparently \n     the legislation is being driven by election-year fears. But \n     members of Congress and President Clinton need to stand up \n     for our children. These bills should not be passed. And if \n     legislation like this is adopted, I hope the President vetoes \n     it in the name of real welfare reform.\n\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DOMENICI addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I am certain that we will have some \narguments in opposition to the amendment for doing the formula \ndifferently than Senator Bumpers has addressed. I am\n\n[[Page S8413]]\n\ntrying to see if one of those who is from the committee that wrote the \nbill would come down and do that. If not, I will address the issue.\n  But I say, the part of your argument--I say this to Senator Bumpers--\nthat says we ought to put this matter off, I do not think so. I think \nyou ought to get your chance here to present your case. I think we \nought to proceed.\n  Part of the argument you make indicates that we have waited far too \nlong to do something to reform this system and reforming the system in \nthe context I am speaking of right now. I am not necessarily speaking \nabout the workfare approach. It is way past due for that.\n  But essentially we have sat by for years since AFDC, a cash program, \ncame into being decades ago. We have let it develop to the extent it \nhas characteristics of the type you are speaking to. Obviously, poor \nStates were given the option to have very poor programs. But if we \nwould have told them, ``You ought to have richer programs,'' they would \nhave said, ``We can't afford any richer program.''\n  A State like New York, which you speak of, has very, very high taxes. \nThey have had a very, very liberal approach to taxing their people. \nThus, they can put up a lot of money for welfare. Since it is a high-\npay State, they decided to have a very hefty welfare program. As a \nmatter of fact, they have plenty of poor people in spite of all that.\n  I did not interrupt when you said we ought to put the money where the \npoor people are, but I would venture to say that there are far more \npoor people in the State of New York than there are in three or four of \nthe States you spoke of combined, certainly more than Arkansas, \nMississippi, States of that size.\n  Just because New York has a very high wage scale does not mean there \nare not a lot of poor people there. But the problem is, we are \nconfronted with a welfare program that grew in an environment where we \nasked States to match. We gave them options as to how much they wanted \nto put into welfare. We even gave them options of how much they would \npay the beneficiaries and how much per child in a welfare home. We have \njust left it there for years and did not do anything about it.\n  Now we have States with hardly a program in terms of real dollars and \nStates like New York, which has spent a lot of money on the program. \nSooner or later we have to decide, in reform, what do we do about that? \nPerhaps you suggest that you have a better idea on what we do to make \nthat a situation in the future that is not as bad as you see it in the \npast. But this is not an easy one. Nor is it an easy one in Medicare. \nYou addressed Medicare for a fleeting moment about----\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Medicaid.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Excuse me. Medicaid. About your State being unable to \npay. One of the things we are forgetting here in the United States and \nin this land when we debate Medicaid reform is that States cannot \nafford the Medicaid Program we are telling them to have.\n  Your State fell short of money a few years ago. Mine is short this \nyear. There is $21 million they do not have to pay for the program in \nMedicaid. We only match it with 25 cents on the dollar. I do not know \nwhat yours is, but I would imagine, considering the profile of poverty, \nthe demographics of poverty, you are probably at a 25-percent match, \nmeaning that the Feds pay most of it, but it is so expensive to provide \nthe service under the current system the States cannot even pay for it.\n  If we think here the evolution of a formula in transition was \ndifficult for welfare, it is much more difficult on Medicaid because of \nthe very same facts, plus the program is much, much more encompassing \nin terms of how many billions of dollars it spent. Welfare is a small \nprogram in terms of the dollars spent on Medicaid, even in your State \nand my State.\n  So it is not going to be easy to come up with a formula because we \nhave let them grow up side by side with States like New York and States \nlike Arkansas and States like Mississippi or New Mexico. I take that \nback. New Mexico's welfare program is in the middle of the ranks. Its \nMedicaid is about in the middle of the Nation.\n  So I would have asked that Harvard professor who wrote that article \nyou quoted from--it sounded brilliant--I would ask--maybe he has done \nit--but where is his welfare program? He says we ought to have welfare \nreform. We need one. It is easy to say, throw one out. We need one. We \nhave to make some decisions and get on with trying it. I yield the \nfloor at this point.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. I wonder if the Senator would yield for a moment? Would \nthe Senator yield for a unanimous consent request?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I would be pleased to.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Let me make one other observation, because I know the \nSenator has labored in the vineyard a long time on welfare. It is one \nof those issues for which the time never seems right. I said we ought \nto do it next year. We tried to do it last year, which was not an \nelection year. It did not work out.\n  But I think the Senator, for whom I have the utmost respect--and when \nI talk about Members of Congress that seem to lack some compassion, I \nam certainly not talking about my friend from New Mexico. I know he has \nlabored long and hard for this. It is a complex issue. The deeper I got \ninto it on this amendment, the more complex it became.\n  But I will say this--and I think the Senator would agree with me--you \ncannot make a program like this work, not the way it ought to work, \nwhen, for example, a child in Massachusetts or New York or someplace \nelse is worth 10 times as much as a child in Arkansas or Mississippi. \nWe are not ever going to get our act together when we have that much \ndisparity. I am not saying there does not have to be effort, because \neffort is important.\n  Some of these States have made monumental efforts. But effort is a \ncomparative thing. We have made efforts, too. Compared to some others \nmaybe it was not as great. When the Senator talks about how many poor \nchildren there are in New York, I know the Senator is correct when he \nsays there are probably more poor children in New York than there are \nin Mississippi, Alabama, and Arkansas put together.\n  But we are talking about poor children as a percentage of the \npopulation. We are talking about how many poor children you have \ncompared to all the children in the State or all the people in the \nState. When you get to that point, New York is not in the running with \nArkansas. I want to say to the Senator from New Mexico, I appreciate \nhis comments. As I say, I have the utmost respect for his efforts to \nget this bill passed and all the effort he has made in the past. I just \nhappen to disagree with him. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DOMENICI addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I wonder if we could do this, I say to Senator Bumpers. \nThe time is 1 o'clock. We are going to be finished and run out of time \nat 2 o'clock. I want to offer an opportunity for a couple of Senators \nwho would be very adversely affected by the Senator's amendment to \nspeak, not as long as the Senator did, but for some period of time. I \nam going to make one observation and then ask consent.\n  I say to Senators, they should know, for instance, under this \namendment the State of Arkansas will have 151 percent increase; the \nState of Louisiana will have 170 percent; New Mexico would have an \nincrease of 3 percent; California would have a reduction of $1.2 \nbillion, a 31 percent reduction, New York a reduction of 49 percent; \nMassachusetts, 50 percent; and on and on. I think some of those \nSenators might want to come down and make their case as to why the \nformula should be based on what they have been putting into the program \nduring the immediate past decade or so.\n  Having said that, I ask unanimous consent we set aside the Bumpers \namendment, but from the Republican side we reserve up to 10 minutes of \nthe hour that we might have in rebuttal, and that Senator Bumpers be \nallowed, if that occurs, an additional 5 minutes, if we use 10.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Either Senator Graham or myself.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, let me make one other observation: \nAccording the charts Senator Graham has compiled, I do not know where \nthe Senator got the figure that we will get such a\n\n[[Page S8414]]\n\nbig increase. The truth is we will get $282 million less per capita \nover the next 6 years simply because we are using the 1991 and 1994 \nformula.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I will be happy to make available the formula of the \nCongressional Research Service, July 18, 1996. This formula has a chart \nfor the increase in every State, and we just took your increase and put \nthe percentage on it. That is where we got that number. We will be \nhappy to make the chart available.\n  Mr. President, let me make one last point, then we will move to the \nnext amendment. I use this time off the bill.\n  Mr. President, whatever the distinguished Senator from Arkansas has \nsaid relative to what we have been paying as part of the welfare \nprogram of the United States for children and this huge disparity of 10 \nto 1, the point I want to make is that is not the feature of this bill. \nThat is what has transpired over time. It is the reality today. Maybe \nSenator Bumpers and others would say that is why welfare has failed. I \ndid not hear that before. I thought it was some other characteristic, \nbut that is the truth.\n  Now we are confronted with, if you are going to change the basic \nquality of welfare and what is expected, what do you do about that \nfinancial disparity that existed over time, which is extreme. This bill \ntends to perpetuate that for 5 years in the form of a block grants, but \nthere is a lot of flexibility added.\n  I do not want to speak to that amendment any more because we reserved \ntime. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, just prior to Senator Bumpers making his \nstatement, I offered an amendment. This is not the amendment that was \nagreed to last week. This is a different amendment. We have provided \nthe amendment, I believe, or at least discussed it with both sides.\n  I wanted to take just 2 or 3 minutes to discuss that amendment, and I \nalso wanted to introduce a second amendment which I believe is going to \nbe agreed to. I am offering the second amendment on behalf of Senator \nDaschle, myself, Senator Domenici and Senator McCain. It is an \namendment that has been worked out by both sides to exempt certain \nindividuals living in areas of low labor market participation from the \n5-year limitation on assistance.\n  If I might, in a capsule, point out that the welfare reform bill \nprovides a 20-percent exemption that is available to the States. What \nwe could have and likely would have are circumstances where there are \nareas in which virtually no jobs are available and you have very high \nunemployment. That situation would soak up the exemption almost \nimmediately. This amendment addresses and corrects that and provides \nsome more flexibility to the States.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4949\n\n (Purpose: To exempt certain individuals living in areas of low labor \n     market participation from the 5-year limitation on assistance)\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. I offer this amendment, and I send it to the desk.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I ask unanimous consent that the amendment be in order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Jeffords). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from North Dakota [Mr. Dorgan], for Mr. \n     Daschle, for himself, Mr. Dorgan, Mr. Domenici, and Mr. \n     McCain, proposes an amendment No. 4949.\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. I ask unanimous consent the reading of the amendment be \ndispensed.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n       On page 250, line 2, strike ``and (C)'' and insert ``, (C), \n     and (D)''.\n       On page 252, between lines 9 and 10, insert the following:\n       ``(D) Exception for extremely low labor market \n     participation.--\n       ``(i) In general.--In determining the number of months for \n     which an adult received assistance under the State program \n     funded under this part, the State may disregard any and all \n     months in which the individual resided in an area of \n     extremely low labor market participation (as defined under \n     clause (ii).\n       ``(ii) Extremely low labor market participation area.--For \n     purposes of clause (i), an adult is considered to be living \n     in an area of extremely low labor market participation if \n     such adult resides on a reservation of an Indian Tribe--\n       ``(I) with a population of at least 1,000 individuals; and\n       ``(II) with at least 50% of the adult population not \n     employed, as determined by the Secretary using the best \n     available data from a Federal agency.\n       On page 252, line 10, strike ``(D)'' and insert ``(E)''.\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I am a cosponsor, and I indicate so that \neverybody would understand this does not say this is mandated. This \nsays that the Governors, in putting together their plan for their \nState, can, if they find an area--and this is pretty much going to be \nIndian areas, I believe, because of the enormous unemployment number; \nit is 50 percent--it will be available as a flexible tool in terms of \nputting together packages.\n  Mr. DORGAN. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. We accept the amendment on our side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 4949) was agreed to.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I move to table the amendment.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I move to reconsider the vote.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4948\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, if I might just for a couple of minutes \naddress the previous amendment that I offered that deals with the \ntribal child care set-aside. I hope we perhaps might be able to see \nthis amendment accepted before we go to votes tomorrow.\n  The amendment I have offered on behalf of myself, Senator McCain, and \nSenator Inouye, restores the current set-aside for Indian child care \nfunding. The current set-aside is 3 percent of the child care \ndevelopment block grant, which is now available to Indian tribes for \nchild care. The welfare reform bill cuts that 3 percent down to 1 \npercent.\n  The funds the Indian tribes are now able to access with the child \ncare development block grant have been very important. They have \nallowed the tribes to successfully run a wide range of child care \nprograms. In 1994, that set-aside helped more than 500 tribes provide \nchild care.\n  Last year, when the welfare reform bills passed both the House and \nthe Senate, they retained the 3-percent set-aside for tribal child care \nprograms. The conference bill inexplicably reduced that tribal \nallocation from 3 percent to 1 percent, the same level that is now \ncontained in this reconciliation bill.\n  The reduction in the tribal set-aside occurs at the very same time \nthat State child care funds would increase substantially. The question \nI ask is, if an increase in child care is critical to State efforts to \nmove people from welfare to work, and I believe it is, then why is it \nnot also critical for real welfare reform in Indian country and for \nIndian tribes to provide child care?\n  I want to make a point that Indian children under age 6 are more than \ntwice as likely as the average child in America to live in \ncircumstances of poverty. Indian children under 6 who live on \nreservations are three times more likely to live in circumstances of \npoverty than non-Indian children.\n  I toured, not so long ago, a child care center on a facility in North \nDakota that is jointly run by four tribes, United Tribes Technical \nCollege. It is a wonderful place where American Indians come to receive \neducational and vocational training. They study, they graduate, they go \nout and get work. That center is run by a wonderful man named David \nGipp, who does an extraordinarily good job. They have a child care \ncenter at U-Tech. I have toured that child care center a couple of \ntimes.\n  U-Tech reminds you of the need and the importance of child care in \nthis building-block process to move people from welfare to work. You \nhave to be able to get the job skills. Often, to get job skills, if you \nhave children, you have to try to find child care. All of us know that \nit is not just in Indian country, but across this country, \nincreasingly, that poverty is a problem often faced by young women with \nchildren in single-parent households.\n  Now, when they try to get skills and then get a job, the question is, \nWhat\n\n[[Page S8415]]\n\nkind of child care can they access to take care of their children? To \nthem, just like in every other household, the most important thing in \ntheir lives are their children. They want to make sure the children \nhave an opportunity. If they go to work, when they go to work, they \nwant to have an opportunity to place their children in child care in a \nplace where they have some confidence and trust. That is why this \namendment is so important.\n  It breaks your heart to take a look at what is happening in some \nareas of the country with very high unemployment, especially Indian \nreservations, with people who want an opportunity to work. They want a \njob. On many of these reservations--and we have a couple in North \nDakota--there virtually are no jobs. If you look at the map and try to \nfigure out, where do we carve out a reservation and say these are \nIndian reservations, do you think they carved out the fertile Red River \nValley? No. They carved out reservations where there are no great \nopportunities and where there has not been a substantial amount of \neconomic activity, not very many jobs, not very many companies moving \nin to provide opportunities.\n  As we attempt to decide how to reform the welfare system--and we \nshould, because it does not work very well--we need to understand that \nthe two linchpins that can help people move from welfare to work are \nchild care and health care. The absence of one or both means that you \ncannot succeed in moving someone from welfare to work. The presence of \nboth means that you can say to people that we expect something from you \nin response to what we are going to offer for you. Part of that is job \ntraining and employment, but also attendant to it is adequate and \nproper child care. I do hope that, between now and tomorrow, we might \nfind an opportunity to see whether this amendment might be accepted.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the amendment \noffered by my colleague, Senator Dorgan. The amendment ensures that \nIndian tribes will continue to receive 3 percent of funding provided \nunder the child care development block grant program, as it stands \nunder current law.\n  I am pleased that the proposed budget reconciliation measure under \nconsideration includes provisions which I and other Senators sponsored \nto address the unique needs and requirements of Indian country to \ndirectly administer welfare programs.\n  Mr. President, welfare assistance programs are intended to protect \npoor people and children. As reported, the bill does not go far enough \nto ensure that Indian tribes, particularly Indian children, who are the \nmost vulnerable of our population and among the poorest of the poor, \nwill be protected. Indian children under the age of 6 are more than \ntwice as likely as the average non-Indian child to live in poverty. \nIndian children under the age of 6 residing on Indian reservations are \nthree times more likely than non-Indian children to live in poverty.\n  The need in Indian country is enormous and far outweighs the limited \nFederal dollars allocated to Indian tribal governments. Because the \nneed for assistance to Indian children is so compelling, I have been \nquite concerned that the reported bill reduced the tribal allocation \nfrom 3 percent to 1 percent. Such a cut would have harmed tribal \nefforts to bring more Indian people into the work force and resulted in \ndiminishment of existing tribal child care programs.\n  Mr. President, I believe we should maintain the 3-percent-funding \nallocation under present law to ensure that Indian children receive an \nequal and fair opportunity to a brighter future as is provided to all \nother American children. This commitment also honors the unique trust \nrelationship that the United States has with Indian tribal governments.\n  I am pleased that we have reached agreement to adopt this amendment \nand thank Senator Domenici, chairman of the Budget Committee, and \nSenator Roth, chairman of the Finance Committee, for accepting it. I \nalso want to thank Senator Dorgan for once again demonstrating his \ncommitment to improve the lives of Indian children. I urge my \ncolleagues to work diligently at conference with the House to ensure \nthat the welfare bill we send to the President maintains this \nprovision.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4934\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I want to make one additional comment, not \non this amendment, but on the one offered by Senator Conrad. That \namendment is the issue of the optional food stamp block grant.\n  My understanding of the amendment is that the block grant option that \nexists in the bill is a problem, and the amendment would repeal the \nblock grant. The amendment's supporters believe--and I firmly believe--\nthat if we decide that it is a function of national will, a national \nobjective to decide that those who do not have enough to eat, then we \nare going to try to help get them some food.\n  If that is a national issue, it is not an issue between one county \nand another county, or one State and another State, or one city and \nanother city. It is an issue of national determination that we do not \nwant people in this country to be hungry. We do not want kids to go \nwithout meals. We want to develop a national standard that makes sure \nthis country, as good and generous and as strong as this country is, \ncan feed those people among us who have suffered some difficulties, who \nwere unfortunate enough to be born into circumstances of poverty, who \nhave had some other disadvantages, and who find themselves down and \nout, down on their luck, and also hungry.\n  We know what to do about hunger. This is not some mysterious disease \nfor which there is no cure. We know what causes hunger and how to \nresolve it.\n  Part of this bill deals with the issues of resolving hunger and \nhelping people get prepared for the workplace. Another part says you \ncannot prepare 8-year-olds for a job. We ought not to prepare 10-year-\nolds for a job. If we have kids living in poverty, or grownups living \nin poverty, we want to make sure that we have a system to say that we \nwill help them get back on their feet. While we are helping them get \nback on their feet, we do not want them to be hungry--kids, adults, \nanybody in this country. That is why we have had a Food Stamp Program. \nIs it perfect? No. Has it worked well? Sure. We ought not, in any way, \ndecide that we should retreat from that. That is why I so strongly \nsupport the amendment offered by Senator Conrad and Senator Jeffords.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4948\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, on the amendment which is pending, with \nreference to the 1 versus 3 percent set-aside, we have cleared this \nwith the committee of jurisdiction. What will happen when we adopt this \namendment is that we will return the percentage to its current law. \nThis is a ceiling, not a mandated level. For those reasons, the \ncommittee indicates that we will accept it on our side.\n  Therefore, I yield back any time on the amendment and indicate that \nwe are willing to accept the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time is yielded back.\n  The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 4948) was agreed to.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I thank the Senator for offering the amendment.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I thank the Senator from New Mexico for his help.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4950\n\n (Purpose: To strike amendments to the summer food service program for \n                               children)\n\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Kentucky [Mr. Ford], for Mrs. Murray, \n     proposes an amendment numbered 4950.\n\n\n[[Page S8416]]\n\n\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       Strike section 1206.\n\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, Senator Murray is unavoidably detained. I am \nproposing her amendment.\n  This is an amendment she discussed last week and withdrew with the \nopportunity to be able to submit it today. It strikes section 1206. The \nbill reduces the rate of the Summer Food Service Program.\n  The Food Research Action Council's surveys and past experience leads \nthem to conclude that the cut could result in:\n  A 30- to 35-percent drop in the number of sponsors;\n  A 20-percent cut in the number of children participating;\n  Many larger sponsors dropping their smaller sites;\n  A significant decline in meat quality as sponsors cut food costs.\n  I ask unanimous consent that ``the need for the Murray amendment \nstriking provisions relating to the Summer Food Program'' be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       The need for the Murray amendment striking provisions \n     relating to the summer food program:\n       The Senate bill makes an eleven percent cut to the \n     reimbursement rate for lunches provided in the summer food \n     program. The reduction (a 23/20 cent cut on each lunch, from \n     $2.16/$2.12 to $1.93) is substantial. Many programs around \n     the country serve 50 or fewer children. Over half of current \n     sponsors already lose money under current rates. Their \n     margins to absorb cuts are extremely narrow. Estimates vary \n     by state, but the Food Research Action Council's surveys and \n     past experience lead them to conclude that the cut could \n     result in: a 30-35 percent drop in the number of sponsors \n     (especially in rural districts); a 20 percent cut in the \n     number of children participating; many larger sponsors \n     dropping their smaller sites; weaker supervision and \n     monitoring and a decline in program integrity; a significant \n     decline in meal quality as sponsors cut food costs; and very \n     few new sponsors. It is already difficult to recruit new \n     sponsors, even though only one in six eligible children \n     receive meals. The recruitment of new sponsors by advocacy \n     groups would likely stop, and with it, future growth.\n       The effect of the amendment:\n       Strikes section 1206 of the bill, which reduces the rates \n     for the Summer Food Program.\n\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum. We \nare not going to respond yet. We are just beginning to understand the \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4951\n\n              (Purpose: To provide additional amendments)\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I offer in behalf of Senator Roth \ntechnical amendments to the bill. These have been requested by the \nFinance Committee and been approved and recommended for adoption by the \nmajority and the minority of the Finance Committee. I send the \ntechnical amendments to the desk and ask for their immediate \nconsideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows.\n\n       The Senator from New Mexico [Mr. Domenici], for Mr. Roth, \n     proposes an amendment numbered 4951.\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Senator from Florida is recognized.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. I rise for purposes of offering an amendment. I send an \namendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows.\n\n       The Senator from Florida [Mr. Graham] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 4952:\n       Strike section 409(a)(3)(C) of the Social Security Act, as \n     added by section 2103(a)(1).\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, as read, the purpose of this motion to \nstrike is to strike section 409(a)(3)(C) which was added to this bill \nduring its consideration before the Senate Finance Committee. The \nprovision which I would offer to strike provides:\n\n       Notwithstanding the limitation described in Subparagraph \n     (A), the Secretary shall reduce the grant payable to the \n     State . . . for a fiscal year, in addition to the reduction \n     imposed under subsection (A), by an amount equal to 5 percent \n     of the State family assistance grant, if the Secretary \n     determines that the State failed to comply with section \n     407(a) for 2 or more consecutive preceding fiscal years.\n\n  That language was added in the Senate Finance Committee to language \nthat had been in the bill in its previous form, in its current \nreconciliation version, as well as in other versions of welfare reform. \nThat previous version states that the Secretary can sanction a State \nwhich fails to meet its work requirements by an amount up to 5 percent \nof the State's family assistance grant.\n  The amendment that was offered, first, removes the discretion from \nthe Secretary; second, instead of saying up to 5 percent, it makes it \nan absolute 5 percent in addition to whatever sanction has been levied \nin the previous fiscal year against a State which failed to meet its \nwork requirement.\n  Why am I offering this amendment? I am offering it, first, because \nthe language of the amendment is very obscure. In its claimed reading, \nit seems to say that there will be an additional amount, equal to 5 \npercent of the State's family assistance grant, as a sanction if the \nState had failed for 2 consecutive years to meet its work requirements. \nThat, apparently, is not the way it is being interpreted by others, \nincluding one of the groups which is strongly opposed to this \nprovision, which is the National Conference of State Legislatures. They \nare interpreting this to be a cumulative sanction. That it would be, if \nyou failed to meet your work requirements for 2 consecutive years and \nhad been subject to a penalty because of failure to do so, you would be \nsubject to an additional mandatory 5-percent cut in the third year; an \nadditional 5-percent cut, or a cumulative 15 percent in the next year; \nan additional 5 percent in the year after that, up to a maximum of a \n25-percent reduction in your grant.\n  So one of my concerns with this very important provision that was \nadded--frankly, as a member of the Finance Committee, I can stipulate, \nwithout any consideration by the committee--is, just what does it mean? \nIt could be very draconian in its impact. It could be only very \nserious.\n  So that is one issue. A second issue is the fact that the States, \nthrough the organizations that we have looked to, to do much of the \npolicy work for a bill which purports to grant increased authority to \nStates, are opposed to this provision.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have a series of letters from State-based \norganizations printed at the conclusion of my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. GRAHAM. I would like to use, illustrative of the letters I \nreceived, this letter dated today, July 22, from the National \nConference of State Legislatures. This letter states, in part:\n\n       State legislators want welfare reform to succeed. In order \n     to succeed, we need adequate implementation time to craft \n     comprehensive welfare reform that best fits the needs in our \n     individual states. In S. 1956, both the work participation \n     rate requirements and penalties begin the first year of the \n     block grant. Therefore, we strongly support Senator Bob \n     Graham's amendment to\n\n[[Page S8417]]\n\n     strike the language imposing a cumulative penalty of five \n     percent of the block grant per year on states that fail to \n     meet the mandated work requirements. Imposing harsh and \n     excessive penalties will only make it more difficult for \n     states to succeed. State legislators are committed to welfare \n     reform and have proved it through passage of numerous laws \n     reforming their welfare systems. We have asked the federal \n     government for flexibility to change the current system and \n     hope for legislation to empower the states.\n       The Congress has challenged us to go even further, yet the \n     current bill leaves no room for adjustment, even if a state \n     experiences a recession, high unemployment or natural \n     disaster. Despite our best effort, there may be states who \n     cannot meet the work requirements. To add compounding \n     financial penalties will severely restrict state efforts even \n     further--just at the moment when they could use assistance \n     from their federal partner.\n\n  Mr. President, the letter from the National Conference of State \nLegislatures points out a fundamental difference between the sanction \nthat we had previously proposed, and which stays in this bill, and that \nwhich was added in the Finance Committee. The previous sanction made it \nin the discretion of the Secretary of HHS as to whether to levy such a \npenalty, and at what level to do it up to 5 percent. So the Secretary \ncould take into consideration--maybe the reason the State of Vermont \nfailed to meet its work requirement was because they had an unexpected \nnatural disaster in Vermont, as we did in Florida with Hurricane \nAndrew, or maybe they had an unusual economic recession and more people \nwere unable to find work, and therefore they could not meet the work \nrequirements for those persons who are coming off welfare. The \ncumulative language gives no such discretion to the Secretary to take \nthose kinds of real-world conditions into account.\n  A third reason for offering this amendment is the reason that was the \nbasis of discussion earlier today by my colleague, Senator Bumpers, and \nmyself on Friday. That is, we start this process from a very \ninequitable allocation of funds among the 50 States. The reason it is \nso inequitable is because we are basically using the status quo which \nwas based on a State's financial ability and political willingness to \nput up substantial amounts of money for welfare and then draw down an \nequivalent amount of Federal matching funds. That formula has resulted \nin disparities of in the range of 4 and 5 to 1 between high-benefit \nStates and low-benefit States in the amount of funds that they have per \npoor person.\n  For instance, in the State of Arkansas, for every person in their \nState who has an income below the poverty level, they would get $397 of \nFederal support. In the State of New York, under this legislation, in \nthe year 2000 they would get $1,961 for every person below 100 percent \nof poverty level. When you compound that large inequity in the amount \nof Federal funds per State with a common requirement that all States \nhave to meet in terms of getting a proportion of their welfare \npopulation off welfare and into work, you have enormous differences in \nthe impact of this legislation.\n  Mr. President, I am going to truncate my remarks because I know there \nare some amendments that have to be offered before 2 o'clock. But let \nme, just for my colleagues, point out that the State of Arkansas, in \nthe year 2000, has estimated it will have to spend 49 percent of the \nfunds which today go to provide economic support to pay for everything \nfrom school supplies to clothing to diapers to utilities, 49 percent of \nthose funds will have to go to meet the work requirements, that is, to \npay for the job training, to pay for the child care, to pay for the \nother support services such as job placement. That is in the State of \nArkansas.\n  In my State, which is a middle State in terms of benefits, 36 percent \nof our funds would have to go to meet those requirements, whereas in \nNew York State, only 14 percent of their combined State-Federal funds \nwould be required in order to pay for exactly the same work assistance \nthat Arkansas and Florida would have to provide, thus leaving a very \ninequitable amount left over for the fundamental economic support that \nthis program for 60 years has been providing to indigent families in \nAmerica.\n  So, for those three reasons--lack of clarity as to what this \namendment is supposed to mean; second, the strong opposition of the \nStates because of its lack of flexibility; and, third, the inequitable \napplication of this cumulative sanction amendment--I offer this \namendment. At the appropriate time, I will urge its support.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n                                            National Conference of\n\n\n                                           State Legislatures,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, July 22, 1996.\n       Dear Senator: The National Conference of State Legislatures \n     (NCSL) is committed to continuing our work with the Congress \n     to enact comprehensive, bipartisan welfare reform legislation \n     this year. As you consider amendments to S. 1956, state \n     legislators offer the following positions for your \n     consideration. We strongly believe that the final welfare \n     reform bill must: (1) provide maximum flexibility to state \n     and local governments; (2) preserve existing state authority \n     and avoid preemption; (3) fund federally-mandated activities; \n     (4) avoid cost-shifts to states; and (5) ensure that states \n     have adequate implementation time for programs fully- or \n     partially-devolved to the states.\n       State legislators want welfare reform to succeed. In order \n     to succeed, we need adequate implementation time to craft \n     comprehensive welfare reform that best fits the needs in our \n     individual states. In S. 1956, both the work participation \n     rate requirements and penalties begin in the first year of \n     the block grant. Therefore, we strongly support Senator Bob \n     Graham's amendment to strike the language imposing a \n     cumulative penalty of five percent of the block grant per \n     year on states that fail to meet the mandated work \n     requirements. Imposing harsh and excessive penalties will \n     only make it more difficult for states to succeed. State \n     legislators are committed to welfare reform and have proved \n     it through passage of numerous laws reforming their welfare \n     systems. We have asked the federal government for flexibility \n     to change the current system and hope for legislation to \n     empower the states.\n       The Congress has challenged us to go even further, yet the \n     current bill leaves no room for adjustment, even if a state \n     experiences a recession, high employment or natural disaster. \n     Despite our best effort, there may be states who cannot meet \n     the work requirements. To add compounding financial penalties \n     will severely restrict state efforts even further--just at \n     the moment when they could use assistance from their federal \n     partner. Senator Graham's amendment also allows the Secretary \n     to reduce state penalties after assessing the individual \n     experience of that state. We have always opposed cookie-\n     cutter welfare reform. The current bill does not allow for \n     the diversity of state experience in reforming the system and \n     the timing of state legislative sessions to enact the laws \n     necessary to change the system.\n       The Congressional Budget Office has estimated that there is \n     a $13 billion shortfall in the cash assistance block grant to \n     meet the work requirements. NCSL has always supported deficit \n     reduction and we understand the limitation on available funds \n     for work. However, the current bill as drafted penalizes us \n     as we charter unknown waters to create a new system to \n     retrain state workers, create employment slots, verify work \n     slots and, of course, be successful at moving recipients to \n     work. A distinction is not made for states who have made a \n     good faith effort but fail to meet the requirements for \n     reasons beyond their control. We are very concerned that this \n     will hamper state creativity, innovation and excellence. \n     State legislators urge you to support Senator Graham's \n     amendment.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   Carl Tubbesing,\n     Deputy Executive Director.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n\n                              National Government Association,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, June 26, 1996.\n     Senate Finance Committee,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC\n       Dear Finance Committee Member: The nation's Governors \n     appreciate that S. 1795, as introduced, incorporated many of \n     the National Governors' Association's (NGA) recommendations \n     on welfare reform. NGA hopes that Congress will continue to \n     look to the Governor's bipartisan efforts on a welfare reform \n     policy and build on the lessons learned through a decade of \n     state experimentation in welfare reform.\n       However, upon initial review of the Chairman's mark, NGA \n     believes that many of the changes contained in the mark are \n     contradictory to the NGA bipartisan agreement. The mark \n     includes unreasonable modifications to the work requirement, \n     and additional administrative burdens, restrictions and \n     penalties that are unacceptable. Governors believe these \n     changes in the Chairman's mark greatly restrict state \n     flexibility and will result in increased, unfunded costs for \n     states, while at the same time undermining states ability to \n     implement effective welfare reform programs. These changes \n     threaten the ability of Governors to provide any support for \n     the revised welfare package, and may, in fact, result in \n     Governors opposing the bill.\n       As you mark up the welfare provisions of S. 1795, the \n     Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Act of 1996, NGA \n     strongly urges you to consider the recommendations contained \n     in the welfare reform policy adopted unanimously by the \n     nation's Governors in February. Governors believe that these \n     changes are needed to create a welfare\n\n[[Page S8418]]\n\n     reform measure that will foster independence and promote \n     responsibility, provide adequate support for families that \n     are engaged in work, and accord states the flexibility and \n     resources they need to transform welfare into a transitional \n     program leading to work.\n       Below is a partial list of amendments that may be offered \n     during the committee markup and revisions included in the \n     Chairman's mark that are either opposed or supported by NGA. \n     This list is not meant to be exhaustive, and there may be \n     other amendments or revisions of interest or concern to \n     Governors that are not on this list. In the NGA welfare \n     reform policy, the Governors did not take a position on the \n     provisions related to benefits for immigrants, and NGA will \n     not be making recommendations on amendments in these areas. \n     As you markup S. 1795, NGA urges you to consider the \n     following recommendations based on the policy statement of \n     the nation's Governors on welfare reform.\n       The Governors urge to support the following amendments:\n       Support the amendment to permit states to count toward the \n     work participation rate calculation those individuals who \n     have left welfare for work for the first six months that they \n     are in the workforce (Breaux). The Governors believe states \n     should receive credit in the participation rate for \n     successfully moving people off of welfare and into \n     employment, thereby meeting one of the primary goals of \n     welfare reform. This will also provide states with an \n     incentive to expand their job retention efforts.\n       Support the amendment that applies the time limit only to \n     cash assistance (Breaux). S. 1795 sets a sixty-month lifetime \n     limit on any federally funded assistance under the block \n     grant. This would prohibit states from using the block grant \n     for important work supports such as transportation or job \n     retention counseling after the five-year limit. Consistent \n     with the NGA welfare reform policy, NGA urges you to support \n     the Breaux amendment that would apply the time limit only to \n     cash assistance.\n       Support the amendment to restore funding for the Social \n     Services Block Grant (Rockefeller). This amendment would \n     limit the cut in the Social Services Block Grant (SSBG) to 10 \n     percent rather than 20 percent. States use a significant \n     portion of their SSBG funds for child care for low-income \n     families. Thus, the additional cut currently contained in S. \n     1795 negates much of the increase in child care funding \n     provided under the bill.\n       Support technical improvements to the contingency fund \n     (Breaux). Access to additional matching funds is critical to \n     states during periods of economic recession. NGA supports two \n     amendments proposed by Senator Breaux. One clarifies the \n     language relating to maintenance of effort in the contingency \n     fund and another modifies the fund so states that access the \n     contingency fund during only part of the year are not \n     penalized with a less advantageous match rate.\n       Support the amendment to extend the 75 percent enhanced \n     match rate through fiscal 1997 for statewide automated child \n     welfare information systems (SACWIS), (Chafee, Rockefeller). \n     Although not specifically addressed in the NGA policy, this \n     extension is important for many states that are trying to \n     meet systems requirements that will strengthen their child \n     welfare and child protection efforts.\n       Governors urge you to oppose amendments or revisions to the \n     Chairman's mark that would limit state flexibility, create \n     unreasonable work requirements, impose new mandates, or \n     encroach on the ability of each state to direct resources and \n     design a welfare reform program to meet its unique needs.\n       In the area of work, Governors strongly oppose any efforts \n     to increase penalties, increase work participation rates, \n     further restrict what activities count toward the work \n     participation rate, or change the hours of work required. The \n     Governor's policy included specific recommendations in these \n     areas, many of which were subsequently incorporated into S. \n     1795, as introduced. The recommendations reflect a careful \n     balancing of the goals of welfare reform, the availability of \n     resources, and the recognition that economic and demographic \n     circumstances differ among states. Imposing any additional \n     limitations or modifications to the work requirement would \n     limit state flexibility.\n       The Governors urge you to oppose the following amendments \n     or revisions in the area of work:\n       Oppose the revision in the Chairman's mark to increase the \n     number of hours of work required per week to thirty-five \n     hours in future years. NGA's recommendation that the work \n     requirement be set at twenty-five hours was incorporated into \n     S. 1795. Many states will set higher hourly requirements, but \n     this flexibility will enable states to design programs that \n     are consistent with local labor market opportunities and the \n     availability of child care.\n       Oppose the revision in the Chairman's mark to decrease to \n     four weeks the number of weeks that job search can count as \n     work. NGA supports the twelve weeks of job search contained \n     in S. 1795, as introduced. Job search has proven to be \n     effective when an individual first enters a program and also \n     after the completion of individual work components, such as \n     workfare or community service. A reduction to four weeks \n     would limit state flexibility to use this cost-effective \n     strategy to move recipients into work.\n       Oppose the revision in the Chairman's mark to increase the \n     work participation rates. NGA opposes any increase in the \n     work participation rates above the original S. 1795 \n     requirements. Many training and education activities that are \n     currently counted under JOBS will not count toward the new \n     work requirements. Consequently, states will face the \n     challenge of transforming their current JOBS program into a \n     program that emphasizes quick movement into the labor force. \n     An increase in the work rates will result in increased costs \n     to states for child care and work programs.\n       Oppose the revision in the Chairman's mark to increase \n     penalties for failure to meet the work participation \n     requirements. The proposed amendment to increase the penalty \n     by 5 percent for each consecutive failure to meet the work \n     rate is unduly harsh, particularly given the stringent nature \n     of the work requirements. Ironically, the loss of block grant \n     funds due to penalties will make it even more difficult for a \n     state to meet the work requirements.\n       Oppose the amendment requiring states to count exempt \n     families in the work participation rate calculation (Gramm). \n     This amendment would retain the state option to exempt \n     families with children below age one from the work \n     requirements but add the requirement that such families count \n     in the denominator for purposes of determining the work \n     participation rate. This penalizes states that grant the \n     exemption, effectively eliminating this option. The exemption \n     in S. 1795 is an acknowledgment that child care costs for \n     infants are very high and that there often is a shortage of \n     infant care.\n       Oppose the amendment to increase work hours by ten hours a \n     week for families receiving subsidized child care (Gramm). \n     This amendment would greatly increase child care costs as \n     well as impose a higher work requirement on families with \n     younger children, because families with other children--\n     particularly teenagers--are less likely to need subsidized \n     child care assistance.\n       Oppose the revision in the Chairman's mark to exempt \n     families with children below age eleven. S. 1795, as \n     introduced, prohibits states from sanctioning families with \n     children below age six for failure to participate in work if \n     failure to participate was because of a lack of child care. \n     This revision would raise the age to eleven. NGA is concerned \n     that this revision effectively penalizes states because they \n     still would be required to count these individuals in the \n     denominator of the work participation rate.\n       The Governors urge you to oppose the following amendments \n     or revisions in the chairman's mark in these additional \n     areas:\n       Oppose the revision in the Chairman's mark to increase the \n     maintenance-of-effort requirement above the 75 percent in the \n     cash assistance block grant or further narrow the definition \n     of what counts toward maintenance-of-effort.\n       Oppose the revisions in the Chairman's mark that increase \n     state plan requirements and include additional state \n     penalties.\n       Oppose the amendment to limit hardship exemption to 15 \n     percent (Gramm). NGA policy supports the current provision in \n     S. 1795, as introduced, that allows states to exempt up to 20 \n     percent of their caseload from the five-year lifetime limit \n     on benefits.\n       Oppose the amendment to mandate that states provide in-kind \n     vouchers to families after a state or federal time limit on \n     benefits is triggered (Breaux, Mosely-Braun). NGA believes \n     that states should have the option to provide non-cash forms \n     of assistance after the time limit, but they should not be \n     mandated to do so.\n       Oppose the provision in the Chairman's mark to restrict the \n     transferability of funds out of the cash assistance block \n     grant to the child care block grant only. The governors \n     believe that it is appropriate to allow a transfer of funds \n     into the foster care program or the Social Services Block \n     Grant.\n       Oppose a family cap mandate in the Chairman's mark. NGA \n     supports a family cap as an option, rather than a mandate, to \n     prohibit benefits to additional children born or conceived \n     while the parent is on welfare.\n       Governors urge you to consider the above recommendations.\n           Sincerely,\n                                             Raymond C. Scheppach,\n     Executive Director.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n\n                             National Association of Counties,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, July 12, 1996.\n       Dear Member of Congress: You may be voting soon on the \n     Welfare and Medicaid reform bill (H.R. 3507/S. 1795). The \n     National Association of Counties (NACo) is encouraged that \n     there were improvements to the welfare section of the bill, \n     including: increased funds for child care; maintaining \n     current law for foster care adoption assistance maintenance \n     and administration payments; and no funding cap for food \n     stamps nor a block grant for child nutrition. However, there \n     are not enough improvements to warrant our support. In some \n     respects, particularly the work requirements, the bill has \n     become even more burdensome. NACo particularly opposes the \n     following welfare provisions:\n       1. The bill ends the entitlement of Aid to Families with \n     Dependent Children, thereby dismantling the safety net for \n     children and their families.\n       2. The eligibility restriction for legal immigrants goes \n     too far. The most objectionable provisions include denying \n     Supplemental Security Income and Food Stamps, particularly to \n     older immigrants. In fact, by changing the implementation \n     date for these provisions, the bill has become more onerous. \n     NACo is also very concerned about the effect of the deeming \n     requirements particularly with regard to Medicaid and \n     children in need of protective services.\n\n[[Page S8419]]\n\n       3. The participation requirements have become even more \n     unrealistic. NACo particularly opposes the increased work \n     participation rates and increased penalties, the changes in \n     the hours of work required, and the new restrictions on the \n     activities that may count toward the participation rates.\n       As the level of government closest to the people, local \n     elected officials understand the importance of reforming the \n     welfare system. While NACo is glad that the bill does contain \n     language that requires some consultation with local officials \n     we prefer the stronger language that is contained in the \n     bipartisan welfare reform bill (H.R. 3266).\n       NACo also continues to oppose the Medicaid provisions. By \n     capping the fiscal responsibility of the federal government \n     and reducing the state match for the majority of the states, \n     the bill could potentially shift billions of dollars to \n     counties with responsibility for the uninsured. Allowing the \n     states to determine the amount, duration and scope of \n     services even for the remaining populations which would still \n     be guaranteed coverage, will mean that counties will be \n     ultimately responsible for services not covered adequately by \n     the states. While we support the increased use of managed \n     care and additional state and local flexibility in operating \n     the Medicaid program, we do not support the repeal of \n     Medicare as envisioned in the current legislation.\n       As it is currently written, the Medicaid and Welfare Reform \n     bill could potentially shift costs and liabilities, create \n     new unfunded mandates upon local governments, and penalize \n     low income families. Such a bill, in combination with federal \n     cuts and increased demands for services, will leave local \n     governments with two options: cut other essential services, \n     such as law enforcement, or raise revenues. NACo therefore \n     urges you to vote against H.R. 3507/S. 1795.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 Douglas R. Bovin,\n                                                        President.\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority manager is recognized.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I take 1 minute from our side to \nindicate our objection to the amendment. In the bill on page 273, there \nis a section that reads: ``Reasonable Cause for Exception.--'' And it \napplies to the areas the Senator from Florida is referring to.\n  It says:\n\n       The Secretary may not impose a penalty on a State under \n     subsection (a) with respect to a requirement if the Secretary \n     determines that the State has reasonable cause for failing to \n     comply with the requirement.\n\n  Then it has two exceptions to this, and neither of the two are \nmatters covered by the concern of the Senator. So I believe there is \nflexibility, and for those State legislators and staff up here who \nlooked at it, I suggest they read that provision.\n  In addition, there is a whole process following that provision for \nhow a State would determine that they had reasonable cause.\n  Having said that, I am going to yield back any time I have on the \namendment.\n\n\n         ELECTRONIC BENEFIT TRANSFER SYSTEMS AND WELFARE REFORM\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, a number of consumer groups have \nexpressed concern about a provision in the pending welfare reform bill \nthat exempts users of electronic benefit transfer systems [EBT's] users \nfrom the protections of the Electronic Benefit Transfer Act.\n  EBT's are a useful reform to modernize the distribution of welfare \nbenefits. They are comparable to automated teller machines. They offer \na convenient way for welfare recipients to use a card to withdraw their \ncash benefits from a bank machine or pay for food at a grocery store. \nAlthough a few States may now have in place such a program, it is \nlikely to become much more common in the years ahead. Massachusetts is \nin the process of implementing such a system for its 80,000 welfare \nrecipients.\n  If the final welfare reform bill includes the exemption from consumer \nprotections, EBT users will not have the same basic safeguards against \nbenefit losses caused by computer error, merchant fraud, or theft that \nother credit card holders now have. Clearly, it is unfair to deny \nreasonable safeguards to welfare beneficiaries.\n  I understand that a realistic compromise is being developed to \nprotect EBT users from benefit losses while ensuring that States are \nnot exposed to unmanageable costs. I am hopeful that any welfare reform \nbill enacted into law will contain such protections, and I urge all \nSenators to support them.\n\n\n                   teen pregnancy and statutory rape\n\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I am pleased that the Senate has made \nprogress in two areas critical to reforming welfare--teen pregnancy and \nstatutory rape. Both sides of the aisle have worked together to bring \nabout this progress, and I am left hopeful that we can infuse future \nnegotiations on other welfare issues with this bipartisan spirit of \ncooperation.\n  Mindful of the American public's demand for legislative progress this \nyear, I joined other colleagues in sponsoring initiatives that would \nnot only benefit children, but also reduce welfare spending. Budget \nspecialists and community leaders emphasized the necessity of dealing \nwith two underlying welfare problems--teen pregnancy and statutory \nrape. In examining these problems, we answered two necessary questions: \nFirst, who is on welfare? and Second, how did they get there?\n  Teenage out-of-wedlock pregnancy is a primary cause of long-term \nwelfare dependency. Currently, 53 percent of AFDC funds go to \nhouseholds begun by teenage births. Senator Conrad and I proposed an \namendment to last year's Senate bill which requires teen mothers to \nlive at home or in adult-supervised settings, establishes national \ngoals regarding education strategies and reduction of pregnancy rates, \nand rewards States who meet these goals with a cash bonus.\n  The Senate included these provisions in the bill in front of us and \nstrengthened the Federal role in combating this problem. However, teen \npregnancy prevention is a battle that must be fought at the local \nlevel, as troubled teens demand direct individual attention and \ninvestment. By accepting my amendment which compels States to devote 1 \npercent of their Social Security block grant--$23.8 million--to \nprevention services, the Senate has spurred them to assume this \nresponsibility. We are succeeding in aiding President Clinton as he \nendeavors, in his own words, ``to get all the leaders of all sectors of \nour society involved in this fight.''\n  The Federal Government, too, recently assumed more responsibility in \naccepting my amendment which targets the crime of statutory rape, a \ndirect and indirect cause of teen pregnancy. The great majority of \nbabies born to teen mothers are fathered by adult men, and the partners \nof the youngest mothers under the age of 14 are on average 10 to 15 \nyears older than them. This Senate is sending sexual predators an \nunequivocally stern message--that we choose abstinence for children, \nand that we will not tolerate those who take advantage of a child's \ninability to form and articulate a decision about her body. Previously, \nwe concurred that it is the Sense of the Senate that States should \naggressively enforce statutory rape laws. Now, we are taking additional \nsteps. The amendment requires the Justice Department to pay strict \nattention to this crime. They are to research the link between \nstatutory rape and teen pregnancy, as well as those predatory men who \ncommit these crimes repeatedly. They will also educate State and local \nlaw enforcement officials to effectively prevent and prosecute \nstatutory rape.\n  Again, we include the States in this fight. This amendment compels \nthe States to create and expand criminal law enforcement, public \neducation, and counseling initiatives and to restructure teen pregnancy \nprevention programs to include men. Finally, States must certify to the \nFederal Government that they are engaged in such activities to stop \nstatutory rape.\n  By focusing on the problems of teen pregnancy and statutory rape \nthrough these amendments, we are economizing our future welfare \nexpenditures and improving the lives of poor children. The reality of \nmothers sacrificing educational opportunities to give birth to \nfatherless babies and live in poverty is not a choice. It is partly a \nresult of the greater problems these amendments address.\n  I appreciate, and the American public will appreciate our bipartisan \nunity in demanding responsibility from fathers. They must own up to \ntheir paternity, pay child support, and set a good example for their \nchildren by working in private sector or community service jobs. A \ncertain group of men must refrain from sexually preying upon young \ngirls and dispossessing them of their fundamental right to make sexual, \neducational, and career choices.\n\n[[Page S8420]]\n\n  Problems remain in this bill. I appeal to my colleagues to work \ntogether so that we can present not just a few amendments, not just one \nimprovement, but an entire bill to the American citizenry that truly \nreforms the current system.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I know Senator Exon needs some time.\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, I thank the chairman for his consideration. \nI will say, there are several matters that I must, as manager of the \nbill on this side, have very limited and short debate on, things I need \nto enter. I might be able to do that between now and 2 o'clock, but if \nnot, in order to protect the interests of those I represent, I ask \nunanimous consent that the 2 o'clock hour be extended by 10 minutes, to \n10 minutes past 2, if necessary, to accommodate the Senator from \nNebraska to carry out the duties that I must address.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Reserving the right to object, I do not know what it is \nyou want to do. Do you want to offer amendments on behalf of Senators?\n  Mr. EXON. Yes, these are things I have to do as a manager of the bill \non this side, including points of order requests.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Let me make one further request. Are any of those \namendments for Senators who did not come today to offer their \namendments? How many are those?\n  Mr. EXON. There are three amendments that were on the list that the \nSenators have not come to formally offer today, and I intend to perform \nthat duty for them.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. So long as we clearly understand, this does not flow to \nSenators who come in here at 5 minutes after, this applies to you.\n  Mr. EXON. I amend the request, if I might. I ask unanimous consent \nthat, if necessary to discharge the duties assigned to the Democratic \nleader of the Budget Committee, that the additional 10 minutes be \nassigned to this Senator and this Senator only.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I have no objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. EXON. I thank my friend for his usual good cooperation. There are \ntwo amendments I will offer. They have been cleared on both sides. I \nthink we can dispose of them quickly.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4953\n\n  (Purpose: To allow States to choose the most appropriate agency to \n   assist abused and neglected children, by enabling them to choose \n proprietary as well as non-profit or government agencies to care for \n  children in foster care, as provided in report number 104-430 (the \n  conference report to H.R. 4 as passed during the 1st session of the \n104th Congress), and S. 1795, as introduced in the Senate during the 2d \n    session of the 104th Congress, and before the Finance Committee \n                 Chairman's modifications to such bill)\n\n  Mr. EXON.

Mr. President, I am deeply concerned that for the first \ntime in history, Congress will ban legal immigrants from most \nassistance programs. Banning legal immigrants from these programs will \nalso deny their children the assistance they need to become healthy, \nproductive members of society. The amendment I am offering will exempt \nchildren from these bans.\n  The Republican bill permanently bans legal immigrants from SSI and \nfood stamps. It bans them for 5 years from Medicaid, AFDC and other \nprograms. It also gives States the option of going even farther, and \npermanently banning them from Medicaid, AFDC, and social service block \ngrants.\n  Several preliminary points are important to understand about this \nissue.\n  First, this bill is a ban. Banning is not the same as deeming. In \ndeeming, we look to the sponsor for payment before the Government pays. \nUnder banning, the sponsor is not involved. The ban covers legal \nimmigrants, with or without sponsors.\n  Second, we are not talking about illegal immigrants. This bill bans \nlegal immigrants from safety net programs. These are individuals and \nfamilies who come here legally, play by the rules, and pay their taxes. \nThey are future citizens trying to make it in this country. Yet this \nbill would repay them by banning them from assistance if they fall on \nhard times.\n  Third, the ban's application to children makes no sense. Many \nchildren will be affected and harmed, but many others will not. It \ndepends entirely on where they were born. Children born in the United \nStates are U.S. citizens and will be eligible for assistance, even if \ntheir parents are legal immigrants. But children born overseas will be \ncaught by the ban. So children in the same\n\n[[Page S8422]]\n\nfamily will be treated differently, depending on where they were born. \nThis is unfair.\n  Fourth, the children involved often live in the families of U.S. \ncitizens. A typical case involves a citizen who has married and brought \nhis new spouse and the spouse's child to America. Surely, they deserve \nhelp.\n  AFDC, SSI, food stamps and Medicaid are programs which are especially \ncritical to children's health and development. Banning legal immigrant \nchildren from these programs puts their well-being at stake, and it \nputs the public at risk, too.\n  Legal immigrants can get sick like everyone else. Their families can \nfall on hard times. They can become disabled. Banning them from basic \nassistance programs means that when their sponsors can't provide \nsupport, immigrants won't get the help they need. Their medical \nconditions will go untreated and their disabilities will worsen.\n  These children are future citizens. Like all other children in \nAmerica, they need and deserve to be assured of good health and good \nnutrition. If the Federal Government abandons them, communities will \nsuffer.\n  When immigrant children get sick, they infect other children. By \nbanning them from Medicaid, we are also banning them from school-based \ncare under the Early and Periodic Screening, Detection, and Treatment \nProgram, which provides basic health care to school-age children. It is \npart of Medicaid in most states.\n  Under this bill, legal immigrant children will be banned from going \nto the school nurse when they feel sick in school. If they try to see \nthe nurse, the nurse cannot treat them because they are immigrants. \nThey have no private insurance and they are banned from Medicaid. If \nthe illness gets worse, their parents may take them to the local \nemergency room--a very expensive alternative and not likely to be \npursued unless the illness seems severe.\n  Suppose a child has tuberculosis. In the time it took for the illness \nto worsen enough to be covered by emergency Medicaid, many classmates \nhave been exposed--all because no early help was available.\n  In addition to Medicaid, the Republican bill bans legal immigrant \nchildren from SSI, which provided assistance to the blind and disabled. \nNine thousand legal immigrant children are blind or disabled. They have \nsome of the most complex and life-threatening needs of all. As a \npractical matter, such cases often involve tragic accidents, where \nexpensive long-term care is needed to deal with debilitating \nconditions. If SSI is not available, children literally will die.\n  The Republican bill also bans legal immigrant children from food \nstamps, which could sentence them to a lifetime of health problems due \nto poor nutrition. Parents will have to turn to soup kitchens and food \npantries just to feed their children. Yet, soup kitchens are already \nstretched beyond their capacity. Almost all soup kitchens limit the \nnumber of times a person can come to the kitchen for food. Some \nkitchens allow one visit a month. Others allow only three to six visits \na year. If we cut off food stamps, many legal immigrant children will \nhave nowhere to turn for food.\n  Nutrition is vital to the development of a child. Immigrant children \nare no exception. Without access to food stamps, some immigrant \nchildren will suffer a lifetime of anemia, stunted growth, and even \npermanent brain damage.\n  Finally, it makes no sense to ban legal immigrants from AFDC \npayments. AFDC allows mothers to place their children in child care, so \nthat the parent can work or go to school. Without AFDC, parents will \nhave to stay home to take care of their children. This bill is not \nwelfare reform for legal immigrants. It will push families further into \npoverty, with no chance of escape.\n  For all of these reasons, I urge the Senate to adopt this amendment, \nand reject this harsh and extreme attack on immigrant children.\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, I yield back time on the amendment.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Pursuant to section 310(d)(2), I raise a point of order \nagainst the pending Kennedy amendment on behalf of the Finance \nCommittee.\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, I move to waive the point of order and ask \nfor the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4956\n\n (Purpose: To allow a 2-year implementation period under the Medicaid \nprogram for implementation of the attribution of sponsor's income, the \n                   5-year ban, and other provisions)\n\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, on behalf of the Senator from Massachusetts, \nSenator Kennedy, I send another amendment to the desk and ask for its \nimmediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Nebraska [Mr. Exon], for Mr. Kennedy, \n     proposes an amendment numbered 4956.\n\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The text of the amendment is printed in today's Record under \n``Amendments Submitted.'')\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, the changes in Medicaid for legal \nimmigrants in this legislation will have a major impact on health care \ninstitutions and on the public health.\n  Virtually all of the Nation's hospitals have called on Congress to \ndelay implementation of these changes for at least 2 years because of \ntheir far-reaching consequences. Those who have urged such a transition \ninclude:\n  The American Association of Eye and Ear Hospitals,\n  The American Hospital Association,\n  The Association of American Medical Colleges,\n  The American Osteopathic Healthcare Association,\n  The Federation of American Health Systems, InterHealth,\n  The National Association of Children's Hospitals,\n  The National Association of Community Health Centers,\n  The National Association of Psychiatric Health Systems,\n  The National Association of Public Hospitals,\n  Premier, Inc.; and\n  The Catholic Health Association of the United States.\n  My amendment responds to their concern by postponing the \nimplementation of the Medicaid changes on immigrants for 2 years, in \norder to enable State and local governments and hospitals and clinics \nto make the major adjustments required under this bill.\n  Even with this transition, these changes will hurt the health care \nsystem and harm the public health. It is bad public health policy to \ndeny Medicaid to legal immigrants. Last April, the National Conference \nof State Legislatures, the National Association of Counties, and the \nNational League of Cities wrote to Congress stating:\n\n       Without this program eligibility, many legal immigrants \n     will not have access to health care. Legal immigrants will be \n     forced to turn to State indigent health care programs, public \n     hospitals, and emergency rooms for assistance or avoid \n     treatment altogether. This will in turn endanger the public \n     health and increase the cost of providing health care to \n     everyone.\n\n  But if these changes are to take place, then we should at least give \nhealth providers the time they need to adjust.\n  Although the bill continues emergency Medicaid for legal immigrants, \nthey would be banned from regular Medicaid for 5 years. After that, \nthey can qualify for Medicaid only if their sponsor's income and \nresources are too low to assist them. But States can decide to ban \nlegal immigrants permanently from Medicaid.\n  Hospitals fear that if Medicaid is restricted, the loss of funds will \nrequire them to reduce services for everyone--citizens and non-citizens \nalike. Especially vulnerable are the most costly services, such as \ntrauma care, burn treatment, and neonatal intensive care.\n  This crisis in funding will particularly affect hospitals that serve \ncommunities with large numbers of immigrants. In the case of public \nhospitals, most patients have Medicaid coverage. Today, at Cambridge \nCity Hospital in Massachusetts, 48 percent of the patients are \nimmigrants. That means the hospital could lose half of its Medicaid \nfunding under this bill.\n\n[[Page S8423]]\n\n  For Los Angeles County Hospital, the figure is 60 percent. For \nJackson Memorial Hospital in Miami, 40 percent. For San Francisco \nGeneral Hospital, 30 percent. For Harris County Hospital in Houston, 30 \npercent.\n  The sudden loss of Medicaid income when the immigrant population is \ndenied coverage may well jeopardize the quality of health care in the \nentire community those hospitals serve.\n  In addition, those without health coverage through insurance or \nMedicaid are less likely to receive preventive medical care and timely \nimmunization. The result is unnecessarily higher risks of disease in \nthe community as a whole. The care system will try to prevent this \nresult, but it is a gamble that Congress should not impose.\n  At a minimum, the health care system needs time to adjust. Under this \nbill, the Medicaid changes go into effect immediately for future \nimmigrants. States may choose to deny Medicaid starting on January 1, \n1997. That's unfair and unrealistic. Hospitals and State and local \ngovernments need time to adjust. Community health centers need to find \nways to expand, as Medicaid resources dry up for hospital care. State \nlegislatures will need to adopt new laws and adjust spending to \ncompensate for the loss of Medicaid.\n  These complicated changes cannot occur overnight, especially in \nCalifornia, Texas, Florida, New York, New Jersey, Massachusetts, \nPennsylvania, Illinois, and other States with large immigrant \npopulations..\n  These changes should not go into effect at all. But if they do, I \nurge my colleagues at least to hear the pleas and heed the plight of \nthe hospitals. They need more time and they deserve it.\n  I urge the adoption of this amendment.\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, I yield back time on the amendment.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, pursuant to appropriate sections of the \nBudget Act, I raise a point of order against the pending Kennedy \namendment on behalf of the Finance Committee.\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, at this point, I move to waive all points of \norder against the pending amendment. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4957\n\n (Purpose: To modify remittance requirement from 5 to 7 days for child \n                     support enforcement payments)\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, since the hour of 2 is arriving and we \nhave agreed to extra time just for Senator Exon, I send an amendment to \nthe desk in behalf of Senator Nickles. It was on the list. It modifies \nthe requirement for remittance, making it 7 days instead of 5 for child \nsupport payments. I send that amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from New Mexico [Mr. Domenici], for Mr. \n     Nickles, proposes an amendment numbered 4957.\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 438, line 15, strike ``5'' and insert ``7''.\n\n  Mr. EXON. We have no objection to this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the amendment is agreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 4957) was agreed to.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote by which \nthe amendment was agreed to.\n  Mr. EXON. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, in 1986, the Congress enacted the so-called \n``Byrd rule,'' named for our esteemed colleague, Senator Byrd, now \nincorporated into the Congressional Budget Act of 1974 as section 313. \nAlthough it may seem arcane to those not immediately involved in the \nbudget process, the Byrd rule has become a very important tool to curb \nprovisions in the reconciliation bill that are extraneous to the \npurpose of deficit reduction. It helped close Pandora's box of \nreconciliation abuse, of which Senator Byrd so eloquently warned more \nthan 10 years ago.\n  The Byrd rule provides six definitions of what constitute extraneous \nmatter, but the term generally applies to provisions unrelated to the \nreconciliation deficit reduction goals.\n  For example, a provision in reconciliation could be challenged by a \nSenator if it produces no changes in revenue or spending or if such \nchanges are merely incidental. Sixty votes are necessary to waive a \npoint of order raised under the Byrd rule. Last year's reconciliation \nbill contained numerous Byrd rule violations. This year's bill is also \nbrimming with violations. I will shortly present a full list to the \nChair and raise a point of order, but I want to highlight two of them.\n  First, there is a provision that deletes a requirement that the \nSecretary of Agriculture promulgate rules so that school lunch \ncontracts comply with the applicable meat inspection laws.\n  Second, there is a provision that strikes the requirement that \npositive efforts shall be made by service institutions to use small \nbusiness and minority-owned businesses as sources of supplies and \nservices for these school lunch programs.\n  Mr. President, once again, these are simply other add-ons that we \nshould look to. Once again, this is not an all-inclusive list, but it \ngives the Senate a flavor of the violations that I will shortly raise.\n  With that, Mr. President, I send a list of provisions to the desk \nthat I have referenced, and pursuant to section 313(d) of the \nCongressional Budget Act, I raise a point of order that these \nprovisions violate section 313(b)(1) of that act.\n  The list follows:\n\n                                        EXTRANEOUS PROVISIONS IN S. 1956                                        \n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n              Section                         Subject                 Violation                Rationale        \n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nSection 1206(h)...................

The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, might I inquire of the distinguished \nSenator, before I lodge my waiver with this, have we finished the work \nthat you had alluded to that you had to do?\n  Mr. EXON. We have one other matter. It is simply something to offer \ninto the Record, a letter from the President on the matter that I think \nyou will have no objection to. Other than that, I have nothing further, \nafter the motion that I have just made.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I assume when we dispose of that, and you get your \ninsertion, we are finished and have complied with the order about \ncompleting the work on this bill?\n  Mr. EXON. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, since I have not had time nor has our \nstaff had time to review the list of subject matters for Byrd rule \npoints of order--and I want to state in a very specific way that I \ntotally agree with the statements of the Senator from Nebraska as to \nwhy we have a Byrd rule. It is not totally perfect, but it is much \nbetter than having this law and this reconciliation without that kind \nof limitation. Nonetheless, we have not had a chance to review them. So \nwhat I would like to do--and I am going to do this now; I want to \nexplain it to Senator Exon--I am going to move to waive each one and \nthen we will reserve until tomorrow and consult with all of you on \nwhich ones we may indeed seek a vote, if any.\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, the request from the Senator is entirely in \norder. I had anticipated that they would have some time to look at the \nlist because we have just completed it ourselves and sent it to the \ndesk. Therefore, I have no objection to the request just made and would \nagree to it.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I move to waive the Budget Act with \nrespect to each individual point of order that has just been sent to \nthe desk and lodged by the minority.\n  I might inform the Senate that, without votes on the points of order \nif we elect to seek waiver, there are 22 stacked votes now in the event \nwe vote on everything that we have heretofore cleared. The starting \ntime, according to the previous order, unless changed, will be 9:30 \na.m. tomorrow morning.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. EXON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a letter \nstating the administration's position on the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n         Executive Office of the President, Office of Management \n           and Budget,\n                                    Washington, DC, July 18, 1996.\n     Hon. J. James Exon,\n     Committee on the Budget, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Exon: I am writing to transmit the \n     Administration's views on S. 1956, the ``Personal \n     Responsibility, Work Opportunity, and Medicaid Restructuring \n     Act of 1996.''\n       We understand that the Senate Republican leadership plans \n     to move to strike the Medicaid provisions of this \n     reconciliation legislation--leaving a welfare-only bill for \n     Senate floor consideration.\n       We are pleased with this decision to separate welfare \n     reform from provisions to repeal Medicaid's guarantee of \n     health care for the elderly, the poor, pregnant women, and \n     people with disabilities. We hope that removing this ``poison \n     pill'' from welfare reform is a breakthrough that shows that \n     the Republican leadership seriously wants to pass bipartisan \n     welfare reform this year.\n       Enacting bipartisan welfare reform reflecting the \n     principles of work, family, and responsibility is among the \n     Administration's highest priorities. For the past three-and-\n     a-half years, the President has demonstrated his commitment \n     to enacting real welfare reform by working with Congress to \n     enact legislation that moves people from welfare to work, \n     encourages responsibility, and protects children. The \n     Administration sent Congress a stand-alone welfare bill that \n     requires welfare recipients to work, imposes strict time \n     limits on welfare, toughens child support enforcement, is \n     fair to children, and is consistent with the President's \n     commitment to balance the budget.\n       The Administration is pleased that the bill makes many of \n     the important improvements to H.R. 4 that we recommended--\n     improvements also included in the bipartisan National \n     Governors' Association (NGA) and Breaux-Chafee proposals. The \n     Senate bill improves upon the bill that the House is now \n     considering. We urge the Senate to build on these \n     improvements, and to continue the bipartisan spirit displayed \n     in last year's debate on welfare reform. At the same time, \n     however, the Administration is deeply concerned about certain \n     provisions of S. 1956 that would adversely affect benefits \n     for Food Stamp households and legal immigrants, as well as \n     the need for strong State accountability and flexibility. \n     And, the bill would still raise taxes on millions of workers \n     by cutting the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC).\n\n\n                   improvements contained in s. 1956\n\n       We appreciate the Finance and Agriculture Committees' \n     efforts to strengthen provisions central to work-based \n     reform, such as child care, and to provide additional \n     protections for children and families. In rejecting H.R. 4, \n     the President singled out a number of provisions that were \n     tough on children and did too little to move people from \n     welfare to work. S. 1956 includes important changes to these \n     provisions that move the legislation closer to the \n     President's vision of true welfare reform. We are \n     particularly pleased with the following improvements:\n       Child Care. As the President has insisted throughout the \n     welfare reform debate, child care is essential to move people \n     from welfare to work. The bill reflects a better \n     understanding of the child care resources that States will \n     need to implement welfare reform, adding $4 billion for child \n     care above the level in H.R. 4. The bill also recognizes that \n     parents of school-age children need child care in order to \n     work.\n       Food Stamps. The bill removes the annual spending cap on \n     Food Stamps, preserving the program's ability to expand \n     during periods of economic recession and help families when \n     they are most in need. We are concerned, however, with other \n     Food Stamp proposals, as discussed below.\n       Maintenance of Effort. The Administration strongly supports \n     the Finance Committee's changes to State maintenance of \n     effort\n\n[[Page S8425]]\n\n     (MOE) and transfer provisions and believes these are critical \n     elements of bipartisan welfare reform. The Committee removed \n     the objectionable transfer authority to the Title XX Social \n     Services Block Grant and other programs and would allow \n     transfers to child care only. In addition, the Committee \n     restored the 80 percent MOE level in last year's Senate bill \n     and tightened the definition of what counts toward this \n     requirement.\n       Work Performance Bonus. We commend the Committee for giving \n     States an incentive to move people from welfare to work by \n     providing $1 billion in work program performance bonuses by \n     2003. This provision was an important element of last year's \n     Senate bill and the Administration's bill, and will help \n     change the culture of the welfare office.\n       Contingency Fund. The bill adopts the NGA recommendation to \n     double the Contingency Fund to $2 billion, and add a more \n     responsive trigger based on the Food Stamp caseload. Below, \n     the Administration recommends further steps that Congress \n     should take to strengthen this provision.\n       Equal Protection. The Committee includes provisions that \n     would require States to establish objective criteria for \n     delivery of benefits and to ensure equitable treatment. We \n     are pleased that the Committee also incorporates appropriate \n     State accountability measures.\n       Hardship Exemption. We commend the Finance Committee for \n     following the NGA recommendation and restoring last year's \n     Senate provisions allowing States to exempt up to 20 percent \n     of hardship cases that reach the five-year limit.\n       Transitional Medicaid. We are pleased that the Finance \n     Committee has taken steps to ensure the continuation of \n     Medicaid coverage for some of those who are transitioning \n     from welfare to work. We are concerned, however, that States \n     could deny this transitional Medicaid to many who would lose \n     cash benefits for various reasons. In addition, we still have \n     concerned with Medicaid coverage for those on cash \n     assistance, as noted below.\n       Worker Displacement. We are pleased that the bill \n     incorporates provisions against worker displacement, \n     including protections from partial displacement as well as \n     avenues for displaced employees to seek redress.\n       Child Nutrition. The bill now includes many provisions \n     proposed by the Administration, and no longer includes H.R. \n     4's provisions for a child nutrition block-grant \n     demonstration. In addition, the bill exempts the child \n     nutrition program from burdensome administrative provisions \n     related to its alien provisions. We believe that the Senate \n     could further improve the bill by including the \n     Administration's proposed 8 percent commodity floor.\n       Child Protection. We commend the Finance Committee for \n     preserving the Title IV-E foster care and adoption assistance \n     programs (including related Medicaid coverage), and other \n     family support and child abuse prevention efforts.\n       Supplemental Security Income (SSI). The bill removes the \n     proposed two-tiered benefit system for disabled children \n     receiving SSI, and retains full cash benefits for all \n     eligible children.\n       We remain pleased that Congress has decided to include \n     central elements of the President's approach--time limits, \n     work requirements, the toughest possible child support \n     enforcement, and the requirement that minor mothers live at \n     home as a condition of assistance--in this legislation.\n\n\n                       key concerns with s. 1956\n\n       The Administration, however, remains deeply concerned that \n     S. 1956 still lacks other important provisions that have \n     earned bipartisan endorsement.\n       Size of the cuts. The welfare provisions incorporate most \n     of the cuts in the vetoed bill--about $60 billion over six \n     years (including the EITC and related savings in Medicaid). \n     These cuts far exceed those proposed by the NGA or the \n     Administration. Cuts in Food Stamps and benefits to legal \n     immigrants are particularly deep. The President's Budget \n     demonstrates that cuts of this size are not necessary to \n     achieve real welfare reform, nor are they needed to balance \n     the budget.\n       Food Stamps. The Administration strongly opposed the \n     inclusion of a Food Stamp grant option, which could seriously \n     undermine the Federal nature of the program, jeopardizing the \n     nutrition and health of millions of children, working \n     families, and the elderly, and eliminating the program's \n     ability to respond to economic changes. The Administration \n     also is concerned that the bill makes deep cuts in the Food \n     Stamp program, including a cut in benefits to households with \n     high shelter costs that disproportionately affects families \n     with children, and a four-month time limit on childless \n     adults who are willing to work but are not offered a work \n     slot.\n       Legal Immigrants. The bill retains the excessively harsh \n     and uncompromising immigration provisions of last year's \n     vetoed bill. While we support the strengthening of \n     requirements on the sponsors of legal immigrants applying for \n     SSI, Food Stamps, and Aid to Families with Dependent Children \n     (AFDC), the bill bans SSI and Food Stamps for virtually all \n     legal immigrants, and imposes a five-year ban on most other \n     Federal programs, including non-emergency Medicaid, for new \n     legal immigrants. These bans would even cover legal \n     immigrants who become disabled after entering the country, \n     families with children, and current recipients. The bill \n     would deny benefits to 300,000 immigrant children and would \n     affect many more children whose parents are denied \n     assistance. The proposal unfairly shifts costs to States with \n     high numbers of legal immigrants. In addition, the bill \n     requires most Federal, State, and local benefits programs to \n     verify recipients' citizenship or alien status. These \n     mandates would create extremely difficult and costly \n     administrative burdens for State, local, and non-profit \n     service providers, as well as barriers to participation for \n     citizens. Also, the Administration urges that Senate not go \n     in the harsh direction that the House Rules Committee did \n     yesterday in reporting a provision that would broaden the ban \n     on current immigrants from receiving Medicaid coverage.\n       Medical Assistance Guarantee. The Administration opposes \n     provisions that do not guarantee continued Medicaid \n     eligibility when States change AFDC rules. We are concerned \n     that families who lose cash assistance for various reasons, \n     such as reaching the five-year limit or having additional \n     children while they are receiving assistance, could lose \n     their Medicaid eligibility and be unable to receive the \n     health care services that they need. In addition, State \n     flexibility to change these AFDC rules could adversely affect \n     Medicaid eligibility determinations, including eligibility \n     for poverty-related pregnant women and children.\n       Protection in Economic Downturn. Although the Contingency \n     Fund is twice what it was in the vetoed bill, it still does \n     not allow for further expansions during poor economic \n     conditions and periods of increased need. We are also \n     concerned about provisions that reduce the match rate on \n     contingency funds for States that access the fund for \n     periods of under a year.\n       Resources for Work. S. 1956 would not provide the resources \n     States need to move recipients into work. The bill increases \n     the work mandates on States above the levels in H.R. 4 while \n     providing no additional resources for States to meet these \n     more stringent rates. Based on CBO estimates, the Senate bill \n     would provide $12 billion less over six years than is \n     required to meet the bill's work requirements and maintain \n     the current level of cash assistance to poor families. CBO \n     notes that ``most States would be unlikely to satisfy this \n     requirement.'' Moreover, the Senate bill would lead to a $2.4 \n     billion shortfall in child care resources (assuming States \n     maintain their current level of cash assistance benefits, \n     continue current law Transitional and At-Risk child care \n     levels, and do not transfer amounts from the cash block grant \n     to child care).\n       Vouchers. The bill actually reduces State flexibility by \n     prohibiting States from using block grant funds to provide \n     vouchers to children whose parents reach the time limit. H.R. \n     4 contained no such prohibition, and the NGA opposes it. We \n     strongly urge the adoption of voucher language, similar to \n     that in the Administration's bill and Breaux-Chafee, that \n     protects children.\n       Child Care Health and Safety Protections. The bill repeals \n     current child care health and safety protections and cuts \n     set-aside funds to the States to improve the safety and \n     quality care. We strongly urge the Senate to restore these \n     basic health and safety protections, which were enacted with \n     strong bipartisan support in 1990 and maintained in last \n     year's Senate bill and are essential to the safety and well-\n     being of millions of young children.\n       Family Caps. The Senate bill reverts back to the opt-out \n     provision on family caps which would restrict State \n     flexibility in this area. The Administration, as well as the \n     NGA, seeks complete State flexibility to set family cap \n     policy.\n       EITC. The Administration opposes the provision in S. 1956 \n     that raises taxes on over four million low-income adult \n     workers by ending inflation adjustments for working \n     households without dependent children, and thereby \n     substantially cutting the real value of their tax credit over \n     time. Raising taxes on these workers is wrong. In addition, \n     the budget resolution instructs the revenue committees to cut \n     up to $18.5 billion more from the EITC. Thus, EITC cuts could \n     total over $20 billion. Such large tax increases on working \n     families are particularly ill-conceived when considered in \n     the context of real welfare reform--that is, encouraging work \n     and making work pay.\n       We strongly support the bipartisan welfare reform \n     initiatives of moderate Republicans and Democrats in both the \n     House and Senate. The Breaux-Chafee proposal addresses many \n     of our concerns, and it would strengthen State accountability \n     efforts, welfare to work measures, and protections for \n     children. It provides a foundation on which the Senate should \n     build in order to provide more State flexibility; incentives \n     for AFDC recipients to move from welfare to work; more \n     parental responsibility; and protections for children. It is \n     a good, strong proposal that would end welfare as we know it. \n     Breaux-Chafee provides the much needed opportunity for a real \n     bipartisan compromise, and it should be the basis for a quick \n     agreement between the parties.\n       The President stands ready to work with Congress to address \n     the outstanding concerns so we can enact a strong, bipartisan \n     welfare reform bill to replace the current system with one \n     that demands responsibility, strengthens families, protects \n     children, and gives States broad flexibility and the needed \n     resources to get the job done.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                     Jacob J. Lew,\n                                                  Acting Director.\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, parliamentary inquiry.

Section 747(e) of the Federal Agriculture \n     Improvement and Reform Act of 1996 is amended by inserting, \n     ``effective October 1, 1996'' following ``The Secretary shall \n     make grants'' in Section 747(e)(2).\n       Sec. 737. Labeling of Raw Poultry Products.--\n       (a) In general.--Notwithstanding any other provision of \n     law, none of the funds appropriated or otherwise made \n     available by this Act may be used to implement or enforce the \n     final rule related to the labeling of raw poultry products \n     promulgated by the Food Safety and Inspection Service on \n     August 25, 1995 (60 Fed. Reg. 44395), and the final rule \n     shall not be effective during fiscal year 1997.\n       (b) Final rule.--Not later than 90 days after the date of \n     enactment of this Act, the Secretary of Agriculture shall \n     issue a revised final rule related to the labeling of raw \n     poultry products that--\n       (1) maintains the standard that the term ``fresh'' may be \n     used only for raw poultry products the internal core \n     temperature of which has not fallen below 26 deg. Fahrenheit;\n       (2) deletes the requirement that poultry products the \n     internal core temperature of which has ever been less than \n     26 deg. Fahrenheit, but more than 0 deg. Fahrenheit, be \n     labeled as ``hard chilled'' or ``previously hard chilled'', \n     except that--\n       (A) the products shall be prohibited under the rule from \n     being labeled as ``fresh'' but shall not be required to bear \n     any specific alternative labeling; and\n       (B) nothing in this section shall be interpreted as \n     modifying the requirements for labeling of all poultry \n     products the internal core temperature of which has ever \n     fallen to 0 deg. Fahrenheit as ``frozen'';\n       (3) provides for a tolerance from the 26 deg. Fahrenheit \n     standard established by the rule of--\n       (A) 1 deg. Fahrenheit for poultry products within an \n     official processing establishment;\n       (B) 2 deg. Fahrenheit for poultry products in commerce;\n       (4) exempts from temperature testing wings, tenders, \n     hearts, livers, gizzards, necks, and products that undergo \n     special processing, such as sliced poultry products; and\n       (5) in all other terms and conditions (including the period \n     of time permitted for implementation) is substantively \n     identical to the rule referred to in subsection (a).\n       (c) Revised labeling standards.--Not later than 60 days \n     after the issuance of a revised final rule under subsection \n     (b), the Secretary of Agriculture, acting through the \n     Administrator of the Food Safety and Inspection Service, \n     shall issue a compliance directive for the enforcement of the \n     revised labeling standards established by the rule, including \n     standards for--\n       (1) temperature testing that are based on measurements at \n     the center of the deepest muscle; and\n       (2) sampling methods that ensure that the average of \n     individual temperatures within poultry product lots of each \n     specific product type (such as whole birds, whole muscle leg \n     products, and whole muscle breast products) meet the \n     standards.\n       (d) Severability.--If any provision of this section or the \n     application thereof to any person or circumstance is held \n     invalid, the validity of the remainder of this section and of \n     the application of the provision to any other persons or \n     circumstances shall not be affected.\n       Sec. 738. Section 7 of the Food Stamp Act of 1977 (7 U.S.C. \n     2016) is amended by adding at the end the following:\n       ``(j) Electronic Benefit Transfers.--\n       ``(1) Definition of electronic benefit transfer system.--In \n     this subsection, the term `electronic benefit transfer \n     system' means a system under which a governmental entity \n     distributes benefits pursuant to this Act by establishing an \n     account that may be accessed electronically by a recipient of \n     the benefits or payments.\n       ``(2) Applicable law.--Disclosures, protections, \n     responsibilities, and remedies established by the Federal \n     Reserve Board under section 904 of the Electronic Fund \n     Transfer Act (15 U.S.C. 1692b) shall not apply to benefits \n     under this Act delivered through any electronic benefit \n     transfer system.\n       ``(3) Replacement of benefits.--Regulations issued by the \n     Secretary regarding the replacement of benefits and liability \n     for replacement of benefits under an electronic benefit \n     transfer system shall be similar to the regulations in effect \n     for a paper-based food stamp issuance system.''.\n\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I am pleased to present to the Senate \ntoday the bill making appropriations for the Department of Agriculture \nand related agencies for the fiscal year 1997. This bill provides \nfunding for all of the activities under the jurisdiction of the \nDepartment of Agriculture, except for the U.S. Forest Service. It also \nfunds the activities of the Food and Drug Administration, the Commodity \nFutures Trading Commission, and pays for expenses and payments of the \nFarm Credit System.\n  This bill recommends total new budget authority of $54.3 billion. \nThis is $9 billion less than the 1996 enacted level for these programs \nand these activities. It is $4 billion less than the President's fiscal \nyear 1997 budget request. It is $1.2 billion more than the level \nrecommended by the House.\n  Over 76 percent of the total to be spent under this bill will go for \nfunding of the Nation's domestic food assistance programs. That \nrepresents $40.5 billion of this $54.3 billion bill. This is up from 63 \npercent of the total funding in the bill in 1996. These programs \ninclude food stamps, the national school lunch and elderly feeding \nprograms, and the supplemental feeding program for women, infants and \nchildren.\n  The bill recommends total discretionary spending of $13.118 billion \nin budget authority and $13.409 billion in outlays for fiscal year \n1997. These amounts are consistent with the allocation the subcommittee \nhas received under the Budget Act.\n  Senators should also be aware these allocations are approximately \n$510 million in budget authority and $440 million in outlays less than \nwhat would be required under a freeze. The suggestion this year, for \nthose who are following the budget debate, was that spending under the \ndiscretionary programs of the Federal Government ought to be held level \nwith last year's spending. That was the goal, that was the objective. \nThis bill meets that target and then some. There is actually a \nreduction in spending from the freeze level in this bill as compared \nwith last year's or the current fiscal year's budget and appropriations \nlevels.\n  We do have some parts of this bill where spending is increased. Among \nthe discretionary spending increases recommended are an additional \n$12.8 million to continue the efforts of the Food Safety and Inspection \nService to ensure the safety of our Nation's food supply. The level \nrecommended for the Food Safety and Inspection Service is adequate to \nmaintain the current inspection system and to provide the needed \ninvestments required to implement the new hazard analysis and critical \ncontrol point meat and poultry inspection system. We are hopeful that \nby bringing this new system online we can take advantage of new \ntechnologies, new scientific advances, in the detection of those \ncontaminants in the food supply that we would not be able to detect \notherwise, and we will help ensure that we are doing everything that \npossibly can be done to safeguard the food supply and the consumers of \nfood in America from harm and ill health.\n  In order to implement the system, the bill provides funding to fill \nall inspector vacancies, funding to train inspectors in the new \ninspection system, and funding for the annualization of fiscal year \n1996 pay raises and anticipated 1997 pay raises. This demonstrates the \nhigh priority this committee places on the safety of our Nation's meat \nand poultry and our commitment to ensure that American consumers \ncontinue to have the safest food in the world.\n  Another area of emphasis in this bill is agriculture research. The \nbill provides $1.1 billion for funding of agriculture research. This is \napproximately $7.3 million below the level requested by the \nadministration, but it is $25 million above the House-recommended \nlevel. Included in this amount is $52 million for food safety research. \nThe committee has provided the full increase of $7.5 million requested \nfor food safety research.\n  For extension activities, the bill recommends $431 million, which is \n$3.3 million above the fiscal year 1996 level. The Smith-Lever and \nHatch Act formula funding are continued at 1996 levels. The increase \nrecommended for extension activities will provide first-time funding \nfor institutional capacity\n\n[[Page S8436]]\n\ngrants and extension work at the 29 tribally controlled colleges, or \n1994 Institutions.\n  Farm credit programs are funded by the bill, which provides $3.1 \nbillion in loan levels for the coming fiscal year. This is an increase \nof $65 million over the House-recommended level.\n  The bill also recognizes that efficiencies can be gained through the \nconsolidation of programs to improve their efficiency in terms of \nadministrative costs and paperwork and the like. So the bill \nconsolidates funding for 14 rural development grant and loan programs \ninto a rural community investment program. It is divided into three \nsubprograms: housing, business cooperative assistance, and rural \nutilities assistance. The 1996 appropriations act created the first of \nthese consolidations for rural utilities. The funding levels provided \nfor all three of the programs were equal to the comparable levels \nrequested in the budget.\n  On an aggregate basis, the funding levels in the bill represent an \nincrease of $231 million more than the House-passed bill. The bill \nfunds, as I mentioned before, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission \nand the Food and Drug Administration. We are trying to provide levels \nof funding that will enable these two agencies to do the job they are \nrequired to do by law and that will enable them to discharge their \nresponsibilities under the law.\n  The bill also carries a provision to ensure the continuation of WIC \nProgram funding and Food Stamp Act funding, as well. The bill includes \na provision to amend the Food Stamp Act, to exclude electronic benefit \ntransfer systems for the delivery of food stamp benefits from the \nFederal Reserve Board's ``Regulation E.''\n  There are other provisions of the bill that seek to deal with \nchallenges in the food service area, and we hope Senators will find \nthat we have demonstrated a sensitivity to the needs of those who \ncannot adequately provide for their own nutrition needs and need \nGovernment help to do it. But we also reflect in this bill changes and \nreforms that have been made by law to try to ensure that there is a \nsense of personal responsibility for one to take care of himself and \nhis family, and that also is reflected in this legislation.\n  Senators may remember that, last year, when this bill was on the \nfloor, there was a big debate over a regulation being proposed by the \nadministration--the Food Safety and Inspection Service, specifically--\ndealing with when poultry products could be labeled as ``fresh'' or \n``frozen.'' Well, I am happy to report to the Senate that a compromise \nhas been reached among those who were directly interested in the debate \nlast year, so that the definition of the term ``fresh,'' as used in \nlabeling of raw poultry products, is reflected and included in this \nlegislation. We hope that resolves the issue. Of course, the \nadministration still has differences of opinion about it, and those may \nbe heard at some point in the debate.\n  We think this is a responsible way of resolving that issue. There are \nother provisions related to legislative changes the House recommended \nthat we deleted. The House rewrote some provisions that were included \nin the farm bill, and we did not go along with those House provisions. \nSo Senators will notice that we do not provide a cap on the price of \nraw sugarcane, for example. We do not approve a provision relating to \nplanting requirements under the farm bill that would be required to \nmeet eligibility standards for a market transition payment. We revised \nthat to make it consistent with the language of the law, the farm bill \nthat was passed by both Houses and signed by the President. So we do \nnot try to go in and rewrite the farm bill in this bill. We urge \nSenators not to try to do that with amendments.\n  Only 24 percent of the total funding recommended by this bill is \ndiscretionary. These have been difficult challenges for the committee \nto resolve, trying to determine how to allocate scarce funds that are \nmade available to this subcommittee under the budget resolution. We \nhope Senators will agree that we have undertaken this and presented a \nbill that is done in a fair way, so that those essential activities in \nthe Department of Agriculture that are authorized and required by law \nare funded. But we have tried to be responsible, and we hope Senators \nagree that we have. These are recommendations that we make to the \nSenate, which we hope will be approved.\n  Let me say that this bill could not have been written without the \nexcellent cooperation and dedicated and intelligent assistance of the \ndistinguished Senator from Arkansas, the ranking Democrat on the \nsubcommittee. He has served as chairman of this subcommittee in the \npast, and it has been a pleasure to work with him and the members of \nhis staff in the development of this bill.\n  We had hearings all through the earlier parts of this year. We heard \nfrom all of the agencies and departments, whose budgets were reviewed \nby our subcommittee very carefully. We have considered the suggestions \nof others outside of the Congress, who have opinions to be expressed on \nthese subjects. So we have tried to consider all of the relevant \nevidence and facts that ought to be considered before presenting this \nbill to the Senate. We hope the Senate will approve it, and we \nrecommend that it be adopted.\n  We know that Senators may have amendments. If they do have \namendments, we will be glad to debate them. Let me repeat the \nsuggestion of the majority leader when he was asking consent to go to \nthis bill today. We hope to complete action on this bill today. That \nmeans that all amendments that are going to be offered should be \noffered today and debated today. We will reserve any votes on those \namendments, and any vote on final passage, until tomorrow. We \nappreciate the cooperation of Senators that will enable us to \naccomplish that goal.\n  Mr. BUMPERS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, parliamentary inquiry. Has there been a \nunanimous-consent agreement entered that we would start back-to-back \nvotes on welfare bill amendments in the morning?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. At 9 o'clock, yes, that is correct.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Does the consent agreement continue on what we will do \nafter those votes and final passage on the welfare bill?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair is reminded that it is at 9:30 that \nwe vote and 9 o'clock that we meet. After getting rid of the list of \nvotes, we will resume consideration of the agriculture bill.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. That is the reason I was asking. I hope we do not have \nto resume. I hope we can finish the bill this afternoon and this \nevening.\n  I am pleased to join my very able colleague, Senator Cochran, in \nbringing to the Senate floor the fiscal year 1997 appropriations bill \nfor Agriculture, rural development, the Food and Drug Administration, \nand related agencies. This bill, reported by the Senate Committee on \nAppropriations, provides $54.276 billion in total obligational \nauthority for the coming year. That is $1.224 billion more than the \nHouse provided and $4 billion below the President's request. It is \nwithin the subcommittee's 602(b) allocation. This bill is nearly $10 \nbillion below the amount under which we are operating this year, 1996. \nThat will be $10 billion less than in 1997. The subcommittee's \ndiscretionary allocation has again been reduced this year from $13.31 \nbillion in budget authority for 1996 to $12.102 billion for 1997. That \nis a reduction in discretionary spending of $529 million dollars. \nUnfortunately, we have received an increase of $300 million-plus in our \nallocation, which gets us a little closer to last year's level, but \nstill the bottom line is that we have less to spend again this year.\n  Mr. President, in all of my years on this subcommittee, the \nAgriculture Subcommittee, this year has been the most difficult. That \ncauses me to, again, congratulate Senator Cochran for his leadership in \nworking through these very difficult problems and crafting a bill to \nmeets the expectations of most Senators. It meets the hard-pressed \nneeds of rural America and, also, America's dependence on a safe supply \nof food and drugs.\n\n  There are still plenty of unmet needs in rural America, but, given \nthe constraints under which we are operating, this is an excellent \nbill.\n  One item in the bill is very important to all of us, and it is \ngreatly improved over last year's funding level.\n\n[[Page S8437]]\n\n The Water and Sewer Program in the U.S. Department of Agriculture, in \nmy opinion, is just about the very best investment we make. It improves \nthe quality of life for all people when they have pure water and sewer \nsystems that are safe. Last year, these programs were severely \nunderfunded. But this year, Senator Cochran has been able to provide an \nincrease that almost brings us to our budget request. That is an \nadmirable achievement.\n  Let me digress to point out that people who travel around the world \nfind that there are very few countries that you can visit where you can \nturn on the tap water and feel relatively safe in drinking it. As a \nmatter of fact, I can only think of one or two right now where you can \ndo that. The people who live in and near Washington, DC, have just \nrecently found that not only happens in other countries but it happens \nright here in the United States in some of the major metropolitan \nareas.\n  In other areas, this bill provides level funding for the WIC \nProgram--women, infants and children. Historically, this program has \nwitnessed annual increases in funding that have actually exceeded the \ncaseload. So we have been carrying over money in the WIC Program. This \nprogram has accumulated, and it has reduced the pressure on us to \ncontinue increasing the amount of money every year. Even considering \nthe general budget constraints, we are within reach of full funding for \nWIC, a goal which I believe is shared by every Member of the U.S. \nSenate.\n  As WIC administrators work this coming year to provide nutritional \nassistance to women, infants, and children, I hope that next year we \nwill finally reach the goal of full funding and the more important goal \nof full participation.\n  Last year, Congress passed and sent to the President a new farm bill. \nThis year, when the bill was considered by the House, a number of \nprovisions were included to change some of the underlying philosophy of \nthe farm bill. I did not vote for the farm bill. I did not like it, and \nI still do not like it. But that is beside the point at this stage of \nthe game.\n  Contracts that farmers all across America thought would guarantee \nthem payments for 7 years were being reduced by the House \nAppropriations Committee even before the farmers got their first \npayment. Regardless of my views of the so-called freedom to farm \npayments, we need to remember that farmers are now in the middle of \ntheir growing season. Their investments are on the line, and they \ndeserve to know what to expect and that the rules are not going to be \nchanged in the middle of the game. The chairman has already alluded to \nthe fact that he hopes Senators will not try to redebate that bill. In \nthe bill before us, we have taken great pains not to amend the basic \nrationale for last year's farm bill.\n  There is one major concern I have that deserves mention. When the \nPresident's budget was presented to this subcommittee, loan authority \nassumptions were much too high to be met considering the small subsidy \nprovided. Mr. President, let me just explain that.\n  Every loan program is scored by OMB and the Congressional Budget \nOffice as to how much money you have to assume you are going to lose. \nIf you are going to loan $1 million, you have to put some amount in \nthere for what the banks would call reserve for loan losses. That is \ncalled the subsidy rate. The subsidy rate in this bill as provided by \nthe administration, in my opinion, is much too small to fund the \nauthority of loans set out in all of these different Federal programs. \nIn my opinion, we are not going to be able to loan as much unless we \nhave a supplemental appropriation sometime next spring to raise that \nsubsidy level.\n  We are including in the managers' package an amendment that will \nallow the Secretary to transfer excess WIC funds to meet the needs of \nloan programs such as those tied to water and sewer programs in rural \nhousing.\n  Mr. President, before anybody thinks that is cruel and taking money \nfrom women, infants and children to fund a subsidy rate for water and \nsewer programs, bear in mind that this is money not used by WIC. This \nis similar to an amendment I offered last year that provided an \nadditional $36 million in the Water and Sewer Program with no \ndetrimental effect to the WIC participation. This amendment will help, \nbut it probably will not provide enough additional budget authority to \nachieve full program levels. That is the reason I mention additions to \nthe subsidy in some supplemental appropriations next spring.\n  I hope in future budget submissions, the administration will take \ngreater care to make sure that rising interest rates or other economic \nconditions do not provide falsely optimistic assumptions of what may be \nthe reality on the first day of the following fiscal year.\n  I also want to mention an issue which I raised during subcommittee \nconsideration of this bill related to an FDA proposal to require \ncertain labeling requirements for prescription drugs--the so-called \nmed-guide rule.\n  Let me digress just a moment to say that--this is a little personal--\nI recently had an illness. I went to the drugstore to get four \ndifferent medications. I have studiously avoided taking aspirin all of \nmy life. I hate medicine. I do not like to take it. But in this case it \nwas required. For the first time in my life, the pharmacist with each \nof the four prescriptions handed me a rather detailed description of \nthe medicine--what it was designed to do, contraindications to look \nfor, any reactions that you might have. I read it very carefully. It is \nthe first time I had ever gotten anything like that.\n  As it turned out, I was allergic to one of the drugs, which caused me \nto have a fever, a rash, and I had to quit taking it. But the \ninformational sheet that the pharmacist gave me had pointed out that \nthat very thing might happen.\n  That is good information. It is the information that the \npharmaceutical-buying public is entitled to. I understand--and I agree \nwith the concerns of the Food and Drug Administration--that consumers \nneed to be provided with this information.\n  As I pointed out, some pharmacies are already doing it on a voluntary \nbasis. Of course, they are getting their information from the \npharmaceutical manufacturers of those drugs. But all pharmacies are not \ndoing this now. In some cases, the information is not totally accurate \nor complete.\n  So in the full committee, I offered report language that will help \nrelieve some of the concerns that Commissioner Kessler expressed to me \nabout the statutory language contained in this bill. I understand the \nHouse has similar language but of a nature more to the liking of the \ncommission. In my report, language is designed to give FDA assurances \nthat the information to be provided to consumers will be appropriately \ncrafted and higher rates of participation by pharmacies will be \nobtained.\n  Mr. President, that concludes my remarks. Again, I want to \ncongratulate my good friend and colleague, Senator Cochran and his able \nstaff in drafting the bill now before us.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. COCHRAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator from \nArkansas for his kind remarks and again repeat my expression of \nappreciation for his hard work and his good assistance in the \npreparation of this legislation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the committee amendments \nwhich are at the desk to H.R. 3603 be considered and agreed to en bloc; \nthat no points of order be waived thereon; that the measure, as \namended, be considered as original text for the purpose of further \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  The committee amendments were agreed to.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I know that some Senators are considering \namendments. One Senator has just come to the floor--Senator Gregg of \nNew Hampshire--who wanted to give the Senate notice that he intended to \noffer an amendment on a subject. Maybe, if he can tell us when he wants \nto do that, we can reach some agreement as to the time. I know there \nare a couple of other Senators who have asked that they be permitted to \noffer amendments early in the consideration of the bill. Senator McCain \nis one, and there may be others.\n  So we are ready to accept the suggestions of Senators for changes in \nthe bill. I would be happy to yield to my\n\n[[Page S8438]]\n\nfriend from New Hampshire if he would like to respond to my inquiry.\n  Mr. GREGG. I am happy to respond to the inquiry of the Senator from \nMississippi. I would like to offer my amendment when it is convenient \nto the Senator from Mississippi.\n  I ask if he would ask unanimous consent that no second-degree \namendments be offered to my amendment.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I can say that we have gotten notice--and \nmaybe the Senator from Arkansas has heard of this--from one Senator on \nthis side of the aisle who asked that no unanimous-consent agreement be \nmade on any amendment relating to the issue of sugar.\n  Having heard that--I do not know whether the Senator has heard that \nor not--I do not know of any objection to any agreements on this side \nof the aisle on that subject. We have not heard of any. My thought \nwould be if the Senator has an amendment to simply go ahead and offer \nit and let us see what happens. If Senators want to debate it, they can \ncome and debate it.\n  Mr. GREGG. In a prior discussion with the Senator from Mississippi, \nit was my understanding this was going to be subject to a time \nlimitation of 40 minutes.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. I have no objection to that. I have heard there may be \nan objection on the other side of the aisle. There is no objection on \nthis side.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. There will be an objection, I say to the Senator from \nMississippi, on this side.\n  Mr. GREGG. I guess if I had known that I would not have foreclosed my \nrights on other parts of this bill.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. The Senator has all of his rights. There are no rights \nof his whatsoever that have been extinguished in any way or diminished \nin any way.\n  Mr. GREGG. There are a few that have been extinguished and \ndiminished, I point out to the Senator, in allowing----\n  Mr. COCHRAN. The committee amendments to be adopted.\n  Mr. GREGG. The committee amendments to go forward. It was my \nunderstanding that committee amendments would go forward because I was \ngoing to be given a specific time and time limit. That does not appear \nto be the case. I find that to be inconsistent with the understanding I \nhad. And I guess I just have to accept the fact things happen that way \naround here.\n  Mr. BUMPERS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. If I may just in a general colloquy with the \ndistinguished chairman of the committee say that normally when we have \na series of amendments to be offered on a bill like this, we sort of go \nback and forth between the Democratic side and the Republican side. I \nwould suggest that that is fine if you have the Republicans and \nDemocrats waiting to offer amendments, but that very seldom happens on \nthis bill. And if there are three Republicans and no Democrats in the \nChamber waiting to offer amendments, then I suggest we take them and \nnot sit around waiting for somebody on the other side to come and offer \namendments in order to accommodate a protocol we have used in the past.\n  Would the Senator agree with that?\n  Mr. COCHRAN. I certainly agree with the Senator. We want to complete \naction on all the amendments. The majority leader wanted to have votes \non whatever amendments have to be voted on tomorrow and final passage \ntomorrow. To do that we are going to have to move along because I have \nseen a list of amendments that we have heard may be offered, and there \nare some 20 on that list. So in order to expedite the handling of those \namendments, I agree with the Senator that we should move along. We \nwould like for Senators to come now to the floor and start offering \nthese amendments so we could dispose of them.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. I noticed that the Senator and I each have an amendment \nwhich I think have been agreed to. The Senator has one to provide for \nelectronic warehouse receipts, is that correct? Could we dispose of \nthat one now?\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Senator Pressler was going to offer that. We could offer \nit for him, but if he wants to be here and offer that amendment, we \nwill give him an opportunity to do so.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. All right.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Maybe we will let him know he should come and offer that \namendment if it is convenient at this time for him. We are actually \nwaiting on some language before we could offer that. The Senator could \ngo ahead and proceed to offer his amendment, if he would like.\n  Mr. BUMPERS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, we are scratching through here trying to \nfind this amendment. Until we can find it, let me suggest the absence \nof a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislate bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4958\n\n  (Purpose: To transfer $50,000 from CSREES research and education to \n                         extension activities)\n\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and I ask \nthat it be reported.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Mississippi [Mr. Cochran] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 4958.\n\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 12, line 25, strike ``$46,068,000'' and insert in \n     lieu thereof ``$46,018,000''.\n       On page 14, line 10, strike ``$418,358,000'' and insert in \n     lieu thereof ``$418,308,000''.\n       On page 17, line 8, strike ``$11,331,000'' and insert in \n     lieu thereof ``$11,381,000''.\n       On page 17, line 8, strike ``$431,072,000'' and insert in \n     lieu thereof ``$431,122,000''.\n\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, this amendment would reduce the total \nrecommended for special research grants under research and education \nactivities of the Cooperative State Research, Education, and Extension \nService by $50,000 and increase the amount recommended for Federal \nadministration under extension activities of the service by the same \namount.\n  The amendment would affect only funds recommended for research and \nextension work in Mississippi. It would create a new grant under \nFederal administration for an extension specialist in Mississippi of \n$50,000 to cover an unfunded requirement which was just brought to my \nattention. To offset this additional funding, the amount recommended \nfor aquaculture research in Mississippi would be reduced from the \n$642,000 to $592,000, eliminating the additional funds recommended to \nenable the National Center for Physical Acoustics to provide additional \nsupport to the National Warmwater Aquaculture Center.\n  Mr. President, we have shown this amendment to the other side, and we \nunderstand there is no objection.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, that amendment is acceptable to this \nside. Has it been agreed to?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. It has not been agreed to.\n  Is there further debate? If not, the question is on agreeing to the \namendment.\n  The amendment (No. 4958) was agreed to.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, since it is 3 o'clock, this being the time \nI was advised to bring this amendment to the floor and at that time \nthere was to be a time agreement, which appears now will not occur, I \nthought I would discuss my amendment and point out some of the problems \nwith the sugar program and then make a decision later on as to whether \nor not I will\n\n[[Page S8439]]\n\noffer it in this context or not. But essentially what this amendment \ndeals with is the sugar program.\n  For those who may be following this debate in some other venue other \nthan this floor, because I know everybody who is a Member of the Senate \nunderstands the sugar program, the sugar program is the last vestige of \ngross corporate welfare in the farm community.\n  In the farm bill that was just recently passed, there was a major \ninitiative undertaken to try to put the farm community generally on a \nmore market-oriented approach, although some arguments might claim it \nis even less market oriented. At least it was an attempt to have some \nforces brought to bear on what farmers would plant, how much they would \nplant of a certain commodity which would be something other than a \ndecision made by a Government leader. It would be the marketplace.\n  However, there still exists this sugar program which has just the \nopposite approach toward financing and growing and creating of sugar in \nthis country. The sugar program, as it is basically structured today, \nis a classic, what can best be defined as a Marxist system of \neconomics. Essentially, the Government sets a price for a commodity \nwhich far exceeds what the marketplace would set for that commodity \nwere the marketplace allowed to work in its ordinary fashion, and then \nit requires the consumer to pay that price no matter what the \nconsumer's interest may be. As a result, the growers of that product \ngrow it, make a great deal of money and have no relationship between \nwhat they grow and what the market wants or what they grow and what the \nmarket wishes to pay. It is a classic definition of Marxism.\n  In fact, this program is so outrageous that it costs the American \nconsumer approximately $1.4 billion a year of subsidies to a very small \ncadre of very influential sugar growers. In fact, I think the number I \nsaw was something like less than 70 sugar growers obtaining a huge \npercentage of the income from this program.\n  This subsidy is a function of the fact that it costs about 23 cents a \npound for sugar in the United States, whereas on the world market, it \ncosts about 13 cents a pound for sugar. Think about that for a minute. \nIt is hard to believe that an American product would cost American \nconsumers twice what the world market is. You might expect that in the \nold Soviet Union. You might even expect it in Cuba today. But in the \nUnited States, for somebody to be paying twice the cost of a product \nthat is paid by people in other countries for that same product when \nthat product is fully fungible around the world is incomprehensible. It \njust runs against the whole concept of a market economy, of an American \nsystem, what the United States theoretically stands for in the \ninternational community, what we stood for years against the Soviet \nsystem and what has theoretically, at least, won the debate of \ninternational economics--something called market forces.\n  If a commodity costs 10 cents or 13 cents in Brazil, or let's take a \nmore industrialized state--although Brazil is a very industrialized \nstate--say, Spain, Japan, or France, and that commodity, that item you \nwant to buy costs 13 cents, in this case that is called a pound of \nsugar--if you wanted to make some chocolate chip cookies maybe or a \ncake--and in the United States, it costs 23 cents, you would say, \n``Well, that can't be, that can't be. Why would that be?''\n  Why, in a country that professes a free-market approach to economics, \nan international world free market, would one commodity that we grow in \nthe United States that is grown around the world and moves from country \nto country with fair ease, why would that commodity cost 10 cents more \nin the United States per pound than it does in some other reasonably \nindustrialized nation?\n  The reason is because the influence of the people who make all the \nmoney on this product is so great that they are able to set up a system \nwhich benefits a few at the cost of many. It is pretty much the last \nsurviving system of this type of productivity in our country in the \nfarm program area. There is still some of this, obviously, in the \npeanut area, and to a slighter degree, you can argue in the dairy area, \nbut a much slighter degree. But clearly, sugar is unique in having this \nlevel of perversion of the marketplace for the benefit of a few at the \nexpense of the many, at the rather significant expense, $1.4 billion of \nexpense.\n  You might think that people who would be getting a $1.4 billion extra \nprice for their product beyond what the market usually bears or would \nreasonably bear, would think that they were satisfied, but that is not \nthe case here. I suppose greed feeds on greed, and it is inevitable, if \nyou have proven that you can be really greedy and successful, you can \nget even greedier.\n  So this group of great troughers--by troughers, I mean porker, \ncorporate pork--this group of magnificent troughers--these folks would \nwin just about any contest at any country fair in the pork-producing \ncategory--decided that not only do they have to have a price that is \nalmost twice the world price for the product, which the American \nconsumer has to pay, they do not even want to have to pay off--when \nthey borrow from the Federal Government to produce that product, should \nthey by some unbelievable process lose money, they do not even want to \npay it off.\n  Not only do they want a product that is priced at twice what it is \nworth, but should they actually lose money producing a product that is \npriced twice what it is worth--it is hard to believe they might lose \nmoney--but should they lose money, they do not even want to have to pay \nit off. They have something called the Nonrecourse Loan Program. This \nis almost beyond belief. It is so egregious in its attack on all \nsensibility relative to the marketplace--a nonrecourse loan.\n  If you are a student in the United States and you find yourself going \nto a school that costs you more than you can afford to pay from the \nsummer job you have been working for the last 5 or 6 years, and it \ncosts more than your parents can afford to pay because they cannot \nsimply scrape together enough, because a college education has become \nso expensive, if you are a student and you borrow $1,500, $2,000 from \nthe Federal Government, and you cannot pay it back, does the Federal \nGovernment say, ``That's OK, forget it, you don't have to worry about \nit''? No. The Federal Government requires you to pay it back. We do not \ndo a very good job of collecting it. I admit that. We have to change \nour collection system. But to those people who are honest and sincere--\nthat is the majority of our American students--they have to pay their \nloans back.\n\n  But not the sugar industry. No. The sugar industry, after ripping the \nAmerican public off, after the $1.4 billion a year, after being the \nbiggest porkers in America, they do not even want to pay back their \nloans.\n  If you are a veteran, and you get a VA loan, have served this \ncountry--maybe you have even given blood for this country, maybe you \nare even a wounded veteran--and you get a VA loan, and you find that \nyou cannot pay that loan back, does the American Government say, ``OK. \nOK. Forget it. We won't collect that debt''? No. It does not. It duns \nyour VA benefits, probably garnishes them, takes them as payment even \nthough you may not be able to afford it because you may have other \nexpenses at that time.\n  But do we say that to the sugar producers in this country? No. We do \nnot. To the sugar producers, we say, because they have the power to \ndemand it, ``If you don't want to pay your loans back, tens of millions \nof dollars of loans back, it's OK. Forget it. That's all right. The \nAmerican taxpayers are already paying $1.4 billion to your industry. \nWhy not pay a little bit more through a nonrecourse-loan process?''\n  If you happen to be a homeowner who borrows money through the HUD \nprogram, and you have your first home, and something goes wrong with \nyour family finances, and the Government comes in and takes your home--\nwhich might be similar to a recourse loan--does the Government stop \nthere, to the nonrecourse loan? No. It does not. No. It does not. If \nthere is a debt above the obligation that is available through the \nrepossession of your home, the Government has the right--may not \nexercise it--but it has the right to collect that extra debt from your \nwages.\n  So if you own a home, and through some real tragedy or some \nunfortunate situation your home is taken from you as a result of your \nnot being able to\n\n[[Page S8440]]\n\npay back that debt--and it is a Government loan--the Government has the \nright to sell the home, and to the extent that the price of that home, \nas sold, does not cover the cost of your loan, and you personally are \nliable, you personally, you, John or Mary Jones, working down at the \npizza store or working on an assembly line in Detroit or working at a \ncomputer shop in New Hampshire, you are personally liable for that \nloan.\n  Is the sugar producer--even though his or her company may have \nborrowed millions of dollars--are they liable for that loan? No. They \nare not. No. They are not. It really is hard to believe that that would \nbe the case in this economy, in this structure we would have that sort \nof situation. But that is the way it is. That is the way it is \nstructured, as unbelievable as it may seem.\n  I guess it survives because of the fact that it has what is known as \nlogrolling. ``You scratch my back; I'll scratch your back.'' There are \nenough people producing this product in the country, although many of \nthem are not very large compared to the big guys, that they all feel \nthey have to protect the program and, therefore, everybody helps \neverybody else out. But it is pretty hard to defend this program under \nany sort of--you do not have to look through a magnifying glass to \ndefend this, to look at this program, and see it is an outrage. You can \ntake this glass of water, and put this on top of the program, and you \nwould see that this program is just an unbelievable outrage on the body \npolitic of the American consumer, and $1.4 billion a year in the \nprocess.\n  Nonrecourse loans. Just imagine it. If you are a student you have to \npay your loan back. If you are a home-owner, you have to pay your loan \nback. If you are a veteran who served this country, you have to pay \nyour loan back. Even if it is only $1,000, you have to pay it back.\n  If you are a sugar grower, processor, you do not have to pay it back. \nYou do not have to pay it back. That is after you made the price of the \nproduct twice what it is worth. Pretty outrageous. ``Sweetheart deal'' \nI think is the term that most appropriately comes to mind. Corporate \npork would be an understatement.\n  There is some logic, I suppose, to say that small farmers need to be \nprotected. Maybe you will hear small farmer stories. Well, maybe small \nfarmers do need to be protected. And to the extent we have good stories \nabout small farmers, I suspect there will be some nice sad stories \ntold. But the fact is that the amendment I am going to offer is not \ngoing to affect any small farmers. It is going to affect farmers of \nover $10 million in sales. And that is not a small farm. This is not a \nsmall farm in New England, not small anyplace. And $10 million is a \ngood many sales. So small farm stories are not applicable to this issue \nat this time, although certainly they will be raised.\n  This issue, the issue of the sugar program, has been brought up on a \nnumber of occasions in this body. It has always been defeated. Any \nattempt to address the sugar program has been defeated. It was defeated \nlast year even in the midst of major rewriting of the farm programs \ngenerally, as I mentioned earlier. Defeated a couple of years ago. It \nhas always lost, but usually the amendments have been directed at \nsubstantive reform of the pricing mechanism. You know, this fact that \nyou, the consumers, are paying 23 cents for a pound of sugar when your \nneighbors, maybe relatives in Canada, are paying 13 cents.\n  So that has been the usual target of the amendments. That has been \nsoundly defeated because the influences I mentioned of so many \ndifferent groups growing this product around the country is so \npervasive. So my amendment--which the recourse issue does not take on \nthat core issue of pricing policy, although pricing policy certainly \nshould be addressed. And I would be happy to do it if I thought I had a \nchance of being successful. But I know I do not. My amendment takes on \nthe issue of recourse.\n  As a practical matter nobody in this body should object to this, \nbecause, as I mentioned, the price of the product has been made so high \nthat how can you object to the concept of having to pay back your loans \nwhen you are already getting such a huge subsidized price? Then if you \ncompare the fact that you are requiring people to pay back their loans \nwho are fairly large businesses--$10 million in sales--well, that is \nnot too outrageous, not too outrageous, to require them to pay back \ntheir loans.\n  So I am talking about really a peripheral amendment here. I have to \nadmit to that. I wish it was more at the heart of the sugar program. I \nwish it went to the pricing mechanism. But you know, I accept reality. \nI cannot win that one. I got 35 votes last year, probably about the \nsame this year. So what this amendment does--I hope my fellow Members \nof the Senate will take a look at it who voted against affecting the \npricing mechanism. It does not address that. So all the sugar beet \ngrowers and all the sugarcane growers are still going to get their 23 \ncents a pound out of the American consumer. They are going to get their \npound of sugar out of the American consumer.\n  What they should not get, however, is this nonrecourse treatment that \nwe do not give to students, we do not give to homeowners, we do not \ngive to veterans. I mean, let us have some decency around here. Let us \nadmit that we will let them go to the trough and maybe eat everything \nin it, but let us not let them eat the trough, too. It is getting a \nlittle outrageous.\n  So that is the purpose of this amendment. And I regret that the \ncontext of offering this amendment puts me in a difficult position, \nbecause I understand that I am not going to be protected on second-\ndegrees, and I understand I am not going to be protected on time. I \nwill say this, however, that I do think this is an important issue to \nvote on, that we will vote on this issue, I hope, before we complete \nthis bill. I have no desire to delay this bill.\n  I know the Senator from Mississippi and the Senator from Arkansas \nhave worked hard to move this bill quickly, and they have done a superb \njob of getting it out of committee. On the general farm programs, they \nhave done an extraordinary job of funding those in, I think, a \nresponsible way. This program, really, is independent of that effort. \nThey have done an excellent job on this bill. I do not want to delay \nit. I want the bill to get through as soon as it can.\n  I do think this has to be voted on. I hope when I send this amendment \nto the desk, it will not be subject to a second-degree amendment. It \ncan be couched in a variety of terms, so obviously we can return to \nthis issue if it is, ad nauseam.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4959\n\n     (Purpose: To prohibit the use of funds to make loans to large \n processors of sugarcane and sugar beets unless the loans require the \n    processors to repay the full amount of the loans, plus interest)\n\n  Mr. GREGG. I send the amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from New Hampshire [Mr. Gregg] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 4959.\n       At the end of the bill, add the following:\n\n     SEC.    . REPAYMENT OF CERTAIN SUGAR LOANS.\n\n       None of the funds appropriated or otherwise made available \n     by this Act may be used to make a loan to a processor of \n     sugarcane or sugar beets, or both, who has an annual revenue \n     that exceeds $10 million, unless the terms of the loan \n     require the processor to repay the full amount of the loan, \n     plus interest.\n\n  Mr. GREGG. I thank the clerk for reading the amendment. I did want \nthe whole amendment read so it would be understood. It is an amendment \nwhich on its face says, as I stated, if somebody is going to borrow \nfrom the Federal Government, even when they are getting twice the price \nfor their product they should be getting, if somebody is going to \nborrow from the Federal Government, they ought to pay the Federal \nGovernment back.\n  Now, some will claim they can take the sugar and then the Federal \nGovernment can sell the sugar. That is true, but if there is a \ndifference, the Federal Government eats the difference. There is no \nreason the Federal Government should be put at that risk. They are not \nput at risk for students, veterans or homeowners, so we should not be \nput at that risk for sugar growers simply because they have the \ncapacity to protect themselves in the legislative arena better than \nstudents, homeowners or veterans.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n\n[[Page S8441]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is now a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I was listening attentively to the Senator \ndescribe his amendment dealing with the issue of sugar. He finished by \ntalking about sugar growers. Of course, the Senator understands that no \none grows sugar; they grow sugar beets, to be sure, and the beets are \nprocessed into sugar.\n  The issue as presented by my colleague is an interesting issue and an \nimportant issue. This morning in North Dakota and elsewhere in the \ncountry, some folks got up and ate breakfast early. These were families \nwith a full day's work to do. They need to keep their machinery in \norder, tend to their land, look over their sugar beet crops. Farmers \nwork pretty hard. They invest a fair amount of money into a farmstead \nand try to make a living.\n  One of the circumstances we find in the farm programs is that there \nare difficult times for people who are out there living. There are \ndifficult times for those trying to make a living because there is so \nmuch uncertainty. You can plant, and in no time at all through a whole \nseries of things over which you have no control, you see everything \ngone. Acts of nature, a whole range of circumstances can conspire to \nwipe you out completely and quickly.\n  For that reason, the Federal Government has had a farm program. The \nFederal Government has said we believe there ought to be a network of \nfamily farmers in this country who have an opportunity to make it. So \nfor a whole series of farmers raising crops, we have tried to create a \nsafety net.\n  Now, within that farm program is a sugar program. The sugar program \ntries to provide a safety net for those folks, particularly in my part \nof the country, who raise sugar beets. As I listen to this debate, it \nis interesting how this issue is described because the description is \nso at odds with what the reality is.\n  I hear people stand on the floor of the Senate and talk about 10 \ncents being the world price for sugar. Well, that is not a legitimate \nfree-market price for sugar. That is the dump price for sugar. People \nwho study this issue understand that most sugar is traded country to \ncountry through long-term contracts. Only the residual sugar produced \nover that is dumped on the open market, at dump prices, dirt-cheap \nprices, and then some people say that is the true market price. \nNonsense. That is not the true market price. It has nothing to do with \na true free market price. It is a dump price for residual sugar \nsupplies above that which is needed and above that which is traded \ncountry to country.\n  In this country, we have developed a program that provides loans. \nThose loans, through the Commodity Credit Corporation, cannot be made \ndirectly to sugar cane and sugar beet growers because sugarcane and \nsugar beets are not storable commodities. So the loans are made to the \nraw cane farmers and the beet sugar processors. I must point out, in \nNorth Dakota, those processors are by and large cooperatives. Those \ncooperatives are owned by the growers. The growers are the farmers.\n  The fact is I am proud of what has happened under this sugar program. \nI am proud because we have a circumstance where one part of this farm \nprogram, at least, works well and works to provide some stability in \nprice to the beet growers--yes, in North Dakota and other parts of the \ncountry.\n  Now, that stability has given them an opportunity to make a living \nout there on the land. This is not, as some would suggest, some giant \ngiveaway program. It is not a program that will require people at the \ngrocery store to pay an extraordinarily high price for sugar. That is \nnot what the program is about.\n  This program happens to be one of the programs that I think is good \nfor both the producer and the consumer. It is especially good for those \nconsumers who care about whether producers are able to live on a family \nfarm, who understand that this matters to our country. I think it does \nmatter to our country. It is good not only for those objectives, but it \nis also good for the general consumer.\n  You go back some years and evaluate what happened in this country \nwhen we had a shortage of sugar, and sugar prices jumped up, \nskyrocketed at the grocery store counter. Then there was a lot of \nconcern about what this meant to the consumer. Well, the consumer, \nthen, had to pay more for sugar because we had uncertain supplies, \nunstable supplies.\n  What the sugar program has done is merge two different approaches. \nOne side of the approach says that we will try to provide something \nthat gives some price stability to those who raise beets. The other \nside of the approach says that we are going to provide an advantage to \nthe consumer who will have price stability on the grocery store shelf.\n  Is that price stability higher than it might be if, during years of \nworld surpluses, we could have accessed the cheapest possible dump \nprice for sugar? Sure. But is that price lower than it would be in \ntimes of shortage because we have a more stable capability in this \ncountry of providing for those needs? Yes. My point is this kind of \nprogram advantages both the producer, the family farmer being the \nproducer, and also the consumer.\n  We have fought this battle before. We have had those persons who feel \nstrongly about it come to the floor and say this is a program \ncompletely without merit. They say that it is a program that ought to \nbe abolished, and they have tried to abolish it in a dozen different \nways.\n  I must admit this amendment is a crafty technique, I say to my \ncolleague, to try to essentially obliterate the sugar program. However, \nCongress has reviewed this and Congress has said this program makes \nsense. This program is not costing the taxpayers money. It is a program \nthat has worked well. It is a program that has achieved its objectives \nof trying to provide some stability and some help for the family \nfarmers out there, who in my part of the country raise sugar beets. It \nis a program also that has the ancillary benefits of helping the \nconsumers in this country with some price stability.\n  Let me mention one other thing. As all of us know, in this debate \nthere are competing forces. There is a force out there in our country--\nmaybe I should not name it--that uses a great deal of sugar. The \ncompanies that make candy bars and other things use a great amount of \nsugar, and they very much want to see the dump price of sugar prevail \nfor a while in this country as the U.S. price. I understand that. I \nsuppose if that were my business, I would be arguing for the same \nthing. But that happens to be, in my judgment, a selfish position, \nlooking after only their own interests.\n  But there are other considerations. The Senate and the House have \ngone through this and debated to try to determine where the \nreconciliation is here. We have tried to discover how we do this the \nright way, and is there a need to provide some stability in the price \nof these commodities. Is there a reason to give a hard working family \nfarmer an opportunity to take advantage of that stability? The answer \nhas been yes. Do we want that level of stability to be something that \nis so artificially high that it injures others that are involved in \nother businesses? The answer to that is no. That is what the compromise \nhas been.\n  This compromise has been worked and reworked. I must say that I \ncompliment the Senator from Mississippi, Senator Cochran, and so many \nothers. Let me compliment someone who is leaving this Congress--\nCongressman Kika de la Garza. This is his last year in Congress. But \nthose who understand the sugar program, especially in modern days, and \nits genesis, understand that Kika de la Garza has played a large role \nin shaping it. Republicans and Democrats have thought this through to \ndetermine what is the best public policy here. They have, I think, come \nto a reasonable position of supporting the provisions that are now in \nlaw, provisions that I think make sense for this country.\n  On a broader question, one can always, it seems to me, on almost \nevery issue, come to the floor of the Senate and argue some kind of \nglobal construct that persuades us that there is a cheaper price \nsomewhere. You can always find a price or position, in some nook or \ncranny of the economy, that you can access and that somehow\n\n[[Page S8442]]\n\nwould be beneficial for the country. I do not think that is what we are \nsearching for. I think what we are searching for is public policy, \nespecially in the area of commodities, that represents this country's \ninterests.\n  Part of this country's interests lie in trying to maintain a network \nof family farms in our country. I am proud to tell you that at least \nNorth Dakota, one of the most agricultural States, has a network of \nfamily farms. The Red River Valley contains a network of those family \nfarms that are trying to raise sugar beets. They have come together in \ncooperatives that process the sugar beets and have been quite \nsuccessful. I commend them for it. I only wish that our farm programs \nfor other commodities were as successful as this program is.\n  It seems to me that it ill-behooves this Congress to take a look at \nwhat works and take that apart and stop it, as opposed to evaluating \nwhat does not work and seeing if we cannot fix it. It really does not \nserve our interests to start deciding that those things that do \nfunction well are things that we ought to try to mess up in one way or \nthe other.\n  So I very much admire the Senator who is the author of this \namendment. We have worked together on many things, and will again, but \nhe is dead wrong, in my judgment, on the sugar program. It is not new \nto him. He has been dead wrong on it for some long while. I know he \nfeels strongly about it. We have a fundamental disagreement. I do hope \nthat the Senate recognizes the balance that has been struck. I think it \nis good for producers and good for consumers.\n  It is a balance that augurs for this kind of a program to try to help \nfamily farmers in our country. I hope the Senate will, at the \nappropriate time, reject the amendment offered by Senator Gregg.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. CRAIG addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I come to the floor this afternoon, once \nagain, to find myself in opposition to my colleague from New Hampshire \non an issue that we both feel very strongly about. So for the next few \nmoments let me say to my colleague from New Hampshire that while I \ndisagree with him on this issue--and we very clearly disagree--we \nremain good friends and working partners on a lot of other issues. I \nmust look at his amendment and what he has said about his amendment in \nrelation to the sugar program in the new farm bill and take issue with \nit on an item-by-item basis, as I think is necessary. It is important \nfor the record, so that the facts of this issue come forward.\n  Mr. President, when I first came to Congress in 1980, I came from a \nfarming and ranching background, and for the 1980's, I remained \nactively involved with my family in farming and ranching. But I must \nsay that my family never was involved in raising program crops. So I, \nfrankly, did not know a lot about farm programs. I did not know a great \ndeal about farm programs and program crops. It was not until I became a \nCongressman, representing the First Congressional District of Idaho, \nthat I found it necessary to look at these programs on a program-by-\nprogram basis, Mr. President, and try to understand what they were all \nabout.\n  My colleague from New Hampshire and I are pretty much alike. We are \nfiscal conservatives. We tend to be free marketers. And so when I began \nto look at the sugar program, I saw something that I had heretofore not \nunderstood. One of the first things I found out about it was that no \ncheck went to the farmer. The farmer, whether he be a cane grower or a \nsugar beet raiser, never received a check from the Federal Government. \nThey received their payment from the sugar processor, who they were \ncontracted with to raise the beets, or to raise the cane. So there was \nno, if you will, direct subsidy to the farmer, direct check to the \nfarmer, as is true in other program crops.\n  One of the reasons this program had been developed, in a way, in that \nnature was because both the plant itself, the sugar beet, and the beet \nitself, in storage, are quite perishable. Because it was a nonrecourse \nloan program, it would not have been wise for the Federal Government, \nin this instance, to produce a loan when there was no collateral. And \nso as a method of even marketing into the system, it became the sugar \nprocessor who was the individual who took loans out from the Government \ninside a Government program, a sugar program, and they used, as \ncollateral, refined sugar. So there was no direct payment to the \nfarmer.\n  So the Senator from New Hampshire is wrong today. We will not hear a \nstory about the plight of the small farmer. The small farmer, in this \ncase the sugar beet raiser, whether it is in North Dakota or whether it \nis in Idaho, does not receive a check from the Federal Government. They \nreceive a stable price for their product from a refiner that is engaged \nin a nonrecourse loan program with the Federal Government, which allows \nthat refiner to market sugar into the market in a stable way.\n  So I am sorry that I will disappoint my colleague from New Hampshire. \nNo story about the plight of the small farmer. Although I am very much \nconcerned about the small farmer, I will tell my colleague from New \nHampshire, with the hundreds of thousands of acres of sugar beets in \nIdaho, it is a good and profitable crop. One of the reasons it is is \nnot because they get a check from the Government, but because the \nindustry, through the program, is allowed to develop a loan \nrelationship with the Federal Government, which creates stability in \nthe marketplace. Therefore, it affords a stable price for the crop, and \nthat creates stability at the farm itself. That is a point that I think \nis very important to remember.\n  So, in essence, the amendment that my colleague from New Hampshire is \noffering today, which is a cap, if you will--or it says loans are \nlimited to those under $10 million--there is not a refiner in the \nmarket that grosses less than $10 million. So the amendment, for all \nintents and purposes, destroys the sugar program as we know it.\n  The second point, this is not just a refinement of the existing \nprogram. This is a killer amendment of a program that we spent over 12 \nmonths negotiating about with the industry and the growers \nassociations. The reason we did that is because I, along with my \ncolleague from New Hampshire, said it was time to reform the farm bill \nand get Government out of agriculture as much as we could. As a result \nof that, we put major reforms into the sugar program.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Will the Senator yield for a moment on that point?\n  Mr. CRAIG. Yes.\n  Mr. DORGAN. The Senator talked about family farmers. I want to try to \nunderstand the point he made.\n  The point, as I understand it, is not that this does not help family \nfarmers. This ultimately does help family farmers. But it helps family \nfarmers through price stability--not a Government check. I think that \nis the point the Senator from Idaho was making.\n  The reason I asked the question is that I was making the point that \nthis matters to a lot of family farmers. It matters because if you \ndestroy this program you destroy their price stability; and, frankly, a \nlot of them will not be farming anymore. But this is not a Government \ncheck to those farmers. As the Senator from Idaho properly said, it \nhelps the processors to provide price stability for farmers, which is \nexactly what makes this a successful program and one that does not cost \nthe taxpayers' money.\n  I appreciate very much the Senator yielding.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, so the point I think that my colleague and \nI are trying to make here is that, if there is a role for Government in \nagriculture--I think there is one, and I think it ought to be a very \nlimited one--I see it in one of two or three areas. That is not to \ndirectly prop up or to subsidize a producer who has to produce to a \nmarket but allowing Government to help facilitate at no cost to the \ntaxpayers anomalies within a market environment that only the \nGovernment can maybe help in because of their scope and their size, or \nin an instance where there is direct competition from foreign markets \nin which cheap product is produced either because of ``near slave \nlabor'' or because of subsidized Government programs in other producing \nareas of the world than the necessity of a relationship there where our \nGovernment can facilitate without it being a cost to the taxpayer.\n\n[[Page S8443]]\n\n  In all of those instances the sugar program meets those tests. In the \narea of trade, where you have real political consideration and \npolitical powers vying against each other that distort the marketplace, \nI believe our Government can be a facilitator to production \nagriculture, and it works in this instance. And it works so to create \nstability in the marketplace. When you create stability in the \nmarketplace you benefit the small farmer producer, and you do in real \nterms because you do not have the kind of gyrations in the market where \none year wheat is worth a great deal of money and the next year you \nought to plow it under because it is worth no money. That is the kind \nof instability we saw in the sugar pProgram in the late 1970's and the \nearly 1980's.\n  Those are some of the issues and items that I learned, Mr. President, \nwhen I got here as a freshman Congressman and I knew very little about \nsugar. I also learned something else: That when we began to make \nreforms in the program starting back in 1980 when we found out that we \ncould not operate under the kind of program we were living under, and \nbecause of the boom and bust in the marketplace, with the tremendous \ninfluence of dumping raw cheap foreign sugar on our market we came back \nto a Government program, or at least a program where the Government \nbecame a participant to facilitate.\n  When we did that we said something very important. We said that this \nought not be a subsidy--that it ought to be no net cost to the \ntaxpayer.\n  Since 1980 my colleague from New Hampshire knows as well as I do that \nthis has been a no net cost to the taxpayer because that is what the \nlaw says. And in that context, while I was listening to my colleague a \nfew moments ago, I became frustrated when he began to insinuate that \nthis was costing the taxpayer money--or that in fact it was costing the \nGovernment money--that is a nonrecourse loan if defaulted upon costs \nthe taxpayer money.\n  Two years ago, when we did have some default because the loans were \ncollateralized on refined sugar, the Government took the sugar, sold \nit, and made money--no net cost. Technically inside the law my \ncolleague from New Hampshire, the Senator from New Hampshire, is right. \nFrom a technical point of view he is absolutely right--that, if the \nprice of refined sugar had dropped dramatically, there might be a loss. \nBut the law says no net cost to taxpayers.\n  As a result of that we have put the loan rate at a rate to cover \nthose margins, and it has no cost. He used an example of the veterans; \nthe homeowner. I must tell my colleague from New Hampshire, my Senator \nfriend, that he knows this--that when the Government loans money on a \nhouse they have the house as collateral. And if the person who borrows \nwalks away from the house--and that happens--the Government has the \nhouse and they sell the house. They have the sugar and they sell the \nsugar.\n  He used student loans. Student loans are the only area where \nGovernment loans do not have collateral. Many students have walked away \nfrom their loans and the taxpayers had to eat them. That was \nincreasingly so until the Senator from New Hampshire and I came in the \nearly 1980's and said, ``No. You can't do that kind of thing anymore. \nIf we are going to loan money to students they have to pay it back.'' \nThat became an increasing prerequisite of student loans throughout the \n1980's and into the 1990's as we increasingly provided more money in \nthe student loan program.\n  So if you loan money to a GI, in many instances on education, that is \nan outright gift. If you loan money to a student, you hope they pay it \nback. They are obligated to pay it back. If they declare bankruptcy and \nwalk away from it, even though we put a no-bankruptcy clause in, some \nof them do not. Most of them do, thank goodness. But if the Federal \nGovernment borrows money on a house and the person walks away from the \nhouse, they can follow the person legally through the channels; and, if \nthe person does not have any money, the Government has the house. That \nis the reality. We know those things.\n  In a nonrecourse loan to the refiner the Government has the sugar. \nThe example of default cannot be painted to be dramatic because it \nhardly exists. It rarely exists. Over the last 2 years it has existed, \nand, when it did, the Government took the refined sugar, sold it, and \nmade a little money above and beyond their expenses.\n  Mr. President, if the Government can operate a program like that that \ncreates stability in the marketplace, that keeps thousands of farmers \nproducing, that disallows the dumping of cheap sugar in our market and \ndoes so in a way that is of no net cost to the taxpayer, I would say \nthat is probably a pretty good program. Maybe that is the way \nGovernment ought to work in this instance. It creates the kind of \nstability we want.\n  The amendment that the Senator from New Hampshire offers imposes an \neligibility test for participation in what is now a new sugar program. \nFor over 12 months we worked at defining a new program, and we put it \nin a 7-year farm bill. Growers began to plant to that farm bill this \nspring.\n  I would have hoped that my colleague would have accepted those \nreforms. But I understand that he does not. He wants the program \neliminated. That is his choice to offer on the floor his amendment, and \nclearly he does that because nobody in my opinion can largely agree \nwith his $10 million revenue threshold to establish it. If a refined \ncane miller or a sugar beet processor has annual revenue which exceeds \n$10 million they are not eligible for the program as written in the \nfarm bill. Currently all U.S. raw cane millers and sugar beet \nprocessors have annual revenues above $10 million. Thus, no domestic \nproduced sugar would be eligible for current loan programs if this \namendment were enacted. This amendment will invalidate and render \nuseless the hard-fought reform that I have just mentioned that won on \nthis floor of the Senate by 61 to 35 vote.\n  In the loan program, while I think I have discussed that in a \nreasonably thorough way, Mr. President, USDA cannot make loans directly \nto the sugarcane or the sugar beet grower, as I have mentioned.\n  The reason is that raw sugarcane and beets are perishable, and \nalthough my colleague did not specifically speak to the \ncollateralization of the loan, the loans are collateralized by refined \nsugar, and that is why the Government has not lost any money on this, \nnot only by actual practice but by the law itself.\n  The loan rate for raw cane sugar is 18 cents under the new program \nand has been frozen at that level since 1985. The farm bill makes that \nfreeze level a permanent one. The current loan rate is well below the \ndomestic market price of 22 cents. So you have that cushion of \nprotection between the 18 cents and the 22 cents.\n  USDA loans on sugar have consistently been repaid, as I have \nmentioned, with interest. It sounds as if our Government, in this \ninstance, was a pretty good banker. The sugar program has been operated \nat no net cost. Meanwhile, U.S. consumers continue to buy sugar at a \nprice some 28 percent below the average price in the rest of the \nworld's developed countries.\n  For just a moment, Mr. President, let me speak briefly again about \nthe nonrecourse versus recourse loans that go to the heart of the \namendment of the Senator from New Hampshire. Currently, all sugar \nloans, along with wheat, cotton, rice, and corn, are nonrecourse loans. \nThis means that the only way to collect repayment of the loan is to \nassume the collateral. Rather than collect massive stocks, USDA \noperates the program so that there are no loan forfeitures or cost to \nthe Government.\n  What the opponents suggest is that this system be changed to \nbasically a recourse loan program and the $10 million threshold. Under \nthis system, the Government could use any means necessary to collect \nthe value of a loan. No other commodity has a recourse loan.\n  Those are some facts that I think are extremely important as we deal \nwith this issue.\n  Mr. President, because we are now just at the beginning of a new farm \nbill, and while all of us spent nearly 2 years crafting this document--\nand the Senator from New Hampshire was directly involved in trying to \nchange it with amendments in this Chamber, which was certainly his \nright and his prerogative, so he and I and everyone\n\n[[Page S8444]]\n\nelse have had a substantial part in shaping the new farm policy, but we \ndid it. We put it in effect for 7 years. As a result of that, scores of \nfarm organizations around the country have said now it is time to leave \nit alone and let it work for a while under the promises that the \nGovernment collectively made would be a part of the program.\n  The American Farm Bureau Federation, the American Sheep Industry, the \nSociety of Farm Managers and Rural Appraisers, the Soybean Association, \nNational Association of Wheat Growers and Barley Growers, the National \nCorn Association, the National Cotton Council, the National Council of \nFarm Cooperatives, the National Sorghum Producers, the National Milk \nProducers Federation, the National Peanut Growers Association, the \nNational Pork Producers Association, and the National Sugar Farmers and \nProcessors, all of them have basically said now that you have crafted a \nfarm bill, we urge you to stay with it because this is something you \njust do not change overnight. Certainly in my State of Idaho, the \nmillions and millions of dollars of investment it takes to farm and to \nproduce means that you do not quickly change the program if you change \nit overnight. Of course, the Congress has the right to do that. But we \nunderstand the importance of making sure that the program is stable.\n  I hope I have portrayed my opinion of the effects of this amendment \nby the Senator from New Hampshire. If not, I am sure he will correct \nme, and I will stand corrected if I am wrong. But I think it is \nimportant to remember that this is a program that since the early \n1980's we have refined and shaped and reshaped so that we create \nstability in the market; that we offer a supply of sugar which is \nsubstantially less expensive than sugar and sweetener around the world; \nthat we are in compliance with GATT, and as we move toward that, one of \nthe things which is clearly understandable is that our level of \nparticipation in the program reduces as other governments around the \nworld subsidize, sugar levels reduce because of the General Agreement \non Tariffs and Trade. All of that is part of how our Government has \nworked, and I believe properly so, under the direction of the Congress \nand under the new farm bill that we have before us.\n  So I hope that my colleagues in reviewing this amendment will reject \nit. I certainly do not plan to second degree it, and I do not know of \nanyone else who does. It is not my intention to want to put cute words \naround it, to try to hide the impact. I believe this program is strong \nenough to stand on its own, as it has in the past, as it did by a 61 to \n35 vote several months ago on the floor of the Senate. And I hope that \nSenators, in reviewing this, could reject it out of hand and allow the \nprogram, which we have effectively refined and developed, to operate \nfor a period of time to see if we get the savings.\n  Let me also conclude by saying that one of the things which is very \nimportant to remember--and I am not sure whether the Senator's \namendment would therefore forfeit this figure--one of the results of \nthe program and the no net cost to the taxpayer is the assessments that \nare generated through the new program that will produce about $300 \nmillion in deficit reduction.\n  Now, if the Senator is still going to say let us keep the assessments \nbut let us kill the program, then, in essence, he has created a new tax \non producers, because we not only eliminated marketing allotments, we \nimplemented a 1-cent penalty effectively lowering loan rates and we \nhave an assessment that will generate about $300 million in deficit \nreduction to the Treasury over the life of the program of 7 years. As a \nresult of that, we think we have put together a positive reform package \nnot only for the American taxpayer, but, in this instance, for the \nproducer-processor to create a stable market for the commodity that \nthey produce.\n  I yield back the time.\n  Mr. GREGG addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. I certainly appreciate the eloquence and the \naggressiveness and obviously the effectiveness of the Senator from \nNorth Dakota and the Senator from Idaho in defending the sugar program \nas it impacts their sugar beet growers who, in most instances, I \nsuspect--I suspect in all instances--are very hard working, farm \ncommunity votes. However, the sugar program itself is structured in a \nway that it benefits a lot of major corporate farm activity, and that \nfarm activity, as I mentioned before, is extraordinarily expensive to \nthe American consumer in an unfair and unjust and unmarket-oriented \nway.\n  The argument on the other side appears to have fallen into a few \ncategories. Let me try to respond to them in some sort of argument.\n  The first argument is that this amendment would eliminate the program \nbecause any processor doing more than $10 million in business would be \nout of the program. No, that is not true. I think that is simply not \ntrue. It would say that any processor who generates more than $10 \nmillion in annual sales would have to pay their loans back--just like a \nstudent, just like a veteran, just like a homeowner.\n  Now, there was some representation that we do not collect veterans' \nloans and maybe they are an outright gift. I do not think so. I think \nmost veterans pay back their loans, but if they are not paid back, the \nFederal Government has the right to go after them individually. The \nsame thing of a student. If a student does not pay back his or her \nloan--it happens a lot, unfortunately--the Federal Government has the \nright to collect that. Of course, in the homeowner's situation, that is \na collateralized event. The Federal Government takes the home, sells \nthe home, but if there is a deficiency, in other words, if there is a \ndifference between what that home is sold for under foreclosure and \nwhat the note is paid out for and the note exceeded the foreclosure \nprice of the loan, the individual remains personally responsible for \nthat amount.\n  What we are suggesting is that a $10 million processor as a \nconsortium, as a co-op or as a manufacturing cooperation, the $10 \nmillion processor should have to be liable also just like the student \nis, just like the veteran is, just like the homeowner is for that loan. \nSo the program is still very much available. It is available under \napproximately the same terms and conditions relative to default and \nrecovery that a loan to a student is, that a loan to a veteran is, and \nthat a loan to a HUD recipient of a home ownership loan is. You have to \npay the loan. You have to pay back the Government. That is all we are \nasking.\n\n  So the program is very much vibrant and alive. To reflect the fact \nthat there is a sort of inherent contradiction in this debate that I \nhear from the other side, the position of the other side, on the one \nhand, they are saying this proposal, which is to allow people to borrow \nthe money but to have to pay it back, versus borrow the money and then \nif they decide they do not want to pay it back they can just turn over \ntheir sugar to the Government--that this proposal is going to have a \ndisastrous, debilitating, totally scorched earth effect on the farm \nprogram; and then I heard that nobody has ever defaulted, or if there \nhas been a default they sold the collateral for more than the loan was \nworth.\n  So why is this such a terrible event? Why is it such a terrible event \nto make it a matter of public policy that people who borrow money from \nthe Federal Government should pay it back? I guess it is a terrible \nevent because it happens to be perceived, I think, as a threat to the \nsugar growers and the sugar processors. They maybe see it as a camel's-\nnose-under-the-tent approach to the issue of their $1.4 billion subsidy \nwhich they are taking the American consumer to the cleaners with.\n  But, as a practical matter, the debate on the other side of this \nissue has defended the position I have proposed in this amendment, \nbecause they have stated accurately that there have been no defaults \nthat would have created recourse beyond the collateral, and, therefore, \nwhy should it matter to the industry if they find themselves subject to \nrecourse loans? Especially when you have an Agriculture Department that \nis controlling the importation of sugar so it keeps the price of sugar \n4 to 5 cents above what the loan price is? I mean, really. It is like \ngoing into a blackjack game and saying, ``You have to deal me both an \nace and a jack. If you do not deal me the ace and the jack, I am not \ngoing to play.''\n  In this case we are going to give them the ace and the jack, I guess. \nBut\n\n[[Page S8445]]\n\nit makes no sense, that if they should, by some strange coincidence end \nup losing, they should not at least expect the Federal Government \nshould be paid back. It is hard to believe there is a scenario where \nunder the present scenario they would lose. As long as the Department \nof Agriculture is going to keep the price 4 cents or 5 cents above the \nloan price, how do you ever end up with the collateral being less than \nthe loan? It is pretty hard to see that fact pattern occurring.\n  But I am told this amendment devastates the program. How does it \ndevastate a program when the defense of the opposition has been that \nthere has never been a default, and when the numbers, on their face, \nspeak for themselves that if there were a default, there would not be \nany recourse?\n  No, I do not think it devastates the program. It does not affect the \nprogram at all. That was my point when I first started this. I said, \n``Gee, I would really like to do something about this program but I \nknow I cannot win. But let us at least get ourselves on some sort of \neven keel relative to the American taxpayer and relative to fairness. \nIf we are going to say to the homeowner and the student and the veteran \nyou have to pay your loans back, let us say to the processor you have \nto pay your loan back, too. That is the purpose of this.''\n  So I do not think there is any substance to that argument. I think \nthe substance of it was undermined by the presentation of the defense. \nTo the effect there was a substantive point made in the opposition, it \nwent to the issue of this price stability, which was specifically \nstated by the Senator from North Dakota and clearly implied and alluded \nto by the Senator from Idaho.\n  Essentially, the theme of that position was that if you do not have \nprice stability in sugar, then you are going to have up-and-down years, \nyou are going to have years when the price will go down, when there is \ndumping, and years when the price will go up. So the idea is to have 23 \ncents or 22 cents all the time for sugar, even though the world market \nprice is 13 cents. Granted that may be a dump price, for all I know. It \nmay not be, but it could be a dumped price. But there is clearly a heck \nof a lot of difference, there is a big difference between 22 cents, 23 \ncents, and 13 cents. So somewhere in there is the real price of sugar \none presumes, between those two numbers. It is pretty obvious the \nAmerican consumer is paying a lot more than the real price, if the \nworld dump market is 13 cents.\n  So, if that is the case, if the purpose here is to maintain a stable \nprice for sugar, if that is the real gravamen of the argument, and that \nprice always has to be 23 cents or 22 cents--and why is that number \npicked? That number is picked because the loan price is 18 cents and \nthey do not want anybody defaulting on their loan. If we apply that \nlogic to all the commodities made in this country: All right, let us \nsee, now. A couple of weeks ago my son bought a MacIntosh computer. I \nbought it for him for his birthday. The price of that computer, as I \nrecall, was somewhere in the $1,500 range. It was a pretty expensive \nitem, but it was for schooling. It seemed like a good investment. His \nsisters can use it.\n  All prices of all computers should be $1,500--right? The theory of \nthe sugar program is the price for a commodity should be the same price \nat all times, because the prices might go up and the prices might go \ndown; if you want to maintain stability--we have a lot more people \nworking in the old computer industry in this world, in the Apple \ncomputer industry, I suspect, than make sugar. I bet there are probably \nmore people that work for Apple Computer than produce sugar.\n  What has happened to Apple computers because they have not had a \nDepartment of Agriculture fixing the price of that product? The prices \nwent down. I found out a few days ago I could have bought the same \ncomputer I bought a few months ago for $400 less, because there is \nsomething called a price war going on in the computer industry. And, \nworse than that, for the folks at Apple, they are in serious trouble. \nThey have had to lay off thousands of people, because their product was \nnot able to maintain the employment. And the prices of computers and \nother computers that have been brought on the market that have made \nthat Apple computer, which is a heck of a good computer, I think--\nespecially the software in it--be not as competitive with whatever the \nappropriate other computer that is competing: Dell, AST, Gateway, \nDigital. Digital is a great computer, by the way--made in New \nHampshire.\n  The point here, of course, is: It is called a marketplace. It is \ncalled America. It is called a market system. It is called capitalism. \nIt is called ``what made this country great.'' It is called \ncompetition, worldwide, sometimes.\n  Take another little commodity called cars. Shall we fix all \nChevrolets at the price of Chevrolets sold in the year 1979 or 1985? We \ncould, I suppose. Then we would not allow the Japanese to import to \ncompete.\n  I think we went through that, did we not? That is why the Big Three \nhad such a tough time, because their quality went down because they did \nnot have the competition. Prices stayed up. Then, when they did get the \ncompetition, it took them a while to turn around. Of course, with \nAmerican know-how they did it pretty quickly, didn't they?\n  Now you have the most viable and energized car producers in the \nworld, and they are American again. For a while, of course, we had a \nhuge Japanese threat to our industry, but we responded.\n  Are we to say that the sugar growers in this country would not be \nable to compete? I do not know, I guess that is exactly what we are \nsaying in this plan. But, essentially, this concept of stable prices, \nwhich has been alluded to specifically by the Senator from North Dakota \nand clearly highlighted or addressed by the Senator from Idaho, is \nanother term for non-market-place economy. It is another term for price \nfixing. Price fixing does not benefit the consumer. It does not benefit \nthe marketplace. It benefits that small group of people who are able to \nbenefit from the fixed price which, in this case, happens to be a very \nsmall group of sugar growers, and it is extremely expensive to the \nAmerican economy.\n  There was a statement that there are no tax dollars at risk; the \ntaxpayers pay nothing. Well, if you say that the dollar that a taxpayer \npays in taxes and a dollar a taxpayer takes out of his wallet to pay \nfor sugar does not come out of the same wallet, then I guess taxpayers \nare not impacted. If the taxpayers are some mythical beings out there \nwho don't go to the marketplace and buy food then, yes, there is no \nimpact on the taxpayers.\n  But if the taxpayers happen to be real, live Americans who go down to \nthe grocery store and buy food with those dollars that are left over \nafter the Government takes their money for taxes, well, then it does \nimpact them quite a bit, because they are paying somewhere around twice \nthe going rate for the price of sugar. They are paying $1.4 billion a \nyear more to buy that sugar than they should have to. But this \namendment does not address that issue, that outrageous issue which I \nwould love to address. Unfortunately, I cannot get the votes to address \nit. But this amendment does not address that issue. This amendment \naddresses the fact that these are loans that do not get paid back if \nthey go bad.\n  Granted, it may never happen. It may never happen that the \nAgriculture Department is able to manipulate, through controlling \nimports, something that comes close enough to the loan price so that \nthere never is a loan that goes bad. But there ought to be a statement \nof policy, at least, that this Congress expects the $10 million \nprocessor to at least be as liable for his or her loans or its loans \nfrom the Federal Government as we expect the struggling student, the \nveteran and the homeowner.\n  There were a couple of ancillary issues that were raised that I think \nneed to be addressed. Maybe I already addressed them. I was even more \nthorough than I thought in my statement, so I yield back the remainder \nof my time.\n  Mr. COCHRAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, let me compliment those who participated \nin this debate for the efforts they made to fully acquaint the Senate \nwith the issue that is before us with the amendment offered by the \nSenator from New Hampshire.\n\n[[Page S8446]]\n\n  My reaction to it at this point is that this is an issue that has \nbeen before the Senate, was before the Senate, was fully debated when \nwe were undertaking to write the new farm bill, which contained a lot \nof market transition reforms, included reforms in the Sugar Program and \nmany others, and this issue has been resolved, or at least a bill was \npassed by the House and Senate, a conference occurred, a conference \nreport was written.\n  This is the conference report that was compiled by conferees on the \npart of the House and the Senate, almost 500 pages in length, devoted \nto farm programs and the role of the Federal Government and the private \nsector in trying to make available to Americans abundant supplies of \nreasonably priced foods and commodities.\n  The President signed the bill, and this is the law. The bill before \nthe Senate today simply funds the activities of the Department of \nAgriculture and related agencies. It doesn't seek to address suggested \nchanges in agriculture or farm policy, as such, but simply to undertake \nto allocate to this Department the funds it needs to carry out its \nresponsibilities as defined by the law.\n  So this is a proposal by the Senator from New Hampshire to change the \nlaw and, therefore, it seems to me ought not to be adopted by the \nSenate. It is very technical, obviously. I was reading section 156 in \nthe conference report that deals with the Sugar Program, and it talks \nabout the nonrecourse and the recourse loans that are a part of that \nprogram, and it is very, very technical.\n  I was thinking, how is a Senator who is not a member of the \nAgriculture Committee, has not been a party to the hearings and \ndiscussions about how this is going to work as a practical matter, how \nis he going to be able to decide, how is she going to be able to decide \nwhether this is an amendment they want to vote for or against.\n  These are arguments that have been made on both sides of the issues. \nI compliment the Senators involved. I think the only thing we can be \nsure of is we will vote on this. We will vote on this amendment. The \nyeas and nays have been ordered, and the vote will occur in due course \nof proceeding on this bill. It will not occur today. But under the \norder entered for the consideration of the bill today, it would be put \nover and a vote will occur tomorrow.\n  I am going to have to come down on the side of the Senator from Idaho \nand the Senator from North Dakota in arguing that the amendment be \nvoted down. I hope Senators will vote against the amendment, with due \nrespect to my very good friend from New Hampshire, whom I admire \ngreatly.\n  Mr. President, we are prepared to receive other amendments, or any \nfurther debate on this amendment would be in order if Senators care to \ndebate the amendment.\n  Mr. McCAIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4968\n\n (Purpose: To restore funding for the Agriculture Research Service at \n          the level approved by the House of Representatives)\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the pending \namendment be set aside, and I send an amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Arizona [Mr. McCain] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 4968.\n       On page 10, line 18, strike ``$721,758,000'' and insert in \n     lieu thereof ``$702,831,000''.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, this amendment would restore the funding \nlevel for the Agriculture Research Service at the House-passed amount. \nSimply, if the amendment is adopted, we will save $18,927,000, which \nrepresents a 3-percent cut from the Senate level.\n  No Agriculture Research Service programs will be put in jeopardy. No \ndire outcome will result. Mr. President, it is a very simple amendment. \nWhile the Senate does not and should not function as a rubber stamp of \nHouse action, the other body was entirely correct when it funded the \nAgriculture Research Service at $702,831,000.\n  Mr. President, in the Department of Agriculture appropriations bill, \na lot of the unnecessary spending is in the Agriculture Research \nService program. Certainly, there is a legitimate need for agricultural \nresearch. We all agree on that point.\n  Let me emphasize, voting for this amendment will not contradict that \npoint. Voting for the amendment does affirm our belief that we must \nscale back our spending in a responsible manner.\n  The House funded the Agriculture Research Service at a very \nreasonable level at $702 million. Again, I want to note that this is a \n3-percent cut from the Senate level. I believe that we could cut this \nnearly $1 billion program by 3 percent.\n  Mr. President, there is other language in the bill and in the \naccompanying committee report that concerns me. I would like to raise \nsome of those issues at this time. On page 51 of the bill, the House \nhad language that stated no funding made available under this title \nshall be used for new studies and evaluations. I applaud the House for \ninserting this prohibition in the bill. Unfortunately, the Senate \nstruck the House provision and inserted instead the $6 million cap on \nstudies and evaluations. Unfortunately, many of these studies are not \nnecessary or could be privately funded. I hope that when the bill is \nconferenced, the Senate will recede to the House on this matter.\n  The committee report continues to recommend funding for a wide \nvariety of specific industry areas. I believe that such earmarking is \ndetrimental to the agriculture industry as a whole because it \nencourages funding to go to those industries with the best lobbyists or \nthose favored by the members of the committee. All research grants \nshould be based on national priority and competitive bid.\n  As an example, I would like to comment briefly on the shrimp \naquaculture research provisions contained on page 39 of the committee \nreport. The committee recommended a $300,000 increase in Federal \nfunding for shrimp research. Mr. President, the U.S. shrimp industry is \na profitable, multibillion-dollar-a-year industry. While it is true \nthat the Asian shrimp industry is much larger than the U.S. shrimp \nindustry--I understand that some desire that we should have an American \nsource of shrimp--it seems that increased Government funding of the \nshrimp industry is not needed at this time.\n  Mr. President, my staff met with shrimp industry representatives who \nexplained their ongoing concern with foreign diseases infiltrating our \nnational shrimp farms. I share their concern. However, since the shrimp \nindustry is a profitable industry, and since the Federal Government \nalready spends over $3 million a year on shrimp aquaculture research, \nthis new financial need should be met by the shrimp industry itself.\n  Again, I hope when the bill goes to conference that the House demand \nits language on this matter and that Federal involvement with the \nshrimp industry be kept at a minimum.\n  I also want to express my concern that the Senate added language to \nthe bill on page 33 that funds the National Natural Resources \nConservation Foundation at no more than $250,000. This sounds very \ngood, but it raises many questions. First, according to the act which \nestablished the National Natural Resources Conservation Foundation, \nPublic Law 104-127, the foundation is ``a charitable and non profit \ncorporation * * * [and] is not an agency or instrumentality of the \nUnited States.''\n  The law also notes the numerous duties of the foundation, many of \nwhich I agree with. But I want to note that the last of the duties \nproscribed in the law for this private corporation is ``[to] raise \nprivate funds to promote the purposes of the foundation.'' The law \nstates this is a private organization that should raise funds and \npromote certain agricultural activities. I think we should let the \ncorporation follow that law.\n  Mr. President, isn't the concept of a private corporation that it is \nprivate, therefore, not funded by the Federal Government? In general, \nprivate corporations should not be funded with Federal dollars. I hope \nthe Secretary of the Department of Agriculture will not use any \nappropriated money to fund this organization. While there is a \nlegitimate role for some Federal dollars to be used by private \ncorporations for certain select activities that are necessary but which \nmight otherwise go\n\n[[Page S8447]]\n\nunfunded, this is not one of those exceptions.\n  Again, Mr. President, this is a simple amendment. It represents a 3-\npercent cut in the Agriculture Research Service program and restores \nthe House of Representatives-passed funding level for the program. I \nhope the Senate will adopt the amendment.\n  Mr. President, I have read the report language of the bill rather \ncarefully. There are many worthwhile and worthy causes. Some of them I \ndo not quite understand. Some of them are somewhat unusual, to say the \nleast. Grape research, hops, insect rearing, goat grass control, \nnutrition intervention projects, cotton value-added/quality research, \napple research, alfalfa research, corn germplasm research.\n  Mr. President, all these, I am sure, are worthwhile, but many \nAmericans who are facing cuts in Medicare, cuts in Medicaid, cuts in \nfood stamps, Social Security being in financial jeopardy would ask the \nquestion--and I think it is a legitimate one--should the taxpayers be \npaying for a fish farming experiment laboratory? Should the taxpayers \nbe paying for cotton value-added/quality research? Should the taxpayers \nbe paying for corn germplasm research? Apple research? Alfalfa \nresearch? Funding children's hospitals?\n  Mr. President, the question, I think, is a legitimate one. I have no \ninformation that the apple industry in America is in such dire straits \nthat they need to have Federal dollars spent on apple research. I \nwonder if the apple industry in America could pay for apple research. I \nhave no information that the Arkansas children's hospital is in such \nbad shape that it needs to have an additional $425,000 of taxpayers' \ndollars.\n  Bee research. I did not know that the Hayden Bee ARS Laboratory in \nTucson, AZ, required earmarked funding. Mr. President, I did not know \nthat the wheat industry was in such bad shape that it needed an \nadditional $450,000 above the 1996 level for the ARS Pacific Northwest \nClub Wheat Breeding Program.\n  What I am saying, Mr. President, is it all gets down to the question \nabout the role of government in our society. I was under the distinct \nimpression that, at least on this side of the aisle, Members felt that \nthe role of government in our society should be prioritized to provide \nfor national security and for those in our society who are unable to \ntake care of themselves who need our help, and certainly otherwise \nimportant programs.\n  I do not understand the logic behind funding with taxpayers' dollars \nindustry, whether it be fish farms or grapes or cotton or wheat or \nbees, when those industries are not only not in need, but according to \nthe information I have received that agriculture is one of the \nhealthiest industries in America.\n  So I hope that we will make a modest cut and restore the House level \nof funding. Mr. President, I have very few illusions as to the \nprospects of this amendment, but I would suggest that sooner or later \nthe American people will continue to question and question severely \nthis kind of funding. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays on the \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There is a \nsufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, let me respond to the Senator from \nArizona by saying that when we looked at the President's budget request \nfor funding of the Agriculture Research Service activities, we, too, \nthought that the request was too high. Our careful evaluation of the \nneeds for research done by the Agriculture Research Service resulted in \nour reducing the amount available for this activity by $7 million. So \nthe proposal that is before the Senate is $7 million less than \nrequested by the administration.\n  Let me also point out one other thing. I noticed the Senator's \namendment would cut $18 million from the Senate-recommended figure, $18 \nmillion from what the Senate recommended. We are already $7 million \nbelow the President's request. He does that, he says, to bring our \nnumber to the point where we would agree with the House on the level of \nfunding for these activities. The House number is $702 million in \ntotal. The bad part is, if you look at the House numbers individually \nin all the items in the bill that the House says should be funded, it \nadds up to $710 million more or less.\n  Draw the bottom line and put $702 million. He wants us to join that \nhocus-pocus and suggest we want individual projects funded up and down \nthe line in their bill, and if you add them all up it is $710 million, \nround numbers, but they draw the bottom line and put $702. I will not \nsubmit a bill to the floor of this Senate and do that and say I am \ncutting spending more than we really are recommending when you look at \nthe individual items.\n  What they are forcing the Department of Agriculture to do, if the \nSenate goes along with that, we are misrepresenting to the general \npublic, we are misrepresenting to the Department of Agriculture, what \nour recommendation is. We are forcing the Department to pick out $7 \nmillion in cuts and impose them somewhere, and disavowing any \nconnection with it. We are disavowing paternity with a $7 million cut.\n  If we are going to impose the cut to $702 million, identify where the \ncuts are going to be. If you are going to cut the Arkansas Research \nProgram that the Department of Agriculture runs, you have to spell it \nout. If you are going to cut an Arizona cotton research activity that \nis a substantial investment of dollars in a new facility, say it. Say \nyou are cutting western cotton research, and point out it is done in \nArizona. Just to simply say we are spending more than we need but not \nsay how, where, when, or to what extent, that is not right.\n  Now, after the Senator completed his proposal where he makes this $18 \nmillion cut, he then talked about other parts of the bill he found \nobnoxious that do not have anything to do with Agricultural Research \nService funding. If there are programs that should not be funded, I \nsuggest we ought to spell it out. Amendments ought to target those \nprojects. If that is what the complaint is, offer an amendment that \ndoes that. But to offer an across-the-board cut which if we passed \nwould force the Department to make the decisions, we would not have any \nresponsibility for doing that. That is irresponsibility. That is not \naccountability.\n  I sympathize with the Senator's proposal that we make sure the \ndollars that are invested in research are, No. 1, needed, serve some \npublic interest, are reviewed carefully. I can assure the Senate and I \ncan assure the Senator from Arizona that will be undertaken here.\n  He did specifically mention shrimp research for shrimp farming \noperations and how they were money-making enterprises and they did not \nneed the research dollars. I convened a hearing just on that issue last \nyear to determine what some of the problems were in aquaculture in \nfresh water, some salt water shrimp and other aquaculture activities. I \nfound out there was an epidemic of exotic viruses that have attacked \nthe shrimp in those operations and we were, in exchange, importing huge \nquantities of shrimp from China and other foreign sources because we \ncould not meet the supplies needed here for wholesome, safe shrimp and \nother seafood. This was a growing industry. It was one that had a lot \nof promise but it was about to be wiped out. These funds that are made \navailable are made available on condition that the industry come up \nwith its own money to help match the dollars that are put up by the \nGovernment to get to the bottom of this problem, and it is a problem.\n  Here is the hearing. This is a hearing record. This is not something \nthe industry just came in and tried to push over on us. I am convinced \nthe dollars that are made available for that activity are needed. The \npurpose, to provide high health and genetically improved stocks, to \ncontrol disease agents, to enhance environmental protection, and to \ndevelop animal husbandry methods. All of this is needed if we are going \nto save this industry from a doom, a doom that will cause us to have to \nrely on foreign sources of these products. We already do. But we will \nbe completely reliant on them if we are not careful, if we let this \nvirus problem spread, if do not figure out how to stop it. That is \nneeded. I will stand behind it. The record supports the need. I hope \nthe Senate will reject the amendment.\n  Mr. GREGG addressed the Chair.\n\n[[Page S8448]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. I ask for the regular order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The regular order is the Senator's amendment \nnumber 4959.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 4969 to Amendment No. 4959\n\n     (Purpose: To prohibit the use of funds to make loans to large \n processors of sugarcane and sugar beets unless the loans require the \n   processors to repay the full amount of the loans, plus interest.)\n\n  Mr. GREGG. I send an amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from New Hampshire [Mr. Gregg] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 4969 to amendment No. 4959.\n\n  Mr. GREGG. I ask unanimous consent reading of the amendment be \ndispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       Strike all after the word ``SEC.'' and insert the \n     following:\n\n     REPAYMENT OF CERTAIN SUGAR LOANS.\n\n       None of the funds appropriated or otherwise made available \n     by this Act may be used to make a loan to a processor of \n     sugarcane or sugar beets, or both, who has an annual revenue \n     that exceeds $15 million, unless the terms of the loan \n     require the processor to repay the full amount of the loan, \n     plus interest.\n\n  Mr. GREGG. This is the same as the underlying amendment, but it \nchanges the amount that is required of processors to have recourse on \nfrom a $10 million threshold to a $15 million threshold. After that, it \nis a more lenient amendment than the first, if we presume we are \nrequiring people to pay back loans.\n  It does not, I think, aggravate the situation and should not from the \nstandpoint of my colleagues who feel differently on this amendment than \nI do. I offer it to protect my position in the batting order here.\n  I make one additional point. There was a point made on the other \nside, and this is, really, ancillary to the overall debate but needs to \nbe responded to. There was a point made on the other side that the \nSugar Program as presently structured actually causes a net ``infloat'' \nof the Treasury because this is an assessment process. However, if you \ntake into effect in the calculation the cost to the Federal Government \nof having to buy sugar for products which it uses and food stamps and \nmilitary feeding and child nutrition at the inflated rate we must pay \nbecause the Federal Government is a fairly large consumer--also as I \nmentioned, and I suspect ad nauseam for my colleagues, the price here \nis dramatically more than the price the market would be were this a \nmarket-oriented program versus price-control program.\n  GAO has advised us the cost to the Federal Government, by letter of \nJuly 18, the cost in 1994 to the Federal Government for purchasing \nproducts which had inflated prices due to the cost of sugar was \napproximately $90 million annually. So that exceeds, by, I think, a \nfactor of three, what is alleged to be the positive cash flow of this \nprogram to the Treasury.\n  Let me read the operative sentences:\n\n       In 1994, total expenditures on food were approximately $647 \n     billion. Of this amount, approximately $42 billion was \n     government expenditures for food purchases and cash transfers \n     to consumers for food purchases. This represented 6.5 percent \n     of all domestic food expenditures. Applying this to the $1.4 \n     billion cost of the sugar program, we estimate that the \n     government's additional cost of purchasing food and providing \n     the level of food assistance it delivered in 1994, was \n     approximately $90 million.\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent this letter be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                    General Accounting Office,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, July 18, 1995.\n     Congressional Requesters,\n       In our report entitled Sugar Program; Changing Domestic and \n     International Conditions Require Program Changes (GAO/RCED-\n     93-84, Apr. 16, 1993), we estimated that the U.S. sugar \n     program costs sweetener users an average of $1.4 billion \n     annually. In this context, you requested that we estimate how \n     much the sugar program increases the government's costs of \n     purchasing food and conducting food assistance programs.\n       While it is impossible to precisely quantify the direct \n     costs of the sugar program to the government, we have \n     approximated the government's additional costs, based on its \n     share of total domestic food expenditures. In 1994, total \n     expenditures on food were approximately $647 billion. Of this \n     amount, approximately $42 billion was government expenditures \n     for food purchases and cash transfers to consumers for food \n     purchases. This represented 6.5 percent of all domestic food \n     expenditures. Applying this percentage to the $1.4 billion \n     cost of the sugar program, we estimate that the government's \n     additional cost of purchasing food and providing the level of \n     food assistance it delivered in 1994, was approximately $90 \n     million.\n       Table I provides more detail, by program, on the \n     government's expenditures on direct food purchases and cash \n     assistance for consumer food purchases. These calculations \n     are approximated, using the best available information.\n\n  TABLE I.--GOVERNMENT SPENDING ON FOOD PURCHASES AND CASH PAYMENTS FOR \n                      CONSUMER FOOD PURCHASES, 1994                     \n                        [In millions of dollars]                        \n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                           Program                               Amount \n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nFood Stamps..................................................    $22,880\nChild nutrition food subsidies \\1\\...........................      6,262\nDirect distribution to families..............................         46\nThe Emergency Food Assistance Program (TEFAP)................        142\nThe Special Supplemental Food Program for Women, Infants, and           \n Children (WIC)..............................................      2,396\nCommodity supplemental.......................................         84\nDirect distribution to institutions..........................      1,561\nDirect distribution to the elderly...........................        177\nCorrectional institutions \\1\\................................      1,564\nHospitals \\1\\................................................      1,017\nNursing homes \\1\\............................................      2,038\nOther homes and schools \\1\\..................................        266\nMilitary food purchases \\2\\..................................      1,055\nMilitary subsistence payments \\3\\............................      2,401\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nSource: USDA Economic Research Service.                                 \nNote: Data are for calendar year 1994, except where otherwise noted.    \n\\1\\ Includes federal, state, and local spending.                        \n\\2\\ Fiscal year 1994 data provided by the Defense Logistics Agency.     \n\\3\\ Fiscal year data provided by each of the Armed Services.            \n\n       While raising the costs of purchasing food and conducting \n     food assistance programs, the sugar program generates some \n     revenues through marketing assessments on sugar.

Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays on my amendment \nin the second degree.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  They yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4968\n\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, the amendment of the Senator from Arizona \nis arbitrary at best and capricious at worst.\n  The year 1995 culminated a series of cuts in agricultural research \nover a period of years. In other words, agricultural research funds had \nbeen cut every year for several years. In 1995, for the first time in \nthis Nation's history, agricultural yields per acre failed to increase. \nThat was on an apples-and-apples basis, where rainfall and so on was \ntaken into consideration.\n  Now, the suggestion is, and I am not familiar enough with that study \nto know, but the suggestion is that as we have cut agricultural \nresearch money, we are finally being caught up by lower yields of \nagricultural products per acre.\n  When I was a youngster, 15 or 20 bushels of soybeans per acre in much \nof my State was ordinary. Today, even unirrigated beans ought to make \n30 to 40 bushels per acre. Rice, I can remember when 50 to 75 bushels \nof rice per acre was a big crop, and today it is not uncommon, at all, \nin my State, for rice farmers to make 200 bushels of rice per acre.\n  Cotton. When I was a kid, because we did not have any antidote to the \nboll weevil, a half-bale of cotton to the acre was considered a pretty \ngood crop. And everybody knows what Norman Borlaug did for wheat \nproduction in this country. All of those things were not accidental. \nThey were done because the Federal Government put money into \nagricultural research. Right now, the fire ant is moving north. \nSouthern Arkansas is covered with fire ants. They do a tremendous \namount of damage. Killer bees are moving up from Mexico.\n  Mr. President, I am one of the people who think we probably made a \nmistake when we eliminated the honey program. The honey program cost \nvery little. The reason I had real trouble with that amendment is \nbecause bees pollinate plants; 15 percent of all the pollinization in \nthis country is done by native honey bees. The killer bees coming up \nfrom Mexico are killing our bees, and, in addition, there are strains\n\n[[Page S8449]]\n\nof virus and other threats to honey bees that need to be understood. \nThat takes research. Once we understand the problems, solutions will \nfollow.\n  I saw a story the other day that was interesting to me because the \ncranberry farmers of Massachusetts, for example, are getting terribly \nupset because they depend on bee farmers to bring their hives to their \ncrops and pollinate them. I am not sure New Hampshire does not have \nsome crops similar to that, which honeybee farmers bring into New \nHampshire. And now the average life of a beehive has gone from 3 years \nto 1 year. Oh, yes, we spent Federal dollars every year subsidizing the \nhoney industry through research. But I can tell you that is peanuts--if \nyou will pardon the expression--compared to the benefit that honey bees \ndo for the American farmers in pollinating their crops.\n  The Senator from Arizona mentioned aquaculture. Thirty years ago, the \nfarmers of Arkansas started raising catfish, domestically raised \ncatfish. And all the world, if they are not already familiar, should \nknow that it is the most beautiful, delicious, delicate, succulent fish \never known. We went into the catfish farming business almost out of \nnecessity because we irrigate our rice crops and we store the water in \nthe wintertime. The farmers decided that as long as they have these big \nponds of stored water that they use to irrigate rice with, why not \nfigure out another use for those rice irrigating ponds.\n  My predecessor in the U.S. Senate, Bill Fulbright, helped come up \nwith the idea of raising catfish in those ponds. Mr. President, would \nyou like to know how many pounds of catfish we could raise a year per \nacre? Seven-hundred pounds. And so at least we started a couple of \ncatfish research projects called aquaculture--all fish-raising is \naquaculture. We have one in Mississippi and one in Arkansas. In \nArkansas we think continued research is important and 2 years ago we \nmade substantial investments to improve our aquaculture research \nfacilities in Stuttgart. The 1996 farm bill redesignated that facility \nas the National Aquaculture Research Center, and I can tell you we are \nall very proud of it. Some of the magazines called it a $7 million fish \nfarm. It had nothing to do with fish farming beyond its application of \nnew information for fish farmers; it was all research. But over the \nperiod of the last 30 years, because the Federal Government has put \nmoney into fish farming research, catfish farming research, production \nof catfish per acre has gone from 700 pounds per acre per year to 4,400 \npounds per acre per year. And unless we continue to fund agriculture \nresearch, we are going to be sitting around the breakfast table looking \nat each other wondering what we are going to eat that day.\n  On the front page of the Metro section of the Post this morning there \nwas an interesting article concerning blue crab in the Chesapeake Bay? \nThe crop this year is so sparse that 500 crab pickers are out of work. \nAnd the ones who are working are working 3 days a week. Now, if \nsomebody came in here and said they had a beautiful idea for \nreplenishing the crab population of the bay, I might vote for it. I can \nassure you that those employed in the crabbing industry around \nChesapeake Bay and consumers who enjoy reasonably priced crabmeat would \nbe asking us to vote for it.\n  The Senator from Arizona mentioned Children's Hospital in Arkansas. I \ncan remember when the Children's Hospital in Arkansas was just a small \nhospital to treat severely burned children. Today, it is one of the \nfinest state-of-the-art children's hospitals in America. And this is \nthe third year we have put money in that. What is the Department of \nAgriculture doing giving money to the Children's Hospital in Arkansas? \nIt is for a really sophisticated nutrition program. Do you know \nsomething else? The Children's Hospital in Little Rock is putting up a \nlot of money--millions--to build a facility to house this nutrition \nprogram. I never knew what a children's hospital was. A hospital was a \nhospital to me, until my daughter became ill and the pediatrician said, \n``You ought to take her to Boston.'' The finest children's hospital in \nthe world is in Boston, MA. That is where I took her. Today, I would \nnot have to go to Boston because of the tremendous strides of the \nArkansas Children's Hospital.\n  A member of my family left a week ago and went to the emergency room \nof one of the hospitals in Washington, DC, and there were three \nresidents standing there. This new doctor, a young man, walked in. He \nhad just joined Georgetown University Hospital. When he found out I was \nfrom Arkansas, he said, ``You know, when I finished my training and \nstarted looking for a place to settle, believe it or not, I went to \nLittle Rock, AR. I looked over your Children's Hospital, and I never \ngot such a shock in my life. It is one of the finest facilities I have \never been in. I nearly decided to stay in Little Rock, not only because \nof the facilities but because of the quality of the people there.''\n  There is $425,000 in this bill to continue funding what we hope will \nbe one of the finest children's and nutrition programs in the United \nStates. Now, I can remember when it took 9 to 12 weeks to grow a \nbroiler, a chicken, for the retail fresh market. Today, you do it in 6 \nweeks. Do you know why? Because of agriculture research.\n  So I cannot say much more than the chairman has already said. He made \na beautiful speech on the McCain amendment a moment ago. I hope when \nthe time comes that the amendment, which, as I say, is arbitrary at \nbest, will be soundly defeated.\n\n\n                         Privilege of the Floor\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Robert Hedberg, who is \nworking for the Senate Agriculture Committee, be given floor privileges \nduring the debate on this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Gregg). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I rise to simply advise the Senate that \nthe Senator from Massachusetts came over a while ago to ask if he could \nhave 10 minutes as if in morning business to talk about a subject that \nhe discussed in the Senate earlier, and hadn't been able to complete \nhis remarks. I suggested that he come over around 4:30, thinking that \nthere might be a lull in the action so that he could proceed with \nmorning business remarks. But I know the Senator from North Dakota is \nhere to talk about the issue before the Senate. I hope we can resolve \nit so that the Senator from Massachusetts can have a few minutes \nfollowing the Senator from North Dakota, or preceding the Senator, \nwhatever is their pleasure.\n  Mr. CONRAD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4959\n\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, they are at it again. The critics of farm \nprograms are suggesting bad policy for agriculture and are trying to \nbreak the promise just made to the American farmer.\n  On April 4 this year, the President signed into law the 1996 farm \nbill. That is April 4 of this year. The proponents of that bill claim \nthey had a 7-year plan for agriculture, one that promised to be \nreliable, one that promised to provide certainty, one that promised to \nreduce Government interference.\n  The farm bill passed, and now we see how quickly their promises have \nbeen broken. The House Agriculture Appropriations Subcommittee proposed \nadditional cuts in addition to those already made in commodity payments \nunder the freedom to farm legislation. They broke their promise to the \nAmerican farmer--not 7 years later, but 7 weeks later. So much for \nreliability and certainty.\n  Thankfully, those additional cuts in commodity payments were rejected \nat the full committee level. But the critics of the farm program did \nnot stop there. They proposed, on the House side, capping raw sugar \nprices. Imagine, people who advocate market orientation are placing \ninto law a limit on what prices could be in an industry. If that is not \nGovernment interference, I do not know what is.\n  Under that amendment, the Republican-led House would be telling the \nGovernment to reach into the sugar market and place an arbitrary cap on \nprices. It is the ultimate irony--Government interference at its worst. \nOnce again, a promise was broken.\n  Now today we are faced with an amendment to interfere even more with \nwhat was just agreed to months ago. The Gregg amendment eliminates the \nsafety net U.S. producers have\n\n[[Page S8450]]\n\nagainst heavily subsidized foreign competition.\n  The Senator from New Hampshire I think is well-motivated, well-\nintended, but I think sadly misinformed as to international sugar and \nabout what happens in these markets. And I would say to my colleague \nfrom New Hampshire that this is not like Dell Computer, or Apple \nComputer, or IBM. Oh, no, that is not the way the sugar market works in \nthe world. This is not a free market. That is a nice idea--a textbook \nidea--but it is not the real world. The sugar industry worldwide works \nin a much different way. Every major producing country has a program--\nevery one. We are not talking about a free market. We are talking about \nheavy Government involvement in every one of these producing countries.\n  What the Senator from New Hampshire wants to do is say to the U.S. \nindustry, ``You go out there and compete against all these other \ncountries, but without the benefit of a program. You go out there, and \nwe are going to engage in unilateral disarmament here in America.'' We \nare going to say to our folks, ``You go out and compete not only \nagainst other countries' farmers, but against the governments of other \ncountries, and good luck. We hope everything will work out.'' \nEverything will not work out.\n  Anybody who has looked at the sugar industry and what has happened \nknows better, knows precisely what will happen, if we say to our \nproducers, ``You go out there and compete against heavily subsidized \nforeign sugar and see what happens.'' We all know what will happen. Our \nfolks will go broke, because the treasuries of these countries with \nwhom we are competing are a lot bigger than the treasuries of the \nindividual producers.\n  That is the reality of what we face here. This notion that the \nSenator advocates that U.S. sugar policy unfairly inflates U.S. prices \nover world prices is absolutely untrue--absolutely untrue. All of us \nknow what happens if you take away the sugar program. This chart shows \nwhat has happened the two times we eliminated the sugar program. Here \nis what happened to prices. They skyrocketed in both cases in the early \n1970's and in the early 1980's. Prices skyrocketed. Why? Because the \nmarket knew we were headed for turbulence, a lack of certainty, that \npeople would dramatically reduce their plantings. And what would happen \nis you would see shortages, spot shortages. And those who are producers \nof sugar, refiners, bid up the price in order to assure themselves of a \nstable supply. That is what has happened repeatedly.\n  Unfortunately, when my colleague says, ``Gee, look at the price. The \nsugar price is 22 cents a pound, and the world price is 13 cents. Well, \nthere is evidence, there is clear evidence that this sugar program is \ngouging consumers.'' Nonsense, absolute nonsense.\n  Eighty-five percent of the sugar that is marketed in the world moves \nunder contract. This sugar is not in the world market at all. It is \nmoved under a contract. For this reason, the so-called world market is \nnot a world market. It is a dump market. It is where the sugar sells \nthat is not under contract. That is why you see the prices in the so-\ncalled world market, the dump market, selling for 13 cents.\n  Look at what happens if you eliminate the sugar program. We know what \nhappens. Every time it has been tried, prices skyrocket. And who got \nhurt? I will tell you who got hurt. The consumer got hurt. This is not \na free-market model. That is not what is happening in world sugar \nproduction.\n  Make no mistake: The Gregg amendment kills the sugar program. If you \nwant to kill the sugar program, there is a way to do it--pass the Gregg \namendment. If you want to sock it to consumers, pass the Gregg \namendment. Prices will skyrocket. We know, it has happened before \nwhenever somebody actually got a mind to pursue this course. But not \nonly will it hurt consumers, it will hurt American producers, because \neven though prices will go up, American producers will be hurt. Why? \nBecause we will get a flood of foreign sugar into the U.S. market.\n  We know what will happen. It happened every time in the past when \nthis and the other Chamber has decided that we should eliminate the \nsugar program, that we were going to be free from the world and act as \nthough there is some free market in world sugar. There is no free \nmarket.\n  Let me just say that the Gregg amendment is not a program. It is a \nrecipe for disaster. It will force dozens of millers and processors and \nthousands of farmers out of business. This is not some insignificant \namendment.\n  In my State, there are thousands of farmers that depend on sugar for \na substantial part of their income. Kill this program, and you kill \nthem. And they know it. They know exactly what is happening in these \nworld markets. They know exactly what has happened with other \ncountries' programs. They know exactly what we are up against in these \nworld markets.\n  For those less familiar with sugar policy, loans are not made to \nthese producers, because beets and cane are not storable commodities. \nIt is unlike other commodities such as grains, such as corn and wheat. \nThose are programs that have a payment that goes directly to producers \nbecause those are storable commodities.\n  That is not the case in sugar. Sugarcane and sugar beets are not \nstorable. So what we have is a program where the loans are made to the \nmillers and processors who store the raw cane or the processed beet \nsugar. As a result, producers are intricately tied to the millers and \nprocessors. If millers and processors are no longer able to use the \nloan program, they will simply go out of business and they will take \nfarmers with them, make no mistake.\n  Let us just look at how many beet processors and cane mills have \nalready gone out of business. This chart clearly shows that this \nindustry is already facing hard times. This shows what has happened to \nbeet and cane processing mills that have gone out of business since \n1990. If anybody thinks there is some big windfall out here, somebody \nis getting rich on this program, let us look at the record.\n  Why did all these folks go out of business if it is so good? Let us \nlook at beet and cane processing mills. This is just since 1990. The \nrecord since 1980 is a whole lot darker.\n  Let us just look since 1990. Delta Sugar Co., beet plant, California, \nwent under in 1993; Holly Sugar, California, beet plant, 1993; Columbia \nSugar, cane plant, went out of business, Louisiana, 1994; Hamakua \nSugar, cane plant, Hawaii, 1994; Hilo Coast Processing, again, cane \nsugar, went out of business in 1994; Oahu Sugar, cane plant, Hawaii, \n1994; Spreckels Sugar, again, a California plant--this is a beet \nplant--went out of business in 1996; Holly Sugar, Hamilton City, CA, \nbeet plant, went out of business in 1996; Ka'u Agribusiness Co., cane \nplant, Hawaii, 1996, went out of business; Kaialua Sugar Co., cane \nplant, Hawaii, 1996, went out of business; McBryde Sugar, cane plant, \nHawaii, went out of business in 1996; Western Sugar, Mitchell, NE, beet \nplant, went out of business in 1996.\n  One after another, right out of business, and you pass the Gregg \namendment and we will be able to provide next year chart after chart \nafter chart just like this one of companies that have gone out of \nbusiness. That is what we are talking about. The stakes are high.\n  Let me be clear. The Gregg amendment benefits the sugar refiners. \nThat is who is the beneficiary if this amendment passes, not consumers. \nThey will not benefit. In fact, they will be hurt. Not farmers, not \nbeet processors, not cane mills, but refiners, they will be the \nbeneficiaries.\n  Let us look at charts that show the efforts made to increase the \nsupply of raw sugar in the U.S. market and the activity it caused in \nthe market. This chart shows what we have seen with respect to raw \nsugar prices and the import quota increases over the past year and a \nhalf as USDA allowed quota increases four consecutive times, all to the \nbenefit of refiners.\n  This chart shows raw sugar prices from 1995 to 1996. On November 9, \n1995, USDA allowed another 330,000 tons to come in over quota--that is, \nforeign sugar to come into the United States--and look what happened to \nprices. Prices went down markedly. Then they came back up. January 17 \nof this year they socked it to the domestic producer again bringing in \nmore foreign sugar and predictably prices plunged again. Then we saw \nprice recovery. All of this is moving in the 22\\1/2\\ to 23 cents a \npound range.\n  On April 1, they did it again, brought in another 220,000 tons from \nabroad.\n\n[[Page S8451]]\n\n Prices plunged. And again, June 12, just a month ago, another 165,000 \ntons. Look what happened to prices; a steep decline as more foreign \nsugar was brought in, that benefited whom? Benefited the refiners \nbecause they were getting more sugar to process through their plants, \nmore throughput, more activity, more profit.\n  I do not begrudge them and their profit. But let us look at what is \nhappening with respect to the throughput of the refiners, because the \nGregg amendment is misnamed. It ought to be called the ``refiners \nbenefit bill.'' That is really what we are talking about. You are \npicking sides in an economic fight and you are saying we want to give \nthe refiners more than they are getting now.\n  Let us look at what the throughput has been through cane refiners' \nplants in the last 10 years--1985-86 to 1995-96.\n  Back in 1986-87, we were looking at 5.3 million short tons. Had a bad \nyear in 1987-88. Then we went to 5.4 million short tons. Went up to 5.9 \nmillion--that is the peak--in 1990-91. Then we saw some pulling back. \nBut in 1995-96 we see a record for the refiners in terms of throughput, \n6.4 million short tons--6.4 million short tons. And yet what do we have \nbefore us? The refiners benefit bill. They have just had record \nthroughput. That is the amount of product going through their plants. \nThey just had a record year.\n  Well, throughput alone does not tell you what the refiners are \nexperiencing. You have to look at the difference between the raw sugar \nprice and the refined sugar price. That will tell you, combined with \nthroughput, how well our refiner friends are doing.\n  What do we find when we look at that? Well, it is very, very \ninteresting--very interesting, indeed. This chart shows from 1990 to \n1996 raw sugar prices. That is in red. I hope there is nothing in the \nway of their seeing exactly what has happened to raw sugar prices.\n  They have been stable for 10 years. This awful program that is \ngouging consumers has provided them with stable prices for 10 years. \nName anything else that people buy in this country that has been stable \nfor 10 years. Tell me one thing that has been stable for 10 years. But \nsugar prices, raw sugar prices have been stable. I wish I could say the \nsame thing for refined sugar because refined sugar, you can see, \nstarting in 1995, took off like a scalded cat. Refined sugar prices \njumped, and jumped dramatically at the same time raw sugar prices were \nfalling. Raw sugar prices were falling; refined sugar prices were \nskyrocketing. I have already shown you the record throughput for \nrefiners in 1995-96. And yet what we have before us is a refiners \nbenefit bill. That is the Gregg amendment.\n  Why should we be passing a refiners benefit bill when they have just \nhad the biggest throughput in their history and, No. 2, the best \nmargins--the best margins--that you can find in the last 10 years?\n  Mr. President, what has happened, I believe, is very clear. This is a \ntransparent argument. The refiners want to continue to make more money \nby refining cheap sugar from the world market. This amendment not only \nbreaks the promises of reliability, certainty, and reduced Government \ninterference in agriculture that was made to American farmers only 4 \nmonths ago, but it is bad policy that would send shock waves through a \ndomestic industry, a domestic industry that produces tens of thousands \nof jobs in this country.\n  I hope my colleagues will join me in soundly rejecting the Gregg \namendment.\n  Let me just conclude by saying this is, again, not like the typical \nindustry. Senator Gregg refers to the computer industry, and says there \nis no Government involvement there. He is right. That is a whole \ndifferent ball game than the worldwide sugar industry, where every \nsingle major producing country has a program. Every single one of them \naggressively supports their producers. If we are to abandon ours, the \nresults will be very, very clear.\n  No. 1, we have seen what has happened in the past in terms of prices. \nPrices will skyrocket. That is undeniable. The world price the Senator \nrefers to as 15 percent of the market is a dump market. It has no \nrelationship to supply/demand relations in the world. The vast majority \nof sugar moves under contract in the world. So that dump market and its \nso-called world price is not a world price at all, it is a dump price. \nThat is what people get for sugar produced above and beyond their \ncontractual requirements. If you take away the program you are going to \nget exactly what we saw the last two times: Prices skyrocket. So \nconsumers are not going to be helped, they are going to be hurt.\n  No. 2, the processors in this country, beet processors and cane \nprocessors, are going to be hurt. I have already shown all the plants \nthat have closed in 1994, 1995, and 1996. A lot of plants have closed. \nOnly one refiner but a lot of processing plants have closed. So those \nfolks would be hurt. When they are hurt the farmers are hurt because \nthe farmers are directly tied with those processing facilities. All of \na sudden, if you yank out from U.S. producers any support, what you \nhave done is changed the balance of power in these world markets.\n  Who have you helped? You have helped our foreign competitors. The \nGregg amendment is great if you represent a foreign country and you \nproduce sugar. They would look forward to the day the United States \npulls the plug on its producers and its processors. They are just \nwaiting for the opportunity to come in and take over this industry, \ntake the jobs, take the economic growth, and take the economic \nopportunity.\n  American farmers who produce sugar are the most efficient in the \nworld. We are ready to compete head to head with anybody at any time. \nBut what our producers are not prepared to do is to take on not only \nthe farmers of another country but the governments of other countries. \nThat is not a fair fight. And our Government should not abandon our \nproducers and our processors, helping foreign governments, foreign \nproducers, foreign processors against the refiners of this country. \nThat is what this amendment is really about. I hope this Chamber will \ndo as it has done before and reject the Gregg amendment and reject it \nin a resounding way.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KENNEDY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/07/22/senate-section/article/S8426-1", "month": "07", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "22", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8451-S8454]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n PERSONAL RESPONSIBILITY, WORK OPPORTUNITY, AND MEDICAID RESTRUCTURING \n                              ACT OF 1996\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I thank my colleagues, our managers, for \nindicating when might be an appropriate time to speak on an issue, the \nunderlying issue, which is welfare reform in a way not to interfere \nwith debate on the agricultural appropriations bill. I will take that \nopportunity now, to speak on this underlying measure, which the Senate \nwill address tomorrow.\n  There will be a series of amendments. I offered amendments dealing \nwith the children of legal immigrants and also to provide, if we are \ngoing to go into these rather draconian measures in cutting off help \nand assistance to these children, to another amendment, which has been \ndescribed in the Record earlier today, to help and assist the local \ncounties and communities where they are going to have a particular \nburden, trying to implement the provisions to terminate help, \nassistance to poor children.\n  I have a fuller explanation on that. I will not take the time of the \nSenate on those measures, which are more fully explained in the Record \nearlier today. I will address the overall issue which is before us, and \nthat is the proposal placed on the Senate agenda, which we will vote on \ntomorrow, under the title of the welfare reform.\n  Mr. President, in putting forward this legislation, I believe the \nRepublican majority is asking us to codify extremism and call it \nvirtue. Their plan will condemn millions of American children to \npoverty as the price for the misguided Republican revolution. If \nchildren could vote, this Republican plan to slash welfare would be as \ndead as the Republican plan to slash Medicare. In fact, the driving \nforce behind this attack on children is not welfare reform at all. It \nis the desperate Republican need to find some way, any way, to pay for \ntheir tax breaks for wealthy.\n  Honest welfare reform is long overdue. The current system is broken. \nMajor change is needed. I support honest reforms that end welfare as a \nway\n\n[[Page S8452]]\n\nof life and make it a waystation to work. But honest reform does not \nproduce anywhere near the massive savings needed to pay for the \nRepublican tax breaks. Child care costs money. Job training and \neducation cost money. And our Republican friends have absolutely no \ninterest in real reform if it costs money.\n  The proposal before us is not welfare reform. It is nothing more than \nlegislative snake oil, and it is the wrong medicine for what ails us as \na Nation. Real welfare reform is about protecting children and putting \npeople to work, not putting on a show. But that is what this is--\ntheater, pure and simple; a glaring and callous example of just how low \nthe Republican majority will go, even if it comes at the expense of \nmillions of American children.\n  For the Republican majority, this bill may be child's play, but they \nare playing with real children's lives and real children's futures. \nThis bad bill is Robin Hood in reverse, robbing poor children to pay \nfor tax breaks for rich Republicans.\n  Since the Republican takeover of Congress, our colleagues have \nbrought us many poison pills wrapped in the rhetoric of reform. But \nthis may well be the most cruel and extreme measure of the entire \nRepublican revolution--because it inflicts so much harm on so many \nchildren. In fact, it pushes back 60 years of social progress.\n  In 1935, Congress made a bold pledge to the elderly and the children \nof our communities that this rich Nation would not let them sink into \npoverty. It was a sign of what we stood for as a nation. Republicans \nmay consider destroying this covenant as a virtue--but Bishop Weakland \nof Milwaukee has called it ``a moral blemish on the Earth's most \naffluent society.'' I could not agree more.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have the Bishop's full statement printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the statement was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the Washington Post, July 4, 1996]\n\n                  Wisconsin Works: Breaking a Covenant\n\n                     (By Rembert G. Weakland, OSB)\n\n       Catholics in Wisconsin have been in the trenches serving \n     the needy since the Daughters of Charity began their work \n     with the poor of Milwaukee in 1843. I and my family relied on \n     welfare to survive in the 1930s. So it comes naturally for me \n     to consider the implications of Wisconsin's proposal for \n     welfare reform, known as Wisconsin Works or ``W-2.''\n       Certainly the Catholic bishops and others in the church who \n     grapple with the needs of the poor agree that the current \n     welfare system is in need of major reform. Both the U.S. \n     Catholic Conference and the Wisconsin Catholic Conference \n     have said so. Both have challenged the status quo. Both have \n     offered constructive proposals for helping the poor more \n     effectively.\n       Yet as I reflect on the W-2 proposal in light of my \n     experience and the tenets of Catholic social teaching, I \n     remain convinced of the need for the community to guarantee a \n     ``safety net'' for the poor, especially children. \n     Accordingly, though the W-2 proposal has merit in important \n     respects, it would be a mistake for the president and \n     Congress to embrace comprehensive legislation or requests \n     from individual states, even my own, that withdraw this \n     guarantee.\n       Catholic social teaching holds that the poor, especially \n     children, have a moral claim on the resources of the \n     community to secure the necessities of life. For more than 60 \n     years, our society has recognized this claim with a covenant \n     that ensures a minimal level of assistance for food, clothing \n     and shelter to poor children and their families. Millions of \n     children have relied on that covenant since the 1930s. In \n     Wisconsin, more than 120,000 children rely on Aid to Families \n     With Dependent Children (AFDC) today.\n       People of goodwill can argue over the need to modify AFDC \n     so it better serves that purpose. But it is patently unjust \n     for a society as affluent as ours to nullify that covenant.\n       Unfortunately, as enacted, the Wisconsin Works program does \n     just that. The enabling statute for the W-2 proposal \n     specifically states no one is entitled to W-2 services, even \n     who are eligible to receive them.\n       It is one thing to change the rules of the welfare system. \n     It is quite another thing to say, ``Even if you play by the \n     new rules, society will not help you.'' This is not welfare \n     reform but welfare repeal. Such a message may be politically \n     attractive in this election year; it is not morally \n     justifiable.\n       Even if one accepts the premise that the W-2 program offers \n     poor families help in return for work, this premise collapses \n     if the help is not provided. The president and Congress must \n     insist that W-2, indeed any welfare reform proposal, serve \n     all who are eligible.\n       Critics of the welfare system allege that public assistance \n     undermines personal responsibility. This generalizes about \n     poor families when we should strive to take a more personal \n     view.\n       In the first place, the children of the poor did not choose \n     their families. We should not afflict these children with \n     hunger in order to infuse their parents with virtue.\n       Additionally, we cannot judge a person's failure to work in \n     isolation from larger forces. My experience from our work \n     with the U.S. bishops' pastoral letter on economic justice \n     impressed on me the truth that poor families are especially \n     vulnerable to economic downturns triggered by national or \n     international events.\n       Nor can prosperous states ensure full employment. Even in \n     states, like Wisconsin, that enjoy healthy economies and \n     relatively low employment, not all who want to work can earn \n     a family wage. So long as this is the case, it is unwise and \n     unjust for the federal government to abandon its commitment \n     to the poor. Our covenant with needy children must remain the \n     responsibility of the entire American family.\n       Moreover, this critique of welfare ignores the fact that \n     rights and responsibilities are not mutually exclusive but \n     complementary. In the context of welfare policy, a right to \n     work is grounded in a responsibility to support a family. \n     This is relevant when assessing another aspect of W-2.\n       According to our state's own projections, 75 percent of the \n     families now on AFDC will be assigned to W-2 work slots that \n     provide less than a full-time worker earns at the minimum \n     wage. Accordingly, the responsibility of these parents to \n     care for their children must be supported when necessary by a \n     safety net adequate to meet the family's basic needs.\n       Finally, the president and Congress must recognize that \n     they cannot repeal the assurance of public assistance in \n     Wisconsin without making it a national policy. Once such a \n     repeal is granted to a single state, others will seek similar \n     license. The poor will lose their safety net by degrees as \n     surely as if Congress and the president repealed it all at \n     once. Such an outcome would be a tragedy for the poor and a \n     moral blemish on the earth's most affluent society.\n       One can appreciate the burden of difficult choices in an \n     election year.\n       Nonetheless, the short-term political outlook of the \n     candidate must not cloud the moral vision of the leader. \n     America's 60-year covenant with its poor children and those \n     who nurture them must remain unbroken.\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, let me just mention a few points:\n  For more than 60 years, our society has recognized this claim with a \ncovenant that ensures a minimal level of assistance for food, clothing, \nand shelter for poor children and their families. Millions of children \nhave relied on that covenant since the 1930's. In Wisconsin, more than \n120,000 children rely on aid to families with dependent children today.\n\n       People of good will can argue over the need to modify AFDC \n     so it better serves that purpose. But it is patently unjust \n     for a society as affluent as ours to nullify that covenant.\n\n  And that is what this measure does.\n\n       In the first place, the children of the poor did not choose \n     their families. We should not afflict these children with \n     hunger in order to infuse their parents with virtue.\n\n  And then he continues:\n\n       Even in States like Wisconsin which enjoy healthy economies \n     and relatively low unemployment, not all who want to work can \n     earn a family wage. So long as this is the case, it is unwise \n     and unjust for the Federal Government to abandon its \n     commitment to the poor. Our covenant with the needy children \n     must remain the responsibility of the entire American family.\n\n  And the last full paragraph:\n\n       One can appreciate the burden of difficult choices in an \n     election year. Nonetheless, the short-term political outlook \n     of the candidate must not cloud the moral vision of the \n     leader. America's 60-year-old covenant with its poor children \n     and those who nurture them must remain unbroken.\n\n  Mr. President, I divert for a moment to two other articles that have \nbeen quoted to some extent during the course of the debate on this \nwelfare reform: George Will's article about ``Women and Children \nFirst?'' I quote a paragraph:\n\n       Furthermore, there is hardly an individual or industry in \n     America that is not in some sense ``in the wagon,'' receiving \n     some Federal subvention. If everyone gets out, the wagon may \n     rocket along. But no one is proposing that. Instead, welfare \n     reform may give a whole new meaning to the phrase ``women and \n     children first.''\n\n  Effectively, what is included in this, women and children first, they \nare the ones whose interests end up on the chopping blocks. When most \nthink of the women and children first, every young student who has read \nthrough history probably thinks of the Titanic, where women and \nchildren were first. Mr. Will's excellent article and commentary on \nthis welfare debate suggests, I believe, that the women and children \nfirst will have an entirely new and different meaning.\n  Then today there is in the New York Times an article by David \nEllwood,\n\n[[Page S8453]]\n\nwho has been a very thoughtful both commentator and policymaker on the \nissues of welfare reform and has written extensively about it. Those \nwho have had the opportunity to hear him or listen to him testify can \nattest to his strong commitment to altering and changing the current \nsystem and trying to find ways to do it effectively, and also to \nprotect the interests of the most vulnerable in our society.\n  He points out in his excellent article in the Times today, Monday, \nJuly 22, ``Welfare Reform in Name Only'':\n\n       States would get block grants to use for welfare and work \n     programs. But the grants for child care, job training, \n     workfare, cash assistance combined would amount to less than \n     $15 per poor child per week in poor Southern States, like \n     Mississippi and Arkansas. Moving people from welfare to work \n     is hard. On $15 a week--whom are we kidding?\n\n  As the article points out, on $15 a week, you are talking about \nproviding the basic elements of life: roof over the head of the child, \nclothes for the child, food for the child, as well as for the training \nof the child, child care for the child--for $15 a week. We see other \nexamples.\n  Instead of 88 cents per meal, it will be down to 66 cents per meal \nper child. Mr. President, $26 billion will be taken out of nutrition \nprograms for children and put on to the other side of the ledger for \ntax benefits and breaks for wealthy individuals. It makes no sense.\n  Mr. President, nearly 14 million poor children live in America. Each \nnight, 100,000 of them sleep on the streets, scared and homeless. Their \nfaces are pressed against the windows of our glitter and affluence, and \nCongress is about to pull down the shade.\n  It may be fashionable in some quarters these days to demonize \nfamilies on welfare, to pretend that poor people are lazy and don't \ncare about their children.\n  Listen to just one story I heard recently from a middle-class \nsuburban woman. She tried hard to keep the family together, but she \nfinally fled when her husband badly beat her and her son, and smashing \na chair over her son's head, repeatedly kicking him in the ribs and in \nthe face. She left everything behind.\n  She and her son fled to her parents' home, but the husband found them \nthere. She tried to work, but her husband always found her, threatening \nboth her and her employers. She and her son finally took refuge in a \nshelter. With no other choice, she turned to AFDC. As she told me:\n\n       The support I received from AFDC enabled me to get out, \n     move on to heal myself and my son, and create a new life. It \n     cost the Government a little over $400 a month for 6 months--\n     less than the cost of a modest funeral. Investing in family \n     safety and support seems like the kind of investment this \n     country should protect. Cutting off this lifeline means that \n     the futures of our children are definitely at stake. Let me \n     tell you in all seriousness, these cuts are deadly.\n\n  It is true that some cuts never heal, and these cuts, I believe, in \nthis measure are deadly: Close to $60 billion in harsh, extreme, and \nunjustifiable cuts over the next 6 years.\n  The reality is that this Nation's safety net is fragile and fraying. \nThe Republican response is to rip even more holes in the safety net and \nrequire millions more children to fend for themselves. No terrorist \ncould possibly do so much harm to our country.\n  Nearly half of the Republican savings are from the Food Stamp \nProgram--$28 billion in cuts, affecting 14 million children. By the \nyear 2002, the Republican proposal would provide poor children in \nAmerica only 65 cents a meal, just about enough to buy a soft drink.\n  We know that hungry children are more susceptible to sickness and \nearly death. We know that malnutrition retards growth and delays brain \ndevelopment.\n  We just had, a year ago, the publication of the Carnegie Commission \ntalking about what happens to a child's brain during the early \nformative years unless there is sufficient nutrition benefits to that \nchild. It slows their whole ability to achieve academically and \nemotionally, and it works to their long-term disadvantage.\n  In short, hungry children can't learn. They are twice as likely to be \nabsent from school and four times as likely to be unable to study.\n  The Republican revolution says, ``Let them eat cake.'' I say it's the \nwrong priority for Congress and the wrong priority for America.\n  Our colleagues attempt to justify this outrage by claiming food \nstamps are fraught with waste, fraud, and abuse, but the Republican \nplan has virtually nothing to do with ending the abuses. That is the \ninteresting point. They make the case we ought to cut back this program \nbecause there is abuse and fraud in these programs. But 70 percent of \nthe cuts come directly at programs aimed at families with children. \nOnly 2 percent of the cuts are aimed at waste, fraud, and abuse.\n  The real fraud, waste, and abuse is the scheme to take food from the \nmouths of children in the guise of welfare reform. The Republican plan \nalso targets children's health care. To be sure, the Republican \nleadership bowed to the inevitable and dropped their draconian Medicaid \nprovisions from this bill to avoid a certain Presidential veto. But \nthis bill still jeopardizes health care for millions of mothers and \nchildren.\n  We know under Medicaid, 18 million children receive Medicaid and \nabout 75 percent of those children's parents are working--playing by \nthe rules and working. Under the program that was proposed, you would \nhave seen anywhere from 5 to 8 million of those children completely \ndropped from Medicaid if that had moved forward. What we are talking \nabout now is the alleged welfare reform provisions.\n  Women will not get the prenatal care they need under this particular \nprogram. The 4 million women included would have coverage under this \nprogram. They will not get the prenatal care they need. Adolescents \nwill not get the help to avoid pregnancy and stay in school. Injuries \nand preventable illnesses will now become life-threatening, for \nexample, when they could have been easily treated. Sick children can't \nlearn, and sick parents can't work.\n  Children with disabilities are also attacked under the proposal. Mr. \nPresident, 300,000 children with serious disabilities--mental \nretardation, tuberculosis, autism, head injuries, arthritis--would lose \nthe direct guaranteed assistance that they have under the Supplemental \nSecurity Income Program.\n  When Democratic Senators proposed that States be required, or at \nleast given the option, of offering vouchers after the time limit to \nprovide children with necessities, such as diapers, clothes, cribs, \nmedicine and school supplies, the Republicans said a resounding no. \nWhy? Because ``enough is enough,'' they say. ``It's time to go cold \nturkey,'' they say, even if this bill is the real turkey.\n  Enough is enough. Enough of the back-room deals with high-paid \ncorporate lobbyists. Enough of dismantling commitments to children and \nfamilies who desperately need help. Enough of cruelty called charity.\n  Even when Democrats asked for a look back provision--to provide help \nif the worst predictions materialize and this bill actually becomes the \ndisaster we predict for children--the Republican majority said, ``stop \noverreacting''. To them I say, tell that to the countless families who \nare looking for a chance not a check--a chance for their children to \nreach for the American dream.\n  Stripped down--this is the Republican plan they call welfare reform--\nno resources, no guarantees, no vouchers, no look back, no regrets. It \ndoes not get much more extreme than that.\n  As George Will said in his article,\n\n       No child in America asked to be here. Each was summoned \n     into existence by the acts of adults. And no child is going \n     to be spiritually improved by being collateral damage in a \n     bombardment of severities targeted at adults who may or may \n     not deserve more severe treatment.\n\n  The comments I am making this evening, Mr. President, are from Mr. \nGeorge Will, David Ellwood, and Biship Weakland, who has been one of \nthe most thoughtful of the bishops in terms of children's interests and \nchildren's rights. They all have reached the same conclusion, Mr. \nPresident, about this measure in terms of its harshness and its retreat \nfrom a fundamental sense of decency and caring for the neediest in our \nsociety, and that is poor children in our society.\n  But the Republican majority tells us not to worry. They say the \nwelfare miracles of Wisconsin and Michigan demonstrate that block \ngrants and deep cuts really work. But the facts show this is far from \nthe truth.\n  It takes money to reform welfare. In Wisconsin, after major changes \nin the\n\n[[Page S8454]]\n\nState welfare program, administrative costs rose 72 percent. Wisconsin \nGovernor Thompson himself said that for welfare reform to be \nsuccessful, ``It will cost more up front to transfer the welfare system \nthan many expect.''\n  For welfare reform to succeed, it also takes jobs. Wisconsin and \nMichigan learned this lesson the hard way. In Wisconsin, a trucking \ncompany praised by Governor Thompson and Presidential candidate Bob \nDole for hiring welfare recipients, laid off 45 employees this week, \nincluding the welfare workers. It was a business slowdown they said.\n  In Michigan, only one-fifth of former general relief recipients have \nfound jobs. The majority of beneficiaries have become even more \ndestitute.\n  So it goes when social experiments go wrong. The Republican majority \nis prepared to push welfare families off the cliff in the hope that \nthey'll learn to fly. And what happens if they fall? Nearly 9 million \nchildren, who make up the majority of AFDC recipients, will pay the \nprice. Nine million children, and the majority of AFDC recipients will \npay the price. And as a society, so will we.\n  This is not just theory--the Congressional Budget Office agrees. They \nrecently issued a preliminary assessment of the Republican legislation. \nAnd like last year, they said it will not work. According to their \nstudy, most States will not even attempt to implement the legislation's \nwork requirements, because putting people to work is too expensive. In \nfact, the report says States will fall $13 billion short of the mark, \nand simply throw up their hands.\n  Nevertheless, the Republicans continue to defy the facts.\n  We have had, as I mentioned, church leaders, conservative columnists, \nthose who have spoken and written about the various welfare reform \nprograms with extraordinary credibility--the Congressional Budget \nOffice taking the particular relevant facts--all reaching the same \nconclusion, that this is going to be an extraordinary disaster in its \nimpact on poor children. Like last year, they said it will not work. \nNevertheless, the majority continues to defy the facts.\n  They insist that this legislation is about putting people to work. \nTrust us, they say. That is not acceptable.\n  As Catholic Charities USA said in a recent letter: ``The welfare \nproposal reflects ignorance and prejudice far more than the experience \nof this nation's poorest working and welfare families.''\n  In the final analysis, that is what this legislation is about--\nignorance and prejudice. The American people know that pulling the rug \nout from under struggling families is wrong. Denying health care for \nsick or disabled children is wrong. Keeping families trapped in poverty \nand violence is wrong. Condemning homeless children to cold grates is \nwrong.\n  Perhaps the greatest irony of all is now on display, as America hosts \nthe Olympic Games. We justifiably take pride in being the best in a \nvariety of different events. We may well win a fist full of golds in \nAtlanta, but America is not winning any medals when it comes to caring \nfor our children.\n  The United States has more children living in poverty and spends less \nof its wealth on children than 16 out of the 18 industrial countries in \nthe world. The United States has a larger gap between rich and poor \nchildren than any other industrial nation in the world. Children in the \nUnited States are 1.6 times more likely to be poor than Canadian \nchildren, 2 times more likely to be poor than British children, and 3 \ntimes more likely to be poor than French or German children.\n  When it comes to our children, America should go for the gold.\n  Mr. President, not that just assigning resources, money, on this is \nnecessarily the answer to all the problems. But it is a pretty good \nreflection of where the Nation's priorities are. When the bell tolls \ntomorrow afternoon on that measure that is going to cut back $27 \nbillion out of children's feeding programs, to move that payment from \n88 cents to 65 cents, that is going to be a really clear indication \nabout where the majority believes this Nation's priorities are--to use \nthose savings for tax breaks for the wealthy individuals of this \ncountry. That is wrong. We should all take some time to think about \nwhat kind of country we want and about what we are doing to children, \nto ourselves and the Nation. Surely we can do better than this bad \nbill.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor. I see our two floor managers. I \nappreciate their courtesy.\n  Mr. COCHRAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/07/22/senate-section/article/S8451-1", "month": "07", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "22", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8454-S8465]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   AGRICULTURE, RURAL DEVELOPMENT, FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION, AND \n        RELATED AGENCIES APPROPRIATIONS ACT FOR FISCAL YEAR 1997\n\n  The Senate continued with the consideration of the bill.\n\n\n               current efforts to protect salmon habitat\n\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, I rise to take note and compliment the \nNatural Resources Conservation Service's current efforts to encourage \nand provide technical assistance to private landowners who have salmon \nhabitat on their property. In coordination with the Northwest Power \nPlanning Council's plan for fish and wildlife protection, and other \nFederal agencies, the NRCS is working with conservation districts \nacross Idaho, Oregon and Washington to assist local property owners on \nbasin-wide and watershed specific plans to protect and restore habitat \nfor dwindling runs for coho salmon, steelhead, sea-run cutthroat, and \nmany chinook salmon runs.\n  These efforts have been widely popular in my home State, in \nparticular in the Clearwater and Lemhi Valleys where local landowners \nappreciate having the support to take the initiative to preserve this \nimportant cultural and economic resource. Conservation districts have \nproven to be a most effective method to successfully involve all \nimportant local stakeholders in a mutually acceptable way.\n  Mr. President, it is my intention to commit the Senate to exploring \nin future legislation the ways in which we might better foster this \ngrowing partnership. Would the chairman of the subcommittee agree that \nthis is the sort of incentive approach that merits further \nconsideration?\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, the committee agrees that this is the \nsort of cooperative, incentive-based relationship that should be \nfostered in order to protect natural resources, as is the goal of the \nNatural Resources Conservation Service.\n\n\n                       yellowstar thistle control\n\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, I rise to clarify this Congress' \ncommitment to research that will develop controls for noxious weeds \nthat are problems across this country. In particular, I would like to \nhighlight research being done with the Agricultural Research Service to \ncontrol yellowstar thistle.\n  Yellowstar thistle is a problem across the West. Over 5 million acres \nacross the western United States are currently infested with this \nnoxious weed. Scientists at the University of Idaho tell me that it \ncosts an average of $1 per acre in lost production and costs to control \nthis weed. It doesn't take a rocket scientist to figure out that we're \ntalking about $5 million lost annually across the West.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I concur with the remarks of Senator \nKempthorne. In addition, I understand that, currently, it is nearly \nimpossible to eradicate yellowstar thistle once it has infected the \nnarrow, arid canyon lands of the West, and in particular, the canyons \nof the Clearwater, Snake and Salmon Rivers of my home State.\n  Mr. President, it is my understanding that the research to control \nthis weed is reaching a critical stage, where practical biological \ncontrols should be available for public use within the next few years. \nIs it the intention of this bill to fund research with direct and \nimmediate practical applications for the agricultural industry?\n  Mr. COCHRAN. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. I also noted that the committee specifically directed \nthe ARS to continue funding the Albany, CA yellowstar thistle \ninitiative. Is it the intention of the committee that the ARS continue \ncurrent yellowstar thistle research contracts associated with that \nprogram, including the research efforts with the University of Idaho?\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Yes, it is.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Mr. President, I would like to engage in a colloquy \nwith\n\n[[Page S8455]]\n\nthe distinguished chairman of the subcommittee to clarify the intent of \nlanguage included in the committee report providing funding for ongoing \nresearch at the Plant Materials Center [PMC] in Golden Meadow, \nLouisiana, in collaboration with the Crowley Rice Research Station in \nCrowley, LA; ongoing research on nutria-resistant plant varieties; and \nfunding to test application technologies for recently developed \nartificial seed for cord grass used to prevent coastal erosion. It is \nmy understanding that it was the committee's intent, in the committee \nreport, to continue the work at the Golden Meadow Plant Materials \nCenter, in collaboration with the Crowley Rice Research Station, on \nsmooth cord grass at the fiscal year 1996 level. In addition, work \nunderway at Crowley on the development of nutria-resistant materials \nwould also continue at the fiscal year 1996 level. Finally, it is also \nmy understanding that the $100,000 mentioned in the committee report to \ntest application technologies for smooth cord grass seed would be in \naddition to the funding provided to maintain this ongoing work. Is that \nthe chairman's understanding as well?\n  Mr. COCHRAN. I appreciate the questions of the distinguished Senator \nfrom Louisiana, and I am happy to provide further clarification. The \nSenator is correct in his description of the committee's intent in its \nreport accompanying the bill.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. I appreciate this clarification.\n\n\n  ars funding for integrated low-input crop and livestock production \n               systems at university of wisconsin-madison\n\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I am pleased that funding is provided \nthrough this bill for the ARS Integrated Farming Systems Program, to \npursue long-term research on farming systems that integrate livestock \nand resource enhancing crop rotations--all aimed at answering farmers \nurgent questions of how to be profitable and farm in environmentally \nresponsible ways. This new initiative, as requested by the President's \nfiscal year 1997 budget, recognizes expertise in the farming community \nby building research partnership teams with State researchers, \nextension agents, farmers, and nongovernmental organizations.\n  In this regard, Wisconsin has a nationally recognized program, the \nWisconsin Integrated cropping systems trial, with long-term research \ntrials and an excellent team of farmers, researchers, extension and \nnongovernmental groups collaborating to address questions that go right \nto the heart of the future of farming in the Midwest.\n  As specified in the committee report accompanying this bill, $500,000 \nhas been included in this bill to support research through the ARS/IFS \nProgram into integrated low-input crop and livestock production \nsystems, to be carried out at the Wisconsin-Madison Experiment Station. \nIt is my intent and understanding that this funding is to support the \nWisconsin Integrated cropping systems trial. I would ask the Senator \nfrom Mississippi, the chairman of the Agriculture Appropriations \nSubcommittee, if he would concur with me on this matter.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. I would say to the Senator from Wisconsin that I agree \nwith his comments regarding the ARS/IFS funds provided for the \nWisconsin-Madison Experiment Station.\n  Mr. LEAHY. More than $1 billion a year in Federal funds is saved by \nWIC infant formula cost containment allowing over 1.6 million more \nwomen, infants and children to receive WIC benefits than would \notherwise have been the case. One of the most important factors in the \nsuccess of the WIC cost containment is competition. Until recently \nthere were four infant formula manufacturers in the United States. In \nJanuary, one of the four, Wyeth Laboratories announced its withdrawal \nfrom the domestic market. Now, alarmingly, a move is beginning among \nStates to alter their competitive bidding procedures in a way that \nrestricts competition and makes it impossible for Carnation to compete. \nIf this third small company, Carnation, can't compete, it ultimately \ncould follow Wyeth out of the market. If that occurs, only the two \nlargest manufacturers, Ross and Mead Johnson will remain, and the \nprospects for sustaining large savings will be bleak. Without a third \ncompany seeking to increase market share by winning WIC contracts, cost \ncontainment is not sustainable.\n  In the past, States typically have awarded their WIC contract to the \ncompany whose net wholesale price--the wholesale price minus the rebate \nper can the company offers to pay the state WIC Program--is the lowest. \nBut recently, a few states instead awarded their contracts to the \ncompany that offered the highest rebate per can, regardless of the \ncompany's wholesale price.\n  There is one circumstance where a State may have a legitimate case \nfor awarding a WIC contract on the basis of the highest rebate rather \nthan on the basis of the lowest net wholesale price. This occurs in \nStates where retailers charge about the same price for all formula \nbrands and take a much larger mark-up for Carnation products than for \nthose of the other companies.\n  This problem can be readily addressed by directing States to award \ncontracts on the basis of the lowest net wholesale price--as most \nStates currently do--rather than on the basis of the biggest rebate, \nexcept where the State has reliable data showing that retail prices for \ndifferent formula brands are similar in the State. In any State where \nthis is the case, the State would retain full flexibility as to the \nbasis on which to award its contract.\n  In 1990, the GAO wrote:\n\n       Because only three firms are responsible for almost all \n     domestic infant formula production, coordination of pricing \n     and marketing strategies between the manufacturers is always \n     a potential danger. Competitive bidding will successfully \n     yield high rebates only to the extent that infant formula \n     manufacturers act independently. Consequently, efforts to \n     assure competition in the infant formula industry will be an \n     important element in State efforts to maximize cost-\n     containment savings. (GAO, Infant Formula: Cost Containment \n     and Competition in the WIC Program, September 1990.)\n\n  This remedy of awarding contracts on a lowest net wholesale price \nwould help avert the loss of hundreds of millions of dollars in cost \ncontainment savings and thereby prevent hundreds of thousands of women \nand children from being dropped from the program. Nearly one of every \nfour WIC participants is served with cost containment savings--and \nwould have to be removed from the program if cost containment \ncollapses.\n  The Senate, unlike the House, has managed to correct this problem in \nthe Agriculture appropriations bill. Therefore, in conference, it is \nimperative that the Senate language on WIC cost containment prevail.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I rise today to highlight a provision in \nthe agriculture appropriations bill that I think makes an important \nimprovement to the WIC Program. I want to highlight the importance of \nthis provision with hope that we can maintain it in the conference \ncommittee.\n  The WIC infant formula cost containment program saves more than $1 \nbillion a year in Federal funds and allows over 1.6 million more women, \ninfants, and children to be served through WIC each month than would \notherwise be the case. Nearly one of every four WIC participants is \nserved with cost containment savings and would have to be removed from \nthe program if cost containment collapsed.\n  There is a danger now developing that threatens to undermine WIC cost \ncontainment and we need Federal action to counteract this development. \nIn the past, States typically awarded their WIC contract to the company \nwhose net wholesale price is the lowest. The net wholesale price \nrepresents the wholesale price of the product minus the rebate per can \nthe manufacturer will pay the State WIC program. Recently, though, \nStates have begun to award their WIC contracts to the company that \noffered the highest rebate per can, regardless of the company's \nwholesale price. A provision contained in this bill requires that \nStates award contracts on the basis of the lowest net wholesale price--\nas most States currently do--rather than on the basis of the biggest \nrebate. An exception would exist if the State has reliable data showing \nthat it makes no difference in the cost outcome whether the contract is \nawarded on the basis of rebate or net wholesale price.\n  Let me take a few moments to describe to my colleagues the flaws of \nthe rebate methodology. This methodology is faulty for two reasons:\n  First, it discriminates against a company that charges low wholesale \nprices.\n\n[[Page S8456]]\n\nAn industry heavyweight can sell the product for, say $2.50 per can and \nthen give the State a rebate of $2.00 per can of formula. Under that \nscenario, the net wholesale price to the program is 50 cents per can of \ninfant formula. A smaller company, on the other hand, may not be able \nto demand as high a retail price and they may charge only $1.95 per can \nof formula. At a $1.95 retail, the smaller company can't begin to \ncompete on the basis of rebate, they'd be losing money on every can of \nformula. What the company could do is offer a rebate of $1.50, setting \nthe net wholesale price at 45 cents per can. Ultimately the smaller \ncompany will save the WIC Program a lot of money. But they will never \nhave the opportunity to do so if the only thing the State looks to is \nthe rebate amount.\n  The second problem with this contract methodology is apparent in the \nscenario I've just described. Not only does the highest rebate \nmethodology discriminate against small companies, it could cost the WIC \nProgram up to $1 billion a year.\n  Approaching WIC infant formula contracts on the basis of who offers \nthe highest rebate just doesn't make sense. We know from experience \nthat a truly competitive bidding process will save the WIC program more \nthan $1 billion a year.\n  I'll close by thanking Senator Cochran and Senator Hatfield for \nincluding this cost containment measure in the Agriculture \nAppropriations bill we're now discussing, and I urge my colleagues \nserving on the conference committee to support this provision in the \nconference bill.\n\n\n               Amendments Nos. 4972 through 4974, En Bloc\n\n  Mr. COCHRAN.

Mr. President, I urge the adoption of the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I am pleased that the managers of the bill \nare willing to accept my amendment to correct a problem that has arisen \nwith regard to special research grants section of the Agriculture \nappropriations bill.\n  Specifically, when the Agriculture Appropriations Subcommittee \nrequested information from USDA/CSREES regarding special research grant \nprojects, the Babcock Institute for International Dairy Research and \nDevelopment at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, was mistakenly \nlisted as one of the several projects slated for completion at the end \nof fiscal year 1996. Unfortunately, that information was not accurate. \nHowever, this error was not noticed until after the committee had acted \non the bill, and funding for the Babcock Institute was omitted from the \nCommittee Report entirely.\n  Therefore, my amendment will simply restore funding for the Babcock \nInstitute in the CSREES special grant\n\n[[Page S8457]]\n\nsection of the bill. The funding provided is $312,000, the same as \nprovided in fiscal year 1996.\n  The importance of the research conducted by the Babcock Institute has \nnever been more important than it is today. The domestic market for \nmany U.S. dairy products will grow less rapidly in the future as the \npopulation ages and consumption patterns change. Further, the dairy \nprovisions of the 1996 farm bill also signal the need for dairy farmers \nto look more toward international markets for their livelihoods. \nInternational markets for dairy products are changing in ways that \ncrate opportunities for U.S. dairy farmers, as well as dairy exporters. \nBut along with these developments come many research questions, related \nto how foreign competitors operate, and the risks associated with \nexport markets. Through its research on many of these topics, the \nBabcock Institute will continue to play an important role for the U.S. \ndairy industry as it seeks to turn its attention more toward \ninternational markets.\n  Again, I thank the managers for their support of this amendment, and \nlook forward to working with them to retain funding for this valuable \nprogram in conference.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, I urge the adoption of the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 4976) was agreed to.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, if I could speak very briefly about a \nparticular provision in the legislation which is a matter of some \nconcern. I do not intend to take time this evening nor do I intend to \ndelay consideration, but I would like to bring to the attention one of \nthe provisions that has been included here that I think the Members \nshould have at least some awareness of.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts is recognized.\n\n\n                          MEDGUIDE REGULATIONS\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I want to draw attention to provisions in \nthe appropriation bill that deal with a matter of priority for the FDA, \nand that is on the proposed Medguide regulations which would establish \ngoals for industries to meet on the issues of prescription drugs. I \njust want to speak for a few moments on this issue this evening, then \nindicate to the managers some alternatives that we are thinking about \nand want to talk over with the managers again tomorrow.\n  This appropriation bill contains an unwarranted provision that will \nundermine the Food and Drug Administration's efforts to prevent adverse \nreactions that cost the American economy an estimated $100 billion a \nyear in direct and indirect costs. That cost is as much as, if not \nmore, than the country spends on prescription drugs in the first place.\n  The provision would forbid the FDA from going forward with a proposed \nregulation, called the Medguide regulation, to ensure that patients get \nadequate information when they buy a prescription.\n  The FDA's efforts to ensure that the American consumer gets good \ninformation when they buy prescription drugs have been under attack by \na consortium of pharmacists and other businesses who claim they are \nalready doing an effective job of getting information to consumers \nwithout Government regulation.\n  The facts are to the contrary. For example, in 1992, FDA required a \nboxed warning--the most serious kind of warning--on labeling for \nSeldane and Hismanal, two of the most popular antihistamines for \nallergies. When taken in association with certain antibiotics and \nantifungals, there have been deaths and serious cardiovascular events.\n  These same warnings also appeared in the FDA-approved consumer \nadvertising and magazines such as People, Time, and Newsweek. These \nwarnings about taking these drugs in combination did not appear on the \ninformation sheets that pharmacists gave to consumers--information that \nwas written after these warnings went into effect. In fact, consumers \nwere given better information in magazine ads than they were given by \nthe pharmacists who dispensed their prescriptions.\n  Even today, after concerted efforts to educate physicians and \npharmacists about the dangers of prescribing Seldane with certain \nantibiotics, 2.5 percent are coprescriptions written in conjunction \nwith one of those antibiotics, erythromycin. As a result, tens of \nthousands of patients are presently at risk.\n  FDA's concerns are not speculative. A 29-year-old woman taking \nSeldane died because she was not warned about the risk of taking it \nwith an antifungal. If she had been warned of this possibility of a \nfatal interaction she might be alive today.\n  Leaving out critical warnings is unacceptable. In these types of \nlife-and-death cases, FDA oversight is clearly warranted. The health \nand the lives of too many patients is at stake.\n  FDA has rightfully decided that consumers deserve more protection \nthan the status quo. The Medguide regulation is intended to correct \nthis gross deficiency in our consumer protection laws.\n  Today, we go into a supermarket to buy a loaf of bread, a carton of \nmilk, or a box of cereal, and we know there is complete nutritional \ninformation on the package. When we buy an over-the-counter drug like \naspirin or Tylenol in the same grocery store, FDA regulations require \nthe drugs to have complete information so that those who take the pills \nunderstand what they are doing, how to take it, the side effects to \nwatch out for, what foods or drugs it interacts with.\n  But, if we buy a prescription drug in the pharmacy or one of these \nsame grocery stores, there is no guarantee that we will get the same \nkind of information when the prescription is filled. Current laws \nrequire more information about breakfast cereals than dangerous \nprescription drugs.\n  The costs of this lack of information are high. Mr. President, 30 to \n50 percent of adult patients do not use their medications properly, and \nlack of information is one of the primary reasons. In children, \nnoncompliance exceeds 50 percent. In the elderly, who rely most heavily \non medication, noncompliance is often higher.\n  If patients do not take medication properly, they are poorly served \nby their health care system. The public health is put at risk if \nunsecured infections are transmitted and resistant infections develop.\n  The cost of misuse of prescription drugs and adverse reactions to \ndrugs is estimated at $20 billion a year in the elderly alone. \nIndustry's own estimates place the indirect costs at five times \nhigher--$100 billion a year when lost productivity and reduced quality \nof life are included.\n  To avoid further tragedies and lower costs, the proposed Medguide \nregulations would establish concrete goals for industries to meet. By \nthe year 2000, FDA seeks to ensure that at least 75 percent of patients \nwith new prescriptions would obtain adequate, useful, easily understood \nwritten information. By the year 2006, 95 percent of patients with new \nprescriptions would receive this information. That is a goal by the \nyear 2000, that 75 percent would receive adequate information; and 95 \npercent by the year 2006. It does not seem to me to be enormously \nprohibitive.\n  Working with drug companies, pharmacists, physicians and consumers, \nFDA plans to establish nonbinding guidelines on such information. These \nguidelines will help pharmacies ensure that the written information \nthey give out is adequate.\n  If the goals set out in the proposed regulation are not met, FDA \nwould either institute a mandatory program or seek public comment on \nwhat steps to take next.\n  This approach is reasonable. It gives the private sector the \nopportunity to achieve compliance without regulatory requirements over \nthe next 4 years. Yet industry still objects. It claims that neither \nthe Medguide regulation, nor any binding requirements are necessary. \nClearly, if the industry meets the health goals by the year 2000, no \nbinding requirements would be imposed. These goals were established in \na bipartisan fashion during the Bush Administration. They should be \nhonored by Congress today. The guidelines that have been established \nwere established under the Republican administration with the support \nof the industry at that particular time.\n  The industry has already failed to deliver on its promise of \nvoluntary action. In 1982, a regulation mandating that information be \ngiven to patients\n\n[[Page S8458]]\n\nwhen they buy new prescriptions was withdrawn, because the private \nsector promised it can do better without regulations.\n  This whole proposal that is out there builds on a long history of \nrelationship between the agency and the industries which are affected, \nand an agreement had been worked out. Now there is an attempt to \ncircumvent that agreement to the disadvantage of consumers.\n  FDA then monitored the industry's efforts of 1982, and found that few \npatients were getting information, and much of the information was not \nadequate, and that failure led to the rulemaking that the industry is \nnow trying to avoid.\n  The provision in the appropriation bill states that if the private \nsector develops a plan within 120 days of enactment, FDA's rulemaking \nis suspended. We understand that now. The provision in the \nappropriation bill states if the private sector develops a plan within \n120 days of enactment, FDA's rulemaking is suspended. However, the \nSecretary of HHS and the commissioner cannot review the voluntary \nprogram to determine if it is, in fact, adequate. The only action that \nHHS or FDA is allowed to take is to order the plan to see if it meets \nthe goals set by the industry. So this is an industry plan. They could \ndevelop it within 120 days. The FDA is prohibited from protecting \nconsumers. The only ability FDA has is eventually auditing the industry \nprogram to find out if there has been compliance with the industry \nprogram.\n\n  Mr. President, this is on an issue of such vital importance to the \nconsumers. We have a solid record in our committee on adverse drug \nreactions and on what the industry has been willing to do, what they \nhave not done, and what we have reviewed in our committee and is a part \nof the FDA reform program, which the leader indicated they are going to \ncall up. But we have just heard about this proposal in the last several \nhours. The bill further hamstrings FDA by precluding activities such as \nguidelines that might assist the private sector.\n  This provision is an abdication of Congress' responsibility to \nprotect the public health. Instead of responsible action by the FDA, an \nindustry with an unsatisfactory track record is permitted to regulate \nitself without any FDA oversight of their program. That is inadequate.\n  Mr. President, tomorrow, I will have an amendment to address that \nparticular issue. I will consult with the floor managers to find out \nabout whether they share the sense or concern which I have spoken to \nthis afternoon and if they have a way to try to address it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who seeks recognition?\n  Mr. BRYAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada is recognized.\n  Mr. BRYAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the pending \namendment be laid aside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4977\n\n       (Purpose: To limit funding for the market access program)\n\n  Mr. BRYAN. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask for \nits immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Nevada [Mr. Bryan], for himself, Mr. \n     Kerry, and Mr. Gregg, proposes an amendment numbered 4977.\n\n  Mr. BRYAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n       At the end of the bill, add the following:\n\n     SEC.   . FUNDING LIMITATIONS FOR MARKET ACCESS PROGRAM.\n\n       None of the funds made available under this Act may be used \n     to carry out the market access program pursuant to section \n     203 of the Agricultural Trade Act of 1978 (7 U.S.C. 5623) if \n     the aggregate amount of funds and value of commodities under \n     the program exceeds $70,000,000.\n\n  Mr. BRYAN. Mr. President, this amendment is regarding the Market \nAccess Program. The Market Access Program, or MAP, was created to \nencourage the development, maintenance, and expansion of exports of \nU.S. agricultural products. MAP is the successor to the Market \nPromotion Program [MPP], which in turn was the successor to the \nTargeted Export Assistance Program [TEA], established in 1986. TEA was \noriginally created to ``counter or offset the adverse effect of \nsubsidies, import quotas, or other unfair trade practices of foreign \ncompetitors on U.S. agriculture exports.'' Since 1986, over $1.43 \nbillion has been spent for TEA, MPP and now MAP.\n  MAP is operated through about 64 organizations that either run market \npromotion programs themselves or pass the funds along to companies to \nspend on their own market promotion efforts. In fiscal year 1994, about \n43 percent of all program activities involved generic promotions while \n57 percent involved branded promotions.\n  The General Accounting Office [GAO] has pointed out that the entire \nFederal Government spends about $3.5 billion annually on export \npromotion. While agricultural products account for only 10 percent of \ntotal U.S. exports, the Department of Agriculture spends about $2.2 \nbillion, or 63 percent of the total. The Department of Commerce spends \n$236 million annually on trade promotion.\n  While the stated goal of MAP is to benefit U.S. farmers, the program \nhas benefited foreign companies. In fiscal years 1986-1993, $92 million \non MPP funds went to foreign-based firms. This amount represented \nnearly 20 percent of the total funds allocated for brand-name \npromotions during the 8-year period. In fiscal year 1995, 49 foreign-\nbased firms received MPP funds; in fiscal year 1994 over 110 foreign \nfirms received MPP funds from the U.S. Treasury. I found this to be \nunfathomable, and I offered an amendment to remedy this to the 1996 \nfarm bill. My amendment passed, and I am pleased to say that MAP money \ncan no longer be given to foreign corporations.\n  Still, many problems exist with the MAP program:\n  First, wasted dollars: There is still no proof that MAP funds are not \nsimply replacing funds that would have been spent anyway on \nadvertising. USDA does not have any good data on this phenomenon. \nCommercial firms still have the opportunity to substitute MAP funds for \npromotional activities they would have otherwise undertaken with their \nown funds.\n  Second, graduation: Current regulations require MAP assistance to \ncease after 5 years. However, the 5-year clock started running in 1994. \nThis means that some companies will have been in the program for 13 \nyears at the end of 1999. Thirteen years is enough time to overcome \nbarriers and develop markets. Already, 136 firms have participated in \nthis program for 6 to 8 years and have received the bulk of the brand-\nname funds.\n  Third, efficiency: GAO states that taxpayers do not have reasonable \nassurance that the considerable public funds expended on export \npromotion are being effectively used to emphasize sectors and programs \nwith the highest potential returns. MAP supporters use examples of \nincreased exports to defend this program. However, even if a brand-name \npromotion effort results in identifiable increases in exports, unless \nthe Foreign Agriculture Service [FAS] can convincingly demonstrate that \nthe promotion effort would not have been undertaken without MAP \nassistance, those increases in exports cannot be attributed to the \nprogram.\n  Since 1986 there have been over 100 participants in the program, and \nyet the Foreign Agriculture Service has completed only 12 program \nevaluations. Only 9 of 26 participants who have received over $10 \nmillion have been evaluated.\n  Fourth, U.S. content: MAP regulations issued in August 1991 do not \nrestrict program participation to products that have 100 percent U.S. \ncontent. Regulations permit full funding for products that have at \nleast 50 percent U.S. content by weight.\n  There is no dependable data on percent of U.S. content. The Foreign \nAgriculture Service relies on statements made in MAP applications about \nU.S. content and not-for-profit organizations rely on unverified \nstatements regarding U.S. content from their branded participants. In \n1993, the Foreign Agriculture Service began to review the support for \nthe certifications made\n\n[[Page S8459]]\n\nregarding U.S. content during their audits of participants. Their work \nis limited to the not-for-profit organizations and they do not, as a \nrule, audit the commercial entities performing brand-name promotions.\n  Who should get these funds? Although new guidelines say small firms \nshould have priority--one third of fiscal year 1994 funds went to large \ncompanies. For that reason, large corporations such as Sunkist, Sun-\nMaid, Welch's, and Pillsbury still receive large sums of money. In \n1992, the average amount awarded to the top 50 firms was $1 million. \nEight of those firms had sales over $1 billion.\n  There were 17 MAP participants receiving more than $1 million for \nfiscal years 1993-95:\n  Sunkist, $11.1 million.\n  Ernest & Julio Gallo, $9.1 million.\n  Sunsweet, $4.6 million.\n  Blue Diamond, $4.5 million.\n  American Legend, $2.9 million.\n  North Am. Fur Producers, $2.3 million.\n  Dole, $2.1 million.\n  Tyson Foods, $1.9 million.\n  M Mars, $1.8 million.\n  21st Century Genetics, $1.5 million.\n  Welch Foods, $1.4 million.\n  Pillsbury, $1.3 million.\n  Campbell Soup, $1.2 million.\n  Hansa-Pacific, $1.1 million.\n  Hershey, $1.1 million.\n  Canandaigua Wine, $1.1 million.\n  Seagram, $1.0 million.\n  Private, for-profit companies are the ones who benefit from this \nprogram. Taxpayers should not pay for advertising particular products. \nThese companies should take over the costs themselves. MAP, like MPP \nand TEA before it, is a convenient source of free cash for wealthy \nbusinesses, such as McDonald's, to help pay for their overseas \nadvertising budgets.\n  While the Federal Government does have a legitimate role in promoting \nexports to foreign countries, we should use our considerable Federal \nexpertise to assist companies in cutting red tape in foreign countries \nand providing them with technical assistance. We should not do it by \ngranting scarce taxpayer dollars to private, for-profit companies for \nactivities they would otherwise conduct on their own.\n  Mr. President, the amendment I offer today is nearly identical to the \nposition the Senate took on the Federal Agricultural Improvement and \nReform Act, or farm bill, of 1996. The Senate voted 59 to 37 in \nFebruary to accept the Bryan amendment on the MPP program. That \namendment restricted use of MPP program moneys to small businesses, as \ncertified by the Small Business Administration, and Capper-Volstead \ncooperatives. Because the amendment eliminated foreign companies from \nthe program, the funding level for MPP was capped at $70 million.\n  In the House-Senate conference on the farm bill, my language \nprohibiting foreign companies from participation in MPP was retained, \nbut the level of funding was raised to $90 million. So while the \nconferees were attempting to reform the MPP program by removing foreign \ncompanies, they also enacted a 29-percent increase in funding. My \namendment would return the MAP program to the originally approved \nSenate funding level of $70 million. This represents no real cut to the \nprogram as foreign companies may no longer participate. This frees up \nfunds for domestic businesses.\n  Mr. President, reiterating, I am renewing an effort that I had been \ninvolved in--as Members will be familiar with--for some years. It is a \nprogram that was originally known as the Targeted Export Assistance \nProgram. A little later iteration referred to it as the Market \nPromotion Program, and it has now evolved into the Market Access \nProgram.\n  The historical genesis, as well as the ostensible premise for its \ncontinuation, is an effort to encourage the development, maintenance, \nand expansion of exports of U.S. agricultural products abroad, \noriginally designed to counter or offset the adverse effects of \nsubsidies, import quotas, and other unfair trade practices.\n  Since 1986, TEA, MPP, and now MAP, has resulted in the expenditure of \n$1.5 billion. This program is operated through about 64 different \norganizations, as I know the distinguished Presiding Officer and the \nchairman of the committee are both very familiar with. In fiscal year \n1994, about 43 percent of all program activities involved generic \npromotions, while 57 percent involved branded promotions. By that, Mr. \nPresident, we mean specific products of company A, B, C, or D.\n  We will talk later about some of the companies who have received very \ngenerous amounts of taxpayer dollars to support a program which, in the \nview of this Senator, amounts to a corporate entitlement program that \ncould not have been justified even in the most affluent circumstances \nat the Federal level. Now, while we are trying to downsize, streamline, \ncut expenditures, and reach targeted goals for balancing our budget by \n2002 or 2003, this is precisely the kind of program that is still a \nlegacy of the past and, in my judgment, one I cannot support on its \nmerits.\n  I think it might be helpful to note that the Federal Government \nspends about $3.5 million annually on export promotion activities. \nAgricultural products represent about 10 percent of the total U.S. \nexports. Yet, of that $3.5 billion spent at the Federal level, about \n$2.2 billion, or 63 percent of the total amount, is spent on \nagricultural export promotion. The Department of Commerce, for example, \nspends about $236 million annually on trade promotion.\n  Now, earlier this year, Mr. President, one of the objections that \nthis Senator and others raised was that a substantial amount of the \nfunding on this program went not to American companies, but went to \nforeign companies. So joining with the distinguished occupant of the \nchair, and other colleagues on both sides of the political aisle, we \nwere able to get an amendment through that, as it ultimately worked its \nway through the legislative process, dealt with one issue which, in my \njudgment, was inconceivable, unfathomable, in that we would continue to \nprovide money to foreign companies with taxpayer dollars. I am happy to \nreport that, in the legislation that passed, we have now eliminated \nmoneys that previously went to foreign-based firms. So, prospectively, \nthat can no longer occur, and the money that we are talking about here \nthis afternoon will no longer be given to foreign corporations. But the \nfundamental objections to the programs remain.\n  First, the General Accounting Office, which has evaluated this \nprogram, has determined that these are wasted dollars. There is no \nevidence to support the proposition that money which ostensibly is \ngiven to companies to augment or increase their promotional activities \nhas simply not been used to replace existing dollars already in these \nmajor corporations' advertising accounts. So rather than a McDonald's \nspending $500 million a year, if they get $4 million or $5 million, \nthey reduce the amount of their own budget allocation to $496 million \n--the point being that there is no extra dollar outlay spent on the \npromotion and advertising of these products. That is to even accept the \nproposition that you can target or trace a correlation between the \namount of money that is spent on advertising dollars and the kind of \nproducts that these companies are able to market overseas.\n  So that is the first objection raised, and that is as valid today as \nit was when the General Accounting Office did its evaluation some 5 \nyears ago that there is no assurance of companies simply not trading \ntheir own corporate dollars and replacing them with dollars that the \nAmerican taxpayers pay.\n  The second is a graduation problem. There is no graduation formula. \nHow long does one remain as part of the program? Current regulations, \nenacted in response to criticisms made by this Senator and others about \nthe merits of the program, ultimately caused the reevaluation of the \nregulation so that this MAP assistance will cease after 5 years. \nHowever, those who continue to benefit from this financial allocation \nprovided at taxpayer expense target it to 5 years to run prospectively \nfrom the date of the enactment of the regulation, so you can still stay \non this program up until 1999.\n  Now, for some companies, that would mean being a part of this program \nfor 13 years. That is an incredibly long period of time. If you find \nany merit to this program--and I must say I am one who finds none--how \ndo you justify keeping a particular company as part of this program for \nup to 13 years? Already, 136 firms have participated in\n\n[[Page S8460]]\n\nthe program for 6 to 8 years and have received the bulk of the brand-\nname funds.\n  The third objection is a question of efficiency. GAO states that \ntaxpayers do not have any reasonable assurances that the rather \nconsiderable public funds expended on export promotion are being \neffectively used to emphasize sectors and programs with the highest \npotential returns. It is frequently said in the course of debate--and I \nam sure will be again in the context of this amendment--where \nsupporters of this program cite increased exports as an example of why \nthis program is so needed, why it is so beneficial, why it does so much \ngood. But there is no analytical correlation between those increases in \nexports and moneys being expended from the program. That is to say, \nwould those increases have occurred notwithstanding the allocations \nmade under the MAP program? Since 1986, there have been over 100 \nparticipants in the program, and yet the Foreign Agricultural Service \nhas completed only 12 program evaluations. Only 9 of 26 participants \nwho have received more than $10 million have been evaluated.\n\n  Finally, Mr. President, on the question of U.S. content, MAP \nregulations issued in August 1991 do not restrict program participation \nto products that have 100 percent U.S. content. Regulations permit full \nfunding for products that have no more than 50 percent of U.S. content \nby weight.\n  There is no dependable data on the percent of U.S. content. The \nForeign Agricultural Service relies on statements made in MAP \napplications about U.S. content to ascertain the amount of U.S. content \nwithout doing an independent analysis. So these are self-certified \nstatements without any type of independent verification whatsoever.\n  The question is: Who should get these funds? Although new guidelines \nsay some small firms should have priority, one-third of fiscal year \n1994 funds went to large companies. It is for that reason that some of \nthe largest corporations in America--among them Sunkist, Sun Maid, \nWelch's, and Pillsbury--still receive large sums of money. In 1992, the \naverage amount awarded to the top 50 firms was $1 million. Eight of \nthose firms have sales over $1 billion.\n  I am sure most Americans would ponder, with a company that has a \nsales volume of $1 billion, should the American taxpayer be subsidizing \nthe advertising account of a firm of that size? I must say again that I \ndo not believe that should justify defending those appropriations.\n  But to give you some more current data, there were 17 MAP \nparticipants receiving more than $1 million for the past 2 fiscal \nyears, fiscal year 1993 to fiscal year 1995: Sunkist, $11.1 million; \nErnest & Julio Gallo, $9.1 million; Sunsweet, $4.6 billion; Blue \nDiamond, $4.5 million; American Legend, $2.9 million; North America Fur \nProducers, $2.3 million; Dole, $2.1 million; Tyson Foods, $1.9 million; \nM Mars, $1.8 million; 21st Century Genetics, $1.5 million; Welch \nFoods, $l.4 million; Pillsbury, $1.3 million; Campbell Soup, $1.2 \nmillion; Hansa-Pacific, $1.1 million; Hershey, $1.1 million; Seagram, \n$1 million.\n  Mr. President, those are some of the great household names of \nAmerica. These are companies that have been exceedingly successful, and \nall of us as Americans quite curiously share in their success. We are \ndelighted when American firms prosper and do well. But why should they \ndo well at the expense of the taxpayer who is being asked to pay his \nand her hard-earned dollars to supplement the advertising accounts of \nsome of the largest companies in America?\n  I believe that the Federal Government has a legitimate role in \npromoting exports to foreign countries, but we should certainly use our \nconsiderable expertise to assist companies in cutting red tape in \nforeign countries and providing them with technical assistance. We \nshould not do it by granting scarce taxpayer dollars to private \ncompanies, either, for-profit companies, or activities that they would \notherwise conduct on their own.\n  So, Mr. President, that brings me to the point of what our amendment \nthat I offer this afternoon would do. It is identical virtually to the \nposition that the Senate took on the Federal Agricultural Improvement \nand Reform Act, commonly referred to as the farm bill of 1996. The \nSenate voted by 59 to 37 in February to accept the Bryan amendment on \nthe MPP program, and that amendment restricted use of MPP moneys to \nsmall businesses certified by the Small Business Administration and \nCapper-Volstead cooperatives. Because the amendment eliminated foreign \ncompanies from the program, the funding level for MPP was capped at $70 \nmillion. That is to say, based upon the recent experience of the Market \nPromotion Program, out of an appropriation of $110 million it was \nprojected that $40 million was being allocated to foreign companies. So \nif you flatten out the program and keep it at its present level, $70 \nmillion would continue to fund the program other than for foreign \ncompany participation.\n  I make it clear that I think none of my colleagues are misled about \nthis. My preference would be to zero out this program for all of the \nreasons that I have outlined. And I daresay I think the distinguished \noccupant of the chair shares the view of the Senator from Nevada. But \nyielding to pragmatic imperatives, it is clear that this body is not \nyet prepared to go that far.\n  So what this amendment would do would be to cap the current level at \n$70 million. The current appropriations bill provides for $90 million. \nSo when you factor out that none of this money can go to foreign \ncompanies, in effect, this program would be increased by 29-percent--a \n29-percent increase.\n  The amendment that I have offered would return this program to the \noriginally approved Senate funding level of $70 million. That, I \nbelieve, is a reasonable compromise, and I believe that my colleagues \nhaving voted once before by 59 to 37 to cap the program at that level \nand to carry out the intent of the farm bill of 1996, we ought to hold \nthe appropriations to the level authorized in that bill.\n  Mr. President, I thank the Chair. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I am pleased to join my friend from Nevada, \nSenator Bryan, in another attempt to save American taxpayers from \nfunding U.S. corporate advertising in other countries. The Market \nPromotion Program is one of the most blatant examples of corporate \nwelfare in the budget--the American taxpayers have footed a bill of \nmore than $1 billion to pay for corporate advertising since its \ninception. And Senator Bryan and I have been as tenacious as it is \npossible to be in trying to eliminate this program.\n  This is a subsidy program which has been roundly criticized by \nresearch institutes across the political and economic spectrum--the \nNational Taxpayers' Union, the Progressive Policy Institute, Citizens \nAgainst Government Waste, and Cato Institute.\n  Taxpayers in Massachusetts would be shocked if they knew that the \nFederal Government is collecting taxes from them and using their hard-\nearned money to embellish the advertising budgets of corporate America.\n  I have taken to the floor time and time again to speak about wasteful \nspending in the budget. And I have been an outspoken critic of this \nMarket Promotion Program. Our colleagues have heard me discuss how we \nhave paid the Gallo Bros. to peddle their wine to the French; how we \nhelped advertise Japanese-made underwear in Tokyo; how we promoted \nfashion shows of mink coats and fur stoles; how we have subsidized \nM's and Chicken McNuggets.\n  We have tried to reform the MPP program over the past few years. Last \nyear, we prohibited the mink industry from receiving Federal subsidies \nto promote fashion shows abroad. That was a step in the right \ndirection. And, Mr. President, I am very pleased the distinguished \nchairman of the Agriculture Appropriations Subcommittee, Senator \nCochran, has agreed to exclude mink subsidies in this year's bill. In \naddition, Mr. President, last year, in the Department of Agriculture \nappropriations bill, the Senate voted to curb the Market Promotion \nProgram--we passed the Bryan-Bumpers-Kerry amendment to limit the \nprogram to small businesses and agricultural co-ops. This was a good \nstart to curb corporate welfare, but the provision was dropped in \nconference. So, the program continues despite the Senate's vote.\n  Accordingly, my friend from Nevada, Senator Bryan, and I are making \nthe effort once again to halt this unnecessary flow of funds from the \nTreasury.\n\n[[Page S8461]]\n\n We must not force American taxpayers to keep subsidizing multimillion-\ndollar corporations. When my friends and neighbors in Massachusetts \nmeasure this program against the extraordinary reductions we are facing \nin programs that really matter to working Americans, they ask me how \nCongress can continue to justify this type of corporate welfare. There \nis no good answer to that question. This program is unjustifiable in \nthe current budget environment.\n  Mr. President, I am grateful Senator Bryan is willing to lead the \ncharge. Together, we will continue to fight this waste of taxpayer \nmoney until this program is eliminated. We fought the wool and mohair \nsubsidy, and that is now gone. We fought the mink subsidy, and that is \nnow gone. Ultimately, we will win this battle, too, because the Senate \nwill recognize that it is a monumental waste of money. I yield the \nfloor.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, this Market Promotion Program has been \none that has attracted an awful lot of attention and some controversy \nover the last several years. Senators have heard the arguments for it \nand against it, and why it is important for us to continue to support \nthose who are trying to market their commodities and food products in \noverseas markets, particularly when they are confronted with trade \npractices that are developed by our competitors, or even those \ncountries in which we are trying to export our products that operate \nagainst our interests.\n  Under the rules of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, we \nhave tried to reduce barriers to trade, make the playing field fair, \nand have as a principle for our international trade that if we are \ngoing to make available our market here in the United States, we are \ngoing to insist that other countries do the same. But from time to \ntime, even though this is the general understanding and the general \nbasis for these international agreements, we run into specific \nproblems--structural difficulties, bureaucratic redtape, call it what \nyou will. It is all an effort to prefer one of our competitors over our \nexporters in these markets, or to keep us out of the markets \naltogether.\n  These funds have been very helpful, I am told at our hearings with \nthe Foreign Agriculture Service, in breaking down barriers to trade, to \novercoming these efforts to keep our suppliers and our exporters out of \ninternational markets.\n  There is no question that this is an area of economic activity that \nhas benefited American business, agriculture, and industry. We have \nseen a growing amount of jobs created in our own economy here at home \nbecause of access to overseas markets for our products. There is a \ndirect correlation between the amount of exporting we do and the amount \nof benefit we get economically here in terms of jobs, pay for workers, \nand renewed and invigorated business activity.\n  It has been consistently shown on the basis of experience that we \nhave had using these funds that as we provide assistance to exporters \nand suppliers in international markets, we do better; we sell more; we \nare more successful. I hope the Senate will not be persuaded to further \nreduce the ability of the Foreign Agriculture Service to go to bat for \nour exporters, to try to help where help is needed, and use these funds \nin a targeted way, in a way that is designed to help us sell more of \nwhat we produce in these emerging markets around the world.\n  I know that we are not going to resolve this issue tonight, and we \nhave a lot of information that will be available to Senators, but \nalmost all the Senators who are going to vote--and I presume we are \ngoing to go to a record vote on this unless the Senator decides to \nwithdraw his amendment on the basis of my overwhelmingly persuasive \nremarks in opposition to his amendment. I presume we are going to vote \non this amendment tomorrow.\n  Mr. BRYAN. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. COCHRAN. I will be happy to yield to my friend from Nevada.\n  Mr. BRYAN. I always find my friend from Mississippi extraordinarily \narticulate. Without any derogation intended, he has not persuaded this \nSenator. At this particular point, it would be my intent to ask for a \nrollcall vote at the appropriate time. And I can assure the Senator I \ndo not intend to prolong the debate tonight, but when he finishes, I \nmight just make a very brief comment.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. I thank the Senator. I know he is committed on this \nissue. He raises it from time to time. I do appreciate the fact we do \nnot have all the charts and other things that he has brought to the \nfloor in the past to persuade Senators on the correctness of his \nposition, but he is certainly correct in pointing out that this issue \nwas debated fully, extensively in the discussion of the farm bill \nearlier this year. The farm bill did have provisions relating to the \nprogram, and so Senators are familiar with it, and they are familiar \nwith the arguments for and against.\n  I am not going to belabor the issue again. I hope Senators will \nreject the amendment and support the committee's funding level for this \nprogram. It is, I would say, consistent with the authorization \ncontained in the conference report of the farm bill.\n  I rest my case, and I am happy for the Senate to work its will on \nthis subject. I hope they will support the decision that we made in the \ncommittee.\n  Mr. BRYAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. BRYAN. I ask unanimous consent that the distinguished senior \nSenator from Arkansas be added as a cosponsor of this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BRYAN. If I may very briefly respond to my friend from \nMississippi, and then I will yield to my friend from Arkansas, it seems \nto me that we talk a lot about sacrifice--the need for us to notch up \nthe proverbial belt and slim down, streamline Government, all of these \nsorts of things, and we ask most segments in our society to do more \nwith less.\n  I must say, with all due respect to my friend from Mississippi, it \nseems to me that those who are part of this corporate entitlement \nprogram that has been culturally ingrained as part of this Federal \nbudget process, we never ask them. I do not think it is asking too much \nof our friends, the McDonald's hamburger people, Pillsbury, the \nWelch's, Sunkist, Sun Maid, Seagrams, all these other marvelous \ncorporations to say, look, this is a program we thought we could afford \nat one time but this is 1996 and you folks have followed our debate on \nbalancing the budget. Both parties, both the Congress and the White \nHouse have agreed that a balanced budget ought to be our goal, that \nought to be a national priority. There are benefits that inure to our \nsociety, to our economy, and we cannot do that if we continue the old \nways, as comfortable as they may have become.\n  So I conclude with the observation that the $70 million is $70 \nmillion more than I would like to spend, but this appropriations bill \nsets a funding level of $90 million, so it does represent a 29 percent \nincrease over the $70 million that would be available under the \nparameters of the farm bill because we have deleted the money for \nforeign companies. It seems to me that a spirit of sacrifice and \nfairness would say, look, those who are the giants of corporate \nAmerica, they ought to be asked to trim their sails and to cut their \nspending a bit by enabling us to wean ourselves gradually from this \nprogram.\n  I thank the Chair. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed \nin the Record a letter that I received as chairman of the subcommittee \nfrom the Coalition of U.S. Exporters in support of the Market Access \nProgram.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                         Coalition to Promote U.S.\n\n\n                                         Agricultural Exports,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, July 9, 1996.\n     Hon. Thad Cochran,\n     Chairman, Subcommittee on Agriculture, Rural Development, and \n         Related Agencies, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: As Congress considers the FY 1997 \n     agriculture appropriations bill, we want to emphasize again \n     the need to maintain funding for USDA's export programs, \n     including the Market Access Program and FAS Cooperator \n     Program, as authorized under the new Farm Bill.\n       Such action is critical to the success of the new Farm \n     Bill, which gradually eliminates direct income assistance to \n     producers, while providing increased planting flexibility. \n     Within this framework, the long term viability of American \n     agriculture is even more dependent on ensuring access to \n     foreign markets and maintaining and expanding U.S. \n     agricultural exports.\n\n[[Page S8462]]\n\n       It is also vital to our nation's economic well-being. For \n     example, U.S. agricultural exports this year are now \n     projected to reach a record $60 billion. This is expected to \n     result in a record agriculture trade surplus of approximately \n     $30 billion, generate as much as $100 billion in related \n     economic activity, and provide jobs for over one million \n     Americans.\n       The Market Access Program, along with the FAS Cooperator \n     Program, are among the few programs specifically allowed \n     under the Uruguay Round Agreement and not subject to any \n     reduction or discipline. When other countries are \n     increasingly pursuing such policies to help their agriculture \n     industries maintain and expand their share of the world \n     market, now is not the time for the U.S. to continue to \n     unilaterally reduce or eliminate such programs.\n       Under the new Farm Bill, the Market Access Program already \n     has been reduced from $110 million to just $90 million \n     annually. The new Farm Bill also makes permanent the reforms \n     included in the FY 1996 agriculture appropriations bill, \n     including limiting any direct cost-share assistance to small \n     businesses, farmer cooperatives and trade associations.\n       Clearly, the Market Access Program and other USDA export \n     programs remain an essential element of our nation's overall \n     agriculture and trade policy. They are key to helping boost \n     U.S. agricultural exports, strengthening farm income, \n     promoting economic growth and creating needed jobs throughout \n     our entire economy. Accordingly, we urge your strong support \n     to ensure such programs continue to be fully funded and \n     aggressively implemented.\n           Sincerely,\n       Coalition to Promote U.S. Agricultural Exports.\n\n             Coalition to Promote U.S. Agricultural Exports\n\n\n                       coalition membership 1996\n\n       Ag Processing, Inc.\n       Alaska Seafood Marketing Institute.\n       American Farm Bureau Federation.\n       American Forest & Paper Association.\n       American Hardwood Export Council.\n       American Meat Institute.\n       American Plywood Association.\n       American Seed Trade Association.\n       American Sheep Industry Association.\n       American Soybean Association.\n       Blue Diamond Growers.\n       California Canning Peach Association.\n       California Kiwifruit Commission.\n       California Pistachio Commission.\n       California Prune Board.\n       California Table Grape Commission.\n       California Tomato Board.\n       California Walnut Commission.\n       Cherry Marketing Institute, Inc.\n       Chocolate Manufacturers Association.\n       Diamond Walnut Growers.\n       Eastern Agricultural and Food Export Council Corp.\n       Farmland Industries.\n       Florida Citrus Mutual.\n       Florida Citrus Packers.\n       Florida Department of Citrus.\n       Ginseng Board of Wisconsin.\n       Hop Growers of America.\n       International American Supermarkets Corp.\n       International Apple Institute.\n       International Dairy Foods Association.\n       Kentucky Distillers Association.\n       Mid-America International Agri-Trade Council.\n       National Dry Bean Council.\n       National Grape Cooperative Association, Inc.\n       National Association of State Departments of Agriculture.\n       National Cattlemen's Beef Association.\n       National Confectioners Association.\n       National Corn Growers Association.\n       National Council of Farmers Cooperatives.\n       National Cotton Council.\n       National Milk Producers Federation.\n       National Peanut Council of America.\n       National Porl Producers Council.\n       National Potato Council.\n       National Renderers Association.\n       National Sunflower Association.\n       National Wine Coalition.\n       NORPAC Foods, Inc.\n       Northwest Horticultural Council.\n       Produce Marketing Association.\n       Protein Grain Products International.\n       Sioux Honey Association.\n       Southern Forest Products Association.\n       Southern U.S. Trade Association.\n       Sun-Diamond Growers of California.\n       Sun Maid Raisin Growers of California.\n       Sunkist Growers.\n       Sunsweet Prune Growers.\n       The Catfish Institute.\n       The Popcorn Institute.\n       Tree Fruit Reserve.\n       Tree Top, Inc.\n       Tri Valley Growers.\n       United Egg Association.\n       United Egg Producers.\n       United Fresh Fruit and Vegetable Association.\n       USA Dry Pea & Lentil Council.\n       USA Poultry & Egg Export Council.\n       USA Rice Federation.\n       U.S. Feed Grains Council.\n       U.S. Livestock Genetics Exports, Inc.\n       U.S. Meat Export Federation.\n       U.S. Wheat Associates.\n       Vodka Producers of America.\n       Washington Apple Commission.\n       Western Pistachio Association.\n       Western U.S. Agricultural Trade Association.\n       Wine Institute.\n\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, first, let me say that my good friend, \nthe distinguished manager of the bill and the chairman of the \nSubcommittee on Agriculture Appropriations, and I very seldom disagree, \nand we have worked on a number of bills when I was chairman of this \nsubcommittee and now the last 2 years he has been chairman of the \nsubcommittee, and I think we have worked together well and produced \nreally good bills for the Senate's consideration. This is one of those \nrare occasions when we disagree.\n  I feel very strongly, and have for many years, that the Market \nPromotion Program, recently renamed the Market Access Program, is just \nshort of outrageous. When I first got involved in it, the General \nAccounting Office had just done a study. We were putting millions of \ndollars in a program to encourage McDonald's to sell Big Macs in \nMoscow. In addition, we were spending money to encourage one of the big \ncompanies in my own State, Tyson Foods, a company I am more than happy \nto champion on most occasions, to advertise their products overseas. \nFurther, Gallo wine was a big recipient. The liquor industry was \ngetting millions to export liquor.\n  I said last year, where is the Christian Coalition when we need them? \nBut we finally, through the determined efforts of the Senator from \nNevada, last year were able to change the people who were eligible to \nput a little bit of sense in it. We made a substantial contribution to \ncommon sense last year on the Senate floor, but unfortunately the \nconferee committee was not satisfied until they worked in a loophole \nbig enough to drive a Fortune 500 company through.\n  Having said that, let me say if I had a chance to eliminate the whole \nprogram as it currently operates at this moment, if I had the power to \ndo it, I would be more than happy to do it. But at least because of the \nefforts of the Senator from Nevada, we have been able to make it a \nlittle more palatable.\n  But think about this, Mr. President. We have capped the Export \nEnhancement Program now for 1997 at $100 million. But when you take the \nExport Enhancement Program, Public Law 480, which has been on the books \nfor decades--and there are three titles in that program, I, II, and \nIII, all designed and calculated to enhance agricultural exports--\neverybody is for agricultural exports. The USDA also has the GSM \nProgram as an export tool. There are the COAP and SOAP Programs. If it \nwere not for agricultural exports, the trade deficit in this country \nwould be really staggering. I am not sure what the correlation is in \nthe amounts between how much oil we import from around the world \ncompared to how many agricultural products we export, but I think the \ntwo are very similar. That will give you some idea how staggering the \ndeficit would be if we did not do a lot of agricultural exporting.\n  But when I think of the programs that run into hundreds of millions \nof dollars to export agriculture products and then here is this \nquestionable--well, it is not insignificant. It is $90 million. Where I \ncome from, that is considered sizable. Last year, we were able to cut \nthat program from $90 million to $70 million, and this year, lo and \nbehold, it is back to $90 million. So while we have been able to get \nthe Gallo Bros. and McDonald's and people like that out of the program, \nat least directly, and allow cooperatives such as my own Riceland \nFoods, and their farmer-members, to benefit from the program, we should \ncertainly not in the days of budget constraints that we are \nexperiencing now be raising that program by about 25 percent.\n  So, Mr. President, I will not belabor it. I see the Senator from \nNebraska here. He, apparently, wants to offer an amendment. I do not \nwant to delay his opportunity to do that. But I say I am more than \nhappy to cosponsor the amendment of the Senator from Nevada, which does \nnot eliminate the program but simply puts the funding level from $90 \nmillion back to $70 million, where we put it last year.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KERREY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska.\n\n[[Page S8463]]\n\n                           Amendment No. 4978\n\n  (Purpose: To increase funding for the Grain Inspection, Packers and \n Stockyards Administration and the Food Safety and Inspection Service, \n                            with an offset)\n\n  Mr. KERREY. I send an amendment to the desk and ask for its immediate \nconsideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection the pending amendments are \nset aside.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Nebraska [Mr. Kerrey] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 4978.\n\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n       On page 18, line 12, strike ``$432,103,000'' and insert \n     ``$421,078,000''.\n       On page 20, line 10, strike ``$98,000,000'' and insert \n     ``$86,975,000''.\n       On page 23, line 8, strike ``$22,728,000'' and insert \n     ``$24,228,000''.\n       On page 24, line 11, strike ``$557,697,000'' and insert \n     ``$566,222,000''.\n\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, I have brought this problem to the \nattention of both the chairman, the distinguished Senator from \nMississippi, as well as the ranking member, the distinguished Senator \nfrom Arkansas. This amendment would increase funding for the Food \nSafety and Inspection Service as well as for the Grain Inspection, \nPackers and Stockyards Administration, the first by $8.5 million, the \nsecond by $1.5 million. The increases are offset by a reduction in \nfunding available for the Agriculture Quarantine Inspection Program. \nThis is a user fee account within the Animal and Plant Health \nInspection Service.\n  I understand there have been some problems. I understand the \ncommittee has asked the Department of Agriculture, under the FSIS, the \nFood Safety Inspection Service, to give the Congress an evaluation of \nits computer programs. I understand this has just occurred today. But \nwe are now moving, the Department is moving from an old carcass-by-\ncarcass system of evaluating product--which in many cases did not \nimprove the safety of the meat coming out to the consumer because the \ninspection system was not able to apply good science to determine \nwhether or not there were pathogens on the animals--we are moving from \nthat old system to a new system called HACCP. HACCP is, to my mind, a \nvastly preferable system. But it will be very difficult in my judgment \nto do that if we underfund FSIS in the process.\n  Let me say parenthetically, I believe across the board in those areas \nwhere Republicans and Democrats agree the Government function is \nimportant--and there are still some disagreements between Republicans \nand Democrats, or sometimes, as we have just heard, inside, even, each \nparty; sometimes it does not break along party lines, with the Market \nPromotion Program as an example, the Sugar Program and so forth--but in \nmany cases we have reached agreement: The FAA should be funded. FSIS is \nimportant to fund. That increases the quality of our product and the \nconfidence of the consumer. It makes our economy more productive and, \nas a consequence, is a very important function of the Government.\n  Very often we find ourselves in those areas as a result of an \nunwillingness to fund the program because we will not allocate money \nfrom other places. I will make the point again, typically it is not \nthis kind of temporary reallocation, which is all this is, internal to \nUSDA. Very often it is a problem of not being willing to either say we \nare going to raise taxes to pay for it, which very few people at this \npoint want to do, or we are going to get it out of the growth of \nentitlements, or we are not going to build the F-18C, or some other \nthing, some other major program like that.\n  If we do not fund FSIS this year and next year and the year after, as \nthe appropriations accounts get smaller, I believe we are going to pay \na big price for it. So I understand there may be some language that can \nbe worked out in this particular reallocation out of concern for the \nvery specific program I would like to fund, the field automation and \ninformation management project. I have a great deal of respect for the \nchairman and ranking member's concerns for that particular effort.\n  The second thing that is being funded in here is a bit easier and a \nlot more straightforward. That is just a $1.5 additional million for \nthe Grain Inspection, Packers and Stockyards Administration. A lot of \nus have expressed concern this year as the price of beef has gone down. \nOnce again the concern is, is the market working? That is to say, has \nthe concentration in the beef and the concentration of the pork \nindustry reached a point where we no longer have competition, where we \nno longer have price discovery, where we no longer have a market that \nis working to the advantage of either the consumer or for the American \neconomy?\n  That question is a difficult one to answer. Last year there was an \nadvisory committee that was put together. A couple of months ago they \nmade their recommendations to us. The dominant recommendation, at least \nthe recommendation at the top of the list, was we should just do more \nof what the Packer and Stockyards Act says the USDA should do. Even if \nwe are able to get an additional $1.5 million, I must say a $24 or $25 \nmillion budget against the Packer and Stockyards budget, against a \n$120-billion industry, is not likely, even by some sort of commonsense \nevaluation, to provide this agency with enough money to get the job \ndone.\n  For all Members who have issued press releases expressing enthusiasm \nabout this Commission's report, this panel report, this amendment would \nprovide for: An industry structure performance surveillance of \n$550,000--it was in the concentration recommendations; $480,000 for a \npacker market competition study--that, again, was in the recommendation \nthat was made; and a quarter of a million dollars for an electronic \nfiling system, also in the Commission's recommendation.\n  It is impossible for us to be able to go from saying ``we are \nconcerned about whether or not the market is working'' to a point \nwhere, particularly for the smaller packers as well as the great number \nof feedlot operators and growers out there who say ``the market is not \nworking,'' unless we fund this particular agency.\n  Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4979\n\n    (Purpose: To provide funds for risk management, with an offset)\n\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to lay that \namendment aside and move immediately to the consideration of second \namendment I have.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The clerk \nwill report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Nebraska [Mr. Kerrey] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 4979.\n\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n       On page 25, line 16, strike ``$795,000,000'' and insert \n     ``$725,000,000''.\n       On page 29, between lines 7 and 8, insert the following:\n\n                            Risk Management\n\n       For administrative and operating expenses, as authorized by \n     section 226A of the Department of Agriculture Reorganization \n     Act of 1994 (7 U.S.C. 6933), $70,000,000, except that not to \n     exceed $700 shall be available for official reception and \n     representation expenses, as authorized by section 506(i) of \n     the Federal Crop Insurance Act (7 U.S.C. 1506(i)).\n\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, this amendment establishes a separate \nappropriation for salaries and expenses for the Risk Management Agency \ninside the Farm Service Agency's account. I wish the administration of \nthe Department of Agriculture had sent up a separation. I think it is \nclear to most of us who look at the new farm program that increasingly \nit is going to be the farmers managing their own risks that will \ndetermine how well they do in a market that is increasingly volatile. \nThe risk management program, the combination of Government and, \nincreasingly, private sector insurance, is going to determine whether \nor not a producer, a farmer, or small business person out there \noperating in the marketplace, is going to be successful. This\n\n[[Page S8464]]\n\nestablishes this risk management agency and sets up a separate account \nfor it so we make sure the U.S. Department of Agriculture does allocate \na sufficient amount of resources to do so. I pull $70 million out of \nthe FSA to do that. I believe it is much more likely, as a consequence \nof doing this, that the risk management program is going to be executed \nin the fashion that both Republicans and Democrats desire. Again, as we \nlook at this new age of farmers on their own establishing what the risk \nis and purchasing coverage for that risk, it is much more likely, if \nthis agency is funded separately, that the market, the consumer out \nthere, will determine what the nature of that product is going to be \nand that the agency itself will, as a consequence, be sufficiently \nfunded.\n  Mr. President, Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4980\n\n (Purpose: To provide the Secretary of Agriculture temporary authority \n for the use of voluntary separation incentives to assist in reducing \n               employment levels, and for other purposes)\n\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to lay this \npending amendment aside and I ask immediate consideration of a third \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The clerk \nwill report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Nebraska [Mr. Kerrey] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 4980.\n\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The text of the amendment is printed in today's Record under \n``Amendments Submitted.'')\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, this third amendment is one of those sort \nof good Government amendments. I have spoken with the authorizing \ncommittee about this. They raise some concerns that I will attempt to \naddress in a moment. This gives the U.S. Department of Agriculture the \nauthority to conduct a voluntary buyout in order to meet its downsizing \nneeds. No question, under this appropriations bill, the Department of \nAgriculture, particularly in FSA, is going to have to downsize and, \nequally important, Mr. President, no question, that is a desirable \nthing to do, given the substantial reduction in work that is likely to \nbe required under the new farm program.\n  So it is not that I am objecting to that downsizing, I am merely, \nwith this amendment, trying to provide the Department with the \nauthority to do buyouts which very often can save them substantial \nmoney and save the taxpayers substantial money in the process.\n  I note there has been considerable attention to giving buyout \nauthority to other agencies in the Federal Government, Treasury in \nparticular. I am well aware of the work others have done in this area. \nAs indicated, I have had discussions with the authorizing committee--\nthat is to say, the Committee on Governmental Affairs--in gaining \nacceptance for my amendment.\n  Thus, Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be allowed to \namend my amendment before it comes to a vote tomorrow.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays on the third \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. KERREY. I yield the floor.\n\n\n                         fair act credit title\n\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. President, I rise to inquire of my friend, Senator \nLugar of Indiana, about a provision in the Federal Agriculture \nImprovement and Reform Act [FAIR Act] which became law on April 4, \n1996. Specifically, I am concerned with the way the U.S. Department of \nAgriculture has interpreted section 663, the section of the credit \ntitle that provides a transition period for elimination of the \nLeaseback/Buyback program.\n  The statutory language says that only those borrowers who have \nsubmitted complete applications to acquire inventory property prior to \nthe date of enactment will be considered for this form of loan \nservicing. The language is clear that applications must have been fully \nsubmitted on or before April 4, 1996, but a difficulty has arisen with \nregard to whether or not the property--on which the application is \nbeing made--must actually be in Federal inventory prior to the date of \nenactment. The statute is not clear on this point. The Department has \ninterpreted the clause, ``Applications to acquire inventory property,'' \nto mean the property must already be in Federal inventory. This is \ncalled a ``post-acquisition'' application--``acquisition'' referring to \nwhen the Government takes ownership of the property.\n  I am concerned that this ``brightline'' has stranded a number of \n``pre-acquisition'' applicants in the pipeline. These borrowers have \nsubmitted complete applications for leaseback/buyback servicing within \nthe valid timeframe, but for a variety of reasons, the Government has \nnot yet acquired their property.\n  I certainly do understand the desire of the Department to \nexpeditiously resolve as many debt servicing cases as possible. and I \nam supportive of the FAIR Act's marked advances in streamlining the \nfarm loan programs and returning Government to its proper role as a \n``lender of last resort.'' I do believe, however, that we should \ngrandfather those applications that were submitted prior to the change \nin law.\n  I would ask my friend from Indiana whether he agrees with me that \nUSDA's interpretation is incorrect?\n  Mr. LUGAR. Senator Simpson raises a valid issue regarding the \ninterpretation of section 663 of the Federal Agriculture Improvement \nand Reform Act of 1996. Although I disagree with your statement that \nthe statute is not clear on this point, I agree that USDA has \nincorrectly interpreted this section.\n  Section 663 clearly states that a complete application to acquire \ninventory property must have been submitted prior to the date of \nenactment of the FAIR Act. The issue is whether the property in \nquestion has already come into the Government's possession. Until that \ntime, the property should not be deemed inventory property.\n  If a borrower had submitted an application that the Secretary would \nhave deemed complete except that the steps necessary for the Government \nto acquire the property had not been fulfilled, those borrowers' \napplications should be considered complete so that once the property \ndoes enter the Government's inventory, the lease back-buyback agreement \ncan be executed.\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Then you agree that borrowers who had completed \napplications for inventory property that had not yet been acquired by \nthe Government should be grandfathered?\n  Mr. LUGAR. Yes.\n  Mr. SIMPSON. I thank my fine friend for his assistance in this \nmatter.\n\n\n                 Amendments Nos. 4981 and 4982, En Bloc\n\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nfollowing amendments be considered en bloc and agreed to en bloc:\n  The first is offered for the Senator from South Dakota [Mr. \nPressler], dealing with electronic warehouse receipts.\n  The second is offered for the Senator from Oklahoma [Mr. Inhofe], \ndealing with research facilities in Oklahoma of the Agriculture \nResearch Service.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Coverdell). Without objection, it is so \nordered. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Mississippi [Mr. Cochran] proposes \n     amendments numbered 4981 and 4982, en bloc.\n\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendments be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendments are as follows:\n\n\n                           amendment no. 4981\n\n        (Purpose: To improve the issuance of warehouse receipts)\n\n       At the end of the bill, add the following:\n\n     SEC.   . WAREHOUSE RECEIPTS.\n\n       (a) Electronic Warehouse Receipts.--Section 17(c) of the \n     United States Warehouse Act (7 U.S.C. 259(c)) is amended--\n       (1) in paragraph (1)(A), by striking ``cotton'' and \n     inserting ``any agricultural product'';\n       (2) by striking ``the cotton'' each place it appears and \n     inserting ``the agricultural product''; and\n\n[[Page S8465]]\n\n       (3) in paragraph (2)--\n       (A) in subparagraph (A), by striking ``in cotton'' and \n     inserting ``in the agricultural product''; and\n       (B) in the last sentence of subparagraph (B)--\n       (i) by striking ``electronic cotton'' and inserting \n     ``electronic''; and\n       (ii) by striking ``cotton stored in a cotton warehouse'' \n     and inserting ``any agricultural product stored in a \n     warehouse''.\n       (b) Written Receipts.--Section 18(c) of the United States \n     Warehouse Act (7 U.S.C. 260(c)) is amended by striking \n     ``consecutive''.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n\n                           amendment no. 4982\n\n  On page 11, line 22, add the following proviso after the word \n``law'': ``: Provided further, That all rights and title of the United \nStates in the property known as the National Agricultural Water Quality \nLaboratory of the USDA, consisting of approximately 9.161 acres in the \ncity of Durant, Oklahoma, including facilities and fixed equipment, \nshall be conveyed to Southeastern Oklahoma State University.''\n\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, those amendments have been cleared on \nthis side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the amendments are agreed \nto.\n  The amendments (Nos. 4981 and 4982) were agreed to, en bloc.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote by which \nthe amendments were agreed to.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, it appears that Senators who were \nprepared to offer their amendments have come to the floor and offered \nand discussed the amendments that they have to this bill. We understand \nthere are other amendments that Senators would like to offer to this \nbill.\n  I have a list, which I am prepared to read just for the information \nof all Senators. It is obvious we are not going to be able to complete \naction on this bill tonight. We do have amendments that votes have been \nordered on that will occur tomorrow, and during the wrap-up tonight, an \nagreement will be proposed for an order in which those amendments will \nbe taken up and voted on tomorrow.\n  Let me suggest, if Senators can still this evening come to the floor \nto offer their amendments, we are prepared to be here for that purpose.\n  We have this list:\n  Senator Burns, an amendment on barley; Senator Brown, an amendment on \nwater rights; Senator Santorum, who has eight amendments on peanuts; \nSenator Mikulski, an amendment on the Food and Drug Administration; \nSenator Leahy on milk orders; Senator Craig on GAO study on agriculture \nworkers; Senator Lugar on double cropping; Senator Kerrey, which he has \nnow offered, three amendments; Senator Murkowski on seafood inspection; \nSenator Kerrey, another amendment, which he has offered; Senator \nKennedy on Food and Drug Administration; Senator Thurmond on \nagriculture research; Senator Frahm on section 515 rental housing \nprogram; Senator Simpson on wetland easements.\n  We know of no other amendments. We hope those will be the only \namendments, and maybe if Senators will let us know about suggested \nchanges, we may be able to work out accepting some of these amendments \ntonight or when we reconvene on this bill tomorrow.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, I think Senator Pell has a small \namendment that he wants to offer that we probably should add to that \nlist.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. OK.\n  Mr. President, we understand that it will be unlikely that we can get \nan agreement tonight to limit the amendments to those that I have just \nread. We had hoped to be able to get that agreement. We understand, if \nwe propounded that request, there would be an objection. So we will not \npropound a unanimous-consent request, but we hope that will be all the \namendments we will have to this bill, and we will take them up when \nSenators come to the floor to offer them. If they don't come to offer \nthem tonight, we will be here tomorrow.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, to direct a question to the distinguished \nchairman and floor manager, as I understand it, we are going to have a \nwhole slew of votes in the morning on the welfare bill, as many as 20. \nI was wondering if the chairman will be willing to make a unanimous-\nconsent request that immediately following final passage of the welfare \nreform bill tomorrow that we proceed immediately, while the Senators \nare still here on the floor, to a vote on the Gregg amendment and the \nMcCain amendment.\n\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, that will be in the proposed request \nwhich the majority leader will propound. That is an excellent idea. We \nare going to try to include that in the request of the majority leader \nas we wind up business tonight.\n  I am told now the amendment of the Senator from Alaska, Senator \nMurkowski, which we had tried to clear earlier, has now been cleared \nfor adoption.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4983\n\n(Purpose: To reconcile seafood inspection requirements for agricultural \n   commodity programs with those in use for general public consumers)\n\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, with that understanding, I send an \namendment to the desk on behalf of the Senator from Alaska, [Mr. \nMurkowski], on the subject of seafood inspection and ask that it be \nreported.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Mississippi [Mr. Cochran], for Mr. \n     Murkowski, proposes an amendment numbered 4983.\n\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n       Sec.   . Hereafter, notwithstanding any other provision of \n     law, any domestic fish or fish product produced in compliance \n     with food safety standards or procedures accepted by the Food \n     and Drug Administration as satisfying the requirements of the \n     ``Procedures for the Safe and Sanitary Processing and \n     Importing of Fish and Fish Products'' (published by the Food \n     and Drug Administration as a final regulation in the Federal \n     Register of December 18, 1995), shall be deemed to have met \n     any inspection requirements of the Department of Agriculture \n     or other Federal agency for any Federal commodity purchase \n     program, including the program authorized under section 32 of \n     the Act of August 24, 1935 (7 U.S.C. 612c) except that the \n     Department of Agriculture or other Federal agency may utilize \n     lot inspection to establish a reasonable degree of certainty \n     that fish or fish products purchased under a Federal \n     commodity purchase program, including the program authorized \n     under section 32 of the Act of August 24, 1935 (7 U.S.C. \n     612c), meet Federal product specifications.\n\n  Mr. BUMPERS. There is no objection on this side, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the amendment is agreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 4983) was agreed to.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote by which \nthe amendment was agreed to.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I also understand that Senator Hatch is \ngoing to propose an amendment on the subject of generic drugs.

This report is submitted pursuant to section 401(c) of \nthe National Emergencies Act, 50 U.S. 1641(c); section 204(c) of the \nInternational Emergency Economic Powers Act (``IEEPA''), 50 U.S.C. \n1703(c); and section 505(c) of the International Security and \nDevelopment Cooperation Act of 1985, 22 U.S.C. 2349aa-9(c).\n  1. On January 3, 1996, I renewed for another year the national \nemergency with respect to Libya pursuant to IEEPA. This renewal \nextended the current comprehensive financial and trade embargo against \nLibya in effect since 1986. Under these sanctions, all trade with Libya \nis prohibited, and all assets owned or controlled by the Libyan \ngovernment in the United States or in the possession or control of U.S. \npersons are blocked.\n  2. There have been no amendments to the Libyan Sanctions Regulations, \n31 C.F.R. Part 550 (the ``Regulations''), administered by the Office of \nForeign Assets Control (OFAC) of the Department of the Treasury, since \nmy last report on January 22, 1996.\n  3. During the current 6-month period, OFAC reviewed numerous \napplications for licenses to authorize transactions under the \nRegulations. Consistent with OFAC's ongoing scrutiny of banking \ntransactions, the largest category of license approvals (91) concerned \nrequests by non-Libyan persons or entities to unblock transfers \ninterdicted because of what appeared to be Government of Libya \ninterests. Three licenses were issued for the expenditure of funds and \nacquisition of goods and services in the United States by or on behalf \nof accredited persons and athletes of Libya in connection with \nparticipation in the 1996 Paralympic Games. One license was issued to \nauthorize a U.S. company to initiate litigation against an entity of \nthe Government of Libya.\n  4. During the current 6-month period, OFAC continued to emphasize to \nthe international banking community in the United States the importance \nof identifying and blocking payments made by or on behalf of Libya. The \nOffice worked closely with the banks to assure the effectiveness of \ninterdiction software systems used to identify such payments. During \nthe reporting period, more than 129 transactions potentially involving \nLibya were interdicted, with an additional $7 million held blocked as \nof May 15.\n  5. Since my last report, OFAC collected eight civil monetary \npenalties totaling more than $51,000 for violations of the U.S. \nsanctions against Libya. Two of the violations involved the failure of \nbanks to block funds transfers to Libyan-owned or Libyan-controlled \nbanks. Two other penalties were received from corporations for export \nviolations, including one received as part of a plea agreement before a \nU.S. district judge. Four additional penalties were paid by U.S. \ncitizens engaging in Libyan oilfield-related transactions while another \n30 cases involving similar violations are in active penalty processing.\n  On February 6, 1996, a jury sitting in the District of Connecticut \nfound two Connecticut businessmen guilty on charges of false \nstatements, conspiracy, and illegally diverting U.S.-origin technology \nto Libya between 1987 and 1993 in violation of U.S. sanctions. On May \n22, 1996, a major manufacturer of farm and construction equipment \nentered a guilty plea in the United States District Court for the \nEastern District of Wisconsin for Libyan sanctions violations. A three-\ncount information charged the company with aiding and abetting the sale \nof construction equipment and parts from a foreign affiliate to Libya. \nThe company paid $1,810,000 in criminal fines and $190,000 in civil \npenalties. Numerous investigations carried over from prior reporting \nperiods are continuing and new reports of violations are being pursued.\n\n  6. The expenses incurred by the Federal Government in the 6-month \nperiod from January 6 through July 6, 1996, that are directly \nattributable to the exercise of powers and authorities conferred by the \ndeclaration of the Libyan national emergency are estimated at \napproximately $733,000. Personnel costs were largely centered in the \nDepartment of the Treasury (particularly in the Office of Foreign \nAssets Control, the Office of the General Counsel, and the U.S. Customs \nService), the Department of State, and the Department of Commerce.\n  7. The policies and actions of the Government of Libya continue to \npose an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security and \nforeign policy of the United States. In adopting United Nations \nSecurity Council Resolution 883 in November 1993, the Security Council \ndetermined that the continued failure of the Government of Libya to \ndemonstrate by concrete actions its renunciation of terrorism, and in \nparticular its continued failure to respond fully and effectively to \nthe requests and decisions of the Security Council in Resolutions 731 \nand 748, concerning the bombing of the Pan Am 103 and UTA 772 flights, \nconstituted a threat to international peace and security. The United \nStates will continue to coordinate its comprehensive sanctions \nenforcement efforts with those of other U.N. member states. We remain \ndetermined to ensure that the perpetrators of the terrorist acts \nagainst Pan Am 103 and UTA 772 are brought to justice. The families of \nthe victims in the murderous Lockerbie bombing and other acts of Libyan \nterrorism deserve nothing less. I shall continue to exercise the powers \nat my disposal to apply economic sanctions against Libya fully and \neffectively, so long as those measures are appropriate, and will \ncontinue to report periodically to the Congress on significant \ndevelopments as required by law.\n                                                  William J. Clinton.  \n  The White House, July 22, 1996.\n\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/07/22/senate-section/article/S8466-3", "month": "07", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "22", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8467]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n[[Page S8467]]\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 4 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered by \nMr. Hays, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House agrees to \nthe amendment of the Senate to the bill (H.R. 497) to create the \nNational Gambling Impact and Policy Commission.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/07/22/senate-section/article/S8467-1", "month": "07", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "22", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8467-S8468]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   EXECUTIVE AND OTHER COMMUNICATIONS\n\n  The following communications were laid before the Senate, together \nwith accompanying papers, reports, and documents, which were referred \nas indicated:\n\n       EC-3479.

A bill to establish an Emergency Commission To End the Trade \nDeficit; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n                     THE END THE TRADE DEFICIT ACT\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I am pleased today to come to the floor \nwith my colleague and friend, Senator Byrd from West Virginia, to \nintroduce a piece of legislation that we feel is important and timely. \nIt is a piece of legislation that we have discussed for many months and \nare now prepared to introduce in the hope that we would be able to do \nthe things necessary to allow it to become law between now and the end \nof this legislative session.\n  Simply put, this piece of legislation deals with a deficit. There has \nbeen a great deal of discussion in the Congress in recent years about \ndeficits, almost all of it dealing with the question of budget \ndeficits. Those deficits are a problem and have been a problem, and we \nhave tried in a number of ways, both on the Democratic side and on the \nRepublican side, in different kinds of approaches, to bring down the \nbudget deficit.\n  I am pleased to say a substantial amount has been accomplished. The \nbudget deficit has been reduced almost in half in the last 3 to 4 \nyears. The budget deficit is down and is coming down. In fact, a report \njust last week by the Congressional Budget Office was an \nextraordinarily optimistic report about further reductions in the \nbudget deficit.\n  However, there is another deficit that almost no one speaks about. It \nis called the merchandise trade deficit, and it is growing and getting \nlarger. We are going to introduce a piece of legislation today that \nestablishes a commission. It asks that an emergency commission to end \nthe trade deficit be impaneled to review economic and trade policies, \ntax and investment laws and other incentive and restrictions that \naffect trade, with the hope that recommendations can be made that \nCongress will be able to embrace to not only reduce this trade deficit \nbut also to end the trade deficit.\n  I will offer a couple of charts to show my colleagues what has \nhappened with respect to the trade deficit. We have had 20 consecutive \nyears of trade deficits, totaling $1.8 trillion. Last year, we had the \nlargest negative trade balance in history. This chart shows, and the \nred demonstrates, the merchandise trade deficit.\n  These are troublesome because trade deficits must be repaid with a \nlower standard of living in the United States. You can make a more \ndirect case on national budget deficits. That is money people owe to \nthemselves, and except for the maldistribution of the debt, it is not \nsuch a big deal. I do not make that case on the trade deficit, but some \neconomists might. Nobody can make a case with respect to the trade \ndeficit, except this: Trade deficits must be and will be repaid by a \nlower standard of living in this country. And they must be repaid \nsomeday.\n  This chart shows what has happened to the trade deficits. There has \nbeen very little discussion in the Congress about what is causing the \ntrade deficit, in what direction it is headed, and how to begin to \ndevelop some policies to address it.\n  The trade deficit also represents some other underlying problems. \nThese deficits mean that we are buying more from abroad than we are \nselling to other countries. It means that jobs that normally would have \nbeen created in our country are created elsewhere. It means jobs are \nmoving from our country to foreign countries. Less opportunity here, \nmore opportunity abroad.\n  When you see these kinds of policies that inherently weaken our \nmanufacturing base and sap our economic strength, you have to be \nprepared to say that this is a serious problem for this country. We \nmust address it. Just as we have been addressing the other deficit, the \nbudget deficit, so, too, we must address this issue of 20 years of \ngrowing merchandise trade deficits.\n  The next chart is a chart that shows that projections by econometric \nfirms and forecasting firms tell us that the trend line by Data \nResources indicates that the merchandise trade deficit will reach over \n$330 billion by the year 2006, 10 years from now. Wharton Econometrics \nprojects a doubling of the trade deficit by the year 2010.\n  These are the forecasting groups who say, ``Here is what we think \nwill happen to the merchandise trade deficit.'' They see a doubling of \nthe trade deficit. This is Data Resources: $331 billion by the year \n2006. Clearly, that is a course that this country should not accept. \nClearly, we ought to do something about it.\n  The next chart. The United States, in a very few short years, has \nmoved from being in the position of the world's largest creditor Nation \nto being the world's largest debtor Nation. That has happened in a very \nshort period of time. This is an astounding change in our country's \neconomic position.\n  Now, think of this as a neighborhood, and you look at one house over \nnear a driveway with very nice shutters, a manicured lawn, a pretty \nhome, with five or six cars sitting outside in the driveway. You think \nto yourself, gee, that person is really doing well--except the person \nis very close to going under, because it is all borrowed money. That is \nwhat is happening with our merchandise trade deficit, and why we are \ngoing from the largest creditor Nation in the world to being the \nlargest debtor Nation in the world.\n  The next chart I want to show describes our trade deficit by country. \nYou will see the largest trade deficit, by far, is with Japan. We have \nhad this for a long while. It is continuing and abiding and does not \nseem to change. It was nearly $60 billion last year. China was $34 \nbillion. Canada and Mexico together were about $33 billion. A very \nsubstantial problem. Six countries make up 94 percent of our country's \ntrade deficit.\n  Now, part of the problem is that these countries have not completely \nopened up their borders to our goods. Yet, they ship their goods to our \ncountry in wholesale quantities. When we want to move goods into their \ncountries, we are told that we are doing better. But we are not doing \ngood enough\n\n[[Page S8469]]\n\nbecause our manufacturers, businesses, and workers cannot get our \nproducts into those countries on nearly the same basis as they move \ntheir products into our country.\n  One common myth with respect to this trade issue is that what we are \nimporting into this country is really the product of cheap labor, and \nthat low-skill, cheap labor products are being sent into this country. \nNot true. Not true at all. Seventy-five percent of what the U.S. \nimports are high-tech and value-added manufactured goods: Automobiles, \nautomobile parts, electronics, office machines, telecommunications. \nThat is what is coming into our country. It is not trinkets produced \nwith low-wage labor. Rather, it is high-tech, value-added manufactured \ngoods.\n\n  I want to show one additional chart that describes that in the past \n25 years the imports of manufactured goods into our country has risen \nand risen and risen. Today it is at the point where imports now equal \n56 percent of our manufacturing capacity. That means imports today are \nequal to over one-half of our domestic manufacturing capacity.\n  No wonder the purchasing power of hourly and weekly wages in this \ncountry for the vast majority of working Americans are back down to \nlevels, in some cases, in constant dollars, to the 1950's and 1960's. \nThat kind of downward pressure means fewer jobs in this country, and \nthe jobs that exist in the manufacturing sector pay less and have less \nsecurity.\n  Now, if you take this trade deficit and calculate it with respect to \nthe common calculations about jobs, they talk about 20,000 jobs per $1 \nbillion in exports. If we export $1 billion worth of American goods, \nthey say that means we created 20,000 additional jobs. If you would use \nthe same formula, it should be equally true that, for $1 billion worth \nof imports, someone else had the 20,000 jobs and we did not. That means \nthat last year's trade deficit represents a loss of somewhere around \n3.5 million good jobs. Just the increase in that trade deficit from \n1994 to 1995 would mean a loss of 166,000 jobs.\n  What we propose today--Senator Byrd and myself, and, hopefully, \nothers who will join us--would be an emergency commission to end the \ntrade deficit. We would propose that this commission review five broad \nareas of trade policy concerns: The manner in which the Government \nestablishes and administers our fundamental trade policies and \nobjectives, No. 1; No. 2, the causes and consequences of the \npersistence and the growth of the overall trade deficit, as well as the \nbilateral trade deficits; No. 3, the relationship of U.S. trade \ndeficits to the competitive and comparative advantages within the \nglobal economy; No. 4, the relationship between the growth of direct \ninvestment both into and out of the United States and the trade \ndeficit; finally, No. 5, the development of policies and alternative \nstrategies to achieve a systematic reduction of the trade deficit and, \nhopefully, an end to the trade deficit.\n  This would be an 11-member commission. It would have 16 months to \npresent its report to Congress and the President. We do this today \nbecause we think it is time--probably past the time--to be thinking of \nwhat these trade deficits and what the projections of where the trade \ndeficits are going to go will mean to this country.\n  As I conclude, Mr. President, I want to make a point. I am honored to \nhave Senator Byrd join me in this endeavor, and I hope very much that, \nby the end of this year, this will be law and we will have a commission \nto evaluate this and make recommendations to the Congress.\n  The minute someone comes to the floor of the Senate and begins \ntalking about trade and talking about trade deficits, two things \nhappen: One, people start to yawn. They say, ``Well, this is so boring. \nIt is uninteresting.'' They do not want to talk about it. Or, two, they \nimmediately rise on their haunches, and say, ``Well, what you are is \nsomeone who wants to close America's borders; you are some kind of a \nisolationist; a xenophobic stooge who doesn't understand the \ncomplexities of international trade.''\n  I do not want to close America's borders. I want more trade--not less \ntrade. I want expanded opportunity for American products and workers. \nBut I want to finally make sure that we reduce and finally eliminate \nthe trade deficit, and have some balance in trade by deciding that it \nis important that America shall not be taken advantage of in \ninternational trade.\n  For 50 years our trade policy was our foreign policy. And we would do \nthis and that and the other thing to help various countries as a matter \nof foreign policy. Lets look at the first 25 of those 50 years. Let's \nlook at income in this country for workers. After all, that is what \nreally matters. At the end of the day have we increased the standard of \nliving for the American worker and the American family. If you look at \nthe first 25 of those 50 years their incomes went steadily upward \nbecause we had a trade policy that was really just foreign policy and \nwe still beat everybody else in the world with one hand tied behind our \nback. In the first 25 years, incomes went steadily upward with an \nincreasing standard of living. What about the second 25 years. Look at \nthe graph. What you will see is a steady diminution of income and \nsecurity for American workers.\n  Often people sit around their supper table talking about their lot in \nlife. They are working harder and working more hours. More people in \nthe family are working. And, adjusted for inflation, they are making \nthe same or less than they were 20 years ago.\n  The fact is we must do something to try to strengthen and maintain a \nstrong manufacturing base in this country. And the circumstances that \nrelate to this chronic and growing trade deficit tend to undermine \nAmerica's manufacturing capability. No country--none--will ever remain \na world economic power unless it retains its manufacturing base. That \nis what is slowly eroding and being washed away by these chronic, \ntroublesome trade deficits.\n  Senator Byrd and I do not propose solutions or strategies that would \nhave us withdraw from the global economy, or have us retreat from the \nworld trade system. But we do insist it is in this country's best \ninterest to achieve a balance of trade and to end these chronic trade \ndeficits that injure our country's well-being and lead to a decreased \nstandard of living in America.\n  Mr. President, the future of our Nation is being undermined by a \nproblem that simply is not getting adequate attention or concern. There \nare those who do not even acknowledge that it is a problem, despite the \nfact it has reached record proportions.\n  Our Nation's trade deficit is one of the twin deficits that this \ncountry must address. Today the trade deficit is the larger twin, yet \nmost of our attention is still focused on the Federal budget deficit. \nWe need to solve these twin deficit problems, because together and \nindividually they are threatening the economic security of Americans.\n  Today I am introducing legislation to address this crucial problem. \nThe End the Trade Deficit Act will establish a commission to develop \nplans to end the trade deficit in the next 10 years, and establish a \ncompetitive trade policy for the 21st century which will not only \nincrease production and manufacturing in our country, but also job \nopportunities, and wages.\n  Just as balancing the budget has come to represent the need to take a \nmore disciplined approach to deciding our national priorities, our goal \nin ending the trade deficit must be to develop a more disciplined \napproach in deciding and carrying out our Nation's trade policies.\n  Our trade deficit is symptomatic of larger economic conditions and \nquestions that must be addressed. My purpose in this legislation is not \nsimply to get rid of the red figures at the bottom of our trade ledger. \nInstead, it is to help develop the national economic and trade \nstrategies which will rebuild the American economy and the American \ndream.\n\n\n                        Growth of Trade Deficit\n\n  Many economists predicted that our trade deficit would disappear as \nwe reduced our Nation's budget deficit. That is not what is happening. \nThe fact is that in the past few years we are bringing down our budget \ndeficit. Yet, we have recorded back to back record merchandise trade \ndeficits during the past 2 years. Our budget deficit is going down \nwhile our trade deficit continues to grow.\n  Last year, the United States experienced its 20th consecutive annual \nmerchandise trade deficit. During these\n\n[[Page S8470]]\n\npast two decades we have piled up a total merchandise trade deficit of \n$1.8 trillion.\n  The trend line in the growth of this deficit should be of great \nconcern to the American people. Last year we had the largest negative \nmerchandise trade balance in the history of the United States. The $175 \nbillion merchandise trade deficit was larger than the $164 billion \nfederal budget deficit.\n  An econometric forecasting firm, Data Resources, Inc., is projecting \nthat our Nation's merchandise trade deficit will continue to grow \nreaching new records in the next few years. Based on long-term trends, \nData Resources is forecasting that the merchandise trade deficit can be \nexpected to almost double during the next 10 years to $331 billion. \nWharton Econometrics is forecasting that the U.S. merchandise trade \ndeficit will double by the year 2010.\n  As a result of our twin deficits, the United States has shifted from \nbeing the world's largest creditor nation to the world's largest debtor \nnation. Our country has gone from a net creditor position of over $250 \nbillion in the early 1980's to a net debtor position of over three-\nquarters of a trillion dollars by the mid-1990's. The positive net \ninternational asset position that we had built up over the past 100 \nyears was eliminated in a short 6-year period during the 1980's.\n  We used to earn $30 billion annually on our international assets. Now \nwe are paying something in the neighborhood of $11 billion to service \nthis international debt.\n\n\n                      Importance of Trade Deficit\n\n  The persistence and growth of our trade deficit is not just a concern \nof academics and ivory tower economists. It is a question of fair trade \nand fair competition. It is an issue of American jobs and the \npurchasing power of American wage earners. It is a matter of what \nopportunities we will have for our future.\n  Today the bulk of the products that we import are not labor-intensive \ngoods. Instead our merchandise trade deficit consists primarily of \nhigh-technology, manufactured items. Autos, office equipment, \nelectronic goods, and telecommunications equipment make up three-\nfourths of the imports.\n  Imports of manufactured goods have increased from 11 percent of the \ntotal U.S. manufacturing gross product to over 50 percent. This means \nthat rather than expanding our own manufacturing base in this country, \nwe are importing more of our manufactured goods from abroad. It means \nthat we are shipping jobs overseas.\n  The bottom line is that we are shifting from a manufacturing, \nproduction-based economy with high wages, to a service-based economy \nwith low wages. No wonder the purchasing power of hourly and weekly \nwages of the vast majority of working Americans are back down to levels \nwe haven't seen since the 1950's and 1960's.\n\n  Together with the record merchandise trade deficit this past year, \nthe value of the U.S. dollar fell to its weakest level in history. Yet, \ndespite the weakening dollar, our trade deficit has continued to mount.\n  Neither the American consumer nor the American economy is making any \nlong-term gains by the continuing trade deficit and the devaluation of \nthe dollar. Instead, they represent an erosion of both our sovereignty \nand our economy.\n\n\n                        Causes of Trade Deficits\n\n  Our merchandise trade deficit is a result of a serious trade \nimbalances with a handful of countries. Six countries comprise 94 \npercent of the U.S. merchandise trade deficit. This includes Japan, \nChina, Canada, Mexico, Germany, and Taiwan. Over one-half this trade \ndeficit is with only two countries: Japan and China.\n  Our trade relationships are most accurately described as unilateral \nfree trade. As a nation we have opened our borders wide open to almost \nanything and everything that can be produced anywhere. Unfortunately we \npay little attention to the conditions under which these goods have \nbeen produced or if the competition is fair.\n  At the same while the United States has one of the most open borders \nand open economies in the world, this Nation faces significant barriers \nin shipping American goods abroad. As a result, these negative trade \nbalances do not reflect the actual competitiveness or the productivity \nof the American economy. Yet, there is no question that we are one of \nthe most competitive economies in the world.\n  Instead most of our bilateral trade deficits effectively illustrate \nthe barriers that continue to exist despite hundreds of new trade \nagreements in recent years. As documented annually in the reports of \nthe Office of the U.S. Trade Representative reciprocal market access \nremains an elusive goal.\n\n\n                        Ending the Trade Deficit\n\n  As a nation we need to bring the same attention and the same \ncommitment to working on the trade deficit that we are giving to \nreducing our budget deficit.\n  It has been a quarter of a century since the last comprehensive \nreview of national trade and investment policies was conducted by a \nPresidential commission. In these past 25 years we have had only 3 \nyears in which the United States has had trade surpluses.\n  We have witnessed massive worldwide economic and political changes in \nthe past 25 years. These changes have profoundly affected world trading \nrelationships.\n  The cold war has ended. It is no longer necessary or even prudent for \nU.S. trade policy to take a back seat to our foreign policy objectives.\n  Regional trade relationships including the European Union and the \nNorth American Free Trade Agreement are redefining political, economic, \nand trading geography. The Uruguay round of negotiations under the \nGeneral Agreement on Tariffs and Trade has resulted in the creation of \nthe World Trade Organization.\n  Globalization is part and parcel of the increased mobility of capital \nand technology that is reshaping comparative and competitive advantages \namong nations of the world.\n  While other nations and many multinational companies are enjoying the \nfruits of globalization, the United States is not realizing the full \nopportunities or benefits of its competitive capacity and productivity.\n  Unilateral free trade no longer serves the interests of the American \npeople, if it ever did. We need fair rules and reciprocal market access \nif our competitive economy is to thrive within a global system. I am \nnot calling for trade restrictions. Rather I am calling for expanded \ntrade, but with rules that are fair.\n\n\n                          Emergency Commission\n\n  The United States is once again at a critical juncture in trade \npolicy development. The persistence and growth of the trade deficit \nmust be reversed. We must identify the causes and consequences of our \ntrade deficit.\n  Rather than allowing our trade deficit to double during the next 10 \nyears, we need to develop a plan which would end the trade deficit in \nthat time period. That is why I am introducing a bill with Senator Byrd \ntoday to establish an Emergency Commission To End the Trade Deficit.\n  The purpose of this Commission is to develop a comprehensive trade \nstrategy to eliminate the merchandise trade deficit by the year 2006 \nand to develop a competitive trade policy for the 21st century.\n  The bill directs the Commission to develop the necessary strategies \nto achieve a trade balance that fully reflects the competitiveness and \nproductivity of the U.S. economy while improving the standard of living \nfor the people of this country.\n  It would require the Commission to examine our national economic \npolicies, trade laws, tax laws, investment policies, and all the other \nlegal incentives and restrictions that are relevant to the trading \nposition of this country.\n  The Commission would look at five broad areas:\n  First, the manner in which the Government of the United States \nestablishes and administers the Nation's fundamental trade policies and \nobjectives.\n  Second, the causes and consequences of the persistence and growth of \nthe overall trade deficit, as well as our bilateral trade deficits.\n  Third, the relationship of U.S. trade deficits to the competitive and \ncomparative advantages within the global economy.\n  Fourth, the relationship between investment flows, both into and out \nof the United States, and the trade deficit.\n  Fifth, the identification and evaluation of policies and alternative \nstrategies by which the United States can\n\n[[Page S8471]]\n\nachieve the systematic reduction of the trade deficit and the \nimprovement of the economic well being of its people.\n  This Commission would consist of a blue-ribbon panel of leaders from \na broad spectrum of the economic life of our Nation. The members would \nbe appointed by the President and the leadership of Congress. They \nwould be given the responsibility to study the situation, gather \nnecessary data, conduct at least seven public hearings, and evaluate \nstrategies to end the trade deficit.\n  The Commission would be required to present its final report not \nlater than 16 months following the enactment of this bill. The final \nreport would outline its findings and conclusions, and provide a \ndetailed plan for reducing our Nation's trade deficits together with \nrecommendations on administrative and legislative actions that may be \nrequired to achieve that goal.\n  The Commission's report would be submitted to the President and the \nCongress for review, consideration, and implementation. To facilitate \nthe Commission's report through Congress, this bill would have the \nHouse Ways and Means Committee and the Senate Finance Committee conduct \nhearings on the report within 6 months after it is submitted to \nCongress.\n\n\n                            Time for Change\n\n  Today it is apparent that we do not have a consensus about where we \nshould go with our national trade policies. We are not even sure \nwhether we have the necessary tools to effectively achieve our trade \ngoals.\n  Most importantly, we do not have a good set of alternatives and \nstrategies to place before the American people so that they can \neffectively participate in making the decisions that are shaping their \nfuture.\n  It is time to develop a new trade strategy for the twenty-first \ncentury. We can get started on this path by making our first goal to \nend the trade deficit. Once we have set that goal, then we need the \nstrategies to get there. That is why I believe it is time for such a \ncommission.\n  I am pleased that Senator Robert Byrd is cosponsoring this \nlegislation. I hope others will join us in this effort and look forward \nto working with them in moving forward on this critically important \nagenda for our future.\n  Mr. President, let me now yield the floor. The Senator from West \nVirginia under the unanimous-consent agreement would also like to \naddress the piece of legislation that we will introduce in the Senate \ntoday.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, how much of the 30 minutes are remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 18 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that should I need \nan additional 5 minutes under the same terms and conditions that I be \nallowed to have that time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I am pleased to join with the very \ndistinguished Senator from North Dakota in introducing an ambitious new \neffort on the matter of our nation's persistent and growing trade \ndeficit. This legislation--as the distinguished Senator has already \nexplained--would establish a Commission to take a broad, thorough look \nat all important aspects of trends involving, and solutions to, the \ngrowing U.S. trade deficit, with particular attention to the \nmanufacturing sector.\n  The trade deficit, as my colleagues know, is a recent phenomenon, \nwith large annual deficits only occurring within the last 15 years, or \nso, as my colleague has explained. Between 1970 and 1995, the U.S. \nmerchandise trade balance shifted from a surplus of $3.2 billion to a \ndeficit of $159.6 billion. It did not reach sizeable levels until it \njumped up to $52 billion in 1983. As my colleague has suggested, \nprojections by econometric forecasting firms indicate long term trends \nwill bring this figure to $300 billion or more within the next 10 \nyears. No one is predicting a decline in the near future. And this is \nbad news. Thus, unless we act, our trade deficit will soon exceed our \nannual appropriations for the Department of Defense.\n  This legislation is committed to a goal of reversing that 10-year \ntrend. The goal of the commission is to ``develop a national economic \nplan to systematically reduce the U.S. trade deficit and to achieve a \nmerchandise trade balance by the year 2006.''\n  While it is not clear what the particular reasons for this growing \ntrade deficit may be, nor what the long term impacts of a persistently \ngrowing deficit may be, the time is overdue for a detailed examination \nof the factors causing the deficit. We need to understand the impacts \nof it on specific industrial and manufacturing sectors. Furthermore, we \nneed to identify the gaps that exist in our data bases and economic \nmeasurements to adequately understand the specific nature of the \nimpacts of the deficit on such important things as our manufacturing \ncapacity and the integrity of our industrial base, on productivity, \njobs and wages in specific sectors.\n  We debate the trade deficits frequently. Both Senator Dorgan and I \nhave participated in these debates. I voted against NAFTA. I voted \nagainst GATT, and for good reasons which are becoming clearer.\n\n  So we debate these deficits frequently. We moan about them. We groan \nabout them. We complain about them. But if we do not understand the \nnature, impacts and long term vulnerabilities that such manufacturing \nimbalances create in our economy and standard of living, we are in the \ndark. It appears to me that debate over trade matters too often takes \non the form of lofty rhetorical bombast of so-called ``protectionists'' \nversus so-called ``free traders.'' But I would suggest that neither \nside knows enough about what is really transpiring in our economy, \ngiven the very recent nature of these annual persistent deficits.\n  Certainly we know that the deficit reflects on the ability of \nAmerican business to compete abroad. We want to be competitive. \nCertainly we know that specific deficits with specific trading partners \ncauses frictions between the United States and those friends and \nallies. This is particularly the case with Japanese, as we are well \naware, and is becoming quickly the case with China. It is clear that \nthe trade deficit has contributed to the depreciation of the dollar and \nthe ability of Americans to afford foreign products and American \nproducts as well. Less clear, but of vital importance, is the \nrelationship of the trade deficit to other important policy questions \non the table between the United States and our foreign trading \npartners. Attempts by the United States to reduce tariff and non-tariff \nbarriers in the Japan and China markets, which clearly restrict access \nof U.S. goods to those markets, have been crippled by the intervention \nof other, more important policy goals.\n  During the cold war, the U.S.-Japan security relationship had a \nsevere dampening effect on our efforts to reduce the myriad barriers in \nJapan to U.S. exports. The same effect appears to have resulted from \nour need for the Japanese to participate in our treasury bill auctions. \nThis becomes a closed cycle--the need to finance the trade deficit with \nforeign capital, resulting in regular involvement of the Japanese \ngovernment in our treasury bill auctions, seems to dampen our efforts \nto push the Japanese on market opening arrangements. Naturally, without \nreciprocal open markets, the trade imbalance remains exaggerated \nbetween the U.S. and Japan, prompting further need for Japanese \nfinancial support to fund our national debt. Thus, some argue that the \nneed for Japanese involvement in financing our national debt hurts the \nability of our trade negotiators to get stronger provisions in the \ndispute settled last year over the Japanese market for auto parts.\n\n  Similar considerations appear to prevail in negotiating market access \nwith the Chinese in the area of Intellectual Property rights. While our \nTrade Negotiator managed a laudable, very specific agreement with the \nChinese last year in this area, the Chinese were derelict in \nimplementing it, leading to another high-wire negotiation this year to \navoid $2 billion of trade sanctions on the Chinese, and to get the \nChinese to implement the accord as they had promised. Again, it is \nunclear whether the Chinese will now follow through in a consistent \nmanner with the implementing mechanisms for the Intellectual Property \nagreement belatedly agreed to in the latest negotiation. Intellectual \nProperty is an area of great potential for U.S. exports to China. The \nChinese have promised major action against piracy of CD's, movies, and \nother products, and to permit co-\n\n[[Page S8472]]\n\nproduction of audiovisual products and joint ventures regarding \nartists. This is a major test case of our ability to obtain appropriate \naccess to the great Chinese market. We need to monitor it carefully. \nThe highly trumpeted mantra about how the U.S.-China relationship will \nbe one of the most important, if not the most important, U.S. bilateral \nrelationship for the next half century, has a chilling effect on \ninsisting on fair, reciprocal treatment, and good faith implementation \nof agreements signed with the Chinese government.\n  It will only be when we truly understand the specific impacts of this \nlarge deficit on our economy, particularly our industrial and \nmanufacturing base, that the importance of insisting on fair play on \nthe trade account will become clear.\n  Finally, the legislation being introduced by the distinguished \nSenator from North Dakota, [Mr. Dorgan], requires the Commission to \nexamine alternative strategies which we can pursue to achieve the \nsystematic reduction of the deficit, particularly how to retard the \nmigration of our manufacturing base abroad, and the changes that might \nbe needed to our basic trade agreements and practices.\n  These are the purposes of the Commission that Senator Dorgan and I \nare proposing in this legislation. And I join with him in welcoming \nother Senators to cosponsor this legislation.\n  We can either continue to blunder along without a clear sense of the \nimportance of the U.S. manufacturing base or of how to protect and \nenlarge upon that base or we can begin now to gather the data that will \nlead us in the right direction for the future of U.S. trade policy.\n  In other words, we can put up the right fences now or deal with a \nvery sick economy and an ever-spiraling trade deficit which may take \nour economy right over a very dangerous cliff in the years ahead.\n  Mr. President, there is an old poem that was written by Joseph Malins \nmany years ago which I think aptly describes the situation we are in.\n\n                         Fence or an Ambulance\n\n     `Twas a dangerous cliff, as they freely confessed,\n     Though to walk near its crest was so pleasant;\n     But over its terrible edge there had slipped\n     A duke and full many a peasant.\n     So the people said something would have to be done,\n     But their projects did not at all tally;\n     Some said, ``Put a fence around the edge of the cliff,''\n     Some, ``An ambulance down in the valley.''\n\n     But the cry for the ambulance carried the day,\n     For it spread through the neighboring city;\n     A fence may be useful or not, it is true,\n     But each heart became brimful of pity\n     For those who slipped over that dangerous cliff;\n     And the dwellers in highway and alley\n     Gave pounds or gave pence, not to put up a fence,\n     But an ambulance down in the valley.\n\n     ``For the cliff is all right, if you're careful,'' they said,\n     ``And, if folks even slip and are dropping,\n     It isn't the slipping that hurts them so much,\n     As the shock down below when they're stopping.''\n     So day after day, as these mishaps occurred,\n     Quick forth would these rescuers sally\n     To pick up the victims who fell off the cliff,\n     With their ambulance down in the valley.\n     Then an old sage remarked: ``It's a marvel to me\n     That people give far more attention\n     To repairing results than to stopping the cause,\n     When they'd much better aim at prevention.\n     Let us stop at its source all this mischief,'' cried he,\n     ``Come, neighbors and friends, let us rally;\n     If the cliff we will fence we might almost dispense\n     With the ambulance down in the valley.''\n\n     ``Oh, he's a fanatic,'' the others rejoined,\n     ``Dispense with the ambulance? Never!\n     He'd dispense with all charities, too, if he could;\n     No! No! We'll support them forever.\n     Aren't we picking up folks just as fast as they fall?\n     And shall this man dictate to us? Shall he?\n     Why should people of sense stop to put up a fence,\n     While the ambulance works in the valley''\n\n     But a sensible few, who are practical too,\n     Will not bear with such nonsense much longer;\n     They believe that prevention is better than cure,\n     And their party will soon be the stronger.\n     Encourage them then, with your purse, voice, and pen,\n     And while other philanthropists dally,\n     They will scorn all pretense and put up a stout fence\n     On the cliff that hangs over the valley.\n     Better guide well the young than reclaim them when old,\n     For the voice of true wisdom is calling,\n     ``To rescue the fallen is good, but `tis best\n     To prevent other people from falling.''\n     Better close up the source of temptation and crime\n     Than deliver from dungeon or galley;\n     Better put a strong fence round the top of the cliff\n     Than an ambulance down in the valley.\n\n  I commend the Senator from North Dakota for his studious approach to \nthis question and for choosing the route of prevention over the \nambulance down in the valley. I am pleased to join him in offering this \nproposal for the consideration of the Senate, and I hope that many of \nour colleagues will join us, and that we can secure passage of the \nproposal before the 104th Congress adjourns sine die this fall.\n  Mr. President, I thank my colleague for his courtesy in allowing me \nto join in cosponsoring this very important legislation. I thank him \nfor his courtesy in securing the time on this day and for his yielding \nto me that I might add to the record. I yield the floor.\n  I yield back such time as I may have.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. JEFFORDS:\n  S. 1979. A bill to amend the Social Security Act to help disabled \nindividuals become economically self-sufficient and eligible for health \ncare coverage through work incentives and a medicare buy-in program, \nand for other purposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n          THE WORK INCENTIVE AND SELF-SUFFICIENCY ACT OF 1996\n\n Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I introduce the Work Incentive \nand Self-Sufficiency Act of 1996. I believe that few people are \nreturning to work after becoming eligible for Social Security \ndisability income [SSDI] not because they can no longer find gainful \nemployment, but because of a greater systemic problem we face as a \nnation. What I am referring to is this country's current schizophrenic \nnational disability policy.\n  The laudable policy we set forth in the Americans With Disabilities \nAct of 1990 [ADA] which requires that resources be provided to promote \nfunctioning and work for people with disabilities, as well as, income \nsupport for those who cannot work or whose ability to work is very \nlimited, are not well integrated into our current SSDI and SSI \nprograms. This is a very complex problem that we must deal with if we \never expect to get our Federal deficit under control.\n  I remember when we reported the ADA out of the Labor and Human \nResources Committee, the committee made explicit that the goals of this \nlaw were to provide people with disabilities with: equality of \nopportunity, full participation, independent living, and economic self-\nsufficiency. Disability is not just a characteristic of individuals, \nbut is a description of how well someone is able to fit into our \nsociety which includes his or her capacity to work. To provide for a \nclear and consistent national disability policy we must make sure that \nthe incentives, and goals of our public programs, SSDI, SSI, Medicare, \nand Medicaid work in conjunction with the private sector.\n  Many disabled individuals would like to return to work, but they are \nheavily penalized for there efforts to do so. For example, some courts \nhave determined that if a person qualifies for SSDI, but then wants to \ntry to go back to work and can't find a job, they have no cause of \naction under the ADA. I believe that the greatest disincentive for \ndisabled individuals to return to work is the fear of losing their \nhealth care coverage. These individuals literally may not survive \nwithout health care coverage. Their condition often requires immediate \nutilization of health services and they cannot go, for, even for a \nshort period of time, without the security of knowing they have \nguaranteed health coverage. It is understandable that they would prefer \nnot to work if it will jeopardize this lifeline.\n  Also in the labor market, despite the ADA, there is a disincentive to \nhire or maintain the disabled employee. The disabled employee will \nlikely have a chronic high cost illness and if the employer offered a \nhealth plan they would be covered under this plan. It is important to \nkeep in mind that all employer group health plans, both insured and \nself-insured, are covered under ERISA.\n\n[[Page S8473]]\n\nUnder ERISA, the employer currently has substantial flexibility in not \nonly the benefits it chooses to cover, but also the types of plan \ndesign features it uses. Some employers have used plan design features \nwhich will carve out any high cost individual from coverage under the \nemployee benefit health plan.\n  With no where else to turn, disabled individuals once again become \ndependent upon public sector health care plans. This cost-shift from \nthe employer health plans to the public health plans was the main \nargument I made during debate on the Health Insurance Reform Act when I \nbrought my amendment on the lifetime caps to the floor. Employers, by \nlimiting the maximum benefits they will pay for employees in a \nlifetime, actually set the point where their costs will end and \nGovernment expenditures begin. In the private market, health plans \nusually decide how much risk they will assume and then they reinsure \nthe rest. In this case, the private market uses the Government-run \nhealth plans as the reinsurer of last resort.\n  According to previous testimony by the General Accounting Office \n[GAO] no more than 1 of every 1,000 SSI and DI leave the rolls for work \nas a result of the Social Security Administration's assistance. These \nprograms need to place a greater focus on the rule the employer can \nplay in getting people rehabilitated and back to work. Once an \nindividual becomes disabled the link with their current employer is \ndisrupted and often terminated. If there were incentives, particularly \nearly in the process, for the employer to remain involved the chances \nof returning to work would go up markedly.\n  The employer could focus on accommodating a valuable employee rather \nthan on replacing him. Employers could assist their workers in getting \nassessed for rehabilitation services immediately instead of waiting for \nthe SSI or SSDI programs to first complete the application process and \nthen making a referral for such services. If the employer were to keep \nin closer contact it would have better opportunity to prepare for any \nunique assistance the individual might ultimately need like a personal \nassistant or other assistance technology.\n  The Work Incentive and Self-Sufficiency Act of 1996, is designed to \naddress two significant problems in the Social Security Disability \nIncome [SSDI] Program: If individuals with significant disabilities \ncannot keep their health coverage when they return to work, and if that \nwork does not leave them financially better off, they cannot afford to \ngo back and work, and leave the cash assistance they receive under SSDI \nor SSI. It is not only the cash assistance they receive from benefits \nthat is critical, it is the health coverage they obtain through \nbecoming Medicare eligible.\n  Let us look at the numbers. The average monthly SSDI check is $630; \nsome who were in the work force longer at higher earnings receive more \nwhile many others receive less. At the current minimum wage of $4.25 \nper hour, a person working full time--176 hours per month, or 8 hours \nper day for a standard 22 days--will earn $748. This is not much money, \nbut if you assume a slightly better than minimum wage or some overtime \nat 1.5 times regular wages, then take home pay from work replaces the \ncash assistance that is lost.\n  However, that cash assistance brings with it several noncash \nsupports. The most well-known of these is health coverage, which comes \nthrough Medicare for SSDI beneficiaries and through Medicaid for SSI \nrecipients. Other noncash supports include long-term supports under \nMedicaid, vocational rehab, or other programs, food stamps, rental \nassistance, home heating assistance, and a variety of discounts and \nreduced fares on public services, among other supports. The cost of \nreplacing these noncash benefits for individuals with significant \ndisabilities is often double or even triple the value of the cash \nassistance that is lost.\n  The major assumptions are that individuals with significant \ndisabilities can qualify for health coverage, much less afford to pay \nfor it themselves, and private providers for long term supports can be \nlocated and afforded. The reality is that individuals with disabilities \nare often not able to locate health coverage that meets their needs, or \nif they can find coverage, it comes with either high deductibles and \npremiums, services exclusions, preexisting conditions limits, and/or \nyearly or lifetime caps on benefits.\n  The same is true for the long term supports required by some \nindividuals with significant disabilities such as quadriplegia or \ncerebral palsy. Many individuals with disabilities can work if they \nhave the assistance of another person to perform activities of daily \nliving that are required to prepare for work such as bathing, dressing, \neating, transferring from bed to chair or using the bathroom. The \ndifficulty is not with necessarily with working, but with locating and \npaying the support workers needed to prepare for and to perform work.\n  Currently, when an SSDI beneficiary earns $500 monthly, that person \ndemonstrates the capacity to work at the substantial gainful activity \n[SGA] level. If this work is sustained for 9 consecutive months, the \nindividual no longer meets the first criteria for work disability \neligibility: the incapacity to perform substantial gainful work in the \nnational economy. Thus, proceedings are begun to end cash assistance. \nBut, since take home pay equals or exceeds cash assistance, there is no \nproblem.\n  Or is there? One month individuals with significant disabilities are \nearning $748 from wages, less taxes, $630 from cash assistance, and \nreceiving noncash benefits ranging in value from $1,200 to $1,800. The \nnext month these individuals with significant disabilities are earning \n$748 from wages, less taxes, and from this amount now are expected to \npurchase up to $1,800 in medical coverage, long term supports, food, \nrent, and other necessities. It does not require sophisticated cost/\nbenefit calculations here to draw the conclusion that individuals with \nsignificant disabilities are being punished if they attempt to work.\n  There are some basic solutions to this problem. First, continue \nhealth coverage for those who are on SSDI after they return to work. \nSecond, make work pay by allowing low income former SSDI beneficiaries \nto receive benefits that gradually reduce as their take home pay \nincreases. The Work Incentive and Self-Sufficiency Act of 1996 is \ndesigned to implement both of these solutions. First, it allows SSDI \nbeneficiaries to keep their Medicare coverage if they return to work. \nIf they take a job that does not offer health coverage, Medicare \nremains their primary insurance. If they find a position that does \noffer health insurance, they have the option to purchase Medicare \ncoverage to use as supplementary coverage. Working beneficiaries would \npurchase this coverage on their own through premiums that rise on a \nsliding scale.\n  Second, it allows SSDI beneficiaries to keep part of their cash \nassistance after they return to work. Rather than losing the entire \namount once they earn $500 a month, they would lose $1 of cash benefits \nfor every $2 in wages they earn that is above $500 a month. This is \nsimilar to, but not the same as, the rule that allows individuals over \n65 who are retired on Social Security to earn wages and continue to \nreceive retirement income and Medicare.\n  Third, it allows some individuals to apply only for Medicare coverage \nbut not cash assistance. This would offer some workers who acquire a \ndisability during their working years the option to purchase Medicare \ncoverage and continue working. The Medicare coverage could be either \ntheir primary or supplemental coverage.\n  At this point some will ask, ``Won't that increase already rising \ncosts of benefits?'' Actually, no. Extending health coverage to those \nwho return to work will not increase costs essentially because so few \npeople are leaving the disability program for work. In fact, enabling \npeople who were former beneficiaries or recipients to keep this health \ncoverage would lead to some of them eventually being covered by private \nhealth insurance, thus reducing costs. It will also lead to a reduction \nin the amount of SSDI and SSI cash assistance paid as reentering \nworkers replace benefits with wages, and pay taxes on those wages.\n  Employers would not be required to purchase any additional insurance \nor to report any additional information to the Government. Individuals \nwith disabilities would assume the responsibility to exercise the \noption to purchase\n\n[[Page S8474]]\n\nMedicare and pay the Medicare premiums. Considering the very important \nrole employers have in assuring our Nation's policy goal to self-\nsufficiency for individuals with disabilities I am especially pleased \nto have a letter from Michael R. Losey, president and CEO of the \nSociety for Human Resource Management [SHRM]. SHRM is and I quote, \n``fascinated by your proposal that would provide employment incentives \nto individuals with disabilities * * * SHRM looks forward to working \nwith you and your staff to promote employment and reemployment \nincentives for those with disabilities.'' I would also like to thank \nboth Fred Grandy, president and CEO of Goodwill Industries \nInternational, Inc., and the Consortium for Citizens with Disabilities \nTask Force on Social Security, especially the cochairs, Tony Young, \nMarty Ford and Rhonda Schulzinger, for their letters of support for \nthis bill. Mr. President, I asked unanimous consent that these three \nletters be inserted into the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                 Society for Human\n\n\n                                          Resource Management,\n\n                                    Alexandria, VA, July 18, 1996.\n     Senator James M. Jeffords,\n     Hart Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Jeffords: On behalf of the Society for Human \n     Resource Management (SHRM), I am writing to commend you for \n     your efforts to address the employment and reemployment needs \n     of individuals with disabilities. SHRM is the leading voice \n     of the human resource profession, representing the interests \n     of more than 70,000 professional and student members from \n     around the world.\n       SHRM is committed to equal employment opportunity in all \n     employment practices, including hiring, training, \n     compensation, benefits, promotion transfer, termination, and \n     reduction in force, for all individuals without regard to \n     disability. SHRM is committed to these policies because of \n     our firm conviction that adherence to these principles is \n     sound management practice and contributes significantly to \n     the success of our membership and our members' organizations.\n       As a result, SHRM is fascinated by your proposal that would \n     provide employment incentives to individuals with \n     disabilities. Faced with the loss of much-needed health care \n     coverage or minimal financial support, many individuals who \n     could continue making contributions as employees, are \n     actually discouraged from going back to work. It is clear \n     that the private and public sectors should work together to \n     increase opportunities for all Americans.\n       SHRM looks forward to working with you and your staff to \n     promote employment and reemployment incentives for those with \n     disabilities.\n           Sincerely,\n                                           Michael R.

James Jeffords,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Jeffords: The undersigned members of the Task \n     Force on Social Security of the Consortium for Citizens with \n     Disabilities support the principles set forth in the Work \n     Incentive and Self-Support Act of 1996 to enable individuals \n     on Social Security Disability Insurance to return to work.\n       The Consortium for Citizens With Disabilities (CCD) is a \n     working coalition of more than 100 national consumer, service \n     provider, parent and professional organizations that advocate \n     on behalf of people with disabilities and their families. The \n     work of the Consortium in conducted by Task Forces in various \n     policy areas such as health care, education, employment, \n     technology, housing, civil rights, social security, and \n     budget and appropriations.\n       The Work Incentive and Self-Sufficiency Act of 1996 is \n     designed to address two significant problems in the SSDI \n     program: If individuals with significant disabilities 1) \n     cannot keep their health coverage when they return to work \n     and 2) if that work does not leave them financially better \n     off, they can not risk or afford to go back to work, and \n     leave the cash assistance they receive under SSDI.\n       There are some basic solutions to this problem. First, \n     continue health coverage for those who are on SSDI after they \n     return to work. Second, make work pay by allowing low income \n     former SSDI beneficiaries to receive benefits that gradually \n     reduce as their take home pay increases. The Work Incentive \n     and Self-Sufficiency Act of 1996 is designed to implement \n     both of these solutions.\n       First, it allows SSDI beneficiaries to keep their Medicare \n     coverage if they return to work. If they take a job that does \n     not offer health coverage, Medicare remains their primary \n     insurance. If they find a position that does offer health \n     insurance, they have the option to purchase Medicare coverage \n     to use a supplementary coverage. Working beneficiaries would \n     purchase this coverage on their own through premiums that \n     rise on a sliding scale.\n       Second, it allows SSDI beneficiaries to keep part of their \n     cash assistance after they return to work. Rather than losing \n     the entire amount once they earn $500 a month, they would \n     lose $1 of cash benefits for every $2 in wages they earn that \n     is above $500 a month. This is similar to (but not the same \n     as) the rule that allows individuals over 65 who are retired \n     on Social Security to earn wages and continue to receive \n     retirement income and Medicare.\n       Third, it allows some individuals to apply only for \n     Medicare coverage but not cash assistance. This offers some \n     workers who acquire a disability during their working years \n     the option to purchase Medicare coverage and continue \n     working. The Medicare coverage could be either primary \n     or supplemental coverage.\n       We thank you and your lead staff person on this issue, \n     Elaina Goldstein, for the outstanding leadership demonstrated \n     toward enhancing the employment of individuals with \n     disabilities through this bill. This is extremely important \n     legislation for individuals with disabilies.

James M. Jeffords,\n     U.S. Senate, Hart Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Jim: On behalf of the Goodwill Industries network, I \n     congratulate you on the introduction of the Work Incentive \n     and Self-Support Act of 1996.\n       This important legislation incorporates two reforms long \n     advocated by Goodwill Industries to assist Social Security \n     Disability Insurance (SSDI) beneficiaries to return to work. \n     First, we believe that no individual should suffer a loss of \n     income when leaving the SSDI rolls. By allowing a SSDI \n     beneficiary to retain a portion of cash benefits when they \n     re-enter the work force, your legislation will remove this \n     major disincentive. Secondly, Goodwill Industries recognizes \n     that loss of medical insurance is a significant impediment \n     confronting SSDI recipients who want to work. Again, the Work \n     Incentive and Self-Support Act of 1996 addresses this \n     disincentive by permitting an individual to apply for \n     Medicare coverage while working, or to purchase medical \n     coverage with premiums based on income level.\n       Enclosed is a copy of testimony presented last year to the \n     House Ways and Means Subcommittee on Social Security that \n     discusses Goodwill Industries' recommendations for reforming \n     the SSDI program in greater detail.\n       Please let me know how Goodwill Industries can assist you \n     in securing enactment of the Work Incentive and Self-Support \n     Act of 1996.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                      Fred Grandy,\n                              President & Chief Executive Officer.\n       Enclosure--Social Security Testimony.\n\n  Work Incentive and Self-Sufficiency Act of 1996--Section-by-Section \n                                Analysis\n\n       Intent of Legislation: To Create a Consistent Disability \n     Work Incentive Policy for Social Security Disability \n     Insurance Beneficiaries and Conform with the National \n     Disability Policy Established with the Passage of the \n     Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA).\n\n\n                                Overview\n\n       The intent of this bill is to create a work incentive \n     policy for Social Security Disability Income (SSDI) \n     beneficiaries. The model that has been used is the 1619(a)(b) \n     SSI/Medicaid provisions. SSDI and Medicare are amended to \n     provide the same incentive as the 1619 model which is to make \n     sure a person who goes off the DI roles will not be worse \n     off. The key reason, according to the GAO in their report to \n     Senate Select Committee on Aging issued this past April, why \n     many people who can work but do not is because they can not \n     obtain health care coverage because of their disability. \n     Therefore, a buy-in to the Medicare program is paramount in \n     this bill. Although a Medicare buy-\n\n[[Page S8475]]\n\n     in program currently exists it has not been a success.\n       This bill repeals the current trial work period and \n     extended period of eligibility and replaces them with the \n     1619(a)(b) model provisions. Second, we allow people to \n     purchase Medicare if they meet the current medical listing \n     test in SSDI. The buy-in is on a sliding scale.\n       Lastly, the bill also includes the Medicare-Medicaid \n     Integration demonstration project was that was included in \n     the 1995 reconciliation bill and repeals the Medicare/\n     Medicaid Data Bank.\n\n\nSection 2: Return-to-Work Program for Social Security Disability Income \n                             Beneficiaries\n\n                 (A) Benefit reductions based on income\n\n       Current law: An allowed SSDI/Medicare beneficiary who \n     returns to work loses eligibility for DI cash assistance when \n     achieving Substantial Gainful Activity (SGA). SGA is defined \n     as earnings from wages or salaries that equal or surpass $500 \n     monthly (for non bind disabled beneficiaries) that are earned \n     continuously for nine months or longer. Beneficiaries can \n     shelter some income from the SGA calculation by using work \n     incentives such as the Impairment Related Work Expense \n     offset.\n       Revision: An allowed SSDI/Medicare beneficiary who returns \n     to work has their DI cash assistance reduced by $1 for every \n     $2 earned beginning when achieving Substantial Gainful \n     Activity (SGA). SGA is defined as earnings from wages or \n     salaries that equal or surpass $500 monthly (for non blind \n     disabled beneficiaries) that are earned continuously for nine \n     months or longer. Beneficiaries can shelter some income from \n     the SGA calculation by using work incentives such as the \n     Impairment Related Work Expense offset. This creates an \n     incentive similar to the cash continuation provisions for \n     1619(a).\n\n        (B) Benefit reductions for those who are dually eligible\n\n       Current law: An individual who is dually eligible for SSDI \n     and SSI and who returns to work loses eligibility for both DI \n     cash assistance and Medicare when achieving Substantial \n     Gainful Activity (SSA). SGA is defined as earnings from wages \n     or salaries that equal or surpass $500 monthly (for non blind \n     disabled beneficiaries) continuously for nine months or \n     longer. Beneficiaries can shelter some income from the SGA \n     calculation by using work incentives such as the Impairment \n     Related Work Expense offset. This individual would have their \n     SSI cash assistance and Medicaid coverage continued under the \n     1619(a) and (b) program.\n       Revision: An individual who is dually eligible for SSDI and \n     SSI and who returns to work would have their SSI cash \n     assistance and Medicaid coverage continued under the 1619(a) \n     and (b) program, and, when achieving SGA the individual has \n     their DI cash assistance reduced by $1 for every $2 earned. \n     Reductions in cash assistance are taken first from SSI and \n     secondly from SSDI.\n\n                (C) Required continued disability status\n\n       Current law: An individual who is an allowed SSDI/Medicare \n     beneficiary receives a Continuing Disability Review (CDR) at \n     intervals of either three, five, or seven years depending on \n     whether their allowed class is Medical Improvement Expected \n     (MIE = 3 years), Medical Improvement Possible (MIP = 5 years) \n     or Medical Improvement Not Expected (MINE = 7 years). The \n     individual must continue to meet criteria of: 1) earning less \n     than $500 per month in wages or salaries; 2) having a \n     medically determinable physical or mental condition that has \n     lasted or is expected to last 12 or more months; 3) being \n     unable to perform any job in the national economy.\n       Revision: An individual who is an allowed SSDI/Medicare \n     beneficiary receives a Continuing Disability Review (CDR) at \n     intervals of either three, five, or seven years depending on \n     whether their allowed class is Medical Improvement Expected \n     (MIE = 3 years), Medical Improvement Possible (MIP = 5 years) \n     or Medical Improvement Not Expected (MINE = 7 years).

If the individual returns to work and \n     earns $500 or more per month (Substantial Gainful Activity), \n     no cost Medicare continues through a nine month Trial \n     Work Period and a Three month transition period. Beginning \n     in month 13, Medicare continues if the beneficiary elects \n     to pay the full cost of both the Part A and Part B \n     premiums.\n       Revision: An individual who is an allowed SSDI/Medicare \n     beneficiary who returns to work and earns $500 or more per \n     month (SGA), is in a continuing disability status unless \n     medical recovery is determined as described in paragraph 3 \n     above and receives no cost Medicare until Adjusted Gross \n     Income (AGI) reached $15,000; after this point beneficiaries \n     would pay Medicare premiums of 10% of AGI beyond $15,000. \n     This incentive is similar to the continuation of Medicaid \n     under 1619(b). [The exact Formula is to be determined pending \n     additional research].\n\n              (B) Defining the Medicare buy-in conditions\n\n       Current law: An individual who is an allowed SSDI/Medicare \n     beneficiary receives SSDI cash assistance after a five month \n     waiting period and receives Medicare coverage after a two \n     year waiting period. If the individual returns to work and \n     earns $500 or more per month (Substantial Gainful Activity), \n     no cost Medicare continues through a nine month Trial Work \n     Period and a Three month transition period. Beginning in \n     month 13, Medicare continues if the beneficiary elects to pay \n     the full cost of both the Part A and Part B premiums.\n       Revision: An individual who is an allowed Medicare Buy-In \n     beneficiary receives no SSDI cash assistance month, but \n     receives Medicare coverage without a two year waiting period. \n     If the individual returns to work (or remains at work) and \n     earns $500 or more per month (Substantial Gainful Activity), \n     no cost Medicare continues through a nine month Trial Work \n     Period and a Three month transition period. Beginning in \n     month 13, Medicare continues if the beneficiary elects to pay \n     the cost of both the Part A and Part B premiums on a sliding \n     income scale. The beneficiary would receive free Medicare \n     until Adjusted Gross Income (AGI) reached $15,000; after this \n     point beneficiaries would pay a premium of 10% of AGI beyond \n     $15,000.

This criteria \n     includes: 1) earning less than $500 per month in wages or \n     salaries; 2) having a medically determinable physical or \n     mental condition that has lasted or is expected to last 12 or \n     more months; 3) being unable to perform any job in the \n     national economy. In order to meet the criteria of having a \n     medically determinable condition, an applicant must either a) \n     have a condition which meets or exceeds the requirements of \n     the Listings, b) have two or more\n\n[[Page S8476]]\n\n     conditions which meets or exceeds the requirements of the \n     Listings, or c) meet strict functional criteria for not being \n     capable of performing any job in the national economy, given \n     their condition, age, and education. If these criteria are \n     met, an applicant is an allowed beneficiary and receives SSDI \n     cash assistance after a five month waiting period. Medicare \n     begins after a two year waiting period.\n       Revision: An individual qualifies for Medicare Buy-In, but \n     not for SSDI cash assistance, if they meet a slightly less \n     stringent test of disability. The applicant would be required \n     to meet criteria that demonstrates having a medically \n     determinable physical or mental condition that has lasted or \n     is expected to last 12 or more months. In order to meet the \n     criteria of having a medically determinable condition, an \n     applicant must either a) have a condition which meets or \n     exceeds the requirements of the Listings, or b) have two or \n     more conditions which meets or exceeds the requirements of \n     the Listings.

A bill to prohibit the public carrying of a handgun, with \nappropriate exceptions for law enforcement officials and others; to the \nCommittee on the Judiciary.\n\n\n             THE CONCEALED WEAPONS PROHIBITION ACT OF 1996\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation \nthat would prohibit individuals from carrying a handgun, concealed or \nin the open, in public. The bill includes exceptions for certain people \nauthorized to carry handguns under State law, such as law enforcement \npersonnel and duly authorized security officers. Additionally, States \ncould choose to exempt persons whose employment involves the transport \nof substantial amounts of cash or other valuables.\n  Also, Mr. President, States could provide exemptions in individual \ncases, based on credible evidence, that a person should be allowed to \ncarry a handgun because of compelling circumstances warranting an \nexemption, such as a woman being stalked by someone who is threatening \nher. However, a simple claim of concern about generalized risks would \nnot be sufficient. It would have to be a specified, credible threat.\n  Mr. President, common sense tells you that there are more than enough \ndangerous weapons on America's streets. Yet, incredibly, some seem to \nthink that there should be more. They want to turn our States and \ncities into the wild, wild west, where everyone carries a gun on his or \nher own hip, taking the law into their own hands. This is a foolhardy, \nand dangerous, trend.\n  The statistics are clear, Mr. President. This country is already \ndrowning in a sea of gun violence. Every 2 minutes, someone somewhere \nin the United States is shot. Every 14 minutes someone in this country \ndies from a gunshot wound. In 1994 alone, over 15 thousand people in \nour country were killed by handguns. Compare that to countries like \nCanada, where 90 people were killed by handguns that year, or Great \nBritain, which had 68 handgun fatalities.\n  Mr. President, the Federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention \nestimates that by the year 2003, gunfire will have surpassed auto \naccidents as the leading cause of injury-related deaths in the United \nStates. In fact, this is already the case in seven States.\n  It is because we already suffer from an epidemic of gun violence that \nI have introduced this legislation. The fact is, Mr. President, \nconcealed weapons make people less, not more, secure, You don't have to \ntake it from me. Listen to the real experts: The police officers on the \nstreet. There is near-unanimous agreement in the law enforcement \ncommunity that concealed weapons laws are bad policy.\n  Arming more people is not the way to make the streets safer. It is a \nway to get more people killed. Mr. President, the National Rifle \nAssociation and its allies may believe that the presence of concealed \nweapons will scare criminals from committing crimes. To me, just the \nopposite is true. More likely, criminals will just get more violent.\n  Think about it, Mr. President. If a criminal thinks that you might be \ncarrying a concealed weapon, common sense tells you that he is much \nmore likely to simply shoot first, and ask questions later.\n  Perhaps more importantly, concealed weapons will mean that many \nroutine conflicts will escalate into deadly violence. Every day, people \nget into everything from traffic accidents to domestic disputes. Maybe \nthese arguments lead to yelling, or even fisticuffs. But if more people \nare carrying guns, those conflicts are much more likely to end in a \nshooting, and death.\n  Mr. President, the bottom line is that more guns equals more death. \nThis legislation will help in our struggle to reduce the number of guns \non our streets, and help prevent our society from becoming even more \nviolent and dangerous.\n  I hope my colleagues will support the bill, and ask unanimous consent \nthat a copy of the legislation be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows;\n\n                                S. 1980\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION. 1.

A bill to establish a Joint United States-Canada Commission \non Cattle and Beef to identify, and recommend means of resolving, \nnational, regional, and provincial trade-distorting differences between \nthe countries with respect to the production, processing, and sale of \ncattle and beef, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n     THE JOINT UNITED STATES-CANADA COMMISSION ON CATTLE AND BEEF \n                       ESTABLISHMENT ACT OF 1996\n\n Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I introduce a bill of critical \nimportance to our Nation's cattle producers. The Joint United States-\nCanada Commission on Cattle and Beef is designed to resolve some of the \nexisting differences in trade practices between the two countries.\n  As a former rancher, I have a firsthand understanding of the \nchallenges that face the cattle industry. The prolonged down cycle is \nespecially troubling because it affects the livelihoods of thousands of \nranching families in Idaho and across the country.\n  These beef producers are the largest sector of Idaho and American \nagriculture. Over 1 million families raise over 100 million head of \nbeef cattle every year. This contributes over $36 billion to local \neconomies. Even with the extended cycle of low prices, direct cash \nreceipts from the Idaho cattle industry were almost $620 million in \n1995. These totals only represent direct sales; they do not capture the \nmultiplier effect that cattle ranches have in their local economies \nfrom expenditures on labor, feed, fuel, property taxes, and other \ninputs.\n  Over the years, cattle operations have provided a decent living and \ngood way of life in exchange for long days, hard work, and dedication. \nWhile the investment continues to be high, the returns have been low in \nrecent years.\n  The problems facing the cattle industry in recent years are complex. \nThe nature of the market dictates that stable consumption combined with \nincreased productivity and growing herd size yield lower prices to \nproducers. This, combined with high feed prices and limited export \nopportunities, has caused a near crisis.\n  Many Idahoans have contacted me on this issue. Some suggest the \nFederal Government intervene in the market to help producers. However, \nmany others have expressed fear that Federal intervention, if \nexperience is any indication, will only complicate matters and may also \ncreate a number of unintended results. I tend to agree with the latter. \nTime and again, I have seen lawmakers and bureaucrats in Washington, \nDC, albeit well-intentioned, take a difficult situation and make it \nworse. This does not mean that I believe Government has no role to \nplay. I have supported and will continue to support measures of proven \nvalue. However, I will continue to follow this situation closely with \nthe hope that free market forces will, in the long run, aid in making \ncattle producers more efficient, productive, and profitable.\n  The cattle industry is part of a complex, long-term cycle; however, \nthere are producers who might not survive the short-term consequences. \nThe Beef Industry Assistance Resolution addresses a number of these \nshort term issues. These are issues that were raised at a hearing of \nthe Agriculture Committee that I chaired a few weeks ago.\n\n  The resolution has five sections--antitrust monitoring, market \nreporting, private sector self-regulation, recognition of barriers to \ninternational trade, and emergency loan guarantees.\n  Section 1 encourages the Secretary of Agriculture and Department of \nJustice to increase the monitoring of mergers and acquisitions in the \nbeef industry. Investigation of possible barriers in the beef packing \nsector for new firms and with other commodities is encouraged.\n  Section 2 directs the Secretary of Agriculture to expedite the \nreporting of existing beef categories and add additional categories. \nThese categories include contract, formula and live cash cattle prices, \nand boxed beef prices. The Secretary is also encouraged to increase the \nfrequency of captive supply cattle from every 14 to 7 days. I am \nespecially interested in the improved reporting of all beef and live \ncattle exports and imports. The second section also directs the \nSecretary to capture data on a previously unrecorded segment of the \nmarket--away from home consumption. While this market consumes \napproximately half of the Nation's beef production, very little is \nknown about it.\n  Section 3 encourages two very important measures within the private \nsector. First, meat packing companies are encouraged to fully utilize a \ngrid pricing structure which will provide producers with a more \ncomplete picture for the particular type of the cattle they produce. \nSecond, agricultural lenders are encouraged to consider the total asset \nportfolio, not just cash flow, when evaluating this year's beef loans. \nEven the best operators will have great difficulty cash-flowing a \ncattle outfit because of the prolonged period of low prices.\n  Section 4 recognizes a number of barriers to international trade that \nadversely affect American beef producers. The section is meant to \nelevate the importance of all trade issues and specifically references \nthe elimination of the European Union hormone ban and animal health \nbarriers between the United States and Canada.\n  Section 5 recommends that emergency loan guarantees be made available \nto agricultural lenders with cattle industry loans. I am disappointed \nthat the President zeroed out funding for this program in his fiscal \nyear 1997 proposal. I have heard from a number of lenders that a high \nnumber of loans are questionable for this fall.\n  The Beef Industry Assistance Resolution is a measure designed to \nprovide immediate, short-term solutions to some of the serious problems \nfacing the cattle industry. I know that a number of my colleagues have \nlegislation pending in regards to the cattle market. I would comment \nthat I see this resolution as a starting point, not an ending point for \ncattle industry issues.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of my bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1981\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, I submit an amendment regarding reforms to \nthe H-2A Temporary Agricultural Workers Program.\n  Let me start by publicly thanking my good friend, Al Simpson. The \nsenior Senator from Wyoming has been tireless in his efforts to \nmaneuver immigration legislation through the 104th Congress. While, I \nam very appreciative of his efforts in general, I want to address an \nissue that is of utmost importance to this country's farmers and \nranchers.\n  That issue is the impact of immigration reform on the supply of \nagricultural labor. There is very real concern among Idaho farmers and \nthroughout the countryside that these reforms will reduce the \navailability of agricultural workers.\n  Farmers need access to an adequate supply of workers and want to have \ncertainty that they are hiring a legal work force. In 1995, the total \nagricultural work force was about 2.5 million people. That equates to \n6.7% of our labor force that is directly involved in production \nagriculture and food processing.\n  Hired labor is one of the most important and costly inputs in \nfarming. U.S. farmers spent more than $15 billion on hired labor \nexpenses in 1992--one of every eight dollars of farm production \nexpenses. For the labor-intensive fruit, vegetable and horticultural \nsector, labor accounts for 35 to 45 percent of production costs.\n  The competitiveness of U.S. agriculture, especially the fruit, \nvegetable and horticultural specialty sectors, depends on the continued \navailability of hired labor at a reasonable cost. U.S. farmers, \nincluding producers of labor-intensive perishable commodities, compete \ndirectly with producers in other\n\n[[Page S8486]]\n\ncountries for market share in both U.S. and foreign commodity markets.\n  Wages of U.S. farmworkers will not be forced up by eliminating alien \nlabor, because growers' production costs are capped by world market \ncommodity prices. Instead, a reduction in the work force available to \nagriculture will force U.S. producers to reduce production to the level \nthat can be sustained by a smaller work force.\n  Over time, wages for these farm workers have actually risen faster \nthan non-farm worker wages. Between 1986-1994, there was a 34.6-percent \nincrease in average hourly earnings for farm workers, while nonfarm \nworkers only saw a 27.1 percent increase.\n  Even with this increase in on-farm wages, this country has \nhistorically been unable to provide a sufficient number of domestic \nworkers to complete the difficult manual labor required in the \nproduction of many agricultural commodities. In Idaho, this is \nespecially true for producers of fruit, sugar beets, onions and other \nspecialty crops.\n  The difficulty in obtaining sufficient domestic workers is primarily \ndue to the fact that domestic workers prefer the security of full-time \nemployment in year round positions. As a result the available domestic \nwork force tends to prefer the long term positions, leaving the \nseasonal jobs unfilled. In addition, many of the seasonal agricultural \njobs are located in areas where it is necessary for workers to migrate \ninto the area and live temporarily to do the work. Experience has shown \nthat foreign workers are more likely to migrate than domestic workers. \nAs a result of domestic short supply, farmers and ranchers have had to \nrely upon the assistance of foreign workers.\n  The only current mechanism available to admit foreign workers for \nagricultural employment is the H-2A program. The H-2A program is \nintended to serve as a safety valve for times when domestic labor is \nunavailable. Unfortunately, the H-2A program isn't working.\n  Despite efforts to streamline the temporary worker program in 1986, \nit now functions so poorly that few in agriculture use it without \nrisking an inadequate work force, burdensome regulations and potential \nlitigation expense. In fact, usage of the program has actually \ndecreased from 25,000 workers in 1986 to only 17,000 in 1995.\n  Our amendment will provide some much needed reforms to the H-2A \nprogram. I urge my colleagues to consider the following parts of our \namendment as a reasonable modification of the H-2A program.\n  First, the amendment will reduce the advance filing deadline from 60 \nto 40 days before workers are needed. In many agricultural operations, \n60 days is too far in advance to be able to predict labor needs with \nthe precision required in H-2A applications. Furthermore, virtually all \nreferrals of U.S. workers who actually report for work are made close \nto the date of need. The advance application period serves little \npurpose except to provide time for litigation.\n  Second, in lieu of the present certification letter, the Department \nof Labor [DOL] would issue the employer a domestic recruitment report \nindicating that the employer's job offer meets the statutory criteria \nand lists the number of U.S. workers referred. The employer would then \nfile a petition with INS for admission of aliens, including a copy of \nDOL's domestic recruitment report and any countervailing evidence \nconcerning the adequacy of the job offer and/or the availability of \nU.S. workers. The Attorney General would make the admission decision. \nThe purpose is to restore the role of the Labor Department to that of \ngiving advice to the Attorney General on labor availability, and return \ndecision making to the Attorney General.\n  Third, the Department of Labor will be required to provide the \nemployer with a domestic recruitment report not later than 20 days \nbefore the date of need. The report either states sufficient domestic \nworkers are not available or gives the names and Social Security \nNumbers of the able, willing and qualified workers who have been \nreferred to the employer. The Department of Labor now denies \ncertification not only on the basis of workers actually referred to the \nemployer, but also on the basis of reports or suppositions that \nunspecified numbers of workers may become available. The proposed \nchange would assure that only workers actually identified as available \nwould be the basis for denying foreign workers.\n  Fourth, the Immigration and Naturalization Service [INS] will provide \nexpedited processing of employers' petitions, and, if approved, notify \nthe visa issuing consulate or port of entry within 15 calendar days. \nThis will ensure timely admission decisions.\n  Fifth, INS will also provide expedited procedures for amending \npetitions to increase the number of workers admitted on 5 days before \nthe date of need. This is to reduce the paperwork and increase the \ntimeliness of obtaining needed workers very close to or after the work \nhas started.\n  Sixth, DOL will continue to recruit domestic workers and make \nreferrals to employers until 5 days before the date of need. This \nmethod is needed to allow the employer at a date certain to complete \nhis hiring, and to operate without having the operation disrupted by \nhaving to displace existing workers with new workers.\n  Seventh, our amendment will enumerate the specific obligations of \nemployers in occupations in which H-2A workers are employed. The \nproposed definition would define jobs that meet the following criteria \nas not adversely affecting U.S. workers:\n\n       1. The employer offers a competitive wage for the position.\n       2. The employer will provide approved housing, or a \n     reasonable housing allowance, to workers whose permanent \n     place of residence is beyond normal commuting distance.\n       3. The employer continues to provide current transportation \n     reimbursement requirements.\n       4. A guarantee of employment is provided for at least \n     three-quarters of the anticipated hours of work during the \n     actual period of employment.\n       5. The employer will provide workers' compensation or \n     equivalent coverage.\n       6. Employer must comply with all applicable federal, state \n     and local labor laws with respect to both U.S. and alien \n     workers.\n\n  This combination of employment requirements will eliminate the \ndiscretion of Department of Labor to specify terms and conditions of \nemployment on a case-by-case basis. In addition, the scope for \nlitigation will be reduced since employers (and the courts) would know \nwith particularity the required terms and conditions of employment.\n  Eighth, our amendment would provide that workers must exhaust \nadministrative remedies before engaging their employers in litigation.\n  Ninth, certainty would be given to employers who comply with the \nterms of an approved job order. If at a later date the Department of \nLabor requires changes, the employer would be required to comply with \nthe law only prospectively. This very important provision removes the \npossibility of retroactive liability if an approved order is changed.\n  Again, I urge my colleagues to support this amendment and avoid \nactions that would jeopardize the labor supply for American \nagriculture.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                        CRAIG AMENDMENT NO. 4971\n\n  (Ordered to lie on the table.)\n  Mr. CRAIG submitted an amendment intended to be proposed by him to \nthe bill, H.R. 3603, supra; as follows:\n\n       At the end of the matter proposed to be inserted by the \n     amendment, insert the following:\n\n     SEC.   .

\n     or\n       (C) in the case of the judicial branch, if the Director of \n     the Administrative Office of the United States Courts \n     determines that the individual involved possesses unique \n     abilities and is the only qualified applicant available for \n     the position.\n       (3) For the purpose of this subsection, the term \n     ``employment'' includes--\n       (A) employment of any length or under any type of \n     appointment, but does not include employment that is without \n     compensation;

The reduction shall be calculated \n     by comparing the Department's full-time equivalent positions \n     for the fiscal year in which the voluntary separation \n     payments are made with the full-time equivalent position \n     limitation for the prior fiscal year.\n       (h) Reports.--No later than March 31 of each fiscal year, \n     the Office of Personnel Management shall submit to the \n     Committee on Governmental Affairs of the Senate and the \n     Committee on Government Reform and Oversight of the House of \n     Representatives a report which, with respect to the preceding \n     fiscal year, shall include for the Department of \n     Agriculture--\n       (1) the number of employees who received voluntary \n     separation incentives;\n       (2) the average amount of such incentives;\n       (3) the average grade or pay level of the employees who \n     received incentives; and\n       (4) the number of waivers made under subsection (e) in the \n     repayment of voluntary separation incentives, and for each \n     such waiver--\n       (A) the reasons for the waiver; and\n       (B) the title and grade or pay level of the position filled \n     by each employee to whom the waiver applied.\n       (i) Effects on Reductions in Force.--Under procedures \n     prescribed by the Office of Personnel Management, an agency \n     of the Department of Agriculture may administer a reduction \n     in force action to provide that if an employee separates from \n     service and receives an incentive payment under this section \n     during a reduction in force action affecting the agency--\n       (1) another employee who would otherwise be separated from \n     service in such reduction in force may be retained; and\n       (2) the voluntary separation by the employee shall be \n     treated as an involuntary separation resulting from such \n     reduction in force.\n       (j) Employees With Critical Knowledge and Skills.--The \n     Secretary may exclude an employee from receiving a separation \n     incentive payment under this section, if the Secretary \n     determines that--\n       (1) such employee has critical knowledge and skills; and\n       (2) separation by the employee would impair the performance \n     of the employing agency's mission.\n       (k) Continuation of Health Insurance Coverage.--(1)(A) \n     During the period beginning on the date of the enactment of \n     this Act through September 30, 2000, any employee described \n     under paragraph (2) may elect continued health care insurance \n     for no longer than 18 months in accordance with section 8905a \n     of title 5, United States Code.\n       (B) Notwithstanding section 8905a(d)(1)(A) of title 5, \n     United States Code--\n       (i) such employee shall pay only the amount of the employee \n     contribution into the Employees Health Benefits Fund; and\n       (ii) the Department of Agriculture shall pay the amount of \n     the agency contribution and any cost of administrative \n     expenses into the Employees Health Benefits Fund.\n       (2) An employee referred to under paragraph (1) is any \n     employee who--\n       (A) voluntarily separates from service and receives an \n     incentive payment under this section; or\n       (B) is involuntarily separated from service in a reduction \n     in force action.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                      PRESSLER AMENDMENT NO. 4981\n\n  Mr. COCHRAN (for Mr. Pressler) proposed an amendment to the bill, \nH.R. 3603, supra; as follows:\n\n       At the end of the bill, add the following:\n\n     SEC.  .

The entertainment was also a highlight. The Singing \nSenators--Trent Lott, Larry Craig, John Ashcroft, and Jim Jeffords--\nbrought the house down as they sang in near perfect harmony such tunes \nas ``Dig a Little Deeper'' and ``Elvira.''\n  The evening of course belonged to Senator Hatfield. The evening's \nquiet humor, graciousness, thoughtful remarks, and kind words were \nperfect for the witty, gracious, thoughtful, and kind Mark Hatfield. I \nask that the article from the Washington Post be printed in the Record.\n  The article follows:\n\n                [From the Washington Post, July 19 1996]\n\n                       Hats Off to Mark Hatfield\n\n\n   Senators Gather to Sing Praises of Retiring Gentleman From Oregon\n\n                          (By Roxanne Roberts)\n\n       Short of giving away millions of dollars, the best way to \n     ensure lavish tributes this year is to resign from the United \n     States Senate.\n       But how many politicians could get both Bill Clinton and \n     Trent Lott to sing their praises? Sen. Mark Hatfield, for \n     one.\n       ``Because he has tried to love his enemies, he has no \n     enemies,'' said the president last night, thanking the \n     retiring Oregon Republican for his unwavering conviction, \n     humanitarian spirit, faith and 30 years of consensus \n     building. ``This town is the poorer for his leaving, but the \n     richer for his legacy.''\n       One could also detect a serious undertone in the Sheraton \n     Washington ballroom that went beyond the loss of this one \n     ``remarkable man,'' as Clinton called him. Hatfield is one of \n     14 senators who have decided not to return, the largest \n     exodus from the august institution in 100 years.\n       ``I approach this evening with an inescapable nostalgia,'' \n     said a subdued Howard Baker. Hatfield is the last of the \n     class who, with Baker, came to the Senate in January 1967. \n     ``With his retirement, not only a distinguished career, but a \n     political era, is ending,'' said the former majority leader.\n       Heads in the audience of more than 700 nodded in agreement. \n     The dinner for Hatfield was the second in what promises to be \n     a continuing lovefest for moderate politicians on both sides \n     of the aisle: A black-tie dinner in May for Sen. Alan Simpson \n     (R-Wyo.) kicked off the tributes, with most of the Senate and \n     former president George Bush in attendance.\n       ``It was very, very touching,'' said Simpson last night. \n     ``I loved it.''\n       Sen. Howell Heflin (D-Ala.), who is also leaving, noted \n     that a retiring senator can do almost no wrong. ``Most people \n     wish you well,'' he said.\n       ``They're not as demanding. Maybe they figure now you can \n     tell them to. . .''--he paused and smiled broadly--``. . . \n     whatever.''\n       Hatfield's dinner and the entertainment were delayed by --\n     what else?--a Senate vote. So the honoree and the president \n     opened the program with a little mutual admiration.\n       Hatfield, characteristically, talked about what he had in \n     common with Clinton: both small-town boys, both governors and \n     ``both of us, in our time in Washington, have managed to \n     irritate both the Republicans and Democrats,'' said the only \n     GOP senator to vote against the balanced-budget amendment \n     last year on principle.\n       ``If all of us could be more like you, America would be an \n     even greater nation,'' Clinton returned.\n       Once the ``entertainment'' had cast its votes, they arrived \n     to take the stage. The ``Singing Senators''--Majority Leader \n     Lott, Larry Craig (R-Idaho), Jim Jeffords (R-Vt.) and John \n     Ashcroft (R-Mo.)--are a cross between a barbershop quartet \n     and IRS auditors.\n       ``It sort of epitomizes the Senate,'' said Lott. ``We don't \n     always make great music, but we keep working on it.''\n       There were high fives after the first medley. (\"Anytime we \n     start together and end together, we celebrate,'' Lott \n     explained). Then they belted out three spirited but dreadful \n     selections, including ``Dig a Little Deeper'' (a nod to \n     Hatfield's chairmanship of the Appropriations Committee), and \n     capped the performance with Lott soloing on ``Elvira.''\n       ``Think of it this way: It's in a good cause,'' observed \n     emcee Cokie Roberts wryly.\n       The cause, the Mark O. Hatfield Library at Willamette \n     University in Hatfield's home state, received the proceeds of \n     the $500-per-seat event. Even lobbyists contributed solely \n     out of admiration for Hatfield.\n       ``Hatfield's leaving, so there's nothing he can do for \n     us,'' said one who declined to identify himself. ``He has \n     been a straight-shooter his entire career. He's a good guy \n     and deserves the recognition.''\n       After dinner, a video chronicled Hatfield's career, \n     including his opposition to the death penalty and his work to \n     ban nuclear testing.\n       When it was his turn to speak, Hatfield didn't crack a \n     smile. ``He's always reserved and serious,'' said Sen. Jay \n     Rockefeller (D-W.Va.). ``And yet, when you're alone with him, \n     he's gentle, thoughtful, kind. He's just a splendid human \n     being.''\n       Calling himself truly blessed, Hatfield thanked his family \n     and staff. The son of a blacksmith and a schoolteacher also \n     thanked long-dead teachers and voters, then moved on to his \n     colleagues.\n       ``For your diversity--Republicans, Democrats, \n     Independents--you have helped keep me in the political \n     center,'' said Hatfield.\n       ``And I'm grateful.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/07/22/senate-section/article/S8489-1", "month": "07", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "22", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8489]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       TRIBUTE TO SAM M. GIBBONS\n\n Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, it was a great privilege for me to \nintroduce legislation to name the Federal Courthouse in Tampa, FL as \nthe Sam M. Gibbons United States Courthouse.\n  The Honorable Sam Gibbons has devoted his entire life to serving the \nUnited States of America. A veteran of World War II, Gibbons was \nawarded the Bronze Star after parachuting into Normandy on D-day as a \npart of the initial Allied assault force. He achieved the rank of \ncaptain in the 501st Parachute Infantry of the 101st Airborne Division \nbefore embarking on his long and distinguished career as a public \nservant.\n  Gibbons' career in public service began with his election to the \nFlorida House of Representatives in 1952. In the Florida House, he \npassed legislation creating the University of South Florida and is \nappropriately recognized as The father of the University of South \nFlorida. In 1958, Gibbons' moved from the House to the Florida Senate \nwhere he enacted legislation to establish Florida's regional water \nmanagement districts. These districts are vital to Florida's ability to \nallocate and preserve its precious water resources.\n  Gibbons barnstormed into the U.S. Congress in 1962. President Johnson \nappointed Gibbons, then a junior Congressman, floor manager of his \nGreat Society initiatives. Gibbons deftly steered this legislation, \nincluding Project Head Start, through the Congress. He also wrote the \nlaw that allows Americans over the age of 55 to protect, from taxation, \ncapital gains from the sale of their primary homes. Despite his \nenormous achievements in social policy, Gibbons' experience as a \nlegislator was not limited solely to domestic issues.\n  As acting chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee in 1994 and \nchairman of the Ways and Means Trade Subcommittee from 1981 through May \n1994, Gibbons has been a champion of open markets and free trade around \nthe world. Under his direction, two of our Nation's most comprehensive \ntrade agreements, the North American Free Trade Agreement [NAFTA] and \nthe General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade [GATT] passed Congress, and \nwere signed into law.\n  Today, Congressman Gibbons sits as the Dean of the Florida \ncongressional delegation. At the end of the 104th Congress, Gibbons \nwill complete his 17th term representing the Tampa Bay area. The \nGibbons family has lived in Tampa for more than a century. Congressman \nand Mrs. Gibbons, who will celebrate their 50th wedding anniversary \nthis year, have also served together tirelessly to improve the lives \nall Tampa residents.\n  A graduate of the University of Florida College of Law and a member \nof Florida Blue Key, Gibbons has served the State of Florida and the \nUnited States of America with distinction. This courthouse should be \nnamed as a tribute to the lifetime works of Congressman Sam M. \nGibbons.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/07/22/senate-section/article/S8489-2", "month": "07", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "22", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8489-S8490]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         HONORING THOMAS ROMANO\n\n Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to honor Thomas \nRussell\n\n[[Page S8490]]\n\nRomano, executive director of the adult day center in Branford, CT. \nThrough his efforts over the past 15 years, the East Shore Regional \nAdult Day Center has become a model organization for the care of the \nelderly, as well as for physically and mentally challenged adults.\n  The adult day center has organized many activities to foster \ncommunity growth. Many activities involve children from area schools as \npart of the center's intergenerational program which has been \norganized. An event such as this one provides an invaluable experience \nfor not only the adults, but the children as well. In addition, the \nadult day center has started the expansion of its therapeutic \nrecreation outdoors program. Various community groups--churches, \nservice organizations, businesses, and others--have received this \nproject very well, showing their enthusiasm with financial support.\n  Mr. Romano and the staff at the center has provided respite from 24 \nhour care for over 600 families in the Greater New Haven area. The \nprograms that they have organized not only foster the growth of these \nindividuals, but it also prevents the premature institutionalization of \nthese individuals as well.\n  The adult day center has been an innovator in meeting the social and \nhealth care needs of this special population by providing services such \nas medical monitoring and recreational therapies, among others. Thomas \nRussell Romano, in his position as president and C.E.O. of this \norganization, has twice been distinguished with Certificate of Award by \nthe Connecticut Department on Aging for his dedication and work with \nthe facility.\n  In the future, I hope that the work of Mr. Romano shall continue to \nflourish and expand in scope to reach a more expansive area. On the \noccasion of the 15th anniversary of the East Shore Regional Adult Day \nCenter, Mr. Romano and the entire staff should be commended on the \ntireless work and dedication which they have shown in furthering the \ndevelopment of not only the individuals who participate in the program, \nbut the development of the community as well.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/07/22/senate-section/article/S8489-3", "month": "07", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "22", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8490]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     DUCKING ON AFFIRMATIVE ACTION\n\n Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, the New York Times recently had an \neditorial titled Ducking on Affirmative Action.\n  The subject is the refusal of the Supreme Court to consider a \ndecision by the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals that would have \ndevastating consequences for our society.\n  No one should underestimate the shortsightedness and the harm that \ncan come from leaving the Hopwood decision of the fifth circuit stand.\n  Mr. President, I ask that this article from the New York Times be \nprinted in the Record.\n  The article follows:\n\n                     Ducking on Affirmative Action\n\n       In a hurtful blow to affirmative action in higher \n     education, the Supreme Court said on Monday that it would not \n     hear an appeal by the state of Texas from a lower court \n     ruling that barred public universities from using race as a \n     factor in selecting students. With this sidestepping, the \n     Court left officials in at least three Southern states who \n     are working to open educational opportunities for minorities \n     in an untenable state of uncertainty. It also sowed confusion \n     nationwide--hardly an uplifting way for the Court to finish \n     its term and head into recess. The Court should instead have \n     seized the opportunity to reject the lower court's flawed \n     pronouncement and reaffirmed its historic commitment to \n     carefully designed affirmative action.\n       The high court seemed insensitive to the long history of \n     racism at the University of Texas Law School, whose \n     affirmative action program was challenged by rejected white \n     applicants, giving rise to the case. As late as 1971, the law \n     school admitted no black students. The Court also ignored the \n     Clinton Justice Department, which filed a brief warning that \n     the ``practical effect'' of the lower court's holding ``will \n     be to return the most prestigious institutions within state \n     university systems to their former `white' status.''\n       The refusal to hear the case left standing a ruling by the \n     United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit that \n     caused justifiable consternation in the academic world three \n     months ago. An appellate panel invalidated a special \n     admissions program at the Texas law school aimed at \n     increasing the number of black and Mexican-American students. \n     In doing so, the panel took the gratuitous, additional step \n     of declaring the Supreme Court's landmark 1978 affirmative \n     action decision in the so-called Bakke case no longer good \n     law. That case, involving a suit by a rejected white \n     applicant who sought entry to a California state medical \n     school, resulted in a ruling that barred the use of quotas in \n     affirmative action plans but permitted universities to use \n     race as a factor in choosing among applicants to serve the \n     ``compelling interest'' of creating a diverse student body.\n       If Bakke is no longer good law, it is for the Supreme Court \n     to declare. But instead of grabbing the case to reassert \n     Bakke's sound principle, the justices found a way out in the \n     odd posture of the case. In an unusual one-paragraph opinion \n     that was also signed by Justice David Souter, Justice Ruth \n     Blader Ginsburg said that the Court was denying review \n     because the case did not actually present a live controversy. \n     The kind of two-track admissions system that inspired the \n     legal challenge is no longer used or defended by Texas, she \n     explained. Like most other colleges and universities, the \n     University of Texas Law School now uses a single applicant \n     pool, in which race is one factor to be considered among \n     others in choosing among the qualified.\n       Justice Ginsburg's message, a welcome one, was that the \n     Court's refusal to hear the case should not be read as an \n     endorsement of the Fifth Circuit's analysis. But, in fact, \n     there was a remaining live controversy before the Court in \n     the Fifth Circuit's direction to a state's leading law school \n     to complete-direction to a state's leading law school to \n     completely excluded race as a factor in future admissions. \n     The shame is the Court declined to address it.\n       Instead, the Court left behind a mess. Its refusal to hear \n     the case has put educational institutions in the three states \n     that make up the Fifth Circuit--Texas, Louisiana and \n     Mississippi--in a terrible spot. They could face punitive \n     damages if they fail to change their practices to conform to \n     an ill-considered ruling that may ultimately be judged an \n     incorrect statement of the law.\n       Nervous educators elsewhere in the nation can find some \n     comfort at least in Justice Ginsburg's benign explanation. \n     Eventually, this equal rights battle will find its way back \n     to the Supreme Court. Meanwhile, it is premature to give up \n     on affirmative action programs still needed to blot out \n     historic racial bias and promote educational \n     diversity.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/07/22/senate-section/article/S8490-1", "month": "07", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "22", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8490]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           EXECUTIVE SESSION\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                           EXECUTIVE CALENDAR\n\n  Mr. COCHRAN.

Mr. President, I do not know if I will take 10 minutes or \nnot, but it was called to my attention this morning when I got back in \ntown that there was an opinion piece that appeared in the Washington \nPost yesterday, Sunday, written by Mr. Henry Aaron, a senior fellow in \nthe Economic Studies Program at the Brookings Institution. The headline \nis ``The Myths of the Social Security Crisis.'' Henry Aaron, a \ndistinguished fellow and economist, goes through one, two, three, four, \nfive myths.\n  I do not know how many of my colleagues or how many people that are \nconcerned about this particular issue read this opinion piece, but I \nwanted to immediately--and I will come later to the floor to deal with \nsome of the statements Mr. Aaron makes in detail--but wanted to \nimmediately come to the floor and urge colleagues who have increasingly \nstarted looking at Social Security as an issue that we need to address \ncurrently, to hear the following.\n  First, Mr. Aaron says myth one is that ``Social Security is in \ncrisis.'' This essentially is a strawman argument, the fact that some \npeople are saying it is in crisis. Destroy that argument, therefore, we \ndo not need to do anything.\n  Mr. President, I hope we do not have to deal with problems only when \nthey are in crisis. I hope that, particularly with a program that \npromises retirement payments to people 30, 40, 50, 60, 70 years from \nnow--and understand that every beneficiary of Social Security for the \nnext 70 years is alive today. They may be 5 years old, but they are \nfuture beneficiaries. And we need to, whether or not we have the \nresources or the will, to be able to pay their benefits. So the longer \none delays, the more difficult the solution becomes.\n  Mr. Aaron actually later on said one myth is that it is ``the third \nrail of American politics--touch it and you die.'' That is another myth \nhe identifies. I do not actually think that is a myth.\n  The last time we dealt with Social Security substantively was in \n1983. We waited until we were almost out of money. Even then we almost \ndid not do anything. Even then it took an independent panel to provide \nthe Congress with protection.\n  Mr. Aaron says we did it in 1983. The change that was made in 1983 is \nalready under attack. The reason it was changed was the Deficit-\nReduction Act. There was a substantial effort to eliminate that change.\n  So I do not think that the fact that Congress has dealt finally with \nSocial Security is a myth that destroys the myth that this is a third \nrail, we wait until it is in crisis. If we wait once again until it is \nin crisis, Mr. President, we are not going to see the same thing we had \nin 1983. Once the baby boomers have retired, and you look at the \nnumbers that are required to pay out, it is a much different situation \nthan we face today. It is not in crisis. I do not argue that Social \nSecurity is in crisis. I am not saying it is contributing to the \ndeficit, which is another myth that is here.\n  But one of the myths that is not on Mr. Aaron's list--and I have a \ngreat respect for Henry Aaron and his views--but one of the myths he \ndoes not identify that is the most troubling and difficult of all is \nthat Americans who are beneficiaries today, No. 1, believe that the \nSocial Security Program is a savings program, that all they are getting \nback is what they paid in.\n  We have perpetrated that myth very often with television advertising \nsaying: Your Social Security is safe. I will not let anybody touch your \nSocial Security. It is the safest program that we have today. You do \nnot really hear people standing up talking about radical change in the \nprogram or cutting current beneficiaries.\n  But to listen to the organizations who are concerned about this \nprogram talk, when they do their direct mail pieces, you would think \nthat every single day somebody is down here on the floor talking about \nchanges in the program.\n  The program enjoys broad support from the American people. And 85 \npercent of almost every generation supports Social Security as a \nprogram. It has reduced the rates of poverty substantially in this \ncountry of people over the age of 65. It has been, in general, a very, \nvery good program.\n  The myth, though, that it is a savings program encourages people to \nbelieve that their payroll tax is going into an account that is \nreserved for them that they own. It is not being reserved for them. \nSocial Security was designed as a collective transfer program. It is \nsocial insurance because there are progressive payments made. The \nconnection between what you receive is based upon your income, not \nbased upon what you have contributed. It is very progressive.\n  As a consequence, it has been a program that most, I think, look at \nas a good way to help, and particularly lower income retirees avoid the \ntrauma of living in poverty at the very time when they are no longer \nable to produce and earn a living.\n  But it is not savings. That is the most difficult myth of all. There \nis no account being held here for people that are paying into the \nprogram, which leads, Mr. President, to one of the most important \nreasons that people, like myself, have been arguing for reform.\n  The first one is, as I said earlier, waiting until the end, as we \ntypically do. Mr. Aaron is basically saying: Wait until there is a \ncrisis. There is no crisis. Why act? Wait until there is a crisis, he \nis saying. Wait another 30 years until there is a crisis, and then act.\n  That is foolishness to do that. The people who are going to pay the \nprice for that are not current beneficiaries, people currently \nreceiving payments. But it will be people under the age of 43 who will \nhave to answer the question, ``Gee, wait a minute. Do I want, in order \nto preserve my benefits, my kids to pay that kind of payroll tax?'' \nLook at the kind of payroll tax that they are going to have to pay if \nyou wait for 30 years, if some kind of adjustment is not made before \nthen.\n\n[[Page S8492]]\n\n  One of the flaws, in my judgment, of the 1983 fix was it said that we \nare going to raise taxes higher than what is necessary for the first \ntime in the 50-year history of the program. The 1983 fix said, we are \ngoing to raise taxes higher than what is necessary to prefund the \nbenefits of the baby-boom generation. Then we immediately--rather than \nsetting it aside to be used for the baby-boom generation--we \nimmediately begin to use it to pay for current expenditures.\n  Again, I am not arguing that Social Security contributes to the \ndeficit. But I am prepared to argue that people who get paid by the \nhour, people whose wages are under $62,400 a year, which if you are \nlooking for a definition of the middle class, you just as well said it \nthere, because everybody over $62,400 does not pay that full 12.4 \npercent. You only pay it on the first $62,400. Anybody who is under \n$62,400, understand, you are shouldering more deficit reduction than \nthose above because you are paying higher taxes on your payroll than \nneeded to fund current benefits.\n  I do make the argument that the program needs to be changed sooner \nrather than later because we want to avoid the crisis, because you want \nto look out in the future and say that, whether you are a beneficiary \nwho is 20 or 30 or 40, regardless of your age, whatever promise we have \non the table we ought to be able to fund it.\n  I believe it was a mistake to change the law in 1983 to have this \naccount building up to this huge amount, first, because we used it for \ndeficit reduction, but, second, I do not think it makes any sense to \nsay that we are only concerned about the beneficiaries over the next \n35, 40 years.\n  Whatever promise we have on the table we ought to be able to keep for \neveryone in perpetuity. Any insurance company has to do that, has to \nabide by that rule, and we should, as well.\n  To do that, Mr. President, what you need to do is change the funds, \nso you build it up to a level that keeps it stable and then keeps it \nthere in perpetuity. Whatever payroll taxes are needed, whatever \nbenefits we are promising to pay to future beneficiaries, you should be \nable to look and have the actuaries run the numbers and say, you have a \nstable fund, it will be there forever; the benefits that you promised \nto somebody 20, 30, 40, years ago, you will be able to keep those \npromises just as you said.\n  The implication given by Mr. Aaron, and I really do regret it, is \nthat the financial managers in America are putting a lot of pressure on \nCongress to change this program so that it is privatized. First, Mr. \nAaron, in this article, says one of the dirty little secrets about \nprivatization is that it requires a tax increase, and nobody is making \na proposal in partial privatization. That comes upfront with that. \nFirst, it does not require a tax increase in all cases; second, there \nis a proposal already. Senator Simpson and I introduced legislation \nthat would allow Americans to take 2 percent of their payroll tax and \nuse it, individualize their own wealth. It is fully funded. There is no \ntax increase in that.\n  I intend to send a copy to Mr. Aaron so he can evaluate it and \ndetermine whether he likes the proposal, or the next time he criticizes \nCongress or a general audience for not having a specific proposal, at \nleast he can offer one exception.\n  Mr. President, I think the privatization argument itself is better \nframed, rather than, Are you for privatization or against it, better \nframed, Are you for the individualization of the account? By that I \nmean, under the proposal of Senator Simpson and myself, what we do is \nsay there is still a collective payment, still a payment, although it \nis misdescribed by many people. We will promise to transfer from the \nwages of people who are working, a fixed payment, fixed tax on their \nwages, and transfer, in a very progressive way, to people who are \nretired. That will still be there. You will be eligible for early \npayment if you want it, or a regular payment, or a late payment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair advises the Senator the 10 minutes \nhave expired.\n  Mr. KERREY. I end with 30 seconds, by merely saying the personal \ninvestment plan, as described by Senator Simpson and myself, is not \nprivatization. It is fully funded. And it is, it seems to me, called \nfor in a program which has not been changed fundamentally in 60 years.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/07/22/senate-section/article/S8491-3", "month": "07", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "22", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8492]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    ADJOURNMENT UNTIL 9:30 TOMORROW\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.
