Under the previous order, the Senate will \nnow proceed to the consideration of Senate Joint Resolution 31, which \nthe clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A joint resolution (S.J. Res. 31) proposing an amendment to \n     the Constitution of the United States to grant Congress and \n     the States the power to prohibit the physical desecration of \n     the flag of the United States.\n\n  The Senate proceeded to consideration of the joint resolution.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. DeWINE). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, in listening to the debate on the flag \namendment on Wednesday and some of the remarks of some of my colleagues \nhere on the floor, my reaction with respect to some of their arguments \nand some of the arguments of the opponents of the flag amendment comes \ndown to, there they go again. The same tired, old, worn out arguments, \nagain and again.\n  One of my colleagues from Arkansas says we are here because of \n``pure, sheer politics.'' Evidently, some opponents of the amendment \nbelieve there is only one side to this argument, and everybody else \nmust be playing politics. Tell that to Rose Lee, a Gold Star Wife and \npast president of the Gold Star Wives of America.\n  She testified in support of this constitutional amendment to prevent \ndesecration of the American flag, our national symbol. She testified in \nsupport of this amendment on June 6, 1995, before the Constitution \nSubcommittee, and brought with her the flag that had draped her \nhusband's coffin. She said:\n\n       It's not fair and it's not right that flags like this flag, \n     handed to me by an honor guard 23 years ago, can be legally \n     burned by someone in this country. It is a dishonor to our \n     husbands and an insult to their widows to allow this flag to \n     be legally burned.\n\n  Go tell Rose Lee she supports the flag protection amendment out of \npure, sheer politics.\n  Go tell the members of the American Legion who have been visiting our \noffices. Go tell our colleague, Senator Heflin, a Silver Star winner \nfrom World War II, that he is playing politics. Tell the Senate \nDemocratic whip, Senator Ford, that he is playing politics by \ncosponsoring and supporting this amendment, a man who has suffered a \nlot for this country. Tell the Democratic leader of the other body, \nCongressman Richard Gephardt, and 92 other House Democrats that they \nplayed politics when they voted for this amendment.\n  As for the number of flag desecrations--again, my friend from \nArkansas was wrong. He said there were none this year. In fact, there \nhave been published reports of at least 20 American flags destroyed at \na cemetery in Bloomington, IN, alone. They were cut or ripped from \nflagpoles and burned. These desecrations were also reported on local \ntelevision. \n\n[[Page S 18254]]\n\n  In July of this year, according to USA Today, a flag was defaced with \nobscene messages about President Clinton and Speaker Gingrich in New \nHampshire. Are there not countless ways of expressing these views \nwithout defacing the flag?\n  In June, a flag was burned in Hays, KS. Just a short time ago, I saw \na news clip about a motorist at a gas station using an American flag to \nwipe the car's dipstick. A veteran--a veteran-- called it to the \npolice's attention but, of course, the individual cannot be prosecuted \ntoday for that desecration of the flag. He can keep using it as he has, \nor perhaps he will next use it to wash his car.\n  My friend from Arkansas raised a concern about a person being \npunished for refusing to salute or honor the flag. No law enacted under \nthe flag amendment can compel anyone to salute or honor the flag, to \nsay nice things about the flag, or otherwise compel anyone to respect \nthe flag. There is an obvious difference between prohibiting physical \ndesecration of the American flag, and compelling someone to express \nrespect for it. So it is totally irrelevant, in this debate, to talk \nabout punishment for failing to respect or salute the flag or pledge \nallegiance to it. The pending amendment simply does not authorize such \npunishment. Nor does it authorize punishment for saying critical things \nabout the flag, or anything else.\n  Some of my friends who have spoken here also drew attention to a \nchart with various flags on it from places like Nazi Germany, the \nSoviet Union, Cuba, and Iraq, with the American flag in the middle. One \nof my colleagues pointed out that these other countries prohibited flag \ndesecration.\n  But when opponents of the amendment trot out these comparisons among \ncountries and their flag desecration laws, they never really explain \nfully their point. To begin with, the difference between the American \nflag and these other flags is certainly self-evident to all of my \ncolleagues and to the American people. And, of course, I know that \nthose of my colleagues who think these comparisons are useful, \nrecognize the difference between what the American flag represents and \nwhat Nazi Germany's flag represents.\n  So what really is the point of the comparisons of flag desecration \nlaws in these countries? Is it that, in some undefined way, there is a \nkind of moral equivalence between Nazi Germany, Iraq, and the United \nStates if all three prohibit physical desecration of their flags? That \nis too nonsensical to be the point. Indeed, until 1989, 48 States and \nCongress had outlawed physical desecration of the flag. Did any \nopponent of the amendment feel they were in a police state during that \ntime? I do not think anybody did. Did the American people not have \nnumerous ways to express themselves without physically desecrating our \nflag? Indeed, as I explained in my opening remarks on Wednesday, \nfreedom of speech actually expanded in this country through 1989, even \nas flag protection statutes were being enacted.\n  If I told my colleagues that Nazi Germany also had stringent gun \ncontrol laws, do the opponents of the flag protection amendment \nbelieve, for that reason, America better not adopt a particular gun \ncontrol measure? They did. To use that kind of reasoning, why would \nthat not follow?\n  If I told the opponents of the flag protection amendment that a \npolice state had liberal abortion laws, would that turn them into pro-\nlifers in America? Would it turn them into supporters of the Partial-\nBirth Abortion Ban Act of 1995?\n  So what is the point of comparing whether Nazi Germany, Iraq, and the \nUnited States protect their respective flags?\n  Certainly, it is not to compare those who voted for a measure \nprotecting the flag, such as the Biden statute, including the Senator \nfrom Arkansas and almost every other Senator, with the dictators of \nNazi Germany and Iraq.\n  I was struck by the highlighting of the Nazi flag on the same chart \nas the American flag. It reminded me of another use of these two flags.\n  Stephan Ross is a psychologist in Boston, MA. He gave a presentation \nin the Hart Senate Office Building earlier this year. He began by \ndisplaying a Nazi flag, and told the audience he had lived under that \nflag for several years.\n  In 1940, at the age of nine, the Nazis seized him from his home in \nKrasnik, Poland. He was a prisoner for 5 years in 10 Nazi death camps. \nThe American army liberated Mr. Ross from Dachau in April 1945. In Mr. \nRoss's words:\n\n       We were nursed for several days by these war-weary, but \n     compassionate men and women until we had enough strength to \n     travel to Munich for additional medical attention.\n       As we walked ever so slowly and unsteadily toward our \n     salvation, a young American tank commander--whose name I have \n     never known--jumped off his tank to help us in whatever way \n     he could. When he saw that I was just a young boy, despite my \n     gaunt appearance, he stopped to offer me comfort and \n     compassion. He gave me his own food. He touched my withered \n     body with his hands and his heart. His love instilled in me a \n     will to live, and I fell at his feet and shed my first tears \n     in five years.\n\n  The young American tank commander gave Mr. Ross what he at first \nbelieved to be a handkerchief. Mr. Ross said:\n\n       It was only later, after he had gone, that I realized that \n     his handkerchief was a small American flag, the first I had \n     ever seen. It became my flag of redemption and freedom. . . .\n       Even now, 50 years later, I am overcome with tears and \n     gratitude whenever I see our glorious American flag, because \n     I know what it represents not only to me, but to millions \n     around the world . . . .\n       Protest if you wish. Speak loudly, even curse our country \n     and our flag, but please, in the name of all those who died \n     for our freedoms, don't physically harm what is so sacred to \n     me and countless others.\n\n  Go tell Stephen Ross that protecting the American flag from physical \ndesecration is in any way like protecting the Nazi flag from such \ndesecration, or in any way represents some notion, however small, of \nmoral equivalence between Nazi Germany and the United States, or in any \nway puts the United States on some kind of par with Nazi Germany. That \nanalogy just will not float.\n  Mr. Ross still has the flag the American tank commander gave him in \n1945. Mr. Ross is a supporter of this amendment, and one can read about \nhis story on the front page of the July 4, 1995, USA Today.\n  Mr. President, some of my other colleagues argue that enactment of \nthis flag amendment would be the beginning of a long slide down a \nslippery slope to further restrictions on free speech. Give me a break. \nThey even make a thinly veiled comparison between prohibiting physical \ndesecration of the American flag with the Chinese Government's \nexecution of three dissidents. Give me a break. This argument is \nincredibly overblown. In answer to this, I would like to quote from a \nletter Bruce Fein, an opponent of the amendment who testified against \nthe amendment. He wrote to the Judiciary Committee in June of this year \nin response to my questions. He states:\n\n       The proposed amendment is a submicroscopic encroachment on \n     free expression that would leave the U.S. galaxies beyond any \n     other nation in history in tolerating free speech and press. \n     If foreign nations were to emulate the constitutional \n     protection of freedom of expression in the United States even \n     with a flag burning amendment, they would earn glittering \n     accolades in the State Department's annual Human Rights \n     reports and from Amnesty International and Human Rights \n     Watch.\n\n  Mr. President, it is time for us to recognize that the American flag \nis our national symbol; that it has meaning to millions and millions of \nAmericans all over this country, many of whom have fought for this \ncountry, many of whom have suffered as family members who have lost \nsomebody who has fought for this country under our flag. About 80 \npercent of the American people are for this amendment. The remaining 20 \npercent either do not know, or are people who would not be for anything \nthat contrasts values.\n  Mr. President, all this amendment would do is allow the Congress to \nenact a law prohibiting physical desecration of the American flag. We \nare going to take out of the amendment the three words ``and the \nStates,'' so that we will not have 51 different interpretations of what \nflag desecration is. This change will be made at the request of a \nnumber of Senators who are concerned, as I am, about that possibility. \nAt the appropriate time, an amendment to make that change will be \nfiled.\n  All this amendment does is restore the symbol of our American flag to \na constitutionally protected status. And it allows the Congress, if it \nchooses to--it does not have to, but if it chooses to--to enact \nimplementing legislation to protect the flag. \n\n[[Page S 18255]]\n\n  There is no one in Congress who is going to go beyond reason in \nprotecting the flag. We will still have our emblems on athletic \nequipment. We will still have little flags. We will still be able to \nhave scarves and other beautiful and artistic renditions of the flag. \nWhat we will not have is the ability to physically desecrate the \nAmerican flag.\n  All we are asking here is to let the American people decide this. If \nwe have enough support, 66 people in favor, we will pass this amendment \nthrough the Senate. That is, of course, only the beginning of the \nprocess, because three-quarters of the States will then have to ratify \nthis amendment before it becomes the 28th amendment to the \nConstitution. I believe three-quarters of the States will ratify it, \nbecause almost all of the States have already called for this amendment \nthrough effective legislative enactment.\n  But what will ensue once this amendment passes--something that is \nworth every effort we put forward--is a tremendous debate in our \ncountry about values, about patriotism, about what is right or wrong \nwith America, about things that really will help us to resurrect some \nof the values that have made America the greatest country in the world. \nIt will be a debate among the people.\n  For those who do not want a constitutional amendment passed, they \nwill have a right to go to every one of our 50 States and demand that \npeople not allow us to protect the flag from desecration. They will \nhave an equal right with anybody else to make their case. We are here \nto make the decision to let that debate over values, over right and \nwrong, over patriotic thoughts and principles ensue. It is worth it.\n  I personally resent anybody indicating that this is just politics. I \nhave heard some people say, ``Well, if this was a secret ballot, it \nwould not pass at all.'' I do not agree with that. I believe there are \nenough people in this body who realize that we are talking about \nsomething pretty valuable here, something pretty personal, something \nthat really makes a difference in all of our lives; our national \nsymbol. The symbol that soldiers rally behind, fight under, went up San \nJuan Hill to retrieve. For those of us who have lost loved ones in \nvarious wars, this particular debate plays an especially significant \nrole.\n  There are those here who are themselves heroes, and who may disagree, \nand they have a right to do so. I think they do so legitimately in \ntheir eyes, and certainly sincerely. I respect them and respect their \nviewpoints, just as I hope that those on the other side will respect \nthe viewpoints of those of us who believe that this is an important \nthing, that this is a value in America that is important, that ought to \nbe upheld.\n  In my case, our family has seen suffering. I can remember as a young \nboy playing in the woods down in front of our very, very humble home \nthat my dad had built from a burned-out building. In fact, for the \nearly years of my life our house was black. I always thought all houses \nwere black, or should have been. One side of it had, as I recall, a \nMeadow Gold Dairy sign on the whole side of the house, because he had \nto take that wood from another building. It was either that or a \nPillsbury Flour sign. I believe it was a Meadow Gold Dairy sign. It was \none or the other. I always thought that was a pretty nice thing to have \non our house as a young kid.\n  I was down in front of the house playing in the woods, when I heard \nmy mother and dad. I could tell there was something wrong. I ran out of \nthe woods and ran up to the front porch of our house, this humble \nplace, and there was a representative of the military informing my \nfolks that my brother, my only remaining brother, who we all loved \ndearly, Jess Hatch, Jess Morlan Hatch, was missing in action. It was a \nsad occasion. My folks were just broken up about it. They loved all \nnine of us kids, two of whom had predeceased Jess, who was missing in \naction.\n  When my brother was home, my mother had some beautiful yellow roses \nthat she had grown. She really had a green thumb. She could raise \nbeautiful flowers. He used to kid her about taking those yellow roses \nand giving them to his girlfriend, or taking the plants and giving them \nto his girlfriend. She always laughed. She knew he would never do it. \nBut, for a couple of months after my brother was listed as missing in \naction, my mother received a dozen yellow roses from my brother. She \nbelieved right up until the day that they found his body and brought \nhim back that he was still alive.\n  He had flown in that fateful Foggia, Italy mission and helped knock \nout the oil fields that really helped to shorten the war. He flew in a \nB-24 bomber. He was a hero, and one of the few people who ever shot \ndown a German jet, which were new planes. I have his Purple Heart in \nour home out in Salt Lake City, as well as a number of his military \nmemorabilia. I also have all of his letters to my mom and dad. I have \nread every one of them within this last year, and it was interesting to \nsee how he was evolving as a high school graduate to the great person \nthat he really was.\n  My mom and dad died--my mother last June and my dad 2 years before. \nThey would have given their lives to save the American flag. My brother \ndid. One of my most prized possessions is the American flag that draped \nmy brother's coffin. I have that in my home out at Salt Lake as well, \nalong with his medals.\n  There have been hundreds of thousands of Americans who died to \npreserve liberty around the world who fought--maybe not for the flag, \nbut under the flag--and who have revered the American flag. Who could \nforget the Iwo Jima Monument, commemorating the soldiers who risked \ntheir lives to see that our Nation's flag was lifted and flown above \nthat island, a symbol for all of them.\n  You can go through literally thousands of stories on why the flag is \nimportant. I do not want to make this so emotional, but the fact is \nthat it is emotional. I think it is wrong for anybody to come here and \nsay that this is just a political exercise. That is not a knock at my \ndear friends who feel that way. I am sure they are sincere, but I think \nthey are sincerely wrong.\n  Paul was sincere, I guess, when he held the coats of the people who \nstoned the first Christian martyr. He was as sincere as anyone could \nbe. He held their coats. He believed in what they were doing. He \npersecuted the saints. But Paul was sincerely wrong, and I believe \nanybody that denigrates the intentions of those who want to preserve \nand protect the flag is, in this case, sincerely wrong.\n  I guess what I am saying here is that this is a much more important \nissue than just a political issue. To me, politics does not even enter \ninto this. It is an issue of whether we value the values of our \ncountry, the things that made this country great. It is an issue of \nwhether we want to have this debate over values, whether we want to let \nthe American people really decide for themselves whether the flag is \nimportant or whether it is not.\n  In a day and age where we seem to be denigrating values all the time, \nwhy should we not stand up for one of the values that really has helped \nmake this country great, that has meant something from the beginning of \nthis Nation? Why should we not have that debate? For those who \ndisagree, however sincerely their opposition, I invite them to join the \ndebate. Prove us wrong, not only here on the floor, but do it, once \nthis amendment passes, with the American people. I think they are going \nto find that the vast majority of the American people do not agree with \nthem.\n  Last but not least, there are those who would argue that this is a \ndenigration of the First Amendment, or that nobody has ever amended the \nBill of Rights. Let me tell you something. The Bill of Rights was no \nsooner passed when the 11th amendment was passed to overcome a faulty \nSupreme Court decision. A number of the other amendments have been \npassed since then to overcome Supreme Court decisions that were wrong. \nIt is a legitimate thing.\n  Keep in mind that Earl Warren, Abe Fortas, Hugo Black, three of the \nmost liberal members ever on the Supreme Court, wrote that they \nbelieved the flag could be protected. It had nothing to do with first \namendment rights or freedoms in the sense of denigrating the first \namendment.\n  The fact that in the Johnson case, the Supreme Court alluded to the \nfirst \n\n[[Page S 18256]]\namendment, and spoke of the first amendment right of free speech being \nviolated, does not make it right. How can anybody say that we are \ntrying to stop any person from saying whatever they want to, to \ndenigrate the flag. They can denigrate the flag all they want to, with \nall the free speech in the world, and I am certainly going to uphold \ntheir right to do it.\n  What we are against here, and what we need to establish through a \nconstitutional amendment, is that this does not involve speech. It \ninvolves improper and offensive conduct. And that is what Justices \nWarren, Fortas, and Black basically said. This is not a violation of \nfirst amendment protected free speech. Anybody can speak any way they \nwant. Physically desecrating the American flag, however, is a violation \nof the sensitivities and the values of America by means of offensive, \nimproper conduct, physically treating our national symbol with \ncontempt.\n  And even though desecrations of the flag occur more than they should, \nbut certainly not in overwhelming numbers, every one of them is \nreported by the media, seen by millions of people.\n  So it is a lot bigger issue than some would make it on the floor. I \nhave to say, I hope that our colleagues will vote for this amendment. \nIt is worthwhile to do it. All we are going to do is give Congress the \nright to define this matter once and for all, and then we are going to \nhave a debate in this country about values, one that I think is long \noverdue. I hope that our colleagues will consider that, and I \npersonally believe we can pass this amendment, although it is always \nuphill on a constitutional amendment. We understand that, and that we \nmay have to keep bringing this amendment forth. Ultimately, however, \nthis amendment is going to pass. I guarantee it is going to pass \nsomeday, even if it does not pass this time. But I personally believe \nwe have a good shot at it this time.\n  Mr. President, I will yield the floor to my colleague from Wisconsin.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I thank the Chair.\n  I certainly want to join with the chairman's comment that this is a \nworthy debate and one that people should join in if they have either \nstrong feelings in favor of or against the constitutional amendment \nregarding flag desecration.\n  Mr. President, in response to the chairman's challenge, I would like \nto rise today in opposition, strong opposition, to the proposed \nconstitutional amendment relating to the flag.\n  I do so with the utmost respect for my colleagues and especially the \ndistinguished chairman of the Judiciary Committee and the many \nAmericans who support this effort and, of course, in the spirit of my \nown utmost respect for the flag of this country.\n  Mr. President, I and all Members of this body share the enormous \nsense of pride that all Americans have when they see the flag in a \nparade or at a ball game or simply hanging from store fronts and \nporches all across their home State. It is one of my favorite sights \nregardless of the occasion. It makes me feel great to be an American \nwhen I see all those flags.\n  I appreciate that this is a deeply emotional issue, and rightly so. \nLike most Americans, I find the act of burning the American flag to be \nabhorrent and join with the millions of Americans who condemn each and \nevery act of flag desecration. I understand those who revere our flag \nand seek to hold it out as a special symbol of this Nation. It is a \nvery special symbol of our Nation.\n  However, I think the key to this whole issue is that we are not a \nnation of symbols--we are a nation of principles. Principles of \nfreedom, of opportunity, and liberty. These are the principles that \nframe our history and these are the principles, not the symbols but the \nprinciples, that define our great Nation. These are the principles \nfound in the U.S. Constitution and the Bill of Rights.\n  No matter how dearly we all hold the flag, it is these principles we \nmust preserve above all else, and it is adherence to these principles \nwhich forms the basis of my opposition to the proposed constitutional \namendment.\n  As a threshold, Mr. President, let me say that I view any effort, any \neffort at all, to amend the U.S. Constitution as something that we \nshould regard with trepidation. The chairman in his comments this \nmorning said to those of us who suggest that maybe if we do the flag \namendment, it might lead to other similar amendments, a slippery slope \nif you will. The chairman kept saying, ``Give me a break. Give me a \nbreak''--that this was unlikely; that the emotions that fuel this issue \nwould not fuel other attempts to amend the Constitution.\n  That those emotions would be just as worthy and just as heartfelt and \npatriotic and just as full of values as the emotions that drive this \neffort, I think is clear on its face and that this is a first step that \ncould lead to many other steps that could leave the first amendment in \ntatters.\n  Since the adoption of the Bill of Rights in 1791, the Constitution \nhas been amended on only 17 occasions. Yet, Mr. President, this is the \nthird amendment that has been considered by our Judiciary Committee in \nthe first term of the 104th Congress alone, with hearings being held on \nwhat could very well be a fourth constitutional amendment. According to \nthe Congressional Research Service, over 115 amendments--115 \namendments--have been introduced thus far just in the 104th Congress--\namendments to the U.S. Constitution.\n  While I do not question the sincerity of these efforts, there is much \nto be said for exercising restraint in amending this great document. \nThe Constitution has served this Nation well and withstood the test of \ntime, and the reason it has withstood the test of time is that we have \ntypically, almost always resisted the urge to respond to every \nadversity, be it real or imagined, with that natural instinct to say, \n``Let us pass a constitutional amendment.'' It is a gut feeling we have \nwhen we see a wrong. Let us just nail it down. Let us not pass a law--\nput it in the Constitution and forever deal with the issue.\n  However, history, as well as common sense, counsel that we only amend \nthe Constitution under very limited circumstances. I strongly believe \nthat those circumstances do not exist in the case of the so-called flag \nburning amendment. Proponents of this amendment argue that we must \namend the Constitution in order to preserve the symbolic value of the \nU.S. flag. However, they do so in the absence of any evidence that flag \nburning is rampant today or that it is likely to be in the future. But \nperhaps more importantly, this amendment is offered in the absence of \nany evidence, any evidence at all, that the symbolic value of the flag \nhas in any way been compromised in this great Nation. It has not. No \nevidence has been offered to show that the small handful of misguided \nindividuals who may burn a flag each year have any effect whatsoever on \nthis Nation's love of the flag or our Democratic way of life.\n  The inescapable fact of the matter is that the respect of this Nation \nfor its flag is unparalleled. The citizens of this Nation love and \nrespect the flag for varied and deeply personal reasons, some of which \nwere eloquently expressed today by the distinguished chairman of the \nJudiciary Committee. That is why they love the flag, not because the \nConstitution imposes the responsibility of love of the flag on them.\n  As a recent editorial in the La Crosse, WI, newspaper pointed out, \n``Allegiance that is voluntary is something beyond price. But \nallegiance extracted by statute--or, worse yet, by constitutional \nfiat--wouldn't be worth the paper the amendment was drafted on. It is \nthe very fact that the flag is voluntarily honored that makes it a \ngreat and powerful symbol.''\n  I think that is a great statement one of our Wisconsin newspapers \nmade.\n  Mr. President, the suggestion that we can mandate, through an \namendment to the Constitution, respect for the flag or any other symbol \nignores the premise underlying patriotism; more importantly, it belies \nthe traditional notions of freedom found in our own Constitution.\n  Mr. President, some would argue this debate is simply about \nprotecting the flag, that it is just a referendum over who loves the \nflag more. This faulty premise overlooks the underlying issue which I \nthink is at the heart of the debate, that being to what degree are we \nas a free society willing to retreat from fundamental principles of \nfreedom when faced with the actions of just a handful of misguided \nindividuals? \n\n[[Page S 18257]]\n\n  In my estimation, Mr. President, the answer is clear. The cost \nexacted by this amendment in terms of personal freedom--in terms of \npersonal freedom--is just far too great a price to pay to protect a \nflag which already enjoys the collective respect and admiration and \nlove of an entire nation. If adopted, this amendment will have an \nunprecedented direct and adverse effect on the freedoms embodied in the \nBill of Rights. These are freedoms which benefit each and every citizen \nof this Nation.\n  Yes, Mr. President, it is true, despite what the chairman said today, \nit is true that for the first time in our history, for the first time \nin this great Nation's history, the Constitution and the Bill of \nRights, both premised on limiting the Government--they are premised on \nlimiting the Government--will be used to limit individual rights, and, \nin particular, for the first time the constitutional process will be \nused to limit, not guarantee, but limit individual freedom of \nexpression.\n  I do not know how you could overstate the significance of such a new \ncourse in our constitutional history. As Dean Nichols of the Colorado \nCollege of Law noted before the Constitution Subcommittee of the \nJudiciary Committee, said, ``I think there would be a real reluctance \nto be the first American Congress to successfully amend the first \namendment.''\n  Do not let anyone kid you. That is what this would do. It would amend \nthe first amendment. It will have a different number, it will be listed \nin the high twenties, but it will change and alter the first amendment.\n  The chairman tries to address that by saying, well, shortly after the \nBill of Rights was passed, the 11th amendment was passed in 1798. That \nis accurate. But it did not change the right to free speech. It did not \nlimit the scope of the Bill of Rights.\n  In fact, the 11th amendment was consistent with the spirit of the \nBill of Rights by guaranteeing that the States cannot be compromised by \nthe Federal Government. The 11th amendment was not about limiting free \nexpression or any other freedom of the Bill of Rights. It states:\n\n       The Judicial power of the United States shall not be \n     construed to extend to any suit in law or equity, commenced \n     or prosecuted against one of the United States by Citizens of \n     another State, or by Citizens or Subjects of any Foreign \n     State.\n\n  It is not about free speech. The point is really that this would be \nthe first time--the first time--in this Nation's history that we would \nchange something I consider to be very sacred, the Bill of Rights. That \nwe would choose now, after 200 years of the most unparalleled liberty \nin human history, to limit the Bill of Rights in the name of patriotism \nis inherently flawed. And I think it is really, ironically very tragic.\n  Some will argue that we should not attach too much significance to \nthis unprecedented step, while still others argue that the amendment \nhas no effect whatsoever on the first amendment. This is despite the \nfact that this amendment, if adopted--make no mistake about it--if it \nis adopted, it would criminalize--make it a crime--the very same \nexpression that the Supreme Court has previously held to be explicitly \nprotected under the first amendment.\n  So it is clearly an erosion of the Bill of Rights. You may argue that \nit is a justified erosion or a necessary erosion, but it clearly limits \nwhat the U.S. Supreme Court has said is part and parcel of our freedom \nas an American to express ourselves.\n  Mr. President, I think it is essential to carefully consider the \nbasis for the adoption of the Bill of Rights before we go ahead and \nalter it for the first time in our Nation's history. Many who \noriginally opposed the Constitution, those not entirely comfortable \nwith the ratification, sought the Bill of Rights in particular because, \nin their view, the Constitution in its original form without the Bill \nof Rights, failed to properly consider and protect the basic and \nfundamental rights of the individuals of this country. That is why we \nhave a Bill of Rights.\n  Although many Federalists, including Madison, felt that the limited \npowers conferred to the Government by the Constitution, the limitations \nin the Constitution itself, were sufficiently narrow so as to leave \nthose rights safe and unquestioned, people still felt we had to go \nahead and have a Bill of Rights adopted in order to provide the \nreluctant States with the assurance and the comfort necessary so they \nwould approve the Constitution, so they would enter into this great \nFederal Union. And everyone today in the 104th Congress should \nunderstand this.\n  What is so much of the rhetoric of the 104th Congress about? The \nconcern that the Federal Government is too strong, that it does too \nmuch, that we ought to leave enough power to the States and to \nindividuals. That is what all the rhetoric is about today. Well, that \nis what the Bill of Rights was about also. And that is why we have \nnever changed it. Because the notion of the Contract With America is \nnot a new one. It is a heartfelt feeling of all Americans that the \nFederal Government must be tightly limited in its powers so that our \nliberties as individuals and as States cannot be compromised.\n  From this beginning in compromise, almost exactly 204 years ago, the \nBill of Rights has evolved into the single greatest protector of \nindividual freedom in human history. It has done so in large measure, I \nbelieve, because attempts to alter its character have to date been \nrejected. If this great document was changed every few years, as I am \nsure every Congress has been tempted to do, it would not be the great \nBill of Rights that not only Americans revere but people around the \nworld revere as well.\n  That individuals should be free to express themselves, secure in the \nknowledge that Government will not suppress their expression based \nsolely upon its content, is a premise on which the Nation was founded. \nThe Framers came to this land to escape oppression at the hands of the \nstate. Obviously, there is no dispute about that, that Government \nshould not limit one's ability to speak out. That is established in our \nConstitution by the simple words in the first amendment, ``Congress \nshall make no law * * * ''--no law--``* * * abridging the freedom of \nspeech * * *.''\n  Of course, over time this Nation has had to grapple with the exact \nparameters of free speech, regulating in regard to defamation or \nobscenity for example. However, the fact that some expression may be \nproscribed, can be stopped, does not obviate the presumptive invalidity \nof any content-based regulation.\n  In the words of Justice Scalia of the U.S. Supreme Court:\n\n       . . . the Government may proscribe libel; but it may not \n     make the further content discrimination of proscribing only \n     libel critical of the Government.\n\n  In other words, you cannot chose which messages you like and which \nmessages you do not like. You cannot say libel against this Government \nis different than other kinds of content that might also be libel. \nAlthough we need not concern ourselves with the exact parameters of \nspeech subject to limitation here because the expression in question, \npolitical expression, is clearly protected under the first amendment. \nThis points out the fact that the one defining standard that has marked \nthe history of free expression in this Nation is that speech cannot be \nregulated on the basis of its content.\n  The presumptive invalidity of content regulation protects all forms \nof speech, that which we all agree with, as well, of course, as the \nspeech we may disagree with or find objectionable. To do otherwise \nwould make the promise of free speech a hollow promise. What does it \nmean if we only protect that which we like to hear or is pleasant to \nour ears?\n  As the Supreme Court stated in Street versus New York:\n\n       . . . freedom to differ is not limited to things that do \n     not matter much. That would be a mere shadow of freedom. The \n     test of its substance is the right to differ as to things \n     that touch the heart of the existing order.\n\n  Yet, Mr. President, this amendment departs from that noble and time-\nhonored standard. It seeks instead to prohibit a certain kind of \nexpression solely, solely because of its content.\n  The committee report accompanying this amendment makes it explicit \nthat this effort is directed at that expression which is deemed \ndisrespectful--disrespectful. This amendment attempts to deal only with \ndisrespectful expression. Even more troubling is that this amendment \nleaves the determination of what is disrespectful to the \n\n[[Page S 18258]]\nGovernment, the very Government that we were trying to limit after we \nwon the Revolutionary War and got together and passed a constitution. \nIt is that Government that we are going to allow to define what is \nobjectionable by this amendment.\n  What could be more contrary to the very foundations of this country? \nFor the purpose of free expression to be fulfilled, the first amendment \nmust protect those who rise to challenge the existing wisdom, to raise \nthose points which may anger or even offend or be disrespectful.\n  As the great jurist, William O. Douglas, observed, free speech:\n\n       . . . may indeed serve its high purpose when it induces a \n     condition of unrest, creates dissatisfaction with conditions \n     as they are, or even stirs people to anger.\n\n  Mr. President, adherence to this ideal is exactly what separates \nAmerica from oppressive regimes across the world. We tolerate dissent, \nwe protect dissenters, while those other countries suppress dissent and \njail dissenters or, for example--and I can give you many examples, as I \nknow the Chair can--as recent events illustrate in Nigeria, the \ncondemnation of dissenters to a fate far more grave than incarceration: \nsummary execution.\n  The first amendment to the U.S. Constitution is not infallible. It \ncannot sanitize free expression any more than it can impart wisdom on \nthoughts which otherwise have none. Nor can the first amendment ensure \nthat free expression will always comport with the views of a majority \nof the American public or the American Government.\n  But what the first amendment does promise is the right of each \nindividual in this Nation to stand and make their case, regardless of \ntheir particular point of view, and to do so in the absence of a \nGovernment censor. In my estimation, this right is worthy of \npreserving, and I think that right is at risk today on the floor of the \nU.S. Senate.\n  When we start down the road to distinguishing between whose message \nis appropriate and whose is not, we risk something far greater than the \nright to burn a flag as political expression.\n  Much of what is clearly protected expression can easily be deemed \nobjectionable. For example, as I said many times before and a lot of \npeople have said before me, I deplore those who proudly display the \nswastika as they parade through our neighborhoods. I deplore these who \nhide behind white sheets and espouse their litany of hate and ignorance \nunder a burning--a burning--cross. I deplore those comments which \nsuggest that the most effective way to deal with law enforcement is to \nshoot them in the head. We hear that these days. Just as I object to \nspeech which seeks to equate particularly vile criminal acts with a \nparticular political ideology.\n  Each of these forms of expression, Mr. President, is reprehensible to \nme and to traditional American values of decency and tolerance. But \nthey are all protected forms of expression nonetheless, and they would \ncontinue to be protected after this amendment was passed and ratified. \nSo do I believe that we ought to outlaw them through an amendment to \nthe Constitution of the United States? Of course not.\n  So too it is with flag burning. As the Supreme Court has repeatedly \nstated, the act of flag burning cannot be divorced from the context in \nwhich it is occurring, and that is political expression. It was pretty \nclear from our Judiciary Committee hearings if somebody is out in the \nbackyard grilling on July 4th and accidentally burns their flag, that \nwould not be the necessary intent. There has to be some mental \nelement--it cannot just be an accident. So this amendment is about what \nsomebody is thinking. It is about what somebody is thinking when they \nburn the flag. It is about the content of their mind.\n  This Nation has a proud and storied history of political expression, \nmuch of which, obviously, can be characterized and is characterized \nsometimes as objectionable. Does any Member of this body believe that \nif the question had been put to the Crown as to whether or not the \nspeech and expression emanating from the Colonies in the form of the \nBoston Tea Party or the Articles of Confederation, should be sustained, \nthe answer, I think, we all know would have been a resounding no. Could \nnot the same be said of messages of the civil rights and suffrage \nmovements? This Nation was born of dissent and, contrary to the view \nthat it weakens our democracy, this Nation stands today as the leader \nof the free world because we tolerate those varying forms of dissent, \nnot because we persecute them.\n  In seeking to protect the U.S. flag, this amendment asks us to depart \nfrom the fundamental ideal that Government shall not suppress \nexpression solely because it is disagreeable.\n  As Justice Brennan wrote for the majority in Texas versus Johnson:\n\n       If there is a bedrock principle underlying the first \n     amendment, it is that the Government may not prohibit \n     expression of an idea simply because society finds the idea \n     itself offensive or disagreeable. We have not recognized an \n     exception to this principle even where our flag has been \n     involved.\n\n  In charting a divergent course, this amendment would create that \nexception, an exception at odds with free expression and with our \nhistory of liberty. If adopted, this amendment would, for the first \ntime in our history, signal an unprecedented, misguided and troubling \ndeparture from our history as a free society.\n  Mr. President, there are also definitional and practical flaws with \nthis amendment. Beyond the proposed amendment's departure from \ntraditional notions of free expression, there are practical aspects \nthat raise concerns, not just for those who may offer objectionable \npoints of view, not just for the purported or possible flag burners, \nbut for all Americans. This amendment will subject the constitutional \nrights of all Americans to potentially an infinite number of differing \ninterpretations, the parameters of which the proponents themselves \ncannot even define.\n  Without any guidance as to the definition of the key terms, the \nproposed amendment provides the Congress and the States the power to \nprohibit the physical desecration of the U.S. flag.\n  Testimony was received by the Constitution Subcommittee that the term \n``flag of the United States,'' as used in this amendment, is, as they \nsaid, ``problematic'' and so ``riddled with ambiguity'' as to ``war \nwith the due process norm that the law should warn before it strikes.'' \nEven supporters of this amendment, including former Attorney General of \nthe United States William Barr, have acknowledged that the term \n``flag'' could mean many different things. The simple fact of the \nmatter is that no one can lend any guidance as to what the term \n``flag'' will mean, other than to suggest that it will be up to various \njurisdictions.\n  Senator Hatch, the chairman, has indicated today that the States will \nbe removed from the amendment. If that is not the case, leaving them in \nwould raise a second practical problem with this effort to amend the \nBill of Rights, that being that the fundamental constitutional rights \nwould be explicitly subject to the geographic boundaries of political \nsubdivision.\n  The report accompanying this measure acknowledges that the extent to \nwhich this amendment will limit your freedom of expression could well \ndepend on where you live. Therefore, if you live in Madison, WI, your \nrights could be vastly different than the rights of your cousin who \nlives in Seattle, WA, for example.\n  Furthermore, the rights of the States to limit the first amendment \nwould not prohibit subsequent legislative bodies from expanding or \nfurther limiting rights under the first amendment. In other words, \nfundamental rights to free speech could vary from one election to the \nnext.\n  So I will await with interest the amendment regarding the States, but \nas the amendment is written now there will be at least--at least--for \nthe first time in our country's history, 51 interpretations of the \nfirst amendment.\n  I think this is counter to the very premise of the Bill of Rights, \nthat being that the rights of individuals should remain beyond the \npurview of unwarranted governmental intrusion or intervention. That is \nwhat led to the adoption of the Bill of Rights in the first place.\n  In the words of Justice Jackson, speaking for the Supreme Court in \n1943:\n\n       The very purpose of the Bill of Rights was to withdraw \n     certain subjects from the vicissitudes of political \n     controversy, to place them beyond the reach of majorities and \n     officials, to establish them as legal principles \n\n[[Page S 18259]]\n     to be applied by the courts. One's right to life, liberty and property, \n     to free speech, a free press, freedom of worship and \n     assembly, and other fundamental rights may not be submitted \n     to vote; they depend on the outcome of no elections.\n\n  Yet, this amendment does exactly that and subjects those fundamental \nrights to the outcome of elections. What comfort is a first amendment \nwhich tells the American public that the appropriateness of their \npolitical expression will be left up to the Government?\n  At the core of this proposed amendment is the desire to punish that \nexpression which is disrespectful. The ability to accomplish this \ntroubling goal turns upon the interpretation that would be given to the \nterm ``desecration.'' Mr. President, despite attempts to argue that it \nmeans to ``treat with contempt'' or ``disrespect'' or to violate the \n``sanctity'' of the flag, it is just obvious that this is subject to \ninterpretation. The word ``desecration'' could not be more subject to \ninterpretation. It is almost an inherently vague term.\n\n  If, as the report accompanying this measure suggests, every form of \ndesecration is not the target of this amendment, then it logically \nfollows that the Government--the Federal Government --will make \ndistinctions between types of political expression, and the distinction \nwill be this: that which is acceptable and that which is not. The flaws \nin this process should be obvious to every American.\n  So long as your political expression comports with that of the \ngoverning jurisdiction, you are going to have your freedom of \nexpression, and it will be preserved. We can certainly debate this \npoint, but in punishing only that expression which is \n``disrespectful,'' someone--in this case the Government--has to decide \nwhat is disrespectful and what is not.\n  For those of us who think that this is an easy distinction and there \nis not going to be a problem deciding what is desecration and what is \ndisrespectful, I have an example. A Vietnam war veteran, a friend of \nmine from Wisconsin, Marvin J. Freedman, recently wrote in an article, \naptly entitled, ``The Fabric of America Cannot Be Burned,'' that the \nfatal flaw in this amendment will be its application. In Mr. Freedman's \nwords:\n\n       The real potential for crisis is one of context. Consider \n     the star spangled bandanna. Let's say a highly decorated \n     veteran is placing little American flags on the graves at a \n     veterans cemetery for Memorial Day, works up a sweat and \n     wipes his brow with one of those red, white, and blue \n     bandannas. If the flag amendment were on the books, would the \n     veteran's bandanna be deemed a ``flag of the United States''? \n     Probably not. But if it were, would his actions be \n     interpreted as ``desecration''? I cannot imagine anyone \n     thinking so.\n\n  Mr. Freedman continues:\n\n       However, if a bedraggled-looking antiwar protester wiped \n     his brow with the same bandanna after working up a sweat and \n     denouncing a popular President and the United States \n     Government's military policy, a different outcome could be a \n     distinct possibility. Whether the bandanna would be deemed a \n     ``flag'' and the sweat-wiping considered desecration would \n     very likely be directly related to the relative popularity of \n     the President and the war being protested. That is where the \n     flag amendment and the first amendment would bump into each \n     other.\n\n  Mr. President, we are all free to draw our own conclusions as to the \nvalidity of Mr. Freedman's hypothetical. I think it does a good job in \npointing out, in very simple terms, that which the Supreme Court has \noften stated: You cannot divorce flag desecration from the political \ncontext in which it occurs. Ultimately, value judgments have to be \nmade, and I think these are judgments that this amendment, \nunfortunately, reserves to the Government. For the first time in our \nhistory, it gives that judgment to the Government, not to individuals, \nnot to the citizens of this country.\n  Mr. President, the rights at the heart of this debate are far too \nfundamental and far too important to be subjected to the uncertainty \ncreated by this amendment. We must not abandon 2 centuries of free \nexpression in favor of an unwarranted and ill-defined standard which \nallows Government to choose whose political message is worthy of \nprotection and whose is not. This is counter to the very freedoms the \nflag symbolizes.\n  The very idea that a handful of misguided people could cause this \nNation--a Nation which has, from its inception, been a beacon of \nindividual liberty, and a Nation which has defended, both at home and \nabroad, the right of individuals to be free--to retreat from the \nfundamental American principle that speech should not be regulated \nbased upon its content is really cause for great concern.\n  I cannot believe we are going to let a few people who are not even \naround, as far as we know, not even doing this flag desecration, cow us \ninto passing this amendment. That would give the victory to the flag \nburners. It would be score one for the flag burners if we are foolish \nenough to amend the Constitution and Bill of Rights, for the first time \nin our history, just to deal with such misguided people.\n  Again, Mr. President, there is no doubt that the American people care \ndeeply about the flag. But I really believe they care just as deeply \nabout the Constitution. I was recently contacted by a man from Sturgeon \nBay, WI, a veteran of the Navy. What did he have to say? He wrote:\n\n       The most important part of the Constitution is the Bill of \n     Rights, the first ten amendments. The most important one of \n     those is the first amendment. Burning a flag, in my opinion, \n     is expressing an opinion in a very strong way. While I may \n     disagree with that opinion, I must support the right to \n     express that opinion. To me, the first amendment is the most \n     important thing. The flag is a symbol of that and all other \n     rights, but only that, a symbol.\n\n  My constituent, I think, said it quite well. I appreciated very much \nthe time and effort taken to write to me, not because we share the same \nperspective, but because the letter makes the very important point \nthat, in the final analysis, and as the proponents of the amendment \nreadily concede, the flag is but a symbol of this Nation. As I said at \nthe outset, Mr. President, we are not a nation built on symbols; we are \na nation built on principles.\n  We will be paying false tribute to the flag, in my opinion, if in our \nzeal to protect it we diminish the very freedoms it represents. The \ntrue promise of this great and ever-evolving Nation is rooted in its \nConstitution. Ultimately, the fulfillment of this promise lies in the \npreservation of this great document, not just of that which symbolizes \nit. If we sacrifice our principles, ultimately, our symbols will \nrepresent something less than they should.\n  Therefore, Mr. President, I must respectfully oppose this effort to \namend the Bill of Rights. While I do not oppose this effort with \nanything less than the utmost respect for the American flag, my belief \nthat we must be vigilant in our preservation of the Bill of Rights and \nthe individual freedoms found therein really dictates my opposition.\n  Mr. President, to conclude, the measure before us limits the Bill of \nRights. It actually limits the Bill of Rights in an unprecedented, \nunwarranted, and ill-defined manner. As such, I intend to oppose this \nresolution.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a series of editorials \nfrom throughout the State of Wisconsin, all opposed to flag burning and \nalso to this amendment, be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the articles were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n           [From the Wisconsin State Journal, June 14, 1995]\n\n            Our Opinion: Flag Burning Amendment Unpatriotic\n\n       Today, Flag Day, is an occasion to celebrate liberty. And \n     one of the best ways you can celebrate liberty is to writer \n     your congressman to urge a vote against the proposed \n     constitutional amendment to ban flag burning.\n       It may seem unpatriotic to stand up for a right to burn the \n     American flag. But the proposed amendment is not about \n     whether it is patriotic to burn a flag. It is about whether \n     it is right to limit the liberties for which our flag flies. \n     A true patriot would answer no. Consider:\n       It's futile, even counter-productive, to try to require \n     patriotism by law.\n       In fact, it would inspire greater respect for our nation to \n     refrain from punishing flag burners. As conservative legal \n     scholar Clint Bolick of the institute for Justice told a \n     House subcommittee, we can lock up flag burners and by doing \n     so make them martyrs, ``or we can demonstrate by tolerating \n     their expression, the true greatness of our republic.''\n       Laws to protect the flag would be unworkable.\n       The proposal now before the House seeks a constitutional \n     amendment to allow Congress and the states to pass laws \n     banning physical desecration of the flag. It would require \n     approval by two-thirds of the House and Senate and three-\n     fourths of the states. \n     \n[[Page S 18260]]\n\n       It's called the flag burning amendment because many of its \n     supporters consider burning the flag to be the most egregious \n     form of desecration.\n       But what counts as desecration of the flag? What if someone \n     desecrated something made up to look like a flag with some \n     flaw, like the wrong number of stars or stripes? Does that \n     count? What if a flag is used in art that some people \n     consider rude or unpatriotic? Does that count as desecration?\n       The arguments could rage on and on, enriching lawyers and \n     diminishing the nation.\n       A ban on flag burning would set a dangerous precedent.\n       The proposed amendment is a reaction to 1989 and 1990 \n     Supreme Court rulings that invalidated federal and state laws \n     banning flag desecration. The court rules that peaceful flag \n     desecration is symbolic speech, protected by the First \n     Amendment freedom of speech clause.\n       Supporters of a ban on flag burning argue that burning a \n     flag is not symbolic speech at all but hateful action. But if \n     today's cause is to ban flag burning because it is hateful \n     action, tomorrow's cause may be to ban the display of the \n     Confederate flag because many people consider it to be \n     hateful action. Or to ban the use of racial or sexist \n     comments because they amount to hateful actions. And on and \n     on until we have given up our freedoms because we are \n     intolerant.\n       The right to protest is central to democracy.\n       A democracy must protect the right to protest against \n     authority, or it is hardly a democracy. It is plainly \n     undemocratic to take away from dissenters the freedom to \n     protest against authority by peacefully burning or otherwise \n     desecrating a flag as the symbol of that authority.\n       If the protesters turn violent or if they steal a flag to \n     burn, existing laws can be used to punish them.\n       Flag burners are not worth a constitutional amendment.\n       A good rule of thumb about amending the U.S. Constitution \n     is: Think twice, then think twice again. Flag burning is not \n     an issue that merits changing the two-centuries-old blueprint \n     for our democracy.\n       This nation's founding fathers understood the value of \n     dissent and, moreover, the value of the liberty to dissent. \n     So should we.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n     Our View: The American Flag--Old Glory Doesn't Need Amendment\n\n            [From the La Crosse (WI), Tribune, June 7, 1995]\n\n       The U.S. Supreme Court ruled in a Texas case in 1989 that \n     flag burning is protected by the First Amendment as a form of \n     speech.\n       The court's decision didn't go over very well with friends \n     of Old Glory then, and six years later that ruling still \n     sticks in the craw of many patriots--so much so that \n     constitutional amendments protecting the flag against \n     desecration have picked up 276 cosponsors in the U.S. House \n     of Representatives and 54 in the Senate.\n       The House Judiciary Committee takes up the amendment today, \n     with a floor vote expected on June 28. The Senate Judiciary \n     Committee tackled a similar amendment on Tuesday.\n       For two centuries soldiers have given their lives to keep \n     the American flag flying. It is a symbol of freedom and hope \n     for millions. That is what infuses the stars and stripes with \n     meaning and inspires the vast majority of Americans to treat \n     it with respect.\n       But to take away the choice in the matter, to make respect \n     for the flag compulsory, diminishes the very freedom \n     represented by the flag.\n       Do we follow a constitutional amendment banning flag \n     desecration with an amendment requiring everyone to actually \n     sing along when the national anthem is played at sports \n     events? An amendment making attendance at Memorial Day \n     parades compulsory?\n       Sen. Howell Heflin, D-Ala., argues that the flag unites us \n     and therefore should be protected. But Heflin and like minded \n     amendment supporters are confusing cause and effect. The flag \n     is a symbol of our unity, not the source of it.\n       Banning flag burning is simply the flip side of the same \n     coin that makes other shows of patriotism compulsory. What \n     are the names of the countries that make shows of patriotism \n     compulsory? Try China. Iraq. The old Soviet Union.\n       Coerced respect for the flag isn't respect at all, and an \n     amendment protecting the American flag would actually \n     denigrate that flag.\n       Allegiance that is voluntary is something beyond price. But \n     allegiance extracted by statute--or, worse yet, by \n     constitutional fiat--wouldn't be worth the paper the \n     amendment has drafted on. It is the very fact that the flag \n     is voluntarily honored that makes if a great and powerful \n     symbol.\n       The possibility of the Balkanization of the American people \n     into bickering special interest groups based on ethnicity or \n     gender or age or class frightens all of us, and it's tempting \n     to try to impose some sort of artificial unity. But can the \n     flag unite us? No. We can be united under the flag, but we \n     can't expect the flag to do the job of uniting us.\n       We oppose flag burning--or any other show of disrespect for \n     the American flag. There are better ways to communicate \n     dissent than trashing a symbol Americans treasure. But making \n     respect for the flag compulsory would, in the long run, \n     decrease real respect for the flag.\n       The 104th Congress should put the flag burning issue behind \n     it and move on to the nuts-and-bolts goal it was elected to \n     pursue: a smaller, less intrusive, fiscally responsible \n     federal government. A constitutional amendment protecting the \n     flag runs precisely counter to that goal.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n           [From the Oshkosh (WI) Northwestern, May 28, 1995]\n\n                  Beware Trivializing Our Constitution\n\n       It is difficult to come out against anything so sacrosanct \n     as the American flag amendment--difficult but not impossible.\n       An amendment to protect the flag from desecration is before \n     Congress and has all the lobbying in its favor.\n       The trouble is, it is an attempt to solve, through the \n     Constitutional amendment process, a problem that really is \n     not a problem.\n       Flag burning is not rampant. It occurs occasionally; it \n     brings, usually, society's scorn upon the arsonist, and does \n     no one any harm, except the sensitivities of some.\n       These sensitivities give rise to the effort to abridge the \n     freedom of expression guaranteed by the First Amendment, \n     which has been held by the courts to include expressions of \n     exasperation with government by burning its banner.\n       At worst, this flag protection is an opening wedge in \n     trimming away at the basic rights of all Americans to \n     criticize its leaders. That right was so highly esteemed by \n     the Founding Fathers that they made free speech virtually \n     absolute.\n       At best, the flag protection amendment trivializes the \n     Constitution.\n       That is no small consideration. The Constitution was \n     trivialized once before. The prohibition amendment had no \n     business being made a constitutional chapter. It was not of \n     constitutional stature. It could have been done by statute \n     alone. Its repeal showed that it was a transitory matter \n     rather than being one of transcendent, eternal concern.\n       The flag protection amendment is trivial in that flag \n     burning is not always and everywhere a problem. If the \n     amendment succeeds, what else is out there to further \n     trivialize the document?\n       Must the bald eagle be put under constitutional protection \n     if it is no longer an endangered bird?\n       This is a ``feel good'' campaign. People feel they \n     accomplish something good by protecting the flag from \n     burning. (Isn't the approved method of disposing of tattered \n     flags to burn them, by the way?)\n       But it offers about the same protection to flags that the \n     18th offered to teetotaling.\n       If someone has a political statement to make and feels \n     strongly enough, he'll do the burning and accept the \n     consequences. The consequences surely will not be draconian \n     enough that flag burning would rank next best thing to a \n     capital offense.\n       Congress has more pressing things to do than put time into \n     this amendment.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n       [From the Milwaukee (WI) Journal Sentinel, June 12, 1995]\n\n                       Flag Amendment Ill-Advised\n\n       Probably nine-tenths of the knuckleheads who get their \n     jollies from burning the American flag or desecrating it in \n     other ways have no idea what freedoms that flag symbolizes. \n     Because these people are stupid as well as ungrateful, they \n     never think about the precious gift they have been given.\n       The irony is that the American flag stands for, among other \n     things, the freedom to express yourself in dumb and even \n     insulting ways, like burning the flag. This is a freedom \n     literally not conferred on hundreds of millions of people.\n       A few years ago, several states passed laws that made it \n     illegal to desecrate the flag, but in 1989 the Supreme Court \n     ruled that such statutes violated the Bill of Rights. \n     Congress is now moving to amend the Constitution itself, so \n     that flag desecration laws can be enacted.\n       That movement is as ill-considered as it is understandable. \n     The Constitution should be amended only reluctantly and \n     rarely, when a genuine threat to our nation emerges and when \n     there is no other way to guard against it.\n       That is why the founding fathers made it so difficult to \n     revise the Constitution, and why, as a Justice Department \n     spokesman pointed out the other day, the Bill of Rights has \n     not been amended since it was ratified in 1792.\n       The unpatriotic mischief of adolescent punks is \n     infuriating. But it is not a serious enough act to warrant \n     revision of the nation's charter.

Mr. President, I would like to respond briefly to the \nremarks of the Senator from Wisconsin and other arguments in opposition \nto this proposed amendment and to speak briefly in favor of the \namendment. Senator Roth from Delaware is here to speak to an important \nsubject as well. So what I will do is truncate my remarks, and Senator \nHatch will be here a little bit later to speak at greater length on the \nconstitutional amendment. \n\n[[Page S 18261]]\n\n  Mr. President, I think we need to start with some fundamentals. I \nhave never questioned the sincerity, or the judgment, or reasoning, or \nconclusions, even, of those who oppose a constitutional amendment on \ndesecration of the flag. There are very sound constitutional arguments \non both sides of this issue. It is one of those classical issues on \nwhich people on both sides can marshal evidence, historical commentary, \nand reasoning to support their views. In my view, it is not an easy \nquestion to resolve. But I do take some offense at the suggestion that \nthose who propose the amendment--just to use one quotation used \nbefore--are involved in misguided rhetoric, and terminology of that \nsort. We can disagree over something of this importance, without \nsuggesting that those who hold a different view are dangerous, \nmisguided, or simply engaged in rhetoric.\n  I think, to some extent, that while nothing--except perhaps declaring \nwar--is a more solemn right and responsibility of the Congress than \namending the Constitution, it is also possible that some in Congress, \nfrom time to time, become consumed by their own importance. It is easy \nto do. Yet, I think it is equally important for us to recognize that we \ndo not amend the Constitution, that while it is important for us to \nraise all of these questions and to debate this as solemnly as we can, \nthat we do not amend the Constitution, Mr. President. The people amend \nthe Constitution. All we can do is recommend an amendment. It is the \npeople who make the ultimate decision.\n\n  To put it in the simplest terms, what we are suggesting is we ask the \nAmerican people: Do you want to amend the Constitution to protect the \nflag? If the people say no, then it will not happen; if the people say \nyes, I suggest that we should rely upon their judgment in this matter, \nthe very people who, after all, elect us to represent them in all other \nmatters except amending the Constitution, which under our document is \nreserved to the people for final decision.\n  I think we have to put some trust in the American people here to do \nthe right thing.\n  It is interesting to me that historically in this country for 200 \nyears we got along very well living under a Constitution that protected \nfree speech, and yet in 49 of the 50 States, prevented desecration of \nthe flag. This is not a choice between protecting the flag and the U.S. \nConstitution, as was suggested a moment ago. That is a false choice. \nFor 200 years we did both. We can do both.\n  Since the decision of the Supreme Court which struck down the \nprotection of the flag, 49 States, including my State of Arizona, have \npassed memorializing resolutions calling on Congress to pass a flag \ndesecration amendment so that the States could consider it.\n  In 1991, Arkansas, while President Clinton was still serving as \nGovernor, became the 11th of 49 States to ``urge Congress of the United \nStates to propose an amendment to the U.S. Congress, for ratification \nby the States, specifying that the Congress and the States shall have \nthe power to prevent the physical desecration of the flag of the United \nStates.''\n  I also note that the decision of the Supreme Court invalidated the \nlaw that then-Governor Clinton had signed months earlier which \nprohibited the intentional desecration of the flag, though the \nPresident now opposes this particular amendment.\n  The House passed a companion measure to that which is being \nconsidered here, on June 28, by a vote of 312 to 120. This has \nbipartisan support. The Senate Judiciary Committee, with equally \nbipartisan support, approved the amendment on July 20 by a vote of 12 \nto 6.\n  The purpose of this resolution is to restore the authority to adopt \nstatutes protecting the U.S. flag from physical desecration. As I said, \nit is not a choice between the flag and the Constitution. We proved for \n200 years that both are possible to protect.\n  The flag is worthy of protection. It is a unique national symbol, \nrepresentative, among other things, of the men and women who have \nserved this country. It is draped over the coffins of those who have \npaid the ultimate price to preserve our freedom and invokes very strong \nemotions in all Americans. It is important to protect the symbol for \nthese reasons.\n  You cannot burn or deface other national symbols which have far less \nemotional symbolic value than the flag, but we allow it because the \nSupreme Court said a few years ago we would allow the desecration of \nthe flag.\n  This resolution, frankly, is in direct response to the Texas versus \nJohnson decision in Texas of the Supreme Court. It was a 5-to-4 \ndecision. So literally, one unelected judge decided that a law that had \nexisted for over 200 years was now mysteriously unconstitutional.\n\n  The Court later ruled in United States versus Eichman that Congress \ncould not by statute protect the flag making it very clear that our \nonly response could be a proposed constitutional amendment.\n  Mr. President, I am not going to respond to each of the arguments \nmade because Senator Roth has some important things to say on another \nsubject. Let me just respond to a couple.\n  One of the arguments and probably the key argument of the proponents \nis that we would be trampling on the right of free speech by adopting \nthis amendment. I understand that argument. It is not a frivolous \nargument.\n  The argument of some opponents that flag burning is a nonproblem \nbecause it is hardly ever done and therefore why would we even want to \nbother with this, I think is a good argument against the notion that \nthis would be a significant intrusion on the first amendment.\n  It seems to me opponents cannot argue on the one hand that this is \ninsignificant, never happens, why are you worrying about it, and on the \nother hand say it would be the biggest travesty and impingement on free \nspeech to be visited on the U.S. Constitution and the people of \nAmerica.\n  You cannot have it both ways. The truth of the matter is it is true \nthat this is not a big problem, but it does not follow from that that \nwe should not offer the States the ability to restore the protection of \nthe flag that it enjoyed for 200 years. Mr. President, 49 States seem \nto think this is important enough to have memorialized Congress, asking \nfor the ability to once again restore that protection.\n  Now, the passing of a constitutional amendment would not prevent \nthose who hate America or who have particular grievances from \nexpressing this contempt through any other speech or even certain \nconduct as the Supreme Court has permitted. You do not have to burn the \nflag to express your views.\n  I suggest in civilized society people should be able to express \nthemselves in ways that are not so personally and viscerally offensive, \nfor example, to a family grieving over the flag-draped coffin of a \nloved one.\n  Mr. President, let me just conclude by quoting from some people who \nhave spoken to this issue before in a way which I think is instructive. \nThis is not misguided rhetoric by extremists or superpatriots. I refer, \nMr. President, to the words of Chief Justice Earl Warren, an eminently \nrespected jurist of this country: ``I believe that the States and the \nFederal Government do have the power to protect the flag from acts of \ndesecration and disgrace.''\n  A famous liberal jurist, a man greatly respected on the Supreme Court \nof the United States, Justice Hugo Black:\n\n       It passes my belief that anything in the Federal \n     Constitution bars a State from making the deliberate burning \n     of the American flag an offense. It is immaterial that the \n     words are spoken in connection with the burning. It is the \n     burning of the flag that the State has set its face against.\n\n  And Justice Abe Fortas, a respected liberal, a Democrat, not an \nextremist conservative patriot: ``* * * the States and the Federal \nGovernment have the power to protect the flag from acts of desecration \n* * *.''\n  Let me quickly also demonstrate this point further by noting the \nnames of many respected members of the Democratic Party who have \nsponsored or voted for this amendment. This is not a partisan issue, as \nI said: 93 House Democrats voted for the flag amendment, including \nRichard Gephardt the minority leader, Deputy Whips Bill Richardson and \nChet Edwards, and a host of other ranking and subcommittee members and \nkey members of the Democratic Party. Democrats and Republicans alike, \nliberals and conservatives, can appreciate the importance of doing \nthis.\n  And the final argument that was made that these words are so subject \nto \n\n[[Page S 18262]]\ninterpretation, ``desecration'' and ``flag''--who knows what ``flag'' \nmeans? Mr. President, the American experience of 200-plus years teaches \nus what the word ``flag'' means, and ``desecration'' has meaning which \ncan be interpreted by judges of good will.\n  The Bill of Rights and the 14th amendment to the U.S. Constitution \nare filled with general statements which the Framers of the \nConstitution and of the 14th amendment clearly understood need to be \nphrased relatively generally in order to deal with the variety of \ncircumstances to which they would be applied. Words like \n``establishment of religion,'' ``unreasonable searches and seizures,'' \nleaving ``unreasonable'' to the interpretation of the courts. ``Due \nprocess of law''--I can hear the arguments now. What do you mean by \n``due process''? What do you mean by ``just compensation,'' by ``speedy \ntrial''? You need to define it.\n\n  Mr. President, one of the geniuses of the Constitution is that it is \nnot defined with all of the precision that we apply to legislation, to \nlaws, and the even greater precision that is applied to regulations to \nexecute those laws. That is the genius of the Constitution.\n  So, all of the generalized phrases, the ``cruel and unusual \npunishment,'' ``equal protection of the laws,'' and other generalized \nstatements have served us very well for over 200 years. Certainly for \nwords like ``flag,'' which I suggest has a pretty specific meaning, and \neven ``desecration,'' which is less so, it is possible to interpret \nthose words in a meaningful and consistent way, particularly, as was \nnoted earlier, if we amend the proposal here to provide for the Federal \nGovernment, the Congress, rather than the States, to adopt the \nlegislation that would provide for the protection of the flag.\n  So, much more will be said about this amendment. Senator Hatch will \nbe here in a moment to discuss the amendment in more detail, to explain \nthe reasons why the Judiciary Committee was able to pass it out with \nsuch an overwhelming majority.\n  I am going to close by quoting from Chief Justice Rehnquist in his \ndissenting opinion from the decision in the Texas versus Johnson case, \nwhich precluded the Congress and the States from any longer protecting \nthe flag. I think these words are appropriate as we think about the \npossibility that American soldiers will again be sent to foreign lands \nto fight, and the concern for those people who we put in harm's way, \npeople who defend the ideals of our country. It is appropriate to \nreflect upon the value of the flag as a symbol to those people.\n  Let me quote again, as I said, from the dissenting opinion of Justice \nRehnquist in Texas versus Johnson. He said:\n\n       At Iwo Jima, United States Marines fought hand to hand \n     against thousands of Japanese. By the time the Marines \n     reached the top of Mt. Suribachi they raised a piece of pipe \n     upright and from one end fluttered a flag. That ascent had \n     cost nearly 6,000 lives.\n\n  Mr. President, that sacrifice could never be put adequately into \nwords, but the flag symbolizes perfectly what words cannot describe. \nAnd it is that symbol that we see when we go to the monument just a \ncouple of miles south of here and see the flag being raised over Mt. \nSuribachi that recalls so many memories and evokes so many emotions \namong Americans, that we come to the conclusion that this one very \nspecial symbol of America and everything for which it stands should \nreceive minimal protection by the people of the United States. That is \nwhy I urge my colleagues to follow the lead of the House of \nRepresentatives and submit this question to the people of the United \nStates to determine whether or not they want to amend the Constitution \nto protect the flag from desecration.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor to Senator Roth. At the time that \nSenator Hatch comes, he will speak further to the issue of the flag.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, first of all, let me express my appreciation \nto the distinguished Senator from Arizona for his courtesy and \ncompliment him on his most eloquent statement.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in morning \nbusiness.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/12/08/senate-section/article/S18253-4", "month": "12", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "08", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S18262-S18264]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             WELFARE REFORM\n\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, there are alarming signals coming from the \nWhite House that President Clinton may veto welfare reform. Instead of \nending welfare as we know it, the Administration apparently intends to \ncontinue politics as usual.\n  From the early days of his administration, President Clinton promised \nwelfare reform to the American people. On February 2, 1993, he told the \nNation's Governors that he would announce the formation of a welfare \nreform group within 10 days to work with the Governors to develop a \nwelfare reform plan. At that meeting, the President outlined four \nprinciples which would guide his administration to reform welfare.\n  The first principle as outlined by the President is that ``welfare \nshould be a second chance, not a way of life.'' In further defining \nwhat these means, the President stated that people should work within 2 \nyears and that, ``there must be--a time-certain beyond which people \ndon't draw a check for doing nothing when they can do something.'' On \nJuly 13, 1993, President Clinton went even further and told the \nNational Association of County Officials that a 2-year limit could be \nput on welfare. He said, ``you shouldn't be able to stay on welfare \nwithout working for more than a couple of years. After that, you should \nhave to work and earn income just like everybody else.'' He went on to \nsay, ``And if you put the building blocks in, you can have a 2-year \nlimit on welfare as we know it. You would end the system as it now \nexists.''\n  Mr. President, that is a strong statement and a bold challenge. H.R. \n4, the ``Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Act of 1995,'' \nmeets this first principle. We require people to work after 2 years and \nplace a 5-year limit on the receipt of Federal benefits. Let me repeal \nthis. We provide not a 2-year limit on benefits, but a 5-year limit. \nAnd, I might add, the conference report on H.R. 4 allows the States to \nexempt up to 15 percent of their caseload from this limit.\n  The President's support for time limits, by the way, is one of the \nmany ironies throughout the welfare reform debate. A good deal of \nattention has been focused on the analysis done by the Department of \nHealth and Human Services on the impact the various welfare bills would \nhave on families and children. The single greatest reason families \nwould become ineligible for benefits is the 5 year limit. It is a bit \ninconsistent for the President to embrace a time limit but invite \ncriticism of our proposal for a 5-year limit on benefits.\n  The second principle, as outlined by the President, is ``we need to \nmake work pay.'' The President indicated, that through the earned \nincome credit program, ``we ought to be able to lift people who work 40 \nhours a week, with kids in their home, out of poverty.''\n  The Republican balanced budget plan is consistent with this second \nprinciple outlined by the President. Under our plan, the EIC continues \nto grow. We are targeting the EIC program to those most in need.\n  The administration has criticized the Balanced Budget Act for its \nprovisions on EIC. But I believe it is both fair and accurate to point \nout that in expanding the EIC, the Clinton administration and the \nDemocratic 103d Congress went far beyond the President's stated goal as \nwell as beyond the original goals of this program. For example, they \nexpanded the credit to individuals who did not have children at home.\n  We have found unacceptable levels of errors, abuse, and waste in this \nprogram. Spending for the EIC is quite simply out of control. We have \nproposed a responsible and reasonable reform of the EIC program \nseparate from H.R. 4. Our welfare bill does not conflict with the \nPresident's principle on work.\n  The third principle of welfare reform outlined by President Clinton \nsome 34 months ago is that tougher child support enforcement is needed. \nH.R. 4 fully meets this principle. In an October 18, 1995 letter, the \nDirector of the Office of Management and Budget informed the majority \nleader that:\n\n       The Administration strongly supports bipartisan provisions \n     in both the House and Senate bills to streamline paternity \n     establishment, require new hire reporting, establish State \n     registries, make child support laws uniform across State \n     lines, and require \n\n[[Page S 18263]]\n     States to use the threat of denying drivers' and professional licenses \n     to parents who refuse to pay child support.\n\n  Clearly H.R. 4 meets the President's position on child support \nenforcement.\n\n  The fourth principle outlined by the President was his commitment to \nencourage experimentation in the States. To his credit, his \nadministration has approved a number of waivers to allow the States the \nflexibility to experiment. But waivers are not enough as the President \nhimself, as a former Governor, realizes.\n  When he spoke to the Governors again this year on June 6, in \nBaltimore, the President told the Governors,\n\n       You could not design a program that would be too tough on \n     work for me. You could not design a program that would give \n     the States any more flexibility than I want to give them as \n     long as we recognize that we . . . have a responsibility to \n     our children and to that in the end, our political and \n     economic policies must reinforce the culture we are trying to \n     create. They must be pro-family and pro-work.\n\n  At the same time, President Clinton also told the Governors that, \n``we can save some money and reduce the deficit in this welfare area.''\n  Then, on July 20 this year, he told the National Conference of State \nLegislatures that ``what I want to do in the welfare reform debate is \nto give you the maximum amount of flexibility, consistent with some \nsimple objectives. I do think the only place we need Federal rules and \nwelfare reform * * * is in the area of child support enforcement \nbecause so many of those cases cross State lines.''\n  The President went on to say, ``so I am going to do my best to get \nyou a welfare reform proposal which gives more flexibility to the \nStates and doesn't have a lot of ideological proscriptions * * * and \njust focuses on one or two big things that need to be done. I think \nthat is the right way to do it.''\n  Mr. President, we will provide the opportunity to make good on these \nwords.\n  The President has told the Governors he wants to protect the States \neven when there is an economic downturn. We have done this with an $800 \nmillion contingency fund and a $1.7 billion loan fund. President told \nthem he wanted funding for child care. H.R. 4 provides $17 billion for \nchild care for welfare and low-income families. This is over $700 \nmillion more than under current law. He told the Governors the problem \nwith a block grant was that States would cut their own funding and \ntherefore he wanted requirements for States to maintain their own \nfunding. H.R. 4 imposes such requirements. Furthermore, the conference \nagreement provides $3.5 billion in more funding for the block grants to \nStates for temporary assistance for needy families than under the \nSenate bill which passed 87-12.\n  The President indicated his interest in a performance bonus which \nforces the bureaucracy and recipients to focus on work. Establishing \nperformance standards is a subject which I have personally worked on \nfor years. H.R. 4 includes work-based performance standards.\n  It is clear we have responded positively to all of these concerns.\n  The President also indicated he was willing to give the States more \nflexibility in child nutrition, adoption, and child protective \nservices. H.R. 4 protects the current entitlements of foster care and \nadoption assistance maintenance payments. Between 1995 and 2002, \nfunding for foster care will increase by nearly 80 percent. Funding for \nchild nutrition will increase from less than $8 billion in fiscal year \n1995 to over $11 billion in 2002.\n  These are the fundamental principles the President outlined to the \nGovernors and to the Nation. Congress will shortly send a welfare \nreform bill which meets these principles. It would be regrettable if \nthe President walks away from all of these things which he so recently \npledged.\n  The need to reform the welfare system is as critical today as it was \nnearly 3 years ago when the President took office. The number of \nchildren receiving AFDC increased nearly threefold between 1965 and \n1993. By comparison, the total number of children in the United States \naged 0 to 18 declined by 5.5 percent during this period.\n  In 1965, the average monthly number of children receiving AFDC was \n3.3 million; in 1970, it was 6.2 million; in 1980, it was 7.4 million; \nand in 1993, there were nearly 9.6 million children receiving AFDC \nbenefits.\n  The Department of Health and Human Services has estimated that 12 \nmillion children will receive AFDC benefits by the year 2005 under \ncurrent law. If he vetoes welfare reform, President Clinton will be \naccepting the status quo in which another two and one-half million \nchildren will fall into the welfare system.\n  If the President vetoes welfare reform, he will be preserving a \nsystem which costs and wastes billions of taxpayers dollars. The \nGeneral Accounting Office has estimated, for example, that nearly $1.8 \nbillion in overpayments were made in the Food Stamp Program in 1993 \nalone.\n  A critical point of welfare reform is to give the States both the \nauthority and the responsibility for efficiently, compassionately, and \neffectively administering these programs. As a former Governor, the \nPresident surely knows well the duplication in the delivery of \nbenefits. It costs over $6 billion just to administer the AFDC and Food \nStamp Programs. When you include the cost of errors, fraud, and abuse \nin these two programs, another $3 billion is wasted.\n  We have therefore proposed an optional block grant for the Food Stamp \nProgram. At a town meeting this past June, the President told the \npeople of New Hampshire that his administration has given 29 states \nwaivers to use food stamps and welfare checks to employers as a wage \nsupplement. If it is good policy as a waiver, it is good policy to \nallow Governors to accept an optional block grant.\n  Another important area of reform is the Supplemental Security Income \nProgram. The SSI Program was established 21 years ago principally to \nprovide a welfare retirement program for aged and disabled adults who \nwere unable to contribute enough into the Social Security system. With \nthis purpose in mind, one would think that the cost of this program \nshould at least be stable as the elderly SSI population has actually \ndeclined by more than one-third since 1974.\n  Instead, SSI is the largest cash assistance program for the poor and \none of the fastest growing entitlement programs. Programs costs have \ngrown 20 percent annually in the last 4 years.\n  The SSI reforms in H.R. 4 are designed to slow the growth in the two \npopulations which have seen tremendous increases in recent years, \nnoncitizens and children. In 1982, noncitizens constituted 3 percent of \nall SSI recipients. In 1993, noncitizens constituted nearly 12 percent \nof the entire SSI caseload. From 1986 through 1993, the number of aged \nor disabled noncitizen recipients grew an average of 15 percent \nannually, reaching nearly 700,000 in 1993. Today, almost one out of \nevery four elderly SSI recipients is a noncitizen. GAO calculates that \nnoncitizens are actually more likely to receive SSI than citizens. The \nmajority of these elderly noncitizens, 57 percent, have been in the \nUnited States less than 5 years.\n  In total, our reforms directed at noncitizens will save the taxpayers \nmore than $20 billion. If President Clinton vetoes H.R. 4, these \nsavings will be lost.\n  According to the General Accounting Office, the growth in the number \nof disabled children receiving cash payments under SSI was moderate \nbefore 1990, averaging 3 percent annually between 1984 and 1990. Then, \nfrom the beginning of 1990 through 1994, the growth averaged 25 percent \nannually, and the number tripled to nearly 900,000. Their share of the \ndisabled SSI population grew from about 12 percent before 1990 to 22 \npercent in 1994. The number of children who are disabled and receive \nbenefits has increased by 166 percent just since 1990.\n  I would remind my colleagues that the changes in the definition of \nchildhood disability included in H.R. 4 was adopted on a bipartisan \nbasis.\n  The conference agreement maintains the commitment to children who are \ndisabled. All children currently receiving SSI benefits will continue \nto receive the full cash benefit to which they are entitled through \nJanuary 1, 1997.\n  The conference report increases Federal spending on welfare programs. \nExpenditures for the programs under H.R. 4 totaled $83.2 billion in \n1995. Under \n\n[[Page S 18264]]\nH.R. 4, they will increase by one-third to total $111.3 billion in \n2002. Between 1995 and 2002, total expenditures for these programs will \nbe $753.7 billion.\n  The conference report also provides support for other areas in which \nthe President has indicated support. The President has called for \naction to prevent teen pregnancies. We provide $75 million for \nabstinence education.\n  The President has called for tough child support enforcement. Our \nwelfare reform bill includes significant improvements in child support \nenforcement which will help families avoid and escape poverty.\n  The failure of an absent parent to pay child support is a major \nreason the number of children living in poverty has increased. Between \n1980 and 1992, the nationwide child support enforcement caseload grew \n180 percent, from 5.4 to 15.2 million cases. The sheer growth in the \ncaseload has strained the system.\n  There have been improvements in the child support enforcement system \nas collections have increased to $10 billion per year, but we clearly \nneed to do better. The House and Senate have included a number of child \nsupport enforcement reforms. These include expansion of the Federal \nParent Locator Service, adoption of the Uniform Interstate Family \nSupport Act--UIFSA--use of Social Security numbers for child support \nenforcement, improvements in administration of interstate cases, new \nhire reporting, and reporting arrearages to credit bureaus. Our \nconference report provides increased funding for child support data \nautomation.\n  As I have already mentioned, these provisions have been endorsed by \nthe administration. Let me also note that I recently received a letter \nfrom the American Bar Association in which the ABA states it ``strongly \nsupports the child support provisions in the conference report.'' The \nletter goes on to say, ``If these child support reforms are enacted, it \nwill be an historic stride forward for children in our nation.'' If the \nPresident vetoes welfare reform, he will forfeit this historic \nopportunity.\n  On January 24, 1995 President Clinton declared at a joint session of \nCongress, ``Nothing has done more to undermine our sense of common \nresponsibility than our failed welfare system.\n  Mr. President, vetoing welfare reform will seriously undermine the \nAmerican people's confidence in our political system. The American \npeople know the welfare system is a failure. They are also tired of \nempty rhetoric from politicians. Words without deeds are meaningless. \nThe time to enact welfare reform is now.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. McCONNELL addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, on Monday I will be offering an \namendment in the nature of a substitute to the underlying proposed \nconstitutional amendment, and I ask unanimous consent that this \namendment appear in the Record at this point. It will be cosponsored by \nSenator Bennett of Utah, Senator Dorgan, and Senator Bumpers.\n  There being no objection, the amendment was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n\n                           proposed amendment\n\n       Strike all after the enacting clause and inserting the \n     following:\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Flag Protection and Free \n     Speech Act of 1995''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Congress finds that--\n       (1) the flag of the United States is a unique symbol of \n     national unity and represents the values of liberty, justice, \n     and equality that make this Nation an example of freedom \n     unmatched throughout the world;\n       (2) the Bill of Rights is a guarantee of those freedoms and \n     should not be amended in a manner that could be interpreted \n     to restrict freedom, a course that is regularly resorted to \n     by authoritarian governments which fear freedom and not by \n     free and democratic nations;\n       (3) abuse of the flag of the United States causes more than \n     pain and distress to the overwhelming majority of the \n     American people and may amount to fighting words or a direct \n     threat to the physical and emotional well-being of \n     individuals at whom the threat is targeted; and\n       (4) destruction of the flag of the United States can be \n     intended to incite a violent response rather than make a \n     political statement and such conduct is outside the \n     protections afforded by the first amendment to the United \n     States Constitution.\n       (b) Purpose.--It is the purpose of this Act to provide the \n     maximum protection against the use of the flag of the United \n     States to promote violence while respecting the liberties \n     that it symbolizes.\n\n     SEC. 3. PROTECTION OF THE FLAG OF THE UNITED STATES AGAINST \n                   USE FOR PROMOTING VIOLENCE.\n\n       (a) In General.--Section 700 of title 18, United States \n     Code, is amended to read as follows:\n\n     ``Sec. 700. Incitement; damage or destruction of property \n       involving the flag of the United States\n\n       ``(a) Actions Promoting Violence.--Any person who destroys \n     or damages a flag of the United States with the primary \n     purpose and intent to incite or produce imminent violence or \n     a breach of the peace, and in circumstances where the person \n     knows it is reasonably likely to produce imminent violence or \n     a breach of the peace, shall be fined not more than $100,000 \n     or imprisoned not more than 1 year, or both.\n       ``(b) Damaging a Flag Belonging to the United States.--Any \n     person who steals or knowingly converts to his or her use, or \n     to the use of another, a flag of the United States belonging \n     to the United States and intentionally destroys or damages \n     that flag shall be fined not more than $250,000 or imprisoned \n     not more than 2 years, or both.\n       ``(c) Damaging a Flag of Another on Federal Land.--Any \n     person who, within any lands reserved for the use of the \n     United States, or under the exclusive or concurrent \n     jurisdiction of the United States, steals or knowingly \n     converts to his or her use, or to the use of another, a flag \n     of the United States belonging to another person, and \n     intentionally destroys or damages that flag shall be fined \n     not more than $250,000 or imprisoned not more than 2 years, \n     or both.\n       ``(d) Construction.--Nothing in this section shall be \n     construed to indicate an intent on the part of Congress to \n     deprive any State, territory or possession of the United \n     States, or the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico of jurisdiction \n     over any offense over which it would have jurisdiction in the \n     absence of this section.\n       ``(e) Definition.--As used in this section, the term `flag \n     of the United States' means any flag of the United States, or \n     any part thereof, made of any substance, in any size, in a \n     form that is commonly displayed as a flag and would be taken \n     to be a flag by the reasonable observer.''.\n       (b) Clerical Amendment.--The table of sections for chapter \n     33 of title 18, United States Code, is amended by striking \n     the item relating to section 700 and inserting the following \n     new item:\n``700. Incitement; damage or destruction of property involving the flag \n              of the United States.''.\n       Amend the title so as to read: ``A joint resolution to \n     provide for the protection of the flag of the United States \n     and free speech, and for other purposes.''.\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, every single Senator believes in the \nsanctity of the American flag. It is our most precious national symbol. \nThe flag represents the ideas, values and traditions that unify us as a \npeople and as a nation. Brave men and women have fought and given their \nlives and are now entering a war-torn region in defense of the freedom \nand way of life that our flag represents.\n  For all these reasons, those who desecrate the flag deserve our \ncontempt. After all, when they defile the flag, they dishonor America. \nBut the issue before this body is: How do we appropriately deal with \nthe misfits who burn the flag?\n  Many of my colleagues who support a constitutional amendment to ban \nflag-burning say the only way to ensure flag-burners get the punishment \nthey deserve is to amend the Bill of Rights for the first time in over \n200 years. The first amendment, which they propose to alter, contains \nour most fundamental rights: free speech, religion, assembly, and the \nright to petition the Government. The freedoms set forth in the first \namendment, arguably, were the foundation on which this great Republic \nwas established.\n  Amending the Constitution was made an arduous process by the Founding \nFathers for good reason. The requirements--approval by two-thirds of \neach House of Congress and ratification by three-fourths of the State \nlegislatures--ensure that highly emotional issues of the day will not \ntear at the fabric of the Constitution. Since the addition of the Bill \nof Rights, the Constitution has been amended on only 17 occasions.\n  Let me repeat, Mr. President, after the initial 10 amendments known \nas \n\n[[Page S 18265]]\nthe Bill of Rights, we have altered the Constitution only 17 times in \nthe history of our country.\n  And only one of those amendments--prohibition--actually constricted \nfreedom, and it was soon repealed. The 22d amendment also restricts \nfreedom by limiting the President to two terms, but we will have the \nterm limits debate another day.\n  The proposed constitutional amendment before us does just that--it \nrips the fabric of the Constitution at its very center: the first \namendment.\n  Our respect and reverence for the flag should not provoke us to cause \ndamage to the Constitution, even in the name of patriotism.\n  Mr. President, I seek no protection, no safe harbor, no refuge for \nthose who heap scorn on our Nation by desecrating the flag.\n  The only thing that those who provocatively burn the flag deserve is \nswift and certain punishment.\n  Therefore, the statutory amendment I have proposed would ensure that \nacts of deliberately confrontational flag-burnings are punished with \nstiff fines and even jail time.\n  My amendment will prevent desecration of the flag and at the same \ntime, protect the Constitution.\n  Those malcontents who desecrate the flag do so to grab attention for \nthemselves and to inflame the passions of patriotic Americans. And, \nspeech that incites lawlessness or is intended to do so, the Supreme \nCourt has made abundantly clear, merits no first amendment protection. \nFrom Chaplinsky's ``fighting words'' doctrine in 1942 to Brandenburg's \n``incitement'' test in 1969 to Wisconsin versus Mitchell's ``physical \nassault'' standard in 1993, the Supreme Court has never protected \nspeech which causes or intends to cause physical harm to others.\n  And, that, Mr. President, is the basis for this amendment, that I am \ndiscussing. My amendment outlaws three types of illegal flag \ndesecration. First, anyone who destroys or damages a U.S. flag with a \nclear intent to incite imminent violence or a breach of the peace may \nbe punished by a fine of up to $100,000, or up to 1 year in jail, or \nboth.\n  Second, anyone who steals a flag that belongs to the United States \nand destroys or damages that flag may be fined up to $250,000 or \nimprisoned up to 2 years, or both.\n  And third, anyone who steals a flag from U.S. property and destroys \nor damages that flag may also be fined up to $250,000 or imprisoned up \nto 2 years, or both.\n  Some of my colleagues will argue that we've been down the statutory \nroad before and the Supreme Court has rejected it.\n  However, the Senate's previous statutory effort wasn't pegged to the \nwell-established Supreme Court precedents in this area.\n  This amendment differs from the statutes reviewed by the Supreme \nCourt in the two leading cases: Texas versus Johnson (1989) and U.S. \nversus Eichman (1990).\n  In Johnson, the defendant violated a Texas law banning the \ndesecration of a venerated object, including the flag, in a way that \nwill offend--offend, Mr. President--one or more persons. Johnson took a \nstolen flag and burned it as part of a political protest staged outside \nthe 1984 Republican Convention in Dallas. The State of Texas argued \nthat its interest in enforcing the law centered on preventing breaches \nof the peace.\n  But the Government, according to the Supreme Court, may not--may \nnot--``assume every expression of a provocative idea will incite a riot \n* * *.'' Johnson, according to the Court, was prosecuted for the \nexpression of his particular ideas: dissatisfaction with Government \npolicies. And it is a bedrock principle underlying the first amendment, \nsaid the Court, that an individual cannot be punished for expressing an \nidea that offends. I repeat, the Court said you cannot be punished for \nengaging in offensive speech.\n  The Johnson decision started a national debate on flag-burning and as \na result, Congress, in 1989, enacted the Flag Protection Act. In \nseeking to safeguard the flag as the symbol of our Nation, Congress \ntook a different tack from the Texas Legislature. The Federal statute \nsimply outlawed the mutilation or other desecration of the flag.\n  But in Eichman, the Supreme Court found congressional intent to \nprotect the national symbol insufficient--insufficient--to overcome the \nfirst amendment protection for expressive conduct exhibited by flag-\nburning.\n  The Court, however, clearly left the door open for outlawing flag-\nburning that incites lawlessness. The Court said: ``the mere \ndestruction or disfigurement of a particular physical manifestation of \nthe symbol, without more, does not diminish or otherwise affect the \nsymbol itself in any way.''\n  But, Mr. President, you do not have to take my word on it. The \nCongressional Research Service has offered legal opinions to Senators \nBennett and Conrad concluding that this initiative will withstand \nconstitutional scrutiny:\n  ``The judicial precedents establish that the [amendment]''--referring \nto the amendment I have just been discussing--``if enacted, while not \nreversing Johnson and Eichman, should survive constitutional attack on \nfirst amendment grounds.''\n  In addition, Bruce Fein, a former official in the Reagan \nadministration and respected constitutional scholar concurs:\n  ``In holding flag desecration statutes unconstitutional in Johnson, \nthe Court cast no doubt on the continuing vitality of Brandenburg and \nChaplinsky as applied to expression through use or abuse of the flag. \n[The amendment] ``--referring to my amendment--falls well within the \nprotective constitutional umbrella of Brandenburg and Chaplinsky * * * \n[and it] also avoids content-based discrimination which is generally \nfrowned on by the First Amendment.''\n  Mr. President, several other constitutional specialists also agree \nthat this initiative will withstand constitutional challenge. A memo by \nRobert Peck, and Prof. Robert O'Neil and Erwin Chemerinsky concludes \nthat the amendment ``conforms to constitutional requirements in both \nits purpose and its provisions.''\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the CRS memos, the Bruce \nFein letter, and the legal memo from Robert Peck, Professors O'Neil and \nChemerinsky, and Johnny Killian be printed in the Record at this point.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                Great Falls, VA, October 21, 1995.\n     Senator Mitch McConnell,\n     U.S. Senate, Russell Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator: This letter responds for your request for an \n     appraisal of the constitutionality of the proposed ``Flag \n     Protection and Free Speech Act of 1995.'' I believe it easily \n     passes constitutional muster with flying banners or guidons.\n       The only non-frivolous constitutional question is raised by \n     section 3(a). It criminalizes the destruction or damaging of \n     the flag of the United States with the intent to provoke \n     imminent violence or a breach of the peace in circumstances \n     where the provocation is reasonably likely to succeed. In \n     Chaplinsky v. New Hampshire (1942), the Supreme Court upheld \n     the constitutionality of laws that prohibit expression \n     calculated and likely to cause a breach of the peace. Writing \n     for a unanimous Court, Justice Frank Murphy explained that \n     such ``fighting'' words ``are no essential part of any \n     exposition of ideas, and are of such slight social value as a \n     step to truth that any benefit that may be derived from them \n     is clearly outweighed by the social interest in order and \n     morality.''\n       In Brandenburg v. Ohio (1969), the Court concluded that the \n     First Amendment is no bar to the punishment of expression \n     ``directed to inciting or producing imminent lawless action \n     and is likely to incite or produce such action.''\n       In holding flag desecration statutes unconstitutional in \n     Texas v. Johnson (1989), the Court cast no doubt on the \n     continuing vitality of Brandenburg and Chaplinsky as applied \n     to expression through use or abuse of the flag. See 491 U.S. \n     at 409-410.\n       Section 3(a) falls well within the protective \n     constitutional umbrella of Brandenburg and Chaplinsky. It \n     prohibits only expressive uses of the flag that constitute \n     ``fighting'' words or are otherwise intended to provoke \n     imminent violence and in circumstances where the provocation \n     is reasonably likely to occasion lawlessness. The section is \n     also sufficiently specific in defining ``flag of the United \n     States'' to avoid the vice of vagueness. The phrase is \n     defined to include any flag in any size and in a form \n     commonly displayed as a flag that would be perceived by a \n     reasonable observer to be a flag of the United States. The \n     definition is intended to prevent circumvention by \n     destruction or damage to virtual flag representations that \n     could be as provocative to an audience as mutilating the \n     genuine article. Any potential chilling effect on free speech \n     caused by inherent definitional vagueness, moreover, is \n     nonexistent because the only type of expression punished by \n     section 3(a) is that intended \n\n[[Page S 18266]]\n     by the speaker to provoke imminent lawlessness, not a thoughtful \n     response. The First Amendment was not intended to protect \n     appeals to imminent criminality.\n       Section 3(a) also avoided content-based discrimination \n     which is generally frowned on by the First Amendment. It does \n     not punish based on a particular ideology or viewpoint of the \n     speaker. Rather, it punishes based on calculated provocations \n     of imminent violence through the destruction or damage of the \n     flag of the United States that are reasonably likely to \n     succeed irrespective of the content of the speaker's \n     expression. Such expressive neutrality is not \n     unconstitutional discrimination because the prohibition is \n     intended to safeguard the social interest in order, not to \n     suppress a particular idea. See F.C.C. v. Pacifica \n     Foundation, 438 U.S. 726, 744-746 (1978).\n       I would welcome the opportunity to amplify on the \n     constitutionality of section 3(a) as your bill progresses \n     through the legislative process.\n           Very truly yours,\n                                                       Bruce Fein,\n                                                  Attorney at Law.\n\n                              [Memorandum]\n\n     To: Interested parties.\n     From: Robert S. Peck, Esq.; Robert M. O'Neil, professor, \n         University of Virginia Law School; Erwin Chemerinsky, \n         Legion Lex Professor of Law, University of Southern \n         California.\n     Re S. 1335, the Flag Protection and Free Speech Act of 1995.\n     Date: November 7, 1995.\n       This memorandum will analyze the constitutional \n     implications of S. 1335, the Flag Protection and Free Speech \n     Act of 1995. As its name implies and the legislation states \n     as its purpose, S. 1335 seeks ``to provide the maximum \n     protection against the use of the flag of the United States \n     to promote violence while respecting the liberties that it \n     symbolizes.'' S. 1335, 104th Cong., 1st Sess. Sec. 2(b) \n     (1995). This memorandum concludes that the bill conforms to \n     constitutional requirements in both its purpose and its \n     provisions.\n       It would be a mistake to conclude that S. 1335 is \n     unconstitutional simply because the U.S. Supreme Court \n     invalidated the Flag Protection Act of 1990 in its decision \n     in United States v. Eichman, 496 U.S. 310 (1990). In this \n     decision, as well as its earlier flag-desecration opinion, \n     the Court specifically left open a number of options for \n     flag-related laws, including the approach undertaken by S. \n     1335. The Court reiterated its stand in its 1992 cross-\n     burning case, indicating that flag burning could be \n     punishable under circumstances where dishonoring the flag did \n     not comprise the gist of the crime (R.A.V. v. City of St. \n     Paul, 112 S.Ct. 2538, 2544 (1992)).\n       Unlike the 1990 flag law that the Court negated, S. 1335 is \n     not aimed at suppressing non-violent political protest; in \n     fact, it fully acknowledges that constitutionally protected \n     right. In contrast, the Flag Protection Act, the Court said, \n     unconstitutionally attempted to reserve the use of the flag \n     as a symbol for governmentally approved expressive purposes. \n     S. 1335 makes no similar attempt to prohibit the use of the \n     flag to express certain points of view. Instead, it both \n     advances a legitimate anti-violent purpose while remaining \n     solicitous of our tradition of ``uninhibited, robust, and \n     wide-open'' public debate (New York Times v. Sullivan, 376 \n     U.S. 254, 270 (1964)).\n       Moreover, the statute is sensitive to, and complies with \n     several other constitutional considerations, namely: (1) it \n     does not discriminate between expression on the basis of its \n     content or viewpoint, since it avoids the kind of \n     discrimination condemned by the Court in R.A.V.;  (2) it does \n     not provide opponents of controversial political ideas with \n     an excuse to use their own propensity for violence as a means \n     of exercising a veto over otherwise protected speech, since \n     it requires that the defendant have a specific intent to \n     instigate a violent response; and (3) it does not usurp \n     authority vested in the states, since it does not intrude \n     upon police powers traditionally exercised by the states. \n     Each of these points will be discussed in greater detail \n     below.\n       One additional point is worth noting. Passing a statute is \n     far preferable to enacting a constitutional amendment that \n     would mark the first time in its more than two centuries as a \n     beacon of freedom that the United States amended the Bill of \n     Rights. Totalitarian regimes fear freedom and enact broad \n     authorizations to pick and choose the freedoms they allow. \n     The broadly worded proposed constitutional amendment follows \n     that blueprint by giving plenary authority to the federal and \n     state governments to pick and choose which exercises of \n     freedom will be tolerated. On the contrary, American \n     democracy has never feared freedom, and no crisis exists that \n     should cause us to reconsider this path. Because the Court \n     has never said that Congress lacks the constitutional power \n     to enact a statute to prevent the flag from becoming a tool \n     of violence, a statute--rather than a constitutional \n     amendment--is an incomparably better choice.\n\n\ni. s. 1335 punishes violence or incitement to violence, not expressive \n                                conduct\n\n       The fatal common flaw in the flag-desecration prosecution \n     of Gregory Lee Johnson, whose Supreme Court case started the \n     controversy that has led to the proposed constitutional \n     amendment, and the subsequent enactment by Congress of the \n     Flag Protection Act of 1989 was the focus on punishing \n     contemptuous views concerning the American flag (Eichman, 496 \n     U.S. at 317-19; Texas v. Johnson, 491 U.S. 397, 405-07 \n     (1989)). In both instances, law was employed in an attempt to \n     reserve use of the flag for governmentally approved \n     viewpoints (i.e., patriotic purposes). The Court held such a \n     reservation violated bedrock First Amendment principles in \n     that the government has no power to ``ensure that a symbol be \n     used to express only one view of that symbol or its \n     referents.'' (Id. at 417.)\n       Johnson had been charged with desecrating a venerated \n     object, rather than any of a number of other criminal charges \n     that he could have been prosecuted for and that would not \n     have raised any constitutional issues. Critical to the \n     Supreme Court's decision in his case, as well as to the \n     Texas courts that also held the conviction \n     unconstitutional, was the fact that ``[n]o one was \n     physically injured or threatened with injury.'' 491 U.S. \n     at 399. The Texas Court of Criminal Appeals noted that \n     ``there was no breach of the peace nor does the record \n     reflect that the situation was potentially explosive.'' \n     Id. at 401 (quoting 755 S.W.2d 92, 96 (1988)). Thus, the \n     primary concern addressed by S. 1335, incitement to \n     violence, was not at issue in the Johnson case. The \n     Eichman Court found the congressional statute to be \n     indistinguishable in its intent and purpose from the \n     prosecution reviewed in Johnson and thus also \n     unconstitutional.\n       In reaching its conclusion about the issue of \n     constitutionality, the Court, however, specifically declared \n     that ``[W]e do not suggest that the First Amendment forbids a \n     State to prevent `imminent lawless action.' '' Id. at 410 \n     (quoting Brandenburg v. Ohio, 395 U.S. 444, 447 (1969)). In \n     Brandenburg, the Court said that government may not ``forbid \n     or proscribe advocacy of the use of force or of law violation \n     except where such advocacy is directed to inciting or \n     producing imminent lawless action and is likely to incite or \n     produce such action.'' 395 U.S. at 447. It went on to state \n     that ``[a] statute which fails to draw this distinction \n     impermissibly intrudes upon the freedoms guaranteed by the \n     First and Fourteenth Amendments. It sweeps within its \n     condemnation speech which our Constitution has immunized from \n     government control.'' Id. at 448.\n       S. 1335 merely takes up the Court's invitation to focus a \n     proper law on ``imminent lawless action.'' It specifically \n     punishes ``[a]ny person who destroys or damages a flag of the \n     United States with the primary purpose and intent to incite \n     or produce imminent violence or a breach of the peace, and in \n     circumstances where the person knows it is reasonably likely \n     to produce imminent violence or a breach of the peace.'' S. \n     1335, at Sec. 3(a). The language precisely mirrors the \n     Court's Brandenburg criteria. It does not implicate the \n     Constitution's free-speech protections, because ``[t]he First \n     Amendment does not protect violence.'' NAACP v. Claiborne \n     Hardware Co., 458 U.S. 886, 916 (1982).\n       More recently, the Court put it this way: ``a physical \n     assault is not by any stretch of the imagination expressive \n     conduct protected by the First Amendment.'' Wisconsin v. \n     Mitchell, 113 S.Ct. 2194, 2199 (1993). Under the Court's \n     criteria, for example, a symbolic protest that consists of \n     hanging the President in effigy is indeed protected symbolic \n     speech. Although hanging the actual President might convey \n     the same message of protest, a physical assault on the \n     nation's chief executive cannot be justified as \n     constitutionally protected expressive activity and could \n     constitutionally be singled out for specific punishment. S. \n     1335 makes this necessary distinction as well, protecting \n     the use of the flag to make a political statement, whether \n     pro- or anti-government, while imposing sanctions for its \n     use to incite a violent response.\n       Courts and prosecutors are quite capable of discerning the \n     difference between protected speech and actionable conduct. \n     Federal law already makes a variety of threats of violence a \n     crime. Congress has, for example, targeted for criminal \n     sanction interference with commerce by threats or violence, \n     18 U.S.C. Sec. 1951, (1994), incitement to riot, 18 U.S.C. \n     Sec. 2101, tampering with consumer products, 18 U.S.C. \n     Sec. 1365, and interfering with certain federally protected \n     activities. 18 U.S.C. Sec. 245. S. 1335 fits well within the \n     rubric that these laws have previously occupied. It cannot be \n     reasonably asserted that S. 1335 attempts to suppress \n     protected expression.\n\n\n II. S. 1335 Does Not Unconstitutionally Discriminate on the Basis of \n                          Content or Viewpoint\n\n       The Supreme Court has repeatedly recognized that ``above \n     all else, the First Amendment means that government has no \n     power to restrict expression because of its message, its \n     ideas, its subject matter, or its content.'' Police \n     Department v. Mosley, 408 U.S. 92, 95 (1972). On this basis, \n     the Court recently invalidated a St. Paul, Minnesota \n     ordinance that purported to punish symbolic expression when \n     it constituted fighting words directed toward people because \n     of their race, color, creed, religion or gender. Fighting \n     words is a category of expression that the Court had \n     previously held to be outside the First Amendment's \n     protections. Chaplinsky v. New Hampshire, 315 U.S. 568, 571-\n     72 (1942). In R.A.V. v. City of St. Paul, 112 S.Ct. 2538, \n     2543 (1992), the Court gave this statement greater nuance by \n     stating that categories of speech such as fighting words are \n     not so entirely without constitutional import ``that they may \n     be made the vehicles for content discrimination unrelated to \n     their distinctively proscribable content.'' Explaining this \n\n[[Page S 18267]]\n     concept, the Court gave an example involving libel: ``the government \n     may proscribe libel; but it may not make the further content \n     discrimination of proscribing only libel critical of the \n     government.'' Id.\n       As a further example, the Court said a city council could \n     not enact an ordinance prohibiting only those legally obscene \n     works that contain criticism of the city government. Id. As \n     yet another example, the Court stated that ``burning a flag \n     in violation of an ordinance against outdoor fires could be \n     punishable, whereas burning a flag in violation of an \n     ordinance against dishonoring the flag is not.'' Id. at 2544. \n     The rationale behind this limitation, the Court explained, \n     was that government could not be vested with the power to \n     ``drive certain ideas or viewpoints from the marketplace.'' \n     Id. at 2545 (quoting Simon & Schuster, Inc. v. Members of \n     the N.Y. State Crime Victims Bd., 112 S.Ct. 501, 508 \n     (1991)).\n       No such danger exists under S. 1335. Both the patriotic \n     group that makes use of the flag to provoke a violent \n     response from dissenters and the protesters who use the flag \n     to provoke a violent response from loyalists are subject to \n     its provisions. A law that would only punish one or the other \n     perspective would have the kind of constitutional flaw \n     identified by the Court in R.A.V. Moreover, the legislation \n     recognizes, as the Supreme Court itself did (``the flag \n     occupies a ``deservedly cherished place in our community,'' \n     491 U.S. at 419) that the flag has a special status that \n     justifies its special attention. Similarly, the R.A.V. Court \n     noted that a law aimed at protecting the President against \n     threats of violence, even though it did not protect other \n     citizens, is constitutional because such threats ``have \n     special force when applied to the person of the President.'' \n     Id. at 2546. The rule against content discrimination, the \n     Court explained, is not a rule against underinclusiveness. \n     For example, ``a State may choose to regulate price \n     advertising in one industry but not in others, because the \n     risk of fraud is in its view greater there.'' Id. \n     (parenthetical and citation omitted).\n       The federal laws cited earlier that make certain types of \n     threats of violence into crimes are not thought to pose \n     content discrimination problems because they deal with only \n     limited kinds of threats. To give another example, federal \n     law also makes the use of a gun in the course of a crime \n     grounds for special additional punishment. See 18 U.S.C. \n     Sec. 924(c). In Brandenburg, the Court found that a Ku Klux \n     Klan rally at which guns were brandished and overthrow of the \n     government discussed remained protected free speech. Because \n     guns were used for expressive purposes in Brandenburg and \n     found to be beyond the law's reach there does not mean that \n     the law enhancing punishment because a gun is used during the \n     commission of a crime unlawfully infringes on any expressive \n     rights.\n       The gun law makes the necessary constitutional distinctions \n     that the Court requires, and so does S. 1335's concentration \n     on crimes involving the American flag rather than protests \n     involving the flag. S. 1335 properly identifies in its \n     findings the reason for Congress to take special note of the \n     flag: ``it is a unique symbol of national unity.'' \n     Sec. 2(a)(1). It notes that ``destruction of the flag of the \n     United States can occur to incite a violent response rather \n     than make a political statement.'' Sec. 2(a)(4). As a result, \n     Congress has developed the necessary legislative facts to \n     justify such a particularized law.\n       In its only post-R.A.V. decision on a hate-crimes statute, \n     the Court upheld a statute that enhanced the punishment of an \n     individual who ``intentionally selects'' his victim on the \n     basis of race, religion, color, disability, sexual \n     orientation, national origin or ancestry. Wisconsin v. \n     Mitchell, 113 S. Ct. 2194 (1993). A fair reading of the \n     Court's unanimous decision in that case supports the \n     conclusion that the Court would not strike down S. 1335 on \n     R.A.V. grounds. In Mitchell, the Court concluded that the \n     statute did not impermissibly punish the defendant's \n     ``abstract beliefs,'' id. at 2200 (citing Dawson v. \n     Delaware, 112 S. Ct. 1093 (1992)), but instead spotlighted \n     conduct that had the potential to cause a physical harm \n     that the State could properly proscribe. S. 1335 similarly \n     eschews ideological or viewpoint discrimination to focus \n     on the intentional provocation of violence, a harm well \n     within the government's power to punish.\n\n\n            III. S. 1335 does not encourage a heckler's veto\n\n       First Amendment doctrine does not permit the government to \n     use the excuse of a hostile audience to prevent the \n     expression of political ideas. Thus, the First Amendment will \n     not allow the government to give a heckler some sort of veto \n     against the expression of ideas that he or she finds \n     offensive. As a result, the Court has observed, ``in public \n     debate our own citizens must tolerate insulting, and even \n     outrageous, speech in order to provide `adequate breathing \n     space' to the freedoms protected by the First Amendment.'' \n     Boos v. Barry, 485 U.S. 312, 322 (1988). Any other approach \n     to free speech ``would lead to standardization of ideas \n     either by legislation, courts, or dominant political or \n     community groups.'' Terminiello v. Chicago, 337 U.S. 1, 4 \n     (1949). Thus, simply because some might be provoked and \n     respond violently to a march that expresses hatred of the \n     residents of a community, that is insufficient justification \n     to overcome the First Amendment's protection of ideas, no \n     matter how noxious they may be deemed. See, e.g., Collin v. \n     Smith, 578 F.2d 1197 (7th Cir.), Cert. denied, 436 U.S. 953 \n     (1978).\n       The Supreme Court's flag-burning decisions applied this \n     principle. In Johnson, the state of Texas attempted to \n     counter the argument against its flag-desecration prosecution \n     by asserting an overriding governmental interest; it claimed \n     that the burning of a flag ``is necessarily likely to disturb \n     the peace and that the expression may be prohibited on this \n     basis.'' 491 U.S. at 408 (footnote omitted). The Court \n     rejected this argument on two grounds: (1) no evidence had \n     been submitted to indicate that there was an actual breach of \n     the peace, nor was evidence adduced that a breach of the \n     peace was one of Johnson's goals; Id. at 407, and (2) to hold \n     ``that every flag burning necessarily possesses [violent] \n     potential would be to eviscerate our holding in Brandenburg \n     [that the expression must be directed to and likely to incite \n     or produce violence to be subject to criminalization].'' Id. \n     at 409.\n       S. 1335 avoids the problems that Texas had by requiring \n     that the defendant have ``the primary purpose and intent to \n     incite or produce imminent violence or a breach of the peace, \n     . . . in circumstances where the person knows it is \n     reasonably likely to produce imminent violence or a breach of \n     the peace.'' S. 1335, at Sec. (a)(a). If Texas had \n     demonstrated that Johnson had intended to breach the peace \n     and was likely to accomplish this goal, Johnson could have \n     been convicted of a crime for burning the U.S. flag. Texas, \n     however, never attempted to prove this.\n       Moreover, S. 1335 does not enable hecklers to veto \n     expression by reacting violently because it requires that the \n     defendant have the specific intent to provoke that response, \n     while at the same time taking away any bias-motivated \n     discretion from law enforcers. The existence of a scienter \n     requirement and a likelihood element is critical to \n     distinguishing between a law that unconstitutionally punishes \n     a viewpoint because some people hate it and one that \n     legitimately punishes incitement to violence.\n\n\n          iv. s. 1335 is consistent with federalism principles\n\n       Earlier this year, the Supreme Court held that the Gun-Free \n     School Zones Act of 1990, 18 U.S.C. Sec. 922(q)(1)(a) \n     unconstitutionally exceeded the power of Congress to regulate \n     commerce. United States v. Lopez, 63 U.S.L.W. 4343 (1995). In \n     doing so, the Court reaffirmed the original principle that \n     ``the powers delegated by the [] Constitution to the federal \n     government are few and defined. Those which are to remain in \n     the State governments are numerous and indefinite.'' Id. at \n     4344 (quoting The Federalist No. 45, pp. 292-293 (C. Rossiter \n     ed. 1961) (James Madison)).\n       S. 1335 respects these principles by directing its \n     sanctions only at preventing the use of the national flag to \n     incite violence, preventing someone from damaging an American \n     flag belonging to the United States, or damaging, on federal \n     land, an American flag stolen from another person. Each of \n     these acts have a clear federal nexus and remain properly \n     within the jurisdiction of the federal government. Moreover, \n     the bill concedes jurisdiction to the states wherever it may \n     properly be exercised. S. 1335, at Sec. 3(a)(d).\n\n\n                             v. conclusion\n\n       S. 1335 is carefully crafted to avoid constitutional \n     difficulties by being solicitous of federalism and freedom of \n     speech by focusing on incitement to violence. By doing so, it \n     meets all constitutional requirements.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                   Congressional Research Service,\n\n\n                                      The Library of Congress,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, October 23, 1995.\n     To: Hon. Robert F. Bennett (Attention: Lisa Norton).\n     From: American Law Division.\n     Subject: Constitutionality of flag desecration bill.\n       This memorandum is in response to your request for a \n     constitutional evaluation of S. 1335, 104th Congress, a bill \n     to provide for the protection of the flag of the United \n     States and free speech and for other purposes.\n       Briefly, the bill would criminalize the destruction or \n     damage of a United States flag under three circumstances. \n     First, subsection (a) would penalize such conduct when the \n     person engaging in it does so with the primary purpose and \n     intent to incite or produce imminent violence or a breach of \n     the peace and in circumstances where the person knows it is \n     reasonably likely to produce imminent violence or a breach of \n     the peace.\n       Second, subsection (b) would punish any person who steals \n     or knowingly converts to his or her use, or to the use of \n     another, a United States flag belonging to the United States \n     and who intentionally destroys or damages that flag. Third, \n     subsection (c) punishes any person who, within any lands \n     reserved for the use of the United States or under the \n     exclusive or concurrent jurisdiction of the United States, \n     steals or knowingly converts to his or her use, or to the use \n     of another, a flag of the United States belonging to another \n     person and who intentionally destroys or damages that flag.\n       Of course, the bill is intended to protect the flag of the \n     United States in circumstances under which statutory \n     protection may be afforded. The obstacle to a general \n     prohibition of destruction of or damage to the flag is the \n     principle enunciated in United States v. Eichman, 496 U.S. \n     310 (1990), and Texas v. Johnson, 491 U.S. 397 (1989), that \n     flag desecration, usually through burning, is expressive \n     conduct if committed to ``send a message,'' and that the \n     Court would review \n\n[[Page S 18268]]\n     limits on this conduct with exacting scrutiny; legislation that \n     proposed to penalize the conduct in order to silence the \n     message or out of disagreement with the message violates the \n     First Amendment speech clause.\n       Rather clearly, subsections (b) and (c) would present no \n     constitutional difficulties, based on judicial precedents, \n     either facially or as applied. The Court has been plain that \n     one may not exercise expressive conduct or symbolic speech \n     with or upon the property of others or by trespass upon the \n     property of another. Eichman, supra, 496 U.S., 316 n., 5; \n     Johnson, supra, 412 n. 8; Spence v. Washington, 418 U.S. 405, \n     408-409 (1974). See also, R.A. v. City of St. Paul, 112 S.Ct. \n     2538 (1992) (cross burning on another's property). The \n     subsections are directed precisely to the theft or conversion \n     of a flag belonging to someone else, the government or a \n     private party, and the destruction of or damage to that flag.\n       Almost as evident from the Supreme Court's precedents, \n     subsection (a) is quite likely to pass constitutional muster. \n     The provision's language is drawn from the ``fighting words'' \n     doctrine of Chaplinsky v. New Hampshire, 315 U.S. 568 (1942). \n     That case defined a variety of expression that was \n     unprotected by the First Amendment, among the categories \n     being speech that inflicts injury or tends to incite \n     immediate violence. Id., 572. While the Court over the years \n     has modified the other categories listed in Chaplinsky, it \n     has not departed from the holding that the ``fighting words'' \n     exception continues to exist. It has, of course, laid down \n     some governing principles, which are reflected in the \n     subsection's language.\n       Thus, the Court has applied to ``fighting words'' the \n     principle of Brandenburg v. Ohio, 395 U.S. 444 (1969), under \n     which speech advocating unlawful action may be punished only \n     if it directed to inciting or producing imminent lawless \n     action and is likely to incite or produce such action. Id., \n     447. This development is spelled out in Cohen v. California, \n     403 U.S. 15, 20, 22-23 (1971). See also NAACP v. Claiborne \n     Hardware Co., 458 U.S. 886, 928 (1982); Hess v. Indiana, 414 \n     U.S. 105 (1973).\n       A second principle, enunciated in an opinion demonstrating \n     the continuing vitality of the ``fighting words'' doctrine, \n     is that it is impermissible to punish only those ``fighting \n     words'' of which government disapproves. Government may not \n     distinguish between classes of ``fighting words'' on an \n     ideological basis. R.A.V. v. City of St. Paul, 112 S.Ct. 2538 \n     (1992).\n       Subsection (a) is drafted in a manner to reflect both these \n     principles. It requires not only that the conduct be \n     reasonably likely to produce imminent violence or breach of \n     the peace, but that the person intend to bring about imminent \n     violence or breach of the peace. Further, nothing in the \n     subsection draws a distinction between approved or \n     disapproved expression that is communicated by the action \n     committed with or on the flag.\n       In conclusion, the judicial precedents establish that the \n     bill, if enacted, would survive constitutional attack. \n     Subsections (b) and (c) are more securely grounded in \n     constitutional law, but subsection (a) is only a little less \n     anchored in decisional law.\n       Because of time constraints, this memorandum is necessarily \n     brief. If, however, you desire a more generous treatment, \n     please do not hesitate to get in touch with us.\n\n                                            Johnny H. Killian,\n\n                                                Senior Specialist,\n                                      American Constitutional Law.\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I know my colleagues and their allies who support the \nconstitutional amendment are motivated by the highest ideals and \nprinciples.\n  I share their reverence for the flag and the values and history it \nrepresents. But even a constitutional amendment won't succeed in \ncoercing proper respect for the flag. It will, however, do damage to \nthe Constitution and the cause of freedom.\n  After all, is that not what the flag signifies--freedom? That is what \nit signifies.\n  Who can forget the pictures of the fall of the Berlin Wall, as nation \nafter nation of Eastern Europe threw off the shackles of communism for \nfreedom? The American flags flying over our embassies in the countries \nbehind the Iron Curtain held the hopes and dreams of those subjugated \nunder communism.\n  Spreading freedom is uniquely our American creed. In our history, we \nhave seen freedom triumph over our colonial forbearers, over the slave \nholders, over the Fascists and over the dictators.\n  To narrow the Bill of Rights, even in the name of the flag and \npatriotism, constricts freedom and would reverse the 200-year American \nexperiment with freedom that has made our Nation the envy of the world.\n  Let us not give flag-burners--the miscreants who hate America and the \nfreedom we cherish--more attention than they deserve. Do not let these \nfew scoundrels with nothing better to do than burn our flag chase \nfreedom from the shores of America.\n  I urge adoption of my statutory alternative to punish those who \ndesecrate the flag, rather than a constitutional amendment that strikes \nat the heart of our most cherished freedoms.\n  So, Mr. President, in all likelihood, we will be voting on this \namendment sometime either Monday or Tuesday, depending on whether a \nunanimous-consent agreement is entered into. I hope that the amendment \nwill be given serious consideration by the Senate as an alternative \napproach which clearly would meet constitutional standards to amending \nthe Constitution.\n  Mr. President, on another matter, I ask unanimous consent to proceed \nas in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Inhofe). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/12/08/senate-section/article/S18264-1", "month": "12", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "08", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S18268-S18272]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 BURMA\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, last week, in yet another remarkable \nact of courage, Daw Aung San Suu Kyi announced her party, the National \nLeague for Democracy, will not participate in the constitutional \nconvention called by the State Law and Order Restoration Council, \nSLORC.\n  As many who have followed Burma in recent years know, remaining true \nto the people who elected her and the NLD in 1990, Suu Kyi declared,\n\n       A country which is drawing up a constitution that will \n     decide the future of the state should have the confidence of \n     the people.\n\na standard SLORC clearly does not and cannot meet.\n  In fact, SLORC has already stacked the constitutional deck against \nthe NLD and Suu Kyi. Convention participants have been forced to accept \nguidelines that will preserve a leading role for the military in \nBurma's political life and would exclude anyone married to a foreigner \nfrom assuming the office of president. As we all know, this would \nprevent Suu Kyi from assuming the position she was elected in 1990 to \nfulfill since she is married to a British scholar.\n  Mr. President, at the end of my comments, I will insert two articles \nwhich appeared on November 30 in the Washington Post and the New York \nTimes regarding the current situation in Burma--there is no question \nthat the decision to boycott has increased the level of tension in \nRangoon. SLORC has now charged Suu Kyi and her supporters as engaging \nin confrontational politics, but, as Suu Kyi is quick to point out:\n\n       What they have termed confrontational is that we have asked \n     for dialogue, which we want in order to prevent \n     confrontation. To silence the views of people whose opinions \n     are different by putting them in prison is far more \n     confrontational.\n\n  Let me assure my colleagues that Suu Kyi's understanding of the \ndeteriorating situation in Burma is not a lonely minority view. Last \nweek the United Nations, once again, took up the question of Burma's \npolitical and human rights record. Once again, the Special Rapporteur, \nDr. Yokota, issued a report which few may actually read, but it is a \npowerful voice for the thousands and thousands of Burmese citizens who \ncontinue to suffer at the hands of SLORC.\n\n  Let me briefly tick off the observations made in the report.\n  In describing the constitutional convention, Dr. Yokota noted that in \nspite of his efforts to meet privately with political leaders who still \nplanned to participate in the process, SLORC would only permit visits \nsupervised by SLORC officials. He stated in unequivocal terms, the \nNational Convention ``is not heading toward restoration of democracy.''\n  While the Special Rapporteur welcomed the release of Suu Kyi and \nthree other senior officials, he criticized the continued imprisonment \nof several hundred political prisoners and the complex array of \nsecurity laws allowing SLORC sweeping powers of arbitrary arrest and \ndetention--authority that they continue to use--I might argue abuse--\nweekly.\n  Yokota also condemned the severity of court sentences without regard \nto fair trials, access to defense lawyers or any consideration of \nproportionality between offense and punishment. After sentencing, he \ndrew attention to the fact that conditions in prisons are impossible to \nmonitor because SLORC continues to stonewall the International Red \nCross Committee and its request for access to detention sites.\n  In his March 1995 report, Dr. Yokota confirmed that military \nofficials have carried out arbitrary killings, rape, \n\n[[Page S 18269]]\ntorture, forced portage, forced labor, forced relocation, and \nconfiscation of private property--each and every act a violation of \ninternational law. In this month's report he indicates that the pattern \ncontinues and as before, takes place most frequently in border areas \nwhere the Army is engaged in military operations or where regional \ndevelopment projects are taking place. He added:\n\n       Many of the victims of such atrocious acts belong to ethnic \n     national populations, especially women, peasants, daily wage \n     earners and other peaceful civilians who do not have enough \n     money to avoid mistreatment by bribing officials.\n\n  Dr. Yokota paints a grim portrait of Burma today--a picture which \nstands at odds with the one the international business community would \nhave us see.\n  A few months ago, in my office, I listened as the chairman of a large \nAmerican oil company eager to do business with SLORC denounced as \nrumors and gossip the idea that the SLORC was engaged in any forced \nrelocations related to his project. I respectfully suggest this month's \nU.N. report rises above the gossip standard.\n  Mr. President, I share the concerns raised by the U.N. Rapporteur. \nLet me stress to my colleagues that he is not reporting on a situation \nthat has changed for the better since Suu Kyi's release, but one which \nis growing progressively worse.\n  Mr. President, I have taken the time to come to the floor to discuss \nthese events because I am deeply disturbed by twin developments--a \nmajor campaign by American companies to enhance the political \nlegitimacy of SLORC even as SLORC attempts to crush the fledgling \ndemocracy movement inside Burma.\n  In recent weeks, many United States businesses have engaged in an \naggressive campaign to persuade the public that SLORC is worth doing \nbusiness with because like Vietnam and China, Burma can be improved \nthrough economic engagement.\n  I think it is important to draw a key distinction. Unlike China and \nVietnam, Burma held legitimate elections and chose a leader, Aung San \nSuu Kyi. The elections by all accounts were free, fair, and 7 million \npeople made their views absolutely clear.\n  I must confess, I was appalled by a recent study produced by the \nNational Bureau for Asian Research which suggested these results were \nessentially irrelevant. The report said, Suu Kyi was:\n\n       Obviously sincere, but it remains to be seen how successful \n     she will be in her attempts and whether her supporters are \n     helping her attain a position of leadership.\n\n  Insult was added to injury when the report stated:\n\n       Even assuming the time may come when she does have a say in \n     how the country is governed, it is an open question of how \n     well equipped she is for such responsibilities, and to what \n     extent she would be able to rely on experienced technocrats \n     and administrators.\n\n  These assertions are outrageously offensive. To imply she is \nincapable of leading her nation offends every citizen who voted for her \nand more importantly stands in stark contrast to her record. Suu Kyi \nhas conducted herself with dignity and courage uncommon in this \ncentury.\n\n  The Burmese people voted--they, like Suu Kyi, have earned our respect \nand support. The fact that the results were rejected by a handful of \nruthless, self serving generals does not undermine the validity of the \nelections or the outcome.\n  When recently pressed by a representative of the U.N. Secretary \nGeneral to engage in a dialog with Suu Kyi, SLORC officials dismissed \nthe request point out, Suu Kyi was now:\n\n       An ordinary citizen, that in 1990 there were as many as 230 \n     political parties with which it would be impossible to \n     establish dialogue and it would thus not be even handed to \n     single out any one of them.\n\n  Well, she is the one they elected.\n  Two hundred and thirty political parties did not carry the \nelections--the National League for Democracy and Suu Kyi did. She has \nearned the right to negotiate a timetable for the restoration of \ndemocracy for her people. It is her right and our obligation as the \nbeacon of democracy to support that effort.\n  To make the argument that the United States should resign itself to \ndealing with SLORC to bring about change, compromises the very core of \nbeliefs that define our history and guide this Nation.\n  We do not yield to vicious dictators--we do not abandon those who \nstrain against the barbed wire shackles of repression.\n  It absolutely sickens me that any respectable academic organization--\nfor that matter any American company--would suggest that economic \nopportunity and political expediency should impel the United States to \naccept SLORC as the representatives of the Burmese people.\n  It is not just the campaign that is being waged here at home to \nenhance SLORC's political credentials that has brought me to the floor \nof the Senate. I am also concerned about recent events in Burma.\n  Not only has SLORC repeatedly and publicly rejected Suu Kyi's call \nfor a dialog on national reconciliation, last week a senior official \nthreatened to annihilate anyone who attempted to endanger the \nmilitary's rule. This week, the noose tightened a little more and Suu \nKyi was directly threatened. The official military newspaper called Suu \nKyi a traitor who should be annihilated.\n  Rhetoric has been matched by an increased willingness to restrict Suu \nKyi's role. In October, the National Democracy League voted to \nreinstate Suu Kyi as General Secretary along with a slate of other \nofficials. In yet another effort to work peacefully with SLORC, the NLD \nsubmitted the leadership list to the junta for approval.\n  SLORC rejected the results as illegal and refused to recognize Suu \nKyi's position. Is it any wonder her party has decided they cannot \nparticipate in the constitutional convention process?\n  Last week--like every week since her release--thousands of people \ngathered outside Suu Kyi's home to listen to her speak. Each Saturday \nand Sunday spontaneous crowds have made the pilgrimage to her compound \nand left inspired by her courage, her confidence, and her commitment to \ntheir freedom and future. It is a crowd described in the U.N. report \nand in news accounts as large and peaceful with a sense of purpose and \ndiscipline.\n  Unfortunately, 2 weeks ago, there was a sharp change in the SLORC's \ntolerance for these gatherings. In an apparent attempt to restrict \naccess to Suu Kyi, police began to erect barricades around her home. I \nunderstand three young student supporters were arrested when they tried \nto intervene. According to Dr. Yokota's report, corroborated by \nnewspaper stories, the three were charged and sentenced 2 days later to \n2 years imprisonment.\n  These arrests were followed by another ominous development. When the \nNLD announced it would not participate in the constitutional \nconvention, the party's senior officials woke up to find their homes \nsurrounded by armed soldiers.\n  Democracy activists are not suffering in Burma alone. Last week nine \nmembers of the New Era newspaper staff were detained in Thailand. The \nNew Era is an underground newspaper with wide circulation inside \nBurma--apparently being caught with a copy results in immediate arrest. \nBowing to pressure from SLORC, in anticipation of an upcoming visit by \na senior junta official, Khin Nyunt, Thai officials apparently have \ndetained the New Era journalists--including a 71-year-old editor and \nhis 65-year-old wife.\n  Reports from activists inside and outside Burma suggest a broad crack \ndown on democratic activists is imminent. I hope this is not true and \nurge the administration to make clear United States opposition to any \nsuch actions. However, the evidence suggests there is credible reason \nto be concerned.\n  It is clear that the fledgling democracy movement in Burma is under \nsiege. I find the words of Suu Kyi's fellow democrat, NLD Vice Chairman \nU Tin O, chilling. On Wednesday night, after the boycott announcement, \nsix soldiers surrounded his home and another soldier now follows him \neverywhere.\n  A political prisoner for years, the 68-year-old vice chairman said \nwith a wan smile, ``We have no worries at all. I have been in prison \nbefore. They can detain me, do whatever they want. This is not a \ndemocratic country. We have to face some costs for the legitimate \nrights of a democracy.''\n  It is my hope he, Suu Kyi and the NLD will not bear the costs alone \nor for long.\n\n[[Page S 18270]]\n\n  Mr. President, in the near future the United Nations will take up a \nresolution regarding Burma. I have been advised that the United Nations \nwill, once again, condemn the human rights and political situation in \nclear and compelling terms. I commend Ambassador Albright for her \nefforts to assure our support for Suu Kyi and democracy in Burma are \nspelled out in the resolution.\n  However, for more than a year the administration has argued Burma and \nSLORC has a choice--they must immediately improve their human rights \nrecord and move promptly to open the political process or they will \nface further international isolation. I agree, but my definition of \nprompt and immediate seems to differ with theirs.\n  I think we have given SLORC ample time to make a decision. Given \nrecent events, it is clear they have no intention to relax their \nruthless grip on power.\n  So in conjunction with the U.N. resolution it is my intention to \nintroduce bipartisan sanctions legislation. I encourage my colleagues \nto support this effort as I see no other way to support Suu Kyi and the \nrestoration of democracy in Burma.\n  There is no question that sanctions and further isolation of SLORC is \nan initiative she supports. Indeed, once again this week Suu Kyi \ndenounced the increase in foreign investment and urged companies to \nwait until democracy has been restored before bringing business to \nBurma.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the article, which \nincluded her remarks, be printed in the Record and that the Yokota \nreport and Amnesty International report on the current situation be \nprinted along with that.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the New York Times, Nov. 30, 1995]\n\n            Burmese Opposition To Boycott Junta's Convention\n\n                           (By Philip Shenon)\n\n       Rangoon, Burma.--Defying the military government, Aung San \n     Suu Kyi, the Burmese opposition leader, announced Wednesday \n     that her political party would boycott a military-run \n     convention to draw up a new constitution for Burma.\n       The move was Mrs. Suu Kyi's most direct challenge to the \n     junta since she was freed in July after spending nearly six \n     years under house arrest.\n       ``The people of Burma are very united in thinking that the \n     national convention is not heading toward democracy,'' the \n     Nobel Peace Prize winner said in announcing the boycott. ``I \n     do not think there is as yet any evidence that the people of \n     Burma support this national convention.''\n       In a letter delivered Tuesday, the party informed the \n     government of its decision to boycott the convention, which \n     reopened this week after a seven-month recess, in protest \n     over the junta's refusal to open negotiations with the party \n     over Burma's political future.\n       In a response published Wednesday in a government-run \n     newspaper, the junta accused the leaders of the party, the \n     National League for Democracy, of trying to disrupt the \n     national convention in hopes of replacing it ``with a \n     convention they would be able to dominate as they like.''\n       The party's decision to boycott the constitutional \n     convention was ``totally forsaking and going against the \n     national interests,'' the military statement warned.\n       The government also deployed uniformed soldiers to the \n     homes of three senior party members. The soldiers allowed \n     residents of the houses to come and go, but foreign diplomats \n     reported widespread rumors that a wing of Insein Prison, the \n     local penitentiary used to hold political prisoners, had been \n     cleared out in recent days to make space for many of Mrs. Suu \n     Kyi's followers.\n       The boycott by Mrs. Suu Kyi and her party removes any \n     veneer of legitimacy from the convention, which was organized \n     by the military two years ago to enshrine its political role \n     in the Burmese government.\n       The junta, which calls itself the State Law and Order \n     Restoration Council, has refused to honor the results of \n     elections in 1990 won overwhelmingly by the National League \n     for Democracy. Mrs. Suu Kyi, the Oxford-educated daughter of \n     Burma's independence hero, Gen. Aung San, was under house \n     arrest at the time of the voting.\n       Since her release in July, Mrs. Suu Kyi has called \n     repeatedly for negotiations with the junta, saying she is \n     anxious to avoid any possibility of a repetition of the \n     violence that occurred in 1988, when thousands of her \n     supporters were gunned down in a military crackdown that led \n     to her house arrest the next year.\n       ``We do not want to call the people onto the streets, and \n     we have no intention of calling the people into the \n     streets,'' she said at a news conference Wednesday in her \n     lakeside garden. ``We have always said that we are prepared \n     to have dialogue at any time.''\n       But the generals have not responded to her pleas, pushing \n     ahead instead with a stage-managed constitutional convention \n     in which delegates, mostly handpicked by the military, are \n     drafting a constitution that guarantees the military a \n     permanent role in Burmese politics.\n       As a result of her boycott, the 86 seats allotted to the \n     National League for Democracy were empty in the convention \n     hall Wednesday, the second day of the current session.\n       ``The authorities did not at any time show any willingness \n     to talk to the National League for Democracy as the winning \n     party of the 1990 elections,'' Mrs. Suu Kyi said. ``They keep \n     saying that the national convention is a substitute for \n     dialogue. I do no think they can say that any longer.''\n       Plainclothes soldiers have been stationed outside Mrs. Suu \n     Kyi's house since her release--and at her request, which is \n     seen by diplomats as a clever move since it allows Mrs. Suu \n     Kyi to blame the military if a public disturbance outside her \n     home should get out of hand.\n       But there was no request by the party for the uniformed \n     soldiers who suddenly appeared outside the homes of three of \n     her senior party colleagues on Tuesday night, hours after the \n     National League for Democracy informed the government of its \n     boycott.\n       Western diplomats said they feared that the junta might try \n     to arrest some of the party's senior members on charges of \n     inciting public disorder because of the boycott.\n       The party's vice chairman and one of its founders, U Tin \n     Oo, said in an interview that six uniformed soldiers had \n     appeared outside his home Tuesday night, and that he had been \n     tailed by another soldier as he traveled through the city \n     Wednesday.\n       ``But we have no worries at all,'' he insisted with a \n     confident smile. ``I have been in prison before. They can \n     detain me, do whatever they want. This is not a democratic \n     country. We have to face some costs for the restoration of \n     the legitimate rights of a democracy.''\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n               [From the Washington Post, Nov. 30, 1995]\n\n       Burmese Opposition Leader Snubs Junta's Constitution Talks\n\n                             (By Doug Fine)\n\n       Rangoon, Burma.--Using the backdrop of a government-\n     sponsored constitutional convention as a forum for stepping \n     up opposition to the country's military rules, Nobel Prize-\n     winning opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi said today that \n     Burma is not headed on the path of democracy.\n       Four and half months after her release from house arrest by \n     the ruling State Law and Order Restoration Council, Aung San \n     Suu Kyi addresses increasingly large crowds each weekend \n     afternoon from the gate of her home near Rangoon University.\n       But in a news conference and talk today at her fenced-in \n     compound, she revealed that her National League for \n     Democracy, which overwhelmingly won elections in 1990 that \n     the military refused to recognize, has notified government \n     officials that the party would not participate in the \n     constitutional deliberations. The military government hopes \n     the convention will legitimize its rule by forging an \n     ``enduring state constitution.''\n       Insisting that the military first open a dialogue with her \n     party, which it has refused to do, Aung San Suu Kyi said, ``A \n     country which is drawing up a constitution that will decide \n     the future of a state should have the confidence of the \n     people.\n       Her party's boycott has resulted in a palpable increase in \n     tension in Rangoon. Party leaders discovered security forces \n     stationed outside their homes when they awoke today, a day \n     after the convention opened.\n       Despite the tense atmosphere and the chaotic presence at \n     her house of dozens of convention delegates barred from \n     attending the convention, Aung San Suu Kyi took time to \n     outline her views on democracy, the goal of her political \n     movement, which has taken on new life since her release.\n       ``With 7 million votes for the party in 1990,'' she said, \n     ``the views of the people are very clear. They want a \n     constitution that will defend their basic rights.''\n       Despite considerable corruption and a thriving black \n     market, Aung San Suu Kyi insisted that Burma is adequately \n     prepared for democracy and maintained that its absence is \n     responsible for the corruption.\n       ``This country was a democracy once from independence in \n     1948 until a 1962 military coup, and our situation then was \n     very much better than it is now,'' she said. ``The Burmese \n     people are disciplined and receptive if you explain what is \n     wanted of them and why.''\n       Aung San Suu Kyi was placed under house arrest in 1989, a \n     year after the military instituted a crackdown on her \n     supporters that resulted in thousands of deaths. Many of her \n     associates are still in prison. She won the Nobel Peace Prize \n     in 1991 for her democracy campaign. Since her release from \n     confinement in July, she has repeatedly called for \n     reconciliation and dialogue among democratic forces, ethnic \n     groups and her military foes.\n       Reponding to the military's charges that her party's \n     methods are confrontational, Aung San Suu Kyi reacted \n     angrily. ``What they have termed `confrontational' is that we \n     have asked for a dialogue, which we want in order to prevent \n     confrontation. To silence the views of people whose opinions \n     are different by putting them in prison is far more \n     confrontational.\n       Yet the move to boycott the constitutional convention is \n     likely to be viewed as a provocation by the regime, which \n     observers said \n\n[[Page S 18271]]\n     could widen the gulf between government and opposition. The regime says \n     Burma will become a multi-party democracy after the new \n     constitution is drafted, but it has not provided a timetable.\n       Aung San Suu Kyi, however, said the boycott was necessary. \n     ``They won't even talk to us,'' she said with a laugh. ``How \n     could the gulf be widened? It can only be narrowed.''\n       As for the military's intentions in convening the \n     constitutional convention, one Western embassy official, \n     reflecting a widely held view, said, ``The path which seems \n     to be one chosen would lead to the drafting of a constitution \n     which calls for transition that ensures civilian rule on the \n     front end, with continued real authority being held \n     indefinitely by the military.''\n       One of the guidelines for the proposed constitution \n     guarantees a ``leading role'' for the military in politics, \n     and another bans anyone married to a foreigner from assuming \n     the office of president. Aung San Suu Kyi is married to \n     Michael Aris, a British academic.\n       She has continued to talk of compromise. ``We have always \n     said we want to talk over our differences to find an answer \n     that's acceptable to everyone,'' she said. ``We have never \n     closed any doors and are open to any discussions which might \n     result in what's best for Burma's people.''\n       Aung San Suu Kyi insists that her party has no timetable \n     for transition to democracy, and she avoids being locked into \n     any one scenario by saying that the situation is so prone to \n     change.\n       But Burma is very much at a crossroads now. After years of \n     sealed borders and international ostracism, the government is \n     actively seeking investment, tourism and political \n     legitimacy.\n       Aung San Suu Kyi, who has been outspoken in urging foreign \n     investors to ``jolly well wait'' before bringing business \n     into the country, said, ``Luxury hotels do not mean a \n     developed Burma.''\n       Her photogenic presence, Oxford education, revered \n     lineage--her father was the hero of Burma's independence--and \n     her absence from Burma during the 1970s and '80s, which \n     distanced her from factional infighting within the democrats' \n     diverse coalition, make her a magnet for Burma's \n     discontented.\n       Encounters in Burma's remote interior confirm her \n     widespread support. A shop owner in Yaunghwe, in Shan State, \n     made sure the coast was clear and proudly showed off a T-\n     shirt picturing Aung San Suu Kyi with her quote, ``Fear is a \n     habit. I am not afraid,'' on the back. A Buddhist monk in \n     Mandalay, flipping through an English guidebook, came across \n     her photo and exclaimed, ``Do you know who this is? Do you? \n     This is our national heroine.''\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n Statement of Mr. Yozo Yokota, Special Rapporteur of the Commission on \n    Human Rights on the Situation of Human Rights in Myanmar to the \n                Fiftieth Session of the General Assembly\n\n       Mr. President, I am here before you for the fourth time \n     since the creation of my mandate by the Commission on Human \n     Rights in March 1992. And, for the fourth time, I have the \n     duty to bring to your attention any progress made toward the \n     restoration of democracy and protection of human rights in \n     Myanmar.\n       Mr. President, in the interim report which is brought \n     before your Assembly, I provided on the basis of the \n     information received a summary of allegations reported to \n     have occurred in Myanmar during this last year. This include; \n     summary executions, arbitrary detention, torture and forced \n     labour. On purpose, I did not draw any conclusions or \n     recommendations in my interim report. To do so, I found it \n     necessary, in accordance with Commission on Human Rights and \n     General Assembly resolutions, to establish or continue direct \n     contact with the Government and people of Myanmar in order to \n     verify the information received and to analyze its content. \n     To my regret, however, such direct contacts in the form of a \n     visit to Myanmar and Thailand were not possible before the \n     deadline for the submission of the interim report.\n       Mr. President, at the invitation of the Government of \n     Myanmar by a letter of the Minister for Foreign Affairs dated \n     28 September 1995, I undertook a visit to the Union of \n     Myanmar from 8 to 17 October 1995. From 17 to 20 October \n     1995, I visited and met with some Myanmar ethnic minorities \n     in Thailand, along the Thai/Myanmar border, to ascertain the \n     situation of human rights within Myanmar for these ethnic \n     minorities namely: Karenni, Shan and Karen.\n       While in Yangon, my office, accommodation and local \n     transport were provided by the UNDP Office in Myanmar, to \n     which I wish to express my deep gratitude.\n       Mr. President, I wish to note with special gratitude that \n     the Government of Myanmar facilitated the visit, including \n     the travel within Myanmar to Kachin State in Myitkyina and \n     Eastern Shan State in Kyaingtone and to Myitkina and Insein \n     prisons, and extended me many courtesies.\n       During this visit, I was received by a number of high-level \n     government officials including Lieutenant General Khin Nyunt, \n     Secretary One of the State Law and Order Restoration Council \n     (SLORC), the Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs, the Chief \n     Justice, the Minister for Information, the Minister for \n     National Planning and Economic Development, the Minister for \n     Home Affairs and other high level authorities.\n       During my stay in Yangon, I also had the opportunity to \n     meet twice with Dow Jung San Suu Kyi at her private home. \n     Former NLD Chairmen U Kyi Maung and U Tin Oo, the actual \n     Chairman and other NLD representatives were also present.\n       During these meetings, I enjoyed a frank, open and lengthy \n     exchange of views which touched upon most issues of concern \n     for restoration of democracy and respect of human rights in \n     Myanmar. I was informed about the new composition of the \n     Executive Committee of the National League for Democracy \n     which is as follow: U Aung Shwe as Chairman; U Kyi Maung and \n     U Tin Oo as Deputy Chairmen, Daw Aung San Suu Kyi as General-\n     Secretary and U Lwin as Secretary.\n       According to NLD leaders only peace, public order and \n     dialogue may lead to democratization. Therefore, as a mature \n     political party, NLD does not want to return to the situation \n     which was prevailing in 1988 or to act in vengeance. As a \n     responsible political party, NLD is able to control its \n     supporters. Their only aim is to promote a genuine dialogue \n     with the Government of Myanmar.\n       While in Myanmar, I also had the opportunity to see the \n     representatives of the three political parties participating \n     in the National Convention, namely, the Union Kayene League, \n     the National League for Democracy and the National Unity \n     Party. In spite of my strong and repeated requests to meet \n     with them in private at my office in the UNDP compound in \n     Yangon. I regret to say that, this year again, the meetings \n     with these political leaders were arranged to take place at a \n     Government guest house. The location and atmosphere were not \n     conducive to a free and unencumbered exchange of views.\n       With regard to the detention of political prisoners, I must \n     express my disappointment that this year, despite a formal \n     written request before going to Myanmar and despite my \n     repeated requests while in Myanmar, I was not permitted to \n     see any such prisoner neither in Isein prison nor in Myitkina \n     Jail.\n       With regard to the National Convention. I was not able to \n     observe its meetings because it was not in session when I \n     visited Myanmar this time. However, information from reliable \n     sources indicates that it is not heading towards restoration \n     of democracy, I am particularly disappointed to learn that \n     the Government has not yet distributed the Myanmar language \n     version of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights to all \n     delegates to the National Convention.\n       At the completion of my visit to Myanmar, I proceeded from \n     17 to 20 October 1995, to Thailand, to visit displaced \n     persons from Myanmar in the area of Mae Hong Son and Mae \n     Sariang, where, I established or continued contact with the \n     people of Myanmar living in camps. Let me also take this \n     opportunity to express my deep gratitude to the Government of \n     Thailand who facilitated my visit to the camps.\n       Mr. President, I now wish to summarize my observations on \n     the human rights situation in Myanmar on the basis of the \n     allegations received, my recent visit to that country and \n     Thailand and of the information received from various \n     sources, including the Government officials and people of \n     Myanmar, staff members of the United Nations and other \n     specialised agencies, staff members of active human rights \n     and humanitarian non-governmental organizations, foreign \n     government officials, journalists, scholars and students.\n       Since there has been no time to study carefully the \n     information and documents collected during my visits to \n     Myanmar and Thailand, these observations will have to be \n     still preliminary in nature. The full account of my findings, \n     observations and recommendations will be reflected in my \n     final report to the Commission on Human Rights, which I \n     intend to submit at the beginning of next year.\n\n\n                        preliminary observations\n\n       First of all, there are some developments which may lead to \n     improvements in human rights situation in that country.\n       a. The Government of Myanmar continued to release political \n     prisoners in 1995 although the exact number could not be \n     verified. I was particularly pleased to note that among these \n     released detainees were two prominent political party leaders \n     from the National League for Democracy, U Kyi Maung and U Tin \n     Oo, the latter of whom I met in Insein Prison in 1993 and \n     1994.\n       I have also welcomed with great satisfaction the \n     announcement, made on 10 July 1995, that restrictions on Daw \n     Aung San Suu Kyi were lifted by the Government of Myanmar and \n     that she has been released. I am particularly pleased to note \n     that she was released without conditions and is now free to \n     meet with people and free to travel within the country.\n       b. Since the release of Daw Aung San Suu Kyi, a crowd of \n     two to three thousand people is gathering every weekend, \n     Saturdays and Sundays, outside the gate of her residence to \n     hear what Daw Aung San Suu Kyi and other leaders say. During \n     my visit to Myanmar, I witnessed personally one of these \n     gatherings. The atmosphere was peaceful and the crowd of \n     supporters were disciplined. To my knowledge none of these \n     meetings had disorder. To my knowledge none of the supporters \n     was threatened or arrested for having attended such meetings.\n       Yet, I have to state that last week, on Saturday 18 \n     November among the crowd which gathered that day to listen to \n     Daw Aung San Suu Kyi's speech, I have been informed by \n     reliable sources that three NLD members were arrested for \n     having intervened with the police who was erecting barricades \n     in front of her house. According to the information \n\n[[Page S 18272]]\n     received, the three persons were charged with assaulting a police \n     officer and were reportedly sentenced two days later to two \n     years imprisonment. Although I have no details of the trial \n     proceedings, it would appear that the accused could \n     not possibly mount an effective defense with regard to the \n     legal and factual basis for the arrest and incarceration \n     in such a short period of time.\n       c. Cooperation with the Office of the United Nations High \n     Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) is continuing and more than \n     190,000 Myanmar refugees out of estimated total of about \n     250,000 have so far been repatriated from neighbouring \n     Bangladesh.\n       d. The Government is expanding cooperation with various \n     other United Nations bodies and specialised agencies such as \n     UNDP, UNICEF and UNDCP. Year after year, the work of the \n     humanitarian non-governmental organizations is slowly \n     expanding. Now, these organisations are allowed to implement \n     programmes outside Yangon and able to reach out grass-root \n     people who suffer from shortage or lack of food, safe water, \n     medicine, medical care and proper education.\n       e. In cities like Yangon, Myitkyina and Kyaningtone, I \n     observed that there were visible signs of relaxation of \n     tension in the life of the people. It seems that people \n     generally enjoy normal life. There were many consumer goods \n     in market places where many shoppers crowded. Physical \n     developments in the construction or improvement of roads, \n     bridges, buildings and railways are taking place throughout \n     the country and in some border areas. However, just as last \n     year, I was informed that only a small portion of the \n     population enjoy the improved life and the majority who were \n     poor rather suffered from higher prices of basic necessity \n     goods such as rice and medicine.\n       f. On the particular question of forced labour, I was \n     informed during my recent mission to Myanmar that the SLORC \n     had issued a ``secret directive'' to discourage the practice \n     of forced labour. I am hopeful that this directive would be \n     implemented rigorously.\n       g. As Special Rapporteur, I welcome the signature of \n     several cease-fire agreements between the Government of \n     Myanmar and different ethnic minorities. This is without \n     doubt a positive step towards peace. Needless to say, such \n     agreements should be faithfully respected by both parties.\n       Mr. President, in spite of these developments. I have the \n     duty to state that there are still many restrictions on \n     fundamental freedoms and serious violations of human rights \n     continuing in Myanmar.\n       a. As mentioned above, I welcome the recent release of a \n     number of political prisoners. However, I remain concerned \n     about the fact that there are still more than several hundred \n     persons imprisoned or detained for reasons of political \n     activities. I am also concerned about the prevalence of a \n     complex array of security laws which allow the Government \n     sweeping powers of arbitrary arrest and detention These laws \n     include the 1950 Emergency Provisions Act, the 1975 State \n     Protection Law, the 1962 Printers and Publishers Registration \n     Law, the 1923 Official Secrets Act and the 1908 Unlawful \n     Association Act.\n       Various articles in these laws continue to be used in \n     combination to prosecute a number of individuals who were \n     exercising their rights to freedom of expression and \n     association. The combination of charges under these laws \n     included ones such as writing and distributing what were \n     described as ``illegal leaflets, spreading false information \n     injurious to the state'' and ``contact with illegal \n     organisations''. I understand that due to such laws and other \n     SLORC orders, the activities of the political parties, \n     particularly the NLD, are severely restricted.\n       b. Severe court sentences for some political leaders have \n     been reported and confirmed. Information from reliable \n     sources indicates that there are problems in the field of the \n     administration of justice with regard to fair trials, free \n     access to defense lawyers, proportionality between the acts \n     committed and the punishment applied and time for careful \n     examination of the case by courts.\n       c. The non-acceptance by Myanmar of ICRC's customary \n     procedures for visits for places of detention is a negative \n     step towards amelioration of their conditions.\n       d. There are still cases of torture, arbitrary killings, \n     rapes, and confiscation of private property according to \n     testimony and evidence acquired by me. They seem to be taking \n     place most frequently in border areas by military soldiers in \n     the course of military operations, forced relocations and \n     development projects. Many of the victims of such atrocious \n     acts belong to ethnic national populations, especially women, \n     peasants, daily wage earners and other peaceful civilians who \n     do not have enough money to avoid mistreatment by bribing.\n       e. I am gravely concerned at the continued reports of \n     forced porterage, forced labour, forced relocation which are \n     still occurring in border areas where the Army is engaged in \n     military operations or where ``regional development \n     projects'' are taking place.\n\n\n                      preliminary recommendations\n\n       a. As Special Rapporteur, I urge the Government of Myanmar \n     to sign and ratify the Covenants on Civil and Political \n     Rights and Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, the Optional \n     Protocol to the Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, as \n     well as the Convention Against Torture and Other Cruel, \n     Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment and the \n     Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination \n     against Women.\n       b. The Government of Myanmar should comply with the \n     obligations under the International Labour Organization (ILO) \n     Convention No. 29 prohibiting the practice of forced \n     portering and other forced labour.\n       c. Myanmar law should be brought into line with accepted \n     international standards regarding protection of the physical \n     integrity rights. Among these international standards are the \n     right to life, prohibition of torture, providing humane \n     conditions for all persons under detention and insurance of \n     the minimum standards of judicial guarantees.\n       d. The Government of Myanmar should take steps to \n     facilitate and guarantee enjoyment of the freedoms of \n     opinions, expression and association, in particular by \n     decriminalizing the expression of oppositional views, \n     relinquishing government control over the media and literary \n     and artistic community, and permitting the formation of \n     independently organized trade unions.\n       e. All persons including elected political representatives, \n     students, workers, peasants, monks and others arrested or \n     detained under martial law after the 1988 and 1990 \n     demonstrations or as a result of the National Convention, \n     should be tried by a properly constituted and independent \n     civilian court in an open and internationally accessible \n     judicial process. If found guilty in such judicial \n     proceedings, they should be given a just sentence; \n     alternatively, they should be immediately released and the \n     Government refrain from all acts of intimidation, threats or \n     reprisals against them or their families.\n       f. As Special Rapporteur. I recommend the Government of \n     Myanmar to repeal or amend as appropriate the relevant \n     provisions which at present prevent the ICRC from carrying \n     out its humanitarian activities as regards the prison visits. \n     In this regard, I encourage the Government of Myanmar, in a \n     spirit of humanitarian goodwill, to re-invite the presence in \n     Myanmar of the International Committee of the Red Cross in \n     order to carry out their purely humanitarian tasks.\n       g. The Government of Myanmar should publicize the ``secret \n     directive'' which discourage the practice of forced labour. \n     This will indicate and the will of the Government of Myanmar \n     to effectively prohibit and suppress forced labour. Moreover, \n     wide dissemination of the existence of the directive would \n     promote awareness that forced labour is neither condoned nor \n     tolerated.\n       h. The Government of Myanmar should without delay resume \n     its dialogue with Daw Aung San Suu Kyi.\n       i. As Special Rapporteur. I call upon the Government of \n     Myanmar to resolve peacefully its difficulties with ethnic \n     minorities and to take all appropriate measures to ensure \n     respect for human rights and humanitarian obligations in the \n     situation of armed conflicts between the Myanmar Army and the \n     armed ethnic groups.\n       j. The Government of Myanmar should distribute copies of \n     the Universal Declaration of Human Rights in Myanmar language \n     to all delegates to National Convention which is to be \n     reconvened tomorrow. 28 November 1995. Such action would \n     indicate to the international community the willingness of \n     the Government to bring the relevant provisions of the \n     domestic laws, in particular the new Constitution to be \n     eventually enacted into conformity with international human \n     rights standards.\n       Mr. President, I have analyzed these allegations and have \n     made some recommendations strictly in terms of the \n     international human rights obligations which Myanmar has \n     freely undertaken. I am particularly thinking of the fact \n     that Myanmar is a Member of the United Nations and is \n     therefore bound to respect the human rights standards \n     emanating from the United Nations Charter. I believe the \n     Government of Myanmar should, and has the ability, to fulfill \n     in good faith the obligations it has assumed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/12/08/senate-section/article/S18268-1", "month": "12", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "08", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S18272-S18286]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               FLAG DESECRATION CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT\n\n  The Senate continued with the consideration of the joint resolution.\n  Mr. KERREY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, I come to the floor to speak on Senate \nJoint Resolution 31, the proposed resolution that would present to the \nStates the opportunity to amend the U.S. Constitution for the 20th \ntime. It is a very straightforward, simple proposal that I believe is \nnot necessary and would, indeed, create an environment that would \nproduce, potentially, the opposite of that which we seek to produce, or \nat least, as I hear, proponents of this amendment are seeking to \nproduce--and that is, that our people have at least one symbol that \nthey respect, that we have a unifying symbol, which is our flag, and \nthat the flag creates, as a consequence of our reverence for it, a \nsense of national purpose, at least in that one instance.\n  This proposal, Mr. President, I believe, is well intended in that \nregard. If I were to identify the thing that troubles me the most about \nour country today, it is the question of whether or not we are \ndeveloping the kind of personal character that is needed for the \n\n[[Page S 18273]]\nNation to have the courage and the strength to respond to whatever may \nhappen to us in the future. That kind of individual character \ndevelopment requires a considerable amount of effort and attention not \njust on the part of young people who are working to acquire it, but \nadults who are working to try to help them. I note, in particular, that \nthis proposal is a top priority of the American Legion and Veterans of \nForeign Wars and the several other service organizations. In both the \nVFW and American Legion's cases, they have as a top priority as well \nworking with young people to help them acquire the capacity to be good \ncitizens, to respect their country, to respect their flag, to respect \ntheir role in a free and independent nation and the requirements that \nfall to us as individuals in a free and independent nation.\n\n  The loss of respect for not just the flag but for many other things \nin our country today troubles not just members of the Legion but \ntroubles almost anybody who is an observer of American life today.\n  I know a couple of days ago, Senator Lieberman and Senator Nunn, \nalong with former Secretary of Education Bill Bennett, made a public \npresentation of proposals to try to deal with the deterioration in the \nquality of presentations made on daytime broadcast television.\n  I listened a couple weeks ago to Senator Nunn on the floor go through \nsome things being broadcast on daytime television, and I had a feeling \nI was on a different planet. Most of us in this body probably do not \nwatch much daytime television, and it was shocking to hear the sorts of \nthings that were being not just discussed, but offered as being OK, \noffered as being acceptable, offered as being sort of a legitimate kind \nof behavior.\n  This deterioration in the quality of our character is a great \nconcern. I see it as a principal motivator behind what I consider, as I \nsaid, to be a well-intended proposal.\n  Mr. President, one of the things I think citizens should understand \nas we consider this constitutional amendment is that our flag is \nalready protected. You cannot burn or desecrate our flag. If it is a \nflag that I own personally, you cannot desecrate my flag. You certainly \ncannot desecrate a flag that you and I own. That is our flag. A flag \nflying over Iwo Jima, the flag that flies at half-mast today around the \nWashington Memorial, flags at cemeteries, flags that we own. That is \nour flag. You cannot desecrate that. It is a violation of current law \nto desecrate in any fashion, to approach in any fashion that would be \ndesecration of our flag under current law.\n  What this legislation proposes to do is say not only are we going to \nprotect our flag, we are going to protect someone else's flag from us.\n  If an individual in their home, for example, has a flag in their home \nand a law is passed, say, in the State of Nebraska, as I think it \nprobably would be, saying that desecration of a flag is a violation of \nthe law, someone could call up and report and say, ``Gee, I saw my \nneighbor do something with the flag in their home and I think it is a \nviolation of law. I think what they were doing with their flag in the \nhome is a violation of the law, and I think you should investigate and \nmake sure they are not desecrating their own flag inside of their \nhome.''\n  Mr. President, I genuinely believe this is going to set off and \ncreate the very sort of division and the very sort of problem that we \nseek to avoid.\n  I think it is, again, a well-intended constitutional amendment, but I \nfor one do not look forward to an opportunity where the people of this \ncountry are debating at the local level whether or not it is a \ndesecration of our flag to have someone sewing the flag on their pants. \nIt may end up being if you are driving down the highway going from, \nsay, California to Florida, it may be legal to have a pair of pants \nwith a flag on it in California; it may be illegal in Texas or \nMississippi or vice versa.\n\n  One may have to get from AAA information about what the various flag \nordinances are from State to State. I think that will, rather than \ncausing us to deepen our respect for the flag and using it as a symbol \nto inspire us--not just us as adults but to help us inspire our young \npeople to consider the sacrifices that have been made under that rather \nglorious symbol--rather than inspiring us, it is apt to cause us to \ndeteriorate into an argument that, frankly, I view as something that \nwill produce a negative, not a constructive, result.\n  This constitutional amendment does not protect our flag. Our flag is \nalready protected. What this does is say it will extend the protection \nof our flag to the protection of somebody else's flag that they have in \ntheir home in any way, shape or form. It will set off a debate about \nwhether or not the Government has the right to come in, and if it is \nsomebody else's property, take action to protect all of us or what they \nmight be doing with their flag.\n  The next thing I say, Mr. President, if the flag was not revered, as \nit clearly is, if it did not set off such a strong emotional reaction, \nI think a majority of Americans who have experienced in some fashion \npeople giving of themselves--if not giving of their lives--as a \nconsequence of being inspired by that flag, if it was not already \nrevered, if there really was a threat to our flag, you would see a \nsubstantial amount of instances out there where people were, as a part \nof expressing their anger with their country or as part of expressing \ntheir anger with something that their Congress is doing or that their \nGovernment has done to then, they would be setting the flags on fire. \nThey are not.\n  The reason they are not is that they know there is a taboo that you \nare breaking, that you are violating something holy, and if you are \ntrying to score a point, if you are trying to persuade somebody of your \npoint of view, the last thing you want to do is to take a flag that \nbelongs to you and desecrate it in any fashion, or let it traipse along \nthe ground, trample it in any way, disrespect the flag at all.\n  Mr. President, again, I know if the answer is no to this \nconstitutional amendment, that Members are going to have to explain to \ncitizens at home or to organizations at home, why are you not simply \nallowing us to express the will of the people? Why do you not just let \nthe Constitution be amended?\n  The clearest answer I can give is that I genuinely believe that this \nconstitutional amendment will produce less respect for the flag, not \nmore respect for the flag. It will make the flag an object of political \ncontroversy. We ought to use the flag to educate our young people, \nrather than telling them that they have to respect the flag at birth \nwithout explaining why, without talking to them and giving them the \nevidence that many of us as adults already have that causes us to tear \nup and feel emotional around the flag, rather than taking the time and \nsaying: This is what the cold war was. This is what we did in World War \nI. There were 50 million people under arms in World War I, and 8 \nmillion men died in World War I. This is what happened in World War II. \nThis is what men and women of this country did in the Second World War. \nThis is what our fighting people did, as well, in Korea, to stop the \nCommunists from coming down from the North. This is what we did in \nVietnam.\n  Even as controversial and as difficult as it was, there was a \nmovement, a desire to give the people of Vietnam freedom. Did it come \noff the tracks? Was it loused up? Yes. But people like myself who \nvolunteered, who served, did so because we believed in freedom. That is \nwhat the flag does stand for. We should not require somebody to respect \nit by passing a law saying, If you violate the law, we will punish you. \nWe should bring them into our presence and say: Understand what \ncharacter is all about. You do not have character if your behavior is \nwillful. You have character if your behavior is obedient--obedient to \nyour parents, obedient to your church, to your synagogue, obedient to \nyour country. That is what character requires us to do.\n  If we simply pass a law and say you have to respect the flag, in my \njudgment, what we are going to do is turn the flag into a political \ninstrument. We are going to diminish its value. We should use it as an \nobject lesson when we are debating the budget, for example, when we are \ndebating anything that requires us to put ourselves on the line, to \ntake risks, to take a chance for freedom, to take a chance for someone \nelse, to say: Rather than just taking care of myself, I am going to \ntake care of somebody else.\n  The description of the young people--and they were all in their late \nteens and early twenties, several hundred \n\n[[Page S 18274]]\nthousand men who landed on the beaches of Normandy 51 years ago--if you \nhear that story, and I had the chance last year to hear it told in \ndetail by men now in their seventies who were on that landing, who went \non that voyage, there was no guarantee. Indeed, many arguments were \ngiven that this thing was going to be a failure. People well informed, \nleaders with great knowledge believed that it would fail, that it would \nnot be successful.\n  The sea conditions that day were rough. They got sick on the voyage \nto France, and they were terrified of the prospect of being killed by \nGerman artillery and German weapons. They knew that their lives could \nend the minute they stepped off of that landing craft. They knew that \nwas a possibility.\n  That is what we should do when it comes to the flag. When it comes \ntime for talking to our young people, teach them why they should \nrespect the flag. The reason why is that these men who serve and women \nwho serve our country today are saying, We are going to be obedient to \nthis country. We are going to follow orders because we believe that \nthere is a moral principle at stake here, and that principle is giving \nourselves to someone else, sacrificing for someone else, paying \nattention, being considerate, being willing to do things that are good \nfor somebody else, rather than simply trying to figure out how to stick \nit to them, how to make them look bad, how to make them feel bad as \nwell.\n\n  The flag will not be a symbol that inspires us if we require respect, \nif we say to our young people: Now, we just amended our Constitution. \nNow we have a law on the books.\n  There was no law on the books in 1941 when this Nation was attacked \nby the Japanese at Pearl Harbor. We did not require that of Americans, \nand say: Under penalty of the police coming into your home, if you \ndesecrate our flag we are somehow going to take action against you. We \nknew what it meant to be patriotic. We knew that this Nation's freedom \nwas at risk and this world's freedom was at stake and responded as a \nconsequence.\n  I have talked to many members of the Legion, the VFW, the DAV, the \nVietnam veterans, American veterans, and many other veterans and \ncitizens of Nebraska who say: Just let us amend our Constitution. Just \nlet us pass a law. Let us do this. That is all we are asking, is for \nthe opportunity to do it.\n  I have to say I am not just sympathetic with that view, I believe I \nunderstand it. I understand what they are trying to do. They are \nconcerned about the loss of respect. They are concerned about the loss \nof respect, not just for the flag--where, in fact, it may be one of the \nicons left in America where there is automatic respect--but the loss of \nrespect for parents, the loss of respect for our leaders, the loss of \nrespect for institutions, the loss of respect for one another; the \nunwillingness to be considerate, the unwillingness to be obedient, the \ndeterioration in the value of serving someone else, of risking your \nlife for someone else's freedom.\n  I understand and believe it is a great challenge for this country to \ntry to build character one person at a time, to say that we are going \nto reach to our youth and inspire them with a narrative of this \ncountry, the stories of this country. The sacrifice that led us to \nwhere we are today should cause anyone who pays attention to the \nhistory of the United States of America to say that our flag deserves \nthe reverence that this constitutional amendment is attempting to give \nit with the force of law.\n  It should be the force of our knowledge, the force of our conscience, \nthe force of our willingness to give it back in kind that causes us to \nrevere this flag, not the force of the police in our local community, \nnot the force that we are afraid something bad is going to happen to us \nif we desecrate the U.S. flag.\n  I hope when it comes time to vote that at least 34 Members of this \nbody will vote against this constitutional amendment, not because we \nbelieve that the flag should not be revered, not because we are not \nconcerned for the loss of respect for it and other institutions in this \ncountry, but for precisely the opposite reason. I hope this debate does \nnot lead us down the road to converting the flag into a political \nobject, which I deeply believe it will if we amend our Constitution.\n  I hope we take some stock of ourselves, we read a recent assessment \nthat was done about what our young people and our adults know about the \nhistory of this country, where we came from, how it was we got to where \nwe are today. We see a daunting challenge ahead of us. Far too many \nAmericans do not know how it is that we got to where we are today. Far \ntoo many Americans still believe that freedom is somehow free, that it \nis our birthright, and that we need do nothing to remain free. It is \nours; we have a right to it; we can do whatever we want with it. We can \nact and behave in a willful fashion. We do not have to regard at all \nthe feelings or lives not only of other people in our presence, but our \nfuture as well.\n\n  I know the challenge that this constitutional amendment presents to \ncolleagues is a rather substantial one. You fear you are going to be \naccused of not being in favor of protecting our flag if you vote \nagainst it. I hope, as I said, 34 Members will at least stand on this \nfloor sometime next week when it comes up and say that because we \nrespect this flag of ours, because we believe that it should be \nrevered, because we believe that Americans should make the choice, the \npersonal choice based upon a personal and active knowledge of what this \nflag represents, that they will say we do not need a law to cause us to \nbehave in the fashion that we know is right. We do not need to amend \nour Constitution to get us to respect Old Glory.\n\n\n                      Unanimous-Consent Agreement\n\n  Mr. MACK. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the following \namendments be the only amendments in order to Senate Joint Resolution \n31, and they must be offered and debated during Monday's session of the \nSenate: McConnell, relevant substitute; Hatch, two relevant amendments; \nBiden, relevant; Feinstein, relevant; Hollings, two relevant \namendments.\n  I further ask that at 9 a.m. on Tuesday, December 12, there be 1 hour \n40 minutes for closing debate, to be equally divided in the usual form, \nand the votes occur on or in relation to the amendments beginning at \n2:17 p.m., with the first vote limited to the standard 15 minutes and \nall remaining stacked votes limited to 10 minutes in length, with 2 \nminutes for debate prior to the votes for explanation to be equally \ndivided in the usual form.\n  I further ask unanimous consent that following the disposition of the \namendments, the joint resolution be read for a third time and a final \nvote occur immediately without any intervening action or debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. MACK. In light of this agreement, there will be no rollcall votes \nduring Monday's session of the Senate and any votes ordered with \nrespect to amendments and the final vote will occur beginning at 2:17 \np.m. on Tuesday, December 12, 1995.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I strongly support Senate Joint Resolution \n31, which amends the Constitution to protect the flag of the United \nStates from those who would desecrate it.\n  The American flag is a national symbol of the values this country was \nfounded on. Many Americans have fought and died to defend these values \nand this country. It is an insult to these patriots, their relatives, \nand all other citizens who hold this country dear, to burn or desecrate \nthe symbol of our nation and our freedom.\n  I certainly support the right of all citizens to freedom of speech, \nbut that right has never been absolute in our country. That's why there \nare laws against libel, slander, perjury, and obscenity. Similarly, our \nfreedom of political expression is also limited. No one can legally \ndeface the Supreme Court building or the Washington Monument, no matter \nhow much he or she might wish to protest a particular government policy \nor law. The American flag, as the symbol of all the great values this \ncountry stands for, deserves special protection under the Constitution. \nIt simply is not necessary to commit an act of violence against this \nflag to register protest against the government. Passage of Senate \nJoint Resolution 31 will help ensure our national symbol receives the \nrespect and protection it deserves. \n\n[[Page S 18275]]\n\n  Again, Mr. President, I offer my strong support for Senate Joint \nResolution 31 and I urge my colleagues to support it as well.\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, today we consider a constitutional \namendment which allows States to enact laws to protect the American \nflag. I am cosponsor of this amendment and I strongly believe that it \nis necessary to render this protection to the most important symbol of \nour Nation.\n  The debate about the flag began in 1989 when the Supreme Court \ncuriously determined that it was perfectly legal to burn the American \nflag as a form of political speech. This ruling led to shock and \noutrage from all across the United States. Congress immediately took \naction, passing a statute setting penalties for anyone who physically \ndesecrates the flag. The Supreme Court ruled again that the Federal \nstatute was unconstitutional, violating the first amendment.\n  Unfortunately, the Senate failed to pass a constitutional amendment \nto protect the flag. Today, however, we are very near this goal, with \n56 cosponsors to the amendment.\n  The amendment reads simply ``The Congress and the States shall have \npower to prohibit the physical desecration of the flag of the United \nStates.''\n  I feel an overwhelming mixture of regret and thanks--which is the \nsubstance of patriotism--when I consider the sacrifice of so many for \nthe sake of America. This pride is rooted in one solid and \nextraordinary fact--the selflessness of thousands of men and women who \nhave given their lives to preserve American freedom.\n  I believe for the vast majority of Americans the flag intrinsically \nrepresents this pride. Americans do not blindly follow traditions. But \nwe do care deeply about symbols--particularly that one symbol of ideas \nand values for which men and women have sacrificed and died in every \ngeneration. To desecrate the flag, I believe, is to desecrate the \nmemory and make light of their sacrifice.\n  Justice Stevens writing in dissent to the 1989 Supreme Court decision \nsaid:\n\n       So it is with the American flag. It is more than a proud \n     symbol of the courage, the determination, and the gifts of \n     nature that transformed 13 fledgling colonies into a world \n     power. It is a symbol of freedom, of equal opportunity, of \n     religious tolerance, and of good will for other peoples who \n     share our aspirations. The symbol carries its message to \n     dissenters both at home and abroad who may have no interest \n     at all in our national unity or survival.\n\n  There is a type of patriotism that is held so deeply that if finds \nexpression in concrete things like a patriot's crippled body--or in \nbits of colored cloth. For men who have risked death in service of a \nflag it is more than just a symbol, it is sacrifice you can hold in \nyour hand--or trample underfoot in contempt.\n  Men and women who we ask to die for a flag have a right to expect \nthat flag to be respected by those who benefit from their sacrifice. It \nis part of the compact we make with those who will serve. At the time \nof the Supreme Court decision, it was the law in 48 States. Since that \ntime, 49 State legislatures have called for a constitutional amendment \nto prohibit physical desecration of the flag. No other amendment in our \nhistory has had the same degree of support in State legislatures.\n  Tolerance is an important thing in a free and diverse society. \nAgreement must never be a prerequisite for civility. But tolerance can \nnever be rooted in the view that nothing is worth outrage because \nnothing is worth our sacrifice.\n  In Chief Justice Rehnquist's stinging dissent to the court decision, \nlabeled flag burning as ``conduct that is regarded as evil and \noffensive to the majority of people--in a category with--murder, \nembezzlement or pollution.'' The Court's ruling, he noted, ``found that \nthe American flag is just another symbol, about which not only must \nopinions pro and con be tolerated, but for which the most minimal \npublic respect may not be enjoined. The Government may conscript men \ninto the Armed Forces where they must fight and die for the flag, but \nthe Government may not prohibit the public burning of the banner under \nwhich they fight.''\n  Yes, we must be tolerant but we must never adopt and enervating and \ncowardly disdain that strips us of patriotic conviction and dulls our \nability to be offended by the desecration of vital symbols. ``In the \nworld it is called tolerance,'' wrote author Dorothy Sayers, ``but in \nhell it is called despair * * * the sin that believes in nothing, cares \nfor nothing, enjoys nothing, finds purpose in nothing, lives for \nnothing, and remains alive because there is nothing for which it will \ndie.''\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, yesterday we marked the bombing of Pearl \nHarbor. Many of us can still remember the gripping of our hearts 54 \nyears ago today, as the realization spread over us that nothing would \never again be quite the same. Yet, I think it is fair to say that there \nis already a whole generation of Americans who have no grasp of the \nmeaning World War II has for so many of us. Young people who might \nnever hear a parent or a grandparent tell of the time they felt their \ncommitment to a way of life being tested, of a time they could finally \nclose their eyes and rest, knowing an important fight had been won on \nthe world stage.\n  But when those same young people turn their eyes toward this \ncountry's flag, I know they understand that in its fabric was woven the \ndramas of thousands of battles fought on the shores of foreign lands \nand over the lunch counters or Main Streets of our own home towns.\n  There are many good reasons for protecting the unique symbol of the \nAmerican flag, from the basic liberties it represents to the promise of \na better future it holds out. But some of the greatest reasons for \nprotecting the flag lie in its ability to bind one generation to the \nnext in their love and respect for this country, so that even as the \nmemories of yesterday's battles begin to fade, the importance of what \nthey secured continues to hold fast in our hearts.\n  A flag that flies proudly in this country serves as a reminder of how \nwar can change the course of a life, of a nation, of a world, so that \neven individuals who were never there, who might never have heard the \nstories, recognize that those hours of destruction and suffering have \naltered the future irrevocably, and that their own liberty was a hard \nwon prize.\n  It follows then that a desecrated flag mocks the millions who have \nreached out or fought for all that our flag symbolizes, from the basic \nliberties written into our Constitution to the dreams of a better \nfuture for their families.\n  That's why I believe so strongly that the physical integrity of the \nAmerican flag must be protected. Back in 1989, the U.S. Supreme Court \ndeclared unconstitutional a Texas flag desecration statute, ruling that \nflag desecration was free speech protected under the first amendment.\n  In response to that decision, the Senate overwhelmingly passed the \nFlag Protection Act, which was also declared unconstitutional. The \nSupreme Court's action made it clear that a constitutional amendment is \nnecessary for enactment of any binding protection of the flag.\n  Up to this point, neither House of Congress has been able to garner \nthe two-thirds super majority necessary for passage of a constitutional \namendment. But because grassroots support for this amendment continues \nto grow, I've joined with Members on both sides of the aisle to again \ntry passing this amendment. I'm hopeful that this time we'll get the \nnecessary votes.\n  Clearly no legitimate act of political protest should be suppressed. \nNor should we ever discourage debate and discussion about the federal \ngovernment. The narrowly written amendment gives Congress and the \nStates the ``power to prohibit the physical desecration of the Flag of \nthe United States,'' without jeopardizing those rights of free speech.\n  On July 14, 1861 a Union soldier wrote his last letter to his wife. \nHe said:\n\n       My courage does not halt or falter. I know how American \n     civilization now bears upon the triumph of the government and \n     how great a debt we owe to those who went before us through \n     the blood and suffering of the Revolution, and I am willing, \n     perfectly willing, to lay down all my joys in this life to \n     help maintain this government and pay that debt.\n\n  Today, our task here in the Senate seems trivial in comparison. But \nif we want the flag that hangs in school rooms, over courthouses, in \nsports stadiums and off front porches all across America, to continue \nsymbolizing that same commitment to country, then it is a challenge we \ncannot fail to meet. \n\n[[Page S 18276]]\n\n  Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to join me in voting in favor of \nthis important legislation.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I see present the distinguished Senator \nfrom Ohio on the floor, and I just wish to inform him that I will only \nbe speaking for about 2 or 3 minutes.\n  Mr. President, I am a cosponsor of the flag protection constitutional \namendment, and I am privileged to join my colleagues in cosponsoring \nthis very important piece of legislation.\n  It is of tremendous interest to the constituents of the State of \nVirginia, and particularly those who are members of the American Legion \nand the VFW--both organizations I am privileged to be a member of--and \nother service organizations. I want to salute their contribution and \nsupport toward this legislation.\n  Today, as I move about the Halls of the U.S. Senate, I have had the \nopportunity to meet members of those service organizations who come \nhere today to speak to Members and otherwise encourage the strongest \nsupport for this legislation. I salute them.\n  Those who have been privileged to wear the uniform of our country \nhave a constant--what I call--trustee relationship to that flag, a very \nspecial trustee relationship.\n  I served briefly in World War II in the U.S. Navy, and then for a \nsecond period of active duty service in the U.S. Marines during the \nKorean war with a brief period of service in Korea. I have always \nlooked upon those opportunities as a privilege. I would not be a U.S. \nSenator today had it not been for the training that I received both in \nthe U.S. Navy and in the U.S. Marine Corps. I have always felt that my \nduty here as a U.S. Senator as one to pay back--particularly those \nyoung men and women now wearing the uniform of our country--all that I \nhave received by way of not only education but the first lessons of \nwhat leadership means.\n  I served my country very humbly--never to be added to the columns of \nthose who served with great valor. But I did volunteer twice to do my \nduty, as others saw fit.\n  That is all a part of what we are incorporating in the support of \nthis resolution because those of us who served remember so well the \nmany friends that marched with us, or flew with us, or sailed with us--\nwhatever the case may be--who paid the ultimate price, many others who \ncame back with loss of limb and still bear the scars of war.\n\n  So I wish to pay special recognition to all and to speak in a very \nhumble manner on their behalf and thank them for their contribution in \nmaking possible this legislation and what I hope will be the adoption \nby the Senate.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, to take up the issue before us on a \nconstitutional amendment regarding the flag is a very difficult thing \nto do. The different expressions on the floor are certainly ones to \nconsider whether people are for the amendment or against the amendment. \nIt is very difficult because the feelings run so deep in both \ndirections. I do not know whether there is anyone who is still on the \nfence with regard to their views on this matter.\n  Until today, I have not said a much about this. I talked about it in \nthe Chamber several years ago when we had the issue before us. But I \nthink people who have very deep feelings on this can have their \nfeelings and we respect those feelings. I do not quarrel one iota with \npeople on the other side of the aisle who have their feelings for \nwhatever reason. But I do think there is a danger here. I think the \ndanger is that the flag does not need the protection in this argument. \nWhat needs protection is really the Bill of Rights, from those who \nwould look at it rather superficially from my view.\n  So until today, I have tended to hold my tongue and have kept my \npeace about this issue before us because it is no fun being attacked or \nbeing labeled as unpatriotic or a friend of flag burners. And I can \nassure you that I am neither simply because I have doubts about the \nwisdom of a constitutional flag burning amendment. I am not taking the \nfloor to speak about this issue, as I say, because some of our feelings \nabout the flag are difficult to discuss. Feelings run very deep and \nvery strong. Let me make a few things very clear up front.\n  We all, of course, love the flag, and I would say nobody in this \nChamber or this country loves our flag more than I do. We all can make \nthat same statement on the floor. I fought hard for this flag through \ntwo wars and representing the country in the space program, and so on. \nI am both honored and proud that few people in this Nation have been \nable to take this flag where I took it, at least on the first space \nflight. That is the first thing I selected when I had a personal \npreference pack, as they called it, along on the trip. I took along \nlittle silk flags so I could give them to my children, and they remain \namong my children's most cherished possessions to this day.\n  I also know, more importantly, from my own personal experience that \nevery last fiber, every stitch, every thread in that flag can be looked \nat as standing for someone who gave their life to defend it. At my age, \nI can tell you that I probably have more friends buried over in \nArlington Cemetery bearing silent witness to our flag as I do bearing \npublic witness to it in the world of the living. Maybe that is why I \nhave so little patience and even less sympathy for those pathetic and \ninsensitive few who would demean and defile our Nation's greatest \nsymbol of sacrifice, the flag of the United States of America.\n  Those are some of the reasons I have kept silent until now. It is now \nclear that a legislative alternative to amending our Constitution is \nprobably not going to be possible before we have to vote on this. It is \nnow equally clear that those of us who question the wisdom of watering \ndown our Bill of Rights have no choice but to stand up to the political \nmud merchants in some respects, from some of the comments that have \nbeen made, and to speak out against those who would deal in demagoguery \non this issue.\n  It is now clear that those of us who remember and care deeply about \nthe sacrifices made on behalf of freedom have a special responsibility, \nand we do, to point out that it would be a hollow victory, indeed, if \nwe preserved the symbol of our freedoms by chipping away at those \nfreedoms themselves. That is the important choice here. Are we to \nprotect the symbol at the expense of even taking a small chance at \nchipping away at the freedoms that that symbol represents?\n  On that score, let us be honest with each other and with the American \npeople. The flag is this Nation's most powerful and emotional symbol, \nand it is. I have been here with Senator Kerrey once in the Chamber \nwhen he said he thought in Nebraska they did not need this because if \nsomebody started to burn a flag, they would take care of it themselves \nright then and there and on the spot. And I agree with that. Back home \nin Ohio, we have almost 11 million people, and I think there are very \nfew, who, if they saw a flag being burned, would not be willing to take \naction against that person or persons. It is a gut feeling. I feel that \nsame way myself, and I would join into that.\n  But we have to think a little longer score on this, it seems to me. \nSo the flag is the Nation's most powerful and emotional symbol, and it \nis our sacred symbol. It is a revered symbol, but it is a symbol. It \nsymbolizes the freedoms we have in this country, but it is not the \nfreedoms themselves. And that is why this debate is not between those \nwho love the flag on the one hand and those who do not on the other, no \nmatter how often the demagogs try to tell us otherwise. Everyone on \nboth sides of the aisle politically within this Chamber and everyone on \nboth sides of this debate loves and respects the flag. The question is \nhow best to honor it, to honor it and what it represents.\n  Those who made the ultimate sacrifice for our flag did not give up \ntheir lives for just a piece of cloth, albeit red, white, and blue, and \nit had some stars on it. Not just for the flag. They died because of \ntheir allegiance to this country, to the values and the rights and \nprinciples represented by that flag and to the Republic for which it \nstands.\n  Without a doubt, the most important of those values, the most \nimportant of \n\n[[Page S 18277]]\nthose values, rights and principles is individual liberty, the liberty \nto worship and think, to express ourselves freely, openly and \ncompletely, no matter how out of step those views may be with the \nopinions of the majority. And that is what is so unique about this \ncountry of ours--unique among all the nations around this world--\nBritain, France, you name them, any place where they have democracy, \nbut ours is especially unique in that regard.\n  That commitment to freedom is encapsulated, it is encoded in our Bill \nof Rights, perhaps the most envied and imitated document anywhere in \nthe world. The Bill of Rights is what makes our country unique. It is \nwhat has made us a shining beacon in a dark world, a shining beacon of \nhope and inspiration to oppressed peoples around the world for well \nover 200 years. It is, in short, what makes America America.\n  You may look back a little bit. You know, the Bill of Rights came \ninto being because the States at that time were not going to approve \nthe Constitution unless we had some of these additional protections \nincluded. And so those additional protections that were to be included \nbecame known as the Bill of Rights. They are the first series of \namendments to the Constitution. Those States were only prepared to \naccept the Constitution with the understanding that these additional \nprotections for each individual and each individual's rights were \nincorporated in that Constitution.\n  That is how the Bill of Rights came to be. The very first item in \nthat Bill of Rights, the first amendment in it to our Constitution has \nnever been changed or altered even one single time. In all of American \nhistory, over 7,000 attempts have been made to put amendments through. \nJust 27 have gotten through, and there was not a single time in all of \nAmerican history when this was changed, not during our Civil War even, \nnot during the Civil War when passions ran so high and this Nation was \ndrenched in blood like few nations have been throughout their history. \nThat Constitution was not changed. It was not changed during any of our \nforeign wars. It was not changed during recessions. It was not changed \nduring depressions. It was not changed during scares or panics or \nwhatever happened in this country.\n  That Bill of Rights has not been changed even during times of great \nemotion and anger like the Vietnam era, when flags were burned or \ndesecrated far more than they are today. Our first amendment was \nunchanged, unchallenged, as much as we might have disagreed with what \nwas going on at that time, as abhorrent as we found the actions of a \nlot of people at that time in their protests against the Vietnam war. \nBut now we are told that unless we alter the first amendment, unless we \nplace a constitutional limit on the right of speech and expression that \nthe fabric of our country will somehow be weakened. Well, I just cannot \nbring myself to believe that that is the case.\n  I think once the American people think this issue clear through, I do \nnot think they will buy it, either, whether this passes or not. I do \nnot think the American people will buy it. Once you get past the first \ngut feeling, if you saw a flag burning, of doing something about it, as \nI would--so many of the people who visited me in my office the last \ncouple of days would do the same thing--would take action themselves \nagainst such activity. Much as that might be the case and satisfying \nthough that might be, I think we have to look at the long term on this, \nget by the emotion of that moment and think what it is we are dealing \nwith.\n  What we are dealing with is the Bill of Rights, dealing with that \nfirst amendment to the Bill of Rights. We are saying for the first time \nin our country's 200-year history, we are going to make, albeit maybe \njust a tiny crack, but it will be a tiny opening that could possibly be \nfollowed by others.\n  That first amendment says, ``Congress shall make no law respecting an \nestablishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof;'' \nor the second item, ``or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the \npress; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to \npetition the Government for a redress of grievances.''\n  The part we are dealing with today is freedom of speech--freedom of \nspeech. We are talking about freedom of expression. The Supreme Court \nhas held on two separate occasions that no matter how much the majority \nof us, 99.999 percent of the people of this country disagree, that \ntiny, tiny, fractional, misguided minority, still under our Bill of \nRights they have the right to their expression. Their expression is \nlooked at as coming under that freedom of speech.\n  You have to look at it from that standpoint. Are we going to even \nmake a tiny opening in changing that first amendment that could be \nfollowed on, if we have a tiny, tiny, tiny minority that we do not \nagree with their religious beliefs, if we have a tiny, tiny, tiny \nminority that we do not agree with what the press says? There is no \nbody more critical in this whole country of the press than the people \nin this very room, and me included along with them. We do not like some \nof the things that happen in the press.\n  Do we want to open even a tiny, tiny, tiny chance that they might \nrestrict our ability to assemble peaceably? And do we want to take a \ntiny chance that we would not be able to petition our Government for \nredress of grievances? Those are the things that are covered in that \nfirst amendment, known as the Bill of Rights, along with the other \namendments that were incorporated before the Constitution was signed, \nbefore it even came into being.\n  I think there is only one way to weaken the fabric of our country, \nour unique country, our country that stands as a beacon before other \nnations around this world. You know when you think about someone \nburning the flag, I truly do feel sorry for them. I honestly do. My \ninitial gut reaction would be to stomp them, go after them, get them, \nstop the burning, and so on. It would be a natural reaction that so \nmany people would have as well. I know all the ones that visited my \noffice yesterday, I would not have to ask them to do that same thing.\n  But that would be one way of showing our unhappiness with these few \nmisguided souls. At the same time we would be taking action against \nthem, I truly would feel sorry for them. Have they never known the \nfeeling inside of looking at that flag and being proud? Have they never \nbeen able to apparently work in any way for their country or the \nmilitary in war or peace, either one, in which they were called to take \naction for a purpose bigger than themselves?\n  I say this morning that is one of the most exhilarating things that \ncan ever happen to a man or woman, to be able to represent their \ncountry and be called to something, to a purpose bigger than \nthemselves. I feel sorry for people who have never had that experience. \nIt is something you cannot really explain.\n  We had a parade once I was involved in down on Pennsylvania Avenue \nand I addressed a joint meeting of Congress down at the other end of \nthe Capitol, and everybody was waving flags out there. Everybody was \nwaving flags. My comment when I opened down there, I said it just meant \nso much to me to see all the flags waving coming down Pennsylvania \nAvenue. It made a hard-to-define feeling within that I could not really \ndescribe in words, but I hope that we never lose that hard-to-define \nfeeling as a nation, as individuals and a nation. We would be a lesser \ncountry if we lost that exhilaration, that feeling of pride when we see \na flag and see it displayed and see people's excitement.\n  But I feel sorry for those people who have never known that feeling. \nI truly do. There would not be any problem with people burning the flag \nif everyone had that individual experience. But it is by retreating \nfrom the principles that the flag stands for--``principles'' underlined \n16 times--principles that this flag stands for, that if we retreat from \nthose principles, that will do more damage to the fabric of our Nation \nthan 1,000 torched flags ever could do.\n  The first amendment--I read it a moment ago--says simply and clearly: \n``Congress shall make no law * * * abridging the freedom of speech''--\nfreedom of speech. For 200 years, in good times and bad, in times of \nharmony and times of strife, we have held those words to mean exactly \nwhat they say. That ``Congress shall make no law''--no law--that will \nin any way cut back on that freedom of speech, meaning freedom of \nexpression, as the Supreme Court has said. \n\n[[Page S 18278]]\n\n\n  And now, ostensibly to prohibit something that very rarely happens \nanyway, we are asked to alter those first amendment words to mean that \nCongress may make some laws--little ones--some laws restricting freedom \nof expression.\n  I know the other side says, ``Well, what we're doing is putting this \nback to the States.'' They want us to just put it back to the States \nand let the States decide this. I do not care for that approach.\n  Let me tell you, we are one Nation, one Nation under God, \nindivisible. It does not say we are going to split things up and we \nwill treat our flag differently and the Constitution will only apply \nhere, the Bill of Rights only applies one way in one State and a \ndifferent way in another State. I do not agree with that.\n  So I do not want to see us make some laws, even tiny laws, even the \npotential of a tiny little crack in that Bill of Rights that would \nrestrict freedom of expression. I agree with, I believe the man's name \nis Warner. He is a lawyer here in town. He was in the Marine Corps and \nprisoner of war. One of his captors brought to him a picture of a flag \nburning in this country and said, ``There, that shows what the people \nthink; that shows that it is no good. See this.''\n  He said, ``That is what freedom is all about. That is what expression \nis all about,'' or words to that effect. I did not bring his exact \nwords here. He said he was proud of it, and it completely crushed his \ncaptor. The fellow did not know how to react to that.\n  Yet, he was right. We can say that this time this law might be about \nflag burning. The next form of political expression that we might seek \nto prohibit would be in the religion area. There are lots of religions \ntoday. Splinter groups I do not agree with at all and, I would say, \n99.99 percent of the people of the country would not agree with them at \nall. But do we make any restriction on how they can practice their \nreligion? No.\n  I do not like a lot of things the press writes today, but do we make \nany tiny little restriction on the press to pull back on what they can \ndo? Or assemble or petition the Government, the other things that are \ncovered in that first amendment.\n  So we can say this time the laws would be about flag burning or flag \ndesecration, to use the exact words. But what will the next form of \npolitical expression be that we seek to prohibit, if we start a crack \nthat has not occurred, not in the 200-plus year's history of this \ncountry?\n  I do not think there is necessarily a slippery slope out there that \nif we make this little crack here that everything is going to go \ndownhill from there and away we go and we are going to see freedom of \nspeech restricted, everything else and we do not know where that slide \nwill end. I do not think that will happen, but do we want to take a \nchance that any misguided group of people in the future would even \nthink about going to that end? And for what? For a threat that, at \nleast in current years, is practically nonexistent?\n  I had been told there was not a single flag burning this year. I was \ncorrected yesterday, and the people visiting me said they believe there \nwere three they had documented this year. That is one per approximately \n90 million people in this country. We are about 260 million, close to \n270 million. Even if those are true, and I do not question it. The \ngentleman who told me seemed to know what he was talking about, so I \naccept his version of this. But we are talking about one incident out \nof 90 million people. So I find it a little difficult to think that \nthis is a very major problem at the moment.\n  But some will ask, is not desecrating the flag obnoxious, abhorrent \nand offensive to most, and yet it is within our right? You bet. I find \nit just as obnoxious and abhorrent as any person possibly can, but I \ntry to look beyond that.\n  I said before, if I was present when somebody started to burn a flag \nright there, I have no doubt whatsoever I would join the many others \nhere, and the galleries, who would take whatever action to stop it, \nphysical or however we had to do it.\n  But then you have to think beyond this. Do we want to change the \nConstitution of the United States and take even a chance of something \nthat is 1-in-a-90 million shot of our citizens doing something like \nthis, if that is the number from this year?\n  Of course, desecrating the flag is offensive. It is offensive to the \nvast majority of Americans. Almost everybody. But that is precisely the \nreason we have a first amendment, to protect the kinds of political \nexpression that are offensive and out of step with majority opinion in \nthis Nation.\n  The majority opinion said that we should not have civil rights in \ncertain parts of this country. We went ahead with it. That was a much \nmore pervasive problem than this is. But you do not need a first \namendment to protect the expression of political views with which \neveryone else agrees. That is not what we need the first amendment for.\n  You need the first amendment to protect minority points of view that \nthe vast majority of people disagree with. That is what the protection \nis all about, and that is what sets this country of ours completely \napart from any other nation in the world.\n  So I think we have to get beyond just the visceral gut reaction of \nsomeone burning a flag and think beyond that as to what the \nimplications are if we take action against those poor, misguided souls \nthat I truly do feel sorry for, for reasons I spoke about a moment ago. \nThey deserve to be protected. I may not like it, but they deserve to \nhave their rights protected as much as I deserve to have my rights \nprotected.\n  So the amendment is to protect minority points of view with which the \nvast majority of people disagree. Protecting the minority viewpoints \nagainst the tyranny of the majority is exactly the point of the first \namendment and why the Founders only agreed to approve the Constitution \nwith the understanding that it was to be included.\n  It has often been said it is possible to detect how free a society is \nby the degree to which it is willing to tolerate and permit the \nexpression of ideas that are odious and reprehensible to the values of \nthat society. You and I and a majority of our fellow citizens find flag \nburning and desecration to be vile and disgusting. But we also find \nNazis marching in Skokie, IL, or the Ku Klux Klan marching and burning \ncrosses in Selma, AL, to be vile and disgusting. But if the first \namendment means anything at all, it means that those cruel and poor \nmisguided souls, many of them I think demented, have a right to express \nthemselves in that manner, however objectionable the rest of us may \nfind their message.\n  But what about the argument that the first amendment is not and has \nnever been absolute, that we already have restrictions on freedoms of \nexpression and that a prohibition on flag burning would simply be one \nmore? After all, it said freedom of speech does not extend to slander, \nlibel, revealing military secrets or yelling ``fire'' in a crowded \ntheater. That is true. To the extent that flag burning would incite \nothers to violence in response does not constitute a clear and present \ndanger, and that is what the Supreme Court has said in their language. \nThat is their language. The difference here is whether it is a clear \nand present danger that we have every right to try to avert.\n  But this argument misses a key distinction, and that distinction is \nthat all those restrictions on free speech I just mentioned threaten \nreal and specific harm to other people, harm that would come about \nbecause of what the speaker said, not because of what the listeners \ndid.\n  To say that we should restrict speech or expression that would \noutrage a majority of listeners or move them to violence is to say that \nwe will tolerate only those kinds of expression that the majority \nagrees with, or at least does not disagree with too much. That would do \nnothing less than gut the first amendment.\n\n  What about the argument that flag desecration is an act and is not a \nform of speech or expression that is protected by the first amendment? \nWell, I think that argument is a bit specious. Anybody burning a flag \nin protest is clearly saying something. They are making a statement by \ntheir body language, and what they are doing makes a statement that \nmaybe speaks far, far louder than the words they may be willing to \nutter on such an occasion.\n  They are saying something, just the same way as people who picket, or \n\n\n[[Page S 18279]]\nmarch in protest, or use other forms of symbolic speech are expressing \nthemselves. Indeed, if we did not view flag burners as something we \nfind offensive and repugnant, we surely would not be debating their \nright to do so.\n  Let me say a word about something that has gotten short shrift in \nthis debate, something we should consider very carefully before voting \non this amendment. I am talking about the practical problems with this \namendment. Let us say we pass it, the States pass it, it becomes an \namendment, and we change the Constitution. Then what a nightmare we \nwould have enforcing it.\n  First off, we are going to have 50 different interpretations. There \nis not going to be just one Nation on the Constitution or on the Bill \nof Rights anymore. There are going to be 50 little interpretations of \nwhat is in that Bill of Rights. I do not want to see that happen.\n  But if Congress and States are allowed to prohibit the physical \ndesecration of the flag, how precisely are we defining the flag? We do \nnot have an official flag, as such, with an exact size, type, kind of \nink, dyes, fabric, and the whole works. There is no official flag, as \nsuch. So does this amendment refer to only manufactured flags of cloth \nor nylon of a certain size or description, such as the ones we fly over \nthe Capitol here and send out? I send out dozens of those every year, \nand I am very proud to do it. There is no official flag, so what size \nare we talking about? Does it refer to the small paper flags on a stick \nwe hand out to children at political rallies or stick in a cupcake at a \nbanquet? Those flags are often tossed on the floor or in a garbage can \nat conclusion of an event. I really do not know. I am asking these \nquestions here.\n  How about back in 1976 when we had the bicentennial? At that time, \nthey were selling flag bikini swimsuits for women and boxer shorts for \nmen. I remember seeing a rock concert one day, and at that time it was \nan abhorrent thing to me. The guy is strumming away on his guitar, and \nall at once he takes his pants off on the stage on that great occasion \nbecause he had flag shorts on underneath. How about bikinis? Should we \npermit flags to be worn as bikinis? We know they get soiled once in a \nwhile, too. Think of that. I do not want to use all these improper \nwords in the Senate Chamber, but do we want someone possibly urinating \non the flag of the United States, worn as shorts or a bikini? I do not. \nI find that abhorrent. But are we going to restrict that? I probably \nwould like to restrict that, I can tell you.\n  How are we going to define this as to what happens? How about the guy \nwho jogs down the street with a flag T-shirt on and becomes drenched \nwith sweat? I do not like that, but is it desecration? He is probably \nproud that he is wearing the flag.\n  How about a guy that has an old flag with grease all over it, and he \nwants to destroy it. You are supposed to burn it to destroy a flag. So \nhe holds it up and he is going to burn it and then he says at the same \ntime, ``I am doing this because I do not like the tax bill they passed \nlast year, and I am doing it in protest. I am burning the flag because \nI do not like what they did in Washington.'' Are we going to lock him \nup? Remember, the proper way to destroy a flag that is old or has \nbecome soiled is to burn it. But what if he does it in protest? What \nwas his intent? Every lawyer will tell you that the toughest thing to \nprove is intent.\n  We could go through example after example after example. We have a \npostage stamp now that has a flag on it. I was proud when they did \nthat. I wrote a letter complimenting the Postmaster General for that, \nputting that on every piece of mail going out through the country, to \nremind people that we have a flag of the United States that stands for \nsomething; it stands for principles. What if you take a postage stamp \nflag and put a match under that thing and it burns up and you say, \n``There,'' and you stomp on it? Can you be arrested under the new \nlegislation?\n  I do not know what the courts would do in a case like that. We can go \non with all kinds of examples here of how this would be very difficult \nto administer, and it would be subject to 50 different interpretations. \nI might be able to do something in Ohio, and I drive across the Ohio \nRiver to Kentucky, West Virginia, or Pennsylvania and the same thing \nmight be illegal. I could be arrested for doing something across the \nriver, if we are going to have 50 different State interpretations along \nthis line.\n  So I come to the floor today to say that I think--and I regret having \nto feel that this amendment should and must be defeated, but I really \nfeel that the dangers from it far outweigh the threat that we have to \nthe flag from those 1 in 90 million, if the figures are correct, \nAmericans that have burned a flag in protest this year, as I was told \nyesterday. I had been told there were no examples this year, but it was \ncorrected, and I was told there were three certified examples of flag \nburning. That means 1 for every 90 million Americans.\n  Is this something we need to correct as a major problem for this \ncountry with an amendment to the Constitution of the United States of \nAmerica, which guarantees the freedom of speech and of expression in \nthe Bill of Rights? It was not going to be signed by the States unless \nthat was included. They felt that strongly about protecting the freedom \nof people to express themselves.\n  I think history and future generations alike will judge us harshly, \nas they should, if we permit people who would defile our flag--or \nwhatever disrespect they pay to the flag, whether they were stomping on \nit, or burning it, or using it as clothing, or whatever--I think future \ngenerations will think that they defiled our flag, but we do not want \nto let them hoodwink us into also defiling our Constitution, no matter \nhow onerous their acts may be. It would be a hollow victory, it seems \nto me. We must not let those who revile our freedoms and our way of \nlife trick us into diminishing them, or even take a chance of \ndiminishing them.\n  Mr. President, I do not think we can let the passions of the moment \nstampede us into abandoning principles for all time. My gut reaction is \nthat if there was a flag burning or desecration here, or somebody \nshowed disrespect for the flag, it would be the same for the Presiding \nOfficer and everyone in this Chamber and all those in the gallery \nhere--we would probably take our own physical action to stop it right \nhere and now. But then we had better think about, before we take \naction, what that Bill of Rights means and how precious it is. In all \n200 years, we have never made a single change to it.\n  This Nation was not founded until that provision was included in the \nConstitution. They would not sign it unless that first amendment was \nincluded. If we are going to continue to be the land of the free and \nthe home of the brave, I think we had better be very, very careful. We \npledge allegiance to the flag, and that is not an official Government \ndocument. Something came up and it became adopted as sort of a pledge \nof allegiance. We say, ``I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United \nStates of America, and to the Republic for which it stands,'' and we \nreel that off sometimes at a dinner, while we are looking at our steak \nand waiting for the dinner to get started, and we think, Well, OK, and \nwe sort of reel those words off and do not think about them. The rest \nof that pledge we should think about. I think it does tie in with this.\n\n  Then we say those words ``one nation.'' We pledge that we will be one \nnation. These are the principles our flag stands for--one nation. We \nare going to stand before the rest of the world not as North and South, \nEast and West, black and white, Republican or Democrat. We will be one \nnation before the rest of this world, and every single person is \nimportant, and we will be in every part of this country, and we will be \none nation, a nation of might, a nation of resolve. One nation--not \nsplit up with 50 interpretations of the Constitution, 50 \ninterpretations of the Bill of Rights for different parts of the \ncountry.\n  The next words are truly unique. I have traveled all over the world \nand looked at government documents all over this world and never seen \nthe next two words anywhere--``under God.'' We say, whether we are \nProtestant, Catholic, Jewish, Moslem, Buddhist, Baptist, Presbyterian--\nas I am--or whatever you are, we recognize there is a higher power than \nall of us. If we just pray and listen a little bit--listen a little \nbit--maybe we will get enough guidance about how to go about helping \nthis country in the future. \n\n[[Page S 18280]]\n\n  It is under God; not just under getting money, not just under the \ngreed of power, not just under a single standard of enforced religious \nbeliefs which are also covered in that very first amendment of the \nConstitution. Our religious beliefs are not to be imposed by those that \nthink that they, and only they, know and hold the truth. We sure have \nenough of those around these days. ``Under God.'' Pray a little, listen \na little, and maybe we will get some guidance.\n  Then we say ``indivisible.'' Not rich against poor, young against \nold, workers against owners, but indivisible. We stand before the rest \nof this world as an indivisible nation.\n  Then we say words which I have not found anywhere else in the world, \nsix almost magic words--``with liberty and justice for all.'' ``For \nall''--underline that in our discussion today--``for all.''\n  Liberty of what? Of course, liberty of opportunity. Sure, we want to \nsee everyone have an opportunity. We want everyone to get a good \neducation. We want much to have a fair shot at a good job and all the \nother things that we know about.\n  It is not just for a favored few. It is not just for the rich and the \nwealthy and the land owners. It is for everyone in this country. And \nthe protections are for everyone in this country. It is not just for \nthose born to power and privilege.\n  That first amendment talks of this. It says we will be free in our \nreligion; we will be free in our speech, including ``expression'' which \nwe are talking about today; we will be free in our assembly; and we \nwill be free in redress of our Government. ``With liberty and justice \nfor all''--liberty of opportunity and liberty of expression of those \nfreedoms without any question for every single person--for all.\n  Then we say ``and justice for all.'' That means equality. We are all \nequal, whether you are President of the United States or you are \noutside digging a ditch, you have the same protections, the same rights \nas any other person in this country. It does not say ``except'' in the \ncase where there are 90 million and one goes astray we will penalize \nthat guy and lock him out. It does not say that.\n  I think that is a dream for which America still strives. We do not \nhave a perfect society, not by a long shot. We have a long way to go, \nwhether we are talking about civil rights or economic fairness in our \ncountry or the rights of every kid to get a decent education. We have \nso far to go.\n  I am so proud of this country for addressing these problems. We are \nwilling to stand up and address them and do it in an open forum. We do \nit every day here on the Senate floor. Where else in the world are \npeople so concerned about the rights of every single individual in \ntheir nation--nowhere else in this world.\n  Take the pledge. ``I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United \nStates of America, one nation''--we will keep it one nation, under God. \nYou bet. That is something unique in this country. We say there is a \nhigher power, whatever our approach to that throne of grace may be. \n``Indivisible''--we will not do things that tear our Nation apart and \nmake us live under different rules. We will live under the same rules \nas much as we can. ``And with liberty and justice for all''--the \nliberty of opportunity, the liberty of sameness, how we are treated by \nour Government, and the justice of equality.\n  Thank God for our country. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Grams). The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, first let me commend our colleague \nfrom Ohio. Few have a better right to discuss issues affecting \nattitudes about our Nation than Senator John Glenn.\n  His history has been one of service in so many areas--as a pilot, as \nan astronaut, as a Senator. Now I know John Glenn very well. One area \nhe is not so good in, we have gone skiing together, he is not very good \nthere, but in matters of profession and decency and honor few have the \ncredentials that John Glenn has. I am delighted to hear his comments. I \nshare the views of my friend and colleague.\n\n  Mr. President, this is a tough issue. It is tough because people of \ngood will on both sides feel so differently about the issue. The \nveterans organizations that I belong to are very much supportive of \ntaking good care of the flag, of not permitting the desecration, if \nthat is possible.\n  I am a life member of the VFW. I served overseas, World War II, and \nyet we come up with the kind of disagreements on this matter that we \nhave. I regret it.\n  I respect all the colleagues with whom there may be a difference in \npoint of view--those who think we need an amendment. I disagree with \nthe decision they made but I never questioned their patriotism nor do I \nexpect them to question mine or Senator Glenn or Senator Kerrey or \nothers who have served in uniform. Others need not have served in \nuniform to have a point view that has to be listened to and perhaps \nrespected.\n  I want to express my strong support, Mr. President, to the flag of \nthe United States and my outrage at those who would desecrate the flag \nin any way. At the same time, I rise to express my deep concern about \namending the U.S. Constitution and the Bill of Rights.\n  I am not a lawyer, Mr. President, but as a private citizen and as a \nSenator I have always been vigilant about restrictions on the basic \nfreedoms that make America unique in the world. Perhaps because I am \nthe son of immigrant parents whose families fled tyranny for the \npromise of freedom, the Constitution and the Bill of Rights for me are \nnot abstractions. I was raised to respect them as a sacred promise of \nfreedom. Promises compelling enough to convince my grandparents as they \ncarried my parents to travel halfway across the Earth to live under the \nprotections of the Bill of Rights and the Constitution. They are \nprotections that have drawn millions to our shores.\n\n  I remember my dear grandmother, who was born in Russia--my mother was \nabout a year old when she was brought here--talking about what a great \ncountry this is. With a thick accent she said, ``In this house''--it is \nfunny, she drew her patriotic commitment along verbal lines--she said, \nwith the heaviest accent you can imagine, ``In this house we speak only \nEnglish.'' It was quite remarkable. It left an impression on me that \nhas lasted all my life.\n  This country has been so good to me and my family, beyond my wildest \nboyhood dreams; even more important, beyond my mother's most precious \ndreams. It has been that way for millions of us, and for that reason I \nvolunteered to do my part in World War II. For that reason, although \nthe private sector was a very comfortable arena for me, I sought public \noffice as a U.S. Senator. I wanted to do whatever I could to give \nsomething back to our country, our country which continues to serve as \na beacon of hope for millions seeking freedom and a better life around \nthe world.\n  One of the reasons I left the private sector to come here was I \nwanted to leave my children, and now my grandchildren, an inheritance \nthat went far beyond the value of money and other assets, and that is a \nstrong America, an America where all people could enjoy their freedom \nas long as they did not encroach upon others. That is the way I feel \nabout our Nation. That is the way I feel about the symbol of our flag.\n  For that reason, just as I revere the Constitution and the Bill of \nRights, I love the flag, which we at my home fly regularly, which \nembodies our ideals, our liberties, our history and our sacrifices. In \nthat, I know I stand virtually with all Americans.\n  In my mind, I contrast those patriotic Americans with the image of \nthe flag burner, whether on our shores or anyplace else; pictures on \nthe front pages of the paper, having our flag burned by some in Bosnia. \nIt angers me. We are not there to hurt. We are there to help. But the \nthousands of patriotic Americans I know, who have been touched by the \ntragedy of war or sacrifice for this country, are shocked and angered \nby the view, the image of someone destroying the flag, burning the \nflag. They are showing their contempt for this incredible Nation in \nwhich we live.\n  The flag is a unique national symbol. I have a special, personal \naffection for it, as I said, along with all Americans. It is the one \ngreat symbol that unites our Nation. The flag represents more than 200 \nyears of our history and our culture.\n  As a veteran, as a Senator, and as an American, son of immigrants, \nthe flag \n\n[[Page S 18281]]\nrepresents noble things to me. And flag burning is an ugly, despicable, \nand cowardly act. When I have seen it, though I have not seen it \ndirectly--when I have seen pictures of it, it sickens me and it saddens \nme. Those who burn the flag are ingrates. They lack the courage and the \ncharacter to fight for change through a well-established and fair and \njust process. Instead, their mission is different. They want to \ninfuriate and enrage and offend, more than they want to achieve their \ngoals through their attacks on this precious symbol. They are misguided \nand they deserve the contempt of all of us.\n  But I am not prepared to sacrifice the principle of freedom of \nexpression embodied in the first amendment to protect a symbol. I worry \nabout compromising the Bill of Rights. I am unwilling to risk, for the \nfirst time in our history, narrowing the freedoms expressed in the \nfirst amendment. Desecration of our flag is outrageous and my anger at \nsuch incidents wants me to seek vengeance, to strike back and to punish \nthose who commit these acts.\n\n  However, when I think about how this offensive dissent might be \nchoked off, I conclude that in the process we run the terrible risk of \ntrampling on a fundamental right of our democracy, the right to \ndisagree, the right to speak out freely, to exercise dissent no matter \nhow disagreeable.\n  There is no right more fundamental to our democracy than the right of \nfree speech, the right to assemble, the right to express ourselves on \nthe issues of importance as citizens. That is why the first step of a \ndespot is to squelch free speech. Silence the people and you cut the \nthroat of democracy.\n  Our first amendment protects everyone's right to speak out. It is the \ncitizen's shield against tyranny. It is what makes America special. It \nis what makes America a model for those aspiring to freedom around the \nworld.\n  The right of the individual American to be free is the right to do \nwhat one wishes short of violating the rights of others, and that \nincludes the right to do or say what is popular, certainly--but it also \nincludes the right to do or say the unpopular. For it is then, when \nactions give offense, that our freedom is put to the test. It is then, \nprecisely then, that we learn whether or not we are free.\n  To defend the right to freedom of speech, freedom of expression, is \nquite different from defending the speech that flows from the exercise \nof that right. It is perfectly consistent to condemn flag burning, as \nmost Americans do, while defending the right, as unpleasant as it is, \nfor someone to abuse it. The flag is a symbol of our freedom. \nDesecrating it is offensive because it desecrates every one of us. But \nwhat would be even more offensive than the desecration of the symbol \nwould be the desecration of the principle that it symbolizes. In the \nend, symbols are only symbols. If we desecrate the real thing, the \nprinciples our founders fought so hard to secure and that so many since \nhave sacrificed their lives to preserve, we will lose something far \nmore valuable, far more difficult to restore.\n  I have heard it argued that flag burning is not speech but rather \nconduct, and thus is not protected by the first amendment. But that \nargument reflects a misunderstanding of the first amendment. All \nspeech, in a sense, is conduct. When one vocalizes, or uses a printing \npress, or types into a computer, that is conduct. But it is generally \nprotected conduct if it expresses a political idea. Flag burning is \ndespicable precisely because it expresses a despicable political idea.\n  Flag burning insults the United States of America. It insults the \ngreatest Nation on the face of the Earth. And that is a disgusting \nidea. Just about every American is outraged by that idea. But the whole \npoint of the first amendment is to protect the expression of ideas, no \nmatter how despicable.\n  Throughout the history of our Nation, we have never banned the \nexpression of an idea solely because others have found it offensive; \nnever. We have never sanctioned speech that hurts others, like yelling \n``fire'' in a crowded theater. But we have never banned speech just \nbecause it made others uncomfortable. And I feel that this amendment \nwould do just that for the first time. This is a very, very dangerous \nprecedent, as we heard from Senator Glenn a few minutes ago. A little \nopening often transfers into a giant hole.\n  Once we ban one idea because it offends some people, other ideas will \nbe threatened as well. Where do you draw the line? It is a dangerous \nand slippery slope, and ultimately can lead to tyranny.\n  No doubt, those who are proposing this constitutional amendment are \nentirely well meaning, but I am reminded of something that the great \nSupreme Court Justice Louis Brandeis said. He said, ``The greatest \ndangers to liberty lurk in insidious encroachment by men of zeal, well \nmeaning, but without understanding.''\n  By no means do I intend to suggest that those who feel differently on \nthis amendment are without understanding. But I think this expression, \nthis sense, embraces the concerns that we have to have, that our \ngreatest danger to liberty often lies within our society.\n  I would add, Mr. President, that if freedom is lost, it is most \nlikely to be lost not in some cataclysmic war. Americans are too \npatriotic, too willing, too dedicated a country for that to happen. It \nis most likely to be lost a word at a time, a phrase at a time, a \nsentence at a time, an amendment at a time. We saw that happen in one \nof the great--formerly great--nations of the world before World War II \nin Germany. One of the first things they did was start to ban speech, \nban expression, and the rest is one of man's darkest hours, or periods, \nin history.\n  Mr. President, I think it is dangerous to tinker with the Bill of \nRights, and especially with the first amendment.\n  I hope my colleagues will stand by the first amendment and support \nour laws for the flag by working to make our democracy even stronger.\n  Thank you. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. HATCH addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I have listened to the various speeches \npresented today about the flag amendment. There are people on both \nsides who speak on this issue with sincerity. For the life of me, I \nhave a rough time understanding some of these arguments. People come to \nthe floor and say that they want to protect the flag, that they love \nthe flag, and that they are patriotic. I do not question that.\n  All that this amendment says is that Congress has the power to \nprohibit flag desecration. Everybody knows Congress is going to want to \npass a statute once the amendment passes. It will be done reasonably.\n  With regard to the first amendment, let me point out that this is not \nan amendment to the first amendment. The flag amendment is the \ncorrection of a faulty Supreme Court decision. Chief Justice Warren, \nJustice Black--first amendment absolutists--Justice Fortas, Justice \nStevens, just to mention four liberal Justices, have said that \nprohibiting flag desecration does not violate the first amendment.\n  Let me just respond to those people who think that free speech is an \nabsolute, that you can never violate it, that you can never do anything \nat all to regulate it. First of all, the protection for free speech \ndoes not apply to flag burning. Flag burning is conduct. How can \nanybody say it is speech when in fact it is an act? But let us assume \nfor the sake of argument that it is speech. Let me just list 20 types \nof speech that are not protected by the first amendment, because people \ndo not realize that there is a lot of speech not protected by the first \namendment. Society has chosen not to protect these types of expression. \nThe Supreme Court chooses not to do so.\n  Let me cite ``fighting words.'' In Chaplinsky versus New Hampshire, a \n1942 case, the Court said that fighting words can be banned.\n  Second, in the 1969 case of Brandenberg versus Ohio, a very important \ncase, as was Chaplinsky, the Court said that speech that incites \nimminent violence was not protected by the First Amendment.\n  Third, libel is not protected by the first amendment, see New York \nTimes versus Sullivan, 1964.\n  Fourth, defamation Beauharnais versus Illinois, a 1952 case.\n  Fifth, obscenity is not protected by the first amendment. See Miller \nversus California, a 1973 case.\n  Sixth, speech that constitutes fraud, conspiracy, or aiding and \nabetting is not protected by the first amendment. \n\n[[Page S 18282]]\n\n  The first amendment is not absolute. There is a lot of speech that is \nnot protected by the first amendment.\n  Seventh, commercial speech in certain situations is not protected, \nsee Central Hudson Gas & Electric versus Public Service Commission, a \n1980 case.\n  Eighth, political contributions are not protected by the first \namendment under certain circumstances, see Buckley versus Valeo.\n  Ninth, child pornography is not protected by the first amendment. \nThat is the case of New York versus Ferber.\n  Tenth, political speech of Government employees in certain situations \nis not protected by the first amendment--Pickering versus Board of \nEducation, a 1968 case.\n  How about speech interfering with elections? That is No. 11. See \nBurson versus Freeman, 1992 case.\n  These are all cases where we have content-based restrictions on the \nfirst amendment.\n  So people come out here and claim: ``My goodness. We cannot amend the \nfirst amendment.''\n  All of these cases have limited the reach of the first amendment, and \nrightly so.\n  Who wants to allow fighting words? Who wants to allow words that \nincite people to violence? Who wants to approve or uphold libel that \ndestroys people's reputations? Who wants to approve defamation? Who \nwants to allow obscenity in this society, true obscenity, that is so \nfoul that the community standards decry it? Who wants to uphold speech \nthat constitutes fraud, conspiracy or aiding and abetting? Who wants to \nuse commercial speech that is improper? How about political \ncontributions? How about child pornography?\n  Under current law, the government may regulate these types of speech \nwithout violating the first amendment. Naturally, all of these are \nareas where the Court, or the law, has said that the first amendment \ndoes not provide an absolute protection.\n  Let me provide my colleagues with some reasonable time, place, and \nmanner restrictions on expression.\n  Twelfth, this is the 12th illustration--is restrictions on when \nGovernment property, such as national parks, can be used. That is Clark \nversus Community for Creative Nonviolence, a 1984 case.\n  Thirteenth, picketing in front of a home--that is Frisby versus \nShultz, a 1988 case.\n  Fourteenth, posters on street posts--Members of the City Council of \nLos Angeles versus Taxpayers for Vincent, a 1984 case.\n  Fifteenth, restrictions on speech in prison--the court has held in \nTurner versus Safley, a 1987 case that restrictions can be imposed on \nspeech in prisons.\n  Sixteenth, regulation of speech in schools--that is the Hazelwood \nSchool District versus Kuhlmeier, a 1988 case.\n  Seventeenth, the use of soundtrucks and loudspeakers--that is speech. \nBut it can be regulated under the Supreme Court's decision in Kovaks \nversus Cooper, a 1949 case.\n  Eighteenth, zoning of adult movie theaters--that is a matter of \nspeech, but see Young versus American Mini Theaters, a 1976 case.\n  Certain speech in airports has been banned.\n  Restrictions on door-to-door solicitation--that is Schneider versus \nState, a 1939 case.\n  And, finally, the 21st illustration I will give--and then I will \nstop--administrative fees and permits for parades. That is Cox versus \nNew Hampshire, a 1941 case.\n  These are all limitations on speech under the first amendment. So I \nfind it hard to understand the other side's arguments that we are going \nto interfere with the first amendment's rights and privileges and that \nwe will be amending the first amendment. All 21 of these examples are \ncertainly exceptions to free speech, and I am sure that the Supreme \nCourt has recognized others.\n  So this is not something that is unique or new. We are talking about \nthe flag of the United States, the national symbol. Some people claim: \n``Oh, my goodness. The rights of free speech supersede everything.'' \nWell, they do not. And especially where speech is not involved. But why \ncan we not ban in the interest of patriotism and honor and values in \nthis country, despicable, rotten, dirty, conduct against our national \nsymbol?\n  It amazes me that these folks come in here and say how they support \nthe flag, how wonderful it is, and how terrible it is for people to do \nthese awful things--to smear the flag with excrement, to urinate on it, \nto tramp on it, to burn it. What do we stand for around here? Have we \ngotten so bad in this country that no values count?\n  I know people are going to vote for this amendment because they are \ntired of the lack of values in our country. They are tired of people \njust making excuses for all kinds of offensive conduct in this country. \nHave we no standards at all? Do we have to tolerate every rotten, \ndespicable action that people take just because we are free people? The \nanswer to that is no, no, no.\n  I am willing to admit my colleagues are sincere. Bless them for it. \nBut they are sincerely wrong to treat the flag like this while they say \nthey uphold it and honor and love it, and yet they will not vote for a \nsimple amendment that gives Congress the power to say what desecration \nof the flag really is.\n  That is all it does. Congress does not even have to act if this \namendment is passed. But we all know it will. Congress will act.\n  Let me just talk a little bit about the McConnell amendment.\n  Mr. President, make no mistake about it, Senator McConnell and I are \nthe best of friends, but this McConnell amendment absolutely would kill \nthis flag protection amendment. The McConnell amendment is a killer \namendment, and I think everybody knows that.\n  It replaces the flag protection amendment with a statute which cannot \nwithstand Supreme Court review after Johnson and Eichman, and is far \ntoo narrow to offer real protection for the flag in any event.\n  The American Legion and the Citizens Flag Alliance are strongly \nopposed to the McConnell proposal.\n  Any Senator who has cosponsored Senate Joint Resolution 31, the flag \nprotection amendment, or stated his or her intention to vote for it, \nmust vote against the McConnell amendment. You cannot be for the flag \namendment and the McConnell statute as proposed, which will completely \nreplace the flag amendment.\n  Mr. President, I appreciate the desire of the Senator from Kentucky \nto do something to protect the American flag. I know he feels strongly \nabout the flag. I think that is true about everybody in this body. \nRightly or wrongly, they feel strongly. And I hope that, in the end, my \nfriend from Kentucky, will see his way clear to supporting our \nconstitutional amendment should his amendment fail.\n  But I say to my friend from Kentucky, with great respect, we have \nbeen down the statutory road before on this issue. It is a dead end, \nplain and simple.\n  I well recall my friend from Delaware, Senator Biden lining up a \nvariety of constitutional scholars to support his statute in 1989. \nSenator Dole, Senator Grassley, and I, told the Senate that the Supreme \nCourt would strike it down. The statute passed by a vote of something \nlike 91 to 9. Sure enough, the Supreme Court took 30 days after oral \nargument and less than eight dismissive pages to throw it out in United \nStates versus Eichman. I say with all respect, the Senator from \nKentucky now invites the Senate down the same barren path.\n  The Supreme Court, in its Johnson and Eichman decisions, has made its \nposition crystal clear: Special legal protections for the American flag \noffends the Court's concept of free speech.\n  In Johnson, the Court made clear that for a State to forbid flag \nburning whenever such a prohibition protects the flag's symbolic role, \nbut allow such burning when it promotes that role, as by ceremoniously \nburning a dirty flag, is totally unacceptable. The Court says this \nallows the flag to be used as a symbol in only one direction.\n\n  Similarly, if flag desecration is singled out for greater punishment \nthan other breaches of the peace or incitements to violence, such \nspecial treatment promotes the flag's symbolic role. This, sadly, the \nCourt will not tolerate--they have told us this twice, now.\n  In Eichman, the Court clearly declared that no statute which protects \n\n\n[[Page S 18283]]\nthe flag as a symbol would survive constitutional muster. The Flag \nProtection Act was held invalid, like the Texas statute in Johnson, \nbecause of the ``same fundamental flaw: [they both] suppress expression \nout of concern for [its] likely communicative impact.'' [496 U.S. at \n317]. Even though Congress had attempted to write a broader statute to \navoid the problems of the Texas law, by making all physical impairments \nillegal except for ceremonial disposal of a worn flag, the Court found \nthe act unconstitutional anyway because ``its restriction on expression \ncannot be justified without reference to the content of the regulated \nspeech.'' [Id. at 318]. As Prof. Richard Parker of Harvard University \nLaw School has put it, the Supreme Court found the act invalid because \nit ``involves taking sides in favor of what is `uniquely' symbolized by \nthe flag--our `aspiration to national unity.' ''\n  Indeed, my friend from Kentucky, has made very clear in his remarks \nupon introducing the bill what this bill is all about--it is not about \nbreaches of the peace or theft. It is about protecting the flag as a \nsymbol. He said on October 19, 1995:\n\n       Flag burning is a despicable act. And we should have zero \n     tolerance for those who deface our flag . . . I am disgusted \n     by those who desecrate our symbol of freedom. . . .\n\n  Mr. President, those words reinforce the bill's fundamental conflict \nwith Johnson and Eichman. So does the finding in the proposed statue \nwhich describes our flag as:\n\n       a unique symbol of national unity and represents the values \n     of liberty, justice, and equality that make this Nation an \n     example of freedom unmatched throughout the world.\n\n  But many who burn the flag disagree with every word of that finding. \nSome of them believe the flag represents oppression, exploitation, and \nracism. They are wrong, but the Supreme Court has made clear that \nCongress and the States cannot protect the flag in order to preserve \nits symbolic value in one direction. I believe the Supreme Court is no \nmore correct than it was in Dred Scott and Plessy versus Ferguson, but \nwe cannot overrule such errors by statute.\n  While it is true that flag desecration can be penalized pursuant to a \ngeneral breach of the peace statute, in the same way other breaches of \nthe peace are punished, offering special protection for the flag is \nintended to enhance the flag's symbolic role. The Court will not buy \nit.\n  Further, even if this statute was upheld, it is, with great respect, \nvery inadequate. Not every flag desecration will cause or likely cause \na breach of the peace or violence. That will depend on circumstances. \nFrankly, I do not want the protection of the flag to be limited to \nthose narrow circumstances.\n  And these are very narrow circumstances. A flag desecrated in the \nmidst of a crowd of those sympathetic to the desecrator will not elicit \na penalty. Those who see it on television or in a news photo or from a \ndistant sidewalk may not like it, but it will not violate a breach of \nthe peace statute.\n  Moreover, of course, not every flag which is physically desecrated is \nstolen from the Federal Government, or stolen and desecrated on Federal \nland.\n\n  Indeed, this statute in no way changes the result in the Texas versus \nJohnson case, which creates the problem bringing us to the floor of the \nSenate in the first place.\n  In Johnson, the State of Texas defended its flag burning statute on \nthe ground that it prevented speech that caused violence or breaches of \nthe peace. The Court brushed aside Texas' evidence that witnesses of \nGregory Johnson's flag burning were seriously offended and might have \ncaused disorder. Instead, the Court simply noted that--\n\n       No disturbance of the peace actually occurred or threatened \n     to occur because of Johnson's burning of the flag. . . . The \n     state's position . . . amounts to a claim that an audience \n     that takes serious offense at particular expression is \n     necessarily likely to disturb the peace and that expression \n     may be prohibited on this basis. Our precedents do not \n     countenance such a presumption. . . .'' [491 U.S. at 408].\n\n  The Court also determined that Johnson did not run afoul of the \nfighting words doctrine. The Court concluded that ``no reasonable \nonlooker would have regarded Johnson's generalized expression of \ndissatisfaction with the policies of the Federal Government as a direct \npersonal insult or an invitation to exchange fisticuffs.'' Thus, \nsection (a) of the proposed statute does not cover Johnson. Nor does \nsection (b) cover Johnson, because the flag he burned did not belong to \nthe United States. It was taken from a bank building. Finally, section \n(c) is inapplicable--Johnson burned the flag in front of city hall, \nnot, apparently, on federal land.\n  If Gregory Johnson could not be held criminally liable under the \nSenator's proposed statute, who could?\n  I ask unanimous consent to enter into the Record letters from Prof. \nRichard Parker of Harvard Law School, Prof. Steven Pressler of \nNorthwestern Law School, concerning the McConnell statute.\n  There being no objection, the letters were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                          Northwestern University,\n\n\n                                                School of Law,\n\n                                     Chicago, IL, December 4, 1995\n     Hon. Orrin G. Hatch,\n     Chairman, U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Hatch: You have asked for my thoughts \n     regarding the constitutionality of S. 1335, the Flag \n     Protection and Free Speech Act of 1995. I understand that the \n     sponsors of the legislation, based on an analysis performed \n     by the Congressional Research Service, and apparently also \n     advised by some legal scholars (whose names, as far as I \n     know, have not been made public) have asserted that the act \n     would be able to pass muster in any court review of the act. \n     In my view that is simply incorrect. At least as far as the \n     key section of the proposed act, subsection (a), is \n     concerned, I simply do not see any way in which the statute \n     could meet the tests for constitutionality laid down in \n     United States v. Lopes, 115 S. Ct. 1624 (1995), Texas v. \n     Johnson, 491 U.S. 397 (1989), and U.S. v. Eichman, 496 U.S. \n     310 (1990).\n       Subsection (a) of the proposed Act would penalize the \n     conduct of flag-burning when the flag burner does so with the \n     primary purpose and intent to produce a branch of the peace \n     or imminent violence, and in circumstances where the offender \n     knows it is reasonably likely to produce imminent violence or \n     a breach of the peace. There is no general federal power \n     given to Congress to prevent breaches of the peace or \n     safeguard against imminent violence. For Congress to assert \n     this power, presumably under the commerce clause, would \n     result in the statute being struck down under United States \n     v. Lopez, 115 S. Ct. 1624. If Congress cannot pass the Gun \n     Free School Zones Act (which presumably had a similar \n     purpose) I can't imagine that subsection (a) of the Flag \n     Protection and Free Speech Act would survive either.\n       The alternative ground for the Act, Congress's power to \n     protect the national symbol, has been clearly ruled out by \n     Johnson and Eichman, where the court has indicated as clearly \n     as can be that flag desecration, because the court believes \n     it to be a protected form of speech, is a symbolic act which \n     in no way harms the symbolic value of the flag. Indeed, in \n     the Court's view, the desecration of the flag simply \n     reinforces the symbolic value of the flag. Congress is \n     thus without power to prohibit flag burning or flag \n     desecration by statute, as we made clear in the Eichman \n     case, when an assertedly content-neutral federal statute \n     was struck down.\n       As you may remember, when Judge Bork and I testified before \n     the Senate Judiciary Subcommittee holding hearings on the \n     statute, we predicted the statute would be held \n     unconstitutional, and we were proven right by Eichman. \n     Subsection (a) of this statute would also be seen by the \n     courts for what it is, an attempt to do by statute what can \n     only be done by constitutional amendment. Given the decisions \n     in Johnson and Eichman, and given the current composition of \n     the court, the court would undoubtedly adhere to its view \n     that such a statute is an attempt to prohibit what the court \n     regards as protected speech. It should be remembered that the \n     statute struck down in Johnson itself was grounded in similar \n     notions about the need to prevent violence and prevent \n     breaches of the peace, and the court simply decided that a \n     statute calculated to prevent the expressive act of flag \n     burning could not be regarded as devoted to a constitutional \n     purpose.\n       I have heard it argued that the Supreme Court's recent \n     decision in Wisconsin v. Mitchell, 113 S.Ct. 2194 (1993), \n     which upheld an enhanced sentence for aggravated battery \n     because the defendant chose his victim on the basis of his \n     race, somehow suggests that the current court would be more \n     lenient in upholding statutes that implicate what has been \n     regarded as conduct protected by the First Amendment. There \n     is no merit to this argument. In Mitchell the court made \n     clear that the Wisconsin statute passed constitutional muster \n     because the conduct at which it was addressed (the infliction \n     of serious bodily harm) was ``unprotected by the First \n     Amendment.'' The conduct at which the Flag Protection and \n     Free Speech Act of 1996 is directed--burning or otherwise \n     destroying the American Flag in order to incite others--is \n     the destroying the American Flag in order to incite others--\n     is the very conduct which the Supreme Court declared in \n     Johnson and \n\n[[Page S 18284]]\n     Eichman is protected by the First Amendment. Mitchell simply has no \n     application.\n       The two subsections of the Flag Protection and Free Speech \n     Act of 1995, (b) and (o), which have to do with the stealing \n     or conversion of a flag belonging to the United States, and \n     the stealing or conversion of a flag on federally-controlled \n     land could conceivably survive scrutiny under Lopez (since it \n     is the task of the federal government to patrol federally-\n     controlled property), and it might be regarded as the task of \n     the federal government to punish theft and destruction of \n     federal or private property on federal lands. Even if this \n     were so, however, and it is by no means free from doubt, this \n     would do nothing to overcome the result in the Johnson case, \n     and others like it, where the flag destruction is prohibited \n     by state governments, or takes place on non-federally \n     controlled property.\n       The whole purpose of the efforts undertaken by the Citizens \n     Flag Alliance and countless numbers of Americans working at \n     the grass roots level (which have so far resulted in the \n     resolutions passed by forty-nine state legislatures asking \n     Congress to send the Flag Protection Amendment to the \n     States for ratification, and the passage of the Amendment \n     by much more than the requisite two-thirds vote in the \n     House of Representatives) was to reverse the result in \n     Texas v. Johnson, and give back to the American people \n     their right to protect their cherished national symbol in \n     the manner they had enjoyed prior to 1989. This included \n     protection by either state or federal governments, as \n     provided for by the Amendment. As I indicated in my \n     testimony before your subcommittee six years ago, five \n     years ago, and most recently last summer, a Constitutional \n     Amendment is a traditional manner in which the American \n     people have corrected erroneous decisions by the Supreme \n     Court, and in which they have asserted the sovereign \n     prerogative, which belongs to them alone.\n       As you have indicated many times, the Flag Protection \n     Amendment is a worthy measure, expressing noble ideals of \n     decency, civility, and responsibility very much in keeping \n     with American traditions. It should not be sidetracked by a \n     Quixotic quest for a statutory solution. I urge you to do all \n     you can to persuade the Senators who think a statute will \n     work that they are misinformed, and that the proposed \n     statute, if passed, would be declared unconstitutional with \n     regard to subsection (a), and that the remaining subsections \n     would do little to correct the unjust result of Texas v. \n     Johnson.\n       I appreciate the opportunity to share my views with you, \n     and I would be happy to help in any further manner I can.\n           Yours Sincerely,\n\n                                           Stephen B. Presser,\n\n                                         Raoul Berger Professor of\n                                                    Legal History.\n                                 ______\n\n\n\n                                           Harvard Law School,\n\n                                  Cambridge, MA, December 4, 1995.\n     Senator Orrin Hatch,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Hatch: Over the last several months, I've \n     found, in countless conversations with all sorts of people \n     about the proposed constitutional amendment to allow our \n     representatives to prohibit ``physical desecration'' of the \n     flag, that everybody agrees. We all agree that the flag is \n     the unique expression of our aspiration, as Americans, to \n     national unity. We agree that, nowadays, this aspiration is \n     under assault by a looming tide of disrespect for the very \n     idea of shared national values, to say nothing of patriotic \n     values. We agree that this tide must be stemmed, that when \n     these values are threatened, they must be defended. Rooted in \n     our hearts, they are expressed in symbols--especially, the \n     symbol of the flag--and so, we agree, it is those symbols \n     that we must protect.\n       On October 19, Senator McConnell gave voice to this basic \n     agreement on the floor of the Senate. He is, he said, \n     ``disgusted by those who desecrate our symbol of freedom.'' \n     ``[W]e should have zero tolerance for those who deface the \n     flag,'' he insisted.\n       Yet he said that not to support the flag amendment--but to \n     oppose it. He proposed, instead, statute to stem the tide. It \n     would, he said, serve his purpose; showing ``zero tolerance \n     for those who deface the flag'' by punishing those ``who \n     desecrate our symbol of freedom.'' He, no doubt, means his \n     statute to be interpreted in light of his stated purpose. \n     But--for that very reason--his statute would be an empty \n     gesture, a nullity, another depressing instance of \n     Washington's alienation from reality.\n       The reason is that his proposed statute would, predictably, \n     be struck down by the Supreme Court--just as, in 1990, \n     another statute, sold as a detour around a constitutional \n     amendment, was struck down. Lawyers sensitive to the the \n     spirit and tendency of the Court's recent decisions know \n     this, even if we wish it were otherwise.\n       Then, on November 8, a strange thing happened. Mr. John R. \n     Luckey (a Legislative Attorney in the American Law Division \n     of the Congressional Research Service at the Library of \n     Congress) wrote a two-and-a-half page memo stating--flatly \n     and blandly--that the proposed statute ``should survive \n     constitutional attack''. It is that very odd memo that I want \n     now to answer.\n       Though the memo demonstrates a truncated understanding of \n     constitutional law and the Supreme Court, it does get \n     something right. It notes that the proposed statute would not \n     reverse the decisions to which it is a response. It would not \n     protect the flag against ``physical desecration'' in most \n     instances--or even the instances involved in the Johnson and \n     Eichman cases. to show its ``zero tolerance'' for those who \n     ``deface the flag,'' it would reach but a few quirky \n     situations; where there is a ``primary'' purpose and intent \n     and a probability to ``incite or produce imminent violence or \n     a breach of the peace'' or where the flag was stolen from the \n     federal government, on or off federal lands. It would make a \n     little mole hill our of a big mountain.\n       On everything but this point, Mr. Luckey's memo is off \n     base. Its reading of constitutional law is, at best, utterly \n     wooden. It is an invitation--whether wide-eyed or winking--to \n     another slap down of the Congress by the Supreme Court, \n     reminiscent of the 1990 fiasco.\n       The subsections dealing with destruction of a flag stolen \n     from the federal government ``present no constitutional \n     difficulties,'' according to the memo. It offers two bases \n     for this misleading advice. First, it cites a few passages \n     and footnotes in Court opinions which leave undecided the \n     constitutional validity of prohibiting destruction of a flag \n     owned by the government. It reads those passages and \n     footnotes as deciding that such prohibition is valid. It thus \n     makes the mistake that law students soon learn not to make. A \n     question left open is not a question decided. How it will be \n     decided depends on the general principles--and tendencies--\n     that are moving the Court.\n       As the other basis for its advice, the memo notes three \n     present statutory provisions which prohibit the theft and \n     destruction of government property of all sorts in general. \n     By citing these provisions, it demonstrates again that its \n     author simply does not grasp the general principle that the \n     majority of the Court has been invoking since 1989.\n       The general principle at work is this: The majority of the \n     Court believes that flag desecration implicates the First \n     Amendment because the flag itself is ``speech.'' Since the \n     flag communicates a message--as it, undeniably, does--any \n     effort by government to single out the flag for protection \n     must involve regulation of expression on the basis of the \n     content of its message. The statutory provisions cited by the \n     memo do not ``single out the flag'' for protection. Hence, \n     they would satisfy the Court. But Senator McConnell's \n     proposed statute, by its terms, does ``single out the flag \n     for protection.'' Hence, it would be struck down by the \n     Court, as in 1990.\n       The proposed subsection dealing with incitement of violence \n     is, the memo advises, ``quite likely'' to pass constitutional \n     muster. The only virtue of this advice is in its \n     qualification. Even at that, it is wholly misleading. For--as \n     the memo notes--the Court has recently refused to allow \n     government ``to punish only those `fighting words' of which \n     [it] disapproves.'' The memo imagines that the subsection \n     would not run afoul of this principle because it supposedly \n     doesn't make a ``distinction between approved or disapproved \n     expression that is communicated'' by destruction of the flag. \n     It thereby makes the same mistake it made before. The memo \n     fails to grasp the Court's fundamental idea: that singling \n     out the flag for protection in and of itself makes a \n     ``distinction between approved and disapproved expression'' \n     and, so, violates the Constitution as it now stands.\n       Thus we come back, again and again, to Senator McConnell's \n     statement of the purpose of his proposed statutory detour \n     around a constitutional amendment. (In adjudicating the \n     constitutional validity of statutes, the Court looks to the \n     statements of their sponsors.) His purpose is to single out \n     the flag for protection. Plainly--according to the majority \n     of the Justices--this purpose is unconstitutional. According \n     to the Justices, the only way to realize this purpose is to \n     amend the Constitution, as was provided for in Article V by \n     the framers of that document.\n       Is there no way around it? Those reluctant to take up the \n     responsibility assigned by Article V seem to be grasping at \n     any straw. Recently, for example, I've heard that some are \n     citing Wisconsin v. Mitchell. There, the Court upheld a \n     statute under which a ``sentence for aggravated battery was \n     enhanced'' because the batterer ``intentionally selected his \n     victim on account of the victim's race.'' A prohibition of \n     the battery of a person, the Court said, is not ``directed at \n     expression'' and so does not implicate free speech. \n     Consideration of the motive for a battery--in this case \n     racial discrimination, a motive condemned under several civil \n     rights statutes--doesn't offend the First Amendment. This was \n     an easy case. It has no relevance whatsoever to Senator \n     McConnell's proposed statute. For his statute, which singles \n     out the flag for protection, is directed at expression. Its \n     purpose, stated by the Senator, is to enforce ``zero \n     tolerance for those who deface the flag.''\n       What if--to avoid a constitutional amendment--Senator \n     McConnell were to take back his statements in favor of the \n     flag? What if he said he never meant it? The Congressional \n     Record could not now be erased. The Court would see it. And, \n     in any event, it would look at the terms of his proposed \n     statute. Those terms make plain its purpose, a laudable \n     purpose, to single out the flag for protection. Yet that \n     purpose is exactly what offends the majority of the Justices.\n       To make good on Senator McConnell's purpose, there is one \n     and only one means under \n\n[[Page S 18285]]\n     the Constitution: a constitutional amendment.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                Richard D. Parker,\n                                                 Professor of Law.\n  Mr. HATCH. These letters make it very clear that the analysis by CRS \nis flawed.\n  My friend from Kentucky wrote an article in the December 5, 1995, \nWashington Post conceding that the Supreme Court had erred in its two \ndecisions, Johnson and Eichman. As he said: ``Much to my \ndisappointment, the Supreme Court has found that laws protecting the \nflag run afoul of the first amendment. It is hard to believe that \nburning a flag can be considered `speech.' But a majority of the court \nhas found this despicable behavior to be `political expression' \nprotected by the First Amendment.''\n  It is clear that Senator McConnell disagrees with the Supreme Court's \ndecision. Although, as he says, ``it is hard to believe,'' the Court \ndid hold that flag burning was speech. As the Court said in Johnson, \n``The expressive, overtly political nature of this conduct was both \nintentional and overwhelmingly apparent.'' In these circumstances, said \nthe Court, ``Johnson's burning of the flag was conduct sufficiently \nimbued with elements of communication, to implicate the first \namendment.'' [491] U.S. at 406]\n\n  My friend makes a critical mistake in acquiescing to the Supreme \nCourt's erroneous decision. Simply because five Justices of the Supreme \nCourt say that flag burning is protected speech does not mean that the \nCourt has correctly interpreted what the Constitution means. It is, no \ndoubt, the province of the judiciary to ``say what the law is,'' in \nChief Justice John Marshall's immortal words in Marbury versus Madison. \nBut it is not the exclusive responsibility of the courts to interpret \nthe Constitution.\n  In fact, the Framers of the Constitution believed that Congress would \nhave an independent duty to interpret the Constitution and to correct \nerrors of constitutional dimension. That is one of the purposes of \narticle V of the Constitution, which permits the amendment of the \nConstitution after two-thirds vote of Congress and three-fourths \napproval by the States. It is clear that the Framers intended article V \nto be used to correct errors in constitutional interpretation made by \nthe Supreme Court. Indeed, the 11th amendment, the first amendment \nratified after passage of the Bill of Rights, was approved by Congress \nand the States specifically to overrule a particular Supreme Court \ndecision, Chisolm versus Georgia.\n\n  It is our responsibility to correct the Supreme Court when it is \nwrong. And surely it was wrong in calling this offensive, terrible \nconduct protected speech.\n  Since my friend finds it ``hard to believe burning a flag can be \nconsidered speech,'' as I do, he ought to agree with me that the flag \nprotection amendment does not amend the first amendment. It overturns \ntwo erroneous Supreme Court decisions.\n  To obediently accept the Supreme Court's decisions in Johnson and \nEichman, as my friend from Kentucky would, when we know the Court is \nwrong, is to read article V out of the Constitution, and is to abdicate \nthe Senate's responsibility to the people and to the Constitution.\n  My friend is also dead wrong to suggest that this amendment \nauthorizes legislation to compel anyone to respect the flag. It does \nnot. No one can be forced to salute, honor, respect, or pledge \nallegiance to the flag under this amendment. So my friend's invocation \nof speech codes is, frankly, totally irrelevant. It is a straw \nargument.\n  Finally, my friend from Kentucky says ``it is hard to draw the line'' \nin determining what to protect. He cites vulgar or offensive renditions \nof our national anthem and asks, ``How can we single out the flag for \nspecial protection but not our country's song?'' Two hundred-plus years \nof history give us the answer. There is no other symbol like our flag. \nMoreover, while the national anthem is a great song, it is not a \ntangible symbol of the country. Ironically, the Senator's question \nanswers itself: our national anthem, the ``Star Spangled Banner,'' is \nabout our Nation's unique symbol.\n  These arguments get repeated over and over, but the flag protection \namendment is no precedent for any other legislative action because of \nthe uniqueness of our flag. Even the Clinton Justice Department \nacknowledged that the flag stands apart, sui generis, as a symbol of \nour country.\n  Right here behind me is a picture of what some of my colleagues call \nfreedom of speech--it is pathetic. Senator McConnell said here today \nthat prohibiting the burning of the flag ``strikes at the heart of our \ncherished freedom''--as overblown and exaggerated a statement as we \nwill hear in this debate.\n  Even one of the lawyers the Senator from Kentucky relies upon for his \nproposition on the issue, Bruce Fein, has written that Senate Joint \nResolution 31, the flag protection amendment, ``. . . is a \nsubmicroscopic encroachment on free expression . . .''\n  My friend from Nebraska says we should not compel patriotism. He says \nthat respect for the flag would mean something less if we were \ncompelled to offer such respect.\n  Mr. President, this straw argument is offered over and over again. \nThe flag protection amendment does not authorize any law which compels \nanyone to respect the flag, honor it, pledge allegiance to it, salute \nit, or even say nice things about it. It does not require anything like \nthat. So that is a straw argument.\n  There is an obvious difference between prohibiting someone from \nphysically desecrating our flag and compelling someone to respect it \nand salute it.\n  Moreover, I am astonished that anyone can claim that respect for our \nflag would mean something else if we enact legislative protection of \nthe flag. I am surprised anybody would argue that. Until 1989, 48 \nStates and the Federal Government prohibited flag desecration. Did any \nof my colleagues believe their respect for the flag meant something \nless in 1989 than it did after the misguided Johnson decision?\n  This issue boils down to this: Is it not ridiculous that the American \npeople have no legal power to protect their beloved national symbol?\n  Let me just reiterate what I said this morning. On Monday we will \noffer an amendment which deletes the States from the amendment. The \namendment will read as follows: ``The Congress shall have power''--the \nCongress shall have power--``to prohibit the physical desecration of \nthe flag of the United States.'' That is all it says. It is a very \nnarrow amendment that says, ``The Congress shall have power to prohibit \nthe physical desecration of the flag of the United States,'' not the \nStates. So Senators concerned about the multiplicity of State laws \nprotecting the flag need not worry about that anymore.\n  There would be one definition of ``physical desecration'' and one \ndefinition of ``flag of the United States.'' And those definitions will \nbe decided by the Congress of the United States, as it should be. And \nit will apply everywhere. And it will be a narrow definition. I have no \ndoubt about it. It will be one that will work and one that will lend \ncredibility to our values in our society, our values of patriotism, \nhonor, dignity, country, family. That is what this is all about.\n  This is a chance to have that debate on values, honor, dignity, \nfamily, country, yes, patriotism. I think that this amendment is worth \nit alone. I really do.\n  And those definitions that would be set by Congress would need the \nPresident's signature as well because it would be a statute. And either \nthe President will sign it, or veto it if he did not like it. So you \nhave all these checks and balances. Let us trust the people on this \nmatter.\n  The American Legion and the Citizen's Flag Alliance reluctantly \nsupport this compromise. We have gone more than halfway, and I ask the \nopponents of the amendment to accept this compromise. Let us at least \nprotect the flag at the Federal level. We can do it narrowly and do it \nfairly and do it in the right manner.\n  I am just going to say one or two more words about the amendment. It \namazes me that people come on this floor and say, ``It's terrible what \nthey're doing to our flag. We should not allow people to smear \nexcrement on it and put epithets and obscenities on it, and we \nshouldn't allow them to burn it and trample on it, and it is so \nterrible,'' but they are unwilling to do anything about stopping it. \n\n[[Page S 18286]]\n\n  Some had the temerity to say that ``Well, we don't have that many \nflag burnings and that many flag desecrations.'' Well, I submit we do, \nbecause every flag desecration that occurs--and we have had them every \nyear--every one that occurs is covered by the press and goes out to \nmillions of people in this country, every last one. And, frankly, it \naffects everybody in this country every time we see this kind of \nheinous conduct.\n  It is time for us to quit using these phony arguments and stand up \nand vote to honor our national symbol by merely giving Congress the \npower to honor it, if it so chooses, with the right of the President to \nveto whatever they do, if he or she so chooses.\n  Mr. President, I think we debated this enough today.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/12/08/senate-section/article/S18272-1", "month": "12", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "08", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S18286]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. HATCH.

Mr. President, I once more express reservations about the \npremise upon which we are proceeding in attempting to balance the \nbudget in 7 years. I am mindful that both my party and the President \nhave agreed to undertake this herculean task of reaching an accord \nwhere the difference between what the President has proposed and what \nthe congressional majority seeks is pegged at some $730 billion in \nentitlement savings, discretionary spending levels, and tax cuts. While \nI fully support their determination to curb deficit spending, I remain \nskeptical of the specific objective they have set.\n  With due respect for the Democratic leadership, I must express my \ncontinuing discomfort with the view that it is imperative that the \nFederal budget be balanced by a date certain. I have always believed, \nand continue to believe, that the Federal budget is not supposed to be \nin perpetual balance, but that as John Maynard Keynes wisely noted, it \nshould remain a flexible instrument of national economic policy, \nregistering a surplus in good times and engaging in stimulative \nspending in bad times. To insist on a balanced budget means requiring \ntax rates to be increased during a recession and outlays for such \nprograms as help for the unemployed to be decreased. This is not a \npalatable solution, and it is one with which most economists would find \nfault.\n  My views, I realize, are not widely held. Hence, I was most heartened \nto read the words of Robert Eisner, professor emeritus at Northwestern \nUniversity and a past president of the American Economic Association in \nthe Wall Street Journal of November 28. In an article entitled ``The \nDeficit Is Budget Battle's Red Herring,'' Professor Eisner states, and \nI most strongly concur, that balancing the budget is a ``brief \narmistice in a much larger war.'' What we are really engaged in is a \nfundamental disagreement about the role of Government in our lives.\n  The real objective of the so-called revolution is the effective \ndismantlement of progressive government as we have come to know and \nbenefit from for half a century. Federal spending on health care for \nthe elderly, the poor, and the disabled is being drastically reduced. \nCutbacks are contemplated in our investment in education, the \nenvironment, the arts and sciences, and foreign relations. These cuts \ntypify the great differences in priorities and values which distinguish \nthe opponents from the proponents of progressive government. And all of \nthis occurs while we focus on that red herring, the balanced budget.\n  Professor Eisner accepts the premise that government should provide \nactivities and services that the private economy would not provide or \nwould not provide adequately. And he recognizes that many of us believe \nthat the programs developed over the last 50 years are ``indispensable \nboth to stable economic growth and the social compact on which our \neconomic system and our society depend.''\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of Professor \nEisner's article be reprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               The Deficit Is Budget Battle's Red Herring\n\n                           (By Robert Eisner)\n\n       The agreement reached between President Clinton and \n     congressional Republicans to try to ``balance the budget'' by \n     uncertain measures in seven years is a brief armistice in a \n     much larger war. The war has very little to do with budget \n     deficits. What really concerns combatants on all sides--and \n     should concern the American people--is the role of government \n     in our economy and in our lives.\n       The ``balanced budget'' slogan is thought to ring very well \n     with voters, so well that virtually all politicians find it \n     obligatory to say that they, too, are committed to it. In \n     fact, it is not clear that the ring is very loud; it is \n     quickly drowned out by the suggestions that achieving balance \n     might entail cutting health care and education or, generally, \n     eliminating programs from which our citizenry think they \n     benefit. Even less popular is an obvious solution for \n     deficits--raising taxes. Last year's deficit, already down to \n     $164 billion from the $290 billion of three years earlier, \n     would have been wiped out completely with 12% more in federal \n     receipts. The transparency of Washington's alleged concern \n     for budget balancing is revealed by the various proposals for \n     tax cuts that in themselves only increase deficits.\n       The current argument is not about balancing the budget now \n     or even in seven years. It's about what to do to be able to \n     make a forecast that the budget will be ``balanced'' in 2002. \n     In January 1993, as the Bush administration was coming to a \n     close, its Office of Management and Budget forecast for that \n     fiscal year--already three months along--a deficit of $327 \n     billion. That estimate turned out to be $72 billion in excess \n     of the actual deficit of $255 billion. So who can honestly \n     predict now what tax revenues and outlays will be in seven \n     years?\n       The Congressional Budget Office projects 2.4% annual growth \n     in real gross domestic product and 3.2% inflation. The \n     Clinton administration's Office of Management and Budget \n     projects 0.1 to 0.2 percentage point more growth and 0.1 \n     percentage point less inflation, and those differences would \n     so affect revenues and outlays as to reduce accumulated \n     deficits by almost $500 billion in seven years, and more than \n     double that amount in 10 years. By 2005, these flight \n     differences in projections would amount to half of the CBO-\n     projected deficit. That suggests that raising the OMB \n     projected growth less than 0.2 percentage point and lowering \n     the projected inflation rate 0.1 percentage point more would \n     project a balanced budget by 2005 without any cuts in \n     government programs.\n       Newt Gingrich insists that the budget projections must be \n     based on ``honest scoring,'' implying somehow that Bill \n     Clinton's OMB is dishonest. But who is to say which \n     projections are correct? Many private forecasters are more \n     optimistic, and an increasing number of economists--and this \n     newspaper's editor--even suggest that considerably higher \n     growth is feasible. Even a modest 0.5 percentage point more, \n     to 3% a year, would wipe out the deficit well within seven \n     years.\n       But Sen. Phil Gramm gave away the game when he argued on \n     ``Face the Nation'' recently that a balanced budget that \n     would permit more government spending was unacceptable. No \n     deficit projections, accurate or inaccurate, should be used \n     as an excuse to avoid essential cuts in projected government \n     outlays.\n       And that is the real issue--not deficits and debt but the \n     role of government. Conservative economists arguing for a \n     balanced budget have long made clear that it is not \n     deficits in themselves that concern them but the fact \n     that, given public aversion to taxes, preventing deficits \n     would hold down government spending. Voters would not \n     permit increased spending if it had to be financed by \n     taxes rather than painless borrowing.\n       Of course, these conservative economists are right in \n     recognizing that deficits and an essentially domestically \n     held public debt such as ours are not a concern. As Abraham \n     Lincoln said in his 1864 Annual Message to Congress: ``The \n     great advantage of citizens being creditors as well as \n     debtors with relation to the public debt, is obvious. Men can \n     readily perceive that they cannot be much oppressed by a debt \n     which they owe themselves.''\n       One thing a balanced budget would do is eliminate efforts \n     by the government to maintain private purchasing power. Such \n     efforts would entail cutting tax rates, or at least leaving \n     them unchanged, and raising government benefits, or at least \n     allowing them to grow in the face of business downturns. \n     Insisting on a balanced budget means requiring tax rates to \n     be increased during a recession and outlays of unemployment \n     benefits and food stamps, for example, to be decreased. Aside \n     from the misery that some of these actions might entail, they \n     would appear to most economists as exactly the wrong thing to \n     do.\n       Government should provide activities and services that the \n     private economy would not provide or would not provide \n     adequately. Much of social insurance is in this category--\n     retirement benefits and medical care for the aged, \n     unemployment benefits for the jobless and ``welfare'' \n     payments for those unable to work and their children. It is \n     perhaps not widely acknowledged, for reasons for electoral \n     politics, that the privatization that conservatives generally \n     favor would extend to Social Security.\n     \n[[Page S 18287]]\n\n       A further role for government is to be found in the \n     funding, if not always the provision, of education. This \n     would include such federal programs as Head Start for \n     preschoolers; school lunches in primary schools; apprentice \n     and school-to-work programs in high schools; and direct \n     loans, scholarships and social service programs to facilitate \n     enrollment in colleges and other post-secondary institutions. \n     Government would appear needed to support the basic research \n     on which progress in new technology and health maintenance \n     ultimately depend. And efforts such as the earned-income tax \n     credit and job training to get more people to work and off \n     pure government handouts are also viewed by many, including \n     President Clinton, as very much in order.\n       Republicans would generally reduce or eliminate these \n     programs and cut taxes, most heavily for those with high \n     incomes. They claim that this would help the economy and \n     hence ultimately make better off the poor and less fortunate \n     who have only been trapped in their worsening positions by \n     the government programs designed to help them.\n       The current Republican revolutionaries would reduce or \n     eliminate government programs that have been developing since \n     the New Deal of the 1930s. To the new revolutionaries these \n     programs injure the workings of a free-market economy that \n     has contributed so much to our well-being. But to many others \n     they are indispensable both to stable economic growth and the \n     social compact on which our economic system and our society \n     depend.\n       What we've been witnessing in these heated political \n     battles is not just posturing or boys fighting in the \n     schoolyard. There are fateful issues involved. But it is not \n     the deficit, stupid.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/12/08/senate-section/article/S18286-2", "month": "12", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "08", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S18287]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     PARTIAL-BIRTH ABORTION BAN ACT\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, the Senate voted on November 8 to commit \nH.R. 1833, the partial-birth abortion ban bill, to the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee for a hearing and, within 19 days, to report the bill back to \nthe full Senate. The Judiciary Committee held a hearing on this measure \non November 17. H.R. 1833 came before the Senate again yesterday, \nDecember 7, and I voted against this measure.\n  This is an extremely difficult issue, one which I have wrestled with \na great deal. However, after carefully listening to the debate and \nfollowing the Judiciary Committee hearing, I have concluded that this \nis a matter in which Congress should not impose its judgment over that \nof the medical community.\n  H.R. 1833, the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act, would criminalize a \nmedical procedure, the partial-birth abortion. Physicians have \nexpressed concern that the bill does not use recognized medical terms \nin defining partial-birth abortion, thus, creating uncertainty as to \nwhat procedures would be banned. It is my understanding that the \nAmerican College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists oppose this bill. \nBeyond the concern about the terminology used to define the procedure, \nthe college also expressed concern that Congress is attempting to \nimpose its judgment over that of physicians in medical matters.\n  The Senate Judiciary Committee hearing had a panel of physicians \ntestify who could not agree about this procedure. If doctors are \nuncertain, I do not believe it is a good idea for Congress to ban this \nprocedure in all instances. Although an exception for the life of the \nmother was adopted during this debate, the health of the mother is not \ntaken into account. It is my understanding that this procedure, in some \ncircumstances, may be the least risky option for a woman and may be \nnecessary to preserve the health and the future fertility of the woman.\n  Also testifying before the Senate Judiciary Committee were women who \nhad this procedure. I admire these women for coming forth to relate \ntheir painful and personal experiences so that the Senate could better \nunderstand the impact of this legislation. These women were faced with \nthe necessity of terminating their very much wanted pregnancies because \ntheir unborn babies suffered severe abnormalities. Their physicians \ndecided that in their tragic circumstances, this procedure was the \nsafest option.\n  No woman should have to face this situation. But unfortunately and \ntragically pregnancies do not always to as planned. Severe fetal \nabnormalities or the threat to a woman's life or health that may be \nexacerbated by pregnancy sometimes lead to the need for women and their \nfamilies to make difficult decisions. These are tragic decisions women \nand their doctors should make without the interference of the Congress. \nI sympathize greatly with the women and families who unfortunately have \nhad to face these decisions. If we enact this legislation, aren't we \nmaking the plight of women who may face this agonizing situation in the \nfuture that much more difficult by removing what may be the safest \noption as determined by the woman and her doctor?\n  In addition, the Supreme Court has ruled that States can ban, \nrestrict, or prohibit post-viability abortions except in cases where \nthe woman's life or health is a jeopardy. In fact, 41 States have \nchosen to restrict abortions after viability. I believe this issue is \nbest left to States to regulate.\n  Given the uncertainty in the medical community surrounding this \nprocedure and the unprecedented step this bill takes in criminalizing a \nmedical procedure, I voted against H.R. 1833. I do not believe that the \nFederal Government should be usurping the powers of the States in such \nmatters. Nor do I believe that politicians should be involved in \nprivate decisions between patients and their doctors regarding the \nappropriate medical treatment of serious heart-rending and critical \nhealth matters.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/12/08/senate-section/article/S18287-1", "month": "12", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "08", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S18287]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         THE BAD DEBT BOXSCORE\n\n  Mr. HELMS.

A bill to amend title 49, United States Code, relating to \nrequired employment investigations of pilots; to the Committee on \nCommerce, Science, and Transportation.\n\n[[Page S 18288]]\n\n\n\n         the air transportation safety improvement act of 1995\n\n Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I introduce the Air Transportation \nSafety Improvement Act of 1995, which will go a along way to ensure the \ncontinued safety of those who use the nation's air transportation \nsystem. Clearly, this legislation complements current more \ncomprehensive efforts to improve the Federal Aviation Administration \nand to enhance the safety and efficiency of the air traffic management \nsystem. In specific, this bill will permit the transfer of relevant \nemployment and training records to prospective employers when an \nindividual has applied for a position as a pilot.\n  The bill necessarily focuses on encouraging and facilitating the flow \nof information between employers so that safety is not compromised. In \naddition, to ensure that the burden of this legislation does not fall \non employers and the legal system, when a transfer is requested and \ncomplied with, both the employer who turns over the requested records \nand the prospective employer who receives them will be immune from \nlawsuits related to the transferred information. Complete immunity is \ncritical--without it, the legislative cannot achieve its objective of \nmaking it a common practice of prospective employers to research the \nexperience of pilots and to learn significant information that could \naffect air carrier hiring decisions and, ultimately, airline safety.\n  After reviewing information about certain investigations and \nrecommendations of the National Transportation Safety Board, I have \nbecome very concerned about deficiencies in the pre-employment \nscreening of pilots. Right now, the FAA requires airlines only to \ndetermine whether a pilot applicant has a pilot license, to check the \napplicant's driving record for alcohol or drug suspensions, and to \nverify that person's employment for the five previous years. Yet, the \nFAA does not require airlines to confirm flight experience or how a \npilot applicant performed at previous airlines. The NTSB, however, \nafter studying certain airline accidents that were determined to be \ncaused by pilot error, has recommended three times since 1988 that \nairlines should be required to check information about a pilot \napplicant's prior flight experience and performance with other \ncarriers.\n  Compounding my concern about the insufficient sharing of pilot \nperformance records among employers is that in the near future, there \nmay be a shortage of well-qualified U.S. airline pilots because the \nmilitary, which in the past has regularly trained the vast majority of \nairline pilots, will be training fewer of them. This will happen at the \nsame time that the demand for pilots at U.S. major and regional \ncarriers increases. Since many future pilots will not have experienced \nrigorous and reliable military aviation training, the ability of \nprospective employers to have access to records from previous employers \nwill be even more critical to airline and passenger safety.\n  Safety in our nation's air transportation system is paramount. I \nbelieve this bill will not only encourage employers to make more \nthorough background checks of the pilots they hire, but will also \nenhance safety.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that this legislation and \ncertain newspaper articles dealing with this matter be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1461\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled, That \n     section 44936 of title 49, United States Code, is amended by \n     adding at the end thereof the following:\n       ``(f) Records of Employment.--\n       ``(1) In general.--An air carrier or foreign air carrier \n     receiving an application for employment from an individual \n     seeking a position as a pilot may request and receive records \n     described in paragraph (2) relating to that individual's \n     employment from any person who has employed that individual \n     at any time during the 5 years preceding the application.\n       ``(2) Records to which subsection applies.--The records \n     referred to in paragraph (1) are--\n       ``(A) the personnel file of the individual;\n       ``(B) any records maintained under the regulations set \n     forth in--\n       ``(i) section 121.683 of title 14, Code of Federal \n     Regulations;\n       ``(ii) paragraph (A) of section VI, appendix I, part 121 of \n     title 14, Code of Federal Regulations;\n       ``(iii) section 125.401 of title 14, Code of Federal \n     Regulations;\n       ``(iv) section 127.301 of title 14, Code of Federal \n     Regulations;

Wald)\n\n       Washington, November 9.--The National Transportation Safety \n     Board recommended today that the Government keep employment \n     records on pilots to keep bad ones from jumping from job to \n     job.\n       The recommendation came after the board blamed the crash of \n     an American Eagle turboprop last November on pilot error; the \n     pilot had been hired a few days before he was to be dismissed \n     by his previous employer, but American did not know that.\n       Currently, airlines do not share such data out of concern \n     that a pilot denied employment because of unfavorable \n     information provided by a former employer can sue.\n       ``We can't permit liability to drive safety issues,'' James \n     E. Hall, chairman of the safety board, said in a telephone \n     interview today. ``Somebody has got to take a step forward to \n     do what's in the public interest.''\n       But the board said privacy questions must be worked out. \n     Moreover, the Federal Aviation Administration, which the \n     safety board wants to compile the data, was reluctant to act \n     without Congressional authorization.\n       The organizations representing the commuter airlines and \n     the major carriers both expressed support yesterday, although \n     a pilots' union said it objected to such a move.\n       Last month the safety board concluded that American Eagle \n     flight 3372, a twin-engine turboprop on the way to Raleigh-\n     Durham International Airport from Greensboro, \n\n[[Page S 18289]]\n     N.C., crashed after the pilot, Michael P. Hillis, became confused about \n     whether the left engine had stopped and failed to focus on \n     flying the airplane. Mr. Hillis. who was killed in the crash, \n     along the co-pilot and 13 of the 18 passengers, had been on \n     the verge of dismissal from Comair, a smaller carrier, when \n     he was hired by American.\n       American said it never asked Comair about Mr. Hillis's \n     record because it was unlikely that the airline would divulge \n     anything beyond the dates of employment and the kind of \n     equipment that the pilot flew.\n       The safety board recommended that the airlines and the \n     F.A.A. develop a standardized report on ``pilot performance \n     in activities that assess skills, abilities, knowledge, and \n     judgment.'' The data would be stored by the F.A.A., and with \n     a pilot's permission, could be given to potential employers.\n       Walter S. Coleman, president of the Regional Airline \n     Association, which represents commuter carriers said in a \n     statement that his group ``supports the intent'' of the \n     Safety Board's recommendations.\n       At the Air Transport Association, which represents the \n     major carriers, Tim Neale, a spokesman, said, ``I don't think \n     this is going to cause problem for the airlines.''\n       The Air Line Pilot's Association said that any deficiencies \n     in Mr. Hillis's performance should have been obvious because \n     he had been with the airline for four years by the time of \n     the crash. The union also said test results should not be \n     shared among airlines because the tests were not \n     standardized. It called for more training of pilots.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n                    [From USA Today, Sept. 29, 1995]\n\n                 Public Deserves More From FAA Watchdog\n\n       How long does it take to learn from your mistakes? At the \n     Federal Aviation Administration, guardian of public air \n     safety, the answer is a disastrously long time.\n       In a three-part series concluded Thursday, USA TODAY \n     reporters Julie Schmit and John Ritter reveal that the system \n     for assuring pilot competence is dangerously flawed. In fact, \n     it has contributed to 111 deaths, all but one on small \n     airlines, which have less-experienced pilots.\n       At the heart of the problem is the FAA. The record shows \n     the FAA was warned repeatedly about flaws in pilot testing \n     and hiring, that it recognized the flaws and that it was \n     flagrantly ineffective in fixing them.\n       One telling example:\n       On Nov. 15, 1987, 28 passengers and crew died when \n     Continental Flight 1713 crashed on takeoff from Denver. \n     National Transportation Safety Board investigators blamed the \n     crash on bad flying by co-pilot Lee Bruecher. Unbeknown to \n     Continental, Bruecher had been fired from one airline. He'd \n     also flunked pilot tests and had been cited nine times for \n     motor vehicle violations, a red flag for risky pilots.\n       The NTSB's conclusion: Airlines should be required to check \n     previous employer records of prospective pilots, including \n     test scores, training results, performance evaluations and \n     disciplinary actions.\n       The FAA's response: No. Its rationale: Benefits from such \n     regulatory change would not justify enforcement costs.\n       Eight years and six pilot-error airline crashes later, \n     airlines still were not required to verify applicants' flight \n     experience.\n       That set the stage for crash 7, an American Eagle accident \n     last December in North Carolina explored in detail by the USA \n     TODAY reporters. They found that the pilot, Michael Hillis, \n     was widely known for indecisiveness. Documents showed he'd \n     failed FAA check-rides, and his judgment in critical \n     situations had been found unsatisfactory by previous \n     employers. But the airline didn't know all that until after \n     Hillis ran his plane into trees at 200 mph, killing 15, \n     including himself.\n       Another pilot-safety flaw emerged from the reporters' \n     research, as well.\n       Had the FAA required more crew-coordination training, \n     Hillis' co-pilot, who'd never met his captain before the \n     flight, might have been able to override his errors. The NTSB \n     has warned the FAA since 1979 of the critical need for \n     improved crew-coordination training. But the FAA failed to \n     act until this year.\n       All this points to a problem larger than pilot error. Again \n     and again, the NTSB has told the FAA what's broken in \n     aviation and how to fix it. Yet critical improvements have \n     stalled--and not just because of incompetence or bureaucratic \n     sluggishness.\n       The FAA is hamstrung by a conflicting mandate. It is \n     charged with both protecting safety and promoting air travel.\n       So while it can mandate safety measures, it must first \n     weigh the cost-benefit wisdom of its changes. The result: too \n     little, too late in safety improvements.\n       There are recent signs of progress with new FAA rules for \n     enhanced pilot training and renewed interest in background \n     checks. But even these are half-measures, requiring only some \n     airlines to comply and making some rules voluntary. And this \n     comes as a pilot shortage is approaching.\n       If ever a lesson is to be learned from aviation accidents, \n     it is that timidity has no place in safety. The NTSB knows \n     that. It's time the FAA did as well.\n       Regional airlines caught in a bind. Business is booming for \n     small airlines, but their supply of military-trained pilots \n     is down. And there's little incentive for prospective pilots \n     to spend four years and $70,000 for a commercial pilot's \n     license to get a job that starts at $14,000 per year. \n     Meanwhile, starting jobs at the major airlines pay twice that \n     and can reach more than $100,000 after 10 years.\n       Military trains fewer pilots: 1992, 3,742; 1996, 2,678(1).\n       Regional airline business soaring.

Michael Hillis washed out at his \n     first airline, Comair. Eagle hired him without knowing that. \n     Last year, he crashed a plane, killing himself and 14 others. \n     Should airlines share records of pilot training and \n     performance?\n       Pena: That was a very upsetting (crash). We are working \n     with Congress to get legislation passed to allow airlines to \n     share (pilot performance) information, and we will support \n     such legislation.\n       Q: What do you say to people who are shocked that a pilot \n     who failed at one airline could get hired at another?\n       Broderick: I am incensed, too, every time an accident \n     happens. We work 24 hours a day trying to make this system a \n     zero-accident system. I think we've got it to where it is the \n     best in the world. It is still not good enough, and every \n     time the system fails, it is extremely frustrating to all of \n     us. We want to do whatever it takes to make sure that failure \n     never happens again.\n       Q: Did the system fail in the American Eagle crash?\n       Broderick: The system failed because a plane crashed and \n     people lost their lives.\n       Q: Does that mean the system doesn't always identify weak \n     pilots?\n       Broderick: No. It points out where they're weak so we can \n     train them in areas where they need it. Success isn't in \n     getting rid of people. Success is having qualified people on \n     the flight deck. If the system is such that you fail (and) \n     you're out, it couldn't work.\n       Q: In the past 12 years, there have been 16 fatal accidents \n     in 15- to 19-seat planes. In five of those, the FAA was cited \n     for inadequate supervision of the airline. Is that \n     acceptable?\n       Pena: No. Absolutely not. We're going to continue to press \n     to improve the level of safety for smaller planes.\n       Q: But what are you doing to hold the FAA to a higher \n     standard?\n       Pena: We have a new management team in place that is very \n     focused on this issue. And I am very focused on this issue. \n     We've changed our attitude. We've sent a strong message to \n     everybody to think of safety differently than the way it was \n     viewed in the past, which was ``accidents will happen.'' No \n     one would say that, but that was the unstated assumption. Our \n     attitude now is ``no more accidents.'' Our thinking now is \n     perfection.\n       Q: What have you done to make that reality?\n       Pena: We've added more inspectors. We've reached an \n     agreement, which was a big breakthrough, with the airlines. \n     We can now review all their flight data recorders (the \n     ``black boxes'' on planes that record pilot conversations). \n     In some cases, they show mistakes made by pilots. We can take \n     that information and share it with all pilots to show (that) \n     that was the wrong thing to do, here is what should have been \n     done. We've also pushed for a higher level of safety on \n     regional airlines. (Next year, all regionals will have to \n     meet many of the same safety standards already in use at \n     large regional and major airlines.)\n       Q: Safety investigators have cited inadequate pilot \n     training as a factor in two fatal crashes since 1985. In one, \n     the FAA had allowed an airline to reduce training below the \n     FAA's minimum standard. Why do you set minimum standards and \n     then allow airlines to go below them?\n       Hinson: Any exemption we grant is only done when it is an \n     equivalent level of safety. In regulatory law, you write a \n     regulation that focuses on what you're trying to accomplish \n     but realizes there is more than one path. It takes five years \n     to build an airplane. It takes three years to redesign an \n     airline's training program. We cannot change our regulations \n     every six months. One of the purposes of having exemptions is \n     to allow air carriers to take advantage of new technology \n     within the existing framework so we don't have to say to \n     them, `I'm sorry, the rule doesn't allow this.'\n       Q: The FAA is supposed to regulate and promote aviation. \n     Aren't those conflicting responsibilities?\n       Q: Hinson: No. We are to provide a safe aviation \n     environment. In that context, promotion means we should have \n     laws giving us authority to set standards, impose penalties \n     and provide enforcement. The most aggressive form of \n     promotion is to have the confidence of people who use the \n     system.\n       Q: Before the FAA passes a new regulation, it must weight \n     the cost of it to the airlines.\n       Q: Hinson: That's true. We could provide a regulatory \n     environment that was so strict and so punitive that people \n     would ask, `Why go into that business?' We could say (planes) \n     must have six engines, four pilots instead of \n\n[[Page S 18290]]\n     two. We don't do that. We have 17 cost-benefit laws that we have to \n     answer to. The National Transportation Safety Board and the \n     other oversight groups can have opinions without regard for \n     cost. We can't.\n       Q: One criticism is that it takes repeated accidents before \n     the FAA acts. What's being done?\n       Q: Hinson: To some degree that is a fair criticism. It \n     results from a propensity of our people to be extremely \n     cautious and it comes back to the requirement of cost-benefit \n     analysis. We are beginning to see a reduction in the \n     processing time of regulations. One of my charges is to \n     create more sense of urgency in that arena.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n                    [From USA Today, Sept. 28, 1995]\n\n     Expense Sometimes Stops FAA From Ordering Safety Improvements\n\n                   (By John Ritter and Julie Schmit)\n\n       The FAA rejects dozens of changes it deems to costly or \n     burdensome to airlines, even if other experts think they're \n     important to safe airliner operation.\n       Sometimes the FAA repeatedly turns down a National \n     Transportation Safety Board recommendation--under industry \n     pressure, critics say--only to accept it later after more \n     crashes.\n       December's American Eagle crash near Raleigh, N.C., is an \n     example. Records show the pilot had been forced to resign at \n     one airline. But Eagle hired him unaware of his poor record.\n       Three times since 1988, the NTSB had urged tougher pilot \n     background checks, including verifying flight, training and \n     disciplinary records and FAA violations. But the FAA says \n     enforcing a new regulation would be too costly and leaves \n     such checks up to the airlines.\n       There are other examples:\n       The NTSB urged ground-proximity warning devices on planes \n     in 1986. An FAA rule requiring them took effect last year, \n     but loopholes will delay full compliance until 1996.\n       After a 1993 Express II accident near Hibbing, Minn., the \n     NTSB said the device would have given pilots 33 seconds' \n     notice they were too close to the ground--plus an urgent \n     ``pull up'' warning 21 seconds before--time enough to avoid \n     the crash, which killed 18.\n       Fatal runway crashes in Los Angeles, Detroit and Atlanta \n     within a year led the NTSB in 1991 to urge the FAA to speed \n     up installing ground radar.\n       The FAA moved quickly but delays persisted. In November, a \n     TWA MD-80 took off from St. Louis while a Cessna was on its \n     runway. The jet sheared the top off the smaller plane, \n     killing two pilots. The MD-80 passengers escaped.\n       Investigators found that the FAA modifications had delayed \n     St. Louis' radar. The NTSB then asked for a schedule for \n     remaining airports and held a hearing to pressure the FAA. \n     Even now, ``We don't expect them to have the system fully \n     installed until 1999,'' says Barry Sweedler, director of the \n     NTSB's safety recommendations office.\n       In 1979 the NTSB began urging a new kind of training to \n     make cockpit crews work together better. And although the \n     majors and some regionals now teach Crew Resource Management \n     (CRM), it's not uniform or required.\n       But most crashes involving pilot error can be traced to CRM \n     deficiencies--faulty communication or poor coordination \n     between pilots.\n       New FAA rules this fall will require CRM industrywide for \n     all pilots flying planes with 10 or more seats. But it won't \n     be pass-fail training--pilots whose CRM skills are weak won't \n     necessarily be pulled from the cockpit.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n                    [From USA Today, Sept. 28, 1995]\n\n        Pilot Error: Solutions, Better Regulations, Safer Skies\n\n       Problem: Pilot Supply 1. Provide public funding for pilot \n     training to ensure high quality. The Air Force spends \n     $533,000, on average, to train one pilot. It exposes pilots \n     to the latest aircraft and computer technologies. U.S. flight \n     schools, which rely almost completely on tuition, can't \n     afford such training. Most student pilots train in single-\n     engine planes quite unlike those flown by regional and major \n     airlines. Who must act: Congress, FAA. 2. Provide pilot \n     candidates with more financial assistance, including \n     guaranteed student loans and scholarships. That would ensure \n     that the industry gets the best applicants, not just those \n     who can afford the training. The cost of a commercial pilot \n     license and four-year degree is about $70,000. Most new \n     pilots find that it takes five years, or more, to get a job \n     that pays more than $30,000 a year. Who must act: Congress, \n     FAA. 3. Require airline pilots to have four-year degrees. \n     Many major airlines used to require a four-year degree. Now, \n     most list it as a preferred qualification. The military still \n     requires it of pilot applicants. Requiring bachelor's degrees \n     would help ensure that pilots have the ability to understand \n     today's sophisticated planes. Who must act: FAA, airlines. 4. \n     Have examiners chosen at random. Make it impossible for \n     pilots and student pilots to choose their own examiners for \n     licensing and aircraft certification tests. The current \n     system is open to abuse by examiners who give easy or short \n     tests. The more tests they give, the more money they make. \n     Who must act: FAA.\n       Problem: Pilot Hiring 5. Require tougher background checks \n     of pilot applicants. Airlines are required to verify an \n     applicant's pilot license and work history for the previous \n     five years. They also must check driving records for alcohol \n     or drug convictions. The FAA should require airlines to \n     verify applicants' flight experience, check FAA records for \n     accidents or violations and check any criminal records. The \n     National Transportation Safety Board has suggested tougher \n     background checks three times since 1988--each time after a \n     fatal accident. Who must act: Congress, FAA. 6. Require \n     airlines to share training records. These may reveal \n     recurring weaknesses on such things as judgment and decision-\n     making, which wouldn't show up in FAA records. Today, the \n     records aren't shared because airlines fear invasion-of-\n     privacy lawsuits from former employees. Who must act: \n     Congress, FAA. 7. Set minimum qualifications for new airline \n     pilots. Currently, each airline sets its own standards, which \n     go up and down based on the supply of applicants. When \n     supplies are tight, airlines often hire pilots who would not \n     be considered when applicants are plentiful. Who must act: \n     FAA.\n       Problem: Training 8. Tighten monitoring of exemptions and \n     waivers to the FAA's minimum training standards. Most major \n     airlines now exceed the FAA's minimums because the airlines \n     deem them too low. Even so, the FAA allows some regional \n     airlines to shorten training programs if it is convinced \n     their alternatives won't compromise safety. Waivers are given \n     by regional FAA inspectors. There is no national database, \n     which makes monitoring difficult. Who must act: FAA. 9. Speed \n     up implementation of new techniques such as the Advanced \n     Qualification Program. AQP requires airlines to train pilots \n     as crews--rather than individually--which improves crew \n     coordination, a key factor in many accidents. AQP also \n     identifies marginal pilots sooner because pilots are tested \n     more often throughout the training process instead of just \n     once at the end. Who must act: FAA, airlines.\n       Problem: Testing 10. Require airlines to better monitor \n     pilots who barely pass flight tests. Now pilots pass or fail. \n     If they pass, they don't get more training. If they fail, \n     they do. The system does not recognize that some pilots pass \n     with ease while others struggle. Who must act: FAA, airlines.\n       Problem: Oversight 11. Encourage pilots to report unsafe \n     pilots by requiring airlines and unions to establish and \n     monitor reporting systems. Most airlines have union \n     committees for this, but it's not an FAA requirement. Who \n     must act: FAA, airlines. 12. Require the FAA to improve the \n     quality of its own databases, which often are incomplete and \n     inaccurate. The FAA has more than 25 databases collecting \n     information on such things as failed pilot tests and pilot \n     violations. The databases are supposed to help the FAA target \n     inspections at high-risk airlines, but inspectors cannot rely \n     on poor data.

Fifty seconds later, the twin-\n     engine turboprop slams into woods west of Raleigh at 200 mph. \n     Both pilots and 13 passengers die.\n       American Eagle officials believe the crew of Flight 3379 \n     bungled a situation it was trained to handle. In November, \n     the National Transportation Safety Board is expected to \n     report--as it does in 7 out of 10 airplane accidents--that \n     the pilots made mistakes. Almost certainly the NTSB will \n     urge--for the fourth time in seven years--tougher background \n     checks of the nation's airline pilots.\n       What is clear from the third fatal crash in a year \n     involving a regional carrier--and the 18th in four years--is \n     that the flight captain, Michael Patrick Hillis, was a \n     marginal pilot who had managed to slip through the airline \n     industry's elaborate safety net. Moreover, the crash puts \n     under fresh scrutiny a decades-old, traditional-bound system \n     of hiring and training airline pilots.\n       The young Eagle captain had no violations on his record. \n     Hillis had never been in an accident. But he had failed tests \n     and shown poor judgment at two airlines. He had struggled \n     with landings easier than the one that confronted him out-\n     side Raleigh. He was not, his fellow pilots made clear, a man \n     they wanted to fly with in an emergency.\n       Shy, studious and unassuming, a quiet loner who found \n     relationships difficult, Hillis, 29, did not fit the take-\n     charge image of an airline pilot. An instructor who had him \n     in a small ground-school class weeks before the accident \n     couldn't remember him.\n       And throughout a five-year airline career, doubts had \n     persisted about his flying abilities.\n       ``He was very indecisive and very hesitant,'' says his \n     pastor, the Rev. Robert D. Spradley. ``Unless he changed into \n     something other than what we saw when he got in the cockpit, \n     those emergency decisions must have been very difficult for \n     Mike.''\n       William Gruber, a 20-year pilot at Embry-Riddle \n     Aeronautical University, concludes after reviewing Hillis' \n     career: ``I can't say I'd allow him to take command of an \n     aircraft.''\n       Hillis survived in a system that should have weeded him \n     out--a system of hiring, training and testing pilots that has \n     no fail-safe mechanism to keep track of marginal performers, \n     no way even to ensure that their records follow them from one \n     job to the next.\n       Flight 3379 underscores the randomness of air travel: \n     Pilots fly whole careers and never have an engine fail.\n       It underscores the contracts: The brief career of Hillis' \n     co-pilot, Matthew Sailor, was an exceptional and full of \n     promise as Hillis' was bumpy and unremarkable.\n       And it underscores the irony: On the eve of the fatal \n     flight, Hillis was ready to quit American Eagle. He had even \n     asked a friend about working at a Wal-Mart.\n       Most of all, Hillis' story underscores the imperfections of \n     the airline pilot system.\n       Eagle managers say Hillis was competent because he passed \n     every test he had to pass. ``We don't know any way we could \n     have caught this guy,'' says Robert Baker, vice president of \n     AMR, parent of American Eagle and American Airlines.\n       But a USA Today investigation reveals a less reassuring \n     picture of Hillis' hiring and advancement. Eagle never \n     learned the real reason he wanted to leave his first airline \n     for a lower-paying job at a second one.\n       Hillis was brought on board quickly by Eagle, an expanding \n     carrier eagerly hiring pilots. He didn't move up Eagle's \n     applicant pool gradually as Sailor, hired three years later, \n     did.\n       And, the preliminary crash report shows, when Hillis failed \n     an FAA check-ride--a key benchmark--Eagle ignored its own \n     rules and let the same examiner retest him.\n       In his Eagle file, Hillis had no evaluations by senior \n     captains he flew with his first year--a tool many airlines, \n     but not Eagle, use to identify poor performers.\n       He kept advancing, as he had since his first solo flight \n     not long after high school in 1984--from small single-engine \n     planes to twin engines, to planes that carried a few \n     passengers to planes that carried more.\n       But once he hit the airlines, troubles cropped up. When he \n     couldn't cut it in his first job, as a first officer at \n     Comair, a Cincinnati-based regional airline, Comair got rid \n     of him. That alone would have ended many careers, but not \n     this one.\n       Hillis' problems started in the first check-ride.\n       Hillis joined Comair as a co-pilot trainee in January 1990, \n     after flying four years for a small Memphis freight \n     operation. Weeks after arriving at Comair, he had his first \n     FAA check-ride and bombed.\n       In a check-ride, an examiner tests a pilot's skill on \n     takeoffs, approaches and landings. Hillis flunked three of \n     four landings, three of nine instrument procedures and one of \n     five takeoffs. Worse, he got what pilots liken to a scarlet \n     letter: ``unsatisfactory'' on judgment.\n       ``It means the examiner believes the guy shouldn't be \n     flying,'' says Robert Iverson, a longtime Eastern Airlines \n     pilot and former KIWI Airlines top executive. ``It is a \n     subtle way to pass that along . . . to say, `Hey management, \n     you better wake up.' ''\n       Instead, Hillis got more training and passed his retest two \n     days later. But in his early flights, captains flying with \n     him commented that his landings were still weak.\n       In April 1990, Comair Capt. Mitchell Serber rated Hillis in \n     the lowest fifth of pilots on flight skills, but above \n     average on willingness to learn. Serber also found him \n     impatient, a ``very high-strung person . . . who gets upset \n     with his performance to the point it distracts him.''\n       He had ``functional knowledge of his duties'' but not a \n     good understanding of the plane. After a month in the cockpit \n     with Hillis, Serber rated ``his overall performance as \n     weak.'' He certainly wasn't ready to be a captain, Serber \n     felt. He should stay a first officer at least a year.\n       On evaluation forms that asked if they would be comfortable \n     flying as a passenger with Hillis, Serber and two other \n     captains checked ``no.''\n       But by December, one of those captains found him ``moody \n     and unpredictable'' and urged dismissal. Serber, after talks \n     with Comair chief pilot Roger Scott, agreed. He had never \n     recommended firing a pilot.\n       Senior pilots warned about Hillis' flight weaknesses.\n       Serber was worried, he told safety investigators after the \n     crash, that Hillis would get tunnel vision in an emergency. \n     His timing was off: ``Mike was frequently behind the \n     airplane.'' He often lost situational awareness. He would \n     ``make large abrupt corrections, mostly on instrument \n     approaches.'' These deficiencies would all come into play in \n     the crash.\n       But even senior pilots' warnings weren't enough to get \n     Hillis fired. He was allowed to resign, on Jan. 3, 1991, \n     after less than a year at the airline. Comair won't discuss \n     details, but vice president K. Michael Stuart says, \n     ``Our system at a very early point determined that there \n     was a problem and we took care of it.''\n       Took care of it to a point. Unknown to Comair, in October \n     Hillis had applied for a job at Nashville Eagle, a regional \n     carrier flying under American Eagle's logo. In an application \n     letter he said he wanted to return to Tennessee.\n       On paper, he was a dream candidate: 2,100 flight hours, \n     above the 1,500 Eagle requires. And as a working airline \n     pilot, he had had more training than most. ``We naturally \n     assume they know what they're doing,'' says American's Baker.\n       Eagle officials had no idea Hillis was on thin ice at \n     Comair. They sent Comair a questionnaire they send all \n     previous employers. Hillis even authorized Comair in writing \n     to furnish information. One of the questions was, ``To what \n     degree was this person's job performance satisfactory?''\n       Comair didn't send the form back, Eagle executives say. \n     Rarely will an airline release information about a pilot. \n     Comair says it provides only dates of employment. Eagle has \n     the same policy. So do many companies outside the aviation \n     industry. They won't risk invasion of privacy and defamation \n     suits from ex-employees.\n       ``Sure, we'll ask for more,'' says former Eagle president \n     Bob Martens, ``but we don't get it for the same reason we \n     don't give it out: We're subject to lawsuits from \n     individuals.''\n       But privacy lawyers say there's no liability if the \n     information is true. ``It's a phobia companies have,'' says \n     Robert Ellis Smith, a Providence, R.I., privacy lawyer. ``I \n     call it a conspiracy of silence.''\n       But not by all. Some airlines won't hire without \n     information from previous employers. They want to know: Would \n     you hire this person again? ``If we don't get a response to \n     that, we don't hire,'' says William Traub, United Airlines \n     vice president.\n       Hiring without knowing how well a pilot performed elsewhere \n     worries safety experts. Three times since 1988, the NTSB has \n     urged the FAA to require airlines to do detailed background \n     checks before they hire and to provide the records of their \n     former pilots when another airline requests them. The FAA has \n     said enforcing such regulations would be too costly.\n       But since December's crash, FAA officials are considering \n     ways to require carriers to share information.\n       American officials, in hindsight, acknowledge the value of \n     sharing previous employment records. They want the FAA or \n     Congress to mandate it. ``We're already doing it with drug \n     and alcohol testing,'' Baker says. ``We're required by law to \n     pass that information on.'' The information goes into an FAS \n     database, which airlines can access.\n       But when Hillis applied, Eagle relied--as it still does \n     today--on its own screening and training to spot unworthy \n     pilots.\n       In that process, senior captains grill applicants on \n     cockpit situations. A security agency investigates gaps in \n     work history. Driving records are examined. There's a flight \n     test in an aircraft simulator and a medical exam, which, \n     like those at most airlines, exceeds FAA requirements.\n       Hillis went through his screening on Oct. 24, 1990, and \n     passed. But there should have been concern. He lacked two \n     qualifications Eagle prefers in its pilots: a college degree \n     and an airline transport pilot certificate, the highest class \n     of license.\n       In a Cessna simulator, Hillis flew adequately, and \n     evaluator Sam White saw ``very good captain potential.'' But \n     White also noticed that Hillis leveled off too low after \n     descending form cruise altitude, and was slow to correct the \n     mistake.\n       When asked if he had ever been fired or asked to resign \n     from a job, Hillis could honestly answer no. It wasn't until \n     two months \n\n[[Page S 18292]]\n     later that Comair would force him out. There's no record that Eagle \n     asked him during the screening about his work there.\n       Jennings Furlough, an Eagle flight standards manager who \n     interviewed Hillis, pronounced him a ``very good candidate.'' \n     On Jan. 7, 1991, four days after leaving Comair, he began \n     first officer training in a 19-passenger Jetstream turboprop.\n       Co-pilot Sailor came from a different flight background:\n       As Hillis started a new job, the co-pilot who died with him \n     in the crash, Matthew Sailor, was beginning his final \n     semester in aeronautical studies at the University of North \n     Dakota in Grand Forks, one of the top collegiate aviation \n     programs.\n       Over the next two years, Sailor, 22, would build a solid \n     resume flying as an instructor pilot to gain hours. ``He was \n     very proficient, one of the best we've had,'' says Joe \n     Sheble, owner of Sheble Aviation in Bullhead City, Ariz., \n     where Sailor earned advanced pilot and instructor ratings and \n     spend hundreds of hours teaching students how to handle \n     engine failure. ``He was probably as comfortable flying with \n     one engine as two,'' Sheble says.\n       Eagle hired Sailor in December 1993, two years after he \n     applied. He had both the college degree and top pilot \n     certificate Hillis had lacked. In contrast to Hillis, two \n     captains rated Sailor outstanding his first year, one of the \n     airline's best first officers.\n       By the time Sailor was hired, Hillis had been with Eagle \n     almost three years. His first year was unremarkable. A month \n     into his initial training as a first officer, he passed an \n     FAA check-ride in a Jetstream.\n       But in January 1992 he faced a crucial decision. Eagle's \n     ``up or out'' policy meant he had to upgrade to captain when \n     he rose high enough on the pilot seniority list or leave the \n     company. ``We do not want people to make careers of being co-\n     pilots,'' Baker says. Most airlines agree.\n       This was seven months after Command Airlines and Nashville \n     Eagle had merged to form Flagship, one of the four American \n     Eagle carriers. the new carrier was expanding rapidly.\n       It needed captains, and many first officers were upgrading. \n     It's not clear how eager Hillis was, but he had no choice. In \n     1993, the policy changed, and Eagle began allowing first \n     officers to defer upgrades up to a year.\n       Hillis began captain training in a Shorts 360, a 36-seat \n     turboprop. Almost immediately, he had problems.\n       Watching him in a simulator, instructor Ray Schaub rated \n     him unsatisfactory on two maneuvers. One was handling an \n     engine failure. The other was for not executing a go-around \n     of the airport after an engine failed on approach--the very \n     situation he would confront before the crash. After 15 \n     sessions Hillis passed his captain's check-ride and began \n     flying out of Raleigh-Durham.\n       Less than four months later, he was back in a Jetstream \n     when the number of Shorts captains was reduced. Now he had to \n     recertify in the plane he'd flown before as co-pilot.\n       Records show once more he struggled, blowing an approach \n     and flunking an FAA check-ride for the second time in his \n     career. He got his second unsatisfactory on judgment.\n       At most airlines, including Eagle, two failed check-rides \n     and two unsatisfactories on judgment would get a pilot kicked \n     out. But Eagle knew nothing of the record at Comair.\n       Hillis' FAA examiner, Kevin Cline, told investigators he \n     failed about 1 in 5 pilots, but only 2 percent or 3 percent \n     got an unsatisfactory in judgment.\n       Hillis got 1.8 more hours of simulator training. Then Cline \n     retested him, even though Eagle's policy is for another \n     examiner to retest. Cline passed him the second time.\n       Assigned to Raleigh-Durham, Hillis flew uneventfully for \n     the next two years. Eagle records show he passed eight checks \n     from September 1993 to July 1994.\n       Rumors spread and one pilot balked at flying with Hillis:\n       If Hillis struggled during those tests, a record wouldn't \n     have been kept at Eagle's training academy. That is Eagle's \n     policy, approved by the FAA, so that instructors make no \n     assumptions about how a pilot will perform.\n       But while Hillis was bearing up in the Eagle training \n     academy's predictable environment, pilots he was flying with \n     at Raleigh-Durham were talking about his indecisiveness and \n     poor judgment.\n       On Nov. 18, 1994, Sandra O'Steen was scheduled to be \n     Hillis' co-pilot from Raleigh to Knoxville, Tenn. She'd heard \n     the rumors and told Raleigh base manager Art Saboski she \n     didn't want to fly with Hillis--the only time she'd ever done \n     that.\n       Saboski confronted O'Steen: Did she want to be judged on \n     rumor? She said no and agreed to fly. During the flight, \n     Hillis asked her about the rumors. Ignore them, O'Steen said.\n       Later, she e-mailed Saboski that the flight ``went by the \n     book,'' signing off ``sorry for the fuss.'' She told \n     investigators that Hillis' flying skills were OK, but he \n     wasn't decisive.\n       Hillis was so upset about the rumors that he called Saboski \n     at home on a Saturday. They met on Monday, and Hillis told \n     his boss his reputation was being smeared. Saboski asked \n     Hillis twice if he thought he needed more training. ``He \n     pooh-poohed it,'' Saboski says. The meeting ended.\n       Saboski, who was supervising nearly 300 pilots, was torn. \n     ``Rumors fly like crazy,'' he says. ``The pilots are a \n     fraternity. But there's always a question in my mind as to \n     whether there's truth in what's being said.''\n       Former Eagle president Martens agrees Saboski did not have \n     enough information to act on.\n       Everyone's morale was low; layoffs were expected:\n       Three weeks later, on Dec. 10, American Eagle announced it \n     was pulling out of Raleigh-Durham. Low morale plunged lower. \n     Pilots were angry because they'd have to relocate or be \n     furloughed. They'd been grumbling all year about their \n     contract. They felt overworked and underpaid. Hillis shared \n     the anger, and the announcement, along with the flap over \n     rumors, apparently galvanized a decision to quit. He called \n     in sick on the 10th, 11th and 12th.\n       ``I tried to contact him. I knew something was going on,'' \n     says Jody Quinn, a friend since Hillis had come to Raleigh \n     two years before. He was, she says, not a hard person to \n     figure out: ``Just a good ol' down-to-earth everyday person. \n     But incredibly conscientious. On top of everything. Very \n     together and organized.''\n       To Quinn and North Carolina State University students Brent \n     Perry and Mike Parsons, who shared a house with him, Hillis \n     was a dedicated churchgoer, a man who liked nature and \n     photography. He studied a lot--especially airplane manuals \n     and economics. He'd accumulated 42 hours at Memphis State \n     University and was now taking courses at N.C. State.\n       ``He'd bounced around from here to there to everywhere,'' \n     Quinn says, ``and he just liked North Carolina and decided to \n     stay. . . . He wanted to finally finish something, finish his \n     degree. He wanted some roots.''\n       Hillis' mother, Theresa Myers of Wauchula, Fla., says her \n     son loved flying but was uncertain about his future. ``I \n     never wanted him to fly,'' she says. ``I wanted him to get a \n     college degree, and in the end I think that's what he wanted, \n     too.''\n       Spradley, his pastor, thought Hillis battled depression. \n     ``He lacked self-confidence and personal strength, not just \n     in his spiritual life but his social life as well. He didn't \n     make friends easily and while he wanted them desperately, he \n     didn't seem to know how to manage friendships.''\n       A job at Wal-Mart began to look appealing:\n       On Monday the 12th, Hillis studied for a final in his \n     economics class. He and Parsons watched the Monday Night \n     Football game, but Hillis was brooding about his future. He \n     asked Perry how he like working at Wal-Mart and whether it \n     had good benefits. ``He didn't like the idea of being \n     unemployed,'' Perry says.\n       The two talked about the Raleigh-Durham hub closing, and \n     Hillis said he was thinking of quitting that week. ``We \n     prayed about it, prayed about what he hoped to do,'' Persons \n     says.\n       Hillis' scheduled co-pilot the next day, Sailor, spent that \n     night in a hotel near the airport. Based in Miami, Sailor was \n     assigned temporarily to Raleigh-Durham. He had been an Eagle \n     pilot just a year, but told friends he wasn't worried about \n     being laid off.\n       He and Hillis--who had never met--were scheduled for a two-\n     day trip Tuesday and Wednesday. They flew the initial 38-\n     minute leg to Greensboro on Tuesday afternoon uneventfully.\n       As they took a break before flying the second leg, back to \n     Raleigh, Hillis told airport service rep Sara Brickhouse, \n     ``The company doesn't care about me.'' He was somber and \n     unhappy, she told investigators.\n       Less than two hours later, as the Jetstream descended \n     toward final approach into Raleigh, a small amber ignition \n     light, the left one, flashed on. Hillis, flying the plane, \n     said: ``Why's that ignition light on? We just had a flameout \n     (engine failure)?''\n       Sailor answered: ``I'm not sure what's going on with it.'' \n     Then Hillis declared: ``We had a flameout.''\n       The timing was bad. The plane, carrying a maximum weight \n     load and its engines on idle, was quickly slowing down. It \n     was at a point when Hillis should have been applying power to \n     maintain minimum approach speed.\n       For 30 seconds, he and Sailor considered what to do as the \n     plane stayed stable on its glide slope. They'd already \n     lowered the landing gear and set the flaps for landing. \n     Hillis decided to continue the approach and asked Sailor to \n     back him up. Twice the cockpit recorder caught the sound of \n     propellers out of sync.\n       Then Hillis made a fateful decision: He would abandon the \n     approach, fly around the airport and try another landing. It \n     would give them time to work the problem. Sailor said, ``All \n     right.''\n       The plane by then had slowed dangerously. A stall warning \n     horn blared, and Hillis called for maximum power in the good \n     engine to gain speed. But he apparently failed to make two \n     critical adjustments. Powering up the right engine would \n     cause the plane to rotate left. To counter that, he should \n     have raised the left wing and set full right rudder.\n       A stall warning horn blared again. ``Lower the nose, lower \n     the nose, lower the nose,'' Sailor told Hillis, to gain speed \n     and lift. Three seconds later, both stall horns went off. \n     Again, Sailor said, ``Lower the nose.'' By now, the plane was \n     rotating steeply left.\n       Then, ``it's the wrong foot, wrong foot, wrong engine,'' \n     Sailor said. Hillis trying in the dark cockpit to counter the \n     rotation and control the plane, had pressed the wrong rudder \n     pedal with his foot. The rotation, or yaw, only worsened.\n     \n[[Page S 18293]]\n\n       Six seconds later, at 6:34 p.m. ET, the plane slammed into \n     trees four miles from the runway at 200 mph. Fifteen of the \n     20 on board died.\n       From wreckage, investigators determined that at impact both \n     engines were functioning fully. Experts familiar with the \n     flight data say Hillis misdiagnosed the ignition light and \n     overreacted--escalating a minor anomaly into a catastrophe.\n       Familiar flaws had shown up again, this time for real: \n     suspect landing skills; the tendency to make major, abrupt \n     corrections; poor judgment. Preoccupied by the engine \n     problem--the tunnel vision others had worried about--Hillis \n     ignored the first rule in an emergency: keep flying the \n     plane.\n       He decided unequivocally that he had a dead engine but then \n     didn't conform it by advancing the throttle or checking the \n     rpm gauge.\n       The left engine could have lost power then regained it. One \n     thing the light is designed to indicate is that an internal \n     system is trying automatically to reignite the engine.\n       But in training, according to crash investigation records, \n     Eagle pilots were taught an ignition light coming on meant \n     only one thing: flameout.\n       Eagle instructors followed the operating manual of the \n     Jetstream's manufacturer, British Aerospace. Less than a \n     month after the crash, the company issued a ``Notice to \n     Operators'' that clarified what it means when the light comes \n     on. And Eagle has since changed its training manual.\n       The decision not to land turned out to be fatal.\n       In post-crash tests, investigators found that sometimes, \n     with engines at idle, the light came on when propeller speed \n     levers were advanced quickly. Hillis had done that five \n     seconds before he saw the light.\n       One thing is clear: Most pilots, trained to land planes on \n     one engine, would have shut down the bad engine and landed--\n     not tried a go-around at 1,800 feet. It was the decision to \n     circle that led to the sequence of events that caused the \n     crash.\n       Sailor must have sensed what was happening. As an \n     instructor in Arizona, he'd logged hundreds of hours teaching \n     people to handle engine failure in flight. American's Baker \n     is convinced, reading the voice transcript, that he ``had a \n     much better sense of what was going on.''\n       Pilots who have read transcripts of the final seconds give \n     this interpretation:\n       Sailor's comments seem intended to keep Hillis on track. `` \n     'K, you got it?'' he asks Hillis seconds after the light came \n     on. (Translation: Are you going to keep flying the plane?)\n       Then, ``We lost an engine?'' (You want the engine-out \n     procedure?)\n       Later, ``Watta you want me to do; you gonna continue'' the \n     approach? And Hillis says: ``OK, yeah. I'm gonna continue. \n     Just back me up.''\n       Fifteen seconds before impact, the plane slipping out of \n     control, Sailor says, ``You got it?'' (You want me to take \n     it?)\n       Finally, six seconds to impact, the recorder catches one \n     last word, from Sailor: ``Here.'' (Here, give it to me.)\n       But if Sailor thought the captain was in trouble, shouldn't \n     he have suggested shutting down the engine? And if he did \n     finally grab the plane from Hillis, why did he wait until it \n     was too late?\n       ``It's a very difficult move,'' Baker says, ``But if I saw \n     the treetops coming up, you'd have to fight me for that \n     airplane.''\n       In the culture of airline cockpits, co-pilots assume that \n     seasoned captains know what they're doing. Sailor had been \n     flying as a first officer less than a year. On loan from \n     Miami, he probably hadn't heard the rumors about Hillis. \n     Otherwise, he might have been more assertive.\n       The NTSB likely will criticize Eagle for not giving pilots \n     enough training in cockpit teamwork. But questions remain:\n       Was the crew--Hillis and Sailor--dysfunctional? Did Hillis, \n     the pilot in command with the questionable record, fail when \n     it mattered most?\n       Or were Hillis and Flight 3379's passengers the victims of \n     a system that failed?\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n                    [From USA Today, Sept. 26, 1995]\n\n             Marginal Pilots Put Passengers' Lives at Risk\n\n                   (By Julie Schmit and John Ritter)\n\n       Marvin Falitz, a pilot at Express II Airlines, failed three \n     flight tests in six years, hit a co-pilot and was suspended \n     once for sleeping in the cockpit during a flight.\n       On Dec. 1, 1993, on a short trip from Minneapolis to \n     Hibbing, Minn., Falitz tried a risky, steep approach.\n       Flight 5719, a Northwest Airlines commuter, crashed short \n     of the runway. All 18 on board died. Investigators blamed \n     Falitz. They also blamed the airline for ignoring repeated \n     warnings about his performance.\n       Other airlines have ignored warnings about bad pilots, too, \n     and passengers have died because of them.\n       Since November 1987, pilots with documented histories of \n     bad judgment, reckless behavior or poor performance have \n     caused six other fatal crashes--all but one on small \n     airlines. Death toll: 111, including crewmembers.\n       A USA Today investigation--including reviews of the \n     government's own safety reports--has found that despite the \n     nation's elaborate air safety system, marginal pilots get and \n     keep jobs. This is particularly true at commuter, or \n     regional, airlines, which often run on small budgets and hire \n     the least-experienced pilots.\n       At regionals, hiring standards vary widely and are \n     sometimes dangerously low. Training and testing procedures \n     don't catch all marginal pilots. A system of independent \n     contractors who test and license pilots is ripe for abuse.\n       And airlines are sometimes reluctant to fire bad pilots.\n       These problems are about to get worse: A shortage of well-\n     qualified pilots is expected through the next 15 years \n     because the military, which used to train 90% of U.S. airline \n     pilots, is training fewer and keeping them longer. At the \n     same time, demand for pilots is exploding, especially at \n     regionals--the fastest-growing segment of U.S. aviation.\n       ``The surplus of quality pilot applicants is about to \n     end,'' says Robert Besco, pilot-performance expert and \n     retired American Airlines pilot. ``It is a big problem. But \n     it is a tomorrow problem so the government and airlines have \n     their heads in the sand.''\n       The military has been a dependable supplier of pilots since \n     the passenger airline industry began growing after World War \n     II. It trains and tests pilots rigorously to weed out poor \n     performers.\n       As the supply of military pilots shrinks, regional airlines \n     will have to dip deeper into the pool of those trained at \n     civilian flight schools.\n       Regionals fly smaller planes between cities that major \n     airlines don't serve. Since 1988, major airlines have turned \n     over 65% of the routes less than 500 miles to commuters, says \n     airline analyst Sam Buttrick.\n       New regional pilots are paid $13,000 to $19,000 a year, \n     one-third of what major airlines pay new pilots. But \n     experience at that level can lead to lucrative jobs at the \n     majors.\n       Last year, new pilots hired by regionals that fly \n     turboprops had slightly more than half the experience of \n     pilots hired by major airlines. Yet regional pilots can fly \n     20% more hours than major airline pilots.\n       Their planes are less automated, and they fly at lower \n     altitudes where the weather is more severe. And because their \n     flights are shorter, regional pilots make more daily takeoffs \n     and landings, which is when most accidents occur.\n       According to government reports, for the past decade the \n     accident rate for regional airlines has been significantly \n     higher than the rate for major airlines. Still, accidents are \n     rare. People are nearly three times more likely to die in a \n     car than in a 15- to 19-seat plane, says aviation consultant \n     Morten Beyer.\n       The Federal Aviation Administration, which regulates \n     airlines, asserts regional airlines are safe--and getting \n     safer. Says Transportation Secretary Federico Pena: ``If \n     they're not, we shut them down.''\n       An analysis of official crash reports, however, shows that \n     some airlines are not always as safety conscious as they \n     should be--or as they say they are. The problems occur at \n     every stage in a pilot's career: licensing, hiring, training \n     and testing.\n\n\n             licensing: pilots can shop for easy examiners\n\n       To get a license to fly passenger planes, most pilots are \n     required by the FAA to have at least 191 hours of flying \n     time. Then they must pass FAA tests, usually given by FAA-\n     approved examiners for fees from $100 to $300. Pilots or \n     their instructors can choose the examiners. Just as lawyers \n     can shop for sympathetic judges, pilots can seek easy \n     testers.\n       ``If you're a real hard-nosed examiner, you run the risk \n     that (they) aren't going to call you,'' says John Perdue, an \n     aviation consultant and a retired Delta pilot.\n       Some flight schools, concerned about abuse, will let \n     students take tests only from examiners they endorse. ``I \n     want to know that (students) are tested by someone who's not \n     giving away that ticket,'' says Steve Van Kirk, 49, at \n     Northwest Airlines pilot and owner of Control Aero Corp. in \n     Frederick, Md.\n       But not all flight schools are that strict. And the system \n     is vulnerable to other abuses, such as examiners who rush \n     through tests so they can do more in a day.\n       In 1987, Continental Airlines hired 26-year-old Lee \n     Bruecher as a co-pilot. He was flying a DC-9 when it crashed \n     shortly after takeoff in Denver. The captain, Bruecher and 26 \n     others were killed. Bruecher had been fired in 1985 by Able \n     Aviation in Houston because he had a chronic problem of \n     becoming disoriented--a fact Continental failed to discover.\n       Safety investigator cited Continental for poor pre-\n     employment screening. Continental has since tightened its \n     screening procedures.\n       But Bruecher's career might have been cut short long before \n     he got to Continental. In 1983, he passed a test that allowed \n     him to fly multi-engine planes. Two months later, his \n     examiner was fired by the FAA for giving short, easy tests--\n     including one to Bruecher. FAA records say the examiner had \n     been under investigation for nine months.\n       Poor examiners remain a problem for the FAA. In May, it \n     revoked or suspended the licenses of 12 designated pilot \n     examiners for giving each other phony certificates, allowing \n     them to fly numerous types of planes. The FAA canceled the \n     certificates. It said none of the pilots had used them to fly \n     passengers. It appears the certificates were being collected \n     almost as a game.\n\n\n             hiring: fewer pilots, less cockpit experience\n\n       After pilots are licensed to fly passengers, most spend \n     years instructing others or flying \n\n[[Page S 18294]]\n     cargo. Their goal: build flight hours to land jobs with airlines. Most \n     major airlines require at least 2,500 flight hours; most \n     regionals, at least 1,500. Most pilots, when hired, exceed \n     the minimums.\n       But when faced with a shortage of pilots, airlines lower \n     their standards.\n       In 1985, 22% of new regional pilots had fewer than 2,000 \n     hours, says FAPA, an Atlanta-based aviation information \n     service. In 1990, when regionals faced tight pilot supplies, \n     44% of new pilots had fewer than 2,000 flight hours.\n       Even in years when pilots are plentiful, regionals hire \n     less experienced pilots.\n       In 1992, GP-Express hired pilot Vernon Schuety, 29, who had \n     850 flight hours, and pilot James Meadows, 24, who had 1,100 \n     hours. That June, the two flew together for the first time. \n     They crashed near Anniston, Ala., while attempting to land. \n     Three people died.\n       Investigators said the pilots lost awareness of the plane's \n     position and blamed pilot inexperience, among other things.\n       The flight was Capt. Schuety's first unsupervised flight as \n     an airline pilot. GP-Express, a Continental Express carrier, \n     had made him a captain right away, without the usual co-pilot \n     experience.\n       GP-Express president George Poullos says the pilots met all \n     of the FAA's requirements and that the airline only hires \n     pilots who meet or exceed the FAA's minimums.\n\n\n             hiring: little background checking is required\n\n       On April 22, 1992, Tomy International Flight 22, doing \n     business as air-taxi Scenic Air Tours, hit a mountain on the \n     island of Maui, Hawaii.\n       The pilot, Brett Jones, 26, and eight passengers died. \n     Investigators said Jones failed to use navigational aids to \n     stay clear of the mountain. He flew into clouds that hid it.\n       Investigators faulted the air taxi for not checking Jones' \n     background properly and faulted the FAA for not requiring \n     substantive background checks for all pilots. Jones, \n     investigators' records show, had been fired by five \n     employers, including a major airline, for poor performance. \n     He also lied about his flight experience.\n       Tomy International didn't uncover those facts because it \n     didn't have a policy of verifying an applicant's background. \n     The FAA started requiring a five-year employment check in \n     1992. Jones was hired in 1991.\n       The pre-employment check into Jones' aeronautical \n     background consisted of one phone call to a charter and cargo \n     airline, where Jones had worked one year. That operator said \n     Jones departed in good standing.\n       Jones also received a recommendation from the previous \n     owner of Tomy International, who had once employed him as a \n     van driver.\n       Tomy International did not return repeated phone calls.\n       The FAA requires airlines to do very little when checking \n     an applicant's background. They must verify that the \n     applicant has a pilot license; check motor vehicle records \n     for alcohol or drug suspensions; and verify the applicant's \n     employment for the previous five years.\n       The FAA does not require airlines to verify flight \n     experience, nor to check FAA records for accidents, \n     violations, warnings or fines--or if an applicant has a \n     criminal history.\n       ``They are strongly encouraged to check all those things \n     and we make it easy for them to do that,'' says Jeff Thal, \n     FAA spokesman.\n       Most important, an airline is not required to find out how \n     an applicant performed at any previous airline.\n       Airlines do give applicants flight and oral tests. And most \n     check FAA records and driving histories for more than just \n     alcohol or drug convictions. Two speeding tickets over a year \n     can get an applicant rejected at Southwest Airlines, for \n     example.\n       ``They're not law-abiding,'' says Paul Sterbenz, \n     Southwest's vice president of flight operations.\n       But an analysis of government crash reports shows that poor \n     pre-employment screening has contributed to passenger deaths.\n       Consider the Jan. 19, 1988, crash of a Trans-Colorado \n     plane, a now-defunct Continental Express carrier, near \n     Bayfield, Colo. Both pilots and seven passengers died. \n     Investigators faulted the pilots.\n       The captain, Stephen Silver, 36, had used cocaine the night \n     before the flight. His pre-employment record included a non-\n     fatal crash landing on the wrong runway, a suspended driver's \n     license and five moving vehicle violations in three years.\n       Co-pilot Ralph Harvey, 42, had been fired from another \n     regional airline for poor performance. his pre-employment \n     record also included two alcohol-related driving convictions \n     and one non-driving alcohol conviction.\n       At the time, the FAA did not require airlines to check for \n     alcohol- or drug-related driving convictions. Trans-Colorado \n     executives told investigators they were unaware of Harvey's \n     alcohol history, and Silver's driving history and previous \n     crash.\n       In another example, Aloha IslandAir hired Bruce Pollard. In \n     1989, Pollard crashed into a mountain, killing himself and 19 \n     others. Investigators cited Pollard's recklessness and \n     faulted the airline's hiring procedures. IslandAir didn't \n     check with Pollard's previous employers, the accident \n     investigation showed.\n       Two previous employers said he was careless and one of them \n     was about to fire him before he resigned to join IslandAir.\n       IslandAir learned. After the crash, it added tough \n     screening procedures that weeded out the pilot who later was \n     involved in Tomy International's 1992 Maui crash.\n       No airline checks what could be the most important records \n     of all: an applicant's training records at previous airlines. \n     To do so could run afoul of privacy laws, they say, and \n     subject the airline that shared them to suits.\n       Nonetheless, many airlines refuse to hire a pilot unless \n     they get a good reference from a previous airline-employer. \n     Threat of lawsuit or not.\n       But actual training records aren't shared. Those reveal how \n     pilots make decisions, handle stress and work with others--\n     insights that don't show up in FAA data and insights airlines \n     are hesitant to share.\n       If training records had been shared, 15 people might not \n     have died on Dec. 13, 1994, when an American Eagle plane \n     crashed near Raleigh-Durham, N.C. A preliminary government \n     report points to pilot error. Capt. Michael Hillis, 29, was \n     distracted by an engine failure warning light. While figuring \n     out what to do, he and his co-pilot let the plane lose too \n     much speed. It crashed four miles from the runway.\n       Hillis had been forced to resign from his first regional, \n     Comair, because his superiors worried about his skills and \n     decision-making abilities--facts documented in training \n     records that Eagle never saw.\n       The American Eagle crash has the FAA reconsidering its \n     stance, and Pena says he would support legislation to mandate \n     sharing of information between airlines.\n       ``We need to have that. I don't want unqualified pilots \n     flying those planes,'' he says.\n\n\n       training: faa doesn't keep track of all the waivers given\n\n       Once hired, pilots have to go through their airline's \n     training program. The FAA approves each program. The airlines \n     set requirements based on FAA minimums that are so low most \n     major airlines exceed them, sometimes by 50%.\n       ``They are the floor and should be viewed that way,'' says \n     William Traub, vice president of flight standards for United \n     Airlines.\n       Regionals are much less likely to exceed the minimums. Some \n     even fall short. Of 16 larger regionals surveyed at random by \n     USA TODAY, seven--including four American Eagle carriers--\n     said they were allowed to reduce training below FAA minimums. \n     The airlines say they were able to prove their programs were \n     superior or sufficient, even with fewer training hours.\n       The FAA keeps track of training exemptions, which are \n     granted by Washington after a formal review. But it doesn't \n     keep track of waivers, which are granted at the regional \n     level. The FAA doesn't even keep a central record of how many \n     waivers have been given.\n       The FAA even grants training waivers to its own inspectors. \n     In 1992, the Department of Transportation inspector general \n     criticized the FAA for allowing 18% of inspectors to skip \n     ongoing training designed to keep them sharp.\n       The FAA says safety is not compromised. ``The word \n     exemption does not mean we're giving anybody anything,'' says \n     FAA Administrator David Hinson. He says exemptions allow \n     airlines to use new techniques without waiting for new FAA \n     rules.\n       But the agency has rescinded waivers and exemptions after \n     crashes. For eight years, the FAA allowed Henson Airlines, \n     now Piedmont Airlines, to cut pilot flight training hours by \n     about 40%. That was rescinded in 1985 after 14 people died \n     when a plane crashed near Grottoes, Va.\n       Investigators blamed inadequate pilot training, among other \n     things. Currently, Piedmont has no training exemptions and \n     exceeds the FAA's minimum training requirements.\n       The FAA's willingness to grant waivers or exemptions \n     spotlights a flaw in its structure, safety experts say. The \n     agency has two missions: to promote aviation and to regulate \n     it. Critics say they are in conflict.\n       When an inspector decides on a waiver that might help a \n     carrier financially, is safety compromised? The FAA says no. \n     Others wonder.\n       ``The FAA is understaffed and politically invaded,'' says \n     aviation consultant Michael Boyd, president of Aviation \n     Systems Research Corp. ``The system is corrupt.''\n\n\n         testing: in pass/fail, no one knows who barely passed\n\n       Few professionals undergo as much training and testing as \n     pilots. Each year, most captains must have at least two \n     flight tests called ``check-rides.'' Co-pilots have one. \n     These flights with an examiner test a pilot's skill on such \n     things as takeoffs, approaches and landings.\n       ``Check-rides are a series of practiced maneuvers,'' says \n     Robert Iverson, former Eastern Airlines pilot and former CEO \n     of KIWI International Airlines. ``Practiced enough, even \n     marginal pilots can pass.''\n       In addition, pilots are graded pass/fail. If they fail, \n     they are pulled from the cockpit to get more training. Within \n     days, they are retested. If pilots pass check-rides, as more \n     than 90% do, they keep flying.\n       The pass/fail system does not recognize that some pilots \n     pass with ease while others struggle.\n       A small percentage, 1% to 2%, barely pass, flight \n     instructors say. Others put the percentage higher.\n       ``Maybe 5% are getting by, but probably shouldn't be,'' \n     says Van Kirk, the Northwest pilot. Even if 1% are just \n     getting by, that would be more than 500 U.S. airline pilots.\n     \n[[Page S 18295]]\n\n       In a 1994 review of major airline accidents, the NTSB \n     called check-rides ``subjective'' and noted differences among \n     airlines in how they graded pass/fail.\n       And most airlines do not keep closer tabs on pilots who \n     barely pass.\n       United is an exception. If pilots struggle through check-\n     rides but pass, they are retested within two months instead \n     of the usual six or 12 months, Traub says.\n       If Express II had a policy of following struggling pilots \n     more closely, pilot Marvin Falitz, who crashed near Hibbing, \n     Minn., might have been weeded out. He failed three check-\n     rides--in 1988, 1992 and 1993. In 1987, he failed an oral \n     exam. Each time, Falitz was retrained and retested the same \n     day. Not surprisingly, he passed, and continued flying.\n       On two tests, he failed working with other pilots--what \n     investigators faulted him for in the crash.\n       Since the crash, Express has intensified pilot training. \n     ``Hibbing was an isolated incident and an unfortunate \n     incident,'' says Phil Reed, vice president of marketing. ``We \n     run a safe airline.''\n       After the crash, Northwest Airlines insisted that all of \n     its commuter partners, including Express, train to the \n     highest FAA standards.\n\n\n        firing: pilots are allowed to quit rather than be fired\n\n       Even when an airline decides a pilot is unfit to fly, the \n     pilot isn't always fired. Comair, a Delta Connection carrier, \n     didn't fire Michael Hillis. It let him resign. Hillis did and \n     started at American Eagle four days later.\n       Many U.S. airlines will let marginal pilots resign rather \n     than fire them. The reasons: Airlines fear being sued, and \n     problem pilots go away quicker if given an easy way out.\n       ``They're gone with fewer repercussions,'' says Southwest's \n     Sterbenz.\n       Letting pilots resign often puts them back in the cockpit--\n     of another airline. Still, airlines defend the practice. \n     ``The airlines are pretty diligent in looking out for those \n     people'' who have resigned, says Tom Bagley, vice president \n     of flight operations for Scenic Airlines.\n       Not always. American Eagle knew Hillis had resigned from \n     Comair. Hillis told Eagle he wanted to live in a different \n     city. But Eagle didn't know Hillis had been forced to resign. \n     Comair didn't provide that information, Eagle says, and the \n     FAA doesn't require airlines to pass on that information.\n       The reluctance to fire pilots goes beyond fear of lawsuits, \n     however. It is tied to the status and deference that pilots \n     enjoy and to the high cost of training new pilots.\n       ``Airlines carry weak pilots for long periods,'' says Diane \n     Damos, a University of Southern California aviation \n     psychologist. ``It's just part of the culture.''\n       Says aviation lawyer Arthur Wolk: ``It's aviation's good \n     old boy network. Nobody wants to trash a pilot.''\n       Co-pilot Kathleen Digan, 28, was given the benefit of the \n     doubt and later crashed a plane, killing herself and 11 \n     others. Digan was hired in 1987 by AVAir Inc., doing business \n     as American Eagle. She was flying a plane that crashed on \n     Feb. 19, 1988, in Raleigh-Durham, N.C.\n       During a check-ride her first year, the examiner said Digan \n     needed more work on landings. Another called her job \n     ``unsatisfactory'' and recommended she be fired. A captain \n     who flew with her said she ``overcontrolled'' the plane.\n       But Digan wasn't let go. AVAir's director of operations \n     defended the decision to keep her, telling investigators: \n     ``She had invested a lot in our company and our company had \n     invested a lot in her.''\n       Even the FAA has protected poor pilots. On Oct. 26, 1993, \n     three FAA employees died in a crash near Front Royal, Va. \n     Safety officials blamed Capt. Donald Robbins, 55.\n       That was no surprise. During his 10-year career, Robbins \n     flunked three FAA tests. He had two drunken-driving \n     convictions. Eight co-pilots avoided flying with him, and \n     several complained to supervisors. Nothing was done. In fact, \n     in Robbins' last evaluation, his supervisor gave him a \n     positive review and complimented him on his ability to ``get \n     along well with his fellow workers.''\n       The path pilots take to the cockpit: 1. Enter military or \n     civilian flight school. 2. Pass test to get private license; \n     can't work for hire. 3. Pass test to get commercial license; \n     can work for hire. 4. Many military pilots get jobs at \n     airlines after leaving military. Flight school pilots fly \n     cargo or work as instructors to build experience. 5. Get job \n     as co-pilot at regional airline. 6. Pass airline's training \n     program. 7. Pass test to fly certain type of plane. Testing \n     required each time a pilot switches to new type of plane. 8. \n     Spend first year on probation; get reviews; pass first-year \n     test. 9. Pass test to get air transport license; required to \n     become captain. 10. As captain, must pass medical and two \n     flight tests every year.\n       Regional airlines scramble for pilots. Growth in commuter \n     or ``regional'' air travel, coupled with a decrease in the \n     number of military-trained pilots, has forced airlines to \n     hire more pilots trained in civilian flight schools.\n       Military training fewer pilots 1992 3,742 1996 2,678(1).\n       Regional airline business soaring Passengers (in millions) \n     1984 26 1995 60(1).\n       Ranking salaries Average second-year pay for a regional \n     airline co-pilot, compared with the median pay for other \n     jobs: Secretary, $19,100; Phone operator, $19,100; Data entry \n     clerk, $17,150; Co-pilot, $15,600; Receptionist, $15,400; and \n     Bank teller, $14,600.\n       Comparing accident rates Accident rates for regional \n     airlines that fly planes with 30 or fewer seats are higher \n     than rates for regionals with bigger planes and major \n     airlines.

Mr. President, I reluctantly voted for the \nconference report for the Commerce, State, Justice appropriations bill, \nknowing that it will be vetoed, because it does contain many provisions \nthat will do significant good for the country and because much of the \nfunding it provides is very important to our efforts to fight violent \ncrime. I look forward to working with the managers of the bill to \nresolve the problem areas of this bill when it comes up for \nconsideration again.\n  Let me begin by outlining what is good in this bill. First, the \nprison litigation reform title of the bill makes important and needed \nchanges to the Federal laws governing lawsuits brought against prison \nadministrators across the country. Right now, in many jurisdictions, \njudicial orders entered under Federal law are having an enormously \ndestructive effect on public \n\n[[Page S 18296]]\nsafety and the administration of prisons. They are also raising the \ncosts of running prisons far beyond what is necessary. And they are \nundermining the legitimacy and punitive and deterrent effect of prison \nsentences.\n  These orders are complemented by a torrent of prisoner lawsuits. \nAlthough these suits are found nonmeritorious 95 percent of the time, \nthey occupy an enormous amount of State and local time and resources; \ntime and resources that would be better spent incarcerating more \ndangerous offenders.\n  In my own State of Michigan, the Federal courts are now monitoring \nour State prisons to determine:\n  First, how warm the food is.\n  Second, how bright the lights are.\n  Third, whether there are electrical outlets in each cell.\n  Fourth, whether windows are inspected and up to code.\n  Fifth, whether prisoners' hair is cut only by licensed barbers.\n  Sixth, whether air and water temperatures are comfortable.\n  Meanwhile, in Philadelphia, American citizens are put at risk every \nday by court decrees that curb prison crowding by declaring that we \nmust free dangerous criminals before they have served their time, or \nnot incarcerating other criminals at all. As a result, thousands of \ndefendants who were out on the streets because of these decrees have \nbeen rearrested for new crimes, including 79 murders, 959 robberies, \n2,215 drug dealing charges, 701 burglaries, 2,748 thefts, 90 rapes, and \n1,113 assaults in just 1 year. Obviously, these judicial decrees pose \nan enormous threat to public safety.\n  Finally, in addition to massive judicial interventions in State \nprison systems, we also have frivolous inmate litigation brought under \nFederal law. Thirty three States have estimated that this litigation \ncost them at least $54.5 million annually. The National Association of \nAttorneys General have concluded that this means that nationwide the \ncosts are at least $81.3 million. Since, according to their \ninformation, more than 95 percent of these suits are dismissed without \nthe inmate receiving anything, the vast majority of this money is being \nentirely wasted.\n  Title VIII of this conference report contains important measures that \nwill help stop the destructive effect on public safety, the unnecessary \nmicromanagement, and the waste of resources that this litigation is \ncausing. It limits intervention into the affairs of State prisons by \nany court, State or Federal, undertaken under Federal law, to narrowly \ntailored orders necessary to protect the inmates' constitutional \nrights. It also makes it very difficult for any court to enter an order \ndirecting the release of prisoners. Finally, it contains a number of \nvery important limitations on prisoner lawsuits.\n  These provisions are based on legislation that I have worked on \nassiduously along with the distinguished chairman of the Judiciary \nCommittee, Senator Hatch, the majority leader, and Senators Hutchison \nand Kyl. They have the strong support of the National Association of \nAttorneys General and the National District Attorneys Association. They \nwill make an important contribution to public safety and the orderly \nrunning of prisons by the State officials charged with running them \nwithout unnecessary Federal interference. And they will help limit the \nwaste of taxpayer money now spent defending frivolous lawsuits and \nfeeding prisoners' sense that as a result of committing a crime, they \nhave a grievance with the world, rather than the other way around.\n  I thank the appropriators in both Houses, as well as the efforts of \nthe majority leader and the chairman of the Judiciary Committee, for \nseeing to it that these provisions were included in this legislation.\n  The second reason I support this bill is that it makes significant \nimprovements in the law governing the funding of prison grants to the \nStates. Although styled truth-in-sentencing grants, the language in \npresent law is so full of loopholes that it does little to advance the \ncause of incarcerating the most violent offenders or assuring that they \nwould actually serve the time they were sentenced to serve. The new \nversion does a much better job of targeting this money in a manner that \ncreates the proper incentives.\n  Now let me outline the areas of this bill with which I have serious \nreservations. First, I believe the bill goes too far in diffusing money \nthat the version of this legislation that passed the Senate had \ndedicated to the hiring of police officers in the COPS Program. I \nsympathize with the desire of my colleagues in the House to give the \nStates more flexibility in spending this money, but this could mean \nthat our goal to put more police on the street may not be achieved. I \nwould much prefer to see a system where the States do have additional \nflexibility, but are given some real incentives to spend the money \nhiring additional law enforcement officers.\n  Second, Mr. President, I believe the provisions related to the \nCommerce Department fall short of what we should be doing--namely \neliminating the Commerce Department altogether. I am the lead Senate \nsponsor of legislation to abolish the Department of Commerce, S. 929. I \nthink the record is clear--the Department of Commerce is the least \nessential of all 14 Cabinet-level agencies. Any effort to reorganize \nand reform Government should begin there.\n  Although this bill does not eliminate the umbrella organization of \nthe Commerce Department, it does reduce and eliminate some of the \nDepartment's more indefensible programs and agencies. It terminates \ncorporate welfare programs like the Advanced Technology Program and the \nU.S. Travel and Tourism Administration, and it establishes procedures \nby which the Administration can act.\n  On the other hand, the conference report fails to take a strong \nposition toward indefensible programs like the Economic Development \nAdministration. Whereas the Senate had funded this program at only $89 \nbillion, the report before us would provide the EDA with over $300 \nbillion for next year. Given the EDA's record of waste and abuse, I \nbelieve this funding is excessive and I look forward to an opportunity \nto debate the merits of the EDA, and other programs like it, when my \nbill to terminate the Commerce Department is debated on the Senate \nfloor. In addition, this report deletes the fund to cover the costs of \nterminating the Department and transferring necessary functions to \nother areas of the Government. Various concerns have been raised \nregarding the cost of terminating the Department of Commerce, and this \nprovision would have helped address those concerns.\n  I think some of the money being spent on these unnecessary programs \nin the Commerce Department would have been better spent funding Federal \nlaw enforcement at the levels the Senate proposed in the pre-conference \nversion of this legislation.\n  Finally, this conference report accepted the House funding level for \nlegal services for the poor and maintains the existing structure for \nthe provision of these services, the Legal Services Corporation, albeit \nwith provisions seeking to ensure that some of the worst misallocations \nof funds that the Corporation has permitted do not recur. As I \nexplained when the issue came before the Senate originally in \nconnection with this bill, I believe the approach the Senate \nsubcommittee took to this issue originally, which would have eliminated \nthe Federal Corporation and block-granted to the States Federal funds \nfor the provision of legal services to the poor, was far superior. The \nCorporation itself provides no legal services to the poor, but rather \ngrants Federal money to local organizations that give legal assistance \nto the poor. This is a function the States can perform at least as \neffectively as the Corporation has.\n  While I voted for this conference report, I will reserve judgment on \nthe next Commerce, State, Justice appropriations bill.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/12/08/senate-section/article/S18295-2", "month": "12", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "08", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S18296-S18297]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n     THE COMMERCE, STATE, JUSTICE APPROPRIATIONS CONFERENCE REPORT\n\n Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I rise in strong opposition to \nthe Commerce-Justice-State appropriations conference report.\n  When this bill was adopted by the Senate on September 29, it \nmaintained the Community Oriented Policing Services Program [COPS] by \neliminating the State and Local Law Enforcement Assistance Block Grant \nProgram, reinstated the Legal Services Corporation, and fully funded \nthe Violence \n\n[[Page S 18297]]\nAgainst Women Act. Now this appropriations bill returns to the Senate \nreflecting the wishes of the House at the expense of the Senate. The \nCOPS Program has been eliminated by the re-instatement of the State and \nLocal Law Enforcement Assistance Block Grant Program, the Legal \nServices Corporation will receive approximately $60 million less than \nthe Senate had agreed upon, and the Violence Against Women Act will \nalso receive approximately $40 million less than what the Senate agreed \nupon.\n  As we all know, the COPS Program has proven to be successful. In one \nyear, since the program's inception, New Mexico has received over 180 \nofficers from the COPS Program. All parts of New Mexico have been \nawarded officer positions. From the Aztec Police Department in the \nnorth and Sunland Park in the South, to Quay County in the east and \nLaguna Pueblo in the west, all have felt the impact of this program.\n  The COPS Program is different from the block grant contained in the \nconference report because it emphasizes the concept of community \npolicing. It gets officers out into the community preventing crimes \nrather than reacting to crimes once they have been committed.\n  Mr. President, I understand that the language in this appropriations \nbill would allow a community to use the block grant money to hire \nsecretaries, buy a radar gun or buy a floodlight for a local jail. The \nlaw enforcement community is against this broad approach. The sentiment \nis best summed up by Donald L. Cahill, the chairman of the national \nlegislative committee for the Fraternal Order of Police, who testified \nbefore the Senate Judiciary Committee in February on the block grant \ntype proposal. He stated:\n\n       This broader category opens the door to using these funds \n     for numerous purposes other than hiring police officers--such \n     as hiring prosecutors or judges, buying equipment, lighting \n     streets, or whatever. These are all worthwhile--but they \n     won't arrest a single criminal.\n\n  The bottom line is to place more officers on the street and the COPS \nprogram has proven to be successful. That is why the Fraternal Order of \nPolice, the National Sheriffs' Association, and the National Troopers' \nCoalition support the COPS Program.\n  To quote Mr. Cahill again, ``Police are the answer for today and \nprevention is the answer for tomorrow.''\n  If the Senate agrees to fund the Violence Against Women Act at the \nfigure contained in the conference report, the Senate is stating that \nthis program is not as strong a priority as it was on September 29.\n  If given the resources, this act has the potential to demonstrate \nthat the Federal Government can make a real difference when dealing \nwith violence against women. Through prosecution, outreach, and \neducation, the Federal Government has assumed the responsibility of a \nfull partner in this cause.\n  In summary, our communities will suffer the direct affects of these \nmisaligned priorities.\n  Mr. President, I would like to take a few additional minutes to \ndiscuss some other areas of the conference report that have led me to \noppose the bill.\n  I want to preface my comments with a reminder to those who are \nearnestly committed to the future economic well-being of our Nation and \nour citizens. Balancing the budget is certainly a goal I support; this \ncause does make sense, but that goal alone is not enough to secure a \nrobust and healthy economic future for our country. How we cut, what we \ncut matters a great deal. As many of you know, I have watched rather \nincredulously as aid to dependent children, student loans, Medicare and \nMedicaid, the earned income tax credit have been slashed and attacked \nin this Chamber as we proceed, without missing a beat, to provide \nnearly $800 million on 129 military construction projects above the \nPentagon's request, above what the President of the United States \nproposed was necessary to maintain the national security interests of \nthe country. We are making tough decisions that affect people's lives \nand impact the ability of so many who are hard-working, low income \nAmericans to keep their families together, keep food on the table, and \nhave a chance at getting their children into colleges.\n  What we cut matters, and I am opposed to the decimation of our \nNation's technology programs. Our firms are at a distinct disadvantage \nto firms in Germany, France, Israel, Japan, South Korea, and in nearly \nall industrialized nations when it comes to making the investments \nrequired to match what foreign government-industry partnerships provide \nfor pre-competitive technology support. We have achieved laudable and \nsignificant results from the Technology Reinvestment Program, the \nAdvanced Technology Program, and the Manufacturing Extension Program. \nWhile we cut programs, even eliminate some--the Office of Technology \nAssessment, for example, no longer exists--the Japanese Government \ndespite its budget and economic problems is going to double its \nresearch and development expenditures by the year 2000. Our technology \nprograms are not corporate welfare; these have been programs that have \nhelped trigger the competitive rebound of our Nation's firms and that \nhave helped small and medium-sized firms benefit from national \ntechnology programs and projects, that would have otherwise been the \nexclusive privilege of larger firms with the contacts, resources, and \ninfrastructure to cooperate with national laboratories.\n  This Commerce-Justice-State appropriations bill is a disturbing \nideological exercise that threatens the health of our future economy. \nThe technology programs of the Department of Commerce help to expand \nour economy, help Americans compete in the global marketplace, and help \nto generate high-quality, high-wage jobs that our workers need. Many \nsay that the reason that the Advanced Technology Program is being \neliminated is that the projects did not earn any political ownership. \nThis is a sad commentary on our judgment of what is important and not \nimportant as we make decisions in our budget-cutting efforts. As Leslie \nHelm of the Los Angeles Times wrote on November 26, 1995:\n\n       The Advanced Technology Program . . . works because \n     projects are proposed by industry and companies are required \n     to match government money on their own.\n\n  This is an example of how we should be leveraging the taxpayer's \ndollar, getting more from government investments than we otherwise \nwould achieve. The ATP was created during the Bush administration and \nhad strong bipartisan support, support that such a promising, \nsuccessful program should have today.\n  I also cannot support this bill because of the sharp reduction for \nthe National Information Infrastructure Grants Program. The NII Program \nassists hospitals, schools, libraries, and local governments in \nprocuring advanced communications equipment to provide better health \ncare, education, and local government services. The conference report \neliminates funding for the GLOBE Program, which promotes knowledge of \nscience and the environment in our schools. And although it remains \nanemically funded, I think that the reductions in this bill for the \nManufacturing Extension Program are wrong-headed and continue the trend \nof undermining our Nation's best efforts in decades at partnering with \nindustry to maintain our national technological competitiveness both in \nthe commercial and national defense sectors.\n  We need to bias our spending toward those projects that produce real \ngrowth in our economy. Growth generates jobs, better incomes, and a \nhigher standard of living for our citizens.\n  For these reasons, Mr. President, I must strongly oppose this bill \nand urge the President to veto it.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/12/08/senate-section/article/S18296-1", "month": "12", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "08", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S18297-S18298]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          SPEEDY SENATE RATIFICATION OF START II IS NECESSARY\n\n Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, Wednesday Senator Bingaman gave an \nimportant statement about the necessity to ratify START II quickly, and \nI would like to add my voice in support of his position.\n  START II will cut the number of the world's nuclear weapons in half, \ngetting rid of nearly 4,000 deployed H-bombs in Russia and about the \nsame number here. An overwhelming number of our citizens favor \nimplementing this treaty, and a large number of elected officials on \nboth sides of the aisle have expressed their support for it. Names and \nstatements of support by Republican leaders were read by my friend from \nNew Mexico, and I will not take time to add to this list now. \n\n[[Page S 18298]]\n\n  Apparently START II is being held hostage in a dispute over the \nconsolidation of our foreign affairs agencies. I hope this is not the \ncase.\n  Even worse, some groups are now calling to add certain conditions for \nratifying START II. These conditions have all been discussed in bills \nthat have now passed the Senate, and should not be attached to the \nratification of a treaty. The Senate can not change START II, either we \nratify it or not. Attaching political conditions on a treaty is a \ndangerous practice and should be avoided on procedural considerations.\n  Mr. President, START II should be ratified for many reasons. First, \nSTART II destroys weapons. This reduces the risk of an accidental \nlaunch. Second, every Russian weapon destroyed is a weapon we don't \nneed to defend against. The following table shows the numbers and kinds \nof ICBMs that can be eliminated under START II.\n  I ask that it be printed in the Record.\n  The table follows:\n\n       INTERNATIONAL BALLISTIC MISSILES--ELIMINATED UNDER START II      \n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                Delivery system                  Launchers     Warheads \n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nSS-18.........................................          188        1,880\nSS-19.........................................      \\1\\ 170        1,020\nSS-24.........................................           46          460\nSLBM's........................................  ...........      \\2\\ 600\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n    Totals....................................          304       3,960 \n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\\1\\ Some SS-19's may be converted to carry only a single warhead in     \n  order to offset the cost of developing a new launcher.                \n\\2\\ Based on limit of 1,750 submarine launched ballistic missiles. The  \n  current Russian arsenal of SLBM's is estimated at 2,350.              \n                                                                        \n  Source: ``Bulletin of Atomic Scientists,'' Nuclear Notebook, September/\n  October 1995.                                                         \n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Additionally, destroying weapons saves taxpayers' money. \nJust look at the current Senate Defense authorization bill. As my \nfriend from New Mexico pointed out in the report to the Defense \nAuthorization Act, the act ``proposes a nuclear weapons manufacturing \ncomplex sized to meet a need of a hedge stockpile far above the active \nSTART II stockpile of 3500 weapons.'' The total cost of producing our \nnuclear weapons to date is about $4 trillion. Compare that with our $5 \ntrillion national debt. In 1995 alone, $12.4 billion was spent to \nbuild, operate and maintain strategic nuclear weapons. If we ratify \nSTART II we can give taxpayers the double peace dividend of higher \nsecurity at lower cost.\n  Even if START II were fully implemented, we would have more than \n3,000 deployed strategic missiles--500 warheads on missiles in silos, \n1,680 warheads on submarine-launched missiles, and 1,320 on airplanes. \nFurthermore, an additional 4,000 nuclear weapons would remain in our \nstockpile. Surely, this will be more than enough atomic fire power to \ncounter any conceivable threat to the United States.\n  Mr. President, Russia and other former Soviet Republics are more open \nthan ever before. We have all seen the unprecedented pictures on \ntelevision of Russian missiles and airplanes being destroyed. This new \nopenness will make START II even more verifiable then START I. With \nRussian elections this month and our own presidential election season \njust starting, we must act now to keep the this olive branch from \nwithering.\n  In conclusion, Mr. President, we need to ratify START II quickly. It \nis not in the national interest to play politics over the ratification \nof any treaty. Russian President Yeltsin is ill and needs quick \nAmerican ratification of START II to help get the Russian Parliament to \nratify it. We need the security of fewer Russian warheads now. We need \nto stop spending so much money making our nuclear weapons now. We can \nuse the warheads we have now to defend America. We need to ratify START \nII now.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/12/08/senate-section/article/S18297-1", "month": "12", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "08", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S18298]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  THE PASSING OF THOMAS L. WASHINGTON\n\n Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, it is with great, personal sadness \nthat I note the passing this Tuesday, December 5 of Thomas L. \nWashington. Tom was a personal friend, a valued supporter, a concerned \nhusband and father, and a dedicated leader in his community.\n  Tom was an avid and renowned sportsman. He exemplified all that is \ngood about the sportsman: he was hardy and self-reliant; he also was \nfrugal with and respectful of our great outdoors. Tom loved Michigan's \nwetlands and forests. He spent time in them, enjoying them and working \nto preserve them.\n  Because he loved the outdoors, Tom founded and led the Michigan \nUnited Conservation Clubs. Indeed, he built that organization into the \nlargest single State conservancy in the Nation.\n  Tom was a strong, committed advocate for preserving Michigan's \noutdoors, and also the great outdoors of America and beyond, for all to \nenjoy.\n  He served on the board of directors of Safari Club International and \nthe National Wildlife Federation. True sportsman that he was, he was as \nconcerned to preserve the environment for future generations as to \nenjoy it for himself.\n  Thus he helped draft legislation creating the Michigan Natural \nResources Trust Fund. This fund purchases prime recreational lands for \npublic use with royalties from oil, gas, and mineral production on \nState lands. In 1976 Tom was appointed a charter member of the board \nthat administers the fund. He served on the board until his death, \nincluding several terms as chairman.\n  He served on a number of Michigan State committees, including the \ncommittee that wrote administrative rules for the Michigan Farmland and \nOpen Space Preservation Act, which is central to the State's land-use \nprogram.\n  Tom also served on the Governor's Interim Committee on Environmental \nEducation, the Michigan Department of Natural Resources Endangered \nSpecies Committee, and the Governor's Interim Committee on \nEnvironmental Education. And he served as vice chairman of the \nGovernor's Michigan Land Inventory Committee.\n  He was a recipient of the American Motors Conservation Award, Safari \nClub International's Chairman's Award, and the Miles D. Pirnie Award \nfor his leadership in preserving wetlands and wetlands wildlife.\n  Part of the reason for Tom's care for the environment no doubt \nstemmed from the fact that he was a family man. He cared about his wife \nand children and wanted to pass on to them the same rights and the same \nopportunities that he enjoyed.\n  A hunter concerned to protect all our rights, he also fought for the \nsecond amendment.\n  Tom was elected president of NRA's board of directors in 1994 and \nreelected in 1995. First elected to the board of directors in 1985, Tom \nserved as second and then first vice president prior to being elected \npresident.\n  Tom worked for responsible use of our rights, working with training \nand informational programs along with second amendment defense.\n  He was a fine man, whom I personally shall miss. I extend my \ncondolences to the Washington family.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/12/08/senate-section/article/S18298-1", "month": "12", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "08", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S18298-S18302]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 RATIFY THE CHEMICAL WEAPONS CONVENTION\n\n Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, the Chemical Weapons Convention \n[CWC] is a watershed agreement that will eliminate an entire class of \nweapons of mass destruction. Upon ratification, the CWC calls for the \ncomplete elimination of all chemical weapons within 10 years.\n  This landmark treaty is perhaps the most comprehensive arms control \nagreement ever signed. To begin with, the Chemical Weapons Convention \nrequires all signatories to begin destruction of their chemical weapons \nstockpiles within 1 year of ratification, and to complete this \ndestruction within 10 years. In addition, the CWC prohibits the \nproduction, use and distribution of this class of weapons, and provides \nan intrusive international monitoring organization in order to prevent \nthe development of these weapons.\n  This verification allows not only for the inspection of ``declared'' \nsites, but also permits international inspectors access to any \nsuspected undeclared facilities. Signatories do not have the right of \nrefusal to deter inspection. Should a member nation request a \n``challenge inspection'' of a suspected chemical facility, the nation \ncalled into question must permit the inspectors to enter the country \nwithin 12 hours. Within another 12 hours, the inspectors must have been \nallowed entry into the suspected warehouse. It is very unlikely that \nevery trace of the banned chemicals could be eliminated within 24 \nhours. \n\n[[Page S 18299]]\n\n  In addition to providing broader powers to an international \ninspection regime, the CWC includes strong punishment to those nations \nwho choose to violate this agreement. The violating nation, as well as \nnonmember nations, could no longer purchase an entire group of \nchemicals from member nations. The chemicals which would be banned are \nnecessary for factories to produce products such as pesticides, \nplastics, and pharmaceuticals. So this measure is not only a ``carrot'' \nto induce nations to join, but a ``stick'' to ensure their compliance.\n  Obviously, Mr. President, no treaty is 100 percent watertight, but \nthe strength of the international monitoring regime, the Organization \nfor the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons, makes the manufacture of \nchemical weapons difficult to conceal, and the punishment provides a \nstrong deterrent to developing this class of weapons.\n  Among all weapons of mass destruction--biological, chemical, and \nnuclear--chemical weapons are the most plausible and potent threat \navailable to terrorists. These chemical weapons are relatively easy to \nmake, and a dosage that can kill thousands is very easy to conceal. \nRecent events in Tokyo and Oklahoma City have provided the wake-up call \nto the international community, showing that the world can no longer \nslumber in a blanket of false security.\n  From a historical perspective, agreements to curtail chemical weapons \nuse have been largely successful. The best example is the 1925 Geneva \nProtocol. Even during World War II, the vast majority of nations \nobserved the Geneva Protocol, which banned the first-use of chemical \nweapons in war. However, the use of chemical weapons by Saddam Hussein \nagainst Iran and the Iraqi Kurdish population forced the world \ncommunity to realize the danger of these weapons. The production of \nchemical weapons by nations facilitates the proliferation of these \nweapons to state sponsored terrorist groups.\n  The United States must place a high priority on the elimination of \nthis deadly class of weapons. If the United States wishes to retain its \nposition as a world leader, the Senate must provide its advice and \nconsent to the ratification of the Chemical Weapons Convention with \nurgency, and persuade other nations to follow our lead.\n  Mr. President, to call attention to the proliferation of weapons of \nmass destruction, I would recommend a highly informative article by \nRobert Wright entitled ``Be Very Afraid'', which appeared in the May 1, \n1995 edition of The New Republic. To Quote Mr. Wright:\n\n       All told, the world's current policy on weapons of mass \n     destruction can be summarized as follows: The more terrible \n     and threatening the weapon, the less we do about it. There \n     has never been a more opportune time to rethink these \n     priorities. * * * A good model for reform exists in the \n     Chemical Weapons Convention, which now awaits ratification \n     after more than a decade of negotiation involving three \n     administrations. The CWC has both kinds of teeth that the NPT \n     lacks: A tough inspection regime and real punishment for \n     violation.\n\n  I ask that the text of the article be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                  [From the New Republic, May 1, 1995]\n\n          Nukes, Nerve Gas and Anthrax Spores--Be Very Afraid\n\n                           (By Robert Wright)\n\n       Once you've assimilated the idea that an apocalyptic new-\n     age cult with offices on three continents had stockpiled tons \n     of nerve-gas ingredients and was trying to cultivate the \n     bacterial toxin that causes botulism, the rest of the story \n     is pretty good news. The cult, Aum Supreme Truth, employed \n     its nerve gas on only one of the continents, rather than aim \n     for synchronized gassings of the Tokyo, New York and Moscow \n     subways. Only a small fraction of its chemical stock was \n     used, and that was prepared shoddily; the gas seems to have \n     been a degraded version of sarin, and the ``delivery \n     systems'' the emitted it were barely worthy of that name. \n     Rather than thousands dead on three continents we got eleven \n     dead on one. A happy ending.\n       On the other hand, a worldwide display of well-run chemical \n     and biological terrorism would have had its virtues. From \n     mid-April through mid-May, on the eve of the Nuclear Non-\n     proliferation Treaty's expiration at age 25, representatives \n     of more than 170 nations are meeting in New York to vote on \n     renewing the treaty. Conceivably, this gala event could \n     inspire a broader and much-needed dialogue on the state of \n     the world's efforts to control weapons of mass destruction, \n     including chemical and biological arms. Then again, \n     conceivably it couldn't. So far attempts to take a truly \n     fresh look at this issue have tended to encounter a certain \n     dull inertia within policy-making circles. This is the sort \n     of condition for which 10,000 globally televised deaths on \n     three continents might have been just the cure.\n       One salient feature of the world's approach to weapons of \n     mass destruction is perverseness. The Nuclear Non-\n     proliferation Treaty--the NPT--is a much weaker document than \n     the recently negotiated Chemical Weapons convention, which \n     now awaits American ratification; yet nuclear weapons are \n     much more devastating than chemical ones. Meanwhile, \n     biological weapons are essentially devoid of international \n     control, yet they're the scariest of the three. They may \n     not be the most potent--not for now, at least--but they \n     have the greatest combination of potency and plausibility. \n     If someone asks you to guess which technology will be the \n     first to kill 100,000 Americans in a terrorist incident, \n     you shouldn't hesitate; bet on biotechnology. And not \n     futuristic, genetically engineered, genocidal viruses, \n     though these may be along eventually. Plain old first-\n     generation biological weapons--the same vintage as the \n     ones Aum Supreme Truth was trying to make--are the great \n     unheralded threat to national security in the late 1990s.\n       All told, the planet's current policy on weapons of mass \n     destruction can be summarized as follows: the more terrible \n     and threatening the weapon, the less we do about it. There \n     has never been a more opportune time to rethink these \n     priorities.\n\n\n                                   I\n\n       To its credit, the Clinton administration has lately worked \n     doggedly on behalf of NPT renewal. Officials have traveled \n     the globe, reminding world leaders that they're more secure \n     with the treaty than without it, and promising the more \n     ambivalent ones God-knows-what in exchange for their support. \n     The treaty now seems assured of extension before the New York \n     conference adjourns.\n       Extension is certainly better than non-extension. Still, \n     since its inception back in the 1960s, the treaty's \n     structural weakness has gotten sufficiently glaring that one \n     wishes those weren't the only two options.\n       The idea behind the treaty was that the nuclear haves--\n     Britain, China, France, Russia, the United States--would buy \n     off the have-nots. The have-nots would pledge not to acquire \n     nuclear weapons, and the haves would help them get and \n     maintain nuclear energy for peaceful use. That was the \n     carrot. Once the have-nots had signed on, they would be \n     subjected (along with the rest of us) to the stick: \n     international inspection of nuclear reactors, with the \n     understanding that misuse of the technology would lead to its \n     cutoff. Administering both carrot and stick is the \n     International Atomic Energy Agency, or IAEA.\n       One oddity of this arrangement is that the IAEA's job is to \n     relentlessly complicate its own life. As it helps spread \n     ``peaceful'' nuclear materials around the globe, \n     opportunities for illicit use multiply, and so does the need \n     for stringent policing. Thus, the world must get better and \n     better at two things: detecting cheaters, and punishing them \n     with sufficient force to deter others. Recent events show the \n     world to have failed in both regards.\n       At the outset of the Persian Gulf war, Iraq was an NPT \n     member in technically good standing. After the war, the world \n     discovered what a meaningless fact that can be. Indeed, as if \n     to drive home the IAEA's impotence, a separate agency, under \n     United Nations auspices, went into Iraq, documented the \n     nuclear weapons program and dismantled it.\n       It's true that the existence of this program didn't come as \n     a bolt from the blue. There had long been grave suspicions, \n     but President Bush's aversion to regional Iranian hegemony \n     had given him a certain tolerance for Iraqi excesses. Still, \n     few suspected the scope of Saddam Hussein's nuclear program, \n     or the subtlety of its concealment. Hussein proved that the \n     IAEA's inspection regime--confined to declared nuclear \n     sites--is inadequate.\n       The first application of this lesson was in North Korea. \n     After inspection of a declared site revealed nuclear \n     materials to be missing, the IAEA, for the first time ever, \n     asked to look at an undeclared site. The North Korean refusal \n     confirmed everyone's worst suspicions, and thus revealed a \n     second NPT deficiency: once the world knows something fishy \n     is going on, there are no provisions for assured and \n     effective punishment. In theory the IAEA could appeal to the \n     U.N. Security Council for economic sanctions--or, indeed, for \n     the authorization of air strikes against the suspect \n     facility. But often this channel will be blocked by a Big \n     Five veto--possibly China's in the case of North Korea, \n     perhaps Russia's in some future case involving Iran. Of \n     course, the IAEA can stop all further shipment of nuclear \n     materials to outlaw nations. But it may be too late for that \n     tack to keep the bomb out of their hands, and any adverse \n     effect on their energy supply wouldn't be felt for a while.\n       Notwithstanding these flaws, the NPT has been pretty \n     effective. Nobody called John Kennedy an hysteric when in \n     1963 he predicted that within a dozen years fifteen to twenty \n     nations would have the bomb. Yet now, thirty-two years later, \n     the best guess is that eight nations have a functioning \n     bomb--the Big Five within the NPT and, outside of it, Israel, \n     Pakistan and India. (In \n\n[[Page S 18300]]\n     addition, Ukraine, Belarus and Kazakhstan were born with the bomb, and \n     say they'll give it up.) A primary reason for this glacial \n     pace is that the NPT eased fears, in large chunks of the \n     world, about the imminent nuclearization of neighbors.\n       Still, the Middle East and south Asia have gotten arms-race \n     fever since 1963, and North Korea may yet start a race in the \n     Pacific. So it would be nice to make the NPT more seductive \n     and effective: to raise both the benefits of signing and the \n     costs of reneging. And, though no one is talking about using \n     the present conference to amend the NPT (this would \n     supposedly open up various cans of worms) there is talk of \n     reaching that goal in other ways. For example, the IAEA can \n     interpret its sometimes-ambiguous mandate broadly--as it did \n     in claiming the right to inspect undeclared sites in North \n     Korea--and hope everyone goes along, thus setting a \n     precedent. Or the agency can approach member nations \n     collectively about a generic rewrite of their individual \n     ``safeguard agreements,'' the documents, technically separate \n     from the NPT, which grant the IAEA's power to inspect. In any \n     event, if NPT extension happens early enough in New York, \n     there will be time for the conference at least to open a \n     dialogue about the grave flaws of the current regime.\n\n\n                                   ii\n\n       A good rough model for reform exists in the Chemical \n     Weapons Convention, which now awaits Senate ratification \n     after more than a decade of negotiation involving three \n     administrations. The CWC has both kinds of teeth that the NPT \n     lacks: a tough inspection regime and real punishment for \n     violation. In the arms-control field, says Berry Kellman, a \n     law professor at DePaul University, it is a ``wholly \n     unprecedented document of international law.'' Were it \n     already in effect, Aum Supreme Truth's attempt to make \n     chemical weapons would have been a lot harder.\n       Under the chemical convention, the Organization for the \n     Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (or OPCW, the CWC's version \n     of the IAEA), would be routinely informed about the \n     commercial transfer of substances used to make chemical \n     weapons--and substances used to make substances that are in \n     turn used to make chemical weapons. That covers dozens and \n     dozens of substances. It also covers a lot of sellers and \n     buyers, because those substances tend to have legitimate uses \n     as well. Thiodiglycol is used to make both mustard gas and \n     ballpointpen ink. Dimethylamine makes for good nerve gas and \n     detergent. In an impressive balancing act, CWC negotiators \n     managed to craft a system that (a) monitors the sale and \n     transport of these chemicals and entails periodic \n     inspections; and (b) has the unambiguous support of the \n     Chemical Manufacturers Association.\n       Unlike the NPT, the CWC goes well beyond this inspection of \n     ``declared'' sites--factories that avowedly employ the \n     suspect chemicals--and provides explicitly for the inspection \n     of undeclared sites. And here things can happen pretty fast. \n     If the United States request a ``challenge inspection'' of, \n     say, a suspicious-looking warehouse in Iran (a signatory), \n     Iran must let inspectors into its country within twelve hours \n     of being notified. After another twelve hours, it must have \n     escorted the inspectors to the perimeter of the warehouse. \n     (eliminating every trace of chemical weapons manufacture \n     within twenty-four hours is considered quite unlikely.) At \n     this point there can be up to ninety-six hours of \n     negotiations about which parts of the warehouse are subject \n     to inspection. But any vehicles leaving the area in the \n     meanwhile can be searched.\n       A country could conceivably keep this standoff going longer \n     by arguing that a search warrant at the national level is \n     required. Indeed, it might even be telling the truth (though \n     for chemical factories, already subject to government \n     regulation, this excuse wouldn't wash). And, what's more, \n     such a warrant might wind up being truly unobtainable--if, \n     for example, the requested search were of your indoor tennis \n     court and the OPCW could provide no evidence of illegal \n     activity there. Still, if such appeals to national \n     sovereignty had an overpoweringly phone air, the country \n     could be deemed in noncompliance with the treaty by a vote of \n     OPCW member-states.\n       Nations so deemed would truly be put in the dog-house. \n     There is a whole slew of substances relevant to chemical \n     warfare that treaty violators could no longer buy from OPCW \n     members, a group that would include roughly the whole \n     industrialized world. And the cutoff of these substances \n     could harm factories that make things ranging from \n     pesticides to plastics to ceramics to pharmaceuticals.\n       Here the CWC breaks momentously new ground, though less by \n     design than by technological happenstance. Because of the \n     flexibility of chemical technology, the treaty's punishment \n     by denial of ``military'' chemicals amounts to broad and \n     immediately painful sanctions against the civilian economy. \n     And these sanctions are a good reason not just to stay in \n     compliance, but to sign the treaty in the first place. If you \n     don't join the OPCW, its members--just about everybody--won't \n     sell you these chemicals in the first place. That's a carrot; \n     and that's a stick.\n       Obviously, no weapons control regime can be foolproof. \n     (That's why, notwithstanding the NPT's high-minded call for \n     the eventual elimination of all the Earth's nuclear weapons, \n     this won't happen anytime soon. A few powerful but reasonably \n     responsible nations must preserve a nuclear arsenal, lest the \n     next, slightly wilier version of Saddam Hussein be empowered \n     to hold the world hostage with half a dozen warheads, or \n     other weapons of mass destruction.) Still, the CWC, given the \n     complexity it confronts, would have a good chance of success. \n     It would make the manufacture of chemical weapons an endeavor \n     with a significant risk of unmasking, and unmasking would \n     bring painful penalties--penalties that no Security Council \n     member would have the chance to veto. If the NPT had the \n     CWC's built-in vigilance, Hussein would have found it much \n     harder to reach the point he reached and still retain NPT \n     membership. And if the NPT had the CWC's membership benefits, \n     it would be much harder for any nation--Iraq, Israel, India, \n     Pakistan--to bear the prospect of nonmembership.\n       The irony in this disparity between the NPT and the CWC is \n     that nuclear weapons are much more devastating than chemical \n     weapons. Japanese newspapers estimated that Aum Supreme \n     Truth's many tons of chemicals could theoretically cause 4 \n     million deaths, but the key word here is ``theoretically.'' \n     This calculation assumes that the poison gas is spread with \n     perfect efficiency, so that every bit gets breathed by \n     someone and no one breathes more than his or her share (a lot \n     to ask of a dying subway rider). More reasonable figures \n     would be in the hundreds of thousands.\n       And even those numbers are inflated. If you discovered a \n     cache of 800,000 bullets, you might say this was enough to \n     kill 500,000 people, even allowing for inefficient \n     application. But inefficiency is only half the problem; \n     fairly early in the application process you'd attract \n     official resistance. So, too, with chemical weapons. Whereas \n     converting a single nuclear bomb into 500,000 deaths is a \n     simple matter of parking a van and setting a timer, \n     converting a single chemical weapon into 500,000 deaths isn't \n     even remotely possible. A thousand deaths is more like it. \n     Racking up large numbers means mounting a well-orchestrated \n     campaign.\n       This doesn't mean chemical weapons don't warrant the tight \n     treatment they get in the CWC. For one thing, some of them, \n     such as skin-melting and often nonlethal mustard gas, have \n     uniquely horrifying effects. Second, although a single \n     chemical weapons possesses a tiny fraction of a nuclear \n     bomb's lethality, chemical weapons are much easier to get. \n     The recipe for making them is public, a first-rate chemistry \n     major can follow it (if at some health risk), and the \n     ingredients grow more widely available each decade.\n       Besides, chemical weapons, though the least massively \n     destructive weapon of mass destruction, are much more potent \n     than conventional explosives. A conventional warhead might \n     kill ten people in a suburban neighborhood where a chemical \n     warhead could kill 100. The Iraqi chemical arsenal discovered \n     after the Persian Gulf war--100,000 artillery shells, \n     warheads and bombs--was theoretically enough to wipe out the \n     entire Israeli population many, many times over. It is with \n     good reason that chemical weapons are put in a special class \n     of global abhorrence and regulation, along with nuclear and \n     biological weapons.\n       Still, chemical weapons aren't nearly as pernicious as \n     nuclear weapons. And what most people still don't understand \n     is that in important respects nuclear weapons aren't as \n     pernicious as biological weapons.\n\n\n                                  iii\n\n       In one sense, biological weapons are commonly \n     overestimated. People tend to assume they work by starting \n     epidemics, when in fact most biological weapons kill by \n     direct exposure, just like chemical weapons. To be sure, \n     contagious weapons exist. American settlers purposefully gave \n     Native Americans blankets infested with smallpox; more \n     recently, both American and Soviet military researchers have \n     experimented with some readily transmittable viruses. Still, \n     in general, contagious weapons have a way of coming back to \n     haunt the aggressor. So biological weaponry this century has \n     involved mainly things like anthrax spores, which enter your \n     lungs and hatch bacteria that multiply within your body and \n     finally kill you, but don't infest anyone else in the \n     meanwhile.\n       Genetic engineering may eventually make contagious weapons \n     more likely. In principle, for example, one could design a \n     virus that would disproportionately afflict members of a \n     particular ethnic group, thus giving some measure of safety \n     to attackers of other ethnic persuasions. And--more \n     realistically in the near term--genetic engineering makes it \n     easier to match a killer virus with an effective vaccine, so \n     that the aggressor could be immunized. Still, the main effect \n     of modern biotechnology to date--and it has been \n     dramatic--is to make traditional weapons, such as anthrax, \n     much cheaper and easier to produce. A basement-sized \n     facility, filled with the sort of equipment found at \n     garden-variety medical labs and biotechnology companies, \n     will do the job; the recipes are available at college \n     libraries; and the ingredients--small cultures of \n     pathogens that can be rapidly multiplied in fermenting \n     tanks--are routinely bought from commercial vendors or \n     passed from professor to graduate students.\n       The weapons that can result are phenomenally destructive. \n     An (excellent) Office of Technology Assessment (OTA) report \n     on weapons of mass destruction estimates that a single \n     warhead of anthrax spores landing in Washington, D.C., on a \n     day of moderate wind could kill 30,000 to 100,000 people--a \n     bit more \n\n[[Page S 18301]]\n     damage than a Hiroshima-sized atomic bomb would do, though nothing like \n     the devastation from a modern nuclear warhead. (And a day of \n     fever, coughing, vomiting and internal bleeding is an \n     appreciably less desirable way to die than incineration.) In \n     addition, anthrax spores buried in the soil, beyond the reach \n     of sunlight, live on. Gruinard Island, where Britain \n     detonated an experimental anthrax bomb during World War II, \n     is still uninhabitable.\n       But a warhead is not the most likely form in which \n     biological weapons will first reach an American city. A \n     ballistic missile, after all, has a return address: so long \n     as the United States has a nuclear deterrent, Americans can \n     feel pretty secure against missile attacks in general. And \n     there's another problem with missile-delivered biological \n     weapons. The technological challenge of making an explosive \n     device yield a widespread mist is considerable. Iraq, we've \n     learned since the war, has done research on anthrax and \n     botulin weapons, but not with evident success. Still, if \n     you're not attacking from a distance and can deliver the \n     spores in person, the obstacles to biological attack \n     diminish. ``Figuring out how to do it in a terrorist kind of \n     way is trivial,'' says one analyst in the defense \n     establishment. Thus the fact that no nation has used \n     biological weapons since World War II is no reflection of the \n     likelihood of their future use. Only recently has the \n     technology become so widely available that a well-organized \n     terrorist group can harness it.\n       Of all the things that might attract terrorists to \n     biological warfare--the relative cheapness, the inconspicuous \n     production--perhaps the most important is the anonymity. A \n     small, private airplane with 220 pounds of anthrax spores \n     could fly over Washington on a north-south route, engage \n     in no notably odd behavior and--by OTA reckoning--trail an \n     invisible mist that would kill a million people on a day \n     with moderate wind. A plane spewing ten times that much \n     sarin would kill only around 600 people--or, on a windier \n     day, 6,000. More to the point: the sarin attack, with its \n     immediate effects, would have authorities hunting for a \n     culprit before the plane landed. Anthrax, in contrast, \n     takes days to kick in; the pilot could be vacationing in \n     the Caribbean before anyone noticed that something was \n     amiss.\n       Or consider this charming scenario, courtesy of Kyle Olson \n     of the Chemical and Biological Arms Control Institute. Get a \n     New York taxicab, put a tank of anthrax in the trunk and, by \n     slightly adapting commercially available equipment, arrange \n     for it to release an imperceptible stream of aerosol. (You \n     would be wise to build a special filter for the air entering \n     the cab, though getting an anthrax vaccination might be \n     enough protection.) Then drive around Manhattan for a day or \n     two. You'll kill tens of thousands, maybe hundreds of \n     thousands, of people. And, again, nobody will know. With \n     nerve gas, in contrast, the long line of gagging, writhing \n     people leading to your taxicab would arouse the suspicion of \n     local authorities--even if your gas mask had somehow escaped \n     their attention.\n       Note that these scenarios make biological weapons \n     potentially genocidal even in an ethnically heterogeneous \n     city. A taxi-cab can be driven all over Harlem, block by \n     block--or, instead, through Chinatown or through the Upper \n     East Side. Terrorists, who have been known to harbor ethnic \n     prejudice, needn't wait for an ethnically biased designer \n     virus.\n       Though biological weapons are the most horrifying terrorist \n     tool today, they are also the furthest from being on the \n     radar screen of any politician who matters. The Biological \n     Weapons Convention of 1975, which commits the United States, \n     Russia and other signatories to forgo any biological weapons \n     program, is so toothless as to make the NPT seem like a steel \n     trap. (When in 1979 the Soviet Union suffered a mysterious \n     outbreak of anthrax in the vicinity of a military research \n     facility, Pentagon officials weren't stunned; but the United \n     States was powerless to pursue its suspicions.) And no \n     remedial proposal from the Clinton administration is \n     imminent. Meanwhile, the most visible result of a series of \n     meetings among BWC signatories about revising the BWC is a \n     series of agreements to keep meeting. There is very little \n     talk anywhere about giving the Biological Weapons Convention \n     a rigor reminiscent of the chemical convention.\n       When you ask people to explain this anomaly, they cite the \n     practical problems that make detecting biological weapons \n     harder than detecting chemical weapons. There are so many \n     small, theoretically suspect rooms, at so many medical and \n     biotech facilities. And upon inspection it's so hard to \n     say for sure whether anything illicit is going on. The \n     perfectly legitimate endeavor of making anthrax vaccine, \n     for example, is an excuse for having anthrax around--one \n     of several potential ``masks'' for weapons production. \n     What's more, a small, inconspicuous supply to pathogens \n     can, via fermentation, be turned into a weapon-scale \n     supply a mere two weeks after a satisfied international \n     inspector cheerfully waves goodbye.\n       It's true that these things dramatically complicate \n     enforcement of the treaty. It's also true that they \n     dramatically underscore the need for enforcement. Knowing \n     that in thousands and thousands of buildings on this planet \n     some graduate student or midlevel manager could be breeding \n     enough anthrax spores to decimate the city where I live--\n     well, somehow I don't find that conducive to a laissez-faire \n     attitude. Using the plausibility of biological warfare as \n     reason not to reduce that plausibility is a bit too rich in \n     irony.\n       A few wild-eyed radicals have gone so far as to suggest new \n     approaches to the problem. One idea is to \n     ``internationalize'' the production of vaccines; or, at \n     least, to compress each country's vaccine production into \n     fewer facilities, for easier (and assiduous) international \n     monitoring. That would strip all other facilities of one of \n     the masks for weapons production--so that, say, anthrax \n     spores found during a challenge inspection would be hard to \n     explain away.\n       This reform, of course, assumes that there is such a thing \n     as a challenge inspection for biological weapons, which there \n     isn't. Adding such inspections to the BWC is about the most \n     ambitious idea now floating around in the Clinton \n     administration (and it's not floating at the highest levels). \n     The idea hear wouldn't be to make the BWC as comprehensive as \n     the CWC. The degree of routinized inspections envisioned in \n     the CWC is probably impractical for biological weapons, given \n     the sheer number of places that would be candidates for \n     inspection. Rather, a revised BWC might simply have \n     signatories provide data about all such sites and be \n     subjected to an occasional challenge inspection--at these \n     sites, or at undeclared sites. This would make the production \n     of biological weapons an endeavor of at least incrementally \n     increased risk. And with weapons of mass destruction, every \n     increment counts.\n       To that end, various other measures--for ``transparency,'' \n     international intelligence pooling and so on--are also \n     bandied about. The collective result of such measures is \n     called a ``web of deterrence'' by Graham Pearson of \n     Britain's Ministry of Defense. Pearson reflects the view \n     of the British government that the BWC is in principle \n     ``verifiable.'' The Clinton administration, in contrast, \n     has yet to amend the official U.S. verdict to the \n     contrary, which it inherited from the Reagan-Bush era of \n     cold-war-think, with its inordinate fear of intrusive \n     inspections by communist masterminds. (The Reagan \n     administration more or less stumbled into a highly \n     intrusive CWC; Assistant Secretary of Defense Richard \n     Perle raised the issue of ``challenge inspections,'' \n     confident that the Soviets would say no, as a means of \n     embarrassment. Then Mikhail Gorbachev assumed power and \n     called his bluff. The rest is history.)\n       One idea that has surfaced at the BWC's periodic meetings \n     on self-improvement is to piggyback a new, tougher BWC onto \n     the CWC. The CWC's governing body at the Hague could expand \n     to encompass both chemical and biological weapons, \n     metamorphosing from OPCW to OPCBW. Assuming that a new \n     biological convention emulated the chemical convention in \n     providing penalties for noncompliance, the two sets of \n     penalties could be fused. If a country not complying with \n     either treaty were cut off from some trade in both chemicals \n     and biotechnology equipment, noncompliance would be extremely \n     unattractive.\n       For that matter, in theory--and in the long run--the NPT \n     could be thrown in with this mix, so that the illegal \n     development of any weapon of mass destruction complicated \n     one's access to state-of-the-art chemical, biological and \n     nuclear technology. This would give the NPT much of the force \n     it now lacks, and would create a world in which the \n     responsible use of technology is a prerequisite for \n     untrammeled access to it. Needles to say, anyone who \n     suggested such a thing in Washington policy-making circles \n     would be expelled on grounds of hopeless romanticism.\n\n\n                                   iv\n\n       There are political reasons why biological weapons have \n     been given little of the attention they deserve. For one \n     thing, ratification of the Chemical Weapons Convention is \n     seen as a prerequisite for a new biological weapons \n     initiative. The CWC took more than a decade of arduous \n     negotiating. If it flops, no one is going to volunteer to \n     lead the world on another visionary arms-control campaign.\n       Unfortunately, the CWC has been languishing in the Senate \n     for nine months. It has the nominal support of some important \n     people, such as President Clinton and Senator Richard Lugar \n     of the Foreign Relations Committee. (Fortunately, Committee \n     Chairman Jesse Helms--who at last check was getting India \n     mixed up with Pakistan--is said to have ceded control of the \n     CWC issue to Lugar.) But neither Clinton, Lugar nor anyone \n     else of stature has chosen to adopt the CWC as his mission in \n     life. Eleven deaths on a Japanese subway didn't push the \n     issue across the cause-du-jour threshold.\n       Just as progress on chemical arms would pave the way for \n     progress on biological arms, extension of the NPT by an \n     overwhelming majority is considered a prerequisite for \n     discussing major reforms in the NPT verification regime. \n     Indeed, NPT extension would provide a quite bright \n     spotlight in which President Clinton could inaugurate this \n     very discussion--or for the matter a broader discussion on \n     weapons of mass destruction. This spotlight would also \n     provide a domestic political opportunity for a president \n     often dismissed as insufficiently presidential.\n       Of course, this is boilerplate thinkpiece-ending advice for \n     presidents: give a speech; have a vision. It's easy to say if \n     you don't have to spell out your fuzzy idealism in detail, \n     much less reconcile it with gritty reality. But Brad Roberts \n     of the Center for Strategic and International Studies--not \n     exactly a hotbed of woolly-minded one-worldism--laid out a \n     pretty concrete version \n\n[[Page S 18302]]\n     of a lofty Clintonesque vision in a recent issue of The Washington \n     Quarterly. Roberts extensively invoked internationalist \n     acronyms--not just CWC, BWC and NPT, but GATT and NAFTA. \n     Making some nonobvious connections between trade regimes and \n     non-proliferation regimes, he argued that both must be \n     carefully crafted to attract and enmesh a ``new tier'' of \n     states recently endowed by technological evolution with the \n     capacity to manufacture potent weapons. With all these \n     acronyms now in a critical phase in one sense or another, \n     1995 could ``prove a genuine turning point''; ``basic \n     international institutions will end the year either much \n     strengthened or much weakened''--and if the latter, the \n     prospects for a stable post-cold-war world will sharply \n     diminish.\n       If President Clinton ever did decide to exert leadership on \n     the issue of weapons of mass destruction, there is little \n     chance that posterity would deem him alarmist. Not only are \n     the threats he'd be addressing growing; their growth has deep \n     and enduring roots: increasing ingenuity in the manufacture \n     of destructive force; increasing access, via information \n     technology, to the data required for this manufacture; wider \n     availability, in an ever-more industrialized world, of the \n     requisite materials; and the increasing ease of their \n     shipment. The underlying force is truly inexorable; the \n     accumulation of scientific knowledge and its application, via \n     technology, to human affairs.\n       Every once in a while the inevitable results of these \n     trends become apparent--in the discovery that Iraq had an \n     extensive nuclear bomb project and enough chemical weapons to \n     murder a small nation; in the fact that the World Trade \n     Center bombers succeeded in a mission that, given slightly \n     more deft personnel and better financing, could well have \n     involved biological weapons rather than explosives; in the \n     news that a nutty Japanese cult with an international \n     presence was busily amassing a chemical and biological \n     arsenal. So far none of these object lessons has been driven \n     home at the cost of tens of thousands, or hundreds of \n     thousands, of lives. But as time goes by, the cost of lessons \n     will assuredly rise.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/12/08/senate-section/article/S18298-2", "month": "12", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "08", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S18302]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  ORDERS FOR MONDAY, DECEMBER 11, 1995\n\n  Mr. HATCH.

Mr. President, a week or so ago, I had the distinct \npleasure of traveling with our colleague from the State of Florida, \nConnie Mack, along with a bipartisan delegation of 16 Members of the \nHouse of Representatives, to Northern Ireland and the Republic of \nIreland on the occasion of President Clinton's visit there. It was a \nhistoric visit, the first time that a sitting American President \nvisited Northern Ireland.\n  Allow me to say, first of all, that regardless of one's party, \nideology or political persuasion, I think every American, those who \nwere there, those who witnessed on CNN the President's historic visit \nto Ireland, were moved by the reception that our President received.\n  On three different occasions, at speeches in Derry, in Belfast, and \nin Dublin, the estimates of the crowds greeting the President were \napproximately 250,000 people. That does not include the thousands of \npeople who lined the various roadways to welcome the President to the \nNorth of Ireland and to the Republic.\n  His reception was directly related to his efforts over the past 23 \nmonths to try and bring an end to the generational conflict in Northern \nIreland. The last 15 of those months have been the first time in more \nthan 25 years that there has been the absence of violence and the \nthreat of violence that has stemmed from what the people in Ireland \nrefer to as the Troubles.\n  The President deserves enormous credit for setting the stage for that \ncessation of hostilities. His decision to extend a visa to Gerry Adams, \nthe president of the Sinn Fein Party, early in 1994 was the bold move \nthat ultimately resulted in the decision by the IRA to announce a \nunilateral cease-fire in the fall of 1994.\n  For more than 15 months, the peoples of Northern Ireland and Ireland, \nas well as people in Great Britain, have enjoyed the first period of \nunprecedented peace in more than a generation.\n  Still, the issues which are at the root cause of that violence remain \nto be addressed and resolved, Mr. President. Our former colleague, \nSenator George Mitchell of Maine, has been asked by the Governments of \nGreat Britain and Ireland and the political parties in Northern Ireland \nto chair a commission, an international commission, to try and see if \nthe issue of decommissioning of arms and related matters can be \nresolved as we proceed on a twin track, of commencing all-party talks \nby the end of February. It is through these twin tracks that the people \nof Northern Ireland can live in permanent peace, free from violence and \ndiscrimination.\n  The remarkable change in the North is very apparent to all who go \nthere. President Clinton's efforts have made that possible. I would say \nto my colleagues that there is a deep appreciation on the island of \nIreland for that effort. There was a risk involved in it. As my \ncolleague, the Presiding Officer, will recall or remember, that the \nPresident received a lot of advice and counsel about the wisdom of \nextending that first visa to Mr. Adams, given the history of Sinn Fein \nand the IRA. Some questioned whether or not there was a sincere \ncommitment to seek a peaceful resolution of this conflict. Even after \nthe IRA announced its cease-fire last year some continued to question \nwhether it would hold. I know the President heard a lot of advice, the \nbulk of it, in fact, recommended against extending that visa.\n  Our colleagues, Senator Moynihan of New York, Senator Kennedy, and \nothers, urged the President to take the chance, to extend that visa and \nto test whether there was a true commitment to adopting the political \ntrack to resolve differences and whether a cease-fire might work. As a \nresult of that, we have seen, as I described briefly, the events that \nunfolded over the past year or so.\n  Again, Mr. President, Ambassador Jean Kennedy Smith and her staff, \nthe Government of Prime Minister Bruton, Deputy Prime Minister Dick \nSpring, and other Irish officials, did a remarkable job, along with Sir \nPatrick Mayhew and the people of Northern Ireland.\n  I mentioned earlier Gerry Adams. This is a man who has played a very \ncourageous part in the quest for peace for his country men and women.\n  There was a tremendous effort over many months that went into making \nthis trip the tremendous success that it turned out to be. \n\n[[Page S 18303]]\n\n  John Hume, of Derry, whom all of us have met at one time or another \nin the past 20 years, is the individual who really initiated the peace \neffort in Northern Ireland and in Derry. What a remarkable job he and \nothers have done in Derry to bring the two traditions together, the \nnationalist and unionist traditions, to try and achieve economic \nopportunity for people. John Hume and others have worked tirelessly to \nattract business and promote job growth in that community. It was truly \na heartwarming sight to see the American President received by John \nHume in the square of Derry, while more than 50,000 people looked on. \nSome of these people had lined the street since 9 a.m. in the morning, \nand the President arrived late in the afternoon.\n  In the Guild Hall the President got a the tremendous reception; when \nthe song ``The Town I Love So Well'' was sung, the audience was \nliterally moved to tears. That song describes the troubles in Derry \nover the past two and one half decades.\n  In Belfast, at the Christmas tree lighting ceremony, 100,000 people \ngathered in the great square in Belfast--Protestants and Catholics \nalike--welcoming our President to their city. This is the same city, \nwhere a few months ago, you would not have thought of sending an \nAmerican President because of the violence there, and where people were \nfearful of that when they walked into a department store or pub that \nplace would be the subject of attack and violence.\n  What was particularly historic was to see this crowd--again, \npresenting the great traditions of Northern Ireland--come together to \nexpress their appreciation to an American President, the American \npeople, and to the United States Congress; it certainly was one of the \ngreat sights I have witnessed in my tenure here in the United States \nSenate.\n  And then, Mr. President, the President was warmly received by the \nParliament in the Republic of Ireland. The people of Dublin also came \nout en masse to express their appreciation. With over 100,000 people \nthere as witnesses, President Clinton was awarded the ``Freedom of the \nCity'' credentials that have only been awarded to a handful of people \nin Dublin. This was truly a high honor to receive. The President made \nvery compelling remarks during his stay in Dublin.\n  Certainly, the sight of those children that the President constantly \nreferred to when he talked about the opportunities and the hopes for \npeace in Northern Ireland--particularly the two children at the Mackie \nMetal Plant in Belfast--who joined hands, one Catholic, one \nProtestant--representing by the clasping of hands their hopes for \ncoming together and resolving differences so people can live in peace \non the island of Ireland.\n  As a person of Irish descent, for me it was more than just a foreign \nvisit, but a visit by someone whose family, on both sides, has come \nfrom Ireland, going back well into the early part of the last century. \nI was deeply proud that an American President had taken the actions he \nhas over the last couple of years and that this has made a difference \nin people's lives.\n  We have seen this administration take steps in Haiti, now in Bosnia, \nthere in Ireland, and in other places--steps that are certainly full of \nrisks, but nonetheless I think risks worth taking, in the sense that we \nhave been able to make a difference in people's lives.\n  So it was a deeply moving time for those of us who were part of this \ntrip to have been present at a historic visit by an American President \nto a foreign land. For all who witnessed the reception he received, I \nthink it makes everyone--regardless of party, ideology, or political \npersuasion--very proud to be an American.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/12/08/senate-section/article/S18302-4", "month": "12", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "08", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S18303-S18304]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           JAVIER SOLANA--THE NEXT SECRETARY GENERAL OF NATO\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I had the privilege several days ago of \nmeeting with the Foreign Minister of Spain, Javier Solana, who has \nrecently been appointed the new Secretary General of NATO.\n  I happen to believe, Mr. President, that this is a very fine choice, \na superb choice, one that I think should strengthen NATO and the \npolitical leadership of NATO in the months to come, particularly at a \ncritical time when the issue of Bosnia and NATO's role there is going \nto be so very, very important.\n  I know that most Americans are probably not familiar with Mr. Solana \nas a foreign minister of Spain. There has been some criticism raised \nabout this choice over Mr. Solana's opposition some 15 years ago to \nSpain's participation in NATO. As a result of his statements then, \nthere have been those who have criticized his choice to head that \norganization.\n  I thought it might be worthwhile to share something of Mr. Solana's \nbackground and involvement when Spain was making the decision about \nNATO membership. I also think it would be informative for people to \nknow about the critical role he has played in the Spanish Government \nover many years.\n  Finally, I believe my colleagues will be surprised to know of the \ndeep sense of affection that Mr. Solana holds for our country, knowing \nit as well as he does. I say that because Mr. Solana is a physicist, by \nacademic training. He, of course, received his undergraduate degree \nfrom the University of Madrid, and his Ph.D. from the University of \nVirginia, while a Fulbright scholar. He taught physics at the \nUniversity of Chicago in this country before beginning any kind of a \npolitical career. He has published more than 30 books on the subject of \nphysics.\n  Having spent such a great deal of time in our country and receiving a \ngood part of his education here, I know firsthand that he has a deep \nappreciation for our Nation, a great love for America and for \nAmericans.\n  The breadth of Mr. Solana's government experience is also broad and \nvaried. He has served in one capacity or another in every Spanish \nGovernment since 1982, in addition to maintaining a strong involvement \nin his chosen profession of physics. We are talking about someone of \ndeep, long experience. He first served as the Culture Minister and \nsimultaneously held the portfolio of Government spokesman in the early \n1980s. In 1988, he became the Government's Minister of Education and \nserved in that capacity until he was named Foreign Minister in 1992.\n  Mr. President, I am deeply disturbed that some of Mr. Solana's \ncritics go back 15 or more years to talk about Mr. Solana's initial \nopposition to NATO, without bothering to discuss the historical context \nof Spain's participation in NATO.\n  At that time, Spain was emerging from a military dictatorship that \nthey had been under for many years. Mr. Solana felt participation in \nNATO at that particular moment was probably not the wisest course to \nfollow. What is important is what happens after that. The critics fail \nto disclose--as appropriate as it is to point out Mr. Solana's initial \nopposition--that it was also through his efforts several years \nthereafter, that a convincing case was presented to the Spanish people, \non the wisdom of Spain's participating in NATO.\n  If Mr. Solana is going to be criticized for his opposition to Spain \njoining NATO in the first instance, I think it is also appropriate that \nhis involvement in convincing the Spanish people about the wisdom of \nNATO membership be mentioned as well. Certainly, he played a pivotal \nrole in that.\n  He has been described by his colleagues in the foreign affairs field \nas an ``expert'' and a ``pragmatic negotiator,'' who has always adopted \na very commonsense approach to diplomacy. Dr. Solana has remained \nuntouched by recent allegations that have been lodged against certain \nGovernment officials, both with respect to corruption and to the so-\ncalled dirty war, alleged to have been conducted against the Basque \nrebels.\n  I believe, Mr. President, we should be extending our appreciation for \nDr. Solana's willingness to accept the challenge of assuming the \nposition of the Secretary General of NATO at this very critical \njuncture in that organization's history. I, for one, think he is the \nright man for the job. I applaud NATO members for the decision to \nappoint him.\n  Mr. President, at this point, I ask unanimous consent that a \nstatement given by Secretary of State Warren Christopher in support of \nDr. Solana's appointment and a brief biography be printed in the Record \nat the conclusion of my remarks. \n\n[[Page S 18304]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. (See \nexhibit 1.)\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I am confident that Dr. Solana is going to \nmake a very fine Secretary General of NATO, at a time when we ought to \nbe reaching out to new members, as Spain has been a relatively new \nmember of NATO.\n  I think this is a wise move, particularly with someone who has \nenjoyed broad-based support, and is a great friend of the United \nStates, a person who knows our country very well.\n  I had the privilege of being with him in Spain a week ago, and I had \na chance to speak with him at some length. This is an individual, I \nthink, most of our colleagues when they have an opportunity to meet \nhim, will be deeply impressed and pleased with this choice.\n  So, Mr. President, I commend the NATO members for choosing him at \nthis critical hour, and I commend Secretary Christopher for his \nstatement, along with President Clinton's statement in support of his \nnomination.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\nStatement by Secretary of State Warren Christopher on the Selection of \n                Javier Solana as NATO Secretary General\n\n       I am very pleased that the North Atlantic Council has \n     unanimously selected Javier Solana of Spain as the next \n     Secretary General of NATO.\n       Minister Solana has demonstrated time and again his \n     commitment to strengthening NATO as the core institution of \n     our transatlantic alliance. Spain's membership in NATO is due \n     in no small part to his efforts--efforts that were not at all \n     popular at the time. I feel confident that he has the \n     strength vision and leadership to guide NATO during this \n     crucial period as we seek to bring peace to Bosnia and to \n     pursue a measured path on NATO enlargement.\n       Under Minister Solana's leadership, Spain has played a key \n     role in securing the peace in Bosnia. Through the darkest \n     days of that tragedy, Spanish soldiers served in the UN force \n     with distinction. Spanish airmen flew with our pilots. Now \n     Minister Solana will lead the effort to help bring peace to \n     that troubled region.\n       More broadly, Minister Solana has been a leader in \n     promoting deeper ties between Europe and the United States. \n     Indeed, he and Prime Minister Gonzalez have made the \n     strengthening of our transatlantic relationship a priority of \n     Spain's EU Presidency. Their efforts were instrumental in \n     laying the foundation for greater cooperation between the \n     United States and the European Union that we hope to build \n     upon at the upcoming U.S.-EU Summit in Madrid.\n       Minister Solana has also worked to bring Spain into the \n     community of European nations. It is fitting that he will \n     complete his term as Spanish Foreign Minister as President of \n     both the European Union and the Western European Union--two \n     institutions which continue a process of European integration \n     dating to the Marshall Plan.\n       Minister Solana has strong ties to the United States. He \n     was a Fulbright scholar from 1966 to 1968 at the University \n     of Virginia, where he earned his Ph.D. in physics. He \n     returned to this country later as an instructor in physics at \n     the University of Chicago. He has kept up close ties to this \n     country, personal and official, through the intervening \n     years.\n       I have known Minister Solana personally for many years and \n     have worked closely with him on a broad range of issues. I \n     have great confidence in his leadership and his vision, which \n     will serve the Alliance well in coming years. I congratulate \n     Minister Solana on his appointment, and I look forward to \n     working with him as we fulfill NATO's task of guarding peace \n     and stability throughout Europe.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n                        Javier Solana Madariaga\n\n       Minister of Education and Science (since July 1988).\n       A US-trained physicist, Javier Solana has been a member of \n     the executive committee of the Spanish Socialist Workers \n     Party (PSOE) since 1976 and a Madrid deputy in the Cortes \n     (parliament) since 1977. Before assuming his current post, he \n     served concurrently as Minister of Culture and as Government \n     Spokesman.\n       Solana was born on 14 July 1943. He joined the youth \n     organization of the PSOE in the mid-1960s. During his student \n     years he was detained several times by the police and fined \n     for unauthorized political activity. After receiving a degree \n     in physics from the University of Madrid, Solana attended the \n     University of Virginia studied and taught in Chicago, \n     Illinois, and in La Jolla, California. In the early 1970s he \n     became a professor at the University of Madrid.\n       Solana speaks excellent English. His wife, the former \n     Concha Gimenez Diaz-Oyuelos, directs public relations for a \n     state-owned department store. The couple has two children. \n     Solana's brother, Luis heads the Spanish national television \n     network.\n                                                                    ____\n\n  Mr. DODD.
