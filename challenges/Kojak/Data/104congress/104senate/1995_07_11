Mr. President, I rise today to comment on an article \nwhich appeared in the June 29, 1995, issue of the Washington Post, \nregarding the Animas La Plata water storage project in my home State of \nColorado. There were a great many omissions in that article which, \nunfortunately, created a false impression that the Animas La Plata \nproject was unneeded, which I consider to be very unfair and certainly \nuntrue.\n  It is especially appropriate that I respond to that article and the \nfalse impression it created, since the House of Representatives is \ntaking up the Interior appropriations bill this week. I trust that my \ncolleagues in the House will be advised of my comments today.\n  In fairness to the Washington Post, I will presume that its editors \nwere simply unaware of several key considerations which mandate the \nFederal Government's full support of this crucial project. Otherwise, \nit would appear that the Post is knowingly joining in a deliberate \nmisinformation campaign on the part of high-dollar environmental groups \nseeking to describe the Animas La Plata as one of the last great dam \nprojects to be built in the American West.\n  There is no dam on the Animas River. There is no dam on the La Plata \nRiver and there is none planned.\n  There is, however, a small, off-river dam proposed on a small arroyo \nwhich is necessary to create a water storage reservoir. The entire \nproject entails a pumping plant, nothing more, on the bank of the \nAnimas River at Durango, CO.\n  Under the project plan, water could be pumped out of the river and \ninto the Ridges Basin Reservoir. Pumping would cease if the water level \nreaches a certain minimum flow necessary to protect fish. Most water \nwould be pumped during flood stages.\n  The fact is that the Ute Indian Tribes own the senior water rights to \nthe Animas, La Plata, and Florida River systems--as well as four other \nrivers--by virtue of various treaties with the U.S. Government. These \ntreaty rights have been upheld by the Supreme Court of the United \nStates when disputes have arisen in other States. Those disputes took \nthe form of expensive and protracted litigation in the Federal courts.\n  The tribes and the water districts chose negotiation over litigation. \nRather than engage in expensive and divisive legal battles, the tribes \nand the citizens of Colorado and New Mexico chose to pursue a \nnegotiated settlement. The Ute Nations agreed to share their water with \nall people.\n  The people came together in partnership and cooperation with the \nFederal Government to reach a mutually beneficial solution: the Animas \nLa Plata project. Their settlement agreement \n\n[[Page S 9648]]\nwas executed on December 10, 1986. The Settlement Act was ratified by \nCongress and signed into law on November 3, 1988.\n  The Settlement Act is Federal law: the law of the land. It also \nprovided a cost-sharing agreement.\n  The water districts and the States of Colorado and New Mexico have \n``put their money where their mouth is'' and have already lived up to \nthe terms of these agreements:\n  First, the State of Colorado has:\n  Committed $30 million to the settlement of the tribes' water rights \nclaims;\n  Has expended $6 million to construct a domestic pipeline from the \nCortez municipal water treatment plant to the Ute Mountain Ute Indian \nReservation at Towaoc; and\n  Has contributed $5 million to the tribal development funds.\n  Second, the U.S. Congress has appropriated and turned over to the Ute \nMountain Ute and Southern Ute Indian Tribes $49.5 million as part of \ntheir tribal development funds, and\n  Third, water user organizations have signed repayment contracts with \nthe Bureau of Reclamation.\n  The construction of the Animas La Plata project is the only missing \npiece to the successful implementation of the settlement agreement and \nthe Settlement Act. It is time that the U.S. Government kept its \ncommitment to the people.\n  Historically, this country has chosen to ignore its obligations to \nour Indian people. Members of the Ute Tribe had been living in a state \nof poverty that can only be described as obscene. Their only source of \ndrinking water was from ditches dug in the ground. I find it most \ndistressing that the same groups and special interests who are now \nscrambling to block this project also, in other contexts, hold \nthemselves out as the only real defenders of minority rights in this \ncountry. Hogwash.\n  This project would provide adequate water reserves to not only the \nUte Nation, but to people in southwestern Colorado, northern New \nMexico, and other downstream users who rely on this water system for a \nvariety of crucial needs which range from endangered species protection \nto safe drinking water in towns and cities--perhaps even filling \nswimming pools for some of our critics.\n  Opponents of the Animas La Plata project have alleged that the Bureau \nof Reclamation [BUREC], has not adequately analyzed alternative \nprojects. That is not true.\n  BUREC has performed a thorough analysis of all reasonable \nalternatives. No new circumstances exist which require reevaluation of \nthe prior alternatives studies.\n  Exhaustive studies, involving extensive public participation have \ndemonstrated that there is no realistic alternative to the Animas La \nPlata project.\n  This public alternatives process involved an advisory team consisting \nof representatives of all of the entities potentially interested in \nreceiving water from the project and environmental groups such as the \nSierra Club and the San Juan Ecological Society.\n  The advisory team met 11 times in a 2\\1/2\\-year period. In addition, \n10 other public meetings were held with specific groups during that \nsame period.\n  The advisory team evaluated alternatives by comparing critical items \nfor each alternative; alternatives were eliminated until the best \noverall plan was identified.\n  Critical items included: impact on wildlife habitat, fisheries, any \npotential visual degradation, conservation impacts, construction costs, \noperation costs, water conservation, river flows for rafting and \nfishery protection, power usage, recreation, impact on national \nhistoric monuments, and others.\n  Over 60 reservoir sites were identified by the team, approximately 20 \nin the La Plata River drainage and the remainder in the Animas River \ndrainage. The best potential site in the La Plata River drainage is the \nSouthern Ute Reservoir site included in the 1979 Definite Plan Report \n[DPR]. The Ridges Basin Reservoir site was determined to be the best \nsite in the Animas River drainage from an engineering and environmental \nperspective.\n  In both La Plata County, CO, and San Juan County, NM, public \nelections were held on Reclamation's decision to move forward with the \nA/LP project.\n  All of the so-called current objections were raised and discussed in \npublic forums during the course of the election campaigns in those \ncommunities, including the following issues: no analysis of \nalternatives, adverse impact on rafting, no water for the Indians, \nreduced flows in the Animas River, ability of farmers to pay for water, \neffect on wetlands, and the impact on trout and elk habitat.\n  At the end of the process, the general public voted overwhelmingly, \non December 8, 1987, in La Plata County, CO, and on April 17, 1990, in \nSan Juan County, NM, to endorse Reclamation's construction of the A/LP \nproject.\n  In a last ditch effort, two environmental organizations, the Sierra \nClub and the Environmental Defense Fund, again raised ``environmental \nconcerns.'' Additional meetings were held to address those unstated \nconcerns and the groups simply decided not to show up. When asked why, \nthey just responded that they would ``get back to us.''\n  They never did.\n  Since then, they have chosen to simply funnel money into opposition \ncampaigns. These groups have no real suggestions to make. They simply \nbelieve themselves to be somehow more pure, environmentally, than \nanyone else.\n  The only alternative these groups suggest is to ``buy off'' the \nIndians. Of course, the proposed ``buy off'' would be funded by \nhundreds of millions of taxpayer dollars but the groups do not care \nabout that.\n  The Animas La Plata project is a good deal for the taxpayers.\n  The Southern Ute Indians and the Ute Mountain Ute Indian Tribes have \nrejected the buyout proposals. Just like everyone else in our country, \nthey simply want decent and reliable water supplies--using their own \nwater--for their people.\n  In exchange, all the people of the area will benefit. Opponents are \napparently willing to spend even more tax dollars to ``buy off'' the \nIndians than it would cost to complete the project.\n  So, as the Washington Post suggested, there are, indeed, ``politics'' \nbehind the Animas La Plata controversy.\n  I would suggest, however, the political ``games'' are not being \nplayed by project supporters, but rather by a few elite and select high \ndollar special interest groups--``beltway environmentalists''--and \ntheir ensconced cronies in the Department of the Interior and the EPA.\n  It is time to end the trail of broken treaties and fulfill our \ncommitments. Great nations, like great people, keep their words of \nhonor.\n  I implore my colleagues in the House to help us keep our word to the \npeople of Colorado and New Mexico.\n  I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, it is my intention to speak on two \nsubjects this morning. One is a very timely subject relative to an \nannouncement that we anticipate will be made today by the President \nwith regard to relations between the United States and Vietnam.\n  I want to commend our President. By moving to establish full \ndiplomatic relations with the Government of Vietnam, the two-decade-\nlong campaign to obtain the fullest possible accounting of our MIA's in \nSoutheast Asia really now enters a new and more positive phase.\n  I support the President's decision because I continue to believe, and \nthe evidence supports, that increased access to Vietnam leads to \nincreased progress on the accounting issue. Resolving the fate of our \nMIA's has been and will remain the highest priority of our Government. \nThis Nation owes that to the men and the families of the men who made \nthe ultimate sacrifice for their country and for freedom.\n  In pursuit of that goal, I have personally traveled to Vietnam on \nthree occasions. I held over 40 hours of hearings on that subject as \nchairman of the Veterans' Committee back in 1986. I think the \ncomparison between the situation in 1986 and today is truly a dramatic \none.\n In 1986, I was appalled to learn that we had no first-hand information \n\n\n[[Page S 9649]]\nabout the fate of POW/MIA's because we had no access to the Vietnamese \nGovernment, to its military archives or to its prisons. We could not \ntravel to crash sites. We had no opportunity to interview Vietnamese \nindividuals or officials.\n\n  All of this has now changed. American Joint Task Force-Full \nAccounting (JTF-FA) personnel located in Hanoi now have access to \nVietnam's Government, to its military archives, and to its prisons. \nThey now travel freely to crash sites and interview Vietnamese citizens \nand individuals. The extent of United States access is illustrated by \nan excavation last month that involved overturning a Vietnamese \ngravesite.\n  As a result of these developments, the overall number of MIA's in \nVietnam has been reduced to 1,621 through a painstaking identification \nprocess. Most of the missing involve men lost over water or in other \ncircumstances where survival was doubtful and where recovery of remains \nis difficult or unlikely. Significantly, the number of discrepancy \ncases--the cases of those servicemen where the available information \nindicated that either the individual survived or could have survived--\nhas been reduced from 196 to 55. The remaining 55 cases have been \ninvestigated at least once, and some several times.\n  Much, if not most, of this progress has come since 1991 when \nPresident Bush established an office in Hanoi devoted to resolving the \nfate of our MIA's. Opening this office ended almost two decades of \nisolation, a policy which failed to achieve America's goals.\n  It is an understatement to say that our efforts to resolve the fates \nof our MIA's from the Vietnam war have constituted the most extensive \nsuch accounting in the history of human warfare.\n  There are over 8,000 remaining MIA's from the Korean war. A large \nnumber of those are believed to have perished in North Korea, and we \nhave had little cooperation from the Government of North Korea on that \nissue. There are over 78,000 remaining MIA's from World War II. These \nare wars where we were victorious and controlled the battlefield. So I \nfind it ironic that we have already moved to set up liaison offices in \nNorth Korea when that Government has not agreed to the joint operation \nteams that have been used successfully in Vietnam. Nor has North Korea \ngranted access to archives, gravesites, or former POW camps. Vietnam, \non the other hand, has worked steadily over the last 4 years to meet \nthe vigorous goal posts laid down by successive United States \nadministrations.\n  In 1993, opponents of ending our isolationist policy argued that \nlifting the trade embargo would mean an end to Vietnamese cooperation. \nThis is distinctly not the case. As the Pentagon assessment from the \nPresidential delegation's recent trip to Vietnam notes, the records \noffered are ``the most detailed and informative reports'' provided so \nfar by the Government of Vietnam on missing Americans.\n  During the post-embargo period, the Vietnamese Government cooperated \non other issues as well, including resolving millions of dollars of \ndiplomatic property and private claims of Americans who lost property \nat the end of the war.\n  While we have made progress, Americans should not be satisfied by any \nmeans. But there are limits to the results we can obtain by continuing \na policy which, even though modified, remains rooted in the past and is \nstill dominated by the principle of isolation. I think we have reached \nthat limit, Mr. President. It is time to try a policy of full \nengagement.\n  Recognizing Vietnam does not mean forgetting our MIA's, by any means. \nRecognizing Vietnam does not mean that we agree with the policies of \nthe Government of Vietnam. But recognizing Vietnam does help us promote \nbasic American values, such as freedom, democracy, human rights, and \nthe marketplace. When Americans go abroad or export their products, we \nexport an idea, a philosophy, and a government. We export the very \nideals that Americans went to fight for in Vietnam.\n  We justify most-favored-nation status for China for many reasons, one \nof which is that it allows us a means to interact and to communicate \nwith the Chinese in an attempt to bring about change in China. The same \napplication is appropriate for Vietnam.\n  Moreover, diplomatic relations give us greater latitude to use the \ncarrot and stick approach. Diplomatic, economic, and cultural relations \nshould flourish, but we retain leverage because Vietnam still seeks \nmost-favored-nation status and other trading privileges which the \nUnited States controls.\n  Establishing diplomatic relations should also advance other important \nU.S. goals. A prosperous, stable, and friendly Vietnam integrated into \nthe international community will serve as an important impediment to \nChinese expansionism. Normalization should offer new opportunities for \nthe United States to promote respect for human rights in Vietnam. \nFinally, competitive United States businesses which have entered the \nVietnamese market after the lifting of the trade embargo will have \ngreater success with the full faith and confidence of the United States \nGovernment behind them.\n  Mr. President, let me conclude by saying that I hope this step will \ncontinue this country's healing process.

I would like to talk a little bit \nabout risk assessment this morning and some guidelines for which the \napplicability of risk assessment should be used, and why it can be \nvery, very helpful as we address the responsibility of determining \nwhich policies make sense and which policies are redundant and costly \nand inefficient.\n  If we establish principles for risk assessment, some of the bases for \nevaluation should include the following:\n  First, the use of sound science and analysis as the basis for \nconclusions about risk.\n  Second, to use the appropriate level of detail for any analysis.\n  Third, to use postulates, or assumptions, only when actual data is \nnot available.\n  Fourth, to not express risk as a single, high-end estimate that uses \nthe worst-case scenario.\n  I think we have all heard horror stories about various cases where \napplications are promoted and promulgated, and over an extended period \nof time, when much expenditure has taken place in evaluating the \nprospects for a particular approval, we find that the agency has \nevaluated under a worst-case basis. If we, in our daily lives, were to \nmake our decisions based on a worst-case scenario, we probably would \nnot get out of bed in the morning. As a consequence, to reach that kind \nof an evaluation is clearly misleading, in many cases, to the applicant \nthat never would have proceeded with a request for approval from the \nvarious agencies if the applicant had assumed that the agency would \ncome down to the worst-case basis.\n  Oftentimes the agency will follow a particular line to reach a worst-\ncase basis, and after expending a great deal of money and time, they \nlook at another alternative, but only at the conclusion of reaching a \nworst-case scenario. So there are other opportunities that should be \npursued with regard to that.\n  Further, some of the other principles for risk assessment would \nrequire comparing the risk to others that people encounter every day to \nplace it in a perspective. I could speak at some length on that, but I \nthink that is obvious to all of us.\n  Further, to describe the new or substitute risks that will be created \nif the risk in question is regulated.\n  Use independent and external peer review to evaluate risk results.\n  Finally, to provide appropriate opportunities for public \nparticipation.\n  So what we are talking about here is improved risk assessment, which \nhelps the homeowners, farmer, small business, taxpayers, consumers--all \nAmericans. To conclude, risk reduction equals benefit.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/07/11/senate-section/article/S9649-1", "month": "07", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "11", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9650]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n[[Page S 9650]]\n\n\n                  COMPREHENSIVE REGULATORY REFORM ACT\n\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I rise today in support of S. 343, the \nComprehensive Regulatory Reform Act of 1995. Regulatory reform is a \ncritical issue which the Congress should act on promptly in order to \nsignificantly benefit our Nation.\n  When unnecessary regulations are avoided or eliminated, American \nproduction will be more competitive and provide more jobs for American \nworkers. With true regulatory reform, American consumers will have more \nchoices at lower prices.\n  We all are concerned that the health and safety of Americans not be \ncompromised. By using more common sense, however, our Nation can \nachieve the same level of health and safety at far lower costs. \nAvoiding unnecessary regulations frees up our economic resources to be \nused for more important purposes. Every billion dollars saved by \navoiding wasteful regulations is a billion dollars that the private \nsector can invest in new enterprises and new jobs. This will generate \nadditional revenues to bolster our national defense, education, crime \nreduction, and other priorities.\n  The principle of applying cost-benefit analysis and risk assessment \nto Government regulations is hard to seriously dispute. It is based on \nthe simple concept that the Government should not impose rules and \nregulations unless the benefits justify all the costs. The legislation \nwhich we are now considering has been through numerous drafts and \ncompromises in order to achieve this purpose.\n  The bill articulates standards by which the costs and benefits of \nregulations are to be compared, and provides for judicial review of \nactions by the Government. The bill applies not only to new regulations \nas they are formulated, but also to existing rules. The legislation \napplies to relatively large regulations, which impose substantial \ncosts. Importantly, risk assessments are standardized and must rely on \nthe best available science.\n  Mr. President, it is my belief that the principles in S. 343 are \nvital for this Nation. Great effort has been put forth to bring the \nbill to this point, and everyone involved in moving this bill forward \ndeserves our thanks.\n  For all of these reasons, I urge my colleagues to support this \nregulatory reform legislation.\n  In closing, Mr. President, I wish to commend the able Senator from \nTexas [Mrs. Hutchison] for the great job she has done on this important \nmatter, which will be of such benefit to our Nation.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/07/11/senate-section/article/S9650-1", "month": "07", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "11", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9650-S9652]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         FEDERAL OVERREGULATION\n\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Thank you, Mr. President. I want to commend the \nsenior Senator from South Carolina and also the dean of the Senate for \nthe statement that he made.\n  Senator Thurmond has been in this Senate a long time. He has seen the \nevolution of the regulations that have come as a result of the laws \nthat are passed by Congress.\n  I think the Senator from South Carolina is saying that the regulators \nhave gone far beyond congressional intent. He believes, as I do, that \nwe must bring back the regulators, tell them what our congressional \nintent is, and try to bring some balance into the system.\n  I thank the senior Senator from South Carolina for his leadership in \nthis area and appreciate very much that, with his long experience, he \nwould weigh in on behalf of this bill. In fact, it is a very important \nbill.\n  One issue about which all Members have heard from our constituents \nover and over again is the need for fundamental reform of the tortured \nand increasingly tangled web of Federal overregulation.\n  Congress passes laws. We delegate their implementation to regulators. \nIf the regulators do not do what is envisioned by Congress, it is our \nresponsibility to step in.\n  In recent months, I have spoken on the floor of the Senate offering \nexamples of Federal Government overregulation and unintended \nconsequences of regulatory excess that puts Americans out of work. It \nusurps our constitutional rights. It saps our productivity. It saps our \neconomic competitiveness.\n  Americans have a right to expect their Government to work for them, \nnot against them. Instead, Americans have to fight their Government in \norder to drive their cars, graze cattle on their ranches, or operate \ntheir small businesses in a reasonable, commonsense manner.\n  I hear this every time I go home, or when I go to other States. The \npeople of this country are tired of the harassment of their Government, \nand I think that was the message they sent in November 1994.\n  The legislation before the Senate today provides lawmakers with a \ntool for ensuring that Federal agencies are carrying out Congress' \nregulatory intent properly and within the confines of Congress and no \nfarther. Agencies have gotten into the habit of issuing regulations \nwhich go far beyond the intended purpose of the authorizing \nlegislation. This bill is simply an extension of the system of checks \nand balances which has served our country so well for more than two \ncenturies.\n  Senator Thurmond has not been here for all two centuries, but we all \nknow that it has gotten out of whack since Senator Thurmond has been in \nthis Senate, and most certainly in the last 10 years, or 5 years, we \nhave seen the balance go in the wrong direction. It is time to put the \nbalance back in our Government and the ability of our Government to \nregulate our people.\n  In November, the voters sent a message: We are tired of the arrogance \nof Washington, DC. Nothing demonstrates that arrogance more than the \nvolumes of one-size-fits-all regulations which pour out of this city \nand impact on the daily life of the American people.\n  The regulators in Washington, it seems, believe that everyone can fit \ninto one cookie-cutter mold. They do not take into account the \ndifferent situations in each business, in each State, in each city, and \nthe things that might be affecting safety or whatever the regulation is \ncovering in that city.\n  I believe the voters went to the polls because they felt harassed by \ntheir Government, the Government that issues regulations without any \nthought of the impact on the small businesses of this country.\n  You just do not feel the pinch of being a small business person \nunless you have been there, unless you have lived with the regulations \nand the mandates and the taxes that our small business people live with \nevery day.\n  Our small business people, Mr. President, are the economic engine of \nthis country. Government is not the economic engine of America. Small \nbusiness is. They create 80 percent of the new jobs in this country. \nSometimes they feel like their Government is trying to keep them from \ngrowing and prospering and creating new jobs.\n  If they do not grow and prosper and create new jobs, how are we going \nto absorb the new people coming into our economic system, the young \npeople graduating from college, the immigrants who are coming into our \ncountry? How are we going to absorb them if we continue to force our \nsmall businesses to put money into regulatory compliance and redtape \nand filling out forms, instead of into the business to buy new machines \nthat create new jobs. That is the issue we are talking about today.\n  When I meet with small business people, men and women across our \ncountry, complaints about excessive Federal regulations are always at \nthe top of their list.\n In fact, a few weeks ago the White House hosted a conference on small \nbusiness and, according to those with whom I spoke who went to the \nconference, no one issue and no one agency energized the participants \nmore than the need for comprehensive regulatory reform.\n\n  They talk about taxes, yes. But, mostly, those small business people \nsay, ``If you will get the regulations off our backs so we can compete, \nthat's when we will be able to throw the shackles off and grow and \nprosper and create the new jobs for our country.''\n  So, Mr. President, I am proud to be a cosponsor of the Comprehensive \nRegulatory Reform Act of 1995. This bill is necessary to get the \nregulatory process under control. The Republican majority of this \nCongress recognizes that the problems that business owners face are \nhurting our country and we are committed to doing something about it. \nWe are committed to regulatory reform legislation that will establish a \nflexible \n\n[[Page S 9651]]\ndecisionmaking framework for Federal agents, so they know what the \nparameters are. We need to make our congressional intent very clear.\n  Some of the regulators might have gotten out of control unwittingly. \nMaybe we were not clear enough. Congress has passed broad, general \nsorts of guidelines in the past. Maybe it is time we pass laws that are \nspecific, so the regulators have no doubts. I think that is our \nresponsibility, and this bill will take a step in that direction.\n  We need to increase public participation in the regulatory \ndecisionmaking process. That is what this bill will do. It will bring \nin peer groups to talk about the effects of the regulations so the \nregulators will know if there is a scientific basis for this \nregulation, if we really need it, how does it affect the workplace, the \nmarketplace, worker safety, worker harassment--that is what this bill \nwill speak to.\n  It will require political and judicial accountability. If you do not \nhave judicial accountability, there will not be any teeth in this law. \nSo we will have the ability to have judicial review, to see if the \nregulation meets the test of the law that is passed.\n  This bill will require the regulators to ask and answer the \nquestions, ``Is the regulation worth the cost?'' And, ``Does this \napproach maximize the benefits to society as a whole?'' That is what \nthe basic concept of this bill is.\n  We have heard a lot about food safety. That is something the press \nhas really talked about in the last couple of days. They have shown \nmeatpacking plants and talked about the E. coli virus and the things \nthat might happen if we have regulatory reform that will require the \nthings we are talking about.\n  The fact is, food safety is exempt from this bill. It is not spoken \nto. It is exempt because no one wants to worry about the safety of our \nfood. So it is very important, as we look at the press that is going to \nbe coming out of this bill, that we realize there are some very \nimportant exceptions because we want to make sure we do not do \nsomething that is going to hurt the health or welfare of the people of \nthis country.\n  No, the Regulatory Reform Act of 1995 is trying to put balance and \ncommon sense back into the system. We have survived in this country for \n2 centuries with a balanced approach. It is only in the last 5 or 10 \nyears that we have gone so far in the direction of excesses that we \nmust now say to our business people, ``We are going to try to put some \ncommon sense into this equation. We are going to put people ahead of \nblind salamanders.'' That is the purpose of this act.\n  The key principle embodied in this bill is cost-benefit analysis. Is \nit worth it? The premise is simple. Before an agency promulgates a \nregulation, it systematically measures the benefits of the regulation \nand compares those benefits to the costs. This analysis allows a full \nand complete understanding of the regulatory burden imposed on \nconsumers by the Federal Government. Is the price increase, \nnecessitated by the regulation, to people who are in the grocery store, \nworth the benefit to be gained? And, further, will the benefit actually \nbe gained? That is a question that is not asked. Will the regulation \nactually achieve the purpose that it is supposed to achieve? That is a \nvery important, basic concept, and that is what a cost-benefit analysis \ndoes.\n  I want to talk more about cost-benefit analysis because there have \nbeen some studies done that show that we can spend $900 million to \npossibly save one life when we could take the same $900 million and \nassure that we would save hundreds of lives in other ways. So it \nbecomes a matter of how we spend our resources. How will it benefit the \nmost people? And that is what bringing common sense into the system \nwill do.\n  Risk assessment is an important complement to cost-benefit analysis. \nThe problem with the current regulatory process is that it often \nfocuses on minor risks while ignoring far greater threats to public \nhealth and safety. There are many risks to public health and, without \neffective risk assessment, funds available to address these risks will \nbe needlessly squandered on questionable programs that do little to \nreally promote public health and safety and environmental protection.\n  In my home State of Texas we had the incredible experience of having \na new mandate put on the citizens of Dallas and Houston and El Paso and \nBeaumont--cities that were in nonattainment areas for air quality, \ncities that are trying desperately to do something about it. El Paso \nhas tried in every way to clean its air. But, because there is smoke \ncoming across the border from Juarez, they are not able to do anything. \nAnd it is not their fault.\n  Nevertheless, they were put under a mandate to have a vehicles \nemissions test by a certain specific machine that would possibly, we \nare told, have cleaned the air maybe 0.5 percent--maybe, rather than \nwith other types of machines that are much cheaper, that would not have \nrequired the hassle to every consumer in those cities, and which would \nhave done much the same but at much less cost. And it was not even \nproven that was the only machine that would be able to detect these \nemissions. Yet we had the requirement that we had to go to certain \ncenters with just that machine, and the cost was in the hundreds of \nmillions of dollars to the consumers of Texas. We were faced with doing \nthat because of dealing with the EPA and not being able to have the \nflexibility to do what we could in a cost-beneficial manner.\n  We are all trying to clean up the air. Of course, we are. But how \nmuch is going to be the cost to possibly get a 0.5-percent benefit to \nthe air quality? And we are not even sure that it was necessary just to \nhave that one machine. We find that there are also infrared rays that \nwill pick up at an entry ramp the emissions that do not meet the test. \nWe have an experiment that is in the works right now that would give us \nthe ability to buy some time and in a much more cost-efficient way with \nmuch less hassle for the consumers of the cities all across America \nthat are in the noncontainment areas. We could have something just as \neffective for them at a much less cost. That is what risk assessment \nand cost-benefit analysis will do for our country and for the \nregulators.\n  Judicial review. Without judicial review, there is no way to ensure \nthat the Federal agencies will use the risk assessment and the cost-\nbenefit analysis to write the regulations. I mean, that is what we have \nto have. We have to have the leverage that is out there so that we will \nbe able to go to the judges and say, ``Did we meet the standard that is \nrequired under the law?'' And Congress is being specific about \ncongressional intent.\n  Good science, open science. It is important that we have the \nscientific basis for these regulations because we do not know for sure \nin many instances that there really is good, sound science in the \nsunshine in the regulations that are put forth.\n  This we assured in the bill with peer review. In most cases today, \nthe scientific and technical assessment on which regulations are based \nare not subjected to independent external peer review. As a result, the \nscientific and technical underpinnings of agency actions that may have \nenormous consequences often are not adequately tested. Regulation \nreform is necessary to assure that there will be an independent \nexternal peer review. We can get many of the scientists that understand \nthese issues to be on a peer review panel to make sure that we have the \nability to say absolutely for certain this regulation will accomplish \nwhat it is intended to accomplish. So regulation reform will reduce the \nburden of unnecessary Federal regulation.\n  Requiring cost-benefit analysis, risk assessment, judicial review, \nand the threat of congressional action will go a long way toward \nensuring common sense in the promulgation of Federal regulations.\n  There will be the ability in this bill for Congress to have 60 days \nto review any regulation and turn it back. That is a very important \npoint. It is very important that Congress will be able to come in and \nsay to regulators that they have gone beyond what we intended. That is \nthe ultimate responsibility of Congress, and it is one that we must \ntake.\n  So, Mr. President, we are beginning now to set the framework in this \ndebate. There has been a lot of hot air in the last week about what \nmight happen if we do not have this ability to come in and put checks \non the system. A lot has been said about what will happen if \n\n[[Page S 9652]]\nwe put some checks and balances in the system.\n  Mr. President, I think this is a great step for the small business \npeople of this country, and I am proud that the sponsors of the bill \nhave done such a terrific job on a bipartisan basis to help the small \nbusiness people of our country compete.\n  Mr. President, I will stop here because I know that at 9:45 they are \ngoing to propose another amendment. But I just want to thank the \nmanagers of the bill, the sponsors of the bill, and the leadership for \ntaking this very important step to free our businesses to compete in \nthe international marketplace and for our small businesses to be able \nto grow and prosper and create the jobs that are going to keep this \neconomy vital for the new people and to keep the young people \ngraduating from high school and college employed. That is the goal, Mr. \nPresident.\n  I thank the Chair. I yield the floor.\n  \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/07/11/senate-section/article/S9650-2", "month": "07", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "11", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9652]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n          HONORING THE HUMANITARIAN EFFORTS OF PAUL H. HENSON\n\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, today I am proud to honor a man who has \ndistinguished himself in business, as a civic leader, a caring \nneighbor, and a friend to those in need. Mr. Paul H. Henson will soon \nbe awarded the International Humanitarian Award by the CARE Foundation \nat its 50th Anniversary International Humanitarian Award dinner. Mr. \nHenson was nominated for the award for his sustained support of \nhumanitarian causes, for his community foresight, and for his business \ningenuity. It is with much pleasure that I add my voice to the scores \nof others praising Mr. Henson for his efforts to aid the world's poor \nand help them achieve social and economic well-being.\n  Mr. Henson began his successful career in the telecommunications \nindustry as a groundman for the Lincoln Telephone Co., in his native \nState of Nebraska. After attaining the position of chief engineer, Mr. \nHenson moved to United Telecom--now Sprint--in Kansas City. In 1964, at \nthe age of 38, he became president of United and began to implement an \naggressive leadership and expansion strategy to transform the \npredominantly rural telephone company into an international \ncommunications force. Henson presided over the construction of the \nfirst--and still the only--nationwide 100 percent digital, fiber-optic \nnetwork and made it the centerpiece of the company's long-distance \nstrategy. After his leadership of Sprint for 25 years, the company now \nclaims over 6 million local telephone customers, 97 percent of which \nare digitally switched.\n  Mr. Henson currently serves as chairman of the board and chairman of \nthe executive committee of Kansas City Southern Industries, Inc. He has \nalso formed Kansas City Equity Partners, L.C., a venture capital fund \ndedicated to providing seed capital and management assistance for \nentrepreneurial activities.\n  Paul H. Henson's distinguished business career and his reinvestment \nin the community through support of the humanitarian initiatives \nchampioned by the CARE Foundation have rightly earned him the \ndistinction of being awarded the Foundation's International \nHumanitarian Award.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/07/11/senate-section/article/S9652-1", "month": "07", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "11", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9652]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                        IN MEMORY OF WHITE EAGLE\n\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Mr. President, last Friday, the operatic tenor White \nEagle passed away at age 43. My wife, Harriet and I join with countless \nothers from around the world in expressing our condolences to his \nfriends and family. Our Nation has lost an exemplary individual who had \nan extraordinary voice.\n  White Eagle was a Lakota. His Lakota name was Wanbli ska. He first \nsang in public in his father's church. He was only 5 years old. It was \nthe voice of the great Mario Lanza that inspired the young White Eagle \nto become an opera singer. In 1985, he graduated from the Merola Opera \nProgram at the San Francisco Opera. He went on to perform with the \nPennsylvania Opera Theater, the Florentine Opera, the Western Opera \nTheater, the Cleveland Opera, and the Skylight Comic Opera.\n  Many of my friends and colleagues here in Washington should remember \nwell White Eagle's rich tenor voice. In 1989, White Eagle performed the \nfinale at the Inaugural Gala for President George Bush. Two years \nlater, the President and I had the opportunity to hear and appreciate \nhis extraordinary talent at the Golden Anniversary of the Mount \nRushmore National Memorial. And in 1993, he debuted in Carnegie Hall, \nand was inducted into the South Dakota Hall of Fame as Artist of the \nYear.\n  I am pleased that a scholarship fund has been established in his \nname. It is a fitting remembrance of his spirit, his leadership, and \nhis legacy as a role model for native American youth.\n  It is said that a man's talents are a mere extension of his soul. \nThat is certainly true of White Eagle. The strength, the beauty, and \nthe richness of his voice were a reflection of his character, and the \nvalues of the Lakota Sioux--the values of bravery, integrity, wisdom, \ndetermination, and generosity. His voice moved us all.\n  Mr. President, White Eagle exemplified those values yet again when, \nin 1990, he was diagnosed with AIDS. After he made his illness public, \nhe became a tireless advocate for AIDS awareness. His role as advocate \nwas equal to his role as artist, because through his voice, through his \nmessage, he brought people together. His last years are a reminder to \neach of us of the capacity in ourselves to reach out to family and \nfriends in times of human struggle and suffering.\n  White Eagle left us in the manner he lived among us--with dignity and \nbravery. He has left us richer for his courage and perseverance. For \nall the extraordinary gifts he possessed and shared with us, we are \ngrateful. We will miss him.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/07/11/senate-section/article/S9652-2", "month": "07", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "11", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9652-S9653]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n   ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTY-FIVE YEARS OF COPYRIGHT IN THE LIBRARY OF \n                                CONGRESS\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the 125th \nanniversary of the act of 1870 which established our first central \nnational copyright registration and deposit system by bringing it into \nthe Library of Congress. Last Saturday marked the anniversary of the \nact being signed into law and today Librarian of Congress James \nBillington and Register of Copyrights Marybeth Peters are hosting a \nprogram to honor the employees of the Copyright Office for the work \nthey do both for our national copyright system and the Library.\n  Article 1 of the Constitution grants Congress the power to ``promote \nScience * * *'', or knowledge, by granting authors, for a limited time, \nexclusive rights in their writings. The intent of the Framers was to \nincrease the knowledge of the people by encouraging authors to create \nworks. The first copyright law, enacted in 1790, reflected that purpose \nin its title: ``An act for the Encouragement of Learning * * * ''. The \n1790 act also established a system of copyright registration where a \nperson wishing to register a work did so in the nearest Federal court \nand sent a copy of the work to the Secretary of State in the Nation's \nCapital.\n  The registration statute changed somewhat after 1790, but it was not \nuntil 1870 that Congress passed legislation which established the \nLibrary of Congress as the first central agency which would both \nperform the copyright registration function and serve as the custodian \nof copyright deposits in the United States.\n  The 1870 act allowed for a national system of copyright registration \nwith improved efficiency for the Federal Government, for authors and \nartists, and for publishers. Works submitted for copyright registration \nwere sent to one location and could be carefully recorded and \ncataloged. For the first time, a copy could be used as both a record of \nregistration and as a resource available to future generations of \nAmericans.\n  In addition to strengthening our copyright registration system, the \n1870 act also ensured that the Library of Congress would be the \nrecipient of the tremendous amount of material submitted for copyright \nregistration. The 1870 act put the Library on a path to becoming the \ngreatest repository of knowledge in the world. To this day, the Library \nrelies on the works it receives through copyright.\n  The Copyright Office, a part of the Library, provides Congress with \nnonpartisan analysis of copyright law and implements all aspects of \nthis law. It \n\n[[Page S 9653]]\nalso serves as a valuable resource to the domestic and international \ncopyright communities. The Office registers almost 600,000 works a \nyear.\n  Copyright has been a critical element of American creative and \neconomic life since the beginning of our Nation.

Mr. President, during consideration of S. 343, the \nRegulatory Reform Act, I intend to offer an amendment to waive \nadministrative and civil penalties for local governments when Federal \nwater pollution control compliance plans are in effect.\n  I believe this amendment is a simple issue of fairness to local \ngovernments and I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this \namendment. I ask unanimous consent that my amendment be printed in the \nRecord, along with my ``Dear Colleague'' letter.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n                            Amendment No. --\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC.   . WAIVER OF PENALTIES WHEN FEDERAL WATER POLLUTION \n                   CONTROL ACT COMPLIANCE PLANS ARE IN EFFECT.\n\n       Section 309 of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act (33 \n     U.S.C. 1319) is amended by adding at the end the following:\n       ``(h) Waiver of Penalties When Compliance Plans Are in \n     Effect.--\n       ``(1) In general.--Except as provided in paragraph (2), \n     notwithstanding any other provision of this Act, no civil or \n     administrative penalty may be imposed under this Act against \n     a unit of local government for a violation of a provision of \n     this Act (including a violation of a condition of a permit \n     issued under this Act)--\n       ``(A) if the unit of local government has entered into an \n     agreement with the Administrator, the Secretary of the Army \n     (in the case of a violation of section 404), or the State to \n     carry out a compliance plan with respect to a prior violation \n     of the provision by the unit of local government; and\n       ``(B) during the period--\n       ``(i) beginning on the date on which the unit of local \n     government and the Administrator, the Secretary of the Army \n     (in the case of a violation of section 404), or the State \n     enter into the agreement; and\n       ``(ii) ending on the date on which the unit of local \n     government is required to be in compliance with the provision \n     under the plan.\n       ``(2) Requirement of good faith.--Paragraph (1) shall not \n     apply during any period in which the Administrator, the \n     Secretary of the Army (in the case of a violation of section \n     404), or the State determines that the unit of local \n     government is not carrying out the compliance plan in good \n     faith.\n       ``(3) Other enforcement.--A waiver of penalties provided \n     under paragraph (1) shall not apply with respect to a \n     violation of any provision of this Act other than the \n     provision that is the subject of the agreement described in \n     paragraph (1)(A).''.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                               Washington, DC,\n\n                                                    June 27, 1995.\n       Dear Colleague: When the Senate begins consideration of S. \n     343, the Regulatory Reform Bill, I intend to offer an \n     amendment to lift the unfair burden of excessive civil \n     penalties from the backs of local governments that are \n     working in good faith with the Clean Water Act.\n       Under current law, civil penalties begin to accumulate the \n     moment a local government violates the Clean Water Act. Once \n     this happens, the law requires that the local government \n     present a Municipal Compliance Plan for approval by the \n     Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), \n     or the Secretary of the Army in cases of Section 404 \n     violations. However, even after a compliance plan has been \n     approved, penalties continue to accumulate. In effect, \n     existing law actually punishes local governments while they \n     are trying to comply with the law.\n       Under my amendment, local governments would stop \n     accumulating civil and administrative penalties once a \n     Municipal Compliance Plan has been negotiated and the \n     locality is acting in good faith to carry out the plan. \n     Further, my amendment would act as an incentive to encourage \n     governments to move quickly to achieve compliance with the \n     Clean Water Act.\n       This amendment is a simple issue of fairness. Local \n     governments must operate with a limited pool of resources. \n     Localities should not have to devote their tax revenue to \n     penalties, while having to comply with the law. Rather, by \n     discontinuing burdensome penalties, local governments can \n     better concentrate their resources to meet the intent of the \n     law in protecting our water resources from pollution.\n       I hope you will join me in supporting this commonsense \n     amendment for our towns and cities. If you have any questions \n     or wish to cosponsor this amendment, please feel free to have \n     a member of your staff contact Quinn Mast of my staff at 4-\n     5842.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   Larry Pressler,\n     United States Senator.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/07/11/senate-section/article/S9653-1", "month": "07", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "11", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9653]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           WAS CONGRESS IRRESPONSIBLE?

Mr. President, last week marked the 50th Annual Sitting \nBull Stampede in Mobridge, SD. People from across the State and Nation \njoined together in celebrating a long-standing tradition which first \nbegan in 1946. The stampede has a long and colorful history, and it \nserves to remind people of South Dakota's proud heritage.\n  It is appropriate that the Sitting Bull Stampede is named after the \nfamed Sioux leader. The multicultural diversity of the event recognizes \nthe contributions of both native Americans and non-native Americans to \nSouth Dakota in the last century. As my colleagues know, Sitting Bull \nwas a famous leader and medicine man of the Lakota people. This native \nAmerican hero was born in the Mobridge area and lived there for much of \nhis life. His remains are buried on a nearby bluff overlooking the \nMissouri River.\n  The Sitting Bull Stampede began as a small rodeo organized by a group \nof cowboys. As the rodeo became more successful, the stampede began to \ntake on a cultural focus. Last week's celebration was one of the \nbiggest thus far, complete with parades, rodeos, a carnival, and many \nother festivities. More than 400 contestants competed in this year's \nrodeo. Miss Rodeo America, Jennifer Douglas, was on hand to assist in \nthe crowning of this year's stampede queen, Anne Lopez of Keldron.\n  Mr. President, I am very proud of the accomplishments of the people \nof the Mobridge area in planning such a tremendous event. The Sitting \nBull Stampede brings two cultures of our State together. It reminds us \nnot to forget our past as we progress into the future. I extend my best \nwishes to the citizens of Mobridge and all who participated in this \nyear's events.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/07/11/senate-section/article/S9653-3", "month": "07", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "11", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9653]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. HEFLIN. Yes.\n  Mr. HATCH. I ask unanimous consent that no amendment be filed until \nSenator Dole has an opportunity to get here from the wings.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HEFLIN. Mr. President, I am pleased to support and cosponsor S. \n343, the Comprehensive Regulatory Reform Act of 1995. The time has come \nfor meaningful regulatory reform and for the Congress to exercise its \nlegitimate legislative function to set statutory standards to guide \nFederal agencies with regard to their rulemaking authority.\n  Since my term as chief justice of the Alabama Supreme Court when I \nand others set out to reform Alabama's antiquated judicial system, I \nlearned that true reform never comes easy. Entrenched bureaucracy and \nvested interest groups will fight you every inch of the way, as I know \nthey are now doing.\n  President Clinton acknowledged the need for regulatory reform in a \nspeech on March 16 of this year when he called for common sense in \napproaching regulatory reform. He said, and I agree, that ``government \ncan be as innovative as the best of our private sector businesses. It \ncan discard volume after volume of rules and, instead, set clear goals \nand challenge people to come up wit their own ways to meet them.''\n  The substitute bill that has emerged is the product of several \nhearings before the Judiciary Committee, the Energy Committee, and the \nGovernmental Affairs Committee. Extensive discussions have occurred \nover the last several weeks in an attempt to fashion a consensus bill \nwhich can pass the Senate and will be signed by the President. I \nbelieve our efforts will prove successful because the bill under \nconsideration is not extreme reform.\n  It does not contain a supermandate, as the House bill does, which \nwould overturn Federal laws to protect our environment, protect worker \nsafety, or guarantee product safety.\n  The last time the Senate attempted to legislate in this area was 15 \nyears ago when working in a bipartisan manner we passed 94-0 a bill \nknown as S. 1080. Regretfully, certain interest groups prevailed upon \nthe House of Representatives to kill our reform efforts.\n  I was a cosponsor of S. 1080 which was drafted to address \ndeficiencies in the Federal regulatory system and to improve the \nrulemaking process of public notice and comment. The Judiciary \nCommittee report at that time found that the ``dramatic costs of \nregulation suggest that we may be expending our limited resources on \nuncertain regulatory remedies for various costs at a significant human \ncost by depriving other vital interests of these resources.''\n  The 1982 report found that annual compliance costs of Federal \nregulation, that is, costs which are borne by those who must comply \nwith regulations, were running ``at more than $100 billion a year.'' \nThe 1995 report from the Judiciary Committee concludes that these costs \nare now approximately $542 billion. Congress must act to address this \nproblem.\n\n\n                               rulemaking\n\n  I note that the first part of the substitute incorporates many \nprocedural improvements to section 553 of the Administrative Procedure \nAct which defines the rulemaking process. This section substantially \nincorporates and updates the provisions of S. 1080.\n  This section requires public notice of proposed rulemaking in the \nFederal Register and expands the amount of information which must be \ngiven by an agency to the public so that it can adequately comment on \nthe proposal. An exemption is established from this requirement where \nsuch a proposed rule would be ``contrary to an important public \ninterest or has an insignificant impact.''\n  There are other provisions which are too numerous to mention, but \nthis section is strongly supported by many legal scholars and the \nAmerican Bar Association.\n\n\n                        analysis of agency rules\n\n  The second section of the substitute deals with the analysis of \nagency rules defining expansively the terms ``costs'' and ``benefits'' \nto include, not just quantitative considerations, but also qualitative \nconsiderations of what a cost-benefit analysis should contain. This \nsection also contains a definition of a ``major rule'' which is set at \n$50 million, a figure that is arguably too low especially since every \nPresident since Gerald Ford has defined, by Executive order, a major \nrule to be $100 million, as does S. 291, the regulatory bill that \nreported out of the Governmental Affairs Committee.\n  An earlier draft of this legislation provided that a major rule could \nalso be less that $50 million if it were likely to result in \ndisproportionate costs to a class of persons or businesses within the \nregulated sector. This provision would have given relief to many small \nbusinesses who are all too often threatened with being put out of \nbusiness due to the costs of implementing a rule. I support an \namendment offered by Senator Nunn which will assure that our Nation's \nsmall businesses will derive the benefits intended by our reform \nefforts in this bill. The Nunn amendment would require that a proposed \nrule which has been determined to be subject to the Regulatory \nFlexibility Act be considered a major rule for the purposes of cost \nbenefit analysis and periodic review. Agencies frequently propose rules \nwhose annual economic impact would not rise to the $50 million \nthreshold set by this bill, but those rules can and do place \nsignificant burdens on small businesses. The Nunn amendment will assure \nthat cost benefit analysis benefit small businesses.\n  I might add that the substitute exempts from the definition of \n``rule'' those rules which related to future rates, wages, prices, \nmonetary policy, protection of deposit insurance funds, farm credit \ninsurance funds, or rate proceedings of the Federal Energy Regulatory \nCommission.\n  Once an agency has determined that a rule is a major rule, the agency \nmust conduct a cost-benefit analysis to demonstrate that, based on the \nrulemaking record as a whole, the benefits justify the costs and that \nthe rule imposes the least cost of any of the reasonable alternatives \nthat the agency has the discretion to adopt. Quite simply put, this \nmeans that if a Chevrolet will get you to your goal, pick it and not \nthe Cadillac model.\n\n\n                       agency review and petition\n\n  The next section of this substitute requires each agency to publish a \nlist of existing rules, general statements of policy, or guidances that \nhave\n the force and effect of rules, that the agency deems to be appropriate \nfor review, and each agency must publish a schedule for systematic \nagency review of those rules. The agency schedule shall propose \ndeadlines for review of each rule and the deadlines will occur not \nlater than 11 years from the initial schedule established by the \nagency. This timeframe, to me, is a reasonable one and should allay \nconcerns that agencies will be swamped with too much work as a result \nof this legislation.\n\n  This bill also provides a petition process to allow any interested \nperson subject to a major rule to petition an agency to conduct a cost-\nbenefit analysis on an existing rule if it is a major rule and that its \nbenefits do not justify its costs, nor does the rule impose the least \ncosts of the reasonable alternatives. A petitioner has a high standard \nto meet and will have to spend a great deal of money to conduct its own \ncost-benefit analysis to show there is a likelihood that the rule's \nbenefits do not justify its costs.\n  I also supported an amendment offered by Senator Abraham which will \nbe included in this section to ensure that agencies periodically review \nthe need for rules which have a substantial impact on small businesses. \nAs section 623 is now written rules will not be subject to review \nunless an agency chooses to place them on the review schedule or unless \nan interested party successfully petitions to have the rule placed on \nthe schedule. Thus rules which have a substantial impact on small \nbusinesses might be left off of the review \n\n[[Page S 9655]]\nschedule. The Abraham amendment would require agencies to include on \ntheir review schedules any rule designated for review by the Chief \nCounsel for Advocacy of the Small Business Administration. This \namendment creates, in effect, a small business counterpart to the \npetition process available to larger industries and makes section 623 \nstronger and fairer for all the regulated community.\n  I, therefore, support the provisions of section 623 relating to \nagency review and the petitioning process. I believe that a reasonable \neffort and compromise has been achieved which will not overly burden \nour regulatory agencies and at the same time will ensure that current \nrules are revised, if necessary, and terminated if they become outdated \nor useless.\n\n\n                          decisional criteria\n\n  Let me turn briefly to the decisional criteria section of this \nlegislation. In my judgment, it does not go as far as the House bill on \nthe issue of supermandate. The House bill's provisions require that a \nrule's benefits must justify costs and that the rule achieves greater \nnet benefits or the rule must be rescinded outright. The House bill \nthus supersedes, supermandates, and trumps all other previous statutory \ncriteria. The provisions of this substitute ``supplement any other \ndecisional criteria otherwise provided by law.'' Despite what the \ncritics may say, the Senate bill is not a supermandate, nor is it a \nwholesale massacre of our Nation's environmental, health, or safety \nlaws and regulations.\n  Under this legislation, Federal agencies are directed to conduct \ncost-benefit analyses on all major rules they propose to issue. As a \ngeneral rule, no final major rule shall be promulgated unless the \nagency head finds: First, that the benefits justify the costs; second, \nthat the rule employs flexible alternatives, and third, that the rule \nadopts the ``least cost alternative of the reasonable alternatives that \nachieve the objectives of the statute.''\n  If the underlying statute does not allow the agency to consider \nwhether a rule's benefits justify its cost, the agency can still issue \nthe rule--unlike the House bill where the rule is precluded from going \nforward--as long as the rule employs flexible alternatives, and adopts \nthe ``least cost alternative that achieves the objectives of the \nstatute.''\n  What is unreasonable about Congress requiring agencies to follow \nthese standards when a rule's benefits do not justify its costs? This \nis what regulatory reform is all about--trying to give the unelected \nFederal bureaucrats some guidance in their rulemaking authority.\n\n\n                            judicial review\n\n  Next, the judicial review provisions of the substitute adequately \naddress concerns that I have raised, and judicial review is granted to \nreview final agency actions. Any cost-benefit analysis or risk \nassessment shall constitute part of the whole rulemaking record and not \nbe subject to separate, independent consideration. The provisions in \nthe substitute provide for effective judicial review of cost-benefit \nanalyses and risk assessments ``to determine whether the analysis or \nassessment conformed to the requirements'' of the bill.\n  The judicial review provision does not allow judicial nitpicking to \noverturn a final rule if an agency fails to follow a procedure required \nby this law. However, if the substance of a cost-benefit analysis or \nrisk assessment is flawed, a court can and should review such a flawed \nconclusion as a part of the final agency rulemaking.\n\n\n                             miscellaneous\n\n  There are other provisions which I will not attempt to address at \nlength at this time. There is an extensive provision relating to risk \nassessment, a section known as regulatory flexibility analysis which \npassed the Senate last year, which I supported, to give relief to small \nbusinesses and a provision supported by Senator Grassley known as \ncongressional review which will give Congress the right to veto agency \nrules before they take effect. Perhaps this should be limited to veto \nmajor rules or we may risk being inundated with paperwork. With \ncongressional staffs shrinking, it may be wise to limit this provision, \nor this provision may prove meaningless.\n  The substitute bill before the Senate is a major step in the right \ndirection toward meaningful regulatory reform. Congressional action to \ngive agencies some greater guidance is warranted and long overdue. I \napplaud the administration for its recent actions to improve the \nsituation, but it is not enough for my constituents who must live with \nthe reality of regulatory overkill on some occasions. I am quite \ncertain that the entrenched Federal bureaucracy will never approve of \ntrue reform. They want unlimited authority to make rules as they see \nfit.\n  However, I believe the Congress has a responsibility to set some \nreasonable standards for the bureaucrats to follow. This historic \nregulatory reform bill is the most comprehensive effort since the \nAdministrative Procedure Act was adopted in 1946.\n  I began my public career reforming one system, and as I approach the \nend of my career, I am pleased to join the reform that is now needed \nfor the Federal executive branch of the Government.\n  Mr. HATCH.

Mr. President, the only change is that it becomes effective \n1 day after the date of enactment in the second-degree amendment.\n  As I stated yesterday, opponents of regulatory reform have avoided \nthe merits and, instead, have engaged in scare tactics. \n\n[[Page S 9656]]\n\n  One of the most recent, perhaps most offensive, of the scare tactics \nhas been the suggestion that regulatory reform means tainted meat, \nspecifically, further outbreaks of E. coli food poisoning. This is an \ninsult to the American people.\n  It is also false. Opponents know that this claim is false, and the \nmedia knows it. Yesterday, I included in my statement and accompanying \nfact sheet in the Record two specific provisions already in the bill to \nmake it obvious that this bill would not hold up meat inspection rules.\n  One provision allows the implementation of a regulation without first \ncomplying with other requirements of the bill where there is ``an \nemergency or health or safety threat.''\n  That seems pretty clear to me. That is in the bill. It does not get \nany clearer than that. It is a sign of either sloppy journalism or \nextreme cynicism, and this amendment ought to be named the Ralph Nader-\nMargaret Carlson-Bob Herbert amendment. I have listened to these \ncommentators--who probably never read the bill--and they talk about the \nterrible things that can happen and that we are all going to eat \ntainted meat. Margaret Carlson said 5,000 people are going to die, and \nthen she corrected it to 500 before the program ended. It seems that \nthe media do not worry about the facts if they have a good story. I \nhope to send a message to the media--at least those three--and those on \nthe left who need to read the bill, to read what really happens. The \nmedia have chosen to buy into these distortions in the face of language \nthat makes clear that we have responsibly taken health and safety \nconcerns into account.\n  I do not believe for a moment that opponents are unaware of this \nhealth and safety exemption. But in an effort to ensure that we begin \nfocusing on issues legitimately in this debate, I am offering an \namendment to make crystal clear that S. 343, the regulatory reform bill \nbefore us, has no effect on efforts to address food safety. Period. \nEnd. That is it.\n  No one here, Democrat or Republican, wants to interfere with food \nsafety. I hope we can lay that to rest by having a big vote on this \namendment. The words ``health and safety,'' already part of the bill, \nobviously include concerns about food safety. But this amendment adds \nthe words ``food safety, included an imminent threat from E. coli \nbacteria.''\n  Mr. President, it concerns me that such distortions are being made. \nE. coli bacteria and the illnesses that occur as a result of that \nbacteria are serious problems for the people of this country. Every \nMember of Congress, regardless of party, is concerned. It is not a \npartisan issue and should not be a partisan issue. But opponents--I do \nnot mean the opponents in the legislative body. I think the opponents \nhave come from outside the bureaucracy and in the media. All these \npeople who want to protect their little preserves are the ones who are \npeddling the false information and trying to scare people. Obviously, \nyou can scare people if you distort the facts.\n  Now that I have offered the amendment, opponents will no doubt come \nup with more imaginary scenarios. But I am putting them on notice that \nwe chose the broadest possible phrase. In the event that somebody \nmissed it, it is, ``emergency and health safety threats.'' We chose it \nin the first place for a very good reason. We want to make certain that \nevery possible response to health and safety threats is exempted from \ndelay where that is appropriate. Adding a laundry list, as opponents \nwould have us do, undermines the very public policy goal opponents \npretend they seek. This is so because it raises the possibility that \nsomeone could read this provision to exclude anything not specifically \nincluded. I do not think that is what ought to happen.\n  That is not our intent. We want the broadest possible language so \nthat we can take care of all of the situations where health or safety \nthreats exist.\n  Mr. President, I certainly urge the adoption of this amendment. It \nseems to me, as I have said earlier, based on the misinformation, \nflatout distortions, and flatout false statements that I have read in \nthe media, heard in commentary, heard on television, I offer this \namendment. It should not be necessary to offer this amendment, but, as \nI have suggested, it is being offered to make certain that nobody \nmisunderstands--nobody on this floor, on either side of the aisle. \nThere is nobody that I know of who does not support food safety.\n  Mr. President, I want to make an inquiry of the managers momentarily. \nIn an effort to get a vote on this amendment and make certain this is \nthe first amendment we will have a vote on, procedurally, I also would \nneed to amend the bill itself. I am amending the substitute. But if I \ncan have some assurance that we can have a vote without any further \namendments to the bill on this issue, then I will not proceed to sort \nof fill up the tree. I make that inquiry of the Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, I am glad the majority leader has addressed \nthe E. coli situation. I would like to check with some of the people \nwho were interested in this on our side before we proceed with this. It \nmight even be possible to accept it, I do not know. I would like to \ncheck on it further before I agree to anything at this point.\n  Mr. DOLE. It may be just a matter of--well, I will go ahead and fill \nup the tree and amend the bill in two degrees.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1494\n\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk ask for its \nimmediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Kansas [Mr. Dole] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 1494.\n\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       Strike the word ``analysis'' in the bill and insert the \n     following:\n\n     ``analysis.\n       ``(  ) Health, Safety, or Food Safety or Emergency \n     Exemption From Cost-Benefit Analysis.--(1) A major rule may \n     be adopted and may become effective without prior compliance \n     with this subchapter if--\n       ``(A) the agency for good cause finds that conducting cost-\n     benefit analysis is impracticable due to an emergency, or \n     health or safety threat, or a food safety threat (including \n     an imminent threat from E. coli bacteria) that is likely to \n     result in significant harm to the public or natural \n     resources.''\n\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays on the \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 1495 to Amendment No. 1494\n\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask for \nits immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Kansas [Mr. Dole] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 1495 to amendment No. 1494.\n\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       In lieu of the language proposed to be inserted, insert the \n     following:\n\n     ``analysis.\n       ``(  ) Health, Safety, or Food Safety or Emergency \n     Exemption From Cost-Benefit Analysis.--(1) Effective on the \n     day after the date of enactment, a major rule may be adopted \n     and may become effective without prior compliance with this \n     subchapter if--\n       ``(A) the agency for good cause finds that conducting cost-\n     benefit analysis is impracticable due to an emergency, or \n     health or safety threat, or a food safety threat (including \n     an imminent threat from E. coli bacteria) that is likely to \n     result in significant harm to the public or natural \n     resources.''\n\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I think this is a clear-cut issue. My view \nis that the amendment is not necessary. But this is an effort to have \nthe opponents who are really concerned about this bill focus on the \nissues rather than trying to frighten the American people, saying that \nsomehow anybody who is for this bill is out here trying to peddle dirty \nmeat. That was a charge made over the weekend and in the past few days.\n  I think probably it is in the interest of everybody who supports \nregulatory reform that the amendments be offered. I am the one being \ncriticized by the media. ``Senator Dole's bill is promoting dirty \nmeat.'' And some say maybe I am doing it for the \n\n[[Page S 9657]]\nmeatpackers. Well, I do not know any meatpackers. I do not have any \nconnection there. In any event, this is just to calm down the hysteria \nof some in the media. But they will get hysterical about something \nelse. They are good on their feet. As soon as this matter is resolved, \nthey will have some other hysterical notion or a figment of somebody's \nimagination, and some statement will be made, or there will be a \nludicrous charge that they will pick up on. There are, unfortunately, \nsome people in the bureaucracy who believe that the Government should \ndo everything in America. They do not want any regulatory reform.\n  They are not one of the American families who are paying an average \nof $6,000 a year for regulatory reform. They are not a farmer or \nrancher or small businessman or small businesswoman who is trying to \nmake a living for their family and all they get are more and more and \nmore regulations from the Federal Government.\n  I happen to believe that regardless of anybody's party affiliation, \nif you are a businessman, a businesswoman, a farmer, rancher, whatever, \nyou have to believe there are too many regulations and you have to \nbelieve there is some way to protect health and safety as we should, \nalso, to make certain that there is some way we can review and make \ncertain that some of these regulations never are implemented, because \nthey have no benefit, a great deal of cost, and all they do is put a \nburden on somebody in America.\n  Democrat, Republican, somebody out there will pay. That is why we \nfind this coalition of the left and the media and those in the \nbureaucracy and others who are fearful they might lose a job, I guess, \nor they might make life easier for the average Americans, who are \nvitally opposed to any regulatory reform.\n  I mentioned to the President this morning, we had a meeting at the \nWhite House, and I apologize to the managers for being late, this was a \nbill that I thought had potential to have broad bipartisan support. I \nmet privately with the President after a regular meeting. I told him \nthe number of changes we have already made, and we are prepared to look \nat other changes that are legitimate, and we are still having ongoing--\nas I understand--the Senator from Utah has an ongoing discussion with \nMembers on the other side.\n  I will not repeat what the President said. I do not want to repeat \ndiscussions of the President, but I want him to understand, talking \nabout bipartisanship, and lowering the rhetoric, this is an \nopportunity, right here, this bill.\n  There is no reason this bill does not pass this body by a vote of 75 \nto 20 or 80 to 20--good, strong, regulatory reform bill. I would hope \nthat we can continue in the spirit we have started.\n  I want to commend the Senator from Louisiana, the Senator from Utah, \nSenator Hatch, and the Senator from Delaware, Senator Roth, and others, \nincluding the Presiding Officer, who have been working on this on a \ndaily basis.\n  My view is if we were to work in a bipartisan way we can complete \naction on the bill this week. I am happy to yield the floor to the \nSenator from Louisiana.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Mr. President, I want to thank the majority leader for \nhis comments.\n  Mr. President, this amendment, in my view, is totally unnecessary, \nbut if it helps to clarify and reassure, then I will support it. The \nprovision that it amends was one of those provisions put in at our \nbehest, and agreed to by the majority leader, in order to take care of \nthis very situation.\n  Whether it is cryptosporidium, E. coli bacteria, or Ebola virus--\nwhatever--the bill already covers that kind of health emergency. The \nbill says that you do not have to comply with either cost benefit or \nwith risk assessment if they find that there is an emergency or health \nor safety threat that is likely to result in significant harm to the \npublic or to natural resources.\n  Mr. President, it is clear the bill already covers that, and this was \none of those 100-odd amendments that were accepted by the majority \nleader at our behest.\n  I believe it has been a very good bipartisan effort. It is not a \ncomplete and perfect bill yet. We still have some amendments which we \nhope will be accepted. There is an ongoing dialog about that.\n  Mr. President, I am still very hopeful this bill can be passed \noverwhelmingly on both sides of the aisle. I hope we can proceed not \nwith drawing lines in the dirt and lines in the sand and tossing bombs \nat one another, but, rather, try to make this bill a more perfect bill, \na better bill.\n  Believe me, Mr. President, risk assessment and cost-benefit analysis \nis needed by the taxpayers who are overburdened in this country today, \nand just to try to defeat this bill by phony issues is not the way to \ngo. We should try to improve it with real amendments.\n  I believe that the distinguished Senator from Utah, the floor manager \nof this bill, and I believe the majority leader, will show cooperation, \nbecause they have so far.\n  I will vote for this amendment. It is totally unnecessary. The bill \nalready covers this kind of emergency.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I know the distinguished Senator from Ohio \nwants to comment. I will just take a few minutes.\n  I want to thank the distinguished Senator from Louisiana for his \ncogent remarks. He is right. This matter was taken care of in our \nnegotiations. We have language in this bill that completely resolves \nthis problem without this amendment.\n  In the interest of trying to pacify and resolve some of the hysteria \nand fear that seems to pervade this body from time to time, and \ncertainly the outside groups--I have to say, evidently, the media, or \nsome aspects of the media. I actually have watched the media over the \nlast number of years, and I think they have been for the most part \nresponsible, but on this issue they have not been responsible since \nthis bill has been laid down, or at least those who have been primary \npurveyors of what they think this bill stands for.\n  We have over 100 amendments we have agreed to with the White House \nand others on this bill, trying to accommodate and resolve these \nproblems.\n  I might add, we have worked very closely with the distinguished \nSenator from Louisiana and others in doing so. I want to compliment the \nmajority leader for his willingness to try and make this bill as \nperfect as we possibly can.\n  One of the amendments we agreed to was described by our distinguished \nSenator from Louisiana, that he fought for in our negotiations, that \nreally solved this problem. I think it is unfortunate we have to \nresolve it again and again and again because of hysteria and the use of \nfear tactics on the part of the left, really, in this country.\n  I have to say, certain Members of the media, in my opinion, have \nacted irresponsibly. I hope that the media will read this bill, those \nwho are responsible will read it, and start talking about this bill in \nthe manner that it deserves.\n  It is amazing to me the lengths supporters of big government status \nquo will go to in opposing the Dole-Johnston regulatory reform bill. \nThe newest media myth spread at the end of last week is that the bill's \ncost-benefits requirement will somehow block the U.S. Department of \nAgriculture's meat safety rules for 2 or 3 years. That is pure bunk. It \nis apparent opponents of the bill are preying on the fear of the public \nand on individuals who have suffered from E. coli bacteria.\n  What these advocates of fear do not reveal, enforcement of food \nsafety rules is predominantly done not through rules but through \nadjudicatory enforcement and inspection orders against meat processors \nand handlers, which are explicitly exempt from S. 343's requirements.\n  What they did not reveal is that S. 343, in any event, contains a \nprovision that exempts health, safety, or emergency rules from cost-\nbenefit analysis when there is a threat to the public.\n  They also do not reveal S. 343 mandates the promulgation of rules \nthat are both cost efficient and that are likely to significantly \nreduce health, safety, and environmental risks.\n  They did not reveal that the USDA had already conducted a cost-\nbenefit analysis and concluded that the benefits of the rule far \noutweighed its cost.\n  Finally, I want to mention the most outrageous statement attacking \nthe bill in this media campaign of fear was made last Thursday on C-\nSPAN. To \n\n[[Page S 9658]]\ngenerate fear of S. 343's cost-benefit requirement, a spokesperson for \nthe lobbying group Public Citizen, contended that cost-benefit analysis \nwas something the Nazis conducted to compute the worth of prisoners in \nconcentration camps.\n  That is highly offensive. Such claims are pure bunk. They are \nnonsense. It demonstrates how really desperate the desperate can be.\n  These people want overregulatory activity because that is where the \npower has been. They control the whole U.S. population from this little \nbeltway called Washington, DC. When we come to this floor and bring \nreasonable rules that will change the status quo and cause people to be \nable to live within certain norms and restraints and save the \ntaxpayers' moneys and cause our society to work better, then these \ndefenders of the status quo, these leftists, start making these \noutrageous comments.\n  The Dole amendment makes crystal clear that S. 343 does not impede \nthe all-important protection of public health and food safety.\n  In that regard, let me just take a couple more minutes, because I \nthink this is a perfectly appropriate place for me to give my daily Top \n10 List of Silly Regulations. Let me start with No. 10, a regulation \nholding up the residential building project for a wetland, .0006 acres \nin size--about the size of a Ping Pong table.\n  No. 9. Creating an Endangered Species Act recovery plan for a breed \nof snail that will only flourish in an ice age or during the ice ages.\n  No. 8. A regulation making the playing of a musical instrument near a \ncampfire in a national forest a Federal class B misdemeanor. I mean, my \ngoodness.\n  No. 7. Fining a company for not having a comprehensive hazardous \ncommunications program for its employees. Its employees were two part-\ntime workers. That is our Federal Government in action.\n  No. 6. Requiring $6 hospital masks instead of $1.50 masks, without \nany evidence that the more expensive mask is needed.\n  No. 5. Requiring such stringent water testing, that local governments \nactually had to consider handing out bottled water in order to save \nmoney.\n  That is our Federal Government in action, at work.\n  No. 4. Denying a permit to build a pond to raise crawfish because the \nhabitat provides food and shelter to ``a wide variety of * * * fish * * \n* including the red swamp crawfish.''\n  No. 3. Barring a couple from building their dream house because the \ngoldencheeked warbler had been found in the canyons adjacent to their \nland. Just think about that. This is happening in America.\n  No. 2. Requiring so much paperwork for a company over 50 employees--8 \npounds, by the way, 8 pounds of paperwork--that they purposely do not \nhire any more people.\n  The silliest of all as far as I am concerned, for today's list:\n  No. 1. A company was fined $34,000 by the EPA for failing to fill out \nform ``R'' in spite of the fact that they do not release any toxic \nmaterial.\n  These are the type of things we are trying to correct. These are the \ntype of things this bill will correct. These are the type of things \nthat have Americans all over this country upset, and rightly so.\n  This is why we have worked so hard, the distinguished Senator from \nLouisiana and our majority leader and others, to come up with a bill \nthat really makes sense, that will make a difference, that will help us \nall to get rid of some of these silly, ridiculous, costly and really \nharmful regulations and interpretations of regulations as well, and to \ngive the people some power to make the bureaucrats have to think before \nthey issue regulations and interpretations of those regulations as \nwell.\n  At that point, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, I am sorry the majority leader, who \nproposed the amendment, has left the floor. I hope he may be listening, \nbecause there is more reason to be concerned about this than he \nindicates.\n  We hear repeatedly, ``This is not needed, it is not needed, it is not \nneeded.'' Everybody says that. Yet we are still leaving it up to the \nagencies to make the decisions. Maybe that is OK. But let me tell you \nwhy we were planning to address E. coli this morning anyway before the \nmajority leader came back and put in the amendment. There is a track \nrecord here, going back into committee, of Republicans not voting to \ntake E. coli out of consideration here. We had a regulatory moratorium \nbill proposed a few months back that came before the Governmental \nAffairs Committee. It would have stopped everything in its tracks. It \nwas a regulatory moratorium for everything from the last election on--\nany rule, any regulation that was in consideration. Even some of those \nthat had been finalized already and were in effect were cut off.\n  We had a list of rules in committee that we thought should be \nexempted, that should not be subject to that regulatory moratorium. \nThere was no exemption for health and safety in committee on that. And \nwhat happened? I put in an amendment in committee that would exempt \nrules to protect against E. coli. We had parents who lost children come \nbefore the committee and testify as to the horrible death that their \nchildren suffered with E. coli. Their children died. And I put in an \namendment in committee to exempt E. coli from that moratorium. We had a \nrecord rollcall vote and I lost, because the Republicans opposed it. I \nlost on that, 7 to 7, one Republican being absent. I lost that vote to \nexempt E. coli, with seven Republicans on the other side of the aisle \nvoting to keep E. coli in, in that regulatory moratorium.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. GLENN. No, I will not yield at this point.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has not yielded.\n  Mr. GLENN. I will not yield.\n  We hear it is not needed. We hear that such rules are exempted in \nthis bill--but it still leaves it up to the agency. What if we have \nsomebody in the agency who does not want to do this? I am not going to \nmake too much out of that because, we have to trust the people in the \nagencies. But to say that we should have no concern, that nobody on \nthis floor, nobody in the whole U.S. Senate is against health and \nsafety rules when we had a vote in committee that prevented rules \naddressing E. coli and cryptosporidium, which was another vote, from \nbeing exempted from that moratorium is just not right. There is very, \nvery good reason why we are concerned about this.\n  We did not have a single Democratic vote that was against exempting \nthese important rules, but we did have votes on the Republican side \nthat prevented that exemption being made in committee. That is the \nreason we are concerned about this. This is not something we are making \nup. It is not something fictitious. It showed the intent on the other \nside, at least in that case, under the regulatory moratorium, of not \nbeing willing to give one inch on this issue.\n Not even when we have about 250 deaths a year, and over 20,000 people \nmade ill by E. coli bacteria every year.\n\n  Further, under this bill, there are still problems even if the agency \ndeclares an emergency. An emergency exemption is provided, and I agree \nand I know the Senator from Louisiana is going to say that the agency \nhas the discretion to exempt these rules, and they can. But the bill \nnow says that within 180 days of putting the rule out, the agency has \nto go back and do the cost-benefit analysis and risk assessment. Even \nwith that kind of an exemption by the agency, I do not know whether \nthey can do a cost-benefit analysis or whole risk assessment in 180 \ndays. That is very difficult. Sometimes these things take years--2, 3, \nor 4 years or more. If they cannot complete the work required what \nhappens then? And even then, these rules would still be subject to the \npetition process. The agencies might have to review the rule again, \nwhich is subject in turn to judicial review, or judicial challenge, \nanywhere along the line. So there are still weaknesses and there are \nareas where we are still concerned about this.\n  But I come back to why we are concerned about this. We are not \ndigging up things. We are not desperate. We are not wild-eyed leftists \nover here. We are trying to protect the people of this country from E. \ncoli in this particular case. I think the majority leader has \n\n[[Page S 9659]]\naddressed some of the problem with this. Maybe it is sufficient. I do \nnot know. We will have to talk it over a little bit to see what we want \nto do on this.\n  But there is very, very good reason why I personally had concern \nabout this. It is heartwrenching to sit in the committee and hear \nmothers and fathers come before the committee talking about how they \nlost their children to E. coli.\n  We see statistics. We know that there are estimates that about 4 \npercent of the meat is tainted. So you had better cook it well. I will \ntell you that. Four percent--that means that 1 out of every 25 times \nyou buy a hamburger, it could be tainted. We want to protect the people \nof this country against that kind of meat contamination, if we can. Of \ncourse, we do. We brought this up in committee. We could not get that \nexemption through in the committee. It was not exempted from the \nmoratorium. That is the reason we are concerned about this.\n  So this is not something fictitious. This is something that we have \nalready voted on in committee. The Republicans voted solidly on the \nother side to not exempt E. coli from that regulatory moratorium that \nwas proposed at that time. The regulatory moratorium still has not been \ncompleted, because we have not gone to conference with the House yet.\n  I still have some concern about the processes under this bill, S. \n343, that would require that within 180 days a cost-benefit and risk \nassessment would have to be done for rules that have been issued under \nthis exemption. I do not know whether that can be done. But if it is \nnot done, what would happen then? It would still be subject to \npetitions to review the rule all over again, even though everybody can \nsay E. coli is a danger to the health and safety of the people of this \ncountry. Yet, in committee Republicans voted against exempting that; \nvoted to not give the protection that the people of this country \ndeserve.\n  So I am glad that the majority leader has done what he has done this \nmorning. We will have to discuss whether we think this goes far enough. \nBut there is very good reason why we are concerned about this. Our \nconcerns are not fictitious, not something we are making up, and it is \nnot something where politics is involved. It is the health and safety \nof the people of this country. It is not because of politics, as the \nmajority leader indicated a little while ago, that we are talking about \nE. coli. And an exemption is needed. The vote in committee showed that \nwe needed legislation in this regard. So we will see whether we think \nit is adequate or not.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from \nLouisiana.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Mr. President, the problem with this bill is that the \nopponents are not willing to take yes for an answer. I do not know what \nhappened in committee. I do not know whether the Republicans were \nopposed or were not opposed to some particular provision on E. coli \nbacteria. But I am telling you.\n  Mr. ROTH. Will the distinguished Senator yield a moment on that \npoint?\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Yes, for a question.\n  Mr. ROTH. I wanted to make a statement on what happened in the \ncommittee.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. If the Senator will let me make a few comments, I will \nyield the floor.\n  Mr. ROTH. All right.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. The point is not what has happened in past history. We \nare dealing with what this bill says now here. I and my staff worked \nwith the majority leader on this very provision to take care of not \nonly E. coli, not only cryptosporidium, not only Ebola virus, but all \npublic safety threats so that we exempted from any cost-benefit \nanalysis or any risk assessment if it is impractical due to an \nemergency or health or safety threat that is likely to result in \nsignificant harm to the public or natural resources.\n  Mr. President, what could be more clear than that? If it is a threat \nto public health or safety or likely to result in any significant harm \nto the public or natural resources, you do not have to do a cost-\nbenefit analysis. You do not have to do a risk assessment. That was not \nin the original Dole bill. They accepted this amendment. Now they do \nnot want to take yes for an answer.\n  Mr. President, we need to get this bill to be really considered for \nwhat it says. I just received a statement of administration policy on \nthis Comprehensive Regulatory Reform Act which I must tell you, Mr. \nPresident, I find offensive. I think it is disingenuous. I sat in the \nroom with Sally Katzen who is head of the OIRA. She came up with some \nvery good suggestions among which was a method--I call it the Katzen \nfix--whereby we could combine all of the scheduling of rules to be \nconsidered, of look backs of the petition process to have it all \nconsidered at the same time with that schedule controlled by the \nAdministrator. We accepted this suggestion completely--Senator Dole and \nhis staff, and Senator Hatch and others. And now I find that this is \nunacceptable and agencies are overwhelmed with petitions and the \nlapsing of effective regulations. It is just disingenuous because they \naccepted the very proposals which were made.\n  Let us get serious about this bill, Mr. President. Look. This bill is \nnot about E. coli bacteria or about cryptosporidium. Those are scare \ntactics. That has been taken care of in this bill. There may be a lot \nof things to oppose on real grounds. But I think we ought to get real \nabout it. We ought to be ingenuous about our opposition, those who \npropose various provisions. And if there is a real problem with \ncryptosporidium or E. coli, why do not you offer the amendment? Let us \nsee if we can work it out rather than come in on the floor with white-\nhot debate and mothers with children who die from various things. We \nare just as concerned about that, those of us who want regulatory \nreform, as anybody in this Chamber. And we have taken care of it. To \nsuggest that it is not taken care of is just not ingenuous, Mr. \nPresident.\n  We need regulatory reform. We need bipartisan regulatory reform. If \nthere are serious amendments, let us consider them on their merits and \nnot on the basis of something that is not in this bill.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from \nDelaware.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, what the distinguished Senator from \nLouisiana has just said is exactly on point. What we are seeking to do \nis to make this a cleaner environment for all people. What has happened \ntoo often by scare tactics is that we find actions being taken that are \nunnecessary and unwarranted. The Senator is absolutely right. There is \nlanguage already in the proposed legislation that will take care of \nthese emergencies where there is a threat to health and safety. And \nthere is no way. It is totally impossible to eliminate where all of \nthose threats are going to arise in the future. That is the reason for \nthe general language that, where there is an emergency or a problem of \nhealth and safety, an exemption, an exception, is made to the \nrequirements of the legislation. But the basic purpose of the \nlegislation is to ensure that we do a better job of regulating, of \neliminating the risks and problems faced by this Nation. It is already \ncosting every American family something like $6,000 a year. We need to \nensure that those dollars are well spent, that we get the biggest bang \nfor the buck.\n  Just let me point out that what exists in this legislation also \nexisted in the moratorium. The moratorium provided that the President \nhad the right to exempt health and safety regulations from the \nmoratorium. That would include various diseases, E. coli or whatever \nelse might be of emergency nature. The important point was that when \nthe Republicans voted the way they did they were relying on the general \nlanguage. I do not care how many amendments we add. I support the \namendment of the distinguished majority leader. But legally, it is not \nnecessary.\n  Would not the Senator from Louisiana agree with that?\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Mr. President, I will say in response that really the \nmajority leader's amendment adds nothing to what is already in the bill \nexcept it says including E. coli. Health including E. coli. A health \nthreat already included E. coli. It already includes \n\n[[Page S 9660]]\ncryptosporidium. It also includes the Ebola virus. It already includes \neverything that is encompassed in the world health.\n  So it is totally unnecessary. But if it reassures somebody that now \nwe are taking care of E. coli, so much the better.\n  Mr. ROTH. I could not agree more. I personally intend to support the \namendment of the distinguished majority leader. But the important point \nis that in this legislation we want to deal with not only the threats \nwe face today but we face in the future. That is the reason for the \ngeneral legislation. Who knows what horrible disease may develop \nsometime in the future. That is the purpose of the language in this \nlegislation.\n  So I just want to say I agree with what the distinguished Senator \nfrom Louisiana said. It was exactly the same situation when we were \ndealing with regarding the moratorium. We had general language to cover \nhealth and safety. We gave the President the authority to exempt it. \nThere was no need for it. That is the reason many of the Senators voted \nas they did.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from \nConnecticut.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, I appreciate the fact that the majority leader has \noffered this amendment this morning, not just because it clarifies that \nthe language of the bill was not intended to hold up this rule on \nbacteria in meat, which the Centers for Disease Control tells us is a \nserious health problem, but because the amendment reminds us why we \nhave regulation. The amendment reminds us that regulation does not \nsimply emanate out of a vacuum in which some bureaucrat falls to impose \nirrational rules. Regulation comes from laws that we adopt in Congress, \nthat are signed by the President, that recognize some public problem \nthat we as the elected representatives of the people have concluded the \npeople themselves cannot protect themselves from; they cannot handle \nthat problem on their own.\n  There are a lot of problems like that in our increasingly \ncomplicated, sophisticated, globalized world. It is not like the old \ndays where you basically grew what you ate. We are eating a lot of \nstuff that comes from halfway around the world. We are breathing air \nthat contains pollutants that come from thousands of miles away. We are \naffected, when we go out on a sunny day in the summer, by rays that are \ncoming through the hole in the ozone layer that has been created by \nchemicals that are being sent up there from all around the globe, and \nso on and so forth.\n  So we have created a series of protections as part of what I would \nconsider the police power of the State, which is why people form \ngovernments in the first place, which is to protect them, to create \nsecurity for them from harms from which they cannot protect themselves. \nThe inspection of meat, to protect people--and people have died from \nbacteria in meat--is part of that apparatus.\n  So it is after Congress recognizes a problem, creates a law, and the \nPresident signs it, that then, because the law cannot cover every \ncontingency, the administrators come along and they adopt regulations \nto carry out the rule, to apply it to specific cases. And this, \nfrankly, is where we have gotten into some of the problems that have \ngenerated the bill before us and the substitute that many of us on the \nGovernmental Affairs Committee supported, S. 291, now adopted almost \ncompletely in the Glenn-Chafee bill.\n  You would have a hard time, Mr. President--at least I have not found \nin this Chamber of 100 Senators representing every State in this \nUnion--one Member who will say that he or she is not for regulatory \nreform. We all have been home and talked to our constituents, small \nbusiness people, large business people, individuals who can cite for us \nan example where there is just too much regulation, but even more \nregulation without common sense.\n  My friend and colleague from Utah, Senator Hatch, has been providing \nwhat I might call the daytime version of David Letterman's nighttime \nlist of the 10 best. We have Senator Hatch in the morning, and we have \nheard these stories and they are real, and it is why we are all for \nregulatory reform. But the reason why some of us are concerned about \nthe content of the bill before us and why we seriously want to go \nthrough this process and see hopefully if we cannot work together in \nthe end to get to a position where all of us, or at least most of us, \ncan support the bill is our fear that inadvertently in responding to \nsome of the excesses and foolishness of regulation and bureaucracy, we \nmay impede the accomplishment, the purpose of the underlying public \nhealth and safety laws that I believe the public wants.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Will the Senator yield at that point.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I would be happy to yield to my friend from Louisiana.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. The Senator, my friend from Connecticut, is one of the \nbest lawyers in this body, and I consider him to be one of the best \nlawyers in the country. It is for that reason that I ask him, on page \n25 of the bill, it contains language that says:\n\n       A major rule may be adopted and may become effective \n     without prior compliance with this subchapter if the agency, \n     for good cause, finds that conducting a cost-benefit analysis \n     is impractical due to an emergency or health or safety threat \n     that is likely to result in significant harm to the public or \n     natural resources.\n\n  We have the same language over on page 49 that has to do with the \nrisk assessment. So it covers both cost-benefit analysis and risk \nassessment, and the operative language is you do not have to comply \nwith the chapter if there is a health or safety threat.\n  Now, would the Senator not agree with me that the phrase ``health or \nsafety threat'' would encompass any of these problems such as E. coli, \ncryptosporidium, Ebola, flu, the common cold? It covers everything \nrelating to a health or safety threat. Would not the Senator, my \nfriend, agree with that?\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, to respond through the Chair to the \nSenator from Louisiana, first, I thank him for his kind words and, \nsecond, it seems to me on the face of it the intention is certainly to \ncover those health and safety threats. The question is whether it is \neffectively done or comprehensively done, and I would like to work with \nthe Senator.\n  Let me just say that the other day we received the paper flying all \nover about the Food and Drug Administration comments of the overall \nbill, and they say as part of their comments:\n\n       The exemption for likely health or safety threats will not \n     permit the agency to take expeditious action to avert harm. \n     First, the finding of good cause would be imposed in addition \n     to the statutory violation finding that the agency currently \n     is required to make before taking any action, unless the \n     intent is to override the statutory finding. This requirement \n     is burdensome and inappropriate. Second--\n\n  And this is something that I have been concerned about--\n\n     neither ``significant harm'' nor ``likely'' is defined. As a \n     result, it is unclear how many situations would fall under \n     this standard. Is the threat of one spontaneous abortion--\n\n  The example they use--\n\n     or one death a significant harm? Under what circumstances \n     would the threat be deemed likely? Would the adulterated \n     product need to be in domestic commerce before the threat was \n     likely?\n       The requirement that the harm render the completion of a \n     detailed risk-benefit analysis impractical adds a further \n     level of complexity to what should be a straightforward, \n     expedited determination.\n\n  I am not embracing all of these questions as my own, but I think they \nare reasonable, and I would like to work with the Senator to make sure \nthat we do put to rest any of the concerns that are raised in here \nabout public health and safety, although I must say that I have an \nunderlying concern about some of the other sections as they affect the \nregulatory process even in cases where they are not health and safety.\n  But let me finally, bottom line, respond. I understand that the \nintention here is to cover all of the concerns, the specific cases, of \nthe bacteria and the rest, and I would like to review the language in \nthe majority leader's amendment and work with the Senator from \nLouisiana to make sure that we do just that.\n  It seems to me, as I said a few moments ago, I think we all share two \ncommon goals. The Senator from Ohio has outlined these as his test for \nwhether he will support a regulatory \n\n[[Page S 9661]]\nreform bill. And to paraphrase and state them simply, we are all for \nregulatory reform. We agree there are excesses. There is foolishness. \nBut in achieving regulatory reform let us make sure that inadvertently \nwe do not block the accomplishment of the purpose of the legislation \nthat is underneath the regulations.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Mr. President, if the Senator will further yield, I \nappreciate his candor. Let me say that this amendment was put in at my \nbehest to deal with the problem.\n It was our best judgment as to how to deal with what really was, we \nthought, a problem with the original language. This was printed up, as \nyou know, and then we went into negotiations on our side of the aisle. \nI personally spent something like 24 hours in direct face-to-face \nnegotiations with our caucus and our Members and our staff. I did not, \nup until today, hear any criticism of this language.\n\n  If there is a way better to make it absolutely clear that you can \ndeal with these imminent threats without any delay, without having to \ndo anything like cost-benefit or risk assessment, if that is not \nabsolutely clear--and I believe it is as clear as the noonday Sun on a \ncloudless day, I think it just shines through--but if it is not, then \nI, for one, will certainly help clear it up. I will solicit the help of \nmy good friend and good legal advisor from Connecticut in helping to \nsharpen that language.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I thank my colleague from Louisiana. Obviously, I have \nrespect for him, his judgment, his word, and his good faith. I accept \nthe challenge to work with him to clarify the intention of the bill \noverall with regard to emergency health and safety problems.\n  I know that the Senator from Ohio has a statement he wishes to make. \nI am going to spend a few minutes more and then I will yield the floor.\n  I do want to say in overall terms, to put in a different context \nthese two goals that we have, that there is no question that part of \nwhat motivates the bill before us is the broadly held feeling in \nAmerica that Government has become too big and too intrusive. But \nreflecting only what I hear from my constituents in Connecticut, which \nis that, I also hear from them that there are certain things that they \nvery much want Government to continue to do for them because they know \nthey cannot do it alone and it cannot be privatized.\n  I remember somebody once said--it is not my thought--the law exists \nin society in relationship to the natural goodness and perfection of \nthe species; in other words, in Heaven, if you will, there is no law \nbecause everyone does the right thing; in Hell, it is all law because \nno one does the right thing; and we on Earth are somewhere in between. \nThe law expresses our aspirations, our values, our desire for a just \nsociety.\n  Do we overdo it sometimes? Sure, we do. I have to tell you, when I am \nhome in Connecticut, I do not find anybody saying to me there is too \nmuch environmental protection. I do not find anybody saying to me there \nis too much consumer protection, there is too much food safety \nprotection, too much protection of toys. Yes, I find some business \npeople saying to me that some of the ways in which these goals you put \ninto legislation are being enforced by some of the inspectors, the \nbureaucrats are ridiculous. The average business person I talk to says, \n``Look, I'm not just a business person, I'm a citizen, I'm a father, \nI'm a husband, I'm a grandfather. I have as much interest in clean air \nand clean water and safe drinking water and safe food and safe toys as \nanybody else.''\n  I am saying as we go forward, let us remember both sides.\n  I have two more general points. No. 1 is, I am a member of the \nEnvironment and Public Works Committee. I have spent a lot of time on \nthat committee. Let me say briefly that I find there is an \nextraordinary broad base of support in my State, and I believe \nthroughout this country, for environmental protection. In fact, \nenvironmental protection is, as the writer Gregg Easterbrook pointed \nout in articles and a book recently, probably the single greatest \nsuccess story of American Government in the postwar period. It is an \ninteresting thing to talk about. Again, it is not to say everything has \nbeen done to protect the environment rationally and sensibly. Twenty-\nfive years ago, the Connecticut River was described by somebody as the \nprettiest sewer in America. Today, the river is fishable and swimmable. \nThat has happened all around America with rivers, lakes, and streams.\n  The same is true of the air, that was heading rapidly in the \ndirection of not just smog that is hard to see through, but really \naffecting people's health. I am hesitant, after the discussion we had \ntoday about numbers here, but there are fairly credible scientists and \ndoctors who say still in our country tens of thousands of people die \nprematurely--which is to say what it says, they would have lived \nsomewhat longer were it not for forms of air pollution. This is \nparticularly true of vulnerable populations.\n  There is an epidemic of asthma in our country. It has gone up 40 \npercent in the last 10 years, particularly among children. I have a \nchild who has asthma. More and more of these kids are vulnerable to \npollutants in the air. We have done a pretty good job of cutting the \nnumber of those pollutants, but still we have a greater amount of work \nto be done. I am saying, as we try to make the regulatory process more \nrational, more reasonable, let us not pull away from the underlying \ngoals.\n  Finally, one of the things that has happened in the environmental \narea is a general acceptance of the environmental ethic, as I said a \nmoment ago, and, I think, a growing partnership between the business \ncommunity and individuals and the environmental community. I am fearful \nthat if cooler heads do not prevail in this particular debate, and \ndebates are going on about other laws, that that partnership is going \nto be broken. It will have a bad effect overall. It is going to lead, \nfirst, to the kind of conflict that does not produce results, does not \nclean up the environment, but, second, I am afraid from the point of \nview of business, one of whose understandable goals is to seek \nconsistency of regulation, of law, there is going to be inconsistency, \nwe are going to swing from extreme to extreme, and that is not good.\n  Finally, if we do not get together and be reasonable with one another \nand adopt a good regulatory reform bill, it is going to face a \nPresidential veto. Then nothing is going to be accomplished. We would \nhave spent a lot of time, filled the air with a lot of rhetoric, but \nultimately, we are going to be left with a regulatory system that all \nof us find inadequate.\n  So I hope as we go forward that we will keep those thoughts in mind. \nI believe that the bill before us still, because of the petition \nprocess in it, which is an invitation to delay, because of some of the \nstandards that are set, inadvertently puts at risk some of the \naccomplishments of the last two or three decades.\n  I personally prefer S. 291. I prefer it in part because I worked on \nit in the Governmental Affairs Committee under the leadership of the \nSenator from Delaware and the Senator from Ohio. It came out of our \ncommittee 15 to 0, a bipartisan vote. It is tough regulatory reform. It \nrequires a determination of whether the benefits justify the costs. It \nrequires regular review by the agencies of the regulations. It goes on \nto create sunshine in the process and to put some common sense into the \nregulatory process without jeopardizing the underlying laws.\n  So I prefer it to the alternative we have before us, but I hope we \ncan bridge the ground and, most of all, get something done to change \nthe status quo without jeopardizing the purposes that have engendered \nthe status quo.\n  I thank the Chair. I thank my colleagues for their patience, and I \nyield the floor.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Kyl). The Senator from Ohio.\n\n\n                         Privilege of the Floor\n\n  Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Jeneva Craig, \nof my staff, be granted the privilege of the floor during consideration \nof this legislation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, we got off to a rather fast start yesterday \nand we did not get to give our opening statements on the general view \nof the legislation before us. I would like to do that at this time.\n  This is a most important matter that comes before us with this \nlegislation. \n\n[[Page S 9662]]\nIt may well prove to be, as far as impact on the American public, the \nmost important legislation we pass this year. I am under no illusions \nit will get the most attention, but it may be the most important.\n  Before I launch into my statement, I ask unanimous consent to have \nthree editorials from the Washington Post, the New York Times, and the \nCleveland Plain Dealer, which discuss the issue of regulatory reform, \nprinted in the Record following my statement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, regulatory reform is one of the most \nimportant issues before us. Make no mistake, I want regulatory reform. \nI think we need regulatory reform. Large businesses want regulatory \nrelief, so do small businesses, so do individuals. And their general \ndiscontent with regulatory burdens is, in many ways, justified. I \nbelieve that. That is why I want regulatory reform to be the right \nbalance.\n  Why do we have to have a lot of regulations? Are bureaucrats just \ndeciding to write as many regulations as they can think of over in the \nagencies? No, that is not the answer. The process is that Congress \npasses laws and agencies carry out the intent of these laws through \nregulations, through the details that are necessary to make the laws \napplicable.\n  Unfortunately, Congress passes a lot of ill-thought-out laws in \ninsufficient detail in the first instance, and then we complain \nbitterly when the regulation writers in the agencies overstep into \nunintended areas. In other words, if we want to look at some of the \nculprits in overregulation, let us look at ourselves, let us look in \nthe mirror.\n  I repeat that sentence. Congress passes a lot of ill-thought-out laws \nin insufficient detail in the first instance, and then we complain \nbitterly when the regulation writers in the agencies overstep into \nunintended areas.\n  I believe Congress needs to write laws more clearly and give agencies \nmore guidance. That way, agencies will not have to guess what our \nintent was when they write the regulations that implement the laws.\n  In other words, Congress should do the work and weigh our actions \nmore carefully, including the costs and benefits of a law.\n We should be doing all of that right here before passing legislation \nthat will be implemented through regulation.\n\n  As we debate how to reform the regulatory process, we need to ask \nourselves two essential questions. First, does the bill before us \nprovide for reasonable, logical, and appropriate changes to regulatory \nprocedures that eliminate unnecessary burdens on businesses and on \nindividuals?\n  Second, at the same time, does the bill maintain our ability to \nprotect the environment, health, and safety of all of our people? In \nother words, does the legislation strike an appropriate balance? That \nis the question.\n  Those are the two tests this legislation must meet. I believe that if \nit can meet those two tests, there will be broad support for this \neffort. Any bill that relieves regulatory burdens but threatens the \nprotections for the American people in health, safety and the \nenvironment should be opposed.\n  Regulatory reform is very complicated. The idea sounds great, but the \ndevil is in the details. Cost-benefit analysis, risk assessment, \njudicial review, the specific elements of regulatory reform, are \ncomplex--very complex. The parts do not make easy sound bites. But \nwithout making sense of the words, there can be no real reform, let \nalone a workable Government.\n  I am very concerned that in order to keep up with the schedule \nestablished by the other body, the Senate is being rushed to consider a \ncomplex and lengthy proposal whose consequences are not yet fully \nunderstood. Regulatory reform should be arrived at through a process of \ndeliberation and bipartisan consultation. That is the process we used \nin the Governmental Affairs Committee. From our landmark regulatory \nreform study clear back in 1977, through legislation and more than a \ndecade of oversight of OMB and OIRA paperwork and regulatory review, \nand now to the consideration of legislative proposals in this Congress, \nthe Governmental Affairs Committee has approached this issue in an open \nand bipartisan manner. That was our mode of operation during my years \nas chairman. And this year, under the leadership of the new chairman, \nSenator Roth, our committee held four hearings and developed a \nunanimous bipartisan regulatory reform bill, and S. 291 was the number \nas it came out of committee. Our committee report also reflects this \nbipartisan spirit and deliberative process.\n  Now, I make these points because the proposal, S. 343, that has been \nbrought to the floor has been developed in a similar open and \ndeliberative manner. The bill is based on the Judiciary Committee's \nreported bill that reflected a divisive committee, a proceeding that \nwas cut short.\n  Until recently, negotiations on this bill went on behind closed \ndoors. During the past several weeks, there have been many attempts to \nwork together to improve this bill. A number of Members have worked \ndiligently to explain our differences and what we think needs to be \nchanged. Before these discussions were completed, S. 343--this bill--\nwas brought to the floor. It is a bill that we believe continues to \nhave a great number of problems. The result, from what I can see, is a \nbill tailored to special interests. It is a lawyer's dream. It does not \nmeet the dual goals of protecting health and safety and, at the same \ntime, having a more effective and more efficient Government.\n  Yes, we want agencies to have more thoughtful and less burdensome \nrules. But we also want agencies to be effective. The American public \ndoes not want the Federal Government to be more inefficient or to have \nmore public protections delayed or bogged down in redtape and delay and \ncourtroom argument. That is why Senator Chafee, myself, and several \nothers offered an alternative bill just before the recess. It is S. \n1001, and it is based on that same Governmental Affairs Committee bill, \nS. 291, that was reported out with full bipartisan support. The vote \nwas 15 to 0. There were eight Republicans and seven Democratic votes \nout of committee.\n  S. 1001 provides for tough, but fair, reform. It will require \nagencies to do cost-benefit analysis and risk assessments, but it will \nnot tie up all their resources unnecessarily. It does not provide for \nspecial interest fixes. It does not create a lawyer's dream. It \nprovides for reasonable, fair, and tough reform. It reflects the work \nof the Governmental Affairs Committee on S. 291 and only changes this \nbill in three ways.\n  First, the definition of a major rule is one that has an economic \nimpact of $100 million. There are no narrative definitions, such as \n``significant impact on wages.''\n  Second, the automatic sunset of rules that are not reviewed has been \nchanged. If agencies do not review rules within the allotted timeframe, \nthey must commence a notice of proposed rulemaking to repeal the rule. \nIn other words, the rule could not just sit there and automatically \nbecome unenforceable. With this approach, there is opportunity for \npublic comment, and rules will not sunset without adequate opportunity \nfor review.\n  Third, we limited the risk assessment requirements to particular \nprograms and agencies. We also made some technical changes in line with \nthe National Academy of Sciences' approach to risk assessment. Those \nare the three changes to S. 291 that we incorporated when it became S. \n1001.\n  Let us remember what is at stake here. Regulation is important \nbecause rules are needed to implement most laws. There is no way around \nit. Public health and safety, environmental protection, equal \nopportunity in education and in employment, stability in agriculture \nand other sectors of our economy, each area has shown that it needs the \nhelp of legislation and regulation that follows to make it workable.\n  I would like to talk for a few minutes about a different, but \nrelated, regulatory matter. I mentioned it earlier this morning. That \nwas regulatory moratorium. We debated that at the end of March. I want \nto talk about here, because I believed many of the provisions of S. 343 \ncould have a similar effect in undermining health and safety \nprotections for the American people, their families and their children.\n  If there was ever a proposal to make one stop and think about what is \nat \n\n[[Page S 9663]]\nstake, the moratorium would do it. It would have stopped all \nregulations dead in their tracks, starting back at last year's election \nthrough the end of this year, no matter what State the regulations were \nin, no matter whether they were good or bad regulations. Now, \nproponents of the moratorium, like proponents of S. 343, are ready to \nsubject the people of this country to the slashing of regulations \nwithout due examination of what could happen, without considering what \nhealth and safety protections may be at stake.\n  We had hearings in committee, and I met with Nancy Donley of Illinois \nand Rainer Meuller of California, who both lost children to E. coli-\ntainted hamburgers. Both came to Washington intent on looking in the \neyes of politicians who were more willing to tolerate endangering \nchildren than facing up to a responsibility and making a regulatory \nprocess that works. According to USDA's Food Safety and Inspection \nService, 3,000 to 7,000 Americans die of tainted food each year, and 3 \nto 7 million Americans are sickened by food-borne illness. This is \ncosting lives and health and millions of dollars.\n  Can anyone honestly say that we do not need protections and an \neffective regulatory process? Further, I heard from airline pilots who \nwere angry that Congress might sacrifice air safety standards in order \nto appear strong not by being proponents of enhancing safety \nregulations, but by going too far the other way and delaying and even \nslashing safety rules, all in the name of regulatory reform. In other \nwords, we would reform ourselves into greater danger for every airline \npassenger.\n  I heard from public health experts who are alarmed at the threats to \nthe safety of drinking water from dangers like cryptosporidium, which \nkilled 100 people in Milwaukee in 1993, and made 400,000 sick. So the \nmoratorium would have halted drinking water safety rules until the end \nof the year.\n  But the point of bringing up the moratorium here is not to confuse \nthe issue, it is to point out that the bill we take up today could well \ndelay some of these items well beyond the end of the year. It could \ndelay them significantly beyond that.\n  Of course, rules, regulations, and regulators are not always right. \nThere can be different approaches to protecting the public from disease \nor injury. That is why reform is important. Regulations do not come \nfree. Their costs are weighing down the American people. Businesses, \nprivate citizens, universities, and State and local governments all \ncomplain that too many regulations go too far, that they just are not \nworth it.\n  So our job is to find a balance that recognizes both the essential \nrole of regulations in our society and the social and economic price \npaid by an overreliance on regulation. Finding this balance means \nevaluating the benefits as well as the burdens of rules and using the \nbest scientific and economic analyses to do so.\n  What is the economic impact of regulation? How do we measure that \nimpact? How do we weigh economic costs and benefits? What are the \nsocietal costs and benefits? Agencies need to do better in each of \nthese areas, and I believe true regulatory reform can improve agency \nanalysis and make the Federal rulemaking process work better. But \naccomplishing these reforms is easier said than done.\n  There is wide disagreement in both the economic and scientific \ncommunities about the methodologies and underlying assumptions used in \nperforming these analyses. In our committee, we heard from witnesses on \nevery side of these issues. In developing S. 1001, we tried to craft a \nworkable framework for regulatory decisionmaking. The product of our \ncommittee work was a unanimously supported, tough regulatory reform \nbill. With only a few changes--the ones mentioned--Senator Chafee, \nmyself, and others have proposed this bill, S. 1001, as an alternative \napproach to regulatory reform.\n It would improve agency decisions, lessen burdens on the American \npublic, improve the implementation of our laws, and make Government \nmore efficient and more effective. I intend to offer S. 1001 as a \nsubstitute to S. 343 at the appropriate time. The debate on the \nregulatory reform before us will, I believe, reveal many of the \nfailings of S. 343, and the more practical advantages of the Glenn-\nChafee bill.\n\n  Regulatory reform should focus on the following central issues, which \nare reflected in S. 1001. I will expand on these principles in more \ndetail later in my statement:\n  First, agencies should be required to perform risk assessments and \ncost-benefit analysis for all major rules.\n  Second, cost-benefit analysis should inform agency decision making, \nbut it should not override other statutory rulemaking criteria.\n  Third, risk assessment requirements should apply only to major risks \nassessments, and these requirements must not be overly prescriptive.\n  Fourth, agencies should review existing rules, but their review \nshould not be dictated by special interests.\n  Fifth, Government accountability requires sunshine in the regulatory \nreview process.\n  Sixth, judicial review should be available to ensure that final \nagency rules are based on adequate analysis. It should not be a \nlawyer's dream, with unending ways for special interests to bog down \nagencies in litigation.\n  Seventh, regulatory reform should not be the fix for every special \ninterest.\n  These principles would establish for the first time a Government-wide \ncomprehensive regulatory reform process. This process will produce \nbetter, less burdensome, and probably fewer regulations. It will also \nprovide the protections for the public interest that the American \npeople demand of their Government.\n  I do not believe S. 343 follows these principles; instead it does \nspecial favors for a special few--and in so doing creates a process \nthat will delay important decisions, waste taxpayer dollars, enrich \nlawyers and lobbyists, undermine protections for health, safety, and \nthe environment, and further erode public confidence in Government.\n  I mentioned the seven principles. Let me talk about each of the seven \nprinciples I raised in a little more detail.\n  Principle 1. Agencies should perform risk assessments and cost-\nbenefit analysis for all major rules. Most of us would agree that \nbefore an agency puts out a major rule, it should do a cost-benefit \nanalysis, and if it makes sense, a risk assessment.\n  Let us start with one of the most fundamental questions in this \ndebate: What should be considered a major rule? In the Glenn-Chafee \nbill and the bill we reported out of the Governmental Affairs Committee \non a bi-partisan, 15-to-0 vote, we decided that a major rule should be \none that has an impact of $100 million. A $100 million threshold has \nbeen the standard under Presidential Executive orders for regulatory \nreview since President Reagan in the early 1980's. If anything, given \ninflation, that threshold should go up, not down, if you think about \nit.\n  S. 343 has a threshold of $50 million; the House bill casts an even \nwider net of $25 million. These are just simply too low. Remember--this \nbill will cover all Federal agencies--not just the Environmental \nProtection Agency or the Food and Drug Administration. All Federal \nagencies--Treasury, Commerce, Agriculture, and so on--would have to do \nextensive analysis for every single rule that had a $50 million impact. \nOr, if the House wins on this, a $25 million impact.\n  What are we trying to accomplish here? If it is to make the agencies \nuse these important tools for important, economically significant \nrules, I believe we should keep the threshold high. If we demand that \nrigorous cost-benefit analysis and risk assessment be required for just \nabout every rule, we will guarantee that we will use up valuable agency \nresources with very little to gain.\n  One group that testified before the Governmental Affairs Committee \nestimated that the House bill would add 2 years to the rulemaking \nprocess and cost agencies a minimum of $700,000 per rule. I had some \nfigures yesterday that computed how expensive that could be and it gets \nup into the hundreds of millions of dollars. Let us remember that we \nare cutting the Federal work force and consolidating agency functions. \nThis bill should not create needless work that has little benefit. What \nis the cost-benefit analysis for using $50 million or $25 million? I \nbelieve it is going to cost the agencies a bundle of money and \nresources and the benefits are few. Talk about poor cost-benefit \nratios. Let us stick to truly major \n\n[[Page S 9664]]\nrules and set that threshold at $100 million.\n  I say let us first see how this works at the $100 million level. If \nwe see that it works well, I would be in favor of reducing the \nthreshold at a later date to capture more rules, whether down to $50 \nmillion or $25 million. But I want to make sure that what we pass now \nworks, is fair, and brings relief for the biggest problems. I do not \nwant to flood the system with so many rules that nothing works, and we \nfind ourselves back here in 3 or 4 years reforming the regulatory \nprocess once again.\n  I feel this even more strongly after yesterday's acceptance of an \namendment to include significant rules under the Regulatory Flexibility \nAct in the definition of major rule. This will add well over 500 rules \nto those having to go through cost-benefit analysis under S. 343. This \nis just too much.\n  Principle 2. Cost-benefit analysis should not override existing \nstatutes. Another question that we must decide is how cost-benefit \nanalysis should be used. I believe, and many of my colleagues believe, \nthat in no way should cost-benefit analysis override existing statutes. \nThis is the so-called supermandate issue. We all agree that it is a \ngood idea to make agencies figure out what the costs and benefits of a \nrule are before issuing it, and to see whether the benefits justify the \ncosts.\n  But let us keep in mind that this tool is far from a hard and fast \nanalytical science. There are lots of assumptions that go into figuring \nout the costs of a rule and the benefits of a rule, and many benefits \nand costs are \nunquantifiable. That is \ncertainly no argument for not doing it. I believe it can be a very \nuseful tool in the decisionmaking process, but it does show that \ncaution is in order.\n  Agencies often have to get cost data from the industry it is \nintending to regulate. And some industries have been known to overstate \nhow much it will cost to comply with a regulation. The benefit side \nalso has lots of difficulties. How much value do we place on a human \nlife? Does it matter if that human is an old man or a young girl? What \nis the value of preserving a plant species? What is the value of \navoiding an injury to a worker? Clearly, agencies should not be forced \nto quantify everything. On this point, Senator Dole, Senator Johnston, \nSenator Chafee, and I--and in fact, probably all of us--agree. We \nshould encourage agencies to estimate costs and benefits--both \nquantifiable and nonquantifiable--and make totally clear what \nassumptions they use to do the analysis. This can help inform their \ndecisionmaking.\n  But this is where we differ: Should the result of a cost-benefit \nanalysis trump all other criteria for deciding whether or not an agency \nshould go forward with a rule? The way S. 343 is written right now, \nthat is what would happen, and I do not think that makes sense.\n  First, in passing legislation, we, in Congress, have said to \nagencies, ``Go issue a regulation, based on what we've said in the \nstatute''--whether it be ``an adequate margin of safety'' or whatever. \nThe agency should not have the power to say, ``Well, we can't justify \nthe costs given the benefits of this rule, and therefore, we are not \ngoing to issue this rule.'' This would basically be handing our \ncongressional responsibility over to the agencies, based on a less-\nthan-perfect tool of cost-benefit analysis.\n  I heartily believe that agencies should tell us if they really do not \nthink a rule's benefits justify its costs. But then the rule should \ncome back to us in Congress to figure out what to do. This will also \nhelp to inform us in Congress about a law that should be changed. For \nthese reasons, I strongly support--and my colleague Senator Levin has \nbeen a strong leader on this issue--a congressional review or the right \nto veto rules through an expedited review process. This makes a lot \nmore sense than having a supermandate,'' which \nwould make cost-benefit analysis override an existing statute. Remember \nthat the congressional review of rules passed the Senate 100 to 0. It \nmakes sense to do business this way.\n  Let me give an example of how hard it is to figure out costs. \nEveryone acknowledges that it can be very difficult to quantify \nbenefits, but most assume that cost numbers are easier to estimate \naccurately. But let us consider the example from the Occupational \nSafety and Health Administration [OSHA] of the cotton dust standard. \nSeveral hundred thousand textile industry workers developed brown \nlung--a crippling and sometimes deadly respiratory disease--from \nexposure to cotton dust before OSHA issued protective regulations in \n1978. That year, there were an estimated 40,000 cases, amounting to 20 \npercent of the industry work force. By 1985, the rate had dropped to 1 \npercent.\n  The initial estimates in 1974 for industry to comply with a stricter \nstandard was nearly $2 billion. By 1978, OSHA estimated the same costs \nto industry to be just under $1 billion. So the estimate fell by 50 \npercent by the time the standard was issued. When the actual costs of \ncompliance were reported in 1982, they were four times lower than the \n$1 billion estimate. It is likely that if OSHA had to use a cost-\nbenefit analysis to figure out whether to put out this standard in \n1978, not having the knowledge that they did in 1982, they would not \nhave done it, even though it is clear to me that the great success of \nthis rule certainly justifies its costs.\n  Let us be clear on this point: Cost-benefit analysis should not \noverride existing statutory rulemaking criteria. Proponents of S. 343 \nsay that this bill does not have a supermandate. It has been repeated \nover and over that this bill does not have the supermandate. Many of us \ndisagree. Language to clarify this was offered during negotiations on \nthis bill, but it was rejected. We still do not have clarifying \nlanguage on this point. If there was no supermandate lurking here, why \nwas the clarifying language rejected? So the more I hear that this is \nnot a problem, but that the language cannot be clarified, the more I \nhave to wonder.\n  Another problem that many of my colleagues have discussed at length \nwith the supporters of this bill is the issue of least cost. Right now, \nthis bill requires two major determinations before a rule can be \nissued: One, that the benefits justify the costs; and, two, that the \nrule adopts the least-cost alternative. Let us think hard about these \nwords ``least cost.'' Do we always want the agencies to do the cheapest \nalternative? What if an alternative that costs just $2 extra saves 200 \nmore lives? Do we say pick the cheapest, and do not look at benefits of \nthe alternatives before you?\n  That is what this bill does. We should give the agencies some leeway \nto use common sense. They should be able to choose the most cost-\neffective approach, looking not just at costs but also at the benefits. \nHere, we would be requiring them to pick the cheapest alternative, \nwhich may not always be the most cost effective.\n  In talking about this economic analysis, let me say a quick word \nabout trying to reduce the costs of regulation on industry. In our \nefforts to reform the regulatory process, we should encourage agencies \nto take a hard look at market-based incentives to achieve regulatory \ngoals. Many have shown that we can achieve our environmental goals, for \nexample, at a lower cost than we do now by using market-based \nmechanisms. These alternatives allow industries more flexibility in how \nthey meet a standard. For example, rather than telling every factory, \nnew or old, that they must purchase the same equipment to fix a \nproblem, we would give them flexibility, reducing their compliance \ncosts while reducing the same amount of pollution overall.\n  I agree with the part of S. 343, Senator Dole's bill, in which we are \nrequiring agencies to consider market-based mechanisms. We have a \nsimilar provision in the Glenn-Chafee bill, S. 1001.\n  Principle 3. Risk assessment requirements must not be overly \nproscriptive and should apply only to major risk assessments. Risk \nassessment requirements are an important part of regulatory reform \nbecause many of the rules we want to address in this legislation relate \nto health, safety, or the environment.\n  Risk assessment can help us better understand what the risks are to \nthe public or the environment, which in turn lets us figure out how \nbest to lower those risks.\n  Scientists, agencies, and others have testified that it is essential \nthat we do \n\n[[Page S 9665]]\nnot make these requirements too prescriptive. Risk assessment is an \nevolving science. The last thing Congress should be doing under \nregulatory reform is freezing this science by laying out in \nexcruciating detail how an agency must do a risk assessment.\n  I believe that both S. 1001, as well as this bill, do try to strike a \ngood balance. I must commend Senator Johnston for his leadership in the \narea of risk assessment. He has done a lot of work on that. S. 1001 \noutlines smart risk assessment principles that are in line with \nrecommendations of the National Academy of Sciences.\n  There are still a few problems in S. 343, however, when it comes to \nthe specific risk assessment requirements. For example, what is \nexempted from these requirements and what is not? This bill states that \nan agency does not have to do a risk assessment for a rule ``that \nauthorizes the introduction into commerce * * * of a product.''\n  I ask my colleagues, what if an agency determines that a product is \nunsafe and should be removed from commerce? Under this bill, the agency \nwould have to do a full-blown risk assessment, complete with extensive \npeer review, before it could take a product off the market. If you want \nto put something on the market, no sweat. If you want to take something \noff the market, it is not so easy. And it will take time, a lot of \ntime.\n  I do not think this makes sense. Public health and safety can be \nharmed by dangerous products on the market. All we have to do is \nremember back to the thalidomide situation, for example, of a few years \nago, when talking about taking products off the market. We do not want \nto make it more difficult.\n  Another problem is that the peer review requirements are exempted \nfrom the Federal Advisory Committee Act. Let me state first that peer \nreview of major risk assessments I think is absolutely essential. \nScientific experts should evaluate the information put together by the \nagencies, and a good peer review process will ensure high-quality \nassessments. But how is the peer review going to be run? The way S. 343 \nis written now, no peer review would have to comply with FACA. FACA was \nset up to ensure sunshine, accountability, public input, public \naccess--in fact, fairness to all parties involved in such Advisory \nCommittee processes.\n  FACA was put in to guarantee a balance of views on peer reviews, and \nyet FACA would not apply to the requirements for peer review under this \nact.\n  The Federal Government currently uses many peer review groups, most \nin the fields of health, science, and technology. These are all subject \nto FACA.\n  The proponents of S. 343, who now want to exempt these panels from \nFACA, were strong advocates of having FACA apply to the health care \nreview panels just last August, less than a year ago. For example, the \nmajority leader stated, quite properly in my view, that ``There is no \nreason why these boards should be granted the power to meet in secrecy. \nIndeed, there is every reason why they must meet in public.''\n  Senator Grassley, on the same subject, stated, ``I ask my colleagues \nto adopt the amendment to make FACA apply, because we ought to be doing \neverything in the sunshine. If we do, the mold will not grow there.''\n  I agree completely with both of those statements. I do not see why \nthe peer review panels under S. 343 should be any different.\n  Another issue about peer reviews: Do we really need to require peer \nreview panels for every risk assessment for every environmental cleanup \nproject? S. 343 applies risk assessment and cost-benefit requirements \nto all Superfund and Department of Energy cleanups that cost more than \n$10 million.\n  Aside from the fact that I do not believe we should deal with \nSuperfund in a regulatory reform bill, I am very concerned about the \nresources that agencies would have to use to comply with this bill. \nThere are hundreds of DOE sites and close to 1,000 Superfund sites that \nwould be affected by these requirements. I do not think it makes sense \nto require such extensive peer review requirements for each one of \nthese risk assessments. How will the agencies ever be able to find so \nmany panels, for instance, that are truly balanced? How much will this \ncost the Government? What would we gain from it? Where is the cost-\nbenefit analysis of this approach? I think we should delete the peer \nreview requirement for environmental cleanups.\n  Finally, the position of those supporting the Glenn-Chafee bill is \nthat the procedural requirements of these assessments should be, of \ncourse, open to peer review, but they should not be reviewed by the \ncourt. The courts are not the appropriate place to determine whether \nparticular assumptions or toxicological data in a risk assessment are \nappropriate. The way the judicial review section is written, this is \nindeed a major concern. I will address that issue just a bit later.\n  Principle 4. Agencies should review existing rules, but that review \nshould not be dictated by special interests. Regulatory reform is not \njust about improving new rules and developing new techniques for \naddressing new problems. Regulatory reform must also address the great \nbody of existing rules that currently govern so many activities in \nbusiness, in State and local governments, and which affect so many of \nus as individuals.\n  For regulatory reform to be effective, it must look back and review \nexisting regulations to eliminate outdated, duplicative, or unnecessary \nrules, and to reform and streamline others. This review is required \nmost simply because over time, many decisions become outdated. Review \nis also needed because of the rising cumulative burden of existing \nrules on businesses and individuals. For this reason, agencies should \ntake a hard look at major rules that they believe deserve review. Of \ncourse, this process should be open for public comment so that those \nwho are interested in particular rules can make their concerns known to \nthe agencies. But this review should not be dictated by special \ninterests.\n  While I think a retrospective look at rules is essential, I do not \nbelieve in a process that would allow anyone subject to a rule to \npetition an agency to review a rule, which then requires stringent \naction by the agency to respond to that petition. That could just \ngridlock agencies and put special interests and the courts, not the \nagencies, the executive branch, or the Congress, in charge of the \nreview.\n  The latest draft of S. 343 uses a petition process to put rules on a \nschedule for review. If the agency grants the petition, it has to \nreview the rule in 3 years. That is a very short timeframe for such \nmatters. If it fails to review the rule in that time, the rule \nautomatically sunsets, it becomes unenforceable. This process, it seems \nto me, puts the petitioner in the driver's seat, not the agencies or \nthe Congress who passed the law in the first place.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Mr. President, will the Senator yield on that point?\n  Mr. GLENN. No, I want to complete my statement. Then I will yield the \nfloor at that point.\n  It also creates a process that is more prone to killing regulations \nthan creating a thoughtful review of regulations. In addition to the \npeer review petitions, S. 343 has many other petitions for any \ninterested party to challenge an agency on any rule, not just the major \nrule. These are yet more examples of the lawyer's-dream approach taken \nunder this bill. Under S. 343, someone could petition for issuance, \namendment, or repeal of any rule; or, amendment or repeal of an \ninterpretive rule or general statement of policy or guidance; and, \ninterpretation of the meaning of a rule, interpretative rule, general \nstatement of policy, or guidance.\n  And just to add to the confusion, S. 343 also has a separate section, \nsection 629, for a petition for alternative compliance. Any person \nsubject to a major rule could petition an agency to modify or waive the \nspecific requirements of a major rule and to allow the person to \ndemonstrate compliance through alternative means not permitted by the \nrule.\n  In addition, S. 343 adds another petition process in section 634 so \nthat interested persons may petition an agency to conduct a scientific \nreview of a risk assessment.\n  Each agency decision on every one of these petitions, except the \npetition for alternative compliance, is judicially reviewable. It could \nbe challenged in the courts. What a dream for the lawyers. All of these \npetitions and reviews add up to one of the worst parts of this bill. I \nthink it is a formula for true \n\n[[Page S 9666]]\ngridlock. Agencies will have to spend enormous resources responding to \neach and every petition, and then they can be dragged to court if they \nturn down a petition. This does not come close to being real regulatory \nreform. This is regulatory and judicial gridlock. This is a way to keep \nthe agencies from doing their jobs and to keep lawyers happy and \nextremely prosperous. This bill would make all the rhetoric about tort \nreform a big joke except that in this case judicial gridlock means that \nthe health and safety of the American people could be jeopardized.\n  Principle 5. Government accountability requires sunshine in the \nregulatory review process. Agencies must work to involve all interested \nparties in the regulatory process, from soliciting comments to \ndisseminating drafts to ensuring broad participation in peer review. \nAccountability also requires public disclosure of regulatory review \ndocuments, including related communications from persons outside the \nGovernment. There can be no public confidence in Government when some \ncan use back doors to decisionmakers. S. 1001 requires reasonable \ndisclosure consistent with recommendations of the Administrative \nConference of the United States.\n  Over the past 25 years, the most notable regulatory reform \naccomplishment has been development of centralized Executive oversight \nof agency rulemaking. This effort, while not truly reforming the \nregulatory process, has had a substantial impact on the Federal \nregulatory process. It led to the development of agency regulatory \nanalysis capabilities and better coordination among agencies, though \nthe record is quite uneven across agencies.\n  The development of centralized regulatory review has also led to more \nconsistent policy direction and priority setting from the Office of the \nPresident, though the record here is uneven as well, due largely to \npartisan controversy about Presidential use of that power to affect \nagency decisions. Many times over the past 15 years many of us have \nbeen in the Chamber debating the use of OMB regulatory review.\n  Much of the controversy that has dogged centralized regulatory review \nsince it was formalized in 1981 by President Reagan in Executive Order \nNo. 12291 revolves around public confidence in the integrity of the \nregulatory process. The issue has come to be known as the regulatory \nsunshine issue. And while the Governmental Affairs Committee has in the \npast been divided about how much sunshine is needed and at what stages \nin the process, the committee has always agreed on the need for \nsunshine and public confidence in the regulatory process.\n  S. 343 has no sunshine provisions. It is not like the Glenn-Chafee \nbill, S. 1001. S. 343 has no sunshine provisions for regulatory review, \nand I believe that is a fundamental flaw that needs to be addressed.\n  Principle 6. Judicial review should be allowed for the final \nrulemaking, not for each step along the way. Regulatory reform should \nnot become a lawyer's dream, with unending ways for special interests \nto bog down agencies in litigation. We firmly believe in a court's role \nin determining whether a rule is arbitrary and capricious. S. 1001 \nauthorizes judicial review of the determinations of whether a rule is \nmajor and therefore subject to the requirements of the legislation. \nAlso, it allows judicial review of the whole rulemaking record, which \nwould include any cost-benefit and any risk assessment documents. We \nshould not, however, provide unnecessary new avenues for technical or \nprocedural challenges that can be used solely as impediments by \naffected parties to stop a rule. Courts should not, for example, be \nasked to review the sufficiency of an agency's preliminary cost-benefit \nanalysis or the use of particular units of measurement for costs and \nbenefits. While courts have a vital role, they should not become the \narbiters of the adequacy of highly technical cost-benefit analyses or \nrisk assessments independent of the rule itself.\n  I believe, the way the bill is currently drafted, that lawyers and \nthe courts will get into the details of a risk assessment or cost-\nbenefit analysis. I think that is a mistake. From what I understand, \nthere has been a great deal of discussion about this issue, and I \nbelieve many of us want the same result. The question is how to get \nthere from here. Leaving the language as ambiguous as it is now is not \nacceptable.\n  Principle 7. Regulatory reform should not be the fix for special \ninterests in every program. Many parts of S. 343 are very different \nfrom the bill we reported out from the Governmental Affairs Committee \non a bipartisan basis and the alternative bill we introduced before the \nrecess. In the bill before us, S. 343, several provisions are aimed at \nbenefiting special interests or stalling particular programs. Frankly, \nthey have no place in a regulatory reform bill that should attempt to \nset a fair process, fair and equal to all.\n  First, let me say that I sympathize with those who would like to fix \nparticular problems. I know of examples where regulations go too far \nand where agencies go too far. As testimony before our committee \nshowed, 80 percent of the rules are required by Congress. It is not \njust the regulatory process that needs fixing. We in Congress are also \nresponsible for a lot of these problems. Let us focus on making the \nregulatory process better as a whole and not a fix for special \ninterests.\n  Let me give some examples.\n  This bill tries to delay Superfund cleanups. It rewrites the Delaney \nclause, shuts down the EPA toxic release inventory, provides \nenforcement relief for companies, and so on.\n  Now, I agree that some of these are legitimate problems that deserve \nour attention, but this is not the place. The regulatory reform bill \nshould address regulatory issues, not be a Christmas tree for lobbyists \nto hang solutions to whatever problems they may have. Let us look at \nsome of these provisions a little more carefully.\n  First, delays and higher costs for environmental cleanups. Every \nSuperfund and Department of Energy cleanup that costs more than $10 \nmillion would have to go through a risk assessment and cost-benefit \nanalysis. This is not just for activities that will be starting up, not \njust for new projects. It covers cleanups that are already under way. \nEPA and DOE will have to stop any progress they are making to go back \nand do additional costly analyses. This is guaranteed to slow the pace \nof cleanup even further, something we have all been concerned about for \na long time. EPA estimates that 600 to 1,000 Superfund cleanups spread \nacross every State in the Union would be caught in this requirement. \nThe Department of Energy estimates that about 300 cleanups would be \naffected. Does this make any sense? I would prefer to spend the \ntaxpayers' money on cleanup rather than repetitious, redundant studies \nand more lawsuits.\n  To make matters even worse, these cleanups have to go through the \nhoops of the decisional criteria, yet another supermandate in this \nbill. For each $10 million cleanup, agencies would have to prove that \nthe benefits of the activity justify the costs, the activity employs \nflexible alternatives, and the activity adopts the least cost \nalternative.\n  Now, I and many others here recognize the need for Superfund reform, \nand we worked hard on that last Congress. That is where this provision \nbelongs, under Superfund reform, not regulatory reform. If we are going \nto fix the problem, let us fix it right. Adding new burdens and hurdles \nis certainly not the right approach.\n  Second, gutting of the toxics release inventory, the TRI. The TRI is \nintended to provide the public with information about chemicals being \nreleased into their local environment. This bill would fundamentally \nchange the way the TRI works and would swamp the agency. In reforming \nthe regulatory process, we are trying to encourage agencies to use \nflexible approaches to regulation and make the agencies more efficient. \nThe TRI currently provides information to the public and encourages the \nvoluntary reduction of toxic emissions through whatever means a company \nchooses to use. This program has not only provided maximum flexibility \nto companies, but it has also resulted in significant reductions in \nemissions. Since 1988, companies have reported a decrease in emissions \nof listed chemicals of more than 2 billion pounds a year. In this bill, \nwe would change the standard for removing chemicals from the list. We \nwould force EPA to perform thousands of site-specific risk assessments \nin a very short time. This sounds less like regulatory reform and more \nlike make-work for \n\n[[Page S 9667]]\nthe agency. If Congress wants to change the standard in TRI, we should \ndo it in the context of Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know \nAct legislation. This provision has no place being in this bill.\n  Third, repeal of the Delaney clause. You will get no argument from me \nthat it is time to change the Delaney clause. It should have been done \na long time ago. But this regulatory reform bill does not fix it. I \nbelieve this is just one more case of a very important and substantive \narea that should be dealt with outside the context of regulatory \nreform.\n  In conclusion, I want regulatory reform, but S. 343 does not provide \nbalanced regulatory reform. Its overall impact will be to swamp the \nagencies to the point of ineffectiveness, provide lots of jobs for lots \nof lawyers, and to make some companies very happy.\n  I would like to work hard with everyone here, all my colleagues, to \nmake a good, fair and truly balanced regulatory reform bill.\n  So I hope we can address many of the issues I have raised today. I \nurge everyone to take a hard look at the regulatory reform approaches \nin the Dole-Johnston and the Glenn-Chafee bills and then ask \nyourselves: Are we relieving regulatory burden on industries and \nindividuals? Are we protecting the environment and health and safety of \nthe American people?\n  We must work together in a true bipartisan spirit to meet these two \nessential goals of regulatory reform. Together we can truly improve how \nour Government works.\n  Mr. President, I asked consent earlier for insertions into the \nRecord. I will ask for one more. We have a letter that was addressed to \nboth leaders, the majority and minority side, from the Department of \nAgriculture. I think it is worth including in the Record also. I ask \nunanimous consent that that letter be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                        Department of Agriculture,\n\n\n                                      Office of the Secretary,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, July 11, 1995.\n     Hon. Robert Dole,\n     Majority Leader, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Bob: I am writing in regard to the effect that S. 343 \n     would have on the efforts of the Department of Agriculture \n     (USDA) to improve the meat and poultry inspection system and \n     the safety of the nation's supply of food. The Food Safety \n     and Inspection Service (FSIS) published a proposed rule to \n     significantly reform the federal inspection system by \n     requiring the adoption of science-based Hazard Analysis and \n     Critical Control Point (HACCP) procedures. S. 343 would \n     needlessly delay USDA's efforts to reform the meat and \n     poultry inspection system.\n       Foodborne pathogens in meat and poultry products, such as \n     E. coli, Salmonella and Listeria are believed to cost the \n     nation billions of dollars from lost productivity, medical \n     costs, and death. The virulent E. coli bacteria alone is \n     estimated to cause 20,000 illnesses and 500 deaths annually. \n     Young children and the elderly are particularly vulnerable to \n     foodborne pathogens and therefore at greatest risk.\n       On February 3, 1995, USDA proposed reform of the federal \n     meat and poultry inspection system to incorporate science \n     into its inspection system. USDA's proposal would require the \n     use of scientific testing and systematic measures to directly \n     target and reduce harmful bacteria. The goal is simple: to \n     improve food safety and to reduce the risk of foodborne \n     illness from consumption of meat and poultry products.\n       Under the proposal, the Nation's 9,000 federally inspected \n     slaughter and processing plants would be required to adopt \n     science-based HACCP procedures. Targets would be set for \n     reducing the incidence of contamination of raw meat and \n     poultry with harmful bacteria. Meat and poultry plants would \n     be required to test raw products for pathogens, and to take \n     corrective action, if necessary, to meet food safety targets.\n       S. 343 would significantly delay this essential reform by \n     requiring USDA to establish a peer review panel which \n     satisfies the criteria in S. 343, submit a cost-benefit \n     analysis and risk assessment (analyses) to the panel, and \n     convene the panel to review the analyses. The panel would \n     then be required to prepare and submit a report to FSIS \n     detailing the scientific and technical merit of data and \n     methods used for the risk assessment, including any minority \n     views. FSIS would have to respond in writing to all \n     significant comments made in the report. The report and the \n     FSIS response would become part of the rulemaking record and \n     would be subject to judicial review provisions of S. 343. \n     These procedures would significantly delay the essential \n     reform effort by a minimum of six months.\n       While peer review can be a useful tool to improve the \n     rulemaking analyses, the potential benefits from a peer \n     review of the HACCP reform proposal does not justify delaying \n     reform of this system--a reform that is supported by all \n     interests. Similar review has been already been occurring. \n     The scientific foundation of the HACCP proposal, in short, \n     will have been the subject of extensive review and comment as \n     part of the rulemaking process.\n       First, FSIS published the preliminary regulatory impact \n     analysis (PRIA) in the Federal Register for comment with the \n     proposed HACCP rule. The PRIA contained a preliminary cost-\n     benefit analysis and risk assessment which explained the \n     assumptions regarding the risks and costs of foodborne \n     illness to the public, the costs of the proposed rule to the \n     regulated community, and the range of benefits in terms of \n     reduced foodborne illness that the proposed HACCP rule would \n     achieve. Before publishing any final regulation, FSIS will \n     revise and finalize this cost-benefit analysis based on the \n     comments received. Second, peer review of the HACCP proposal \n     is unnecessary since FSIS has held at least 11 public \n     meetings to discuss and obtain comments on all aspects of the \n     reform proposal. Three of those meetings were two-day \n     conferences which addressed various scientific and technical \n     issues raised by the rulemaking. Third, the National Advisory \n     Committee for Microbiological Criteria in Foods, which \n     provides impartial, scientific review of agency actions \n     relative to food safety, also reviewed the HACCP proposal and \n     submitted comments. All comments received in connection with \n     these public meetings have been placed in the rulemaking \n     record.\n       S. 343 simply adds another level of review which in this \n     case would result in an unnecessary delay of essential food \n     safety reform. For this and other reasons, I would recommend \n     that the President veto S. 343 if enacted in its present \n     form.\n       The Office of Management and Budget advises that there is \n     no objection to the presentation of this report to the \n     Congress.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                     Dan Glickman,\n                                                        Secretary.\n\n  Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, I quote some from that Record, in closing, \nto show how some of these things can work. They address E. coli, \nsalmonella, and some other things we addressed earlier on the floor \ntoday.\n  In this letter from the Secretary of Agriculture, he points out some \nof the difficulties. He says:\n\n       I am writing in regard to the effect that S. 343 would have \n     on the efforts of the Department of Agriculture to improve \n     the meat and poultry inspection system and the safety of the \n     Nation's supply of food. The Food Safety and Inspection \n     Service published a proposed rule to significantly reform the \n     Federal inspection system by requiring the adoption of \n     science-based Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Point \n     procedures. S. 343 would needlessly delay USDA's efforts to \n     reform the meat and poultry inspection system.\n       Foodborne pathogens in meat and poultry products, such as \n     E. coli, Salmonella and Listeria, are believed to cost the \n     Nation billions of dollars from lost productivity, medical \n     costs, and death. The virulent E. coli bacteria alone is \n     estimated to cause 20,000 illnesses and 500 deaths annually. \n     Young children and the elderly are particularly vulnerable to \n     foodborne pathogens and therefore at greatest risk.\n       On February 3, 1995, USDA proposed reform of the Federal \n     meat and poultry inspection system to incorporate science \n     into its inspection system.

But I \nwanted to get my views in. We did not have opening statements \nyesterday. I think I have laid out today the major differences between \nS. 343, the bill before us now, and S. 1001. S. 1001 is based on the \nbill that came out of the Governmental Affairs Committee on a 15-0 \nunanimous vote, except for the three changes I mentioned, which are \nimprovements to the bill.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. GLENN. I hope people will look very carefully at these \ndifferences and, at the appropriate time, we may want to recommend or \nmay submit as a substitute S. 1001. I yield the floor.\n                               Exhibit  1\n\n                [From the Washington Post, July 6, 1995]\n\n                         Regulating Regulation\n\n       The Senate is about to embark on a major debate over \n     regulatory reform. The fundamental issue is how much weight \n     to give to costs in measuring the costs and benefits of \n     regulation. The principal bill is sponsored by Majority \n     Leader Bob Dole. Its backers say, we think with cause, that \n     in the last 25 to 30 years particularly, too many federal \n     regulations of too many kinds have been issued without \n     sufficient regard to cost. That's partly because these costs \n     don't show up in any budget. The politicians can impose them, \n     and for all practical political purposes, they disappear.\n       The legislation seeks to impose greater discipline by \n     requiring more use of both risk assessment and cost-benefit \n     analysis, the first to lay out more clearly the risks that \n     each rule is meant to abate, the second to compare the \n     expected benefits and costs of compliance. It would then \n     require a finding that the benefits are somehow commensurate \n     with the costs.\n       All that's to the good; the only problem is that regulatory \n     matters are rarely that tidy. Among much else, they often \n     involve a great deal of scientific guesswork, and the \n     benefits--of a cleaner lake, for example--often can't be \n     quantified. The questions are further complicated when the \n     winners and losers aren't the same people. Whether or not to \n     issue a particular rule will always be in part a value \n     judgment. The cost of compliance should be a larger factor in \n     reaching such judgments than it has often been in the past; \n     it should not be the only factor. That's the policy zone that \n     this bill seeks to define.\n       It isn't easy. The bill now forbids an agency to issue a \n     major rule without a finding that the benefits ``justify'' \n     the costs. Some deregulatory advocates think that's too weak \n     a word and want the bill to read ``outweigh'' instead. The \n     bill says that, in requiring the weighing of benefits against \n     costs, the intent is not to ``supersede'' but to \n     ``supplement'' the ``decisional critera'' in other statutes. \n     Environmentalists and the administration say that's a word \n     game and that the bill would still override the other \n     statutes--clean air, clean water and all the rest--because \n     the supplementary standard would still have to be met. The \n     bill suggests in one place that courts could toss out agency \n     actions only if arbitrary or capricous--the current \n     standard--but elsewhere says the agency actions would also \n     have to be supported by ``substantial evidence,'' a higher \n     standard.\n       Our own sense is that regulating regulation may turn out to \n     be as hard as regulating anything else, which suggests that \n     there's a limit to what can likely be constructively \n     accomplished by this bill. To require as clear a statement as \n     possible of the risks to which a rule is addressed (how \n     serious are they? how sure can we be?) as well as the likely \n     costs and benefits of compliance (and of rival approaches) is \n     absolutely the right thing to do. To insist that an agency \n     demonstrate that a rule is sensible policy--plainly, that's \n     right as well.\n       The question is, demonstrate where and to whom? The bill is \n     set up to be enforced through litigation. The courts would \n     become the arbiters of whether benefits had been shown to \n     ``justify'' costs--but the courts are the wrong place to make \n     such judgments. There's a better idea in a rival bill; when a \n     major rule is issued, sent it first to Congress, which would \n     have, say, 45 days in which to veto it or let it take effect. \n     It's Congress, after all, that passed the laws that gave rise \n     to the regulations. Since these are essentially political \n     judgments anyway, let Congress also be the one, on the \n     strength of all the studies this bill would require, to bless \n     or block the results. That's the right way to do it.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                [From the New York Times, July 7, 1995]\n\n                    Overkill in Revising Regulation\n\n       Senator Bob Dole's bill to reform regulatory procedures \n     would erect needless obstacles to adopting Federal health, \n     safety and environmental rules. Its excessive provisions \n     invite filibuster by angry Democrats and a Presidential veto. \n     The majority leader could exercise better leadership by \n     joining forces with John Glenn, Democrat of Ohio, whose \n     alternative bill would bring common sense to Federal rules, \n     not extinguish them.\n       Both Mr. Dole and Mr. Glenn start off right by requiring \n     Federal agencies to weigh benefits against costs to weed out \n     regulations that do more harm than good. The calculations are \n     necessarily inexact, especially where non-quantifiable \n     benefits, like the value of clean air over the Grand Canyon, \n     are involved. But forcing agencies to explain the pros and \n     cons of rules and justify their wisdom gives the public vital \n     information.\n       The problem with the Dole bill, co-sponsored by Senator J. \n     Bennett Johnston, Democrat of Louisiana, is that its complex \n     language would not fulfill promises made by the sponsors. Mr. \n     Dole says his bill would not override existing health and \n     safety laws that explicitly forbid balancing benefits against \n     costs nor invite judicial challenge of the minute procedures \n     by which agencies conduct their analyses. But the actual \n     words and likely impact of the bill provide no decisive \n     protections.\n       The bill builds in elaborate petition rights by which \n     regulated industries can force review of existing \n     regulations. That will allow the affected industries to tie \n     up regulations in court and bury agencies in costly \n     administrative reviews. The bill also establishes seemingly \n     contradictory standards. In some sections it tells agencies \n     to pick rules that generate large benefits relative to their \n     costs, but in other places it favors rules that simply \n     minimize cost.\n       Mr. Glenn's bill fixes many of these missteps. It would \n     allow industry to challenge only arbitrary or capricious \n     rules, and not procedural miscues. It would cut \n     administrative burdens by limiting cost-benefit analysis to \n     major rules. Mr. Glenn would protect against overzealous \n     rule-making by subjecting new rules to review by outside \n     experts and giving Congress 45 days to review major rules \n     before they go into effect. That puts Congress, rather than \n     the courts, in charge.\n       There is no problem with the existing regulatory system \n     that warrants Mr. Dole's radical approach. Why not start with \n     the Glenn bill, and do more later if necessary?\n                                                                    ____\n\n                 [From the Plain Dealer, July 9, 1995]\n\n                         Reason and Regulation\n\n       Sen. John Glenn, a longtime aficionado of dry but important \n     issues, is not about to change his image with his latest \n     mission; a bid to temper legislation that would weaken the \n     federal government's power to impose regulations.\n       But however unglamorous his latest crusade may be, there is \n     no question that Glenn is making a critical contribution on \n     an issue that is far more consequential than it sounds. At \n     stake is the federal government's ability to protect \n     Americans from all sorts of health, safety and environmental \n     dangers.\n       Glenn, the ranking Democrat on the Governmental Affairs \n     Committee, is leading the challenge to a sweeping regulatory-\n     reform bill pending on the Senate floor.\n       The bill, offered by Majority Leader Bob Dole, would slow \n     down the regulatory process by subjecting a broad range of \n     regulations to cumbersome risk-assessment and cost-benefit \n     studies. It also would make it easier for industries to fight \n     regulations with lawsuits and petitions. The Dole bill, which \n     already has been moderated a bit to draw some Democratic \n     support, is generally similar to legislation already passed \n     by the House.\n       Glenn, however, hopes to moderate the Senate bill further. \n     Though he embraces Dole's overarching goal of reducing \n     unnecessary government regulation, as well as some of Dole's \n     prescriptions, he is wisely warning that the Dole bill poses \n     a new bureaucratic risk: that the government will become \n     entangled in even more paperwork from a flurry of new \n     litigation, cost-benefit analyses, and risk-assessment \n     studies.\n       Glenn is proposing a more reasonable alternative--a \n     bipartisan regulatory-reform bill almost identical to one \n     approved earlier this year by the Government Affairs \n     Committee. Glenn's bill contains numerous provisions designed \n     to streamline the federal regulatory process, but it takes a \n     less drastic \n\n[[Page S 9669]]\n     approach than Dole's. Glenn's bill, for example, would require risk-\n     assessment and cost-benefit studies of regulations expected \n     to have an economic impact exceeding $100 million; Dole's \n     bill would apply to rules with an impact of $50 million.\n       When the Senate returns this week from its holiday recess, \n     negotiations are likely to resume over a possible compromise \n     between the Glenn and Dole versions. Glenn should hang tough \n     as long as possible, knowing that any compromise he endorses \n     is likely to win Senate approval and then be watered down \n     further in negotiations with the House.\n       The rules of regulating may not be most politicians' idea \n     of an exciting cause. But it is well worth Glenn's time and \n     effort.\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY addressed the Chair.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a question?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Ashcroft). The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Will the Senator from Ohio yield for a question?\n  Mr. GLENN. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. He will not yield for a question?\n  Mr. GLENN. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. He yields the floor or yields for a question?\n  Mr. GLENN. Yield for a question.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. I thank the Senator from Ohio. Mr. President, the \nSenator from Ohio just read a copy of a letter from Secretary of \nAgriculture Dan Glickman to Democratic leader Tom Daschle dated July 11 \nwhich he read in full which recommended veto because the Dole-Johnston \nbill added another level of procedure, which would be the peer review \nof these matters in food safety.\n  I am looking at the Glenn substitute, particularly pages 27, 35, 36, \nand 37, and I see a peer review situation of exactly the sort that \nSecretary Glickman describes. I ask the Senator from Ohio, am I not \ncorrect, does he not include the same kind of peer review and, indeed, \nthat includes on page 27 review of the Food Safety and Inspection \nService for peer review?\n  Mr. GLENN. I think what the Secretary is complaining about is the \neffective date on this. Ours would not have the same time of \neffectiveness as S. 343.\n  In addition, as the Senator from Louisiana will note, one of the \nmajor differences he had with S. 343 is making the record subject to \njudicial review provisions which could delay things in a major way, as \nhe says at the top of the second page of his letter. I might add, the \nletter was not just to the minority leader, it was to both the majority \nand minority leaders.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Do I misread this when he says in the last paragraph on \nthe first page that ``S. 343 would significantly delay this essential \nreform by requiring USDA to establish a peer review panel which \nsatisfies the criteria in S. 343, submit a cost-benefit analysis and \nrisk assessment [analyses] to the panel, and convene the panel to \nreview the analyses''? He is not talking about appeal or effective \ndate, he is talking about peer review, is he not?\n  Mr. GLENN. He is talking about peer review and subjecting it to \njudicial review.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. I invite my friend from Ohio to go back and read the \nletter. He may be also complaining about judicial review provisions. \nDid the Senator have any judicial review in his proposal?\n  Mr. GLENN. Of the final rule. Of the final rule only. In S. 1001, we \ndo not permit judicial review at each step along the way, as is \nprovided in S. 343. That is what I mentioned several times this \nmorning. That is just a lawyer's dream, as I see it, because they can \nchallenge at any point along the way virtually where we provide for a \nfinal rule.\n You can take the whole rulemaking process, and once it is ready to \nbecome finalized, to become a rule, then it can be challenged in court. \nThen you can have judicial review.\n\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Is the Senator aware that S. 343 does not allow \njudicial review at every step along the way? It simply allows an \ninterlocutory review for three limited questions. First, whether it is \na major rule; that is, whether its impact will be $50 million--and I \nhope we can change that to $100 million--but the size of the rule. \nSecond, whether it is a matter affecting health, safety or the \nenvironment, which would require a risk assessment. Third, whether it \nwould require the reg-flex for small business. And that limited appeal \nwould have to be made in 60 days. That is not to give a lawyer's dream; \nthat is to give certainty, so that you do not, at the end of the \nprocess, have to go back and do the peer review and the risk assessment \nif you were incorrect about the size of the impact of the rule. Now, \nthat is not what he is complaining about here, that interlocutory \nappeal. That is a separate thing. Would the Senator not agree with me \nthat I have correctly stated what S. 343 states, and if I have not \nstated it correctly, would he correct me on how I have misstated it?\n  Mr. GLENN. Well----\n  Mr. SIMON. Parliamentary inquiry, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa has the floor.\n  Mr. SIMON. That was my question: Who has the floor?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio yielded the floor. The \nchair recognized the Senator from Iowa, who yielded for this colloquy.\n  Mr. GLENN. Repeat your question.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. The Senator says that the Secretary of Agriculture \nobjects because there is an interlocutory appeal provided in S. 343. \nHaving recognized that both bills, the Glenn substitute and S. 343, \nprovide for an appeal from the final agency action. So what the Senator \nfrom Ohio says is that the Secretary of Agriculture is objecting \nbecause of an interlocutory appeal. My question to him is, would he not \nagree with me that that interlocutory appeal--that is, an appeal taken \nwithin the first 60 days after the publication in the Federal Register \nof the question of whether or not it is a major rule, whether or not it \npertains to health, safety, or the environment, or whether or not it \naffects small business requiring the reg-flex--that must be published \nin the Federal Register and appeal taken on that limited question \nwithin the first 60 days. Does the Senator agree with me that that is \nnot what----\n  Mr. GLENN. Well, what I will have to do, I answer my colleague, I \nwould have to get a clarification from the Secretary as to exactly what \nhe meant in some of this. There can be two interpretations of it, as \nthere can be different interpretations as to whether judicial review is \nrequired each step along the way. That is not certain at this point. I \nthink there are different interpretations of that. I believe that is \none of the areas in which we had trouble getting language clarified, \nwas it not?\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. I think the Glenn bill is ambiguous on that question. I \ndo not believe S. 343 is in its present form. We will debate that at a \nseparate time. I am simply saying that the Glenn bill is subject to the \nsame thing on peer review that he says the Secretary of Agriculture \nsays S. 343 has. Only ours is more flexible with respect to peer review \nthan his because we allow for informal peer review, and the Glenn bill \ndoes not.\n  Mr. GLENN. S. 343 would take effect sooner and would affect these \nrules more, where our effective date is later.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Now, if I may ask the Senator this. The Senator said \nthat under S. 343 rules automatically sunset. Now, two questions:\n  First, is he not aware that in S. 343 we now provide--this has been \nadded since it originally started--that any interested party may \npetition the court of appeals for D.C. to get an extension of up to 2 \nyears upon a showing that the rule is likely to terminate, that the \nagency needs additional time, that terminating the rule would be in the \npublic interest, and that the agency has not expeditiously completed \nits review. You cannot only get an extension of 2 years, but you can \nget such court orders as are appropriate, such as to complete the \nrulemaking, or commence the rulemaking, or advance the schedule, \nwhatever court orders are necessary; and is he aware of that, and in \nlight of that, would he not say that a sunset is not automatic under S. \n343 but is subject to that extension?\n  Mr. GLENN. What happens at the end of 2 years? Two years is not much \nin this rulemaking thing, as he is aware. Sometimes it takes 3 or 4 \nyears to get a rule put into effect. Two years is not a long period of \ntime.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. After the 3 years, 5 years.\n  Mr. GLENN. At the end of that time it would sunset, is that correct?\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. At the end of the 5-year period, it would sunset. Keep \nin mind that it did not get on the schedule and that the person at the \nagency \n\n[[Page S 9670]]\nwas in charge of the schedule, and so he or she could advance the rule \nas quickly as he could. Would the Senator say that 5 years is not a \nsufficient time?\n  Mr. GLENN. It took 5 years to get put into place.\n  Mr. SIMON. Point of order, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa has the floor. Does he \nyield for an inquiry?\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Will the Senator from Iowa yield for another question?\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I will yield. But is it going to come to a close soon?\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Yes.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I ask unanimous consent to extend the time to recess \nuntil 12:45.\n  Mr. GLENN. Reserving the right to object.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Why do I not take the floor then. I thought this was a \ngood exchange.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. If I could ask one more question.\n  Mr. GLENN. I could not agree to doing that. That is done by the \nleadership.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. One more question. Did the bill which the Senator has \ntouted that came out of committee by, I think, a unanimous vote, not \nprovide for a sunset of all bills with no extension at the end of 10 \nyears on the sunset provisions. Did that bill not so provide?\n  Mr. GLENN. We have changed that in the Glenn-Chafee bill.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. With a 5-year extension.\n  Mr. GLENN. We changed the sunset and review provision.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. The bill you voted for in committee.\n  Mr. GLENN. We no longer have a sunset in this. The bill came out in \ncommittee and we changed that later on.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. The bill out of committee did have the sunset and did \nnot have any ability to get court orders to order the agency to take \naction.\n  Mr. GLENN. No, it came out with a 10-year limit, with a Presidential \nright to extension. If the agency did not review it, it would sunset. \nWe now realize that was wrong because somebody could delay it over in \nan agency and sunset a bill by not doing anything. So we took that out. \nS. 1001 does not have that in there.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. I thank the Senator from Iowa for yielding.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. The Senator from Louisiana has been so involved in this \nlegislation, so I thought it was very important that I give him time to \nhave that communication with the Senator from Ohio, because I think \nthere is a lot of misperception about this legislation. I think what \nthe Senator from Louisiana just had to say in the way of asking \nquestions helped clear up some of the misperceptions about this \nlegislation.\n  Also, the Dole amendment is before us. I want to speak on the Dole \namendment, because there are a lot of misperceptions about the \nlegislation.\n  I support the Dole amendment on E. coli and other food borne \npathogens. I would like to be able to argue that the amendment is \nnecessary to protect the public health from threats to food safety.\n  But I think we have to be honest with each other. The regulatory \nreform act of 1995--that is the title of the bill before us--will not \nin any way jeopardize the safety of this country's food supply. So then \nwhy the Dole amendment?\n  The Dole amendment is necessary due to fear mongering and scare \ntactics used by opponents of regulatory reform in this town. They are \ndoing this in an attempt to kill this legislation, S. 343, which has \nbeen caught up in the politics and misinformation over the proposed \nmeat inspection regulations.\n  We have all seen television commercials, and we have seen the \npolitical cartoons characterizing Republicans, in particular, as \nsupporting ``dirty meat.'' It makes it sound like we are rolling back \nmeat inspection requirements. This is demagoguery, Mr. President, at \nits worst. There is not a Member of this Chamber that would put the \nhealth of this Nation's children at risk, or anybody of any age at \nrisk.\n  Yet, the administration and the opponents of this bill would have you \nbelieve that the proposed meat inspection regulation would somehow be \ndelayed or even eliminated altogether by this bill. That is simply not \nthe case.\n  This bill already allows agencies to avoid conducting cost-benefit \nanalyses and risk assessment when a regulation is necessary to avoid an \n``emergency or health safety threat.'' And the words ``emergency or \nhealth safety threat'' are from the legislation. Furthermore, even if \nthis exemption were not in the bill, the proposed regulation on meat \ninspection has already passed cost-benefit scrutiny by both USDA and \nOMB.\n  So a regulation that they fear is in jeopardy has already gone \nthrough this process to satisfy this legislation. The administration \nand opponents of regulatory reform somehow seem to want it both ways. \nOn the one hand, they argue that if this bill is passed, there will be \na serious and imminent threat to the Nation's food supply.\n  If this argument is correct, the exemption in this bill allows for \nthe implementation of the meat inspection regulation without conducting \ncost-benefit analysis and risk assessment. But, on the other hand, they \nargue that if the exemption does not apply, the meat inspection \nregulation will be held up because it would not pass muster under this \nbill.\n  That is not true. Because, apparently, the regulation has already \npassed the cost-benefit analysis that is required. So even though I do \nnot believe this amendment is necessary, I think it does help clarify \nthe meaning of the bill. Most important, it is going to stop opponents \nfrom demagoging on this issue and for this reason I fully support it.\n  But I think what is at issue here is this. The regulators and \norganizations in this town who support massive big Government \nregulation--and of course Members of this body who are supportive of \nthat concept as well--see their power to stretch the meaning of \nlegislation to an extreme, to do what is in their mind everything the \nlaw will allow, just stretch the intent of Congress as much as you \ncan--they see this legislation as impeding their power. They do not \nlike that. It is this power in this town versus, then, the power of the \npeople at the grassroots who want to make sure that public health and \nsafety is protected. We all want that to happen. But we want to make \nsure that it is done in a reasonable way--not from emotion but from \nreason.\n  The regulators' mindset is to look at scientific data differently \nthan the way scientists look at scientific data. This legislation is \ngoing to make sure that risk assessment and regulation generally has a \nscientific basis. It is a way of taking emotion out of so much of the \ndebate that comes with regulation.\n  There have been many instances in which regulatory agencies have \nissued regulations and then they would put together panels of \nscientists, most from academia, to come in and look at the science \nbehind the regulations that are issued. There are instances in which \nthe scientific panels would say that the science is not good; where the \npanels would not back the science of the regulatory agency that was \nbehind the regulation writing. Panels of scientists would say to the \nagency, ``Go back to the drawing board. Start over again.'' The \npolitics of the agency or the politics of this town gets in the way of \ngood regulation writing because of the regulators' mindset to not view \nscientific data the same way that scientists would.\n  The attitude in this town is to have just enough science as a \nrationale for your regulation. The attitude in this town is that we do \nnot want science to disprove anything. Regulatory agencies do not want \nscience to disprove anything. What they basically want is just enough \ndata to support a regulatory decision already made, a political \ndecision already made.\n  So what this legislation does is put in process a procedure by which \nscientific evidence is going to carry a greater weight. Most important, \nthough, there is going to be judicial review and congressional review \nof the decisionmaking process so regulators, who are told to use sound \nscience, will have to use sound science. Or, if they do not, there are \ngoing to be other people looking over their shoulders.\n  This legislation is going to make the regulatory process more \nintellectually honest. It is going to eliminate those instances in \nwhich the politics of this town or the politics of a regulatory agency \nsay which regulations they are going to write, and then scientists \n\n[[Page S 9671]]\ncome in and say sound science does not back up the regulation, so go \nback to the drawing board. There should not be any more need to go back \nto the drawing board unless a court would say that they should, or the \nCongress would say that they should, through the process of review.\n  It is very important that we have a sound scientific basis for \nregulation. But it is more important that the regulation writers are \nheld accountable, by having somebody look over their shoulder. This \nlegislation is very rational, a very rational approach to regulation \nwriting. This legislation is badly needed to make sure that regulation \nis within the least costly approach to give us the most benefit.\n  This legislation is simply common sense, and that is what we do not \nhave enough of in this town--maybe even in the laws we write, but most \nimportant in the regulations. That is why Senator Dole's amendment is \nvery important, to take some of the emotion out of this debate. It is \nvery important that we get some of this legislation passed, this \nregulatory reform bill passed, so we take some of the emotion out of \nthe whole process of regulation writing in this town.\n  Mr. President, I have a request from the leader to read a unanimous-\nconsent request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the recess at 12:30 be delayed for up to 15 minutes in order to \nallow for a statement by Senator Simon.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GLENN. Reserving the right to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Illinois is recognized.\n  Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Iowa for making \nthe unanimous-consent request.\n  What we need in this field is some balance. There is no question we \nhave overregulation. Anyone, in any field--I do not care whether it is \neducation, medicine, what the field is--recognizes we have \noverregulation. But the bill that came out of the committee headed by \nSenator Roth and Senator Glenn, being the ranking member, that came out \n15 to nothing--that strikes me as having that balance. Let us just take \na look at a few examples.\n  Iron poison--between 1990 and 1993, 28 children under the age of 6 \ndied from iron poisoning after taking adult iron-containing products. \nOverdoses of iron tablets by children can result in intestinal \nbleeding, shock, coma, seizures, or possibly death. Iron is now a \nleading cause of poisoning deaths for children under the age of 6.\n  The FDA has proposed warning labels. This bill might well delay what \ncould come, and would permit judicial review that clearly could cause \ndelay.\n  Let me give another example.\n  When it was proposed that we have safety belts in our cars, the \nautomobile industry was not enthusiastic about that, as many of us here \nwill recall. Here is Henry Ford II, in response to this proposal, in \n1966.\n\n       Many of the temporary standards are unreasonable, arbitrary \n     and technically unreasonable. If we cannot meet them when \n     they are published, we'll have to close down.\n\n  This was seatbelts. They were going to have to close down American \nautomobile manufacturing because of seatbelts.\n  We voted for seatbelts and, lo and behold, it has not hurt American \nmanufacturing. As a matter of fact, the Japanese were there ahead of us \nand we are saving thousands of lives every year.\n  Here is Lee Iacocca, and I am ordinarily a Lee Iacocca fan. He was \nthen vice president of Ford Motor Co., in a meeting with President \nRichard Nixon, April 27, 1971:\n\n       . . . the shoulder harness, the head rests are complete \n     wastes of money. You can see that safety has really killed \n     all of our business. We're not only frustrated, but we've \n     reached the despair point.\n\n  Now, all of a sudden it sells cars. Now they are bragging about the \nvery things that they opposed: Airbags. I can remember, in 1990, the \nfall of 1990, right after the election I wanted to buy an American car. \nThe only American car that had airbags on the passenger side was a \nLincoln--meaning no disrespect, I am not the Lincoln type. I am a Ford, \nChevrolet, or Plymouth. I could not buy an American car that had \nairbags on the passenger side. I finally bought a Chevrolet that had \nthem on the driver's side, not on the passenger side. Now they are \nbragging about the very things they opposed.\n  If this law were not in effect, would we have moved ahead on \nseatbelts and airbags?\n I think the answer is clearly we would not have.\n\n  Let us take a look at a few other things. Lead solder out of food \ncans. These are examples from the FDA. Final rules published June 27, \n1995; effective date to stop manufacturing cans with lead solder is \nDecember 27, 1995. What is going to happen if this law comes into \neffect? I do not know. Requiring quality standards for mammography \ntests, publication of proposed regulations are planned for October \n1995. You have people who are not providing quality tests for women.\n  What happens if this goes into effect? Cables and lead wires in \nhospitals have caused the deaths of a number of people. FDA has \nproposed a regulation to require that cables which connect patients to \na variety of monitoring and diagnostic devices be designed so that the \ncables could not be plugged directly into a power source or electric \noutlet. Proposed rules were published June 12, 1995. What happens?\n  Take another example, Mr. President. I had a press conference with \ntwo little boys with asthma. Asthma is the leading illness of all U.S. \nchildren. A young boy named Kyle Damitz spoke at this press conference. \nHe and his brother both spoke. Here is what Kyle Damitz had to say.\n\n       Hi, my name is Kyle Damitz.\n       I am 6 years old.\n       I go to Farnsworth school.\n       I have asthma.\n       I love to play sports.\n       In the summer when the air is dirty, I can't go outside. I \n     can't breathe in the dirty air.\n       And my mom makes me come inside.\n       This is not fair to me and my brothers and everyone with \n     asthma.\n       We need to tell the president, to make new laws. So that \n     all the kids with asthma can play outside all the time.\n  How do you do a cost-benefit analysis on kids playing outside who \nhave asthma? I think you have to recognize the cost-benefit test simply \nis not a workable test.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Mr. President, will the Senator yield on that point?\n  Mr. SIMON. Let me finish, and then I will be happy to yield to my \ncolleague from Louisiana.\n  The State of Illinois tried a cost-benefit criteria in terms of its \nwater and air pollution and found it just was not workable.\n  Jacob Dumelle, the chairman of the Pollution Control Board from 1973 \nto 1988 commented about why the Illinois Pollution Control Board had \nbanned the mandatory economic impact analysis. This is a quote from \nhim:\n\n       Cost-benefit analyses are expensive, hard to do. In the \n     end, you try to put a dollar value on human lives.\n\n  You just cannot do that effectively. The cost-benefit test just does \nnot make sense.\n  Let me quote, and I ask unanimous consent, Mr. President, that an \narticle of July 17 from Business Week be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                  [From Business Week, July 17, 1995]\n\n                     Are Regs Bleeding the Economy?\n\n\n        maybe not--in fact, they sometimes boost competitiveness\n\n                 (By John Carey, with Mary Beth Regan)\n\n       To the Republican Congress, regulations are like a red cape \n     waved in front of a raging bull. ``Our regulatory process is \n     out of control,'' says House Science Committee Chairman \n     Robert S. Walker (R-Pa.). He and other GOP leaders charge \n     that nonsensical federal rules cripple the economy, kill \n     jobs, and sap innovation. That's often true: Companies must \n     spend enormous sums making toxic-waste sites' soil clean \n     enough to eat or extracting tiny pockets of asbestos from \n     behind thick walls.\n       That's why GOP lawmakers on Capitol Hill want to impose a \n     seemingly simple test. In a House bill passed earlier this \n     year and a Senate measure scheduled for a floor vote in July, \n     legislators demand that no major regulation be issued unless \n     bureaucrats can show that the benefits justify the costs. \n     ``The regulatory state imposes $500 billion of burdensome \n     costs on the economy each year, and it is simply common sense \n     to call for some consideration of costs when regulations are \n     issued,'' says Senate Majority Leader Bob Dole (R-Kan.).\n\n[[Page S 9672]]\n\n       That sounds eminently reasonable. But there's a serious \n     flaw, according to most experts in cost-benefit calculations. \n     ``The lesson from doing this kind of analysis is that it's \n     hard to get it right,'' explains economist Dale Hattis of \n     Clark University. It's so hard, in fact, that estimates of \n     costs and benefits may vary by factors of a hundred or even a \n     thousand. That's enough to make the same regulation appear to \n     be a tremendous bargain in one study and a grievous burden in \n     the next. ``If lawmakers think cost-benefit analysis will \n     give the right answers, they are deluding themselves,'' says \n     Dr. Philip J. Landrigan, chairman of the community medicine \n     department at Mount Sinai Medical Center in New York.\n       There's a greater problem: The results from these analyses \n     typically make regulations look far more menacing than they \n     are in practice. Costs figured when a regulation is issued \n     ``almost without exception are a profound overestimate of the \n     final costs,'' says Nicholas A. Ashford, a technology policy \n     expert at Massachusetts Institute of Technology. For one \n     thing, there's a tendency by the affected industry to \n     exaggerate the regulatory hardship, thereby overstating the \n     costs.\n       More important, Ashford and others say, flexibly written \n     regulations can stimulate companies to find efficient \n     solutions. Even critics of federal regulation, such as Murray \n     L. Weidenbaum of Washington University, point to this effect. \n     ``If it really comes out of your profits, you will rack your \n     brains to reduce the cost,'' he explains. That's why many \n     experts say the $500 billion cost of regulation, bandied \n     about by Dole and others, is way too high.\n       Take foundries that use resins as binders in mold-making. \n     When the Occupational Safety & Health Administration issued a \n     new standard for worker exposure to the toxic chemical \n     formaldehyde in 1987, costs to the industry were pegged at \n     $10 million per year. The assumption was that factories would \n     have to install ventilation systems to waft away the \n     offending fumes, says MIT economist Robert Stone, who studied \n     the regulation's impact for a forthcoming report of the \n     congressional Office of Technology Assessment (OTA).\n\n\n                              bottom lines\n\n       Instead, foundry suppliers modified the resins, slashing \n     the amount of formaldehyde. In the end, ``the costs were \n     negligible for most firms,'' says Stone. What's more, the \n     changes boosted the global competitiveness boosted the global \n     competitiveness of the U.S. foundry supply and equipment \n     industry, making the regulations a large net plus, he argues.\n       While federal rules that improve bottom lines are rare, \n     regulatory costs turn out to be far lower than estimated in \n     case after case (table). In 1990, the price tag for reducing \n     emissions of sulfur dioxide--the cause of acid rain--was \n     pegged at $1,000 per ton by utilities, the Environmental \n     Protection Agency, and Congress. Yet today the cost is $140 \n     per ton, judging from the open-market price for the \n     alternative, the right to emit a ton of the gas. Robert J. \n     McWhorter, senior vice-president for generation and \n     transmission at Ohio Edison Co., says the expense could rise \n     to $250 when the next round of controls kicks in, ``but no \n     one expects to get to $1,000.'' The reason: Low-sulfur coal \n     got cheaper, enabling utilities to avoid costly scrubbers for \n     dirty coal.\n       Likewise, meeting 1975 worker-exposure standards for vinyl \n     chloride, a major ingredient of plastics, ``was nothing like \n     the catastrophe the industry predicted,'' says Clark \n     University's Hattis. He found in a study he did while at MIT \n     that companies developed technology that boosted productivity \n     while lowering worker exposure.\n       Of course, it's possible to find examples of underestimated \n     regulatory costs. And even critics of the GOP regulatory \n     reform bills aren't suggesting that cost-benefit analysis is \n     worthless. ``We should use it as a tool'' to get a general \n     sense of a rule's range of possible effects, says Joan \n     Claybrook, president of the Ralph Nader-founded group Public \n     Citizen. But she and other critics strongly oppose the \n     Republican scheme to kill all regs that can't be justified by \n     a cost-benefit exercise. As a litmus test for regulation, \n     ``the uncertainties are too broad to make it terribly \n     useful,'' says Harvard University environmental-health \n     professor Joel Schwartz.\n       What is useful is moving away from a command-and-control \n     approach to regulation. There's widespread agreement among \n     companies and academic experts that bureaucrats should not \n     specify what technology companies must install. It's far \n     better simply to set a goal, then give industry enough time \n     to come up with clever solutions. ``We need the freedom to \n     choose the most economic way to meet the standard,'' explains \n     Alex Krauer, chairman of Ciba-Geigy Ltd. Krauer, for example, \n     points to new, cleaner, processes for producing chemicals \n     that end up being far cheaper than installing expensive \n     control technology at the end of the effluent pipe.\n\n\n                              dumb things\n\n       But when goals are being set for industry, the proposed \n     cost-benefit analysis approach could have a perverse effect. \n     That's because agencies are rarely able to foresee the low-\n     pollution processes industries may concoct. Smokestack \n     scrubbers are a good example. The bean-counters will use the \n     known price of expensive scrubbers in their analyses. Their \n     cost-benefit calculations will then argue for less stringent \n     standards. And those won't help spark cheaper technology. The \n     result can be the worst of both worlds: costlier regulation \n     without significant pollution reductions. ``It's a vicious \n     circle,'' explains Stone. ``If you predict that the costs are \n     high, then you stimulate less of the innovation that can \n     bring costs down.''\n       There's no doubt reform is needed. ``Frankly, we have a lot \n     of dumb environmental regulations,'' says Harvard's Schwartz. \n     But he puts much of the blame on Congress for ordering \n     agencies to do dumb things. Now, Congress is tackling an \n     enormously complex issue without fully understanding the \n     ramifications. Schwartz and other critics worry. Overreliance \n     on cost-benefit analysis could make things worse for \n     business, workers, and the environment.\n\n\n                regulation isn't always a costly burden\n\n       Many regulations cost much less than expected because \n     industry finds cheap ways to comply with them.\n\n\n                              cotton dust\n\n       1978 regulations aimed at reducing brown lung disease \n     helped speed up modernization and automation and boost \n     productivity in the textile industry, making the cost of \n     meeting the standard far less than predicted.\n\n\n                             vinyl chloride\n\n       Reducing worker exposure to this carcinogen was predicted \n     to put a big chunk of the U.S. plastics industry out of \n     business. But automated technology cut exposures and boosted \n     productivity at a much lower cost.\n\n\n                               acid rain\n\n       Efficiencies in coal mining and shipping cut prices of low-\n     sulfur coal, reducing the need to clean up dirty coal with \n     costly scrubbers. So utilities spend just $140 per ton to \n     remove sulfur dioxide, vs. the predicted $1,000.\n\n  Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, that article is about this legislation. \nListen to the last sentence of this article. This is not from some \nwild-eyed radical liberal publication. This is from Business Week.\n\n       Overreliance on cost-benefit analysis could make things \n     worse for business, workers, and the environment.\n\n  I think we ought to be going back to the bill by our colleague from \nDelaware, Senator Roth. I think that has balance. I think this bill \ndoes not have balance. This bill is going to end up in endless \nlitigation. I know my colleague from Louisiana is sincere, as is the \nmajority leader. But I think it is moving in the wrong direction.\n  I am pleased to yield to my colleague from Louisiana for a question.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. I ask my friend, would he not agree that benefits to \nhealth, safety, or the environment are by their nature nonquantifiable; \nhuman life, health, clean air?\n  Mr. SIMON. They are not. That is why I think we have to be very, very \ncareful in this area.\n  If I may regain my time just for a minute, when you talk, for \nexample, in an area that the Senator from Louisiana knows much about, \nand the Presiding Officer does, and I do, and that is flood control, \nthen when you talk about cost-benefit, it is very easy. When you talk \nabout something like asthma, then you are talking about something where \nit becomes very, very difficult.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Is the Senator aware that at my behest, we put in \nlanguage in the bill contained on page 36 that says if scientific, \ntechnical, or economic uncertainties or nonquantifiable benefits to \nhealth, safety, or the environment identified by the agency in the \nrulemaking record make a more costly alternative that achieves the \nobjectives of the statute, appropriately and in the public interest, \nthat that more costly alternative may be accepted because of the \nnonquantifiable benefits to health, safety, and the environment, or \nbecause of the uncertainty of science and data?\n  Is the Senator aware that that amendment was added to this bill since \nthat Business Week article was written?\n  Mr. SIMON. Let me just add, there is no question that the Senator \nfrom Louisiana has improved the bill before us.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Does that not cover the exact things the Senator from \nIllinois was talking about, the boy with the asthma, the kid with the \nlead?\n  Mr. SIMON. I think the answer is what is quantifiable and what is \nnonquantifiable is going to become a matter of jurisdiction of the \ncourts under this legislation. I think we are going to have endless \nlitigation.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Under the definition of benefits, we have already \nincluded the quantifiable benefits. That is put into your cost-benefit \nratio. This says that this is a little extra that you are able to add. \nIf you are not able to quantify the value of life, which by its nature \nis nonquantifiable, or the value of \n\n[[Page S 9673]]\nclean air, then you can add that on and have a more costly alternative.\n  That is exactly and precisely to deal with the problem that my friend \nfrom Illinois so eloquently described, which is the kid with asthma, \nthe people with safety belts, and all that. It is nonquantifiable. It \nis human life. You do not put a dollar value on human life or on the \nvalue of clean air.\n  I urge my colleagues to go back and read on page 36 those words. I \nthink it covers this like a hand in a glove.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Will the Senator from Illinois yield on that exact same \npoint?\n  Mr. SIMON. I am pleased to yield to my colleague from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I hope also all of us will read that language which was \nreferred to by the Senator from Louisiana. But what it does not cover \nare areas where we cannot quantify the benefits, such as how many fewer \nasthma attacks will result? That is quantifiable, let us assume for a \nmoment. The value of avoiding it may not be quantifiable. But the fact \nthat we could avoid a certain number of asthma attacks, or deaths in \nmany cases, is very quantifiable.\n  We sought from the Senator from Louisiana and others language which \nwould say that where you can quantify a reduction in deaths or asthma \nattacks, we should then not be forced to use the least costly approach. \nWe may want to reduce more asthma attacks and save more lives with a \nslightly more expensive approach. We were unable to get that language.\n  So, yes. It is very important that all of us understand the point \nthat is made by the Senator from Louisiana. But it does not solve the \nproblem which has been raised by the Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, I think the dialog we have just had \nsuggests that my point is valid, that we are going to end up with the \ncourts deciding what is quantifiable and what is not quantifiable. I \nthink we should move slowly in this area. I have been in Government a \nfew years now, Mr. President. I was first elected to the State \nlegislature when I was 25. I am now 66. I have found generally that \nwhen we take solid, careful steps, we are much better off than when we \ndo these sweeping things.\n  I think what we have before us now is well intentioned, but too \nsweeping, in answer. The pendulum will go from one cycle to the other.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/07/11/senate-section/article/S9653-5", "month": "07", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "11", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9673]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 RECESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I would like to speak for a moment in support \nof the Dole amendment, and therefore in support of this legislation as \nwe will amend it.\n  The question before us is whether or not benefits justify costs. That \nis really all we want to know. Given that the Judiciary Committee's \nreport places the regulatory burden on our economy at over $881 \nbillion, I think that is a reasonable question to ask. That averages \njust under $6,000 for every household in this country--$6,000 that \nfamilies in this country cannot spend on other things because the money \nhas to be given to the Government or has to be used in other ways to \ncomply with the costs of regulation.\n  That is why these costs are cloaked in what amounts to a hidden tax. \nThey are passed on through lower wages, through higher State and local \ntaxes, through higher prices, through slower growth and fewer jobs. I \nsaid fewer jobs. According to William Laffer in a 1993 Heritage \nFoundation report, and I am quoting:\n\n       There are at least three million fewer jobs in the American \n     economy today than would have existed if the growth of \n     regulation over the last 20 years had been slower and \n     regulations more efficiently managed.\n\n  To put it in perspective further, the Americans for Tax Reform \nFoundation found that each year Americans work until May 5 to pay for \nall Government spending. If you add the cost of regulations, each \nAmerican has to work until July 10--I believe that was yesterday--in \norder to pay for all of the taxes and regulations imposed upon us. That \nis over a half year of work to pay the total cost of Government, and 2 \nmonths of that hard work must pay for the costs of regulation. As I \nsaid, that is money families could spend making their own decisions on \nhow to spend for their own health care, safety, and education.\n  According to a 1993 IPI policy report, regulations add as much as 95 \npercent to the price of a new vaccine. And Justice Breyer, who has \nrecently been elevated to the Supreme Court, wrote a book called \n``Breaking the Vicious Circle,'' in which he poses the following \nquestion: ``Does it matter if we spend too much overinsuring our \nsafety?'' And he answers his own question. ``The money is not, nor will \nit be, there to spend, at least not if we want to address more serious \nenvironmental or social problems--the need for better prenatal care, \nvaccinations and cancer diagnosis, let alone daycare, housing, and \neducation.''\n  In other words, Mr. President, it is foregone opportunity in the \nsense that by spending this money on something where its benefits are \nmarginal, we are precluded from spending it on things that could really \nbe more important and helpful to us.\n  Cost-benefit analysis, some people say, is a new and a foreign \nconcept. Well, businesses fail if they do not utilize cost-benefit \nanalysis. At every turn, individuals are confronted with decisions that \nrequire weighing the pluses and minuses and the benefits and costs. \nThese are decisions that we make every day. We call it common sense. \nWhen we decide to get in our automobile and drive somewhere, we know \nthat the national highway fatality and accidents statistics weigh \nfairly heavily toward the possibility that sometime in our life we are \ngoing to be involved in an accident in which we are going to be harmed \nand yet we consciously make the decision that because the benefits to \nus of arriving at our destination using our automobile are worth more \nthan the risks, we decide to take those risks.\n  In another more simple example, we cross the street every day, and \nmost of us understand that there is some degree of risk in crossing the \nstreet; people are harmed every day by doing that, but the benefits of \nus getting to our destination exceed the costs, or the potential risk \nto us in making that particular trip.\n  So as human beings, as families, as individuals, we make decisions, \nmany decisions every day that involve some theoretical and sometimes \nnot so theoretical risks to ourselves.\n Yet we do that knowingly, and we do that understanding that sometimes \nbenefits can outweigh those risks. It is the application of common \nsense. And what we are asking for with respect to the regulations that \nare imposed upon us, is that there be a little bit more common sense, a \nlittle bit more care to go into the development of these regulations.\n\n  Now, one of my colleagues this morning spoke, and I thought made an \nexcellent point, that Government generally is supposed to do for us \nwhat we cannot do for ourselves. Most of us believe that. We appreciate \nthe fact that in many cases we cannot as individuals understand the \nrisks involved and we cannot police everything that could pose a \nparticular risk to us. And so we ask the Government to do that for us. \nWe empower Government agencies to do tests, to do analysis, and to \nactually establish standards. Then they frequently report those \nstandards to us on a product or on a label or by some regulation \nprecluding the manufacture or use of something that would be dangerous \nto us.\n  We do that certainly in our food industry in a way that is understood \nby all, in the approval of drugs and in many, many other ways. We ask \nthe Government to do for us what we cannot do for ourselves, to \nunderstand the risks. That is called a risk assessment, to do a cost-\nbenefit analysis. Indeed, most Presidents since President Ford have, in \nfact all Presidents I think have, in effect, imposed a cost-benefit \n\n[[Page S 9674]]\nanalysis requirement on most Government agencies as a matter of \nExecutive order. The problem is it is enforced more in the breach than \nin the compliance. And so many agencies do not follow that cost-benefit \nanalysis in the establishment of regulations. And that, I will get back \nto, is basically what we are asking these Government agencies to do. \nWhen we give to them the obligation of protecting us in some way, we \nwant them to do it in a way that represents common sense and at the \nleast cost consistent with the protection which we want.\n  Now, there is an argument that has been made that the regulatory \nagencies ought to be expected to exercise the same sort of common sense \nthat individuals do. I want to make a couple points about that.\n  First of all, Mr. President, whenever we hand power to the \nGovernment, it should be viewed with a special or through a special \nlens because the Government exercises power far beyond that which can \nbe exercised by any of us as individuals or even as a business \norganization. Some call it the heavy hand of Government. But we all \nappreciate the fact that when we pass a law in the Congress, and when \nthe executive branch agencies of Government administer that law \npursuant to our direction, they are doing so under the color of, under \nthe authority of, under the color of law--the power of the Government \nto enforce that law. And we as citizens are supposed to know what that \nlaw is.\n  We all learned in school that ignorance of the law is no excuse. And \nyet there are over 20 million words of regulation today, about 36,000 \npages of regulations in the Federal Register. We cannot all be expected \nto know what those are. We do not need to know what they all are. But I \ndaresay that there are a lot of regulations that could end up \nsuggesting that we are in violation of some law that, in fact, we do \nnot even know about. That is certainly the case with a lot of \nbusinesses.\n  The fact is there are a lot of regulations. They have behind them the \npower of the law to enforce them. So when we ask the Government to do \nsomething for us, we should be very careful about ceding too much \nauthority, because the Government can, in the enforcement of those \nregulations, impose fines and impose other kinds of penalties upon us. \nAnd, of course, the stories in the newspapers and so on are full of \nstories about examples of situations in which an innocent citizen has \ngotten himself or herself into hot water because he has run afoul of \nsome Federal regulation, frequently of which he was not even aware.\n  So, when we say, well, a Federal bureaucrat can certainly be trusted \nto exercise the same degree of common sense that an ordinary citizen \nwould, we appreciate the hard work that our so-called bureaucrats do \nfor us, but we also have to appreciate the power that stands behind \nthat bureaucrat in terms of being able to enforce those regulations.\n  That is why we need to be very, very careful about the kind of \nregulations that have been imposed; and, second, because we have \ncertainly seen instances in which there has been an overregulation; \nand, third, because the cost of those regulations on our society cannot \nnecessarily be fully appreciated by the individual who is promulgating \nthe regulation.\n  That is why we want to make it very clear to the people to whom we \nentrust with that authority that we, the Congress, want them to examine \nboth the risks and the costs against the benefits to be achieved by the \nregulations that they would impose.\n  Let me give you an example, Mr. President, that occurred in my home \nState not too long ago. It is an example I cite because it really had a \nhappy ending, but no thanks to the law that we wrote and the \nregulations that were promulgated pursuant to that law.\n  In Graham County, AZ, a rural area primarily of cotton farming and \nother agriculture, there is a river called the Gila River, which does \nnot overflow very often but when it does, unfortunately, it is a wild \nriver. It flooded in 1993 in January. The flood was significant enough \nto wipe out a bridge about 5 miles east of Safford, the county seat of \nGraham County. Unfortunately, when that happened, the river changed its \ncourse and went several hundred yards to the south wiping out a lot of \nfarmland and causing a great deal of havoc. The primary thing that \nhappened was that there was no more opportunity to cross the river \nthere for the people who lived on the other side without a 28-mile \ndetour across a bridge that was very narrow, 20 feet wide, a bridge one \ncould not build today under Federal regulations, and probably a good \nthing because it is not a very safe bridge. School kids got up an hour \nearlier in the morning and stayed an hour later in order to ride that \nextra distance to and from home. And the traffic was all routed on a \nsmall State road. Since it is a farming community, the farm implements \nwere obviously traveling on the same road as the highway traffic. Of \ncourse, these can be very wide. They are 20 feet wide sometimes and \ntravel at maybe 10 or 15 miles an hour. I saw many instances in which, \nbecause motorists were frustrated, they passed the double line. They \nshould not do it. It is against the law. But clearly, health and safety \nwere implicated in the fact that people could not cross the bridge that \nexisted before.\n  The Federal Highway Program had funds available through disaster \nassistance to reconstruct the bridge, and the Army Corps of Engineers \nwas willing to reconstruct the bridge. The problem was that it had to \nconsult with the Fish and Wildlife Service because it is believed that \nthere is an endangered species in the Gila River called the razorback \nsucker. Now, nobody can find that little sucker, but supposedly it is \nthere. Let us assume that it exists. And if it does, we certainly want \nto preserve it and save it.\n  But what the local officials were asking the Army Corps of Engineers \nto do was to build up a little dirt berm, now that the river has gone \nback down again and does not flow very heavily, to redirect the river \nback to its original channel. Now, if the sucker exists, and if it \nlived all of these years in its original channel in the Gila River, \nthen presumably it can do just fine living where it always lived, and \nit is no danger to that species that the river is being redirected back \nwhere it always was. And by doing that, the bridge can be constructed, \nthe people can travel safely, and life returns normally to the people \nin Graham County. But, alas, the Army Corps of Engineers could not get \nthe approval from the Department of the Interior to go forward with \nthese plans.\n  Finally, the situation was dangerous enough, the people were fed up \nenough, the situation was frustrating enough, costing enough, that the \npeople of Graham County said, ``We've got to do something about this \nourselves. We have to take matters into our own hands, apply a little \ncommon sense.''\n  They notified the Army Corps of Engineers of their plans to build a \nlittle dirt berm, to redirect the channel back where it had been and \nbuild a little low-river crossing there. And, fortunately, the Army \nCorps of Engineers exercised what they call ``enforcement discretion'' \nand did not cite the county officials when that is precisely what \noccurred.\n  Now the river has been channeled back in its original place. A low-\nriver crossing has been built. And plans are going forward to \nreconstruct the bridge. An application of common sense by common \npeople, having their lives to live, who just could not afford to wait \nany longer to live in this bureaucratic morass that we have created.\n  Well, who is really at fault? It is probably ultimately the Congress' \nfault for writing a statute that permits this kind of regulatory \nauthority. But it is also the fault of the agency in not exercising the \ncommon sense to authorize the project to go forward.\n  When one considers the quality between protecting this species, which \nis somewhat questionable, as I said--and I think the folks would agree \nwith that--in any event, protecting it by letting it go back into the \nsame channel it had always been in, when you weigh that against the \nrisk of lives to people for having to cross this very narrow bridge 5 \nmiles downstream and traveling behind slow-moving farm implements and \nall the rest of it, it seems to me that it is a good example of how \nsometimes we do not apply common sense in these regulations, and it was \nnecessary for people to take matters into their own hands. \n\n[[Page S 9675]]\n\n  When it has gotten to this point, we have a problem, and that is the \nproblem we are trying to correct here with the process changes that are \nembodied in the Dole-Johnston substitute. We are not changing the \nunderlying substantive law. Endangered species, clean air, clean water, \nall of those laws that we have created for the protection and safety of \nour environment and our people still exist. They still will prevail. \nBut in the establishment of regulations now, we are asking the people \nwho implement those laws to take certain things into consideration, \nsuch as an assessment of risks and a cost-benefit analysis, when that \nis appropriate, and, in the case of certain regulations where it is \nappropriate, to do peer review. Those are all very reasonable concepts.\n  I am certain in a bipartisan way we can work out any differences that \nexist relative to the application of those principles to the \nadministering of the laws that we write.\n  Let me just conclude with a couple of other thoughts, Mr. President.\n  John Graham, professor and founding director of the Center for Risk \nAnalysis at the Harvard School of Public Health, wrote in the Wall \nStreet Journal recently:\n\n       Since zero risk is not a feasible goal, we need to rank \n     risks in order of priority.\n\n  For example, he agrees that childhood lead poisoning is a serious \npublic health problem and asserts, nevertheless, that fewer resources \nshould be used to excavate soil at Superfund sites where the \nprobability of childhood exposure to lead is low, whereas more \nresources should be directed toward cleaning up older homes in poor \ncommunities, where each day kids are ingesting house dust contaminated \nwith deteriorating lead paint. In other words, an example of where we \nprobably have our priorities wrong because of the rigidity with which \nwe developed these laws, and they are being administered pursuant to \nthat rigidity. We are trying to loosen that process up in the Congress \nby giving discretion to our agencies to apply more common sense in the \ndevelopment of a regulation.\n  The Hillary Clinton task force, as a matter of fact, used the same \ntype of prioritization and analysis. Her task force included a proposal \nfor mammograms for 50 year olds at $100 million per life saved, while \nmammograms for 40 year olds at $158 million per life saved were \nrejected as too costly.\n  The conclusion is, in both cases, obviously there are lives at stake, \nbut in one case it was simply deemed too costly for the Government to \nprovide the source of revenue for the mammograms, considering the risks \ninvolved. One can argue with that particular analysis. One can say, \n``No, that's still too great a risk.''\n  My point in citing the example is simply to note the fact that the \nPresident's wife in her task force and all of the work that she did on \nthis, a professor from Harvard, Government agencies today, all of us in \nour individual lives all use common sense and prioritize the risks \nagainst the costs. So that is not a concept that we should be arguing \nagainst. We should be implementing it in the law.\n  I cited the Harvard School of Public Health study. It indicated:\n\n       . . . reallocating resources to more cost-effective \n     programs could save an additional 60,000 lives per year \n     without increasing costs to the public or to the private \n     sector.\n\n  In other words, Mr. President, cost-benefit analyses would not only \nprevent the squandering of our scarce resources, it would actually \nenable us to maximize their impact and end up saving more lives and \npreventing more harm to our citizenry than is the case today.\n  Mr. President, there are many, many examples. I will conclude by \nsaying that it is my view that the substitute represents a good-faith \neffort to meet the concerns of those who thought that this legislation \nmight either intentionally or accidentally go too far in undermining \nexisting substantive law by assuring that it is strictly a process \nchange which supplements the authority of the people we ask to \nadminister these laws today to engage in the kind of risk assessment \nand cost benefit which all of us do every day of our lives; that that \nmakes common sense; that it will end up saving more lives; that it will \nend up saving a lot of money and, in the end, will provide a safer \nclimate for the people of our country than exists today.\n  So I certainly urge all of my colleagues at the appropriate time to \nsupport the Dole-Johnston substitute.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I say to my friend from Idaho, I will be \nbrief.\n  I think the Senator from Arizona is correct. We should not be arguing \nabout whether we should have cost-benefit analyses. The Glenn bill does \nnot argue about that. The argument is about whether or not the Dole \nbill takes too much of a risk with the public safety or not a \nsufficient risk.\n  My friend from Arizona cited some things that I think could confuse \nfolks. He indicated that the cost of regulation--and cited a study--was \nX billions of dollars per year, that that cost jobs, it cost every \nhousehold $6,000 or $16,000, I do not know what his number was, per \nyear; the implication being, if you vote for the Dole bill, those costs \nwill evaporate, those costs will go away.\n  The truth is, the Dole bill could be implemented tomorrow and the \ncost to households will actually go up, not go down. But let me just \nmake a point. We all hear, and I can cite and will cite as this debate \ngoes on, horror stories of regulations that have occurred in my State \nof Delaware, absolutely foolish, stupid things that bureaucrats do. We \nare all about here trying to rationalize this and have an element of \ncommon sense.\n  Let us talk about common sense. What is common sense for a corporate \nexecutive is not necessarily common sense for the average citizen.\n  If you are a corporate executive and you are running a steel plant in \nthe Midwest, common sense dictates that you build a great big, high \nsmokestack, like we used to see in the forties and fifties and sixties, \n350 feet high. Common sense dictates that because it is the cheapest \nthing for you to do. And then you emit out of that gigantic smokestack \ninto the upper airstream damaging particles to people's health, and you \nblow them across the country into Delaware, and you blow them into the \nState of New York and you have acid rain and you kill our fish and you \nkill our wildlife and you kill some of us. Now, that is common sense.\n  You are the chief executive officer. Someone comes along and says, \n``Now, I'll tell you what I can do for you here. We can, by you having \nto spend an additional half a billion dollars, clean your plant up. We \ncan see to it that with the Clean Air Act, we are going--it is going to \ncost you now, it is going to cost your stockholders, it may even cost \njobs, what it is going to do is cost you $400, $500 million to clean \nthe plant up.''\n  If you are the corporate executive sitting at your desk, that is not \ncommon sense to you to go and spend all that money. So what do we have \nto do to make sure that the streams in Delaware are not polluted, that \nthe Adirondacks do not have dead lakes where nothing lives because of \nacid rain? We have the Government come along and say, ``We're going to \nmake you do that, we're going to make you do it.''\n  It is common sense to the person living in Delaware that it is not a \ngood idea to have all those particles coming from the industrial \nMidwest into my State and choking us. That is common sense. It is a \ngood idea to clean the air. But that is not common sense for the \ncorporate executive. I am not suggesting they are bad or good guys, but \nlistening to my friend from Arizona, it is like if we all just sat down \nand talked about this, common sense would prevail.\n  Why did the Federal Government get in the business of air pollution \nand water pollution? Because the State of Arizona did not do it, the \nState of Delaware did not do it, the State of Kansas did not do it.\n  I was raised in a place called Claymont, DE. It sits on the border of \nPennsylvania and Delaware.\n  There are more oil refineries per square mile along the Delaware \nRiver in Marcus Hook and Chester, PA--which is less than a half mile \nfrom where I was raised--than any place in America. When I was a kid, I \nwould come out of where we lived, Brookview Apartments, my uncle would \ndrive me to school. If it was a misty fall morning, you would put on \nthe windshield wipers and literally there would be an \n\n[[Page S 9676]]\noil slick on your windshield--not figuratively, literally.\n  The State of Pennsylvania understood the prevailing wind went into \nDelaware. This was the southeast corner of Delaware, and it was a \nmultibillion-dollar industry for the State of Pennsylvania. The idea \nthat the folks in Pennsylvania were going to pass a law saying that all \nthose oil refineries in southeast Pennsylvania, which blew into New \nJersey and Delaware, had to clean up their refineries was nonexistent--\nzero. There would be a lot of political pain for those legislators in \nvoting against those captains of industry in their States, maybe \ncosting jobs at that refinery, maybe costing income to that county.\n  So the reason we got in the business in the first place is because \nindustry did not do it. They did not do it. The States did not do it. \nHow about clean water? I wonder how many people in this Chamber \nvisiting Washington would like us to get out of the business of \nassuring that their water is clean. I do not know where they live, but \nI now live along a place called the Brandywine River. A factory was \nthere, and when I was a kid, there used to be a pipe that came right \nout of the factory, a pipe that went right into the Brandywine, because \ncommon sense dictated that if you owned that factory, it made sense to \nspill that effluent into the river and wash it out into the Delaware \nRiver and into the Atlantic Ocean because it costs millions of dollars \nto put on devices to catch that dirty water.\n  Well, today, I literally--not figuratively--can raft down the \nBrandywine River, which is a tradition in our State, on inner tubes on \na Sunday with my kids. It is clean. Does anyone in this Chamber believe \nthat had we not imposed costs on industry that that river would be \nclean today? Name me a place in America where that happened without \nregulation, because common sense dictated that it is better to give the \nstockholders more money in their dividends than less.\n  I am not making a moral judgment. I am not making a statement about \ngreed or anything. It is just common sense. It made sense. It was all \nright if the Government let you put it in the river and that took it \naway. Instead of spending $12 million to treat it on-site, put it in \nthe river.\n  My friend said we all take risks, that we get in our automobiles and \nwe walk across streets. Guess why people get in their automobiles? They \nget in automobiles today because they know that the tires they buy meet \ncertain standards that the Government imposes on manufacturers. So you \ndo not have what you had in the 1940's and 1950's, tires shredding and \npeople getting killed. We now have things called inspections. In every \none of our States, in the beginning, you could drive a car when the \nmotor car came along and you did not have to go to an inspection \nstation, you did not have to show up there. You just took your risks. \nAs more cars got on the road, even States figured, hey, wait a minute, \na lot of folks are getting killed because they are putting in brakes \nthat do not work, steering mechanisms that do not function. So we have \nall these regulations. Now, they are costly. They are costly.\n  The only broad point that I wish to make now is that I hope no one \nhere--I do not think my friend from Arizona is doing so--is arguing \nthat we should not have those kinds of regulations. We are talking \nabout the margins here. What we are debating here on this floor is what \nkind of oversight, if you will, by the judiciary, and what kind of \noversight by industry, if you will, should there be to prevent the \naberrations that occur--and they do occur--and the unnecessary costs \nthat occur--and they do occur--from occurring? But if the good Lord \ncould come down and divine for us every bureaucratic glitch that occurs \nin implementing regulations --I will give you one by the way. \nUnintended consequences.\n  In my own State a friend of mine, a kid I grew up with, a very \nsuccessful highway contractor in Delaware, shows up at a function with \nme. He walks up and says, ``Joe, I am helping you again this year, but \nI could kill you.''\n  I said, ``Why?''\n  He said, ``You voted for that Americans With Disabilities Act.''\n  I said, ``Yes, but you were for that.''\n  He said, ``Yes, but I did not know you were going to do what you \ndid.''\n  I said, ``What did I do?''\n  He said, ``I will tell you what that act did.'' He owns a highway \ncontracting company, and he hires flag persons. You know, we have them \nin all our States while they are repairing the roads. One guy with a \nflag puts up a stop sign, and with a walkie-talkie he calls the person \nat the other end and says, ``You let your folks go, I will put the stop \nsign up on this end.''\n  He said, ``I hired a guy that turned out to be hard of hearing, and \nso when he was given the walkie-talkie, he picked up the walkie-talkie \nand the guy down there would say, `OK, stop them.' But he did not hear \nthem. So what would happen is cars would be coming through and they \nbanged into one another.''\n  He said, ``I moved him to another job. I put him behind a grader, and \nhe sued me under the Americans With Disabilities Act.''\n  He called over one of the most prominent lawyers in Delaware and \nsaid, ``Francis, tell him what you told me I have to do.''\n  Francis Biondi walks over and says, ``Joe, I told him he had to \nsettle this for''--I will not mention the amount--``a sizable amount of \nmoney.'' It was several times what the average American makes in a \nwhole year.\n  I said, ``How could that be?''\n  He said, ``Well, they ruled that I had to take every possible action \nto accommodate this person's disability. So do you know what they told \nme I should do? I should have had an extension that ran up 30, 40 feet \nthat had a red light and a green light on it at either end, and that \nguy would be able to look down, since his eyes were good, and he could \nsee green so that he knows to press red, and he can see red and he will \nknow to press green. His hearing would be taken out of it.''\n  I will quote my friend--I guess I will not because there was \nprofanity in it. But he basically said, ``Why in the heck do I need him \nthen, if I am going to do that?'' That is a bizarre outcome, in my \nview, for a well-intended piece of legislation.\n  But assume we took out all of those nonsensical aberrations of \nregulations that we pass. I doubt whether anybody on this floor--and \nagain, I beg the indulgence of my friend from Arizona. He gave a figure \nof several billion dollars and about $6,000 per household, I think. If \nwe got rid of every one of those stupid things, we are still at about \n$5,000 a household. So I do not want anybody on the floor--we kind of \nmix things up on the floor here. Listening to my friend from Arizona, I \nthink the average person would think that, well, if the Dole bill \npasses, a lot more people are going to be employed, and instead of my \npaying $5,000, $6,000 a year, I am not going to have to pay that \nanymore--not unless he is talking about doing away with the Clean Water \nAct and the Clean Air Act and all of these major environmental pieces \nof legislation.\n  The third point I want to make--and then I will yield the floor--is \nthat he mentioned lead paint. When I first got here in 1973, I was on \nthe Environment and Public Works Committee, which then was called the \nPublic Works Committee. I was given by the then chairman, Senator \nRandolph of West Virginia, a subcommittee assignment that had no \nlegislative authority. I had authority to hold hearings. It is called \nthe Subcommittee on Technology.\n And I could not understand why he was being so gracious to me until I \nfound out the first assignment I was given. I was given the \nassignment--being one of the Senators from Delaware, a State with a lot \nof small companies like DuPont and others residing in that State--I was \ngiven the assignment of writing a report, after holding hearings, on \nwhether or not we should phase out lead in gasoline or have lead traps \nin gasoline.\n\n  The DuPont Co. had a patent for a lead trap. If I had written a \nreport saying, ``Do not phase out lead in gasoline, do not eliminate \nlead in gasoline, just have lead traps like we had for pollution \ncontrol devices,'' I was under the impression that would be a \nmultimillion dollar, probably billion dollar, decision for the company. \nI do not recall any corporation during those hearings coming and saying \nwe should take lead out of gasoline. There was overwhelming scientific \nevidence along the lines of those my friend from Arizona cited. He \nstated that it makes more sense to clean up the lead paint, dust, \n\n[[Page S 9677]]\nand particles in existing older housing than it does to take the last \ntraces of lead out of contaminated sites in the ground where folks do \nnot live, that are now Superfund sites. I happen to agree with him.\n  But the broader point I wish to make is, were it not for a regulation \nby the Government in the first instance, there was no commonsense \nreason why corporate America thought it made sense to take lead out of \ngasoline. They all repeatedly made what we would call commonsense \narguments. First, the reason lead is put in gasoline is that you can go \nfurther on a gallon of gasoline with lead in it than without lead in \nit. Second, it is not as costly to make the gasoline. Third, you will \nemploy more people. Fourth, we have an oil embargo. It went on and on. \nThere were commonsense, legitimate reasons--but against the public \ninterest overall. Because, from the public's standpoint, common sense \nsaid, if you lived in a metropolitan area and you had a child, you \nwould have to live with lead in gasoline coming out of tailpipes of \nautomobiles or defective lead traps--which would be the case. And there \nwould have been an incredible, enormous cost of maintaining those lead \ntraps, additional costs. States would have to inspect the lead traps \nwhen you got your car inspected, and so forth. Common sense for the \ncitizen said: My kid ingests that air just like the dust particles the \nSenator from Arizona referred to.\n  So the common sense for the public--for us, as representatives of the \npublic--was to say, ``No lead in gasoline.'' The commonsense position \nfor those who made gasoline, and lead, was, ``Lead in gasoline.''\n  Again, I am not making a moral judgment. What I am saying is that, \n``What is good for the goose ain't necessarily good for the gander.'' \nWhat seems to be common sense--there is an old expression. I believe it \nis an English expression. ``What is one man's meat is another man's \npoison.'' And that is literally true, literally true in environmental \nlaw.\n  So, I hope, as we get into the detailed meat--no pun intended--of \nthis debate, we do not confuse three things. One, regardless of which \nbill prevails, the total cost--I will argue later and hopefully will be \nable to prove to my colleagues--the total cost to the American public \nin terms of dollars, the difference will be de minimis.\n  No. 2, there will be, still, a significant cost to the American \npublic for these regulations because the American public decided that \ntheir ultimate priority is the air they breathe, the water they drink, \nthe food they ingest. And the American public has had over 200 years of \nexperience, culminating at the turn of the century with Lincoln \nSteffens and others, about what happens when you do not regulate people \nwho deal with our air, affect our water, and produce our food.\n  The third and final point I will make is that when we look at the \ncost, I ask my friends to count the increased cost in the number of \nbureaucrats that would have to be hired to meet the timetables imposed \nby the Dole legislation, and the cost in additional number of judges we \nwould have to hire and the additional number of lawyers that will be \npaid, litigating every jot and tittle of the change in the Dole \nlegislation. We should count those costs, compared them to the costs \nthat come from the overstepping bureaucrat and the unreasonable \nregulation.\n  Senator Glenn and Senator Chafee have a bill that at one time was a \ntotally bipartisan bill. It passed out of the Committee on Governmental \nAffairs unanimously--without a dissenting vote; every Democrat and \nevery Republican. Then, Senator Hatch, my esteemed chairman at the \nJudiciary Committee, presented the Hatch-Dole bill. I do not know what \nwas so wrong with the bill that passed out unanimously from the \nGovernment Affairs Committee, a major piece of legislation, \nsignificantly rewriting regulatory law, significantly lifting the \nburden on American business without, in my view, doing unjust harm to \nAmerican consumers. But something happened on the way to the floor.\n  Now we have the Dole bill. Senator Dole came here today and proposed \nan E. coli amendment. Now, we argued in committee that the Dole bill, \nunless it was changed, would increase the prospect that people would \ndie from E. coli in meat in their hamburgers--feces in their food. We \nwere assured that cannot possibly happen under this law. If it was not \ngoing to be able to happen, why did Senator Dole have to come to the \nfloor and propose an amendment on that?\n  Mr. KYL. Will my friend yield on that?\n  Mr. BIDEN. I will be delighted to yield.\n  Mr. KYL. Senator Dole came to the floor to offer the amendment to \ntake away the political argument, because a red herring, as it were, \nwas being raised, an argument that somehow his bill was going to permit \npeople to get sick when, in fact, the bill would not do that at all. \nBut to get the issue off the table so people would not continue to talk \nabout it, he said, ``Fine, we will create a belt and suspenders. The \nbill already prohibits it, but we will make it crystal clear so that \nargument cannot be made anymore, so people cannot scare people.''\n  May I make one other point?\n  Mr. BIDEN. Let me respond. I will yield in a moment. Let me respond \nto that. I am glad to hear that, and that is useful. Maybe the Senator \nfrom Arizona and Senator Dole would consider, then, taking away a \ncouple of more of what they think are red herrings.\n  For example, why are we trying to undo all the Superfund site plans \nthat are soon to go into effect? Why do we not take Superfund out of \nthis legislation? It has no part in this legislation. We are told, when \nwe raise that, it is a red herring. I would like him to supply \nsuspenders on that one, too, for me. We have a belt; let us have \nsuspenders.\n  The next one I would like to consider, and then I will yield the \nfloor completely, a second one is we are told the Dole-Johnston \nlegislation does not in any way overrule existing environmental law. \nWhy do we not just say that? Why not use that exact language, just say \nit, give us the suspenders along with the belt, because some of us, \nalthough maybe we ``doth protest too loudly'' maybe we are a little too \ncynical, maybe we read things in this legislation that are truly not \nintended to be there.\n  Mr. KYL. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. LEVIN. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. BIDEN. I yield to the Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. There will be an amendment which will do precisely that, \nbecause of the concerns the Senator from Delaware and others raised. \nThese are legitimate concerns which a whole host of people who are \ndeeply involved in this issue have raised as to whether or not there is \nany--where there is a conflict, if there is one, between the provisions \nof this bill and an underlying law, what governs. We have been assured \nover and over again there is no supermandate, there is no intent to \nhave any superimposition or any undoing of existing law.\n  But the language is not clear enough. So there will be an amendment \nto add the suspenders to the belt in that area, or the belt to the \nsuspenders in that area, just as the Senator from Delaware has \nsuggested. And I hope--I do not predict--but I hope there will be \nunanimous support for that amendment when it reaches the floor.\n  Mr. BIDEN. I thank my friend. Again, I hope that occurs because, \nlook, most of us on this floor want serious regulatory reform. This is \nnot a debate about whether or not we want regulatory reform. No one can \nargue, that the original bill out of the Governmental Affairs Committee \nwas not significant regulatory reform. I am for it. I was for it then. \nI am for it now.\n  So this is not a debate about whether or not we have significant \nregulatory reform, whether or not we are going to satisfy purists, \nwhether or not we want to be bird lovers of America, to be happy with \nwhat we do. That is not my objective. My objective is to make sure that \nwe do not unintentionally or intentionally undo the one success story \nof America, the one thing I can turn to and tell my kids beyond the \nfact that black children can now go to school with white children in my \nState which was segregated by law. I can literally take them through \nthe county where I live and say, ``I could not swim there when I was \nyour age. You can now.'' I can tell them and take them in the \nneighborhood I was raised in and say, ``I can walk out in the morning \nanywhere in this development where you \n\n[[Page S 9678]]\nlive and work and breathe the air.'' They do not now have to breathe in \noil. They can turn on their windshield wipers and the windshield is \nclear.\n  I can point out to them that the Brandywine River, Christiana River, \nthe Delaware River, and people sail on it now. When we were kids, there \nwere big signs saying we could not do it. I can take them to the \nbeaches, the pristine beaches of my State and say, ``You can swim \nanywhere any time and you don't have to worry about medical waste \nrolling up here.'' I can point to them and tell them that you no longer \ntake what they took up until 12 years ago--garbage less than 1 mile out \nfrom the shores of my area--and dump it so it washes in.\n  The environmental story in America has been a success story even with \nthis aberration. I want to tell you, if my friends are as concerned, as \nI hope they are, about the environment as well as the aberration, I \nhope they will make clear these ambiguities. Maybe the Senator from \nMichigan and I are wrong about what the legislation says. But they can \nclear it up. They can clear it up very quickly for us and put to rest \nany of those steps.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Thompson). The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Mr. President, just very briefly, one of the biggest \nfights we have had about this bill--and make no mistake, it has been a \nfight--is about the question of supermandates; that is, whether this \nbill supersedes the underlying bill such as the Clean Air Act.\n  Mr. President, I laid down a marker in negotiation with Senator Dole \nand his staff, and Senator Hatch and others, that we would simply not \naccept a supermandate. The way the bill was drawn as it came from the \nHouse was that it said this section shall supersede existing law--\nsupersede. As it was reported out of the Senate Judiciary Committee, it \nsaid this bill shall supplement existing law. As we finally agreed, we \ncame up with language that says this bill shall supplement and not \nsupersede existing law.\n  Mr. BIDEN. If the Senator will yield just one second on that point, \nthe point the Senator just made I hope illustrates why the Senator from \nMichigan and I are not suspect of the Senator from Louisiana but why we \nare cynical about this because we know that the Senator from Utah and \nthe Senator from Kansas wanted to supersede it. They kept telling us \nthey did not. But we know they wanted to supersede. That is the \nproblem.\n  I think Senator Johnston has gone a long way to correcting that. But \nI just want the record to reflect, do not let anybody kid anybody. \nThese folks, my colleagues, wanted, intended, to supersede. That is the \npoint. That is why folks like me said ``bad idea.''\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, will the Senator from Louisiana yield?\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Mr. President, if I may reclaim the time for just a \nminute, it is irrelevant what the House wanted or what they wanted on \nthe initial bill. I wanted no supermandate. The point is, what does the \nlanguage say?\n  Mr. President, I have been telling my colleagues, including my dear \nfriend from Delaware, that we ought sometime to take yes for an answer. \nWhen language is clear, unambiguous, we need not put forth ambiguity \ninto it.\n  The Senator came to one of our negotiating sessions. We talked about \njudicial review. I believe I am correctly judging the Senator's \nreaction that when he read what we had about judicial review, there was \na light bulb. I think I see what he is doing now. I think you will see \nhere that not only do we have that language which says it supplements \nand does not supersede, but we also have language that explicitly \nrecognizes that there will be times when you cannot meet the test; that \nis, that the benefits justify the cost. There will be times when you \ncannot do that because the statute requires otherwise.\n  If you look on page 36, we say if applying the statutory \nrequirements--this is line 22--if, applying the statutory requirements \nupon which the rule is based, a rule cannot satisfy the criteria of \nsubsection B, it goes on to tell you what to do. But the point is that \nexplicitly recognizes that there are circumstances in which because of \nthe underlying statute, you cannot satisfy the fact that the benefits \njustify the costs because they told you in the Clean Air Act to use the \nmaximum achievable control technology, for example. That is an explicit \ntest in the Clean Air Act which may make meeting the test of subsection \nB here impossible.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Will the Senator yield for a question on that?\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Yes.\n  Mr. BIDEN. The Senator from Arizona cited--I apologize. I do not have \na copy of the statement. But I hope I state it correctly. He cited a \nsection. He referred to it as the Hillary Clinton report on \nmammography, or something to that effect, where he said that report \nincluded that women under the age of 40 for mammographies--the average \ncost was, and I forget the number--it was $150,000, or $15 million, \nwhatever it was. For women over the age of 50, it would cost less. And \nit was suggested that we should follow a cost-benefit analysis, and \ndecide that mammographies maybe should be only for women over 50 years \nof age because of the cost.\n  The way this legislation is written, if in the wisdom or the lack of \nwisdom of the U.S. Congress and with the President signing the \nlegislation, if we were to pass a piece of legislation which on its \nface made absolutely no economic sense, and we decided that even if it \ncost $10 million per life in order not to even have one life lost, you \nhad to get to zero tolerance on some chemical, clearly it would not \npass a cost-benefit analysis.\n  Let us assume the cost-benefit analysis was done and it is clear that \nthey come back and say, ``Look, this is going to cost $10 billion or $1 \nmillion or $500 million for every life you save.'' If the legislative \nbodies and the President wanted to do that, would they still be able to \ndo that?\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. I thank the Senator for his question because it is a \ncritical question. The answer is yes. It is explicit. It says we shall \nsupplement and not supersede.\n  Mr. BIDEN. May I add a followup question? This is sort of a parlance \nthat I can understand and everybody I think can understand.\n  Let us assume we pass such a bizarre law to protect the welfare of \nindividuals and it only gathered up 10, 12 people in all America who \nare affected by it. If a company, if an individual, affected by that \ncost and the onerous burden they would have to go through to meet the \nlaw, if they thought it was a bad idea, tell the Senator from Delaware \nwhat they would be able to do under this law to get to the point where \nthe section the Senator referred to takes control. What I mean by that \nis, could an individual or a company come along and say, ``OK, I demand \nthat the EPA do a cost-benefit analysis anywhere.''\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. I will tell the Senator exactly what is required. He is \ntalking about a rule already in operation.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Yes. We, the Congress, pass a law explicitly stating that \nthis end must be met and we assign it to an agency in effect, and an \nagency writes a rule.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. And DuPont wants to contest the rule, say.\n  Mr. BIDEN. All right.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Here is what would happen. Within 1 year after the \npassage of this act, the head of each of the agencies shall look at all \nthe rules under their supervision, determine which ones need to be \nlooked at, and therefore come up with a preliminary schedule. That \nschedule will be published a year afterward. If this rule is on that \nschedule, then DuPont, since they are from Delaware--that is the only \nreason I use them--would not have to take further action because it is \ngoing to be reexamined. If it is not on the schedule and they want it \nreexamined, then they would petition. Their burden is to show that \nthere is a substantial likelihood that the rule would not be able to \nreach, to satisfy the requirements of section 624.\n  Mr. BIDEN. That is the key. Let me stop the Senator there, if I may, \nMr. President. Section 624 is a different section than the section \ncited, making it clear that you do not--that cost-benefit analysis need \nnot prevail if there are other factors. You cannot supersede the \nunderlying law. The underlying law says on its face this is going to \ncost, say, an exorbitant amount.\n\n[[Page S 9679]]\n\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. If the underlying law says that, if applying the \nstatutory requirements upon which the rule is based, the underlying law \nthat requires the mammography, let us say, a rule cannot satisfy that \ncriteria of subsection (b)--subsection (b) criteria are that the rule \njustify the cost, that you have the least-cost alternative unless there \nare scientific or data uncertainties or nonquantifiable benefits----\n  Mr. BIDEN. Let me make it easy for the Senator because I think it is \nimportant the public understand this arcane notion.\n  Let us say the Congress passes a law, and the President signs it, \nthat says no matter what it costs--in the legislation----\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. I am giving the Senator an answer to that.\n  Mr. BIDEN. No matter what it costs.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Then it satisfies the requirements of section 624.\n  Mr. BIDEN. And it is ended right there?\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. And your petition would be rejected.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Will the Senator yield on that point? We have offered \nlanguage to say it that clearly in this bill, and it has been rejected. \nAnd let me just get right to the heart of the matter. We have about 10 \nCabinet officers that have issued a statement of administration policy.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Mr. President, I have the floor, and I would be glad to \nentertain the question.\n  Mr. LEVIN. The question is this. Let me just read who it is that \nsigned this before I ask the question. Secretaries of Labor, \nAgriculture, Health and Human Services, Housing and Urban Development, \nTransportation, Treasury, Interior, EPA, OMB have said that this bill \n``could be construed to constitute a supermandate that would override \nexisting statutory requirements.''\n  Now, when you have that many folks, I would think, of average or \nbetter intelligence----\n  Mr. BIDEN. I hope so.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Who say it can be interpreted that way, and when you have \na whole bunch of Senators here who say it can be interpreted that way, \nand when it is the intent now of the Senator from Louisiana and the \nSenator from Kansas and the Senator from Utah not to have it \ninterpreted that way, because that is what you have said over and over \nagain, why then not accept the language which we have offered during \nour discussion which says that in case of a conflict, in case of a \nconflict between the underlying law and this bill, the underlying law \ngoverns?\n  That is a very simple question. Why not just simply make it explicit \nthat in the event that there is a conflict between the requirements of \nthis bill and underlying law, the requirements of underlying law \ngovern? That will just eliminate all of these doubts. That is the \nsuspenders and the belt.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Mr. President, I will answer the question like this. I \ndo not care how many Cabinet people say this thing is ambiguous. It is \nnot. It is as clear as the English language can be. Now, whether they \nare ingenuous or disingenuous in their criticism, I do not know. I know \nthat this letter of administrative policy, much of it is, to be \ncharitable, disingenuous, because I sat in the room and negotiated part \nof it and accepted some of the things that came from the administration \nand then was met with the argument coming back out that that which we \naccepted was a fault in the bill.\n  Mr. LEVIN. But on this particular issue, on this particular issue----\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. On this particular issue, let me--the point is the fact \nthat they have said it does not make it so. I believe it is clear.\n  Now, what I believe also is that this language would really put an \nambiguity into it because in the event of a conflict the statute under \nwhich the rule is promulgated shall govern. Now, the statute under \nwhich the rule is promulgated did not require risk assessment, did not \nrequire cost-benefit analysis, did not require that you go through any \nof those procedural hoops. I could make the strong argument that this \nwould say that that rule under which it was promulgated, if at the time \nit was promulgated satisfied those rules, then that governs and that \nthis statute, the petition process, the look-back process, is taken out \nof the picture; it is no longer valid.\n  Does the Senator see what I am talking about?\n  Mr. LEVIN. No. I think the question I asked though is a simple one. \nWhere there is a conflict, where there is a conflict between the \nunderlying statute's criteria and the criteria in this statute, the \nquestion is what governs?\n  Now, we have been assured--I mean, we have heard many speeches on \nthis floor that there is no intent to have a supermandate, that the \nunderlying statute is going to govern. And yet when it comes right down \nto the very specific question, if there is a conflict between the \ncriteria in this statute----\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. If the Senator will let me answer, the question is, \nwhat is a conflict? If one statute requires something, a cost-benefit \nanalysis, which this does, or a risk assessment and the other statute \ndoes not, is that a conflict or is that supplementing?\n  Mr. LEVIN. The other question is, what does the word ``supplement'' \nmean? It has to have some meaning. For instance, if you could not issue \na regulation to enforce the double hulled tanker law--for instance, we \npassed a double hulled tanker law. A lot of people thought it was \nactually a bad mistake in terms of cost-benefit, but we passed it.\n  Now, the agency comes along and the agency is supposed to implement \nthat in terms of the time of implementation, and so forth. It goes \nthrough this bill. It cannot implement it. It cannot because it does \nnot pass the cost-benefit test.\n  Now, there is an argument--there is an argument which has been raised \nthat the Senator from Louisiana, I would hope, would want to address.\n  He recognized very forthrightly to the Senator from Delaware what \nhappens when you go through all the cost-benefit analysis, the risk \nassessment. It does not make any sense to have a double hulled tanker \nrule, but that is the law. The Senator from Louisiana says the law \ngoverns. The double hulled tanker law governs, period. Then it seems to \nme that the concerns which have been raised by so many Members here and \nso many of the administration that we ought to say it clearly should be \naddressed. We ought to say it clearly.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. If the Senator will yield, the problem is your \nsuggested language does not say it clearly. I believe it says it \nclearly when you say it shall supplement and not overrule. And then, \nwhen you have this alternative requirements language which explicitly \nrecognizes that there will be times when you cannot meet the criteria \nof the benefits justifying the cost because the statute requires it, if \nin applying the statutory requirement, you cannot meet the criteria, \nthen it tells you what to do. You can go ahead and promulgate the rule. \nThat is precisely what it means.\n  Now, if you come up with some other language that does not itself \nmake an ambiguity where there is not now, I mean, I would be glad to \nclarify. If you supplement and not override--I believe when you say \n``supplement,'' that means you are supposed to read the two in harmony, \nbut you are not overriding the substantive requirements of the \nunderlying law. It is very tricky to start talking about what is the \nunderlying law and what is procedure, what is substance; what is \nsupplement, what is override. I believe we have hit the appropriate \nbalance, particularly in light of the alternative requirements language \nof page 36.\n  Mr. LEVIN. If the Senator from Louisiana again would yield, the \nlanguage which the Senator points to as being the clarifying language \nfor the issue that we are discussing does not address a critical issue. \nIn fact, I think it makes it more ambiguous. We have talked about this \nat some length off the floor, and perhaps to some extent we covered it \nthis morning. But what the Senator says is, if, applying statutory \nrequirements upon which the rule is based, a rule cannot satisfy \ncriterion in subsection (b), then you go to (c).\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Yes.\n  Mr. LEVIN. When you go to (c), which is what the Senator says we \nshould do, what (c) says is that in certain circumstances underlying \nlaws are going to govern. And here is what he says. Here is what the \nbill says. ``If scientific, technical or economic uncertainties are \nnonquantifiable benefits to health, safety and the environment,'' \n\n[[Page S 9680]]\nthen certain things follow from that. And so the question which many of \nus have asked is, what happens if the benefits are quantifiable?\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. First of all----\n  Mr. LEVIN. I am not talking about lives. I understand that the \nSenator from Louisiana believes that the value of a life is not \nquantifiable. That perhaps is common parlance here. I know it is used \ndifferently from the agencies. That is not the question I asked.\n  What happens, for instance, if a law says that you have to reduce the \nparts per trillion of a certain toxic substance to at least 10? That is \nwhat the law says. Beyond that, an agency will do a cost-benefit \nanalysis. If the agency, after doing that cost-benefit analysis, \nreaches the conclusion that it makes good sense to go to, let us say, 6 \nparts per trillion, now, that is quantifiable. That is very \nquantifiable. They have gone from cost per parts per trillion in \ndollars. We are not now talking about lives or asthma or other kinds of \nproblems. We are talking about parts per trillion. Under this language, \nsince it is quantifiable, there is no escape from (b).\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. There is, if the Senator will follow this through with \nme. See, the agency has a lot of discretion. Now, the agency discretion \nin the first instance is to interpret the statute. What does the \nstatute mean? There will be a level of discretion between a minimal \nlist interpretation and a maximum interpretation where the agency can \npick that interpretation and is not overruled unless their judgment is \narbitrary and capricious or an abuse of discretion. So, in the first \ninstance, they can pick that interpretation; that is to say, they can \npick that level of cost. Now they must meet the test of the benefits \njustifying the cost. But when you meet the test of the benefits \njustifying the cost, you use the definition of benefits as found on \npage--I think it is 621, subsection (5)--which says that benefits \ninclude both quantifiable and nonquantifiable benefits to health, \nsafety and the environment. So that, if it is quantifiable, then you \npick it up in the first instance of benefits justifying the cost. But \nwe wanted to be sure that sometimes there will be some lagniappe, some \nnonquantifiable benefits to health, safety and the environment. I \nbelieve that clean air is not quantifiable as a benefit. I believe that \nthe benefits of health are non-quantifiable. \nNotwithstanding, my friend from Michigan thinks a life, you can put a \ndollar value on it.\n  Mr. LEVIN. No. I am saying that the agencies do--because a risk \nassessment--you have to make those kinds of assessments.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. If they can pick it up as a quantifiable matter under \nthe definition on 621(5)--no--621(2) and (3).\n  Mr. LEVIN. If the Senator from Louisiana will yield for 1 more \nminute. The question is, if you cannot meet the requirements of (b), if \nyou cannot meet them, then you go to (c). Under (c) the Senator does \nnot provide for quantifiable and nonquantifiable benefits, but only for \nnonquantifiable. You have not done in (c) what you did in your \ndefinition of benefits. And there is no reason not to do it, by the \nway. There is no reason.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Let me tell you why. When you go to (c), then you \ncannot satisfy your benefits justifying the cost. But the statute \nrequired you to do something. And so you are required to go ahead and \ndo what the statute says, notwithstanding that the benefits did not \njustify the cost. Keep in mind that those benefits included all of your \nquantifiable as well as nonquantifiable benefits.\n  Mr. KERRY. Would my colleague yield for a question?\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Not yet.\n  And you can go ahead and do what the statute tells you. Moreover, you \ncan do more than the least cost of what the statute tells you. You can \ngo beyond that if there are uncertainties of science, uncertainties of \ndata or nonquantifiable benefits to health, safety or the environment. \nSo this is over and above to that which the statute required. And the \nstatute required you to do something that was not cost-benefit \njustified.\n  Mr. LEVIN. On that issue, to pursue it, can you move to a more costly \nprogram if the benefits are quantifiable?\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Is it beyond what the statute required?\n  Mr. LEVIN. No. Using my example, the statute says you have got to get \nto at least 10 parts per trillion reduction. That is the toxic \nsubstance. We want as a minimum to get to 10 parts per trillion.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Yes.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Now, the agency does a cost-benefit analysis and it finds \nthat for a few dollars extra it can get to 6. After 6 parts per \ntrillion, it becomes so costly it probably is not worth it.\n  My question is, this is highly quantifiable. We know exactly how many \ndollars for each part per trillion. But under the language of this \nbill, you could not get to 6 parts per trillion because 10 parts is \nslightly cheaper than 6 and it meets the test of the statute that the \nagency get at least to 10.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Let me answer the Senator's question. I think the \nsimple answer is, yes, you can, but there is a caveat. If it is within \nthe discretion of the agency head and the interpretation of the statute \nto have some leeway as to the interpretation, then yes, you can.\n  Mr. LEVIN. How would that be least costly?\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Wait a minute. The statute is clear under the Chevron \ncase, the Supreme Court case. What it said is that if the Congress has \nspoken on an issue and congressional intent is clear, then that \ncongressional intent must be enforced. So that if, for example, you \nrequired that you meet 40 miles per gallon as a cafe standard, then I \ndo not believe that the administrator could come in and say, well, \nlook, it would be nice to go to 50 or 55 because we like that more. If \nCongress has spoken and the intent is clear, then you must follow \ncongressional intent. If----\n  Mr. LEVIN. If the Senator would use my hypothetical where you must \nget to at least 10 parts per trillion reduction.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. If the phraseology of the statute is ``at least,'' then \nthat in turn would give discretion to the agency head.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Under the provision of this bill, you must use the least \ncostly alternative to get to the goals set by Congress. The least \ncostly alternative is to get to 10. Under my hypothetical, for a very \nslight additional cost, you can get to 6. After 6 the cost goes off the \nchart.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. As I say, the simple answer is yes, unless \ncongressional intent prohibits that by having spoken on it, and the \nSenator's hypothetical example would indicate by the use of the words \n``at least'' that it is within a permissible interpretation.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Under this bill, it is not the least cost.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. The answer is that they could, because those parts per \nmillion would relate to a benefit to health or the environment and, \ntherefore, would be a nonquantifiable benefit to health or the \nenvironment.\n  Mr. LEVIN. If I could, again, ask the Senator to yield for a \nquestion. It is very quantifiable. There is no way under which my \nhypothetical can reasonably be described as setting forth a \nnonquantifiable.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. What is quantifiable with the Senator is parts per \nmillion.\n  Mr. LEVIN. That is exactly what is in the statute. It does not talk \nabout lives and it does not talk about breathing. What the statute says \nin my hypothetical is you must get to at least 10 parts per trillion of \na toxic substance. Beyond that, the agency is allowed to use some \ndiscretion using cost-benefit analysis and risk analysis.\n  Under my hypothetical, you get to six in a very cost-effective way, \nbut under the Senator's bill, because it says you must use the least-\ncost method to get to an alternative, which is in the statute, since 10 \nis an alternative permitted by statute, your least cost drives you to \n10, whereas cost-benefit drives you to six.\n  There is a conflict between the cost-benefit and the least cost and I \nthink--by the way, Senator Roth is someone who is on the floor who \nknows a great deal about this subject and I think has some similar \nconcerns with this.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. The Senator has asked a question, and the answer to his \nquestion is, if it is parts per million of a toxic substance, therefore \nit relates to benefits to health or to the environment and, therefore, \nis specifically covered under the phrase that says where \nnonquantifiable benefits to health, safety or the environment makes a \nmore expensive alternative appropriate \n\n[[Page S 9681]]\nor in the public interest, then you may pick the more costly \nalternative.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Since there is an ambiguity here at a minimum, I think a \nfair reading would be since the word is ``nonquantifiable'' and my \nhypothetical is very quantifiable, at least reasonably interpreted, \nalthough the Senator from Louisiana does not agree with the \ninterpretation, surely I gave a very quantifiable hypothetical.\n  My question is, why not eliminate that ambiguity by stating that if \nthere is either a quantifiable or a nonquantifiable benefit which is \ncost-effective and permitted by statute that the administrator will be \nallowed to go to the most cost-effective rather than the least-cost \nconclusion? That is the question. Why not eliminate the ambiguity?\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. The answer is we took care of whatever ambiguity there \nwas at the behest of the Senator from Michigan. You will recall our \nnegotiation on this, and we added quantifiable and nonquantifiable to \nthe definition of benefit in section 621.\n  Mr. LEVIN. That was not at my behest. That was before I raised this \nissue which I raised with you.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. No, this was done between the time we filed the first \nDole-Johnston amendment----\n  Mr. LEVIN. Not at the behest of the Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Well, the issue was at least talked about by the \nSenator from Michigan. I do not know that the Senator from Michigan \nsuggested this exact fix. He was at least in the room. I thought it was \nhe who raised this question of quantifiable and nonquantifiable.\n  Whoever raised it, we changed that definition so that benefit means \nidentifiable significant favorable effects, quantifiable and \nnonquantifiable, so that you are able to use it, whether it is \nquantifiable or nonquantifiable, in meeting that test of cost-benefit. \nThis is when you go beyond the quantifiable. You already quantified \nyour benefits, but there will be other benefits nonquantifiable--the \nvalue of a life, the value of clean air, the smell of flowers in the \nspringtime--all unquantifiable. That is what you can take into \nconsideration, and we explicitly recognize that. You have already taken \ninto consideration quantifiable, as well as nonquantifiable wants, but \nwe are going beyond the statute at this point.\n  Does the Senator have a question?\n  Mr. KERRY. I appreciate the Senator being willing to take some time. \nI would like to follow up on the questioning of the Senator from \nMichigan, because I believe that he has targeted one of the most \nserious conflicts, ambiguities--whatever you want to label it at this \npoint in time--and clearly in the legislative process, we ought to \nstrive, where we identify that kind of ambiguity, to avoid it. I am \nsure the Senator would agree.\n  As I read the relevant sections, I confront the same quandary the \nSenator from Michigan does, and I find that in the answers of the \nSenator from Louisiana there is, in effect--not consciously \nnecessarily, but because of the difference of interpretation or \ndefinition, there is an unavoidable sliding away from the meat or the \ncenter of the hypothetical posed.\n  The hypothetical that was posed by the Senator from Michigan is \nreally more than a hypothetical. It is an everyday occurrence in the \nreality of agency rulemaking. I think the Senator from Louisiana knows \nthat almost all the agencies quantify almost every benefit.\n  So let me ask a first threshold question. Does the Senator from \nLouisiana accept that some benefits are quantifiable?\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Of course.\n  Mr. KERRY. If some benefits are quantifiable, does the Senator accept \nthat a certain health benefit could be quantifiable?\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. It depends on what kind of health and certain aspects--\n--\n  Mr. KERRY. Let me ask the Senator this. Does the Senator believe that \nit is possible to quantify the number of hospitalization cases for \nemphysema or lung complications that might follow from reducing air \nquality to a certain level of parts per million?\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. You can certainly quantify statistically those things. \nYou cannot quantify the value and the value of the benefit.\n  Mr. KERRY. Well, I question that. That is an interesting distinction \nbecause----\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. If so, you can take into consideration for the purpose \nof your benefits justifying your costs.\n  Mr. KERRY. As the Senator knows, in the newspapers in the last \nmonths, we have seen repeated stories of the rise of asthma and allergy \nreactions in children in the United States. We have a quantifiable \nnumber of asthma prescriptions that are issued as a consequence of this \nrise of asthmatic condition. That is quantifiable in cost. We have a \nrising number of visits to doctors for diagnosis, and that is \nquantifiable in cost by the reporting levels that have allowed the \nnewspapers to report a percentage of increase in America.\n  To follow up on the so-called hypothetical of the Senator from \nMichigan, those costs are quantifiable. We know, in many cases, how \nmuch it costs America in money spent on health care, in money spent on \nhospitalization, in lost time at work in a series of quantifiable \neffects. We know that, and that can be measured against the cost of \nreducing whatever is the instigator of those particular effects.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Right.\n  Mr. KERRY. The Senator agrees.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Yes, but you see, all of those costs, whether \nquantifiable or nonquantifiable in the first instance, to determine \nwhether the benefits justify the cost, were taken into consideration. \nSo I ask under your hypothetical, are you telling me that the \nquantifiable and nonquantifiable benefits would not justify the cost, \nwhatever the statute said?\n  Mr. KERRY. I think to answer your question and to sort of continue \nthe colloquy, if we can, the answer is that there is an uncertainty as \nto that, because what is contained in the definitional portion of the \nstatute is never a sufficient clarification for what is contained in a \nparticular section where the substance is interpreted by the court. The \ncourt may find that the definition intended one thing, but in the \nsubstance of the section, the court will find there is a conflict with \nthe definition, and they are going to go with the substance.\n  So what the Senator from Michigan is saying and what I think a number \nof us are saying is, let us not allow for that ambiguity. In our \nlegislative role, we have identified this ambiguity, we are troubled by \nthe potential impact of this ambiguity, and we are suggesting a remedy \nthat is precisely in keeping with the stated intent of the Senator from \nLouisiana.\n  So the question comes back that I know the Senator from Michigan has \nasked previously: Why would we not therefore legislate to a greater \ncapacity of perfection the intent that the Senator says is contained in \nthe language? It does no other change to the bill.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. I do not know whether the Senator understands what I am \nsaying. Did the benefits justify the cost of your--what was it--did \nthey or did they not?\n  Mr. KERRY. No.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. You see, his hypothetical was that if you add a little \nbit of extra cost, you get a big benefit.\n  Mr. KERRY. It is not a hypothetical.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. If that is so, the benefit justified the cost.\n  Mr. KERRY. If we have a statute--the underlying statute suggests \nthat, for reasons of the health of our citizens, we want to achieve a \nminimum reduction in emission standards to 10 parts per million--a \nminimum standard. But the legislation empowers the agency to go \nfurther. It is a minimum standard.\n  Now, under your language, a measurement would be made as to the \nbenefit of the minimum standard, but it would also----\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. A measure would be made as to the rule, the rule as \ninterpreted by the agency. That is what is subjected to the benefit-\ncost ratio.\n  Mr. KERRY. I agree. And the judgment made by the agency would be, \ndoes this rule or some--at the moment, we make the standard according \nto health-based and technology-based criteria. And we make an \nevaluation as to what are the benefits of reducing the air quality. We \nmake an analysis of what is the benefit of breaking it down to the 10 \nparts per million. Let us say that for 10 parts per million reduction, \nthe cost-benefit analysis shows an expenditure of $100 and it saves 100 \nlives. \n\n[[Page S 9682]]\nBut the same analysis has shown that for an expenditure of $105, you \ncould save 150 lives.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Yes, well, did----\n  Mr. KERRY. Let me just finish. Under your language of least-cost \nalternative, and the distinction between quantifiable and \nnonquantifiable, the agency would be restricted to the $100 expenditure \nand 100 lives, even though $105 could save you 150 lives.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Not true, Mr. President, I tell my colleague, because \nthere is nothing here--first of all, I do not know of any statute that \nsays a minimum of so many parts per million with discretion to go \nhigher.\n  Mr. KERRY. There is a statute. The Clean Air Act has minimal \nstandards.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. It is maximum achievable controlled technology, which \nis not stated in parts per million. There are other standards. For \nexample, there are radiation standards that do specify so many rems or \nmillirems per year, et cetera. The Clean Air Act is maximum achievable \ncontrolled technology. That gives to the administrator a broad \ndiscretion as to what is maximum and what is achievable; that is to \nsay, what is on the shelf.\n  Mr. KERRY. But the underlying statute--if I can say to the Senator, I \nhave the examples. I did not come to the floor with them at this moment \nbecause I came from another meeting. But this particular colloquy was \ntaking place. I can assure the Senator that I will provide him with \nspecific statutory examples where this so-called hypothetical clash \nexists. All I am suggesting----\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. I would like to see that because we have talked about \nthese hypothetical clashes. You see, in your hypothetical, the benefits \njustified the cost, because in the first instance you saved lives----\n  Mr. KERRY. I agree that the benefits do, but----\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. And if it is within the realm of discretion of the \nadministrator----\n  Mr. KERRY. But there is no discretion.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Under the law of the Supreme Court, in the Chevron \ncase, the last and most definitive case I know of on the issue, they \nsay specifically if the Congress has specifically spoken to an issue \nand the intent is clear, then the agency must follow the intent of \nCongress--``Must'' follow.\n  Mr. KERRY. But the----\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. I do not think you disagree with that.\n  Mr. KERRY. The problem I think we are underscoring here--and I cannot \nfor the life of me understand the restraint on a simple clarification \nwhich actually codifies the stated intent of the Senator in this \ncolloquy. I mean, this is very simple language. It seeks to say if \nthere is a conflict between the cost-benefit analysis in the underlying \nstatute and the least-cost standards, the underlying statute prevails. \nThat is supposedly the stated intent of the Senator.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. That is absolutely the intent.\n  Mr. KERRY. Why can the simple language not say, in the event of a \nconflict, the underlying statute prevails?\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. I would have no problem with proper language to do \nthat. The problem is that, first of all, I think we have very clear \nlanguage right now. I think it is very clear. The offered language \ncreates its own ambiguity.\n  Mr. KERRY. I agree. I think the offered language--I do not disagree, \nif he is referring to the language proffered earlier by the Senator \nfrom Ohio.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. It says, ``In the event of a conflict, the statute \nunder which the rule is promulgated shall govern.''\n  Mr. KERRY. I could walk the Senator through now literally section by \nsection, and I think that when you do that, the ambiguity sort of leaps \nout at you. And when you have to go from one section to the other and \nthen ultimately find in the remote definition section one word--\n``social''--that somehow embraces this concept that you will have this \nrelevant benefit analysis, I think we are asking lawyers to start to \ntie up the regulatory process. The whole purpose of a lot of our \nefforts here in the Congress now is to reduce the need for anyone to \nhave to litigate what we are trying to legislate.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. I tell my friend that it is indeed a complicated \nstatute. But I think it is clear, and the problem is that--you talk \nabout will ``social'' embrace all these things. We say ``benefit'' \nmeans the reasonably identifiable--this is page 13, section 621(2), \nline 8: The term benefit means ``reasonably identifiable, significant \nfavorable effects.''\n  Mr. KERRY. Are we reading from the----\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. We are reading actually from the substitute. In any \nevent, it says, ``reasonably identifiable, significant favorable \neffects, quantifiable and nonquantifiable, including social and \nenvironmental health and economic effects.''\n  We did not want to go into a laundry list because my friend knows the \nold rule about specifying one thing excludes those matters not \nspecified. You will remember the old rule from law school. That is the \nproblem here. But it is, I think, really clear.\n  To get back to your question of the underlying statute governing, I \ninsist that it is absolutely clear. Nevertheless, I would recommend to \nmy colleagues a clarification, if the clarification does not inject its \nown ambiguity.\n  Mr. LEVIN. If the Senator will yield, I am delighted to hear that \nbecause in the eyes of many, and I think many who work with the \nSenator, who the Senator knows and are reasonable in their reading of \nlaws, there is ambiguity in this language. There has been an important \nand intensive effort to remove the ambiguity to make it clear that \nthere is no supermandate that underlying law governs. That is the issue \nhere. That is stated to be the intent of the Senator from Louisiana, \nand the language which can make sure that intent is carried forward in \nthis statute is, I believe, quite easily drawn. We will be offering \nthat language later on this afternoon, and I hope the Senator from \nLouisiana can join in that clarification.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. I certainly will. Does the Senator understand my \nproblem with the phrase, ``in the event of conflict, the statute under \nwhich the rule is promulgated shall govern''?\n  Mr. KERRY. The Senator is saying that he believes that it is opening \nup a whole rule interpretation, is that correct?\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. What I am saying is we do not define what--conflict. \nWhat we really mean is the substantive requirements of a health-based \nstandard or a technology-based standard; that those health-based or \ntechnology-based standards shall govern. And we do not mean that the \nprocedures under which the rule was adopted shall govern.\n  If you can get an appropriate way to phrase that concept, I certainly \nwould recommend it. Even though I think it is clear, we want to \nreassure where we can.\n  Mr. KERRY. In furtherance of that reassurance, could I just ask the \nSenator, is it the clear intent of the Senator to invoke into the \nrulemaking process a practicable, efficient, cost analysis?\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Of course. Of course.\n  Mr. KERRY. I would say to the Senator that I accept that. The Senator \nfrom Michigan accepts that. And that is what we want to achieve.\n  In the doing of that, I assume the Senator would want to also \nguarantee that cost analysis does not become a supermandate?\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Oh, of course.\n  Mr. KERRY. Therefore we should, I think, be able to arrive at \nlanguage--driven at by the Senator from Michigan--that achieves an \navoidance of the ambiguity, but without creating a new potential for \ndisruption of that cost analysis.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. May I suggest here a way, perhaps, to get at this \nquestion of conflict? Part of my problem is to say that ``in the event \nof conflict''--in my judgment there is no possibility of conflict. We \nhave written conflict out. So, therefore, you do not want to admit the \npossibility of that which you have written out, which injects its own \nambiguity. So you ought to take that phrase out and simply say that \nnothing herein shall derogate or diminish or repeal or modify the \nhealth-based standards or the technology-based standards of \nenvironmental statutes--or words to that effect.\n  Mr. LEVIN. We are drafting language to address an ambiguity that we \nperceive to be in the bill. And we will try to write it in such a way--\nwe will write \n\n[[Page S 9683]]\nit in such a way that it does not create any other ambiguity.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. If you would just leave out that ``in the event of \nconflict,'' because there is no conflict. That is why we say it shall \nsupplement and not supersede, because we have written it in such a way \nthat it does not conflict and we do not want courts to find conflict \nwhere none is there.\n  Mr. KERRY. Suppose we say in the event of unforeseen consequences, \nincapable of being described by the sagacity of the drafter of the \nbill, we nevertheless----\n  Mr. LEVIN. In the event somebody finds it.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. We do not admit of that possibility.\n  Mr. President, I think this has been a very useful exchange. And I \nhope, maybe following up on this, we can make clear that those health-\nbased standards and technology-based standards of the environmental \nstatutes are not affected, repealed, or modified in other ways.\n  Mr. LEVIN. And other statutes also, which are important to health and \nsafety; the underlying statutes.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. What we are talking about is health-based or \ntechnology-based standards. Is there any other standard we are talking \nabout?\n  Mr. LEVIN. Could be just a standard that the Congress sets.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Yes, I----\n  Mr. LEVIN. Could be the double-hulled tanker. I am not sure what that \nis based on. We made a decision on that and you do not intend that \nanything in this bill is intended to supersede it. The problem is, \nbecause of the ambiguity we pointed out, it could be interpreted that \nthere is an ambiguity in that kind of situation.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. The point is let us make it relate to standards and not \nto procedures.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Right.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Because the procedures surely do supplement and they do \nnot conflict.\n  Mr. LEVIN. It is our intent that our language address the ambiguity \nthat we and many others perceive in the bill without creating any other \nambiguity. We will show it to the Senator before we offer it.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. I thank the Senator. I think we made progress.\n  Mr. KERRY. I think the Senator is correct.\n  Mr. CHAFEE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I wonder if those Senators have completed \ntheir discussion? I would like to proceed for a few minutes.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Did the Senator wish to ask a question?\n  Mr. CHAFEE. No. I wanted to proceed. I did not want to intervene with \nsomething if they were just about concluding.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. No, Mr. President. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, the regulatory reform bill now pending \nbefore the Senate would, if enacted, bring sweeping changes to the \nregulations that protect the health and safety of the American people \nand of our natural environment.\n  What am I talking about? Let us take a look at this cost-benefit \nanalysis business. Perhaps the most important feature of this bill is \nthe new role for cost-benefit analysis in evaluating health, safety and \nenvironmental rules. Under S. 343, which is the bill before us, the \nDole-Johnston bill, every major rule issued by a Federal agency must be \naccompanied by a study setting forth the costs that will be imposed by \nthe rule and the benefits that will be experienced when the rule is \nfully implemented.\n  In other words, you figure the costs on one side and figure the \nbenefits on the other.\n  This is not exactly a new development. That has been required by \nExecutive order since the beginning of President Reagan's \nadministration.\n  There are, however, two new twists to this, in this legislation. \nFirst, there is a prohibition on the issuance of any rule, unless the \nFederal agency can certify that the benefits of the rule justify the \ncosts. And, second, the opportunity exists for extensive court review \nof the scientific and economic studies that form the basis for the \nagency's certification.\n  In other words, there are two new features in this bill. We have had \ncost-benefit analysis in the past. But this requires it. In other \nwords, there can be no issuance of any rule unless the agency, the \nFederal agency, can certify that the benefits justify the costs. \nSecond, we have in this legislation this extensive judicial review.\n  The cost-benefit analysis becomes a gate through which all of our \nhealth and environmental policies must pass. And the gate will be \nguarded by a host of litigants in Federal courts all across our land. \nThey will spend millions of dollars on legal challenges to prevent new \nrules from becoming effective.\n  This is a big departure from the existing situation that we now have \nin our country. Although cost-benefit analysis is now a useful tool in \nwriting regulations, it is important to remember that most health and \nenvironmental policies are not based on a strict cost-benefit calculus. \nOther values are also important in setting national goals. In some \nlaws, the instruction to the agency is to protect public health and to \nset a standard that ensures that no adverse health effect will result \nfrom pollution. Some of our laws are based on the principle of \nconservation. Agencies are directed to take whatever action is \nnecessary to save a species, an endangered species, for example, or to \nsave a wild area from development or exploitation.\n  In many cases our laws require the use of best available pollution \ncontrol technology. This is sometimes referred to as BAT, best \navailable technology. Our science and engineering is too limited to \nknow how to achieve an absolutely safe level, so we say to those \nengaged in activities that may cause pollution, ``Do the best you can \nto limit the impact on others, or on nature.''\n  But that is not the theory of this bill. The purpose of this bill \nbrings an end to that philosophy of ``do the best you can.'' The report \nof the Judiciary Committee says it very well. The Judiciary Committee \nsays, ``The proper philosophy for environmental law is summed up in \nthis question: Is it worth it in dollars and cents?'' That is on page \n71 of the Judiciary Committee report. ``Is this action worth it in \ndollars and cents.''\n  That is a new philosophy. No longer is the question asked, ``What is \nsafe? What is the best we can do to preserve our natural heritage?'' \nThose may have been the principles that formed our environmental \npolicies over the last quarter of a century, ever since 1972, but now \nwe are being told that policy is too expensive. We should pay only as \nmuch as we are going to get back. Is it worth it in dollars and cents?\n  That is the new philosophy that is in this bill. This, it seems to \nme, this cost-benefit approach--everything in dollars and cents--ought \nto appeal to the man described by Oscar Wilde in the last century. \nOscar Wilde described somebody as being the following: He knows the \nprice of everything and the value of nothing.\n  Is it worth it? It may seem like a commonsense test that should apply \nto all regulations. But it falls well short of the envision that has \nbeen the foundation of our environmental laws for the past quarter of a \ncentury. Much of our current environmental law is based on the common \nlaw concept of nuisance. Simply stated it is this: People have a right \nto be free from injury caused by the activities of another. Under \ncommon law, going back to the 16th century, each property owner has the \nprivate right of action to abate or to receive compensation for a \nnuisance imposed by a neighbor. This is a property right. One type of \nnuisance frequently addressed in common law courts was the matter of \nfoul odors created by some activity such as keeping livestock or \noperating a slaughterhouse. In fact, the first nuisance case involved \nodors caused by pigs kept in the alleys of London. The common law \ncourts took action to prevent these nuisances such as noxious odors \nbecause one person has no right to act in ways that infringe on the \nproperty rights of another. Under the common law, public officials \ncould also bring action to prevent a nuisance that affected the whole \ncommunity.\n  As our society became more industrialized, more complex, the \npotential injuries caused by pollution became more far reaching and \nsubtle. The ability of common law to abate and redress injuries \neffectively was undermined. \n\n[[Page S 9684]]\n\n  So it was not the old question of your neighbor suddenly bringing a \nwhole lot of pigs on his property, and you are downwind causing your \nproperty to become of less value because of the noxious odors. That is \nthe simple case. But it became much more complex as society became more \ncomplex.\n  General pollution control regulations, imposed first by the States \nand then by the Federal Government, have been established as the more \nefficient alternative, and have largely superseded the role of common \nlaw remedies in protecting our rights to be free from pollution. For \nexample, the concern for air pollution that started under common law as \na complaint against these noxious odors I just described have been \ntransformed into a concern for the serious health affects that may be \ncaused by air pollution. Today, we have the Clean Air Act that sets \nFederal standards for smog and carbon monoxide and lead. The foundation \nof these laws is, in part, the belief that we have a right to live free \nfrom threats to human health caused by the actions of others. The \nunderlying principle has been retained. One person engaging in private \nactivities does not have the right to impose injuries on another or the \ncommunity at large. That principle is the source of many standards that \ninstruct agencies to reduce pollution to levels that are safe or at \nwhich no adverse public health effects will occur.\n  The right to be free from pollution is compromised by this bill, S. \n343. This bill imposes a cost-benefit test on regulations to control \npollution. The theory behind the cost-benefit analysis is your neighbor \nhas a right to pollute as long as the damage to you is less costly than \nthe cost of pollution control devices are to the neighbor. In other \nwords, if you are damaged less than the cost you can impose on him to \nstop this pollution, he does not have to install the pollution control. \nYes. You suffer. But that is tough luck.\n  Let us suppose a large manufacturing firm locates a new plant in the \ncommunity. The company's owner admits that the plant will release \npollution into the air and water of the community. They also admit \nthat, depending on the level of pollution control required, the \npollution may cause illness or even death among the neighboring \nresidents. How much pollution control should the plant be required to \ninstall? One way to answer that question is to set limits on the \npollution so that there will be no adverse effects on the health or on \nthe community as a whole. Another answer is that the plant should be \nrequired to use the best available technology to control the pollution. \nWe may not know precisely what is safe or at what levels or by what \nroutes people will be exposed to the solution. So we ask the owners of \nthe plant. We do not ask them. We tell them. That is the way it works \nnow--to make the investment in the best pollution control equipment \nthey can afford, to do the best we can. That is how the law works now. \nBut that is not how this new law works as proposed.\n  Under the cost-benefit approach there would be a limit on how much we \ncould ask that plant to do to clean up its pollution. The limit would \nbe determined by putting a price tag on the adverse effects of the \npollution. How many people get sick? What is the cost for their medical \ncare? How many days are they off from work or home from school because \nof illness? What is it worth to be able to fish in a stream that flows \nnear the plant and to enjoy outdoor exercise in that town on a clear \nsummer day free from smog and pollution? Under the cost-benefit \napproach, pollution control is only required if it costs less than the \nmedical care for those stricken.\n  If the medical care is higher and you are doing more damage and \ncausing more sickness than the cost of the equipment, then you have to \nput the equipment on. But if the equipment cost is higher than the cost \nof the sickness, you do not have to put it on.\n  A stream is not cleaned up unless the recreational business or \ncommercial fisheries that use the stream are worth more than the \ninvestment in the pollution control equipment. Some people may get \nsick. Some people miss work or school. A fisherman may lose his job. A \nboat house may close down. But that is all OK under this bill because \nthe alternative--asking the factory to do its best to reduce the \npollution--would cost too much, would cost more than the losses \nsuffered by the neighbors.\n  To me this is an outrage. I mean have you ever heard anything like \nthis? It is all right to cause pollution. You do not have to stop it as \nlong as the cost of the equipment to stop it would be greater than the \ncost of the sickness you are causing to your neighbors and those \ndownwind and the others in the area. This is a very different ethic \nthan that which guides our current policies. It abandons the principles \nof safety and conservation and doing the best we can. It abandons the \nnotion of the right to be free from pollution that is the basis of our \ncurrent laws.\n  All of this is coming from a Senate that is saying we protect private \nproperty. We want people to be paid when there are takings. Indeed, \nthis is a bill that comes over from the House that says if the cost of \nendangered species and having that and protecting the endangered \nspecies is more than 30 percent of your land, you have to be \ncompensated because that is a taking. But it is all right to take \nsomebody's health. You do not bother with that. Somehow everything has \ngone crazy around this place.\n  This bill would allow your neighbor to take your property rights \nunless the Government can prove that the adverse effects you suffer are \nworth more than the cost that would be imposed for the pollution \nequipment.\n  I want to make it clear that it is not the information provided by \nthe cost-benefit analysis that concerns me. I think that all regulatory \noptions should be rigorously analyzed and the options selected should \nput a premium on efficiency and flexibility and good science. We want \nall of these things.\n  The cost benefit studies that have been done under the Executive \norders as exist now under President Reagan and others have provided a \nuseful tool, a tool to improve the quality of the regulations. I have \nsponsored, along with Senator Glenn, a bill that would require cost-\nbenefit analyses and risk assessment for all major rules. The \ninformation generated by these studies is quite helpful to the \nagencies.\n  It is quite another matter to say that any polluter can go to court \nand challenge a rule because it imposes more costs on his activities \nthan the benefits that are realized by the neighbors. Under this bill, \nS. 343, you say you cannot make me put that pollution control equipment \non because, yes, I am causing bad health downstream to my neighbors, \nbut that is all right because the cost of their missing school or \nmissing work or the old people suffering from asthma, we put a price on \nthat, and the price of that is less than the cost of my equipment that \nI have to put on so I do not have to put it on.\n  That is the new philosophy that is in this legislation.\n  Mr. President, here is the second general point. I am concerned about \nthe explosion in litigation that will result if this bill is enacted. \nAll of us are saying we do not like the proliferation of legal \nchallenges that are coming up in different legislation. We want to stop \nthat. This bill is a lawyer's employment act. This bill ought to be \napplauded by every member of the bar association, every student in law \nschool because this represents potential work.\n  There is a case to be made for regulatory reform. I am for that. \nSenator Glenn is for that. All of us in this Chamber are for that. We \nhave limited resources to spend on environmental protection. It is \nessential that we spend those resources wisely. More science, better \nrisk assessment, peer review, all of these, if done right, will do a \nbetter job protecting health and natural resources. The regulatory \nreform bill now pending will not result in smarter or more cost-\neffective environmental laws and regulations. Rather, it will cause \nregulatory gridlock. It will entangle agencies in a web of procedures \nand paperwork and endless rounds of review and make the implementation \nof our environmental laws nearly impossible.\n  This bill would substantially increase the number and complexity of \ncourt challenges to environmental regulations. There are nearly a dozen \nnew ways to get a regulation before court under this bill even before \nthe final action has been taken. This bill would result in lawsuits. Is \nthere a Senator who believes that more lawsuits will lead to \n\n[[Page S 9685]]\nbetter regulation? The Federal courts are not the place to decide \nquestions of science and economics that will be assigned under this \nbill.\n  Congress, because we are upset about the cost of health and \nenvironmental regulations, is impatient, is too impatient to wait for a \nstatute-by-statute review of its own enactments. It is us and the laws \nthat we have passed which have resulted in all these rules. What we \nought to do is look at these laws and examine the rules under them. But \nwe should not turn everything into a judicial review that goes up to \nour courts.\n  Mr. President, no doubt we will hear many horror stories about \nenvironmental regulations while this bill is being debated. And many \nhave been paraded already. But we ought not to lose sight of the big \npicture. These laws have worked. They have improved the quality of life \nfor all Americans. Let me give you some examples.\n  In a period that has seen significant growth in population, \nsignificant growth in industrial activity and in automobile travel, we \nhave more than held our own against the most difficult air pollution \nproblems. Between 1975 and 1990--that is a 15-year period--the total \nvehicle miles traveled in the United States increased by 70 percent. It \nwent from 1.3 trillion miles to 2.2 trillion miles driven in a year--a \n70-percent increase in mileage driven in the United States in 15 years. \nIn that same period, the vehicle emissions of hydrocarbons, which is \none of the pollutants that cause smog, were cut nearly in half. Up went \nmileage by 70 percent, pollutants, emissions of hydrocarbons dropped by \nnearly 50 percent, from 10 million tons to 5.5 million tons a year.\n  Now, that just did not happen. That did not come about because \nindustry wanted to do it. It came about because of Government \nregulation. We required the automobile industry to produce a car that \nwould reduce emissions by 90 percent, and they did it. Just since 1990, \nin only 5 years, between now and 1990, the number of areas in violation \nof the carbon monoxide standard in this country have dropped from 40 \nareas to less than 10. Since the mid-1970's, lead in the air is down by \n98 percent. The amount of lead in the air has decreased by 98 percent--\n98 percent. Why do we care about this? Because lead in the air affects \nthe developmental capacity of children growing up in congested urban \nareas. These are the most vulnerable Americans. And who are they? They \nare low-income areas, they are poor children who live there, and we \nhave cut the lead in those areas by 98 percent. If this bill had been \nin place during that time, EPA Administrator Carol Browner has said \nthat we could not have achieved those reductions in lead in gasoline. \nThat marvelous accomplishment that we are so proud of could not have \nbeen achieved with a strict cost-benefit analysis.\n  The Clean Water Act is probably our most successful environmental \nlaw. In the late 1960's, the Nation was stunned when the Cuyahoga River \nin Cleveland caught fire. A river caught fire. That shows you the \ncondition of our rivers and lakes and streams in the latter part of the \n1960's. Our waters were being used as open sewers--the Potomac, \nabsolutely foul.\n  In responding to this problem, Congress passed the Clean Water Act in \n1972 and set some very ambitious goals including the elimination of all \ndischarges to surface waters by 1985.\n  Well, we did not meet that goal of 1985, but we have made a lot of \nprogress since the Cuyahoga River caught fire in the 1960's. When we \nbegan this effort under the Clean Water Act, more than two-thirds of \nour lakes, rivers and streams in the United States of America failed to \nmeet the clean water standards.\n  With these 20 years of effort behind us, some of our most polluted \nwaters--Lake Erie, the Potomac River, Narragansett Bay in my own \nState--have made remarkable recoveries. Today, those streams and lakes \nand bays are fishable and swimmable.\n  On the international scene, the United States has led the way as the \nworld has faced up to the threat of ozone depletion. Each new \ndevelopment in our scientific understanding of chlorofluorocarbons and \ntheir impact on the ozone layer has confirmed the wisdom of the \nMontreal Protocol, the global agreement to ban production of CFC's that \nwas signed by a Republican President in 1987, President Reagan.\n  Since the Endangered Species Act was passed in 1973, populations of \nwhooping cranes, brown pelicans, and peregrine falcons have come back \nfrom near extinction. The bald eagle is ready to be moved from the \nendangered to the threatened list. Both the California gray whale and \nthe American alligator have recovered to the point they have been \nremoved from the endangered list altogether.\n  Now, what does all this mean to us? The American people can be proud \nof the accomplishments that have been made under the Clean Air Act, the \nClean Water Act, the Endangered Species Act, and our other \nenvironmental laws over the past quarter of a century, and the American \npeople are proud of this. And when asked, most often they say that we \nhave not been tough enough on water pollution and air pollution. They \nwant us to do more. They want Government to work better. But they want \nit to continue working for the health and environmental goals that have \nbeen achieved and are being achieved in our country today. The American \npeople cherish their right to their property and the right to pass it \non to their children free from pollution.\n  So I think, Mr. President, we have a lot to be proud of that we have \nachieved under the existing laws. I certainly hope we do not get \ninvolved with this cost-benefit business and this plethora of lawsuits \nthat would result from this legislation.\n  I wish to thank the Chair.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Snowe). The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. The legislation that is before us is not about whether \nor not the Government should write regulations or whether or not we \nshould have regulators. That is an accepted fact. It has been a part of \nthe process of Government a long time before we had the Administrative \nProcedure Act in 1946. All that did was basically conform all \nregulation writing to the same process.\n  This legislation is about bringing common sense to the whole process \nof writing regulations.\n And all of the horror stories that can be told about bad regulations \nand the bad enforcement of maybe even good regulations is related to \nthe fact that people affected feel that there is not a commonsense \napproach to the regulation writing. The bottom line is, that we need \nlegislation to bring common sense to regulation and the enforcement of \nregulation.\n\n  This legislation before us does that. And yet there are people that \nare coming to present possible horrors that will result if this \nlegislation is passed. This is just not so as far as I am concerned. \nThis legislation is not going to change any existing laws on the books \nthat deal with public health, and safety, environmental laws. Not one.\n  There are many false accusations about this legislation that it would \noverride existing law. There are a half-dozen places in the legislation \nthat makes it clear that this legislation is not a supermandate \nimposing the language of this legislation in place of any specific \npublic health and safety laws on the books. But this legislation is \nabout process to make sure that regulation writers cannot go hog wild \nin trying to accomplish their goals.\n  This legislation has in it judicial review of regulation writing, and \njudicial review of regulatory activity, and judicial review of the \nactions of regulators. We ought to have judicial review to make sure \nthat the process conforms to the statute and to the intent of Congress. \nRegulation writing and the process of analyzing information that goes \ninto regulation writing and particularly scientific analysis should not \nbe above the law. And the only way I know to assure that regulators do \nnot go beyond congressional intent is to make sure that there is \njudicial review. Well, there are an awful lot of accusations from \nopponents of this bill that somehow if this bill becomes law it is \ngoing to compromise public health and safety. On the other hand, those \nof us who are proponents of this legislation can give example after \nexample of where the existing process, without the proper safeguards in \nthe existing legislation, have become a real horror for certain \nindividuals who are affected.\n  Yesterday I had the opportunity to present an instance in which an \ninformant who was a former disgruntled \n\n[[Page S 9686]]\nemployee, brought to the attention of EPA the possibility of the \nburying of some toxic waste on the business of the Higman Gravel Co. of \nAkron, IA. And, of course, there was not any such toxic waste buried \nthere. But they acted on information of an informant and one morning at \n9 o'clock came to the place of business. It was a usual morning at the \nbusiness. Mr. Higman was gassing up his truck to start the process of \nwork for that day. His accountant was behind the desk in the office \ndoing what you would expect accountants to do. And all of a sudden that \nquiet morning, 40 local and Federal law enforcement agents come with \ncocked guns to this place of business telling Mr. Higman to shut up \nwhile the gun was pointed at him. They had, by the way, bulletproof \nvests on. They went into the office and stuck the gun in the face of \nthe accountant. All of that in a little place of business, acting \nbecause a disgruntled employee had given some misinformation.\n  It cost Mr. Higman $200,000 in legal fees and lost business and \nprobably still injured his reputation to some extent. But he had to \nfight it in the courts to get out of criminal charges that were \nunjustified. Now, just a little bit of common sense in the process of \nregulation writing in the process of enforcement could have saved a lot \nof trouble, damaged reputation for a good businessperson, damaged \nreputation for the legitimate work of the EPA.\n  I have another example that I would like to refer to because some \npeople are making the argument that environmental legislation should \nnot be subject to cost-benefit analysis or to risk assessment because a \nprice tag cannot be placed on an individual's health.\n  There is not a price tag placed upon individual health. But when it \ncomes to cost-benefit analysis, if there is a $5 cost to saving a life, \nor a $50 cost to saving a life, what is wrong with taking the $5 cost \nto saving a life as opposed to the $50 cost of saving a life? Common \nsense would dictate that you ought to use the less costly approach. But \npeople are arguing that requiring the EPA to assess and scrutinize the \ncost of regulations will somehow lead to a rollback of environmental \nprotection.\n  Now, I agree that a price tag cannot be placed on the health of \ncitizens. And we do not intend to roll back the gains made in \nenvironmental protection in this country over the last 25 years. \nSenator Chafee, who we have just heard, the distinguished chairman of \nour Environment Committee, is correct. Many gains have been made in \nenvironment in the last 25 years. And we should not turn our backs on \nthese significant achievements.\n  But once again, if the question is a $50 cost to saving a life versus \na $5 cost to saving a life, we would chose the $5 approach. The life is \ngoing to be saved either way. And we want that life saved.\n  So I want to take the opportunity to discuss at least one example \nwhere conducting a cost-benefit analysis would have avoided the \nenactment of an absurd regulation that has cost small businesses in my \nState and many other States hundreds of thousands of dollars and has \nresulted in absolutely no benefit to the environment, absolutely no \nbenefit to the environment. The 1990 Clean Air Act amendments regulate \nwhat are called major sources of emissions and it defines ``major \nsources'' as those that have the potential to admit 100 tons per year \nof a criteria pollutant, such as dust. The EPA in further defining \n``potential'' to emit assumes that facilities operate 24 hours a day, \n365 days a year.\n  Now that is quite an assumption--sitting in a marble palace someplace \nin Washington, DC, to assume when you are writing a regulation that \nevery business is going to operate 365 days a year, 24 hours a day.\n  When you apply that faulty logic to a seasonal business, such as \ngrain elevators in my State--and if some of you are confused about the \nterm ``grain elevator,'' just let me simply say, that is a big cement \nsilo where you store grain, where the farmers deliver grain, where \ngrain can be processed from or grain can, in turn, be loaded onto \nhopper cars to be shipped to another location, even overseas when it \ngets to the terminal. But when you apply this faulty logic, assuming \nthat a business is going to operate 365 days a year, 24 hours a day, \nfor grain elevators, it becomes evident how absurd this regulation is \nin practice and how a simple cost-benefit analysis would have \nillustrated this fact.\n  In my State of Iowa, we have approximately 700 grain elevators. I \nthink I know what I am talking about when I talk about a grain \nelevator. My son and I have a family farming operation. My son operates \nit almost totally by himself. I try to help when I am home and we are \nnot in session.\n  In the fall of the year, my son runs what we call a combine, a grain-\nharvesting machine. This combine harvests our corn and our soybeans. \nOne of the things I can do to help my son in the fall is to haul the \ngrain, the corn, or the soybeans from the combine from the field 3 or 4 \nmiles into town to weigh and to unload at our local New Hartford \nCooperative elevator close to our farm.\n  We deliver grain to these local country elevators. We have 700 of \nthese in the State of Iowa, and there are about 96,000 farming units in \nmy State that use these 700 elevators to sell their corn to and to \nprocess their grains.\n  Although less than 1 percent of these elevators actually emit more \nthan 100 tons, which is what EPA has defined as the level to be \nclassified as a ``major source,'' if you use EPA calculations, all 700 \ngrain elevators in Iowa are considered major sources of emission. Only \n1 percent actually emit more than 100 tons, but all 700 grain elevators \nare affected by this regulation.\n  How this could be the case ought to defy all logic and does. During a \nsubcommittee hearing that I conducted on the bill before us, we heard \ntestimony from an operator of a grain elevator in Mallard, IA, in \nnorthwest Iowa. This particular elevator takes in grain for only 30 to \n40 days per year and has a capacity of 3 million bushels. But according \nto the EPA, this little country elevator in Mallard, IA, has the \ncapacity to process over 11 billion bushels of grain per year. Let us \nput this 11 billion bushels of grain per year EPA figures this grain \nelevator can handle in the context of our crop for 1 year in the entire \nUnited States.\n  Last year, the U.S. corn harvest set a record at 10.3 billion \nbushels. This year, because of the early rain in some parts of the \nMidwest, the USDA is projecting a 7 to 8 billion bushel harvest. Yet, \nthe Environmental Protection Agency assumes that 11 billion bushels of \ncorn, more corn than has ever been produced in this country in a year, \nwill go through that one country elevator in Mallard, IA.\n  This calculation, of course, would be laughable but for the fact this \nelevator will expend a lot of money and a lot of time as a result of \nthis EPA regulation. Last fall, at the height of harvest, the Mallard \nelevator received a 280-page permit application based upon the \nregulation I am talking about. The application is so complex that the \nelevator's managers were required to obtain an outside consultant to \nhelp complete the application. The cost of this assistance is estimated \nto be in the neighborhood of $25,000 to $40,000. Remember that my State \nhas about 700 of these elevators, all required to pay up to $40,000 to \ncomply with an absurd regulation.\n  So there is a very identifiable cost associated with this regulation \nfrom EPA in terms of money, in terms of time and in terms of jobs. The \nbenefit to the environment and to the public health is less clear, \nhowever. In other words, I am about to say that there is no need for \nthis regulation because there is not any impact on the public health, \nwhat the EPA assumes is a health problem.\n  First of all, all emissions from grain elevators are in the form of \ndust, and that is not considered toxic. Second, these dust particles--\nif you want to know where the dust comes from, I told you how you take \nthe grain from the field off the combine, on the wagon behind the \ntractor or in your truck to the local grain elevator. You weigh it \nbefore you unload it. Then you pull into a pit with a grate over it. \nYou drive your tractor over the grate, you open up the door and the \ngrain unloads. While this grain is falling about 2 or 3 feet into the \npit, there is some dust associated with that grain. Farmers live with \nthat every day on the farm. EPA does not try to interfere on the farm, \n\n[[Page S 9687]]\nbut they do try to interfere when you haul your grain to town and \nunload it.\n  Those dust particles are fairly large in size. They are just specks, \nin a sense, but fairly larger in size than most of the types EPA is \ntrying to regulate. They fall to the ground, after the winds have \ncaught them, and they may blow away from where you are unloading. They \nfall to the ground. They never enter the atmosphere.\n  Thus, if there is even a remote chance the particles can be harmful, \nthe group most at risk are the employees of the facility. Are we \nconcerned about the employees of the facility? Yes, we are concerned \nabout the employees' health. But this concern has already been \naddressed by OSHA regulations; not EPA regulations, but OSHA \nregulations. In fact, the elevator that I talked about, the Mallard \nelevator, spent $12,000 in 1994 for training and equipment to ensure \nthe safety of its employees who work around grain dust.\n  The primary reason that the regulation results in little public \nhealth benefit, however, is that these elevators have actual emissions \nof well under 100 tons,\n and, in most cases, well under 20 tons.\n\n  Under the Clean Air Act, they are not required to reduce emissions, \nbut they are still covered by the regulations. So after spending hours \ncompleting a 280-page application and paying maybe up to $40,000 to a \nconsultant to help fill out this 280-page application, the result is \nthat emissions are not reduced at all. They are not reduced at all.\n  This type of regulation--one that seems to impose large costs on \nsmall businesses and individuals without any public benefit--is exactly \nthe reason we need a cost-benefit analysis, and exactly the type of \nregulation that is now saddling the public, and we will avoid saddling \nbusinesses in the future if we pass S. 343. But, you see, we have \nregulators that do not know when to quit regulating. They do not stop \nto think, Well, should we really be regulating this or that? They get \nsome sort of a pseudo-science to justify some regulation, and some of \nthese agencies even ask scientists from academia to come in and review \ntheir scientific analysis which is the basis for their regulation \nwriting. We can show you examples of when those scientific panels have \ncome in and said, ``You have to go back and start over again. There is \nno scientific basis for the regulation you are writing.''\n  But they are not looking for a scientific basis for regulation. They \nare only looking for a small part of a scientific justification for \nwhat they want to do anyway. They want to do what they want to do, \nregardless of the cost. And this legislation will impose some common \nsense on the regulation writers, which common sense, if it were used, \nwould not have resulted in a regulation that affects 700 grain \nelevators in my State when, in fact, only 1 percent are over the EPA \nlimit. And if the rule were only applicable to the time that the \nbusiness was creating dust in the first place--how stupid to assume \nthat a business is going to be emitting dust into the air 365 days out \nof the year, 24 hours a day, when it only probably operates about 10 \nhours a day, and the activity they want to control only takes place \nmaybe 30 to 40 days out of a year.\n  We are entitled to some commonsense regulation, and we are never \ngoing to get it until we have legislation that dictates that we use a \ncommonsense approach. This legislation does it.\n  Mr. DOLE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. DOLE. I will be happy to yield.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Madam President, we have been debating the Dole \namendment here all today. I have heard really no criticism at all on \nthe Dole amendments. If our side is willing to accept those on a voice \nvote, and I do not know that they are, is the majority leader willing \nto let those go on a voice vote? Or does he want----\n  Mr. DOLE. I think we want a rollcall. I read so much about this from \nJoan Claybrook and Ralph Nader, I want them to be assured by a \nunanimous vote that we heeded the great contribution, not only that \nthey made, but the New York Times and other extremely----\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Does the Senator wish a rollcall on all the amendments \nor just the first one?\n  Mr. DOLE. I think if we had a rollcall on the first one, then I \nassume the others could be disposed of by voice vote. We would be glad \nto ask consent that vote occur at 5:30.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. At 5:30.\n  Mr. DOLE. Could I get consent? I make the request there occur a vote \nat 5:30 on amendment No. 1493 and, if the amendment is agreed to, \namendment No. 1942, as amended, be agreed to, and amendments numbered \n1494 and 1495 be automatically withdrawn, and that the time between now \nand 5:30 be equally divided in the usual form.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. GLENN. Reserving the right to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. GLENN. I do not object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator withdraws his objection.\n  Hearing no objection, it is so ordered.\n                  one last point on e. coli amendment\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Madam President, this morning, my friend Senator Glenn, \ncriticized S. 343 for not containing an explicit and separate provision \nexempting regulations dealing with food safety and E. coli bacteria.\n  To be fair, Senator Glenn recognized that S. 343 contains emergency \nprovisions that would allow agencies to quickly deal with bad meat and \nE. coli emergencies.\n  He recognized that this was a good thing, but he also stated that \nthis may not be enough because such emergency provisions leave too much \nto agency discretion. Perhaps a separate provision just dealing with E. \ncoli bacteria is needed, he concluded.\n  Now I want to point out that Senator Glenn's own substitute does not \ncontain a separate provision dealing with E. coli bacteria and bad \nmeat.\n  Instead, the Glenn bill also contains an emergency provision that \nexempts rules from risk assessment requirements when there exists a \nthreat to public safety.\n  This is exactly the approach the Dole bill takes. You simply cannot \nspecifically exempt all emergencies that may arise that requires a \nspeedy promulgation of a rule.\n  If you did that you would have to enumerate every disease and natural \ncatastrophe that ever existed. The bill would become too long and would \nwind up looking like one of those 100 page insurance policies.\n  I support the Dole amendment not because it is necessary--rules that \nneed be quickly promulgated because of an emergency and agency safety \ninspection and enforcement actions are already exempt from S. 343's \nrequirements--but because adding the words ``food safety'' in the \nemergency provision may somehow quell the unnecessary hype over food \nsafety and the myth that S. 343 does not protect the public.\n  Mr. CRAIG addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Madam President, I yield 10 minutes to the distinguished \nSenator from Idaho.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Madam President, it appears we are about to vote on the \nDole amendment to S. 343. I must say, I am extremely pleased the \nRepublican leader came to the floor this morning and propounded this \namendment to stop what I have watched over the last week--at best, \njournalistic silliness and a tremendous effort to distort what are, in \nfact, facts and realities as it relates to certain processes that have \ngone on and are still going on at the Department of Agriculture.\n  When I read headlines in the New York Times that suggest--and they \ndid--``Let Them Eat Poison, Republicans Block a Plan That Would Save \nLives,'' I say that is in fact a knowledgeable and outright distortion \nof the facts as we know them and certainly as this Senator knows them.\n  So, for the next few moments I would like to relate to you some \nunique experiences I have had serving on the Senate Agriculture \nCommittee that have dealt directly with the issue of the E. coli \nbacteria and what this Congress and this administration has attempted \nto do and, in some instances, has failed to do.\n  First, I want to talk about how they are playing fast and loose with \nthe \n\n[[Page S 9688]]\nfacts with, in my opinion, a direct effort to generate public attitude, \nand, in this instance, the attitude would be one of fear. Second, I \nwant to talk about this administration, what it can do, if it is \nsincere in helping improve food safety, with or without S. 343. And I \nwant to show it is flatout wrong to claim that this bill, S. 343, and \nall of the proceedings to it, along with this amendment, are going to \ndo one single thing to damage food safety in this country.\n  Madam President, we take for granted, in the United States, that we \nhave the safest food supply in the world--and we should take it for \ngranted because we do. We are indisputably a nation that places before \nits consuming public the safest of all food supplies.\n  Let me suggest that, when I make that statement, I do not suggest \nthat all food is, on all occasions, absolutely, every day, totally \nsafe. New regulations do not save lives; safe food processes save \nlives. And it is phenomenally important for us to remember that the \nresponsibility of safe food lies with everyone involved, in \nproduction--that is the one side we are talking about, because that is \nwhere the rules and regulations are--and on the consumption side, and \nthat is where you and I and all other consumers, Madam President, have \na responsibility.\n  Here is an interesting statistic that has been ignored by the press \neven though they know it. From 1973 to 1987 the Centers for Disease \nControl, which I think has credibility, reported that 97 percent of \nfoodborne illnesses were attributable to errors that occurred after \nmeat and poultry leave the plant; in other words, leave the processing \nplant, the slaughterhouse, the preparation plant, the packing area, if \nyou will, however you wish to describe it; 97 percent of all foodborne \nillnesses are attributed after that. Yet, the debate today, and the \nfoolish rhetoric in the press, has been on the other side of that \nissue.\n  Why have they missed the point? How could they come to be or appear \nto be so ignorant to the fact? Is it because they want it to be? Is it \npossibly because they want to distort the basis of the debate and the \narguments behind why this Congress is moving S. 343?\n  Most foodborne illnesses can be prevented with proper food handling \nor preparation practices in restaurants and in home kitchens. Observers \nthis afternoon might say this Senator has a bias. He comes from a life \nin the cattle industry. Madam President, my bias does not exist there \nbecause when the debate on E. coli began 2\\1/2\\ years ago--I come from \na beef-producing State. But we had young people in our State growing \nill, and in one instance a near death, because of a contaminated \nhamburger eaten at a fast food restaurant in my home State of Idaho. So \nI was clearly caught in the middle of this debate.\n  I, working along with the then Secretary Espy, began to move rapidly \nto try to solve this problem because it was an issue whose time had \ncome and it was important that the Congress of the United States face \nand deal with food inspection in this country when they had in fact \nfailed for years and years to do so.\n  So let me suggest to you that one of the arguments that has to be \nplaced before the American consumer is simply this: True methods that \ntranscend generations of Americans, whether we inspect the way we \ninspect or whether we regulate the way we regulate, or whether we \nchange the rules of the cause and effect, the bottom line is you cook \nyour meat and your poultry thoroughly. And if there is an example--and \nthere is argumentatively statistics today--that suggest there is an \nincrease in E. coli poisoning and bacterial poisoning, I believe it is \nbecause the consuming public no longer has the knowledge or has not \ngained the knowledge that you have to prepare your food properly. They \njust expect the Government to put on the plate every day and at all \ntimes safe food.\n  Let me suggest to the person who is the preparer of food--and that is \nall of us--that you just do not pop it in the microwave. You had better \nlearn that food that is improperly prepared can in fact be life-\nthreatening on occasion, if you mishandle it. And in 97 percent of the \ncases between 1973 and 1989 that was in fact the fact. I do not think \nthat any of us today should be confused by the playing or the \ngamesmanship that has gone on with this issue.\n  To the critics that claim that Government should bear all the \nresponsibility of food safety, I think you can tell by my expression \nthis afternoon that I just flatly disagree. However, I do want to make \none point. The administration has had the authority to address any food \nsafety issues and in my opinion has not delivered. They have worked at \nit for 2\\1/2\\ years. What happened? When an industry pleads with them \nto bring on new regulation because the appearance of food that is not \nsafe damages the reputation of the industry, it obviously causes great \nconcern to the consumer. Yet, this administration has stumbled \nrepeatedly inside USDA to bring about a new set of standards and \nregulations that the industry placed before them and said, Please do \nit. Please bring about processing that results in a regulatory effort \nthat will cause in all appearances and hopefully in reality safe food.\n  Why has it not happened? Why are we still generally operating under a \nstandard that was put in place in 1906? Is it because of the political \ninterests? Is it because of the tug and pull of a labor interest that \nsimply said, ``We will not give up our featherbedding and our employees \nfor a safer, more scientific process?'' Oh, yes. Madam President, that \nis part of the debate that somehow we wanted to quietly skirt around \nwhen in fact it is fact, and that is why the food safety and inspection \nservice in our country has been locked in a static environment since \n1906, unwilling to move with the times and unwilling to move with the \nscience of today.\n  But today's challenges are microbiological in nature. It is not a \nmatter of sight. It is not a matter of inspecting because of an animal \ndisease whether meat appears to be safe or it is not safe. It is really \nnow a question of science. It is a question of bringing on line a \ntechnique that we all know exists out there. It is called HACCP. It is \ncalled hazardous analysis and critical control point.\n  These are the issues at hand, Madam President. That is why we are \nhere debating today. Is there blame to cast around? Oh, yes, there is. \nBut blame should not rest with this legislation. Blame should rest with \npast Congresses and past administrations that were unwilling to bring \non line the kind of scientific food inspections that our country and \nour consumers deserve today.\n  I hope the Dole amendment will take away from this debate the kind of \ngamesmanship that was clearly going on in the press of this country \nbecause I think it ought to be stopped. My guess is the vote today will \ndo so.\n  Opponents of regulatory reform claim it endangers health and safety--\nespecially in the area of food safety. I am here to set the record \nstraight.\n  First, I want to talk about how they are playing fast and loose with \nthe facts, to generate public fear.\n  Second, I want to talk about what the Clinton administration can do \nif it is sincere about helping to improve food safety.\n  Third, I will show that it is flatout wrong to claim this bill will \ndo anything to endanger food safety.\n\n\n                            safe food supply\n\n  We take for granted that in the United States of America we have the \nsafest food supply in the world.\n  New regulations do not save lives. Safe food processes save lives. \nThe responsibility for safe food lies on everyone involved in the \nproduction and consumption.\n  For the time period from 1973-87, the Centers for Disease Control \nreported that 97 percent of foodborne illnesses were attributable to \nerrors that occur after meat and poultry leaves the plant. Most \nfoodborne illness can be prevented with proper practices in restaurants \nand home kitchens.\n  The best way to ensure that food is safe is a tried and true method \nthat transcends the generations: Cook your meat and poultry thoroughly. \nThe basic rule of thumb is that meats should be cooked until the fluids \nrun clear and the internal temperature has reached 160 degrees \nFahrenheit.\n  Unfortunately, that lesson has not always been heeded. In my \ngrandmother's scrapbook there is an article detailing the death of a \nfamily of six near Cambridge, ID, due to improper food preparation. \nThis unfortunate occurrence took place in 1929. As you can \n\n[[Page S 9689]]\nsee, the issue of food safety is not a new one.\n  The food preparer and consumer always have and still must accept \nultimate responsibility for food safety. Unfortunately, that \nresponsibility, along with all others in this life, occasionally bears \na consequence.\n  To the critics that claim the Government should bear all \nresponsibility for food safety--I must disagree. However, I want to \npoint out that this administration has had the authority to address any \nfood safety issue and has not delivered.\n  A number of petitions from industry to utilize existing technology \nand improve food safety have been stalled at the U.S. Department of \nAgriculture. One example is a steam vacuum that can be used to remove \ncontamination from carcasses. Only after multiple requests did the Food \nSafety and Inspection Service even allow a testing period to begin. It \nis not right for fingers to recently be pointed at the Republican \nParty, when this administration has consistently delayed food safety \nimprovement and reform.\n  The administration's response to this issue and others in meat \ninspection was released in February 1995, and has since been nicknamed \nthe ``mega reg.''\n  Mega reg, as introduced by the Food Safety and Inspection Service \n[FSIS]: The current meat inspection system is outdated and outmoded. \nEstablished in 1906, the system has remained largely unchanged and \nrelies on visual inspections of every carcass to ensure safety. That \nmade sense at the turn of the century when animal diseases were a major \nconcern.\n  But today's challenges are microbiological in nature. Because it is \nso difficult to detect microbiological problems, and because it is \nimpossible to see bacteria, the best approach is one of prevention. \nSuch an approach is called hazard analysis and critical control points \nor HACCP.\n  Unfortunately, the administration chose to combine both of these \nchoices rather than make clear and sweeping reform.\n  Most troubling is the fact that the administration's proposal would \nnot replace the old outdated system, as has been recommended by \nscientific groups including the National Academy of Sciences and the \nGeneral Accounting Office. Instead, mega reg would layer a host of new, \ncostly requirements on top of the weak foundation that is the current \ninspection system.\n  Almost everyone involved, including consumers and the meat and \npoultry industry, agrees that change is imperative. But the current \nproposal does not embody these critical improvements. In fact, the \ncurrent proposal cannot deliver on its promises and will largely be a \nhollow promise to consumers who are seeking safer meat and poultry.\n  When, not if, but when the system is overhauled, change must be \nenvisioned and implemented correctly. Not on the second or third try, \nbut the first time. Neither consumers, nor industry, can afford to pay \nfor the undue burden of unnecessary regulations.\n\n\n  the mega reg builds on a weak founda- tion--the current inspection \n                                 system\n\n  Unfortunately, the HACCP provisions in the mega reg would be layered \non top of the old system. These two systems do not blend. In fact, they \nactually work against one another. The current system tries to detect \nproblems, not prevent them. The HACCP portions of the mega reg try to \nprevent problems. This contradiction is not in the best interests of \nfood safety and the American consumer.\n  Additionally, the regulatory requirements of the two systems, when \ntaken together, are literally overwhelming to companies, especially \nsmall businesses, who fear that the new requirements would force them \nto close their doors. To make real progress, the current system must be \ndiscontinued so that a newer and stronger foundation can be laid.\n\n\n finished product microbiological testing sounds good, costs a lot and \n                            achieves little\n\n  The mega reg contains requirements for finished product \nmicrobiological testing, meaning that products would be tested at the \nend of the production process. To the lay person, this sounds like a \ngood idea. But in practical terms it doesn't work and it has been \nrejected by groups like the National Academy of Sciences and the \nGeneral Accounting Office.\n  Take the example of a test on a hamburger patty. Conceivably, one \nside might be negative for a particular bacteria while the other side \npotentially could be positive. So how does a plant know where it should \ntest? And how can it feel confident that test results ensure safety? \nThe best assurance is a process control system like HACCP. The only way \nto guarantee that a product is bacteria-free is to cook it properly.\n  So where does microbiological testing fit into meat processing? The \nbest approach is to use microbiological testing during the production \nprocess to ensure that processes are working as they should be, not at \nthe end of the process to try and find a needle in a haystack.\n\n\n   the mega reg would increase regulatory requirements, but does not \n                provide the necessary employee training\n\n  The meat and poultry industry is the second most regulated industry \nin the country, just behind the nuclear industry. On-site inspectors \nkeep track of reams of detailed requirements. The mega reg would add to \nthose requirements dramatically, but the nature of the new requirements \nwould be entirely different than earlier regulations.\n  If implemented, such a change calls for comprehensive training of \nthose who would enforce the regulations. But the proposal does not \naddress this issue. This omission has the potential to create chaos in \npractice.\n\n\n                        mega reg increases risk\n\n  For example, the FSIS proposal would require that plants be kept far \ncolder than they ever had before. These cold temperatures can help keep \nbacteria from developing, but can be harmful to workers. Cold \ntemperatures increase the risk of repetitive motion disorders.\n                            mega reg motives\n\n  The nature of change and seriousness of food safety underscores the \nneed to involve all parties equally. Although, the current \nadministration has spent over 2 years discussing meat inspection \nreform, their proposal does not satisfy anyone involved. For instance, \nthe industry is concerned that USDA has paid more attention to the \nconcerns of labor than it has to other groups, including packers and \nprocessors.\n  The union that represents meat and poultry inspectors is concerned \nabout new approaches to meat and poultry inspection because they fear \ntheir jobs may be at stake.\n  USDA's Acting Under Secretary for Food Safety Michael Taylor is an \nApril 7 memo told all FSIS employees that ``as we implement HACCP, we \nwill be expanding, not shrinking the range of regulatory roles and \ninspectional tasks required of our employees''.\n  But changes to the inspection system must be made based on what is \nscientifically sound, not based on the needs of any one special \ninterest group.\n  If food safety was really a priority to this administration they \nwould balance the needs of all affected interests. The administration \nwould enter into a process that could expedite meat inspection reform. \nThe administration has the authority, although it has not been used, to \nenter into negotiated rulemaking and devise an acceptable and effective \nsolution.\n  As written, the mega reg is not a solution to the needs of meat \ninspection and food safety. Utilizing the advances of modern science \nand technology would be a solution.\n\n\n         mega reg is unrelated to the dole-johnston substitute\n\n  Regardless of your position relating to the mega reg, it cannot be \ncited as a reason to oppose regulatory reform. The language in section \n622 of the substitute provides a ``health, safety or emergency'' \nexemption from the cost-benefit analysis and risk assessment \nrequirements if they are not practical due to an emergency or health or \nsafety threat.\n  In addition, section 624 of the substitute allows for an agency to \nselect a higher cost regulation when ``nonquantifiable benefits to \nhealth, safety or the environment'' make that choice ``appropriate and \nin the public interest''.\n  This regulatory reform bill focuses on the process of rulemaking and \nresults of regulation. It no way hinders the legislative process. \nCongress will still have full and complete authority to pass laws \naddressing health safety situations. Past laws that are already \n\n[[Page S 9690]]\non the books will not be superseded by bill.\n  Critics have targeted food safety. If the critics want food safety \nchange, they should address those in the administration with the power \nand authority to make meaningful and immediate change.\n  Whether it is food safety or any other area of our lives as U.S. \ncitizens, we must answer a fundamental question: What level of risk are \nwe willing to accept in our daily lives?\n  For example, one mode of transportation may be safer than another, we \noftentimes accept a small level of risk and choose the mode that takes \nus from point A to point B in the least amount of time.\n  Even though technology is constantly improving, it is unrealistic to \nthink we will ever live in a risk-free world. Instead of setting policy \nbased on a minuscule chance, we must set policy that is fair and \nresponsible.\n  The American public wants change in our process of setting public \npolicy. Supporting the Dole-Johnston substitute will reduce the overall \nregulatory burden, without harming public health or food safety.\n  Mr. BURNS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Abraham). Who yields time?\n  Mr. HATCH. How much time do we have on this side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Six minutes.\n  Mr. HATCH. I yield 5 of those 6 minutes to the distinguished Senator \nfrom Montana.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana is recognized.\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I thank the manager of the bill. We are \ngetting short on time.\n  Mr. President, I rise today in support of the Comprehensive \nRegulatory Reform Act. It has been a long time coming.\n  I am very impressed with the compromise that has been worked out and \nI think Senator Dole and Senator Johnston need to be congratulated.\n  To begin with, this bill brings some common sense back to Government \nand starts to give some much-needed relief to businesses all across our \nNation. But in Montana, where 98 percent of our businesses are small \nbusinesses, the onslaught of regulations in the past years have been a \nstranglehold. Regulations have a number of effects, two of which are to \ninhibit growth of a business and to discourage folks from even opening \na new business.\n  There is no doubt that some regulations are necessary. This bill will \nnot do away with all rules and regulations. What it will do is require \nthe regulating authority to justify the regulation. By requiring the \nagencies to do certain things, such as a cost-benefit analysis, we will \neliminate those ridiculous rules that seem to only add to the paperwork \nor cost of doing business.\n  Let me give you some examples. Earlier this year I held a field \nhearing in Kalispell, MT, to look at new regulations for logging \noperations. They range from silly to impractical to downright \ndangerous.\n\n\n                             safe workplace\n\n  One of the regulations requires a health care provider to inspect and \napprove first aid kits on logging sites once a year. It makes me wonder \njust how that health care provider would be reimbursed for that visit--\nis it a house call? Making certain that first aid kits contain the \nneeded supplies is certainly something the employer can do on his or \nher own. Requiring a health care provider to inspect each kit is \nludicrous.\n  Another regulation required loggers to wear foot protection that is \nnot even available. Specifically, they must have on waterproof, chain-\nsaw resistant, sturdy, ankle-supporting boots. If Kevlar boots were \navailable and affordable, they would not be flexible enough to wear in \nthe logging field. On top of this, the regulations charge the employer \nwith the responsibility of assuring that every employee has the proper \nboots, wears them and the employer must inspect them at the beginning \nof each shift to make sure they are in good condition.\n  Add to this the new requirement that the employer is now responsible \nfor inspecting any vehicle used off public roads at logging work sites \nto guarantee that the vehicle is in serviceable condition--and the \nemployer may as well spend all his time as a watch dog. Since when is \nan employer held responsible for the employee's property? Why should \nthey limit this to just loggers? Perhaps OSHA would like to require the \nU.S. Senate to ensure all our employees are commuting to and from the \nHill in cars that are serviceable.\n  But the regulations are not just burdensome, one regulation may even \nprove hazardous to the logger. They require the lower portion of the \noperator's cab to be enclosed with solid material to prevent objects\n from entering the cab. Unfortunately, when logging, you need to see \nbelow your cab. One gentleman who testified at my hearing said, ``Any \nrule that would require loggers to enclose areas of machines that \noperators need to see out of, in order to safely operate the machine, \nis poor logging practice.''\n\n  It became very clear during our proceedings that the OSHA paper \npushers who wrote these regulations had never felled a tree. They \nprobably had never even been at a logging site. And yet, the \nregulations written were to be enforced last February. It is only \nbecause of an outcry by the industry that these are now being reviewed.\n  But, Mr. President, this is just one example in just one industry. \nRegulations have been published that deal with fall protection on \nconstruction sites. They almost make me laugh. Requiring employers to \nhave their employees harnessed if they are higher than six feet, would \ncover anyone on top of a standard ladder. But they do give the employer \noptions. In the case of roofers, the employer can hire a roof monitor \nwho tells roofers when they get too close to the edge. Now that is \nridiculous.\n  By now, we have probably all heard the statistics before--the cost of \nregulations to our economy is staggering. Federal regulation costs have \nbeen estimated between $450 billion and $850 billion every year. That \nworks out to about $6,000 per household every year. That might be \nacceptable if we knew we were getting our money's worth. And that is \nwhat this is all about.\n  S. 343 will allow us to decide whether the benefits of the regulation \njustify the costs. That may not always be easy, but it's necessary. It \nis\n responsible. It will give us a tool to decide whether the regulation \nis truly needed and whether it is practical.\n\n  But one of the sections of this bill that I am most pleased with is \nthe congressional review. I have been calling for this since I arrived \nin the Senate. We pass laws here--that is our job. And then we leave it \nup to the agencies to write the rules and regulations. But we never get \nto review the final product. So, the law we pass and the rules enforced \nmay be completely different. They may not be what we intended at all.\n  S. 343 requires the regulating authority to submit a report to the \nCongress, spelling out the rule, making available the cost--benefit \nanalysis, and allowing the committees with jurisdiction to review the \nnew rules. And we have 60 days to decide whether the rule follows the \nintent of the law.\n  Now I know some folks are worried that we will be stifling rules that \nare meant to protect the safety and health of children. That will not \nhappen. Show me one person who would willingly put his family's or his \nconstituent's health at risk. Rules will still be promulgated, \nregulations will still go into effect, to protect the safety and health \nof all of us. What we will cut down on is the unnecessary red tape.\n  In 1991, the Federal Government issued 70,000 pages worth of \nregulations and in 1992 the Federal Government employed over 122,000 \nregulators. These are the people responsible for such regulations as \nthe prohibition of making obscene gestures in a National Forest. These \npeople are responsible for the regulation requiring outdoorsmen to \ncarry with them a bear box, to store perishables in while camping--a \nbox the size of which would require a horse to carry. And these \nregulations are responsible for the destruction of private property \nwhen land owners are prohibited from preventing erosion on their land \nin order to not disturb local beetles.\n  We need to restore common sense to Government. That may be a foreign \nnotion, but its time we try. This bill does that.\n  We passed unfunded mandates. We passed paperwork reduction. Now let \nus pass the Comprehensive Regulatory \n\n[[Page S 9691]]\nReform Act and give our businesses the relief they so desperately need.\n  Mr. President, let me reiterate that I rise today in support of the \nDole-Johnston substitute. I will tell you why, because I think for the \nfirst time maybe we bring back some common sense in this business of \nrulemaking.\n  I am very supportive of that part of this legislation that requires \nCongress to look at the final rule before it is published in the \nRegister and goes into effect. I have said ever since I came to this \nbody that this is what we have to do. For so many times after \nlegislation is passed by this Congress, and it is signed into law by \nthe President, it is turned over to some faceless people to write the \nadministrative rules. Sometimes those rules look nothing like the \nintent of the legislation.\n  But I want to talk about something today that probably in the \nrulemaking I think becomes very important.\n  Let me repeat that 98 percent of the businesses in my State of \nMontana are classified as small business. So we have a small business \npart in this piece of legislation to look into those things. There is \nno doubt in my mind that some regulations are necessary. Nobody in \nbusiness today, and especially those who have a very close relationship \nwith working men and women and their families, wants to have an unsafe \nworkplace. It just does not make good sense. For sure it is not good \nbusiness to have an unsafe workplace.\n  This bill will not do away with all of those rules and regulations. \nBut the regulating authorities have to justify the regulation by \nrequiring the agencies to do certain things, such as cost-benefit \nanalysis. It will eliminate some of those ridiculous rules that seem to \nonly add to paperwork and the cost of doing business. And they do very \nlittle to improve a safe workplace.\n  Earlier this year, I held a field hearing in Kalispell, MT, with \nregard to new regulations written for logging operations in our part of \nthe country. They range from the silly to the impractical and sometimes \ndownright outrageous.\n  Let me give you an example. One of the regulations required a health \ncare provider to inspect and approve first aid kits on logging sites \nonce a year. That is a health care provider. That is not somebody \nwithin the company going by every now and again and looking at the \nfirst aid kit to make sure all of the items are in there. That is just \ncommon sense.\n We do not need rules for that. I tell you what the rule was created \nfor. If your health care provider did not go and look at it, then that \nis the place for a fine. Back in 1990, I think we set up the \nreauthorization of OSHA a little bit differently; in the tax bill we \nhandled it a little differently. That is probably not meeting with \ngreat open arms in the public now.\n\n  Another regulation required loggers to wear a certain footwear \nprotection that was not even available and is not available today. They \nare Kevlar boots. Now, if they were here, the majority of the people \ncould not afford to wear them. On top of this, the regulations charge \nthe employer with the responsibility in assuring that all of the \nemployees have proper boots, primarily these boots, and inspect them \nevery day at the beginning of the shift to make sure they are in good \ncondition.\n  Now, add this to the new requirement that the employer is now \nresponsible for inspecting any privately owned vehicle that you and I \ndrive back and forth to work for safe condition and serviceable \ncondition. So what it meant was that the employer was the watchdog. He \nhad to even look at all the pickups and cars that you drove to work \nevery day. Of course, being in a mountain area, that is probably not a \nbad idea, but, my goodness, can you imagine the cost for the employer \njust to comply?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. BURNS. I rise in support of this amendment. And I appreciate what \nis trying to be done here. We realize that some rules and regulations \nare necessary.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. GLENN. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Chair advises the Senator from Utah he has 37 seconds remaining.\n  Mr. HATCH. Could I ask my colleague for a few more minutes?\n  Mr. GLENN. I yield 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I appreciate my colleague doing that \nbecause I strongly support, as I think most every Senator will, the \nDole amendment. I agree with Senator Dole; it is time to put these \nmyths to bed and these conjured-up illustrations that some of the far \nleft have been trying to pass on to the media and to an unsuspecting \nmedia, I have to say, because I personally do not believe these media \nwriters are literally going to just distort this the way they have \nwithout being fed the wrong material. So hopefully this will end some \nof these outrageous articles that literally are not based on fact and \nin fact are downright untruthful.\n  I cannot wait until tomorrow to bring up my next top 10 silly \nregulations. Let me start with 10.\n  No. 10. Trespassing on private land and seizing a man's truck on the \nclaim that he poisoned eagles even though the Federal Government had no \nevidence that he did so.\n  I just love these illustrations. We go to No. 9 in our list of top 10 \nright now.\n  No. 9. Fining a person $5,000 for filling an acre-large glacial \npothole and expanding another acre-large glacial pothole to 2 acres. In \naddition to fining him, they made him dig out the original pothole.\n  No. 8. Prohibiting a couple from preventing erosion on their \nproperty, which, of course, threatened their house, because the \nGovernment told them that it might destroy tiger beetles. So the tiger \nbeetles were more important than the individual property owners' house.\n  No. 7. Requiring elderly residents of a neighborhood to have to walk \nto a cluster mailbox to save time for the letter carrier while \nadmitting in a Postal Service self-audit that the average letter \ncarrier wastes 1.5 hours per day.\n  No. 6. Here is one example which I know my friend, Senator Murkowski, \nis familiar with. The use of a bear repellent was prohibited because it \nhad not been proven effective in spite of the fact that Alaskan \nresidents have successfully fended off bear attacks with it many times.\n  No. 5. Admonishing the Turner Broadcasting System for showing 15 \nseconds too many commercials during a January 14, 1992 broadcast of Tom \nand Jerry's Funhouse. I will hurry since I see that the minority leader \nis here.\n  No. 4. Prohibiting the construction of levees for rice production in \nspite of the fact that it would have increased the amount of wetlands.\n  No. 3. Prosecuting a company for ``conspiring to knowingly transport \nhazardous waste'' because the waste water the company discharged \ncontained .0003 percent of methylene chloride. I might add that \ndecaffeinated coffee has a higher percentage.\n  No. 2. Attempting to fine a company over $46,000 because they \nunderpaid their multimillion dollars tax bill by 10 cents.\n  Let us just take a second and think about this No. 1, the silliest of \nall.\n  No. 1. Fining a poor electrician $600 because someone else left an \nextension cord on the job.\n  Well, this is my third list of top 10 silly regulations. I suspect it \nis a never-ending list, but I will endeavor to try to bring a few to \nour attention every day just to show why this bill is so important in \nwhat we are fighting for.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DASCHLE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Democratic leader.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, the debate that has been taking place all \nday today on the impact of this bill on food safety and specifically \nits impact on the Department of Agriculture's proposed rule to require \nscience-based hazard analysis and critical control point or HACCP \nsystems in meat and poultry plants is really very important.\n  Secretary Glickman sent a letter this morning to the majority leader \nand to \n\n[[Page S 9692]]\nme expressing his strong opposition to S. 343 because it would \nunnecessarily delay USDA's food safety reform, among other things. I \nbelieve Senator Glenn has submitted the letter for the record.\n  The letter explains that the peer review requirement in S. 343 will \ndelay USDA's food safety reform by at least 6 months. As I read this \nbill and Secretary Glickman's letter, the bill requires that risk \nassessments underlying both proposed and final regulations be peer \nreviewed prior to becoming final. And there has been a good discussion \nabout the applications of peer review this afternoon. In other words, \nbefore USDA can issue a final regulation reforming our meat and poultry \ninspection systems--a regulation that has been in the works for more \nthan 2 years and is based on more than 10 years' of reform efforts--S. \n343 would require that the final rule be peer reviewed. According to \nSecretary Glickman, this peer review requirement would result in a 6-\nmonth delay in this essential food safety reform. The Dole amendment \ndoes not address this unnecessary delay.\n As an initial matter, the amendment applies only to the cost-benefit \nsubchapter of S. 343. As I explained earlier, the delay that S. 343 \nwould impose is the result of the peer review requirements. So the \namendment really does nothing in this regard.\n\n  Even if the amendment were changed to apply to the risk assessment \nand peer review requirements, the amendment still would not address the \nunnecessary delay that S. 343 would impose. Consumers and agricultural \nproducers should not be asked to delay these essential reforms--reforms \nthe entire agriculture and consumer communities have been calling for \nnow for several years.\n  First, the Dole amendment simply adds food safety to the list of \nreasons an agency could declare an emergency and bypass the cost-\nbenefit requirements of the bill. But the bill already contains an \nemergency exemption to protect health. I believe a food safety \nemergency is by definition a health emergency. People get sick from \nunsafe food. So an agency acting to prevent or address a food safety \nthreat would be acting to protect health.\n  Even if the amendment does expand the scope of emergency by including \nfood safety, I do not believe that it will alleviate the unnecessary \ndelay that the bill would impose on USDA food safety reform.\n  USDA published the proposed rule in February of this year with a 120-\nday comment period. The USDA also extended the comment period at the \nrequest of a large number of commenters. Given this excessive comment \nperiod, if the USDA suddenly declared an exemption to avoid the peer \nreview delay, it would be opening itself to litigation and, \nunfortunately, greater delay.\n  I would also note that USDA attempted to publish food safety \nregulations a couple of years ago. To provide consumers with \ninformation on how to avoid foodborne illness from pathogens like E. \ncoli and salmonella, the USDA issued emergency recommendations \nproviding safe handling labels on meat and poultry products. These safe \nhandling regulations were issued without notice and comment. The USDA \nwas sued and lost and had to go through the rulemaking process before \nlabels could be required. The result, then, of that emergency provision \nwas delay.\n  In addition to the opportunities that this bill would create for \nlitigation--and which are not addressed by the Dole amendment--the bill \nalso affords opportunities for those opposed to these rules to \nchallenge them through the petition process. So even if we managed to \nget the rule released from USDA without delay--something that again \nwould not be guaranteed by the Dole amendment--the rule could be \nchallenged on the basis that it does not meet the decisional criteria \nin the bill and should therefore be weakened or could be subject to \npetitions calling for a repeal of the rule under the so-called lookback \nauthority.\n  In short, there are numerous hurdles that are created by this bill \nwhich effectively can be used to delay or prevent the issuance of these \nimportant rules or lead to their repeal. That is unacceptable.\n  Food safety reform is essential not only to provide American \nconsumers with safer food, but also to ensure that American \nagricultural producers have a strong market for their products. I \nunderstand the concerns that many in the agriculture community have \nwith USDA's proposed reform.\n  However, I was the chairman of the subcommittee that first conducted \nthe hearings on the tragic outbreak in 1993 and have held numerous \nfollowup hearings in which the industry, producers, and consumers have \nall repeatedly called for reforming and modernizing the meat and \npoultry inspection system. We can ill afford to delay these long-needed \nreforms. Yet that is precisely the outcome that will result under this \nbill even if this body adopts the current language in the Dole \namendment.\n  So, as my colleagues consider this amendment, I want there to be no \nmistake about its effect. It is a harmless provision, one I support, \nbut it will not fix the problem. It will do nothing to avoid the delay \nthat the bill will require in the USDA's food safety proposal.\n  Later in this debate, I will offer an amendment to fix the problem. \nMy amendment--in no uncertain terms--will ensure that this bill cannot \nbe used by those who would oppose efforts to improve food safety to \nprevent, delay the issuance of, or repeal the Department of Agriculture \nmeat inspection regulations regarding the E. coli. That seems to me to \nbe the right objective and one which I hope every Member of this body \nwill support.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Yes.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. I had three comments with respect to the Secretary's \nletter. First of all, his comments about peer review.\n  Mr. DASCHLE: I would be happy the yield for a question.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Yes. First of all, are you aware that the Glenn \nsubstitute has peer review in it of an even stronger variety than is \ncontained in S. 343?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Well, I think that is subject to some dispute. I \nunderstand that we have attempted to clarify the language and have \nfound a way to address the concerns raised by the Secretary.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. I would submit to my dear friend----\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I think the Secretary would find the language in the \nGlenn substitute much more to his liking than the Dole amendment.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. With all due respect, I would ask my friend to look at \nthe provisions. The only difference in the peer review in the Glenn \nsubstitute and in our peer review is that we do permit informal peer \nreview panels whereas the Glenn substitute does not. In other words, it \nis more stringent.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. If I could just respond to the Senator. If the Secretary \nwould find that the Glenn amendment is not as acceptable as he would \nlike it to be, I am sure we could accommodate the Secretary's concerns \nhere, just as we are doing with the pending bill.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. All right.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. The pending bill obviously is the bill before us. We \nhave to clarify that prior to the time we even have an opportunity to \nget to other amendments and the substitute. So, clearly that is what I \nthink most of us would like to do. And to address the Secretary's \nconcerns, let us address them. We may not have to address the language \nin the Glenn amendment or anything else. I think that is the issue. Can \nwe clarify the Dole amendment adequately enough to ensure that his \nconcerns are addressed and that we do not further encumber those \nefforts by the Department of Agriculture to promulgate these \nregulations in a timely manner?\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Is my friend aware of, on page 49 of the Dole-Johnston \namendment, where it explicitly says, ``This subchapter shall not apply \nto risk assessment performed with respect to--'' you go down to ``(C), \na human health, safety or environmental inspection, an action enforcing \na statutory provision, rule, or permit or an individual facility or \nsite permitting action, except to the extent provided''?\n  In other words, it exempts the human health, safety or environment \ninspection from the risk assessment.\n  Moreover, was my friend aware that under subsection (f) on page 25:\n\n       A major rule may be adopted and may become effective \n     without prior compliance with the subchapter if--(A) the \n     agency for \n\n[[Page S 9693]]\n     good cause finds that conducting cost-benefit analysis is impractical \n     due to an emergency or health safety threat that is likely to \n     result in significant harm to the public or natural resources \n     . . .?\n\n  So, in other words, my question is, is my friend--indeed, is the \nSecretary--aware that, first of all, inspections are exempt and, \nsecond, that you can go ahead and do a rule without either cost-benefit \nanalysis or a risk assessment if there is a threat to health or safety?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Let me respond to the distinguished Senator, my friend \nfrom Louisiana, in this manner. The Secretary has examined the language \nto which you refer. And it is the Secretary's view that it falls far \nshort of his standards and the expectations that he would apply to his \nown ability to address food safety. It is his view that this provision \nand many of the other provisions that the Senator has addressed in the \nlanguage of the legislation is deficient. What the Secretary is simply \nsaying is that unless we correct these deficiencies, his efforts to \nassure adequate standards and adequate confidence in our food safety \nsystem will be severely undermined. They are not my words. Those are \nthe words of the Secretary himself. But the Secretary is saying that if \nwe----\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. They are the Secretary's words.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. If I could again reconfirm that unless we address a \nnumber of these issues, the Secretary himself has indicated that it \npresents some serious problems for him, and he would advise we either \namend the legislation or support an alternative.\n  So I am hopeful that whether it is through an amendment, as I will be \nproposing later on, or through an alternative draft, as the Senator \nfrom Ohio is proposing, we will be able to address it in a meaningful \nway.\n  Again, I would like to address it through amendments that we will be \noffering, but whether it is through amendments or in some manner, I \nthink the deficiencies outlined by the Secretary ought to be of concern \nto everybody. It is in our interest and I think in the country's \ninterest to try to do a better job of addressing the concerns than we \nhave right now.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. One final short question. I ask my friend to read the \nSecretary's letter. It pertains only to risk assessment, which, as I \nsay, is contained in the Glenn-Daschle bill. That is all he talks \nabout. He does not talk about the exception. I invite you and the \nprincipal author of the alternative to read your own bill, and I invite \nthe Secretary to read the exceptions, because they except from the \noperation of risk assessment these inspections.\n  At an appropriate time, I will be offering an amendment to exempt all \nregulations where notice of proposed regulation was commenced prior to \nJuly 1, 1995, because I think there is a problem going back and looking \nat that, and maybe that will give us a basis on which to satisfy the \nSecretary and everybody else.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I think the Senator would be wise to do so. I think, \nagain, it confirms that there is a lack of clarification, there is \nuncertainty, enough so that the Secretary has seen fit to send a letter \nto express his concerns. I hope that we can clarify this issue and \nalter the provisions of the bill in whatever ways may be necessary. I \ndo not think we ought to minimize those concerns or the problems of the \nSecretary with regard to the issue before us right now. Food safety is \none of our greatest concerns, and we have to ensure that we do not \nundermine the confidence of the American people in our food supply as \nwe address the need for regulatory reform. That is all we are trying to \ndo--ensure that we accomplish regulatory reform in a meaningful way, a \ncomprehensive way, but do it in a way that does not encumber the \nSecretary's efforts to provide a better system of ensuring food safety \nthan we have right now.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I think the Secretary should read the bill \nand the comments of Senator Johnston, because they are completely \ndifferent from what he said in his letter.\n  I ask for the yeas and nays on the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, just a short while ago, CNN reported that \nthe so-called U.N. safe area of Srebrenica had fallen--Bosnian Serb \ntanks have reached the town center and thousands of the 40,000 Bosnians \nin the enclave have begun to flee.\n  The main argument made by the administration in opposition to \nwithdrawing the U.N. forces and lifting the arms embargo on Bosnia was \nthat such action would result in the enclaves falling and would lead to \na humanitarian disaster. Well, that disaster has occurred today--on the \nU.N.'s watch, with NATO planes overhead.\n  If it was not before, it should now be perfectly clear that the U.N. \noperation in Bosnia is a failure. Once again, because of U.N. \nhesitation and weakness we see too little NATO action, too late. Two \nSerb tanks were hit by NATO planes today--hardly enough to stop an all-\nout assault that began days ago. As a result, in addition to thousands \nof refugees, the lives of brave Dutch peacekeepers are in serious \ndanger.\n  Mr. President, there can be no doubt, the U.N.-designated safe areas \nare safe only for Serb aggression. What will it take for the \nadministration and others to declare this U.N. mission a failure? Will \nall six safe areas have to be overrun first?\n  It is time to end this farce. It is time to let the Bosnians do what \nthe United Nations is unwilling to do for them. The Bosnians are \nwilling to defend themselves--it is up to us to make them able by \nlifting the arms embargo.\n  Mr. President, I have just been on the telephone with the Prime \nMinister of Bosnia, along with Senator Lieberman, Prime Minister \nSilajdzic in Sarajevo. He was giving us the latest conditions in \nSrebrenica, one of the safe havens, where 40,000 men, women, and \nchildren are now fleeing Serb aggression. He also indicates that other \nsafe havens are under attack, or threatened attack.\n  It seems to me that if there was ever a moment when we ought to have \na \n\n[[Page S 9694]]\nunanimous vote in this Chamber, it ought to be when we take up the \nresolution to lift the arms embargo. I do not know how many times it \nhas been on the floor, how many votes we have had. We have had strong \nbipartisan support. And, in my view, I think it is growing.\n  I am not asking about committing American troops. We are talking \nabout giving these poor people who are being killed by the dozens every \nday a chance to defend themselves by lifting the arms embargo, which \nthey have a right to do as a member of the United Nations, an \nindependent nation under article 51 of the U.N. Charter.\n  The right of self-defense is an inherent right, in my view. We deny \nthem that right by not lifting the arms embargo.\n  I said before, the U.N. mission is a failure. I commend the courage \nof the U.N. protection forces there. But it seems to me that the policy \nis not going to change. They have had little pin pricks and they called \nthem air strikes. They knocked out two tanks. That was the effort by \nNATO. According to the Prime Minister, the U.N. representative, Mr. \nAkashi, waited until it was too late for the air strikes to have any \nimpact.\n  So we hope to work in a very bipartisan way--or a nonpartisan way, \nbetter yet--on this issue in the next week.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a fax just received in the last hour \nfrom the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina, from the Government's \nprime minister, Mr. Silajdzic, be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n         The Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina,\n                                                    July 11, 1995.\n     Hon. Rober Dole,\n     Majority Leader, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Dole: Today, the United Nations allowed the \n     Serb terrorists to overrun the demilitarized ``safe area'' of \n     Srebrenica. Helpless civilians in this area are exposed to \n     massacre and genocide. Once and for all, these events \n     demonstrate conclusively that the United Nations and the \n     international community are participating in genocide against \n     the people of Bosnia and Herzegovina.\n       The strongest argument of the opponents of the lifting of \n     the arms embargo toppled today in Srebrenica. They claimed \n     that the lifting the arms embargo would endanger the safety \n     of the safe areas. The people in Srebrenica are exposed to \n     massacre precisely because they did not have weapons to \n     defend themselves, and because the United Nations did not \n     want to protect them. Attacks are also under way against the \n     other safe areas in Bosnia and Herzegovina.\n       That is why we think it is extremely important that the \n     American Senate votes to lift the arms embargo on the \n     legitimate Government of Bosnia and Herzegovina.\n       If the Government of the United States of America claims \n     that it has no vital interests in Bosnia, why then does it \n     support the arms embargo and risk being associated with \n     genocide in Bosnia and Herzegovina?\n       It is essential that the elected representatives of the \n     American people immediately pass the bill to life the arms \n     embargo. This will provide a clear message that the American \n     people do not want to deprive the people of Bosnia and \n     Herzegovina of the right to defend themselves against \n     aggression and genocide.\n           Sincerely,\n                                             Dr. Harris Silajdzic,\n                                                   Prime Minister.\n\n  Mr. DOLE. I will conclude by saying we have always had the argument \nthat if we lifted the arms embargo, it would result in the fall of \nthese enclaves, these safe havens, and that would lead to humanitarian \ndisaster. That argument is gone today because it has been overrun by \nthe Serbs. Forty-thousand people are fleeing, and other safe havens are \nbeing attacked. So that argument is gone.\n  It ought to be perfectly clear that the U.N. operation is a failure. \nOnce again, because of U.N. hesitation and weakness, we see too little \nNATO action too late. Two Serb tanks were hit by NATO planes, hardly \nenough to stop the all-out assault that began days ago. As a result, \nthe lives of thousands of refugees and of the brave Dutch peacekeepers \nare in serious danger. The safe areas are safe only for Serb \naggression. They are not safe for anybody else--not for the poor \nMoslems who are there, not for the peacekeepers, or the U.N. Protection \nForces. They are being taken hostage again.\n  So what will it take for our Government and other governments to \ndeclare this U.N. mission a failure? Will all six areas have to be \noverrun? Maybe it will take that much.\n  So it is the view of many of us--and this is not partisan --that it \nis time to end this farce and let the Bosnians do what the United \nNations is unwilling to do for them. The Bosnians are willing to defend \nthemselves. In fact, this letter says that it is up to us to make them \nable by lifting the arms embargo. This letter says it is essential that \nthe elected representatives of the American people immediately pass a \nbill to lift the arms embargo. This will provide a clear message that \nthe American people do not want to deprive the people of Bosnia and \nHerzegovina of the right to defend themselves against aggression and \ngenocide and possible massacre of thousands of civilians.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/07/11/senate-section/article/S9693-1", "month": "07", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "11", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9694]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       NORMALIZATION WITH VIETNAM\n\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, as anticipated today, President Clinton, in \na ceremony at the White House, announced that he was taking steps to \nnormalize U.S. diplomatic relations with the Socialist Republic of \nVietnam.\n  In his statement, President Clinton cited progress in POW/MIA \ncooperation. But, unfortunately the President did not address the \ncentral issue, and that is, does Vietnam continue to withhold \ninformation and remains which could easily be provided?\n  The President ignored this question in announcing his decision, for \nthe very good reason that all signs point to Vietnam willfully \nwithholding information which could resolve the fate of many Americans \nlost in the war.\n  On Veterans Day in 1992, President-elect Clinton stated, ``There will \nbe no normalization of relations with any nation that is at all \nsuspected of withholding any information.'' That was President-elect \nClinton's standard. The standard was not simply cooperation.\n  The standard was not simply allowing field operations. The 1992 \nstandard was at all suspected of withholding any information. No \nnormalization if there is any suspicion of any withholding of any \ninformation. By 1994, the standard has clearly changed from suspected \nof withholding information to selective cooperation. As I said \nyesterday on the Senate floor at about this same time, if President \nClinton was unable to state unequivocally that Vietnam had done all it \ncould do, it would be a strategic, diplomatic, and moral mistake to \nbegin business as usual with Vietnam.\n  President Clinton has made his decision today. Congress has no say in \nthis decision. In the coming weeks and months, Congress will monitor \nthe progress of relations with Vietnam. Our role will not be passive. \nCongress must approve any additional funds for United States diplomatic \noperations in Vietnam. The Senate must confirm any U.S. Ambassador to \nVietnam. Any further improvement in relations will require action by \nCongress--granting of most-favored-nation status or beginning any \noperations by the Export-Import Bank, the Overseas Private Investment \nCorporation, or the Trade and Development Agency.\n  President Clinton said today that we should look to the future. I \nagree that we should look to the future, and examine future Vietnamese \ncooperation on POW/MIA issues, as well their record on human rights in \nthe aftermath of today's announcement. But as we look to the future we \nshould not and will not forget the past--especially the importance of \ndoing all we can to resolve the fate of those Americans who made the \nultimate sacrifice in Vietnam.\n  Mr. President, I yield the remainder of my leader time to the \ndistinguished Senator from North Carolina.\n  Mr. HELMS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, President Clinton's announcement today that \nthe United States will establish full diplomatic relations with \nCommunist Vietnam, is a mistake, in my judgment, of \n\n[[Page S 9695]]\nthe highest order. It is not timely yet. Vietnam has not earned \nrecognition.\n  While the U.S. Constitution stipulates that the President is solely \nresponsible for sending and receiving Ambassadors, Congress has the \npower of the purse. I fully support the able majority leader, Mr. Dole, \nand the distinguished Senator from New Hampshire, Mr. Smith, in their \nefforts to exercise that power by withholding funding for this \nnormalization until all American POW's are fully accounted for.\n  Mr. President, Congress has the inescapable responsibility to weigh \nin on this decision if we believe President Clinton is wrong. And I \nbelieve him to be terribly wrong.\n  The President has not yet fulfilled his commitments to resolve the \nPOW/MIA issue. The Vietnamese know much more than they are telling us \nabout the fate of our missing American POW/MIA's. Yet, despite the $100 \nmillion we paid the Vietnamese Government each year to assist our \nGovernment in investigating those POW and MIA cases, the Vietnamese \nstill renege on giving us a full accounting. Until the Vietnamese give \nus the full accounting of all missing American servicemen, it makes no \nsense whatsoever to confer upon them the honor of U.S. recognition.\n  The President insists that normalization of relations will result in \nthe United States\n gaining more access to the Vietnamese Government--the more dialog, he \nargues, the faster they will move toward democracy. The trouble with \nthis spurious argument is that it has been used in Washington to \njustify United States accommodation of Red China--and just take a look \nat where that policy has gotten us.\n\n  The Chinese have certainly moved toward a greater opening of their \neconomy--foreigners can not invest fast enough, and China is taking in \ndollars hand over fist. But what has China sacrificed for all that \nWestern hard currency? Has our policy of engagement persuaded the \nChinese Communists to adopt any democratic reforms whatsoever?\n  No, to the contrary, the Chinese leadership is today more hard line \nand authoritarian than it has been since Mao's Cultural Revolution. \nToday, China is once again rounding up dissidents; they are using \nprison slave labor to create products for export abroad; they are \nexecuting prisoners on demand to sell their organs to wealthy \nforeigners; and they are enforcing a brutal forced abortion policy that \nhas resulted in the mass execution of millions of Chinese children. \nClearly United States recognition and engagement of Red China hasn't \nbought us any influence with the Communist thugs in Beijing. If anyone \ndoubts this, just ask Harry Wu how much the Communist regime there \nvalues our opinion.\n  I think it is a disgrace that, at the same time this administration \nrefuses to support the efforts of Taiwan--a friendly, free market \ndemocracy--to even gain admission to the United Nations, and \npractically had to be forced by Congress to issue a visa to Taiwan's \ndemocratically elected President for a private United States visit, \nthey are enthusiastically conferring full diplomatic recognition on \nVietnam's recalcitrant Communist dictatorship. What kind of message \ndoes that send about our Nation's priorities?\n  If the President insists on going through with the normalization of \nrelations, I can only say this: as chairman of the committee that \nconfirms ambassadorial nominations, it's going to be a tough road to \nconfirmation for nay ambassadorial nominee to Vietnam before the \nVietnamese have accounted for the unresolved POW-MIA cases.\n  As long as Vietnam remains an unrepentant Communist dictatorship, as \nlong as they refuse to provide all information they have about missing \nAmerican servicemen, the United States should not reward their leaders \nby welcoming them into the community of friendly nations.\n  The President's announcement today is just the first step of many. \nThe administration will have to approach Congress to discuss the \nconferral of benefits such as MFN, GSP, or OPIC insurance. Those will \nbe a matter of great debate here in Congress and there is no reason for \nus to move on those until the Vietnamese have earned it. We should take \nthe Vietnamese Government for what it is: a Communist one. It should \ncontinue to be treated as such until it makes true political reform by \nestablishing a legal code and respect for the general human rights of \nall Vietnamese citizens as individuals, rather than merely supporters \nof the State.\n  Vietnam has a long way to go if it wants to reestablish its position \nin the international community. We should not put the cart before the \nhorse and extend them U.S. recognition before they have earned it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DOLE.

Mr. President, on behalf of myself, Senator Levin, Senator \nHatch, Senator Roth, and Senator Johnston, I send an amendment to the \ndesk and ask for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Kansas [Mr. Dole] for himself, Mr. Levin, \n     Mr. Johnston, Mr. Roth, and Mr. Hatch, proposes an amendment \n     numbered 1496 to amendment No. 1487.\n       On page 35, line 10, delete lines 10-13 and insert in lieu \n     thereof: ``(A) Construction with other laws.--The \n     requirements of this section shall supplement, and not \n     supersede, any other decisional criteria otherwise provided \n     by law. Nothing in this section shall be construed to \n     override any statutory requirement, including health, safety, \n     and environmental requirements.''\n\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, let me indicate to my colleagues, because I \nknow a lot of people are wondering about the balance of the evening, we \nare trying to find an additional amendment or two we can bring up \ntonight and have votes on.\n  Again, let me indicate it is not very long to when the August recess \nis supposed to start. We would like to get some of this work done. So I \nthink it is incumbent on all of us, if we can maybe have the Johnston \namendment on thresholds offered and voted on tonight? The $50 to $100 \nmillion?\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Yes. We have that ready. We can put that in.\n  Mr. DOLE. You will do that this evening?\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. We can do that.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I think this amendment will be accepted. Let \nme just say for the record here, there is an effort to try to work \nthese things out on a bipartisan basis. We have had some success in \nthis area. I thank the Senator from Michigan for his cooperation. I \nthink it does answer some of the questions that some have raised, \nlegitimate questions. We have tried to address legitimate questions as \nwe did in the last amendment, though I do not think the amendment was \nnecessary--nor, for that matter, that this one is \n\n[[Page S 9696]]\nnecessary. But if it helps to move the bill along, obviously we are \nprepared to do that.\n  Mr. President, opponents of S. 343, the regulatory reform bill, have \nrepeatedly expressed concern that it would override existing laws \nproviding for protection of health, safety, and the environment. They \nhave made this argument despite the fact that the bill clearly states \nthat its requirements ``supplement and do not supersede'' requirements \nin existing law.\n  They have made this argument despite the fact that every sponsor of \nS. 343 has insisted that its provisions do not override requirements of \nexisting law.\n  It is ironic that this language is similar to language in other \nstatutes, and no one seems to have had difficulty understanding the \nplain meaning of the phrase before. As I stated yesterday, I do not for \n1 minute really believe that Ralph Nader or President Clinton's staff \nare unaware of the language in our bill. But it apparently is \ninconvenient to focus on the facts--that tends to get in the way of \ndemonizing the bill and its supporters.\n  Mr. President, I, and the Senator from Louisiana, Senator Johnston, \nand every other supporter who has spoken has made crystal clear that \nwhat we seek to achieve with this legislation is that cost-benefit \ncriteria are put on an equal footing with requirements of existing law, \nwhere that is permitted by existing law. We do not seek to trump \nhealth, safety, and environmental criteria.\n  Many opponents, in the guise of criticizing what they call a \nsupermandate, really want a supermandate in the opposite direction. \nThat is, they want any perceived conflict between an existing statute \nand considerations of cost resolved in a way that would effectively \ndeprive a cost-benefit analysis of any real meaning. There are times, \nas I have said--and the bill says--that such a result is appropriate. \nBut it cannot be appropriate in all instances. Otherwise, what the \nopponents are really saying is that the tremendous costs to the \nAmerican family--about $6,000 a year--are an irrelevant consideration.\n  Well, I do not think it is an irrelevant consideration to the \nAmerican family. I do not think it is irrelevant to the American small \nor medium-sized business struggling to survive.\n  And it should not be irrelevant to us.\n  So, I reject such an extreme approach. Other opponents however, \ninsist that they want the same thing as we do--that is, a level playing \nfield where considerations of cost are just one part of the agency \ndecisionmaking process, no less and no more important than the \nrequirements of existing law. Where Congress has already spoken and \nstated a policy judgment that considerations of cost are not \nappropriate, that policy judgment would stand. Our regulatory reform \nlegislation does not seek to change that result.\n  For those who have suggested that we seek the same objective, it \nappears that the problem is one of interpreting the current language--\nthey have suggested that it would be more clear to state clearly that \nS. 343 does not override existing laws.\n  In my view, there is no reason not to reemphasize as clearly as \npossible what the bill does not does not do. Therefore, Mr. President, \nI offer an amendment making clear that the requirements of S. 343 are \nnot intended to ``override any express statutory requirements, \nincluding health, safety or environmental requirements.''\n  This is an effort to remove any perceived confusion or murkiness in \nthe former language, and I urge adoption of this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, the majority leader was correct. We have \nchecked on our side of the aisle. We will be glad to accept this \namendment. I do not know whether there will be other amendments to \nperfect this same idea here a little bit further on or not, but I think \nthis is acceptable. I would be glad to accept it on behalf of our side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I think this is just another illustration \nof how we have been trying to work together to try to resolve any \nconflicts on this bill. There have been over a hundred changes in the \nbill that we have done through our negotiations with colleagues on both \nsides of the aisle. We just appreciate the cooperation of Senators on \nboth sides in doing this.\n  We are prepared to accept the amendment as well.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate on the Dole amendment? \nThe Senator from Louisiana.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Mr. President, I would simply like to thank Senator \nLevin, Senator Biden, Senator Glenn, and others who have taken part in \ndebate on this. They have identified the problem in very specific \nterms. This amendment deals fully and completely, in my view, with the \nquestion of the supermandate which is now laid to rest.\n  There is no--N-O, none--super- mandate in this bill. It is \nmade absolutely crystal clear and repeated again in this amendment.\n  I congratulate all concerned for getting it worked out and making it \nclear.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate on the amendment?\n  Mr. LEVIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, many observers and many of us have viewed \nthis bill as having a serious problem, which is raising the possibility \nthat there is an inconsistency between what this bill requires and what \nother laws require.\n  This amendment addresses one part of that issue and it does it, I \nbelieve, in a useful way. That is the reason why the amendment does \nmake a contribution to further progress on the bill.\n  This amendment makes it clear that if, with respect to any action to \nbe taken by a Federal agency, including actions to protect human \nhealth, safety, and the environment, it is not possible for the agency \nto comply with the decisional criteria of this section and the \ndecisional criteria provisions of other law--as interpreted by court \ndecisions--the provisions of this section shall not apply to the \naction.\n  I have expressed my concern about this issue to the sponsors for \nseveral weeks now. I am concerned that there may be situations where \nthe statute which is the basis for the issuance of a regulation may \nconflict or be inconsistent with the requirements of the decisional \ncriteria in section 624. The sponsors say they believe that is not \npossible because of the way section 624 is drafted. I have not shared \ntheir confidence in that belief, but this amendment makes that now \nclear. Where there is an inconsistency or a conflict between the lawful \nrequirements of the statute that is the basis for the regulatory action \nand the requirements of this section, the requirements of the statute \nthat is the basis for the regulatory action govern or control.\n  This amendment ensures that the requirements of the Clean Air Act, \nthe Clean Water Act, the Safe Drinking Water Act, and other important \nenvironmental and health and safety laws are not altered by the \ndecisional criteria contained in section 624. When push comes to shove, \nthe underlying regulatory statutes are primary.\n  I welcome this amendment and think it does improve the bill, but I \nwant to be clear that this is but one problem I have with the \ndecisional criteria provisions of section 624. Other amendments are \nnecessary in order to make this particular section acceptable, and we \nwill be proposing those as the debate on this bill progresses.\n  Mr. President, let me also add on that note that I hope that the \nsponsors of the Dole-Johnston amendment would address the document \nwhich has now been submitted to them as of about 10 days ago, which \nspecifies approximately 9 major issues and 23 smaller issues that a \nnumber of us have with particular language in the Dole-Johnston \nalternative. The Senator from Utah had requested that document when we \nwere involved in discussions on the bill. It has been submitted as of \nabout 10 days ago. I hope there could be a response, because, even \nthough this amendment does address part of one of those issues, there \nare many other issues which I think a bipartisan effort could address \nand make some progress on.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  \n[[Page S 9697]]\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, if I could respond, we are, as far as I am \nconcerned, going to continue ongoing negotiations and keep the door \nopen to do what we can to resolve these problems.\n  On many of the points that were raised, I thought the Senator from \nMichigan was well aware that there are objections to a number of the \nprovisions, on both sides. So we will just keep working together and \nsee what we can do to continue to make headway like we have on this \namendment.\n  If we can continue to do that, we will. And we will certainly \nmention--where we disagree, where we disagree. But we will keep working \nwith the distinguished Senator from Michigan, the Senator from \nMassachusetts, and others who were very concerned about this matter.\n  THE PRESIDING OFFICER. If there be no further debate, the question is \non agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 1496) was agreed to.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. DOLE. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I think if we could now have a time \nagreement on the Johnston amendment, then that would let our Members \nknow how much time they might have between now and the time of the \nvote.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I have been consulting with the \ndistinguished Senator from Louisiana. He is prepared--I will let him \nspeak for himself--but on our side we would be satisfied with a very \nshort timeframe, perhaps a half-hour, 45 minutes.\n  Mr. DOLE. An hour equally divided?\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Mr. President, I would say 30 minutes, really, ought to \ndo it. It is very straightforward. It is just a question of setting the \nthreshold at $100 million.\n  I hope it is not controversial; 30 minutes would suit us fine, \nequally divided.\n  Mr. DOLE. Could we make that 40 minutes equally divided?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, 40 minutes.\n  Mr. DOLE. If there is no objection, when the Senator lays down his \namendment, I ask unanimous consent there be 40 minutes equally divided \non the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the time agreement? \nWithout objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Louisiana.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 1497 to Amendment No. 1487\n\n(Purpose: To revise the threshold for a definition of a ``major rule'' \n      to $100 million, to be adjusted periodically for inflation)\n\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Louisiana [Mr. Johnston] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 1497 to amendment No. 1487.\n\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n       On page 14, line 4, strike out subsection (5)(A) and insert \n     in lieu thereof the following new subsection:\n       ``(A) a rule or set of closely related rules that the \n     agency proposing the rule, the Director, or a designee of the \n     President determines is likely to have a gross annual effect \n     on the economy of $100,000,000 or more in reasonably \n     quantifiable increased costs (and this limit may be adjusted \n     periodically by the Director, at his sole discretion, to \n     account for inflation); or''.\n\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Mr. President, this amendment is very simple.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Will Senators withhold? The Senator from \nLouisiana.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Mr. President, this amendment is very simple. It sets \nthe definition of a major rule at $100 million and gives to the \ndirector, at his sole discretion, the ability to adjust that $100 \nmillion for inflation.\n  Mr. President, $100 million has been the threshold for triggering the \nreview of proposed major rules since the Ford administration. The \neffect over the years has been that $100 million now is much less.\n  Mr. GLENN. Could we have order?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio is correct. Could \nconversations on the floor be removed elsewhere?\n  Would the Senate be in order, in order that debate can be heard?\n  The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Mr. President, the trigger for a major rule \nreevaluation was begun in the Ford administration at $100 million. If \nwe use that same amount today in value, $100 million in the Ford \nadministration would now be worth $252 million, and in the Carter \nadministration it would be $231 million, or in the Reagan \nadministration it would be $154 million. In other words, this is only a \nfraction of the definition we have used since the Ford administration \nfor triggering major rules.\n  The problem here, Mr. President, is simply one of agency overload. We \nare requiring these agencies any time they put out a new rule--and we \nthink there will be probably over 135 major new rules that are in \nprocess right now at the $100 million threshold--they will have to do \ncost-benefit analysis, they will have to do risk assessment with peer \nreview, and judicial review, all of those things for rules which the \nadministration now has in process.\n  In addition to that, they are going to have to go back and review all \nrules which they select for review, all rules that cannot meet the \npresent cost-benefit ratio, the cost-benefit test, and the risk \nassessment test. And the question again is what is a major rule? Is it \n$50 million or is it $100 million? In addition to that, you have a \npetition process so that any person who feels themselves aggrieved by a \npresent rule will be able to petition to have that put on the schedule \nfor review. It is an enormous amount of work.\n  So what we want to do is set this limit at $100 million for a major \nrule rather than at $50 million hopefully to make the amount of work to \nbe done manageable. We do not want to kill these agencies with so much \nkindness or so much work that they are not able to do anything. What \nindustry wants is to be able to get some of these rules that are \nburdensome and adopted without science and adopted without proper \nprocedures. They want to get them reviewed. If you allow for a review \nof any rule at $50 million as opposed to $100 million, it may so \noverburden the agencies that they cannot do anything, that you will \nhave gridlock, that you will not be able to do whatever one wants to do \nand which is to have good risk assessment, good cost-benefit analysis, \ngood science brought into rulemaking. It is a very straightforward \namendment. It simply ups it to $100 million.\n  I hope my colleagues are willing to accept this amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President I support the current amendment to raise the \ndollar threshold for major rules from $50 to $100 million. I support \nthis amendment because it would help ensure that this bill will work \nfor us, not against us.\n  The purpose of S. 343 is to ensure better, more rational regulations \nand to reduce the regulatory burden while still ensuring that important \nbenefits are provided. S. 343 aims to restrain regulators from issuing \nill-conceived regulations. It requires better analysis of costs, \nbenefits, and risks, so that regulators will issue smarter, more cost-\neffective regulations. This is common sense reform, not rollback. We \nwant agencies to work for the public's best interests, not against \nthem.\n  But we cannot so overburden the agencies with analytical requirements \nthat they cannot properly carry out their mission to serve the public. \nThat is why we need a dollar threshold before requiring regulators to \nsubject rules to detailed analysis--cost-benefit analysis and risk \nassessment. Costly rules, of course, merit detailed analysis. But less \ncostly rules do not. The reason is simple. Cost-benefit analysis and \nrisk assessment are themselves costly and time-consuming.\n  This is why, since cost-benefit analysis was first required by \nPresident Ford over 20 years ago, it only applied to major rules \ncosting over $100 million. Every President since then, including \nPresidents Carter, Reagan, Bush, and Clinton, have used the $100 \nmillion threshold for required cost-benefit analysis. This same \nthreshold had strong precedent in the Senate. S. 1080, supported by a \nvote of 94 to 0 in 1982, \n\n[[Page S 9698]]\nhad a $100 million threshold. In addition, S. 291, the Regulatory \nReform Act of 1995, which I introduced in January and which received \nthe unanimous support of the Governmental Affairs Committee, had a $100 \nmillion threshold. We also should keep in mind that the current value \nof this $100 million threshold, set in 1974, is actually far less than \n$50 million in 1974 dollars.\n  A $100 million threshold makes sense because those costly rules \naccount for about 85 percent of all regulatory costs. Yet, there are a \nlimited number of such rules--about 130 rules per year for \nnonindependent agencies.\n  This means that the vast bulk of the regulatory burden can be put \nunder control with a roughly predictable, and more importantly, \nmanageable analytical burden. There is no good reason to have a lower \ndollar threshold for major rules. A $50 million threshold would sweep \nin many more rules but make it all the more difficult for the agencies \nto handle the analytical burden. We just do not really know how many \nnew rules a $50 million threshold would capture.\n  Even more troubling to me have been recent attempts to further burden \nthe agencies--which would already be pressed hard by the requirements \nof S. 343--with more analytical requirements beyond those of the $50 \nmillion threshold. The recent Nunn-Coverdell amendment, for example, \nwill dramatically increase the burdens imposed by S. 343. It would \nsweep into the definition of major rule all rules that have a \nsignificant impact on a substantial number of small businesses, as \ndefined by the Regulatory Flexibility Act. This could add many hundreds \nof additional rules, including some very small rules, to the cost-\nbenefit and petition process of S. 343. I am deeply concerned about the \nburdens imposed on small business. But the Nunn-Coverdell amendment \nthreatens to sink an already heavily loaded ship.\n  Raising the major rule threshold to $100 million is not enough to \ncure the overload problem confronting S. 343, but it will help to \nlighten the load. It will help make this bill a more workable and more \neffective bill for the American public. It is good government. I urge \nmy colleagues on both sides of the aisle to support this important \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who seeks recognition?\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I yield 2 minutes to the distinguished \nSenator from Texas.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. President, I would like to yield 2 minutes to the Senator from \nGeorgia.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah controls the time.\n  Mr. HATCH. I am obviously happy to yield 3 minutes to the \ndistinguished Senator from Georgia.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the amendment. \nI spent the better part of yesterday arguing the unique problems that \nsmall businesses have in our country. The vast majority of businesses \nin America are small. Ninety-four percent of the 5 million-plus \nbusinesses in America have 50 employees or less.\n  By elevating the threshold, I recognize that we still have the \namendment that we adopted yesterday that would take rules that get \nswept under reg-flex, but nevertheless the broader application of the \nbill's threshold is being elevated by moving from $50 to $100 million \nand reducing the size of the sweep, and I think it is moving in the \nwrong direction.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Mr. President, will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. COVERDELL. I yield.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Actually, rules that affect small businesses--how many \ndid we say there were, how many million in this country?\n  Mr. COVERDELL. About 5 million.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. About 5 million. When they affect small business, they \nare likely to be a major rule. But we have that provided for in the \nCoverdell amendment of yesterday with the reg-flex, and I believe that \nsolves that problem. What we do not want to do is get agency overload \nhere so that those rules which are burdensome to small businesses would \nnot then be able to get--you would not have time to get your petition \ndone because the agency would be so overloaded with other rules. I \nsuggest to my friend that going to $100 million is not going to be \ndifficult for small business because you have already protected them \nunder the Coverdell amendment, and they are likely to be $100 million \nrules if they have broad application to small business, in any event.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. In the time I have remaining, I would like to respond. \nI understand the point my good colleague from Louisiana is trying to \nmake, and I do appreciate the work that the Senator has expended for \nmany years, including this particular debate. It has been a major \ncontribution to the country, and I commend the Senator for it.\n  I only assert that it is a move in the wrong direction. I agree that \nthe amendment we adopted yesterday is a step in the right direction \nbecause it will sweep those rules that are affected by reg-flex into \nour system. But there can be no argument that by moving from a $50 \nmillion threshold to a $100 million threshold, we are removing \nprotection from a class of businesses, and they will generally be \nsmaller businesses that are affected by the full ramifications of the \nbill and not just reg-flex. And let me say, as I said yesterday, Mr. \nPresident, that if I am confronted with the issue of who suffers the \noverload or the burden, and the argument is between small businesses or \nmedium-sized businesses or huge, mega agencies, Mr. President, I side \non the equation of helping businesses that have been suffering and the \nramifications that come from that suffering and not on the side of \nthese huge agencies with millions and billions of dollars and \nattorneys, so many that you cannot even name them. We should be moving \nin the direction of protecting the people on Main Street America and \nnot on being overly concerned about the burdens these big agencies \nface.\n  Mr. President, I yield back whatever time is left.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator from Utah yield to the \nSenator from Texas?\n  Mr. HATCH. I yield to the distinguished Senator from Texas.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I would like to just address a \nquestion to the Senator from Georgia on my time, and that is I wonder \nif we have even talked about the impact on other governments of Federal \nregulations, such as our small towns across America. Our small towns \nare reeling from regulations that require them to go into their water \nsupply and test for items that do not even relate to their part of the \ncountry. I just wanted to ask the Senator from Georgia if he does not \nthink that the lower threshold is also going to be a boon to the \nsmaller towns that might not have the ability to have legal staffs that \ncan come up and talk to Federal agencies?\n  Mr. COVERDELL. The Senator from Texas is exactly right. In fact, she \nadmonishes me in a way, because yesterday in talking about the reg-\nflex, or the small businesses, I did not talk enough about small cities \nand towns, small government jurisdictions and nonprofits. And as I said \nin my earlier remarks, this is just moving in the wrong direction. This \nis removing these smaller jurisdictions, smaller businesses from the \nsweep of the intent of this bill. I do not think it devastates the \nbill, but it is moving in the wrong direction.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I, like my colleague from Georgia, \nappreciate what the Senator from Louisiana has done in this bill. He \nhas worked to try to make it a good bill. But I am concerned if we \nraise the threshold that there might be people in that $50 to $100 \nmillion category--cities, towns, maybe counties, maybe school districts \nor water districts, some of our smaller entities--that really might not \nhave the protection of the good science, of the peer review, the \nability to have cost-benefit analysis and risk analysis.\n  I think what this bill does is so important to provide the basis upon \nwhich people will know out in the open what the effects of these \nregulations are, and it will have the effect, of course, of making the \nregulators think very carefully before they do these regulations.\n  Passing this bill in itself is going to have an effect on regulators \nin making \n\n[[Page S 9699]]\nsure that they know exactly what they are doing as they affect the \nsmall businesses of our country or, indeed, the local taxpayers of our \ncountry.\n  So I join with my colleagues in saying that I think it is very \nimportant that we not leave that $50 to $100 million range. In fact, I \nhave to say if it were my choice, I would not have a range at all that \nwas a floor. I would have from zero because I think no matter what the \nregulation is, if it affects your business or your small town or your \nwater district, this is going to make a difference in the way you are \nable to provide jobs or serve your taxpayers.\n  So I do not think we should have any range that is excluded, but \ncertainly I think the higher range is going to provide hardship for \npeople who probably do not have the legal staffs to really have their \nviewpoints known as well as the people in the larger categories.\n  So I respectfully argue against this amendment as well, and hope that \nour colleagues will not have that group in the $50 to $100 million \ncategory that might not be covered by sound science, science in the \nsunshine, cost-benefit analysis, or risk analysis. And if it is a \nburden on the large agencies, then perhaps we will have the effect of \nfewer, more important, good regulations rather than so many regulations \nthat do cause a hardship on our smaller entities.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Mr. President, I very much appreciate the contribution \nthat the Senator from Texas has made to this effort, and I share with \nher completely her concern about small businesses and small towns and \ncounties. I have been in towns in Louisiana which have been subjected \nto some of these incredible regulations that would fine them for doing \nthings which just went contrary to common sense. I would sit there with \nthe mayors of these various towns and wring my hands with them because \nit was so outrageous sometimes what these regulations provided. \nHowever, going from $50 to $100 million does not hurt the small towns \nor small businesses. It is not that by going down you exempt the \nsmaller people.\n Rather, you make it possible or feasible for small counties, small \ntowns, small businesses to have their regulations considered at all. In \nother words, the problem here is agency overload.\n  I have met at some length with Sally Katzen, the head of OIRA. She \nsaid\n\n       You know, one of our problems here is peers. We have peer \n     review, but how can we find enough peers to review hundreds \n     and hundreds of regulations and have cost-benefit ratios and \n     risk assessments, scientific determinations for these \n     hundreds of rules which are going to be simultaneously \n     reviewed?\n\n  And to do so by the way, in light of a budget which is now being cut \nin the appropriations process as we speak. It is going to be a \nformidable process.\n  So, I think that the best way to get this done is to go in the \ndirection of where we started in the Ford administration that major \nrules defined in the Ford administration is $100 million. And, you \nknow, that amounts to $300 million something--$252 million. So we have \nbeen coming down in that through the years.\n  I hope my colleagues will recognize this problem of overload. Look, \nif we are not overloaded on this process in a year or two the Senator \ncan propose and I think the Senate would enact a lower threshold. I \nsuspect what we are going to find is that we may be considering an \nupping of the threshold rather than a lowering of it simply because of \nthe question of legislative overload. Really, if we can get this $100 \nmillion, I think it makes a better and more workable bill, one that \nwill protect our small towns and counties and our small businesses. And \nI hope my colleagues will allow it to be done.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. HATCH. I will yield to the Senator.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I would just like to respond briefly \nand say that I think it is a matter of where you err. And while the \namendment of the Senator from Louisiana would err perhaps by saying \nthat we could always lower the threshold if we found that we needed to \nbecause so many people were exempt, I would err the other way. I would \nsay, let us set it at $50 million and make sure that every regulation \nthat we can possibly make well thought out and well documented is, in \nfact, well thought out and well documented. And if we have to raise the \nthreshold later I would rather have to do that than to have to come in \nand try to lower it because so many people are harassed with \nregulations that did not have the scientific basis and the risk \nanalysis and the cost-benefit analysis.\n  So I think it is a matter of do we err on the side of doing too much \nor do we err on the side of doing too little? I would rather protect \nthe people, the small business people of this country, the small towns \nof this country, the small water districts of this country, and then if \nit becomes an onerous burden on the Federal agencies I am sure we will \nhear about that and we can always up the threshold. But I want to make \nsure that every regulation that we can possibly make be well thought \nout, well documented in science, have a cost-benefit analysis, and in \nfact does have those criteria.\n  So, I do appreciate the position of the Senator from Louisiana. But I \njust think it is more important for us to err on the side of caution \nand protection of our small business people and our small towns than \nthe opposite, so that people are in a threshold of $50 million than the \n$100 million and they do not have those well-thought-out regulations.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Mr. President, just very briefly. The reg-flex \namendment which we adopted yesterday which was designed to take care of \nsmall business includes in its definition of small entity, small \ngovernmental jurisdiction, which goes on to mean government, cities, \ntowns, townships, villages, school districts, special districts, with a \npopulation of less than 50,000, unless an agency establishes another \namount. So we took care really in the reg-flex amendment of yesterday, \nI believe, of the concerns about small towns and cities. And frankly I \nhad not realized that that definition was in reg-flex. But I believe \nthat covers the Senator's concern for small towns and jurisdictions.\n  Mr. HATCH addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. How much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah has 9 minutes and 20 \nseconds remaining.\n  Mr. HATCH. How much on the other side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Six minutes and 32 seconds on the other side.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I am not sure from the discussion of the \ndistinguished Senator from Louisiana that is so, because as I recall \nthe Coverdell amendment just mentioned entities of small businesses. \nBut we will check on it. Be that as it may, the House has listed a \nthreshold of $25 million. The threshold in this bill is $50 million. I \nask the Senator, am I not wrong on that?\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. This bill is $50 million.\n  Mr. HATCH. This particular bill's threshold is $50 million. And I \nhave to say that all of small business throughout this country is \nwatching this particular vote. It is going to be the vote on small \nbusiness, as was the Nunn-Coverdell amendment. I understand the \narguments on both sides. But frankly, with the House at $25 million, us \nat $50 million, there seems little or no real justification for the \n$100 million. So I support the $50 million threshold in Dole-Johnston-\nHatch.\n  This is a small business measure. The whole purpose of fighting this \nout on the floor is to try and do it for small business people. The \nissue here is whether or not small businesses are going to be treated \nthe same as larger businesses. The reg-flex act may not cover all rules \nthat affect small businesses. As you know, the standards in that act \nwere adopted by the Coverdell amendment. And that amendment may not \ncover all situations affecting small business, or at least I have been \nled to believe that is the case. And I still have some concerns whether \nsmall towns are covered by that amendment, individuals, small \nnonbusiness associations, charities. Those are all not covered by the \nCoverdell amendment. And should they not be protected by S. 343? And by \nthis regulatory reform bill? I think that is what we come down to. \n\n[[Page S 9700]]\n\n  I would prefer to keep the threshold at $50 million. I am not going \nto go and weep in the corner if this amendment goes down in defeat. But \nI have to say--I mean, if the amendment is adopted which the \ndistinguished Senator from Louisiana is advocating, and I understand \nhis reasons for doing so. But I believe that small business and \nindividuals, small towns and cities, nonprofit corporations, I might \nadd, nonbusiness associations, do deserve the protection and the care \nthat a $50 million threshold would give. With that, I am really \nprepared to yield back any time we have, or I yield the floor. And I \nreserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Mr. President, I would be prepared to yield back the \nbalance of my time. Can we have a vote at this time?\n  Mr. HATCH. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Will the Senator withhold? As long as we have got to \nwait for this, let me say that, Mr. President, this amendment is viewed \nvery, very seriously by an awful lot of people on our side and by the \nadministration based on this question of agency overload. I really \nbelieve, as someone who has been involved in this risk assessment now \nfrom the very start, that this is a very legitimate concern of the \nadministration. The American Bar Association gives this question of the \ndefinition of ``major rule''--it is the very first and most important \ncriticism they have of S. 343. It is the most important criticism, or \none of the most important, of the administration, one of the most \nimportant concerns over here.\n  Now, Mr. President, we very much need to pass this legislation. I \nhope my colleagues on the other side of the aisle will give us enough \nvotes to let us pass it. This is one of those important amendments that \ndoes not in any way derogate from the importance and the central value \nof risk assessment, cost-benefit analysis.\n But it may have a lot to do with making it workable. I mean, the \nAmerican Bar Association is not out to do in small businesses or small \ncommunities in our country. They are simply aware, as they say, it will \nsweep too broadly and, therefore, dilute the ultimate impact of the \nbill.\n\n  Quoting from the American Bar Association:\n\n       This change is crucial for Association support.\n\n  That is, American Bar Association support.\n  We can pass a bill without the American Bar Association support, I \nunderstand that. But they are enthusiastic supporters of the concept, \nas I am the person who first proposed risk assessment here on the \nfloor, but we have to make it workable. To go up to $100 million simply \nmakes this more workable, Mr. President. Nothing could be worse than to \nhave this vast plethora of regulations all of a sudden dumped on \nagencies unable to contend with them, unable to find the peer review, \nunable to have budgets that will cover the cost of cost-benefit, unable \nto hire the scientists to do the studies to do the risk assessment, and \notherwise unable to meet deadlines. That is a formula for chaos. That \nis why the American Bar Association thinks we ought to go to $100 \nmillion. That is why the administration thinks so, and that is why I \nthink so.\n  So, Mr. President, this amendment will help pass--not only help pass \nand get signed into law--this legislation; it will make it workable. \nEverybody wants this legislation to work when and if we pass it, and I \nbelieve we are going to be able to pass it, because I think the spirit \nof the floor, and of the proponents, certainly the majority leader, \nSenator Hatch and others, has been to accommodate reasonable criticisms \nin the present draft of S. 343. I really believe that is true. I think \nthe acceptance of that last amendment showed that kind of spirit, and I \nhope we can get that kind of spirit on this $100 million amendment. \nThis is really a crucial amendment, as the American Bar Association has \nsaid, as the administration has said.\n  I have not gone along with all of the administration's criticisms of \nthis bill. As a matter of fact, I have not gone along with most of the \nadministration's criticisms of this bill. I think some of it may be \nprevious versions that they are criticizing. I think some of it may be \na fictitious bill that has never been offered and is not now on the \nfloor that they are criticizing. But, Mr. President, this $100 million \ncriticism--that is, the criticism of the $50 million being too low and \nthe desire to go to $100 million--is right on target. It is what it \ntakes to make this bill workable.\n  I beseech and implore my colleagues to let us get this limit to $100 \nmillion where the bill can be allowed to work.\n  Mr. President, if none of my colleagues has further debate, I suggest \nthe absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. HATCH. I yield such time as the distinguished Senator may need.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Utah.\n  I wanted to answer one point of the Senator from Louisiana on his \namendment, and that is the point that the small entities would be \ncovered under the reg-flex amendment that we adopted yesterday. In \nfact, the reg-flex amendment covers cost-benefit analysis, but there \nare many small entities that would not get the risk analysis that is \ncovered by this bill, and these are the entities that would be lost \nbetween the $50 million and $100 million threshold.\n  So it is very important to the small towns and the water districts \nand the small businesses that they have the availability of risk \nanalysis for sound, good regulatory bases, just as the larger entities \nwould, and perhaps they need it even more because they do not have the \nlegal staffs that are available in the upper echelons.\n  I did want to make that one point so that it was clear that we need \nrisk analysis and the sound basis that risk analysis would provide for \nthe $50 to $100 million category that would be left out if we adopt \nthis amendment.\n  Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays on the \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second.\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If there is no further debate, the question is \non agreeing to the amendment.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. LOTT. I announce that the Senator from Missouri [Mr. Bond] and \nthe Senator from Arizona [Mr. McCain] are necessarily absent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. DeWine). Are there any other Senators in \nthe Chamber desiring to vote?\n  The result was announced--yeas 53, nays 45, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 300 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--53\n\n     Akaka\n     Baucus\n     Biden\n     Bingaman\n     Boxer\n     Bradley\n     Breaux\n     Bryan\n     Bumpers\n     Byrd\n     Chafee\n     Cohen\n     Conrad\n     Daschle\n     Dodd\n     Dorgan\n     Exon\n     Feingold\n     Feinstein\n     Ford\n     Glenn\n     Graham\n     Harkin\n     Hatfield\n     Heflin\n     Hollings\n     Inouye\n     Jeffords\n     Johnston\n     Kennedy\n     Kerrey\n     Kerry\n     Kohl\n     Lautenberg\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Lieberman\n     Mikulski\n     Moseley-Braun\n     Moynihan\n     Murray\n     Nunn\n     Pell\n     Pryor\n     Reid\n     Robb\n     Rockefeller\n     Roth\n     Sarbanes\n     Simon\n     Snowe\n     Specter\n     Wellstone\n\n                                NAYS--45\n\n     Abraham\n     Ashcroft\n     Bennett\n     Brown\n     Burns\n     Campbell\n     Coats\n     Cochran\n     Coverdell\n     Craig\n     D'Amato\n     DeWine \n\n[[Page S 9701]]\n\n     Dole\n     Domenici\n     Faircloth\n     Frist\n     Gorton\n     Gramm\n     Grams\n     Grassley\n     Gregg\n     Hatch\n     Helms\n     Hutchison\n     Inhofe\n     Kassebaum\n     Kempthorne\n     Kyl\n     Lott\n     Lugar\n     Mack\n     McConnell\n     Murkowski\n     Nickles\n     Packwood\n     Pressler\n     Santorum\n     Shelby\n     Simpson\n     Smith\n     Stevens\n     Thomas\n     Thompson\n     Thurmond\n     Warner\n\n                             NOT VOTING--2\n\n     Bond\n     McCain\n       \n  So the amendment (No. 1497) was agreed to.\n  Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I want to make an inquiry now if there are \nany amendments on either side that can be offered so we can have \nanother vote or two this evening?\n  As I understand, the Senator from Ohio indicates there are no \namendments on that side.\n  Mr. GLENN. No amendments.\n  Mr. DOLE. We are looking at one from the distinguished minority \nleader. We have not had a chance to review that yet.\n  Mr. GLENN. That is correct. We thought there would be one, but you \nare looking at it. We will have another one ready in the morning.\n  Mr. DOLE. Does that mean you are about to run out?\n  Mr. GLENN. I would not say that exactly at this point.\n  Mr. DOLE. Are there any at this point?\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Mr. President, if the majority leader will yield, I \nwonder if the majority leader would entertain an amendment at this \npoint to make the bill not applicable to any notice of proposed \nrulemaking which would commence on July 1, 1995, or earlier? In other \nwords, those on-going regulations which would still be subject to the \npetition process, so you would not have to go back and redo and replow \nall that same ground.\n  Do you want time to think about that?\n  Mr. HATCH. I think we need some time to think about that because we \nneed to know what all the rules are that will be affected by it. But we \nwill certainly look at that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. DOLE. If there are no----\n  Mr. GLENN. Will the majority leader yield? One point I would like to \nmake, on June 28 we gave a list of 9 major concerns we had and 23 minor \nones. We were told at that time that your side would get back to us as \nfast as possible.\n  We have been working through one or two--or a few of these things \nhere today, but we have not had any answer to this. We were told that \nwould be addressed. This is our blueprint for what we thought would \nmake the thing acceptable. Until we can get back an answer to some of \nthese things, I think it is going to be difficult to move ahead too \nfast.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, may I respond to the distinguished Senator? \nWe have looked at that and we understand there are people on his side \nthat do not like some of those suggestions. There are certainly a lot \nof people on our side. So what we have been trying to do is work out \nindividual items as we can. But the vast bulk of those, we have had \nobjections on one side or the other or both.\n  So, we will just keep working together with those who have submitted \nthose to us, and see what we can do. We have made some headway almost \neach and every day that we have been debating this matter.\n  So, all I can do is pledge to keep working at it and see what can be \ndone. But there are an awful lot of those suggestions that are not \ngoing to be acceptable.\n  Mr. DOLE. As I understand it, one of the nine dealt with an amendment \nwe just disposed of.\n  Mr. GLENN. That is what I just said.\n  Mr. DOLE. There is some progress being made there, but I think it is \nfair to say there will be no more votes tonight.\n  Mr. GLENN. I would like to address this again. What we thought we \nwere going to have is an answer to this whole package. That was the way \nit was originally presented. I know we dealt with a couple of these \nitems here, but we would much prefer to see how many of these things we \ncould get through as a package. If we could get an answer on some of \nthese things, that will certainly help.\n  Mr. DOLE. Let me yield to the Senator from Utah to respond.\n  Mr. HATCH. I would have to say again, I thought the other side was \naware of the matters that we felt we could work on and the matters we \nfelt we could not, that there could be no agreement on. But we will \nendeavor to try to outline each and every item on that. But we are \nworking with the other side. We are trying to accommodate. Today I \nthink is good evidence of that.\n  We will work on it and try to get back on each and every item.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, as I understand it, there will be no further \namendments offered but there will be debate on the bill. I think there \nare a number of colleagues on either side who wish to make statements \non the bill. Hopefully, we can find some amendment that can be offered, \nlaid down early in the morning, so we can get an early start.\n  Maybe in the meantime we can address some of the questions raised by \nthe Senator from Ohio and get some response so we can move on. We would \nlike to finish this bill tomorrow night if we could. Which we cannot.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I rise to comment on the regulatory \nreform bill, S. 343, that has occupied the attention of the Senate \nthroughout the day. I watched a good portion of the debate from my \noffice, on television, and occasionally here on the floor. I have been \ninterested in my senior colleague from Utah and his list of the top 10 \nhorror stories of regulatory excess. I have been unable to gather as \nmany as 10. My resources are perhaps not as good as my colleague's, but \nI want to add another to the horror stories of regulatory excess from \nthe State of Utah, and perhaps spend a little more time on this one \nthan the list that my senior colleague went through earlier.\n  I am talking about a business called Rocky Mountain Fabrication, \nwhich is located in Salt Lake City, UT. It has been operating at a site \nin industrial north Salt Lake since the early 1980's. It needs to \nexpand its operations to meet the demands of an improving economy. \nRocky Mountain employs about 150 people.\n  Its business is steel fabrication which requires the use of an \noutdoor yard. They have to lay out large pieces of steel that are then \nmoved by heavy equipment. Negotiations between Rocky Mountain and EPA \nhave been going on since 1990, nearly 5 years. They have cost the \ncompany $100,000 in legal fees and other fees connected with this \nfight. At the moment, a conclusion is no closer than it was when it \nstarted. There is no resolution in sight.\n  Here are the facts. Rocky Mountain Fabrication acquired its 5-acre \nsite in 1981 and developed approximately 3 acres of the site. At the \ntime, all the land was dry. If you have been to Utah, you know that is \nthe normal pattern of land in Utah. It is part of the great American \ndesert. In 1983, we had unusual flooding in Utah. There was a \ncombination of a bigger than normal snow pack, a late spring. It stayed \nin the mountains in snow, and then suddenly a very rapid drop; a rise \nin temperature, and immediate thawing of all the snow, and we had \nrunoff.\n  You may recall, Mr. President, and some others may recall, that we \nhad literally a river running down the principal street of downtown \nSalt Lake with sandbags on either side to keep damage out of the \nbusiness stores. That happened in 1983.\n  If you are following the EPA, you know what is going to happen next. \nAll of a sudden, this dry land on which Rocky Mountain Fabrication had \nbeen carrying on their business became a wetland because of the unusual \nnature of this spring runoff. It kept happening. In 1985-86, EPA began \ninvestigating the site. In 1990, they got serious with their \ninvestigation.\n  Approximately 1.3 acres of Rocky Mountain's property was filled. Oh, \nyou cannot do that. You cannot take steps \n\n[[Page S 9702]]\nto change the nature of your own property under Federal regulations. \nRocky Mountain provided numerous proposals, technical studies, and \nother information to EPA to resolve this matter so that it can expand \nits business. These proposals included removing over half of the 1.3 \nacres filled together with mitigation in the form of a monetary \ndonation to significant off-site projects around the Great Salt Lake, \nor enhancement of 30 to 50 acres of wetlands along the Great Salt Lake.\n  All of these proposals have been rejected by the EPA. Instead, the \nagency has demanded that Rocky Mountain remove 2.9 acres from its 5-\nacre site, which would far exceed the amount filled in 1985-86, \neffectively rendering the property unusable and putting the company out \nof business at its present location.\n  In response to Rocky Mountain's proposal to provide compensatory \nmitigation through a financial contribution to the $3.5 million offset \nwetland enhancement project contemplated by the Audubon Society around \nthe Great Salt Lake, EPA officials verbally responded that any such \nproposal would require Rocky Mountain to contribute the entire $3.5 \nmillion cost of the project. Only that would be acceptable.\n  Well, $3.5 million for 1.3 acres in industrial north Salt Lake? Boy, \nI would love to be the landlord that got that kind of a price for \nselling that sort of land. It is unbelievable. But this is the best EPA \ncan do after costs of over $100,000 to the citizen who did nothing \nbeyond working on his own land for 5 years.\n  Mr. President, this is an example--we have had many of them here on \nthis floor--of this kind of regulatory overkill.\n  I believe in this bill. I intend to vote for this bill, and I urge \nall of my colleagues to vote for this bill.\n  This bill will not get at the core of the problem. I hope it is a \ngood first step towards the core of the problem, but it will not get at \nthe core of the problem. The core of the problem, Mr. President, is \nthis, as more and more regulators themselves are discovering: It has to \ndo with the cultural attitude of a regulatory agency.\n  I ran a business. I know how important culture is to a business. The \nmost important culture you can establish in a business is this one: The \ncustomer comes first. We exist to serve the customer. Whatever the \ncustomer asks for, whatever the customer needs, we will do everything \nwe can to provide it. If you can get that culture in the minds of your \nemployees and maintain it by the way you run your business, you are \nalmost certain to have a successful business. In a regulatory agency, \nthe culture is: The customer is lying; or, The customer is cheating; \nor, The customer must have done something wrong or I would not be here \nin this agency.\n  I have never dealt with a regulatory agency who came in with the \nnotion: ``I am going to conduct an investigation, and I accept as one \nof the possibilities the possibility that you have not done anything \nwrong.'' No, that is not in the regulatory culture.\n  If we could get that notion in the culture of regulatory agencies, \nthat alone would take care of most of these horror stories, if the \nperson doing the regulating were to say, ``OK, somebody is complaining. \nSomeone has suggested there is something wrong here. But I am here to \nfind out the facts. That is the culture of my regulatory agency, and I \ncome in with the understanding that you may not have done anything \nwrong. I am here to find out the facts.''\n  I do not know how we pass legislation to change culture in an agency. \nI do not know how we accomplish this goal. But I do know that we do not \nget the goal accomplished if we do not start talking about it.\n  So that is why I have decided to add to this horror story that \nparticular conversation. I intend, Mr. President, whenever a regulatory \nagency comes before any subcommittee on the Appropriations Committee on \nwhich I sit to raise this issue with them. What is the culture in your \nagency? Is it a culture of let us go find the facts, or is it a culture \nof if I am here, there must be something wrong?\n  Indeed, some agencies are afraid to come back from an investigation \nand say, ``There was nothing wrong,'' for fear the culture in the \nmanagement of the agency will say, ``Well, if you could not find \nanything wrong with that circumstance, there must be something wrong \nwith you as an investigator. Now go back and find something that you \ncan fine them for. Find something you can attack them for.''\n  In that kind of a culture, of course, you get the sense of us versus \nthem that seems to dominate the regulatory field in this country.\n  So, Mr. President, as I say, I intend to vote for this bill. I urge \nall of my colleagues to vote for this bill. I raise horror stories like \nthe one that I have recited, but I think the long-term solution with \nwhich all of us must be concerned must be geared at changing the \ncorporate culture, if you will, in regulatory agencies and getting \npeople who are working for the Government to begin to understand that \ntaxpayers must be treated like customers. There must be a presumption \nthat the taxpayer, that the individual citizen, that the person being \ninvestigated may just be completely innocent of any wrongdoing. That \npossibility must be clearly in the minds of regulators when they go \nout. They must not be punished if they find that that is, indeed, the \ncase. If they come back and say, ``We have conducted this \ninvestigation, and this company, this individual, we discovered has \ndone nothing wrong,'' there must be no cultural opprobrium attached to \nthat result on the part of the management of the regulatory agency. \nThat is the most ephemeral kind of change, the most subtle kind of \nchange, the one most difficult to accomplish but ultimately the one \nthat must take place.\n  Mr. President, S. 343 will not accomplish that. We need a lot more \nconversation and a lot more change of attitudes throughout the entire \nFederal establishment to accomplish that. But S. 343 will at least send \na message throughout the Federal establishment that we here in the \nCongress are aware of the need for those kinds of changes and we are \nwilling to pass legislation that will move in that direction. It is for \nthat reason I support the legislation and urge its passage.\n  Mr. INHOFE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n\n\n                   Announcement of Position on Votes\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. I have two announcements. First, I announce that, if I \nhad been present and voting yesterday on rollcall vote No. 297 to this \nbill, I would have voted ``yea.'' Second, if present and voting on vote \nNo. 298, I would have voted ``yea.''\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Record will so reflect.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, what we have been talking about today is a \nvery significant thing. It is something that we are concerned about to \nthe extent that those of us who ran for reelection last time can tell \nyou that this is on the minds of the American people, not just large \nand small businesses but individuals as well. This issue is probably \nthe most critical issue to come before the Congress in the minds of the \nAmerican public. It will redesign the regulatory process of the Federal \nGovernment.\n  One of the distinctions, for those of us who have served in both \nbodies, that is most noticeable is that over here on this side you only \nrun every 6 years. The drawback to that is you sometimes lose contact \nwith what people are thinking. For those of us who went through an \nelection, Mr. President, this last time, I can assure you there are two \nmandates that went with that election which have to be ranked No. 1 and \nNo. 2, and I am not sure in which order they would be.\n  One, of course, is doing something about the deficit, and the other \nis doing something about the abusive bureaucracy and the overregulation \nthat we find in our lives. I have had this fortified since the election \nin that I have had 77 townhall meetings since January, and it always \ncomes up.\n  The Senator from Utah was talking about the horror stories. Let me \nassure you there are a lot of horror stories. We have heard a lot \ntoday, and we will have heard a lot more. But I have categorized about \nsix things that have come out of these townhall meetings which were \nprominent in the minds of Americans during the last elections.\n  They are: First, the American public wants a smaller Federal \nGovernment. Second, the public demands fewer Government regulations. \nThird, people \n\n[[Page S 9703]]\nwant regulations that are cost effective. Fourth, they want Federal \nbureaucracies to quit invading their lives. Fifth, small businesses \nneed regulatory relief to survive and create jobs. Sixth, people want \nthe Government to use common sense in developing new regulations.\n  When debating and discussing this issue, most people focus on the \ndirect cost of regulations on businesses and on the general public, \nwhich is enormous. Over $6,000 is the cost each year for each American \nfamily because of the cost of regulation. For each senseless and \nburdensome regulation, we have Government bureaucracies and agencies \nproposing, writing, enacting, and enforcing these needless regulations, \nand this actually drives up the national debt.\n  This is something that has not been discussed, and I wish to give \ncredit to a professor from Clemson University, Prof. Bruce Yandle, who \nmade quite a discovery. He discovered that there is a direct \nrelationship between the deficit each year and the number of \nregulations.\n  Our Federal Register is the document in which we find the listing of \nthe regulations. The discovery that Professor Yandle made is portrayed \non this chart. This is kind of interesting because the red line \ndesignates the number of pages in the Federal Register. In other words, \nwe are talking about the red line which goes up like this. And this out \nhere is the peak of the Carter administration when we were trying to \nget as many regulations on the books before they changed guard after \nRonald Reagan was the designee for President of the United States.\n  Now, the yellow columns here designate in billions of dollars the \nFederal deficit for that given year. Now, look at this; it is really \nremarkable. You have this line that is trailing this line going across \nalmost exactly at the same rate. In other words, in those years when we \nhave a higher Federal deficit, we also have more pages of regulations.\n  And so I would contend to you that the best way we can address the \ndeficit problem is to do something about the overregulation, do \nsomething to cut down the number of regulations in our society.\n  The bill under consideration today, the Comprehensive Regulatory \nReform Act of 1995, will go a long way to meeting the concerns of the \nAmerican public on needless and burdensome Federal regulations. And, as \nthe Senator from Utah said, I would like to have this bill stronger. I \nthink it should be stronger. But this is a compromise bill. This is one \nthat many people on the other side of the aisle who really do not feel \nwe are overburdened with regulation think is probably a good \ncompromise. I would prefer to have it stronger, but it is a compromise, \nand it is the best we could hope for now.\n  I would like to outline a few of the key components of the bill, \nbecause I think we have kind of lost track of what it actually does, \nand then give some examples of the types of regulations that we are \nexposed to. As the Senator from Utah, I spent 35 years of my life in \nthe private sector so I have been on the receiving end of these \nregulations. I know the costs of these regulations.\n  An economist the other day said, with all this talk about Japan, if \nyou want to be competitive with Japan, export our regulations to Japan \nand we will be competitive.\n  One section of the bill is cost-benefit analysis. The bill will \nrequire the use of cost-benefit analysis for major rules, those which \nhave gross annual effects on the economy of $50 million or more, \nrequiring that the benefits of the rule justify the costs of the rule.\n  This is not the more stringent language we talked about at one time \nback in January of the benefits outweighing the costs, which I would \nprefer, but a much more neutral compromise. This is a commonsense \napproach to costs and benefits. If you are going to buy something for \nyourself at the store, you do not want to pay more than the benefits \nyou receive from it. It is like buying a 32 cent stamp for 50 cents. \nYou just do not do it. It is like throwing away your laptop computer at \nthe end of each day. Smart shoppers want their money's worth, and I \nthink the American public is entitled to get their money's worth by \nhaving some way to measure the value of these regulations.\n  The second area that is addressed is risk assessment. The bill would \nrequire a standardized risk assessment process for all rules which \nprotect human health, safety, or the environment. It will require \n``rational and informed risk management decisions and informed public \ninput into the process of making agency decisions.'' I do not see how \nanyone can be against making informed decisions.\n  This section will require the ``best reasonably available scientific \ndata'' to be used and the risk involved to be characterized in a \ndescriptive manner, and the final risk assessment will be reviewed by a \npanel of peers.\n  These are not outrageous requirements but basic justifications which \nshould be met by the Government before it imposes costly regulations on \nbusinesses costing them millions of dollars and on American families \ncosting them thousands of dollars.\n  The third area is that of the regulatory review and petition process. \nThe bill will require each agency to review its regulations every 5 \nyears to determine if the rule is still necessary. You know, there are \na lot of agencies that are not necessary.\n  I can remember a very famous speech that was made one time by a man \nback in 1965 who later on became President of the United States. He \nobserved in that speech, which I think should be in the textbooks of \nAmericans today-- it was called A Rendezvous With Destiny--he said \nthere is nothing closer to immortality on the face of the Earth than a \ngovernment agency. That is the way it is with regulations. They impose \nthe regulations. Maybe the problem goes away or someone takes away that \nproblem, but the regulations stay in. So this would require that every \n5 years they look and review to see if they are still needed. If the \nagency decides not to rewrite a particular regulation, then members of \nthe regulated community--those are the people that are paying taxes for \nall this fun we are having up here--can petition the agency to have the \nrule reconsidered.\n  Now, this will allow the public to draw attention to the needless \nregulations that help put government back in the hands of the American \npeople. Nothing unreasonable about that at all.\n  Then the fourth area is that of judicial review. The bill will also \nallow for judicial review of these new regulatory requirements. This is \nimportant because the regulated community must have some redress for \npoorly designed or arbitrary regulations. It is no good to require \nregulatory agencies to change their process if there is no one watching \nover to make sure that they comply with this.\n  I realize President Clinton and his regulatory agency heads are dead \nset against the provision. They did not mind that they look over \neverybody else's shoulders enforcing the regulatory nightmares on \nprivate citizens and the companies that are paying for all these taxes, \nbut they do not want the judicial process to oversee them. So overall \nthe bill will go a long way toward preventing needless and overly \nburdensome regulations from taking effect.\n  Unfortunately, there are many examples of existing regulations which \nhave not followed this new process to help stop stupid regulation from \nbeing enacted. I would like to just highlight a couple of these, one \nhaving to do with the wetlands regulations.\n  The EPA and the Army Corps of Engineers have promulgated regulations \nwhich broadly define the definition of what constitutes a wetland. \nUnder the 1989 definition, land could be dry for 350 days a year and \nstill be classified as wetlands. And to add to some of the examples \nthat have been made here on the floor today:\n  Mr. Wayne Hage, a Nevada rancher, hired someone to clear scrub brush \nfrom irrigation ditches along his property and faces up to a 5-year \nsentence under the Clean Water Act because it redirected streams.\n  Another example: Mr. John Pozsgai, a 60-year-old truck mechanic in \nPhiladelphia, filled in an old dump on his property that contained \nabandoned tires, rusty cars, and had to serve nearly 2 years in jail \nbecause he did not get a wetlands permit.\n  James and Mary Mills of Broad Channel, NY, were fined $30,000 for \nbuilding a deck on their house which cast a shadow on a wetland. \n\n[[Page S 9704]]\n\n  Endangered species. The Endangered Species Act has infringed upon the \nproperty rights of property owners all over the country. When 14-year-\nold Eagle Scout Robert Graham was lost for 2 days in the New Mexico \nSanta Fe National Forest, the Forest Service denied a rescue helicopter \nto land and pick up the Scout where he was spotted from the air because \nit was a wilderness area.\n  Mr. Michael Rowe of California wanted to use his land to build on, \nbut it was located in a known habitat of the Kangaroo rat. In order to \nbuild, he was told--keep in mind this is his land that he owns--he was \ntold to hire a biologist for $5,000 to survey the land. If no rats were \nfound, he could then build only if he paid the Government $1,950 an \nacre in development mitigation fees. If even one rat was found, he \ncould not build at all. This is his property, property he bought long \nbefore this thing was in effect.\n  Here we have the Constitution with the 5th amendment and the 14th \namendment that are supposed to protect property rights without due \nprocess.\n  Here is Marj and Roger Krueger who spent $53,000 on a lot for their \ndream- house in the Texas hill country. But they could not build on the \nland because the golden-cheeked warbler had been found in the canyon \nadjacent to their lands.\n  And OSHA regulations. I remember when OSHA regulations first came \nout. At that time I was in business. Of course, I was a part-time \nlegislator in the State of Oklahoma. I was in the State Senate. I used \nto make speeches and take the manual that is about that thick, the OSHA \nManual of Regulations to which all manufacturers had to comply, and I \nwould speak to manufacturers' organizations. And I said, ``I can close \nanybody in the room down.'' I would be challenged. ``No. We run a good \nclean shop. You cannot close us.'' I would find regulations that if you \nwere the type of inspector that would walk in, if you wanted to, you \ncould close someone down.\n  You know, Mr. President, this is one of the problems we have. Years \nago I was mayor of the city of Tulsa. We had about 5,000 uniformed \npolice officers. Most of them were great. Now, you have someone who \ncannot handle the authority that is vested in them by law. The same is \ntrue when you get out in the field. It can happen in any bureaucracy, \nwhether it is the EPA, the OSHA regulators, inspectors, or FAA, anyone \nelse, certainly IRS and FDA, and the rest of them.\n  Anyway, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration is supposed \nto protect safety and health for workers. But too often the regulators \nat OSHA have gone overboard, costing jobs and imposing fines.\n  For example, OSHA regulations have put the tooth fairy out of \nbusiness, requiring dentists to dispose of teeth in the same manner as \nhuman tissue in a closed container for disposal.\n  In Florida, the owner of a three-person silk-screening company was \nfined by OSHA for not having a hazardous communications program for his \ntwo employees.\n  Two employees of DeBest, Inc., a plumbing company in Idaho, jumped \ninto the trench to save the life of a coworker who had been buried \nalive. The company was fined $7,875 because the two workers were not \nwearing the proper head gear when they jumped into the trench.\n  Mr. President, I could just go on and on as they have today with \nexample after example of abuses that have taken place. And they are \nabusing the very people who are paying the taxes.\n  Last, let me reemphasize, this chart speaks for itself because there \nis a direct relationship between the deficits that we have experienced \nevery year and the number of pages in the Federal Register which \nindicates the number of regulations that are in effect.\n  I thank the President for his time.\n  Mr. THOMAS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I rise in support of S. 343, and \nappreciate the comments of my friend from Oklahoma who talked a lot \nabout the details that are very important here, the reason for this \nbill. We have talked about it now for a good long time, as almost is \nalways the case here. Nearly everything has been said, I suppose, in \nterms of the detail, in terms of the bill. But I would like to talk \njust a little bit about the fact that it is so important for us to deal \nwith this question of regulation, overregulation.\n  Clearly, at least in my constituency in Wyoming, the notion of \nregulation and the overregulation, and the cost of regulation and the \ninterference of regulation, is the item most often mentioned by \nconstituents that I talk to. There is no question, of course, that we \nneed regulation. There will continue to be regulation. And, indeed, \nthere should be regulation. Obviously that is one of the functions of \ngovernment.\n  The question is not whether we have regulation or not. And I wish to \ncomment a little, one of our associates this afternoon rose and \nindicated that in his view the idea of having some kind of cost-benefit \nanalysis meant that we would no longer have clean water, that we would \nno longer have clean air. I disagree with that thoroughly.\n  I do not even think that is the issue. The issue of regulation, the \nissue of laws, the issue of having a clean environment, a safe \nworkplace is not the issue. Too often we get off on that notion that \nsomehow this bill will do away with regulation. Not so at all. We had \nan amendment today that said it would be a supplement to the laws and \nthe statutes that exist and the regulations that exist.\n  It is designed to work in process. It deals with the process of the \nthings that are taken into account as the regulations are developed and \nas the regulations are applied. So the notion that somehow the good \nthings that have come about as a result of regulation--and, indeed, \nthere have been and our friend cited the idea that we have a cleaner \nenvironment in many areas, that we have better water than we have had \nin years. That is true. That is not the issue. We are not talking about \ndoing away with those regulations.\n  So I think, Mr. President, we really ought to examine what we are \ndoing here, and the fact is we are looking for a way to apply \nregulations with more common sense. We are looking for a way to apply \nregulations with less cost. We are looking for a way to accomplish what \nregulations are designed to accomplish more efficiently. That is what \nit is all about.\n  I understand that there are different views. I understand that there \nare those who do not choose to take issues like cost-benefit ratios \ninto account. There are those, of course, as has been the case in \nalmost all the issues we have undertaken this year, who prefer the \nstatus quo.\n  But I suggest to you, if there was anything that was loudly spoken in \nNovember of 1994 it was that the Federal Government is too big, it \ncosts too much, and there is too much regulation in our lives, \nintrusive in our lives, that it has to do with economy, it has to do \nwith cost.\n  We already mentioned cost. Some say it ranges from $400 billion a \nyear, more than all of the personal income tax combined, and I believe \nthat is the case.\n  But we need to concentrate on what we are seeking to do, and we are \nseeking to make regulation a more efficient, a more useful tool.\n  There is a notion from time to time that those who seek the status \nquo are more compassionate, are more caring than those who want change. \nI suggest that is not the slightest bit in keeping with the flavor of \nthis bill; that, indeed, we are seeking to find a way to do it better.\n  So, Mr. President, the 1994 elections were about change. The American \npeople, I think, are demanding a change, demanding a regulatory system \nthat works for us as citizens and not against us. I think there is a \nmessage that the status quo is not good enough.\n  For the first time in many years, frankly, the first time in years I \nobserved Congress, certainly in the 6 years I was in the House, we have \nnot really taken a look at the programs that are there. If programs \nseemed not to be effective, if they were not accomplishing much, what \ndid we do? We put more money into it or increased the bureaucracy. We \ndid not really take a look at ways to improve the outcome, to improve \nthe effect to see if, indeed, there is a better way to do it. So we \nneed meaningful and enforceable regulatory reform.\n  There has been a great deal of misinformation about this bill, some \nof it on \n\n[[Page S 9705]]\npurpose, some of it just as a matter of not fully understanding. Most \nof it you see on TV and talk shows, that it does not have the \nregulatory protection. Not true, not true. Clean water, clean air, and \nsafe food are not negotiable. That is not the issue. This bill \nspecifically exempts potential emergency situations from cost-benefit, \nand it will strengthen sound regulations by allocating the resources \nmore wisely.\n  I cannot imagine anything that makes more sense, that makes more \ncommon sense than as a regulation is developed that you take a look at \nwhat you are seeking to do, how you do it, what it will cost, and what \nthe benefits will be and seek the alternatives that are there. That is \nwhat it is all about.\n  It also provides an opportunity for this body, for the Congress to \ntake a look at regulations as they are prepared by the agencies. We did \nthis in our Wyoming Legislature. It was a routine: The statutes were \npassed, the agencies developed regulations to carry them out, and there \nwas an oversight function before those regulations were put into place \nto see if, indeed, they carried out the spirit of the statute, to see \nif, indeed, they were doing what they were designed to do. \nUnfortunately, there, too, we did not have a real analysis of the cost-\nbenefit ratio, and I think that is terribly important.\n  So we talk about compassion, and sometimes those who want to leave \nthings as they are accuse those who want change of not caring. It seems \nto me that when overregulation puts someone out of work, that is not \nvery compassionate. When we put a lid on the growth of the economy, \nthat is not very compassionate. When we take people's property without \nproper remuneration, that is not very compassionate.\n  So we are designed here to do some of those things. It seems to me we \nhave particular interest in the West where 50 percent of our State, for \nexample, is managed and owned by the Federal Government. So we find \nourselves in nearly everything we do, whether it be recreation, whether \nit be grazing, whether it be mining and oil, with a great deal of \nregulation that comes with Federal ownership.\n  Much of it is not simply oriented in business. We talked a lot about \nbusiness because I suppose, on balance, they are the largest recipients \nof overregulation. Let me tell you, the small towns are also very much \naffected. We had several instances recently in the town of Buffalo, WY, \nwhere they are seeking to develop a water system, in one instance, on \nforest lands. So they have to deal with the Forest Service to begin \nwith, and then they have to deal with the EPA, and then they have to \ndeal with the Corps of Engineers and finally are turned down entirely \nand have to start over--millions of dollars of costs to a small town.\n  It has nothing to do with whether they are going to have a clean \nwater supply. It has to do with whether or not there can be a cost-\nbenefit ratio of what is going on, whether there is a risk assessment, \nand that is what this is designed to do.\n  So, Mr. President, our effort here, I think, is a laudable one. I am \nexcited about it. I think we can finally do some things that have \nneeded to be done for a very long time and, I think, do them in a \nsensible way and preserve the reason for regulation, preserve the \nenvironment, preserve the water quality, and do it in a way that is \nmore effective, more cost-effective, more user friendly than in the \npast.\n  I rise in strong support of this bill and, frankly, hope we can move \nto a speedy, successful conclusion.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, one of the primary functions of government \nis to protect the public's health and safety. The purpose of the \nFederal regulatory process is to improve and protect the high quality \nof life that we enjoy in our country. Every day, the people of our \nNation enjoy the benefits of almost a century of progress in Federal \nlaws and regulations that reduce the threat of illness, injury, and \ndeath from consumer products, workplace hazards, and environmental \ntoxins.\n  As the year 2000 approaches, Americans can look back with immense \npride in the progress we have achieved in protections of our health and \nsafety.\n  The economic benefits derived from Federal safeguards such as the \nClean Air Act, the Clean Water Act, the Safe Drinking Water Act, the \nFederal Insecticide, Fungicide and Rodenticide Act [FIFRA], the Food, \nDrug and Cosmetic Act, and the National Highway and Traffic Safety Act, \nare incalculable.\n  The National Highway and Traffic Safety Administration and the \nFederal Highway Administration estimate that Federal safety rules have \nresulted in a net gain to the economy of $412 billion between 1966 and \n1990. According to the Department of Labor, workerplace safety \nregulations have saved at least 140,000 lives since 1970. The Consumer \nProduct Safety Commission estimates that standards in four product \ncategories alone save at least $2.5 billion a year in emergency room \nvisits.\n  While I recognize the tremendous benefits and value of our health and \nsafety laws, I also recognize many instances where Federal agencies \nhave ignored the costs of regulation on businesses, State and local \ngovernments, and individuals, who as a result feel that they are being \nput upon--and rightly so.\n  This is why we need regulatory reform.\n\n\n                       we need regulatory reform\n\n  Mr. President, I firmly believe we need regulatory reform. I believe \nthat all Senators on both sides of the aisle feel very strongly about \nthe need for regulatory reform. Not one of us in the Senate wants the \nstatus quo. Regulatory reform is not a partisan issue. At issue this \nweek will be what kind of reform we achieve. We need regulatory reform \nthat will create a regulatory process that is less burdensome, more \neffective, and more flexible. We need regulatory reform that provides \nreasonable, logical, and appropriate changes in the regulatory process \nthat will eliminate unnecessary burdens on businesses, State and local \ngovernments, and individuals. We need regulatory reform that\n maintains our Federal Government's ability to protect the health and \nsafety of the American people.\n\n  Mr. President, I am committed to the goal of purging regulations that \nhave outlined their usefulness, that are unnecessarily burdensome, or \nthat create needless redtape and bureaucracy.\n  I believe that Federal agencies should issue only those rules that \nwill protect or improve the well-being of the American people and I am \ncommitted to regulatory reform that will ensure this.\n  For these reasons I am an original cosponsor of the Glenn-Chaffee \nbill S. 1001, the Regulatory Procedures Reform Act of 1995.\n\n\n           EXAMPLES OF THE KIND OF REGULATORY REFORM WE NEED\n\n  Last year, I pushed a bill through the Senate to allow the city of \nSan Diego to apply for a waiver from certain Clean Water Act \nregulations.\n  Scientists at the National Academy of Sciences and the Scripps \nInstitute of Oceanography informed us that the regulations mandating \nthat the city treat its sewage to full secondary level were unnecessary \nto protect the city's coastal waters.\n  Compliance with those regulations, put in place to protect inland \nlakes, rivers, and streams, would do little to protect the marine \nenvironment but would cost San Diego over $1 billion.\n  My bill allowed the city to seek a waiver which is not available \nunder current law, giving San Diego the flexibility it needs to protect \nthe marine environment and to focus its resources on other \nenvironmental priorities.\n  The Environment and Public Works Committee, of which I am a member, \nis currently working on the reauthorization of the Safe Drinking Water \nAct, the Clean Water Act, other environmental statutes and we are very \naware that we need to be mindful of situations like San Diego's--\nsituations where a regulation that makes sense in one place makes \nlittle or no sense in another.\n  For example, under the current Safe Drinking Water Act, EPA may have \nto issue a rule on radon in drinking water. Radon is a known carcinogen \nand should be regulated. But in the case of a city like Fresno, CA, the \ncosts of compliance with such a regulation could be staggering. Unlike \nmany cities which have a single drinking water treatment plant, Fresno \nrelies on water from over 200 wells, each of which would require its \nown Radon\n treatment facility.\n\n  Meeting the EPA's proposed Radon rule could cost the city of Fresno \nseveral times what it would cost other \n\n[[Page S 9706]]\ncities--over $300 million, an amount the city tells me is simply not \navailable. We will therefore work to come up with a solution that \nprotects public health, but doesn't drive cities like Fresno to \nbankruptcy.\n  Mr. President, it is our job to fix these problems, to make changes \nto eliminate the unintended consequences of good laws. The best way to \navoid unnecessary, costly and burdensome regulations is to ensure that \nthe agency analysis of the proposed regulation is based on sound \nscience and reasonable policy assumptions. An agency must consider the \ncosts and the benefits of a regulation, and the possibility for \nalternative regulatory solutions or no regulation at all.\n  With this in mind, President Clinton issued Executive order 12866 in \nSeptember 1993. The Executive order emphasizes that while regulation \nplays an important role in protecting the health safety and environment \nof the American people, the Federal Government has a basic \nresponsibility to govern wisely and carefully, regulating only when \nnecessary and only in the most cost effective manner.\n  Can risk assessment and cost-benefit analysis be useful tools to make \nour regulations more efficient and less burdensome? Yes, and under \nPresident Clinton's September 1993 Executive order on regulatory \nplanning and review, the Federal Government is using these tools \nappropriately and responsibly. Unlike the Dole bill, the President's \nExecutive order does not mistake a sometimes useful tool for the whole \ntool-box.\n  As former Senator Robert Stafford--the chairman of the Environment \nand Public Works Committee when Republicans controlled the Senate in \nthe 1980's--put it:\n\n       We did not abolish slavery after a cost-benefit analysis, \n     nor prohibit child labor after a risk assessment. We did \n     those things because money was only one way of expressing \n     value--and sometimes it is the least important.\n\n  When money becomes the only measure of value--as it would under the \nDole bill--we are in danger of losing the things in life that really \nmatter. You can't put a price on saving lives, preventing birth \ndefects, avoiding learning disabilities, preserving national parks or \nsaving the ozone layer. Under the Dole-Johnston bill, the ability of \nour laws to protect public health and safety would depend upon a \nbureaucrat's estimate of the dollar value of a child's learning \ndisability, the pain of cancer, or the loss of a life in an aircraft \naccident.\n  Mr. President, ultimately our responsibility as legislators\n   is to improve the lives of all the American people, not just the \nbottom line of the corporations.\n\n\n       THE DOLE BILL IS NOT A RESPONSIBLE REGULATORY REFORM BILL\n\n  Republicans know they can't risk the potential political consequences \nof an open attack on our environmental health and safety laws. One of \ntheir own pollsters, Luntz Research and Strategic Services, recently \ncompleted a poll on regulatory reform that asked: Which should be \nCongress' higher priority: cut regulations or do more to protect the \nenvironment? Twenty-nine percent said cut regulations. Sixty-two \npercent said protect the environment. The pollster goes on to comment:\n\n       This question is here as a warning . . . The public may not \n     like or admire regulations, may not think more are necessary, \n     but puts environmental protection as a higher priority than \n     cutting regulations.\n\n  They have come up with an ideal back-door solution: This week we will \nspend many hours debating the proposal forwarded to the Senate by the \nmajority leader Senator Dole, that will, in the name of regulatory \nreform, seriously undermine existing health, safety and environmental \nlaws and seriously weaken our ability to respond to current and future \nhealth, safety and environmental problems. Supporters of the Dole-\nJohnston bill are clearly not listening to the American people.\n  Unfortunately Mr. President, the Republican proposal before us today \nis unashamedly aimed at our public health and safety and environmental \nlaws in the name of special interests.\n  It is a direct attack by the Republican majority on the laws and \nregulations that protect America's natural resources including those we \ntake most for granted--laws that protect our clean air and water and \nsafe drinking water. It is a direct attack on the laws and regulations \nthat protect the health and safety of the food and the medicines we buy \nevery day, the toys we give to our children, the cars we drive, the \nplaces where we work.\n  Supporters of Dole-Johnston will claim again and again over the \ncourse of this week, that it is only aimed at stopping regulatory \nexcesses and at making the Federal Government justify the costs of the \nregulations it imposes. They will say that the Dole-Johnston bill is \naimed at restoring common sense to the regulatory process. All this \nbill does, they will say, is make the Government responsible by making \nagencies consider the costs as well as the benefits of regulations. To \nbe opposed to this bill they will say is to defend inefficient, \nirrational agency decisions.\n  Mr. President, the Dole-Johnston bill is not regulatory\n   reform in the name of efficiency and good government, it is \nregulatory gridlock in the name of special interests and corporate \npolluters.\n\n  Republicans insist this bill is revolutionary regulatory reform. The \ntitle of the Dole/Johnston bill is the Regulatory Reform Act of 1995. I \nthink we should rename it for what it is--the Lets Put Special Interest \nProfits Before Health and Safety Act, or The Regulatory Gridlock Act, \nor The Polluters Protection Act, or The Special Interest Litigation \nAct.\n  I support regulatory reform that will create a regulatory process \nthat is less burdensome, more effective, and more flexible. I support \nregulatory reform that provides reasonable, logical and appropriate \nchanges in the regulatory process that will eliminate unnecessary \nburdens on businesses, state and local governments and individuals. I \nsupport regulatory reform that maintains our federal government's \nability to protect the health and safety of the American people.\n  Unfortunately, the Dole/Johnston bill does not achieve these goals.\n  The Dole/Johnston bill's definition of major rule to mean a rule--or \na group of closely related rules--that is likely to have a gross annual \neffect on the economy of $50 million or more in reasonably \nqualitifiable direct or indirect costs will greatly increase the burden \nof our agencies. Just about any rule can be made out to have a $50 \nmillion gross effect on the economy in reasonably qualitifiable--direct \nand indirect--increased costs. I seriously question whether the \nenormous number of regulations that could be swept in under this \nstandard will benefit, and whether resources spent on the cost-benefit \nanalysis will be well spent. Perhaps we should subject the provisions \nof the Dole bill to a cost benefit analysis.\n  With its petition process and look back provisions, the Dole bill \nwill allow any well financed bad actor to paralyze an agency by \nflooding it with petitions. This would prevent the agency from spending \nresources on developing new rules, and from reviewing old rules--\nforcing a stay on enforcement and the eventual sunset of rules.\n  Its provisions on so called supplemental decision criteria create a \nsupermandate. Supporters of Dole/Johnston deny this claim. They insist \nthat the intent is not to supersede but to supplement the decisional \ncriteria in other statutes. However, the bill clearly overrides other \nstatutes including our health, safety and environmental laws because \nthe supplementary standards would still have to be met. The Dole bill \ngoes well beyond sensible reform by establishing a goal that is \nabsolutely at odds with our responsibility to improve the well-being of \nall the American people. It says that we should protect only those \nvalues that can be measured in dollars and cents--it is a corporate \nbean-counter's dream. Forget about saving lives, forget about getting \npoison out of our air and water, forget about preventing birth defects, \ninfertility and cancer--if it you can't put a price tag on it, it \ndoesn't count.\n  Its provisions on the toxic release inventory will significantly \nundermine a community's right to know who is polluting and what kind of \ntoxics are being released into the air. TRI is an effective cost-saving \ntool: Public scrutiny as a result of the information released under the \n1986 Emergency Planning and Community Right to Know \n\n[[Page S 9707]]\nAct has often prompted industry to lower pollution levels without the \nneed for new Government regulations.\n  All in all, Mr. President, the Dole/Johnston bill is a prescription \nfor no Government protection. It does exactly the opposite of what's \nadvertised.\n  Another key aspect of the Dole/Johnston bill is how it will affect \nour ability to respond quickly to public health, safety and the \nenvironment.\n  The Dole bill will further delay the rulemaking procedures of the \nagencies of the Department of Transportation, particularly their \nability to respond promptly with new safety requirements.\n  Many of the safety rules, particularly at FAA, already take too long. \nAs the FAA clearly knows, I have been concerned about air cabin safety \nsince a 1991 crash at Los Angeles airport when 21 passengers died in a \nfire while trying to exit the aircraft. We urged the FAA to require \nthat the seat rows at the overwing exist be widened. The agency had \nknown since a 1985 crash in England that this was a problem, but it was \nnot until 1992, 7 years after the crash in England and nearly a year \nand a half following the Los Angeles tragedy did the agency issue a \nfinal rule.\n  If these bills had been in law then, I would not be surprised to \nstill be waiting for the completion of the risk assessment and cost \nbenefit analysis for this rulemaking. And the families of 21 passengers \nwho died in the Los Angeles crash would still be waiting to know if any \ngood had come out of their tragedy.\n  Mr. President, we currently have critically important regulations on \ne-coli, cryptosporidium and mammograms that will grant the American \npeople much needed health and safety protection. The Dole/Johnston bill \nwould delay and possibly prevent the issuance of these regulations.\n  As the bill now stands, only those rules which represent an emergency \nor health or safety threat that is likely to result in significant harm \nto the public or natural resources would be exempt from the new \nrequirements.\n  There is no definition of the terms significant or likely in the \nbill, making it unclear whether existing environmental and health \nregulations qualify for an exemption.\n  The Dole/Johnston bill has an exemption for health and safety \nregulations that protect the public from significant harm, but it does \nnot define the term significant.\n  If one child dies as a result of eating contaminated meat, does that \npose a significant harm to the public? It's certainly significant to \nthe child's parents and to others who ate at the same restaurant or \nbought meat at the same grocery store.\n  If a person with a weakened immune system--for example a cancer \npatient, an organ transplant recipient, an individual born with genetic \nimmune deficiencies, or a person infected with HIV becomes ill and dies \nfrom drinking water infected with cryptosporidium. Will the Dole bill \nlet our agencies determine that cryptosporidium poses a significant \nharm, to the public? What if 104 die as they did in 1993 in Milwaukee?\n  If a woman has her mammogram read by someone who is poorly trained in \nmammography, is it of significant harm to the public? It's certainly \nsignificant to the woman if that person fails to detect a cancerous \nlump and to other women who have mammograms at that facility.\n\n\n                                 e-coli\n\n  According to the Centers for Disease Control, E-coli in food makes \n20,000 people severely ill every year and causes 500 deaths; that's \nmore than one death every day. Young children and the elderly are \nparticularly vulnerable. There is clearly an urgent need for additional \nprotection.\n  In January 1995, the U.S. Department of Agriculture proposed a new \nrule that will modernize our food safety inspection system for the \nfirst time since 1906 by requiring the use of scientific testing to \ndirectly target and reduce harmful bacteria.\n  Currently, meat inspectors do just as they did in 1906 to check for \nbad meat--they poke and sniff. No scientific sampling is required. \nHandling meat safely once we purchase it is not enough.\n  The proposed regulation would require keeping meat refrigerated at \nmore steps during its processing, better procedures to prevent fecal \ncontamination, and testing to be sure that pathogens like e-coli are \ncontrolled.\n  What are the estimated benefits of this legislation? The preliminary \nimpact analysis by the USDA concluded that health benefits to the \npublic would total $1 billion to $3.7 billion. The estimated cost of \nimplementation of the regulation would be $250 million per year for the \nfirst 3 years. I am aware of the concerns of small business about the \npotential impact of this regulation and I would urge the USDA to do \neverything possible to mitigate the potential impact as effectively as \npossible rather than delay the rule.\n  The USDA held 11 public meetings, two 3-day conferences and received \ndetailed comments from the National Advisory Group for Microbiological \nCriteria in Food.\n  The Dole/Johnston bill would among other things require a new peer \nreview process which would cause a 6 month delay. Add to this that fact \nthat the Dole/Johnston peer review panel would not exclude individuals \nwho have a conflict of interest.\n\n\n                  cryptosporidium--safe drinking water\n\n  We have to ensure that one of the most fundamental needs of any \nsociety--safe drinking water--is available to all Americans.\n  Public health continues to be threatened by contaminated drinking \nwater. Under the current law that is being criticized as overly costly \nand burdensome--a law approved by a Republican controlled EPW \nCommittee, passed by a vote of 94-0 on the Senate floor and signed into \nlaw by President Ronald Reagan--people all across America have been \ngetting sick and even dying from drinking tap water.\n  In 1987, 13,000 people became ill in Carrollton, GA as a result of \nbacterial contamination in their drinking water. In 1990, 243 people \nbecame ill and 4 died as a result of E-coli bacteria in the drinking \nwater in Cabool, MO. In 1992, 15,000 people were sickened by \ncontaminated drinking water in Jackson County, OR. And a year ago, \n400,000 people in Milwaukee became ill and 104 died as a result of \ndrinking the water from their taps which was infected with \ncryptosporidium.\n  A recent study completed by the Natural Resources Defense Council \n``You Are What You Drink'' found that from a sampling of fewer than 100 \nutilities that responded to their inquiries, over 45 million Americans \ndrank water supplied by systems that found the unregulated contaminant \nCryptosporidium in their raw or treated water.\n  The solution? According to a Wall Street Journal article by Tim \nFerguson on June 27th titled ``Drinking-Water Option Comes in a \nBottle'', the solution is for the American people to drink bottled \nwater. He says:\n\n       Sellers (of bottled water) * * * have taken\n        water quality to a new level in a far more efficient \n     manner than a Washington bureaucracy is likely to do. Let \n     us unscrew our bottle caps and drink to the refreshment of \n     choice.\n\n  On June 15th, 1995, two federal agencies, the Environmental \nProtection Agency and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention \n[CDC] warned that drinking tap water could be fatal to Americans with \nweakened immune systems and suggested that they take the precaution of \nboiling water before consuming it.\n  Dennis Juranek, associate director of the division of parasitic \ndiseases at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said: ``We \ndon't know if the level of (cryptosporidium) in the water poses a \npublic health threat, but we cannot rule out that there will be low \nlevel transmission of the bacteria'' to people who consume the water \ndirectly from the tap.\n  The CDC estimates that up to 6 million Americans could be affected \nbecause they have weakened immune systems: 3 to 5 million cancer \npatients, organ transplant recipients and individuals born with genetic \nimmune deficiencies, and 1 million persons infected with HIV.\n  EPA is working on new regulations called the Enhanced Surface Water \nTreatment Rule to better protect the public's drinking water against \ncryptosporidium.\n  The Dole/Johnston bill would delay and possible prevent the issuance \nof the Enhanced Surface Water Treatment rule--it would restrict risk \nassessment to consideration of a best estimate of risk, defined as the \naverage \n\n[[Page S 9708]]\nimpacts on the population. It would ignore the potential health effects \nof drinking water contaminants upon children, infants, pregnant women, \nthe elderly, chronically ill people, and other persons who have \nparticularly high susceptibility to drinking water contaminants.\n  According to the EPA, the Dole bill could preclude the timely data-\ngathering necessary to support the new proposed regulation. It could \nforce EPA into a catch-22, in which data gathering cannot proceed \nwithout a cost-benefit analysis that in the Dole bill requires up-\nfront, the very data the EPA would need to collect. Even if the EPA was \nallowed to proceed with data collection, the Dole bill's elaborate, \ninflexible, time consuming risk assessment and cost-benefit analysis \nprocedures would further hamper the EPA from taking effective and \ntimely action with which the regulated community concurs, through \nnegotiated rulemaking, to address the emergent threats of newly \nrecognized waterborne diseases.\n\n\n                        mammography regulations\n\n  The Mammography Quality Standards Act [MQSA] is an example of a good \nand necessary regulation which would be seriously delayed and \nundermined by the Dole bill.\n  MQSA establishes national quality standards for mammography \nfacilities, including the quality of films produced, training for \nclinic personnel, record-keeping and equipment.\n  The law was passed to address a wide range of problems at mammography \nfacilities: poor quality equipment, poorly trained technicians and \nphysicians, false representation of accreditation, and the lack of \ninspections or governmental oversight.\n  One in nine women are at risk of being diagnosed with breast cancer \nin her lifetime. Breast cancer is the most common form of cancer in \nAmerican women and the leading killer of women between the ages of 35 \nand 52. In 1995, an estimated 182,000 new cases of breast cancer will \nbe diagnosed, and 46,000 women will die of the disease. Breast self-\nexamination and mammography are the only tools women have to detect \nbreast cancer early, when it can be treated with the least \ndisfigurement and when chances for survival are highest.\n  The quality of a mammogram can mean the difference between life or \ndeath. If the procedure is done incorrectly, and a bad picture is \ntaken, then a radiologist reading the x-ray may miss seeing potentially \ncancerous lumps. Conversely, a bad picture can show lumps where none \nexist and a women will have to undergo the trauma of being told she may \nhave cancer--a situation known as a false positive.\n  To get a good quality mammogram you need the right film and the \nproper equipment. To protect women undergoing the procedure, you also \nneed the correct radiation dose.\n  In 1992, Congress passed the Mammography Quality Standards Act in \norder to establish national quality standards for mammography \nfacilities. At the time, both the GAO and the American College of \nRadiology testified before Congress that the former patchwork of \nFederal, State, and private standards were inadequate to protect women.\n  There were a number of problems at mammography facilities: poor \nquality equipment, poorly trained technicians and physicians, a lack of \nregular inspections, and facilities which told women they were \naccredited when in fact they were not.\n  The Mammography Quality Standards Act was passed to address these \nserious problems. Women's health and lives are at stake with this \nprocedure. Quality standards are needed to ensure that they are getting \nthe best care possible. Final regulations for the Mammography Quality \nStandards Act are expected in October. If the Dole bill passes, such \nregulations could be delayed for years. Women would see their health \ncare diminished. Ten years ago a survey by the Food and Drug \nAdministration found that over one-third of the x-ray machines used for \nmammography produced substandard results. We cannot go back. It is time \nfor national quality standards.\n\n\n                               conclusion\n\n  Mr. President, I would like to conclude my remarks by saying again \nthat supporters of the Dole/Johnston bill are clearly not listening to \nthe American people. The Dole/Johnston bill is a back door attack on \nour existing health, safety and environmental laws and will seriously \nweaken our ability to respond to current and future health, safety and \nenvironmental problems.\n  The American people want regulatory reform that will create a \nregulatory process that is less burdensome, more effective, and more \nflexible. The American people want regulatory reform that provides \nreasonable, logical, and appropriate changes in the regulatory process \nthat will eliminate unnecessary burdens on businesses, State, and local \ngovernments and individuals. The American people want regulatory reform \nthat maintains our Federal Government's ability to protect the health \nand safety of the American people.\n  In summary Mr. President, the American people want the passage of the \nGlenn/Chafee regulatory reform bill.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/07/11/senate-section/article/S9695-1", "month": "07", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "11", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9708]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. DOLE.

Mr. President, I rise tonight to deplore the fall of the \nBosnian City of Srebrenica.\n  Almost 2 years ago, when Srebrenica was under siege in the despicable \npolicy of ethnic cleansing, instigated by President Milosevic of Serbia \nand executed by General Silajdzic and the leader of the Bosnian Serbs, \nMr. Karadzic, I met with Mr. Milosevic to attempt to get into \nSrebrenica. I was unable to do that and went on up to Tuzla where \nhundreds, eventually thousands, of Bosnian Serbs and Croats were \nfleeing for their lives with all of their possessions on their back and \ntheir families in tow.\n  I met in Tuzla with a man and a woman in their early forties who told \nme they had to make a very difficult decision as they fled over the \nmountains into Tuzla from Srebrenica, because they could not get back \nin. And I was wondering what that terrible decision was they were about \nto tell me. They pointed out they had left to die on the mountain top \nin the snow the man's elderly mother who was 81. They had to choose \nbetween taking their kids or the mother-in-law, or the wife, who could \nmake it, or no one making it.\n  The Bosnian Serb aggression and Serbian aggression--I know I sound \nlike a broken record, I have been speaking about this for 2 years--\nseems to cause very little concern in this country and the world.\n  Mr. President, I think it is time for an immediate and fundamental \nchange in our policy in the former Yugoslavia. Mr. President, the news \nthis morning that the Bosnian Serbs have overrun, finally, Srebrenica, \none of the United Nations' so-called safe areas, puts the final nail in \nthe coffin of a bankrupt policy in the former Yugoslavia, begun by the \nBush administration and continued with only minor adjustments by the \nClinton administration.\n  Given the feckless performance of the United Nations in Bosnia, it is \nno surprise that the Bosnian Serbs continue to violate several United \nNations resolutions, and do it with impunity, and then thumb their nose \nat the entire world and the peacekeeping force there.\n  In Srebrenica, the United Nations first disarmed the Bosnian \nGovernment military. I want to remind everybody of that. The Bosnian \nGovernment military was in Srebrenica, as in other safe areas, fighting \nthe onslaught of Serbs with heavy artillery. The solution put forward \nby the United Nations, after having imposed an embargo on the \n\n[[Page S 9709]]\nBosnian Government, was to go in and take the weapons from the Bosnian \nSerbs, the Bosnian military in Srebrenica, in return for a guarantee of \nprotection for six safe areas. That was the deal.\n  It was supposed to be putting the city and the surrounding areas \nunder the protection of the United Nations. Then the United Nations, of \ncourse, did not live up to its half of the bargain. Its blue-helmeted \npeacekeepers were kept lightly armed and, as a consequence, unable to \nwithstand a Bosnian Serb onslaught. NATO air strikes were called for by \nthe Dutch blue hats. The United Nations concluded that this was not a \ngood time to do that. NATO air strikes were eventually called in too \nlate to have any effect. The safe area of Srebrenica proved to be safe \nonly for Serbian aggressors.\n  Srebrenica was filled with thousands of Moslem refugees from \nelsewhere in eastern Bosnia, the victims of the vile Serbian practice \nthat they refer to as ethnic cleansing, the very people the United \nNations pledged to protect in return for them giving up what few \nweapons they had. The United Nations defaulted on its honor. It has \ndisgraced itself. And these pathetic souls, already once driven from \ntheir ancestral homes, are now reportedly fleeing Srebrenica to an \nuncertain fate in undetermined locations, and I expect many will meet \nthe fate of that family I visited in Tuzla a year and a half ago.\n  Could the United Nations have saved Srebrenica? Of course it could \nhave, if it only allowed NATO to do its job promptly and fully. Perhaps \nthe most frustrating and maddening aspect of the entire catastrophe is \nthe fact that the Bosnian Serbs were able to defy NATO, which has been \nhobbled by being tied to the timorous U.N. civilian command, led by Mr. \nAkashi.\n  Mr. President, we must immediately change the course of our policy in \nthe former Yugoslavia. First of all, as I and others have been saying \nin this Chamber for more than 2 years, we must lift the illegal and \nimmoral arms embargo on the Government of Bosnia and Herzegovina. A \nresolution to that effect, which I am cosponsoring, will be introduced \nnext week. I am confident that it will pass with a comfortable \nmajority.\n  Mr. President, the fall of Srebrenica has given the lie to pundits in \nthe United States--but especially in Western Europe--who have \nceaselessly issued dire warnings that if the United States would \nunilaterally lift the arms embargo, the Bosnian Serbs would then \noverrun the eastern enclaves.\n  Well, Mr. President, apparently, someone forgot to explain this \ncausal relationship to the Serbs. I suppose the apostles of appeasement \nwill now say that if we lift the embargo, the Bosnian Serbs will \noverrun the remaining two enclaves, or maybe Sarajevo, or maybe Western \nEurope. After all, Mr. President, we have been led to believe that we \nare facing a juggernaut. That is nonsense. We are talking about a \nthird-rate, poorly motivated, middle-aged force that has to dragoon its \nreserves from the cafes of Belgrade to fight.\n  In reality, of course, this tiresome rhetoric has been a smokescreen \nfor doing nothing, for sitting back and watching this vile ethnic \ncleansing, mass rapes, cowardly sniping at children, and other military \ntactics at which the Bosnian Serbs excel. ``How regrettable,'' the \nappeasers say publicly. ``But as long as these quarrelsome south Slavs \ncontain their feuding to Bosnia,'' they add, ``then it is nothing to \nget too exercised about.''\n  Well, Mr. President, it is something to get exercised about. The \ngeostrategic reality of the 21st century is that the primary danger to \npeace will most likely come from regional ethnic crises. We must not \nallow cold-blooded aggressors like Karadzic and Milosevic to get away \nwith their terrorism. Europe, unfortunately, has other potential \nKaradzics and Milosevics.\n  After we lift the arms embargo on Bosnia and Herzegovina, we should \nimmediately put into place a program to train Bosnian Government \ntroops, probably in Croatia.\n  We should make clear that we are not neutral parties in this \nconflict, we are on the side of the aggrieved party, the Bosnian \nGovernment.\n  This does not require a single American troop to set foot in Bosnia \nand Herzegovina. I have been told time and again that these folks \ncannot defend themselves. Well, of course they cannot defend \nthemselves, they have no weapons.\n  We should make it clear, Mr. President, that we are no longer signing \non to this incredible policy that has been promoted in Europe.\n  We should call an emergency session of the North Atlantic Council and \ntell our allies that NATO must immediately remove itself from the U.N. \nchain of command in the former Yugoslavia. The conflict there already \nconstitutes a clear and present danger to the European members of the \nalliance. NATO does not need the blessing of the United Nations to \nprotect its members' vital interests.\n  Furthermore, we should restate to our NATO allies who have \npeacekeeping troops in Bosnia and Croatia that we will stand by \nPresident Clinton's commitment to extricate them, but only if the \nentire operation is under the command of the Supreme Allied Commander \nin Europe, a United States general, and only if the operation is fully \nconducted under NATO rules of engagement.\n  We should give immediate public warning to the Bosnian Serbs and \ntheir patrons in Belgrade that any further locking-on of radar to \nAmerican planes flying over Bosnia will be cause for total destruction \nof the Bosnian Serb radar facilities, which is fully, totally within \nour capacity to do. Serbia should be given fair warning that if it \ntries to intervene, it, too, will receive immediate and \ndisproportionate attacks on Serbia proper.\n  There is no reason why our British, French, Dutch, and other NATO \nallies should object to this policy. If, however, Mr. President, they \ndo not wish to follow our lead, then we should remind them that four \nyears ago they wanted to handle this southern European problem \nthemselves. And we should say, ``Well, good luck, it is now your \nproblem, handle it.''\n  I do not think for a minute, Mr. President, they will take on that \nresponsibility. It is about time this President and this administration \nunderstands that we either should do it our way or get out.\n  Mr. President, nothing good can come out of this latest fiasco in \nBosnia. The United Nations has been definitively discredited. NATO has \nbeen defied. As usual, defenseless and blameless Bosnian Moslems have \nbeen brutalized.\n  This madness must stop, Mr. President. We must change our policy \nimmediately. Tomorrow is not soon enough.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. Mr. President, I want to join in the comments of my \ndistinguished colleague from Delaware. I could not agree with him more \nconcerning the events of recent hours, and as far as our policies are \nconcerned concerning those events in that part of the country.\n  What concerns me most about all of this is the credibility of the \nUnited States of America. I am beginning to wonder if we have any \ncredibility in any part of the world anymore.\n  Following the disastrous U.N. lead, and to a certain extent the NATO \nlead there, not getting them to go along with sound policies and \nlifting the arms embargo with their cooperation, one sad tale after \nanother, we have gone down a road of totally participating in the \ndiscrediting of the United Nations, of NATO, and our own country.\n  I think that the first step toward rectifying that certainly is not \nputting our own troops in there, but letting the people defend \nthemselves, which is all they say they want to do, lifting that arms \nembargo, stepping back and saying, ``It is your problem. You solve it. \nYou take care of it.''\n  That is what they deserve to do. We cannot afford to stand by, \nthrough our policies, and let this murderous activity go on, and say to \nthe world that we, the strongest power in the world, supposedly are \ngoing to countenance that sort of thing and not use the many resources, \nshort of troops on the ground, that we have, to do something about such \nterrible activities.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/07/11/senate-section/article/S9708-2", "month": "07", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "11", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9709-S9712]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  COMPREHENSIVE REGULATORY REFORM ACT\n\n  Mr. THOMPSON.\n   Mr. President, I rise tonight in support of \n\n[[Page S 9710]]\n\n\nS. 343, the Comprehensive Regulatory Reform Act of 1995. This bill is \nan essential part of our effort to make the Federal Government run more \nefficiently and effectively, and curtail its ability to impose \nunnecessary burdens on the American people.\n  We have already enacted laws that will reduce unfunded mandates and \nthe burdens of paperwork on State and local governments, as well as the \naverage citizen. We are moving decisionmaking back to the States in \nmany important areas, because the States are closer to the people and \nto the problems that need to be solved. We are making real progress \ntoward eliminating Federal departments and agencies that no longer \nserve a useful purpose. Most importantly, we are well on our way to \nrequiring that the Federal Government live within its means in the form \nof a balanced budget.\n  This bill is the next logical step in this process of rethinking the \nrole of the Federal Government in everyday life. This bill's message is \nvery simple. It says: let Members make sure that the Federal Government \nadequately protects the health and safety of every American. But, also \nmake sure that, when agencies develop regulations to provide that \nprotection, those regulations are founded in good, common sense. Get \nout of the mindset that the Federal Government needs to regulate \neverything in this country. And, set priorities, so that the Federal \nGovernment addresses the most important problems citizens face.\n  How does this bill accomplish these goals? Well, the bill requires \nagencies to make accurate determinations about the good a potential \nregulation can bring about. In other words, how much disease or \npremature death can be avoided? Or, how much less dangerous can a \nsituation be made? In answering these questions, the Federal agency \nmust be as precise as possible, using the most carefully prepared and \nup-to-date scientific information.\n  Then, the agency needs to look at the negative impact that very same \nregulation may have on Americans. For example, how much more will the \naverage American have to pay for a particular product? Will some \nAmericans lose their jobs? Will some products no longer be available to \nAmerican people at all? Will citizens have to spend a greater amount of \ntheir leisure time complying with Government mandates? Will preventing \none disease cause an increase in some other equally dangerous disease?\n  Once all of these important questions have been asked and answered, \nS. 343 requires the Federal agency to put all of this information \ntogether and ask the central question: Do the benefits\n of this rule outweigh the costs? Or, in more simple terms: Does this \nrule produce enough good things for our citizens to make the negative \nimpacts tolerable?\n\n  Mr. President, what I have just laid out is S. 343's approach to \ndeveloping and issuing Federal rules. I think the American people would \nsay that this approach is based in ordinary common sense. This is how \nthey make decisions on countless questions that come up in their own \nlives every single day. Do I spend money for a newer, safer car, or \nkeep my old one? Do I put money aside for retirement or do I spend it \nnow? Americans make calculations about the costs and benefits of their \nbehavior all the time.\n  And now, Americans are asking that the Federal Government approach \nproblems in this way too. They are asking regulators to make decisions \nas if they were sitting around the kitchen table. They understand that \nthe Federal Government deals with complicated problems. What they don't \nunderstand is why the answers to these problems cannot be developed \nfrom the same process that they use at home.\n  Mr. President, so far, I have described the method S. 343 lays out \nfor determining the costs and benefits of Federal regulations. Some of \nour colleagues believe that S. 343 would be a pretty good bill if it \njust stopped right there. In my view, if we could trust the agencies to \ndo the right thing, we could stop there. Unfortunately, recent history \ntells us that the agencies sometime need more encouragement to actually \ndo what is right.\n  Since the early 1970's, Presidents have asked Federal agencies to \nanalyze the costs and benefits of a regulation before issuing it. On \nSeptember 30, 1993, President Clinton continued that longstanding \ntradition by putting in place an Executive order. The philosophy and \nprinciples contained in S. 343 largely mirror those in the Executive \norder of President Clinton. That is where the similarity stops. As with \nall Executive orders, President Clinton's specifically precludes \njudicial review as a way of forcing agencies to consider costs and \nbenefits before issuing rules.\n  If Federal agencies were complying with the Executive order, we would \nnot be here on the Senate floor tonight. The fact is that they are not. \nWhen the whim suits them, Federal agencies comply with the Executive \norder. When it does not, they do not. In most cases, agencies are not \nmaking careful assessments of the positive and negative impacts of \ntheir regulations.\n  That is why, in my view, the judicial review provisions of S. 343 are \nso important--in fact, vital--to this legislation. We must provide \njudicial review if the legal protections we enact in this bill are to \nhave any significance. Only the availability of judicial review will \nensure that agencies will analyze the costs\n and benefits of major rules, as this bill requires.\n\n  Mr. President, S. 343's judicial review provisions provide an \nessential tool for citizens to hold their Government--and in particular \nunelected regulators--accountable. But, the bill does not--as its \nopponents charge--create new causes of action that will clog the \ncourts. This bill merely directs courts, reviewing otherwise reviewable \nagency action, to consider the compliance of the agency with the \nrequirements of this legislation.\n  Mr. President, I will have more to say on the important subject of \njudicial review as this debate goes forward.\n  S. 343 contains two other provisions that will force Federal \nregulators to produce sensible regulations also. The first of these \nprovisions, in my view is most important, that is chapter 8 of S. 343, \nwhich authorizes congressional review of regulations. My colleagues \nwill recall that this language is virtually identical to the \ncongressional review bill that the Senate passed earlier this year in \nthe place of a 1-year moratorium on regulations.\n  Section 801 gives the Congress 60 days to review a final rule before \nthat rule actually becomes effective. During that time, Congress can \ndetermine whether the rule is consistent with the law Congress passed \nin the first place. Perhaps more importantly, Congress can look at the \nrule to see if it makes good sense. I think that this process will not \nonly hold the regulators' feet to the fire, but it will also keep \nCongress from passing laws that do not work or are too costly.\n  S. 343 also makes Federal agencies accountable by requiring them to \nreview periodically the rules that they put on the books. Some rules \nthat addressed important needs a long time ago are no longer necessary. \nSome may just need rethinking. In my view, this is a healthy process \nfor agencies to be engaged in on a regular basis.\n  Mr. President, if all of this common sense is still not enough to get \nsome of my colleagues to support this legislation, perhaps a few \nstatistics on the cost of Federal regulation will illustrate the need \nto reign them in. After all, Federal regulations operate as a hidden \ntax on every American.\n  It has been estimated that the total cost of Federal regulations is \nabout equal to the Federal tax burden on the American people--a cost of \nmore than $10,000 per household. One estimate of the direct cost \nimposed by Federal regulations on the private sector and on State and \nlocal governments in 1992 was $564 billion; another estimate put the \ncost at $857 billion.\n  When the total Federal regulatory burden is broken down into parts, \nwe find several staggering statistics. Economic regulations--imposed \nlargely on the communications, trucking, and banking industries--cost \nover $200 billion a year. Paperwork costs--the cost to merely collect, \nreport, and maintain information for Federal regulators--add another \n$200 billion a year and consume over 64 billion person hours per year \nin the private sector. This figure does not include the massive number \nof hours Federal employees spend on processing and evaluation \ninformation.\n  Environmental regulation is estimated to cost $122 billion, which \nrepresents approximately 2 percent of the \n\n[[Page S 9711]]\ngross domestic product. And finally, in 1992, safety and other social \nregulations imposed costs ranging from $29 billion to $42 billion in \n1992.\n  The numbers reflect the high costs of regulation to the private \nsector--and I should remind my colleagues that those costs must be \nborne by small businesses as well as the larger ones. As we all know, a \ngood portion of those costs are passed through to all of us in the form \nof higher prices. But we also pay for the Government's costs to \nadminister these regulations, and those costs are soaring too.\n  Measured in constant 1987 dollars, Federal regulatory spending grew \nfrom $8.8 billion in 1980 to $11.3 billion by 1992. In addition, by \n1992, the Federal Government employed 124,994 employees to issue and \nenforce regulations--an all-time high.\n  Higher prices and taxes are not the only result of government \nregulation. A recent study done for the U.S. Census Bureau found a \nstrong correlation between regulation and reduced productivity. The \nstudy found that plants with a significant regulatory burden have \nsubstantially lower productivity rates than less regulated plants.\n And that is one of the factors that I think is missing in our balanced \nbudget debate so often, Mr. President.\n\n  We talk about spending. We talk about taxes, as we must and as is \nproper. But we do not talk enough about the need for growth and the \nneed for productivity. Unless we have productivity in this country, \nunless we continue to grow in this country, we will never balance the \nbudget. We will never balance the budget. And in order to have that \ngrowth in productivity we must have investment. In order to have \ninvestment we must have savings. In order to have savings we must get a \nhandle on a ridiculous tax structure that we have in this country. We \nmust get a handle on the national debt. And we must do something about \nthis regulatory burden. It all goes in together and it all finds itself \nin the bottom line of productivity. So we are really talking about a \nbudgetary matter here, in my estimation, as much as anything else.\n  Given all of these statistics, you might assume that President \nClinton would cut back on Federal regulations. This is what the \nAmerican people have been asking for. And, indeed, it is what President \nClinton promised in his National Performance Review. In that review, \nthe President promised to ``end the proliferation of unnecessary and \nunproductive rules.''\n  Instead of keeping that promise, President Clinton and his \nadministration have gone in the opposite direction. For each of the \nfirst 2 years of the Clinton administration, the number of pages of \nactual regulations and notices published in the Federal Register \nexceeded any year since the Carter administration. Despite his \nrhetoric, President Clinton has increased, not decreased, the number of \nregulations.\n  The statistics I have just reviewed make a sufficiently compelling \ncase for regulatory reform. But there is still more evidence to support \nthe case for S. 343. Some of my colleagues have already described many \nexamples of the existing regulations that defy common sense. There are \nmany more stories that could be told. I would only like to add a couple \nto the growing list.\n  One example of regulation gone wild can be found in the Environmental \nProtection Agency's implementation of the Federal Superfund Program. As \nthe Members of this body well know, the Superfund law requires the \ncleanup of some 1,200 toxic waste sites around the Nation. Under this \nprogram, the EPA and private parties have spent billions of dollars \nwith very little to show in the way of results. Few sites have actually \nbeen cleaned up. Of the ones that have been cleaned up, many have been \nrestored to a level of cleanliness that far exceeds any real health \nrisks to humans.\n  A March 21, 1993, article from the New York Times, describes the \nunrealistic level of cleanup EPA required at one site.\n\n       EPA officials said they wanted to make the site safe enough \n     to be used for any purpose--including houses--though no one \n     was propose to build anything there. With that as the agency \n     goal, the agency wanted to make sure children could play in \n     the dirt, even eat it, without risk. And since a chemical in \n     the dirt had been shown to cause cancer in rats, the agency \n     set a limit low enough that a child could eat half a teaspoon \n     of dirt every month for 70 years and not get cancer. Last \n     month, the EPA officials acknowledged that at least half of \n     the $14 billion the nation has spent on Superfund clean-ups \n     was used to comply with similar ``dirt-eating rules,'' as \n     they call them.\n\n  Mr. President, in conclusion, burdensome Federal regulations are also \nimposed on small businesses. Dry cleaners, in particular, must clear a \nlarge number of hurdles just to begin operating. According to the \nNational Federation of Independent Businesses, as of 1991, the Federal \nGovernment required a new dry cleaner to fill out and comply with \nnearly 100 forms and manuals before it could open for business.\n  Yesterday, the Senate approved two important amendments to address \nthe special problems that all small businesses, including dry cleaners, \nface. As amended, S. 343 now requires regulatory agencies to review \nregulations imposed on small entities for cost effectiveness.\n  Mr. President, I think the evidence is clear that our Federal \nregulatory system has become unreasonable and misguided.\n S. 343 will put it back on the right track and, therefore, I urge its \npassage by my colleagues.\n\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The distinguished Senator from Texas.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I am very glad to follow the Senator \nfrom Tennessee. I think he made some very good points, and I think it \nis important that the people of America see some of the things that are \nhappening in this country that we have to fix. The buck stops right \nhere, and only we can do it because we have passed these laws, and the \nregulators have gone far beyond what Congress ever intended.\n  I am the cochair of the Republican Task Force on Regulatory Reform. \nBecause of that, I have heard from literally hundreds of employers, \nfrom Texas as well as small business people all over our country. I \nhave heard dozens of absurd, even silly, examples of the impact of the \nFederal regulatory excess in our daily lives.\n  Senator Hatch from Utah, who has been managing the bill, has started \ntalking about the 10 most absurd regulations of the day. He is now up \nto 20, and I am sure he is going to have 10 more tomorrow, that will \njust make people wonder what in the world is in the water up in \nWashington, DC.\n  It is going to be a good question, and I have a few myself that I \nwant to share, to show the importance of passing this bill, to try to \ntake the harassment off the small business people of our country.\n  The many egregious stories about the enforcement of some of these \nregulations have become legendary, and the people are asking us to say, \n``time out.'' We are not the All Star baseball game tonight, but we \nknow what time out is, at least for baseball, and this time out is to \nget the regulatory train back on the track.\n  Common law has relied on a reasonable person approach. The standard \nbehind our laws should be: What would a reasonable person do under \nthese circumstances? But many of our Federal regulations seem to be \ndesigned to dictate the way in which a person, reasonable or otherwise, \nmust act in every single situation. You know that is impossible. You \ncannot anticipate every single situation that might come up and write a \nregulation to cover that. What happens is you have too many regulations \nand people do not know what is really important. What are the \nregulators going to really enforce? And what is just trying to get to \nsome bit of minutia? We have really taken the reasonableness out of the \nequation, and we have failed to allow for the application of good, old-\nfashioned common sense. For that reason, this debate is dominated by \nexamples of Government out of control.\n  Let me give you a few. They may not rival Senator Hatch's, but these \nare stories that have been related to me. Take the case of a plumbing \ncompany in Dayton, TX, cited for not posting emergency phone numbers at \na construction site. The construction site was three acres of empty \nfield being developed for low-income housing. OSHA shuts the site down \nfor 3 days until the company constructs a freestanding wall in order to \nmeet the OSHA requirement to post emergency phone numbers on a wall.\n  There is a roofing company in San Antonio, TX, cited for not \nproviding \n\n[[Page S 9712]]\ndisposable drinking cups to their workers despite the fact that the \ncompany went to the additional expense of providing sports drinks free \nto their employees in glass containers which the employees in turn used \nfor drinking water. In this case you have a company that went the extra \nmile, went beyond just paper cups and water. They gave them the sports \ndrink because that gets into the bloodstream faster. They did not meet \nthe lesser standard and, therefore, were cited by OSHA.\n  Then there is the case of Mrs. Clay Espy, a rancher from Fort Davis, \nTX. She allowed a student from Texas A to do research on the plants \non her ranch. He discovered a plant which he thought to be endangered \nand reported his finding. The Department of the Interior subsequently \ntold Mrs. Espy that she could no longer graze the cattle on her family \nland. They had been grazing cattle there for over 100 years. But they \nwere afraid that her cattle might eat this weed. Yes; eat the weed. It \ntook a lawsuit and an expenditure of over $10,000 by Mrs. Espy before \nthe Department reversed its ruling and declared that the weed was not, \nin fact, endangered.\n  Even more absurd, if you can believe it, is the Texas small \nbusinessman who happened to have painted his office the day before an \nOSHA inspection, and he was cited for not having a material safety data \nsheet on his half-empty can of Sherwin-Williams paint.\n  Then there is the employer cited at a job site, in which a hot \nroofing kettle was in use, because the job foreman was not wearing a \nlong-sleeved shirt. The foreman was wearing a long-sleeved shirt but he \nrolled up his sleeves between his wrists and his elbows because of the \nweather.\n  Recently OSHA contacted a parent company of a chain of convenience \nstores in Texas threatening to conduct compliance inspection after OSHA \nlearned two employees had gotten into an argument and someone had \nthrown a punch and struck the other. Well, in Texas, that is not a big, \nunusual event, I have to say. But it was unusual to the OSHA \nrepresentative who demanded a complete report of the incident and \nthreatened to follow up with a compliance inspection if the report was \nnot completely satisfactory and timely.\n  Mr. President, these numerous horror stories which have come forward \nsince we began our efforts for regulatory reform provide convincing, I \nhope, evidence of a Government regulatory process that is out of \ncontrol. It demonstrates the need to introduce common sense and \nreasonableness into a system where these qualities seem to be sorely \nlacking.\n  These cases also highlight the way the regulatory excess has been \nallowed to drift into absurdity. When was it decided and by whom that \nthe Federal Government should become the national nanny? Indeed, the \nabsurd is becoming the norm as millions of Americans who operate small \nbusinesses and work for a living know and understand. It is Congress \nthat has refused to acknowledge how long overdue are the fundamental \nreforms that we need to bring common sense into the equation. We must \nrecognize that the Federal Government cannot issue a rule that will fix \nevery problem which involves human behavior.\n  That is why one of the messages sent by the American people in 1992, \nand again in 1994, was, ``We have had enough, and you had better fix \nit.''\n  Mr. President, that is what we are trying to do with this bill. It is \none of the most important pieces of legislation that we will take up \nthis year in the reform that the people asked us to make last year. \nHave we heard the message? That is really the question. I am not sure \nthat everyone in Washington really understands. I am a small business \nperson and I know what it is like to live with the regulations and the \ntaxes that we have put on the small business people of our country.\n  We must reverse this trend. Our Government must be put to the test. \nWe must put our financial house in order, and we must decrease the size \nof the Federal Government and return many of these programs to the \nStates.\n  The 10th amendment says that the Federal Government will have certain \nspecific powers, and everything not specifically reserved to the \nFederal Government will be left to the States and to the people. \nSomehow we have lost track of the 10th amendment, and we aim to get it \nback. And this bill, the Comprehensive Regulatory Reform Act of 1995, \nis one way that we are going to get this country back on track and put \nthe Government that is closest to the people down there in charge and \nto get the Washington bureaucrats--who have never been in small \nbusiness, who really do not understand what it is like to meet a \npayroll, to worry about your employees, to not be sure if you are going \nto be able to feed the families that work for you--we are going to make \nsure that the Federal bureaucrats that do not understand that are no \nlonger in control.\n  If we are going to be able to compete in the global marketplace, we \nhave to change the regulatory environment. We passed this year GATT and \nNAFTA last year. We did that to open markets. We wanted to open free \ntrade in the world so that we would be able to export more. We will \nimport more, too, but we will export more. But we have told American \nbusiness, yes, we are going to give you free trade, but we are going to \nmake you compete with one arm tied behind your back. We are going to \nput so many regulatory excesses on you that we are going to drive up \nthe prices and the costs, and you are not going to be able to compete \nin this global economy that we have created for you.\n  Let us put in perspective just how much this costs the businesses of \nour country. The businesses are the working people. The cost of \ncomplying with current Federal regulations is estimated at between $600 \nand $800 billion a year.\n  That is about the cost of the income tax. Corporate and individual \ntaxes totaled almost $700 billion in 1994. So if you put the stealth \ntax of regulation, $600 to $800 billion a year on top of the income \ntaxes that you pay, you can just double the checks that you wrote on \nApril 15. You can double it because that is the stealth tax, the cost \nof Federal regulatory compliance.\n  We need fundamental change to the current regulatory process. The \nRegulatory Reform Act of 1995 is what will make this happen.\n  Businesses, especially small businesses, are finding it increasingly \ndifficult to exist in this current regulatory environment--the same \nsmall business sector that is the engine of the economic growth of \nAmerica. Government is not the economic engine of America. It is the \nsmall business people of this country that are the economic engine, and \nsometimes they think the Federal Government is trying to keep them from \ngrowing and prospering and creating the new jobs that keep this economy \nvital, so that we can absorb the new people into the system, the young \npeople graduating from college, the immigrants that are coming to our \nshores for new opportunities. We have to make sure that those \nopportunities are there for our future generations.\n  We have the responsibility to make sure that the regulators are doing \nwhat Congress intends for them to do. The Regulatory Reform Act of 1995 \nis the way to restore congressional intent and hopefully, Mr. \nPresident, common sense. That is the mission that we must have this \nyear, so that the people of America know we heard their voices last \nyear and we are going to make the changes, however hard it may be, they \nasked us to make.\n  So, Mr. President, regulatory reform is a very important step that we \nmust take. We must balance the budget. We must have regulatory reform. \nWe must have a fair taxation system. We must not raise taxes, but, in \nfact, we will lower taxes and give the people back the money they \nrightfully earn and should be able to spend for themselves.\n  Mr. President, I thank you for helping us lead this country and do \nthe right thing for the working people who are trying so hard to raise \ntheir families and do a little better for their families than maybe \nthey were able to get as they were growing up.\n  I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/07/11/senate-section/article/S9709-1", "month": "07", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "11", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9713]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n[[Page S 9713]]\n\n\n                 TRIBUTE TO DAVID H. SAWYER--1936-1995\n\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to David H. \nSawyer, a pioneer in the field of political consulting, a brilliant \nanalyst, and a dear friend. David died on July 2, 1995, in New York \nCity. His presence will be sorely missed by all those who knew him.\n  ``A pioneer in the ways to cope with the weaker party machines of the \n1970s,'' according to the New York Times. In an interview he once \ndefined his work this way, ``I don't manipulate voters, because I \ncan't--they're too sophisticated. I'm much more interested in the \nnature of communication itself. How do you create a dialogue with the \nelectorate? How do you control the dynamic of the campaign? Set the \nagenda for discussion? Answer an opponent's charges? Those are my \nissues. You have to get way inside a campaign before you can resolve \nthem, too.''\n  His firm, D.H. Sawyer and Associates, later renamed the Sawyer-Miller \nGroup, took some of the mystery out of how to succeed in today's \ncomplicated electoral process. David brought a dynamic and insightful \napproach to political campaigns. He was able to understand and connect \nwith voters, and to deliver his candidate's message in a simple but \nabsorbing manner. I came to know David during my 1982 re-election \ncampaign, and he has been a loyal and trusted advisor on every campaign \nsince.\n  David helped to open up the governments of Eastern Europe and Latin \nAmerica by introducing mass communication into their electoral \nprocesses. In an interview with the Los Angeles Times he described this \nconcept as ``electronic democracy,'' and went on to say: ``Because of \nmass communications and the legacy of the '60s, people now speak out, \npeople can and will be heard. Eastern Europe in 1989 and 1990 happened \nbecause information had gotten through. What people think about their \ninstitutions is crucial to the institutions' ability to govern.''\n  David leaves his wife, Nell; a son, Luke; two stepsons, Andrew and \nGavin; his mother Mrs. Edward Brewer; his brother Edward; and a sister \nPenny. He will be greatly missed by those who love him.\n  I ask unaminous consent that the full text of the article from the \nNew York Times be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the New York Times, July 4, 1995]\n\n      David H. Sawyer Dies at 59; Innovator in Political Strategy\n\n                           (By David Binder)\n\n       Washington, July 3.--David H. Sawyer, a pioneer in the \n     field of political consulting that burgeoned in the 1970's \n     and 1980's as party machines lost their clout in choosing \n     electoral candidates, died on Sunday in New York Hospital. He \n     was 59 and lived in Manhattan.\n       He had been under treatment for several weeks for a brain \n     tumor, his family said.\n       By 1988, Mr. Sawyer's clients included four Senators, \n     Daniel Patrick Moynihan, John D. Rockefeller 4th, Edward M. \n     Kennedy and John Glenn, six Governors as well as leading \n     politicians in the Philippines and Israel.\n       One notable turnaround engineered by his firm, D. H. Sawyer \n     & Associates (later the Sawyer-Miller Group) was in the 1987 \n     gubernatorial primary in Kentucky, where his client, Wallace \n     Wilkinson, started out with about 5 percent in the polls and \n     went on to win against two strong contenders.\n       Mr. Sawyer based his strategy then and later on polling \n     studies of the electorate. In the case of Kentucky voters, \n     both major opponents of Mr. Wilkinson had advocated tax \n     increases and attacked each other bitterly. In place of \n     higher taxes, the Sawyer-Wilkinson strategy advocated a state \n     lottery.\n       In a 1984 interview for the Inc. Publishing Company, Mr. \n     Sawyer defined his work this way: ``I don't manipulate \n     voters, because I can't--they're too sophisticated. I'm much \n     more interested in the nature of communication itself. How do \n     you create a dialogue with the electorate? How do you control \n     the dynamic of the campaign? Set the agenda for discussion? \n     Answer an opponent's charges? Those are my issues. You have \n     to get way inside a campaign before you can resolve them, \n     too.''\n       A Democrat, Mr. Sawyer worked only for Democratic \n     candidates, but he had no problem dispensing advice to big \n     corporate clients, including Coca-Cola, Apple Computer, \n     Goldman Sachs, Time Warner and Resorts International.\n       Colleagues, headed by Scott Miller, bought out Mr. Sawyer's \n     ownership interest in his firm, which had a staff of 40, in \n     1993. In that same year he opened a political-economic \n     consulting firm called the G.7 Group. By this time there were \n     more than 200 political consulting firms across the country \n     and more than 3,000 people working in the field.\n       David Haskell Sawyer was born June 13, 1936, in Boston. \n     After earning a bachelor of arts degree at Princeton \n     University in 1959, he made documentary films, working in the \n     cinema verite genre with Frederick Wiseman and Richard \n     Leacock. One film dealt with rural poverty in Maine. Another \n     feature, ``Other Voices,'' about mental health patients, was \n     nominated in 1970 for an Academy Award for best documentary. \n     He was drawn into political consulting in the early 1970's in \n     Illinois, where he did some film work for an elected \n     official.\n       He is survived by his wife, the former Nell Michel; a son, \n     Luke, and two stepsons, Andrew and Gavin McFarland, all of \n     New York; his mother, Mrs. Edward Brewer of Hartford; a \n     brother, Edward of Cleveland, and a sister, Penny Sawyer, of \n     New York.\n     \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/07/11/senate-section/article/S9713-1", "month": "07", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "11", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9713]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\nREPORT ON THE EMIGRATION LAWS AND POLICIES OF ROMANIA--MESSAGE FROM THE \n                            PRESIDENT--PM 63\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER laid before the Senate the following message \nfrom the President of the United States, together with an accompanying \nreport; which was referred to the Committee on Finance:\n\nTo the Congress of the United States:\n  On May 19, 1995, I determined and reported to the Congress that \nRomania is in full compliance with the freedom of emigration criteria \nof sections 402 and 409 of the Trade Act of 1974.

A bill to amend the Clean Air Act to extend the primary \nstandard attainment date for moderate ozone nonattainment areas, and \nfor other purposes; to the Committee on Environment and Public Works.\n\n\n        the clean air act moderate non-attainment extension act\n\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I am committed to improving our air \nquality, but we can't expect cities to meet arbitrary deadlines for air \nquality attainment if the EPA is going to hamper rather than help their \nefforts.\n  The EPA required, as part of its enhanced monitoring program, an \nemissions testing system that was expensive, burdensome, and \nineffective. Even though the Clean Air Act itself does not mandate \ncentralized testing, the EPA decided that, to prevent fraud, all cars \nwould have to be tested at a State facility. It cost Texas over $100 \nmillion, but has been found to cause little or no additional reduction \nin emissions.\n  Tests have found auto emissions virtually unchanged when similar \ncentralized programs were initiated in other metropolitan areas. \nDecentralized testing is far less burdensome on drivers; instead of \ncentralized testing at State-supervised facilities, private repair \nstations and remote sensing could be used at far less cost without loss \nof effectiveness.\n  The fewer than 10 percent of the vehicles that account for more than \nhalf of all emissions do not emit the same amount of pollutants from \nday to day. They often escape penalties by failing tests on one day, \nand then passing on the next. Testing should focus on identifying and \nrepairing these vehicles first, and reducing the burden on everyone \nelse.\n  Cities with a high portion of their emissions from cars and trucks--\nsuch as Dallas/Fort Worth in Texas--have been unable to reduce their \nemissions because of the EPA's mishandling of the Clean Air Act's \nautomobile emissions testing requirements. They deserve adequate notice \nof what will be expected; an effective, low-cost, and efficient plan; \nand sufficient time to comply.\n  The choice by the 1990 Clean Air Act Amendments of a 1996 attainment \ndate for moderate areas requires attainment before implementation plans \ncan be put in place, and air quality improvements shown. Today I am \nintroducing a bill to give moderate nonattainment 2 additional years to \nmeet the attainment date for air quality.\n  An extension of the deadline gives Dallas/Fort Worth, and other \nmoderate nonattainment areas throughout the United States, a chance to \nprove themselves without being reclassified as serious non-attainment \nareas. It will give cities time to implement plans next year and still \nhave 2 more years to meet the 3-consecutive-year requirement for air \nquality attainment. The 2-year extension also will give the EPA time to \noverhaul its Clean Air Act automobile inspection and maintenance \nprogram and administer it fairly across the country.\n  Dallas/Fort Worth has worked hard to improve its air quality, as I am \nsure other moderate nonattainment cities have, too. With the exception \nof enhanced monitoring, Dallas/Fort Worth has improved air quality; \nalmost half of the 145 tons per day emission reduction requirement to \nachieve attainment under the computer model are in place today. Many of \nthe largest employers have implemented voluntary employee trip \nreduction programs. In order to provide moderate areas with the \nflexibility necessary for the proper \n\n[[Page S 9718]]\nimplementation of the Clean Air Act, and to take into account Federal \nmistakes in administering this program, I urge the Senate to enact this \nchange as soon as possible.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. FEINGOLD (for himself, Mr. Bradley, and Mr. Wellstone):\n  S. 1022. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to \neliminate the percentage depletion allowance for certain minerals, and \nfor other purposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n           elimination of the percentage depletion allowance\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce S. 1022, \nlegislation to eliminate percentage depletion allowances for four mined \nsubstances--asbestos, lead, mercury, and uranium--from the Federal Tax \nCode. This measure is based on language passed as part of the Energy \nPolicy Act of 1992 by the other body during the 102d Congress. I am \njoined in introducing this legislation by my colleague from New Jersey, \nMr. Bradley, and my colleague from Minnesota, Mr. Wellstone.\n  Analysis by the Joint Committee on Taxation on the similar \nlegislation that passed the House estimated that, under that bill, \nincome to the Federal Treasury from the elimination of percentage \ndepletion allowances in just these four mined commodities would total \n$83 million over 5 years, $20 million in this year alone. These savings \nare calculated as the excess amount of Federal revenues above what \nwould be collected if depletion allowances were limited to sunk costs \nin capital investments. These four allowances are only a few of the \npercentage depletion allowances contained in the Tax Code for extracted \nfuel, minerals, metal, and other mined commodities--with a combined \nvalue, according to 1994 estimates by the Joint Committee on Taxation, \nof $4.8 billion.\n  Mr. President, these percentage depletion allowances were initiated \nby the Corporation Excise Act of 1909. Provisions for a depletion \nallowance based on the value of the mine were made under a 1912 \nTreasury Department regulation, but difficulty in applying this \naccounting principle to mineral production led to the initial \ncodification of the mineral depletion allowance in the Tariff Act of \n1913. The Revenue Act of 1926 established percentage depletion much in \nits present form for oil and gas. The percentage depletion allowance \nwas then extended to metal mines, coal, and other hardrock minerals by \nthe Revenue Act of 1932, and has been adjusted several times since.\n  Percentage depletion allowances were historically placed in the Tax \nCode to reduce the effective tax rates in the mineral and extraction \nindustries far below tax rates on other industries, providing \nincentives to increase investment, exploration, and output. However, \npercentage depletion also makes it possible to recover many times the \namount of the original investment.\n  There are two methods of calculating a deduction to allow a firm to \nrecover the costs of their capital investment: cost\n depletion, and percentage depletion. Cost depletion allows for the \nrecovery of the actual capital investment--the costs of discovering, \npurchasing, and developing a mineral reserve--over the period which the \nreserve produces income. Using cost depletion, a company would deduct a \nportion of their original capital investment minus any previous \ndeductions, in an amount that is equal to the fraction of the remaining \nrecoverable reserves. Under this method, the total deductions cannot \nexceed the original capital investment.\n\n  However, under percentage depletion, the deduction for recovery of a \ncompany's investment is a fixed percentage of gross income--namely, \nsales revenue--from the sale of the mineral. Under this method, total \ndeductions typically exceed, let me be clear on that point, Mr. \nPresident, exceed the capital that the company invested.\n  The rates for percentage depletion are quite significant. Section 613 \nof the United States Code contains depletion allowances for more than \n70 metals and minerals, at rates ranging from 10 to 22 percent--which \nis the rate used for all uranium and domestic deposits of asbestos, \nlead, and mercury. Lead and mercury produced outside of the United \nStates are eligible for a percentage depletion at a rate of 14 percent. \nAsbestos produced in other countries by U.S. companies is eligible for \na 10-percent allowance.\n  Mr. President, in today's budget climate we are faced with the \nquestion of who should bear the costs of exploration, development, and \nproduction of natural resources: all taxpayers, or the users and \nproducers of the resource? Given that we face significant budget \ndeficits, these subsidies are simply a tax expenditure that raise the \ndeficit for all citizens or shift a greater tax burden to other \ntaxpayers to compensate for the special tax breaks provided to some \nindustries.\n  Mr. President, the measure I am introducing, despite the fact that \ntaxes seem complicated, is fairly straightforward. It eliminates the \npercentage depletion allowance for asbestos, lead, mercury, and uranium \nwhile continuing to allow companies to recover reasonable cost \ndepletion.\n  Though at one time there may have been an appropriate role for a \nGovernment-driven incentives for enhanced mineral production, there is \nnow a sufficiently large budget deficit which justifies a more \nreasonable depletion allowance that is consistent with those given to \nother businesses.\n  Moreover, Mr. President, these four commodities covered by my bill \nare among some of the most environmentally adverse. The percentage \ndepletion allowance makes a mockery of conservation efforts. The \nsubsidy effectively encourages mining regardless of the true economic \nvalue of the resource. The effects of such mines on U.S. lands, both \npublic and private, has been significant--with tailings piles, scarred \nearth, toxic byproducts, and disturbed habitats to prove it.\n  Ironically, as my earlier description highlights, the more toxic the \ncommodity, the greater the percentage depletion received by the \nproducer. Mercury, lead, uranium, and asbestos receive the highest\n percentage depletion allowance, while less toxic substances receive \nlower rates.\n\n  Particularly in the case of the four commodities covered by my bill, \nthese tax breaks create absurd contradictions in Government policy. The \nbulk of the tax break shared by these four commodities goes to support \nlead production. Federal public health and environmental agencies are \nstruggling to come to grips with a vast children's health crisis caused \nby lead poisoning. Nearly 9 percent of U.S. preschoolers, 1.7 million \nchildren, have levels of lead in their blood higher than the generally \naccepted safety standard. Federal agencies spend millions each year to \nprevent lead poisoning, test young children, and research solutions. At \nthe same time, the percentage depletion allowance subsidizes the mining \nof lead with a 22-percent depletion allowance. Lest we think that our \nnearly 15-year-old ban on lead in paint, or the end of the widespread \nuse of lead in gasoline has solved our lead problems, exposure problems \nstill exist. In 1993, 390 million tons of lead were produced in this \ncountry, with a value of $275 million, according to the U.S. Bureau of \nMines. Some 82 percent of the production came from 29 plants with \nannual capacities of more than 6,000 tons. There continue to be major \nuses of lead in the production of storage batteries, gasoline additives \nand other chemicals, ammunition, and solder. Even more ironic, Mr. \nPresident, though the recovery and recycling of lead from scrap \nbatteries was approximately 780 tons--twice the newly mined \nproduction--the recycling industry received no such tax subsidy.\n  To cite another example, hardly any individual in this body has not \nbeen acutely aware of the public health problem posed by asbestos. \nThese compounds were extensively used in building trades and have \nresulted in tens of thousands of cases of lung cancer and fibrous \ndisease in asbestos workers. As many as 15 million school children and \n3 million school workers have the potential to be exposed because of \nthe installation of asbestos containing materials in public buildings \nbetween 1945 and 1978. The EPA has already banned the use of asbestos \nin many building and flame retardant products, and will phase out all \nother uses over the next 5 years. Asbestos fibers are released at all \nstages of mining, use, and disposal of asbestos products. The EPA \nestimates that approximately 700 tons per year are released into the \nair during \n\n[[Page S 9719]]\nmining and milling operations. It certainly seems quite peculiar to \nthis Senator, that a commodity, the use of which the Federal Government \nwill effectively ban before the year 2000, continues to receive a \nhearty tax subsidy.\n  Mr. President, the time has come for the Federal Government to get of \nthe business of subsidizing business in ways it can no longer afford--\nboth financially and for the health of its citizens. This legislation \nis one step in that direction.\n  Mr. President, in our efforts to reduce the Federal deficit and \nachieve a balanced budget, it is critical that we look at tax \nexpenditures that provide special subsidies to particular groups, such \nas those proposed to be eliminated in this legislation. Tax \nexpenditures are among the fastest growing parts of the Federal\n budget. According to the General Accounting Office, these tax \nexpenditures already account for some $400 billion each year. GAO has \nrecommended that Congress begin scrutinizing these areas of the budget \nas closely as we do direct spending programs. Earlier this year, the \nSenator from Minnesota [Mr. Wellstone] and I introduced a sense-of-the-\nSenate resolution calling for imposing the same kind of fiscal \ndiscipline in the area of tax expenditures that we do for other areas \nof the Federal budget, an issue that the Senator from New Jersey [Mr. \nBradley] has championed for some time as well. I am particularly \npleased to have the Senator from New Jersey and the Senator from \nMinnesota join me in this effort today. As GAO noted in its report last \nyear, ``Tax Policy: Tax Expenditures Deserve More Scrutiny'', many of \nthese special tax provisions are never subjected to reauthorization or \nany type of systematic review. Once enacted, they become enshrined in \nthe Tax Codes and are difficult to dislodge.\n\n  Of the 124 tax expenditures identified by the Joint Tax Committee in \n1993, about half were enacted before 1950--nearly half a century ago. \nClearly, in this case, the economic conditions which may have once \njustified a special tax subsidy have dramatically changed. Eliminating \nthese kinds of special tax preferences is long overdue.\n  Mr. President, in 1992 I developed an 82+point plan to eliminate the \nFederal deficit and have continued to work on implementation of the \nelements of that plan since that time. Elimination of special tax \npreferences for mining companies was part of that 82-plus-point plan. \nAchievement of a balanced budget will require that these kinds of \nspecial taxpayer subsidies to particular industries must be curtailed, \njust as many direct spending programs are being cut back.\n  Finally, Mr. President, in conclusion I want to pay tribute to \nseveral elected officials from Milwaukee, Mayor John Norquist, State \nRepresentative Spencer Coggs, and Milwaukee Alderman Michael Murphy, \nwho have brought to my attention the incongruity of the Federal \nGovernment continuing to provide taxpayer subsidies for the production \nof toxic substances like lead while our inner cities are struggling to \nremove lead-based paint from older homes and buildings where children \nmay be exposed to this hazardous material. I deeply appreciate their \nsupport and encouragement for my efforts in this area.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a copy of the legislation \nbe printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n                                S. 1022\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. CERTAIN MINERALS NOT ELIGIBLE FOR PERCENTAGE \n                   DEPLETION.\n\n       (A) General Rule.--\n       (1) Paragraph (1) of section 613(b) of the Internal Revenue \n     Code of 1986 (relating to percentage depletion rates) is \n     amended--\n       (A) by striking ``and uranium'' in subparagraph (A), and\n       (B) by striking ``asbestos,'', ``lead,'', and ``mercury,'' \n     in subparagraph (B).\n       (2) Subparagraph (A) of section 613(b)(3) of such Code is \n     amended by inserting ``other than lead, mercury, or uranium'' \n     after ``metal mines''.\n       (3) Paragraph (4) of section 613(b) of such Code is amended \n     by striking ``asbestos (if paragraph (1)(B) does not \n     apply),''.\n       (4) Paragraph (7) of section 613(b) of such Code is amended \n     by striking ``or'' at the end of subparagraph (B), by \n     striking the period at the end of subparagraph (C) and \n     inserting ``, or'', and by inserting after subparagraph (C) \n     the following new subparagraph:\n       ``(D) mercury, uranium, lead, and asbestos.''\n       (b) Conforming Amendments.--Subparagraph (D) of section \n     613(c)(4) of such Code is amended by striking ``lead,'' and \n     ``uranium,''.\n       (c) Effective Date.--The amendments made by this section \n     shall apply to taxable years beginning after December 31, \n     1995.\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I am very pleased to be able today to \nspeak on behalf of the bill that the distinguished Senator from \nWisconsin has introduced and that I am co-sponsoring; a bill that I \nbelieve takes a crucial step toward returning some standard of fairness \nto our Nation's Tax Code.\n  Mr. President, I believe I can speak for a large majority of middle-\nincome families in this country when I say that there are major \nproblems with our tax system. When the American people send their \nchecks to Washington every April 15, they want to know that their money \nis being used wisely and that everyone in the country is carrying his \nor her share of the load. They want to know that just because they \ndon't have their own personal lobbyist up on the Hill and that there is \na standard of basic economic fairness that is applied in our tax \nsystem--that the superwealthy can and should pay more than those who \nare struggling.\n  But the American people are angry--they are angry at Washington \nbecause they feel in their hearts that there is no\n standard of fairness being applied in our tax system anymore. And do \nyou know what Mr. President? They are right. Over the years our \nnational Tax Code has become riddled with corporate tax breaks, \nloopholes, and outright giveaways, costing the Federal Government over \n$400 billion each year; Mr. President--talk about the gift that keeps \non giving. These are tax dollars that we forego--money that has to be \nmade up somewhere, and all too often ends up costing American families \nof modest means even more.\n\n  These tax loopholes and corporate giveaways are like trying to fill \nup a bucket with water, but the bucket has hundreds of holes that let \nthe water dribble out from every corner. You can turn on the spigot and \nput more and more and more water into the bucket, but until the holes \nare plugged you'll never keep the water where it belongs.\n  That's what this bill does; it begins to plug some of the tax holes. \nThis bill removes a special tax break that only a very few businesses \nhave in this country--companies that mine lead, mercury, uranium, and \nasbestos. It's called the special percentage depletion allowance, and \nit allows mining companies to deduct 22 percent of their profits from \ntheir income each and every year for each and every mine they operate. \nTwenty-two percent, Mr. President. Now I know of lots of small business \noperators in Minnesota who would love to have that kind of special \nallowance for their business--but they don't have it. Those who mine \nthese minerals have it.\n  A twenty-two percent tax break--and for what? So miners can dig \nhazardous heavy metals like lead and mercury out of the ground? Do we \ngive tax breaks to companies that take these dangerous metals out of \nour environment and recycle them? Why are we giving a tax break to \ncompanies that mine asbestos to encourage them to dig more out of the \nground when in just a few years the use of asbestos will be banned \naltogether? Why give a 22-percent tax credit to a company that mines \nuranium and not to a company that produces ethanol, or solar panels, or \ngeothermal power?\n  Mr. President, this 22-percent tax deduction is not free--it costs \nthe American public. The Joint Committee on Taxation said that \neliminating this deduction for these minerals would save the Government \n$83 million over the next 5 years. If corporations do not pay their \nfair share of taxes, middle-class people have to pay more; the American \npublic is in effect underwriting this tax dodge for these companies. \nThat is not right, it is not fair, and it should be stopped.\n  This bill takes a bold step, and I applaud its author, my good friend \nthe distinguished Senator from Wisconsin for bringing it to the floor. \nAnd, I would say to the people of this country, and to my colleagues, \nthat I see this bill as a beginning. I hope it will be the beginning of \nan all-out effort to reform what I and others have called \n\n[[Page S 9720]]\ncorporate entitlements; an effort to cut back on what are spending \nprograms by fiat, programs that, unlike regular spending programs, \nnever come up for review in Congress or by the public at large. It is \nan effort to return some standard of fairness to our tax system, and \nrebalance the tax scales to ensure that corporations will pay more of \ntheir fair share--and the American public will no longer be forced to \nunderwrite multinational corporations.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url":

Mr. President, I rise today in support of \ncontinuing the funding for the Office of Technology Assessment [OTA] of \nthe U.S. Congress. I believe that if more of my distinguished \ncolleagues, as well as the public, knew what the elimination of the OTA \nwould mean to our deliberative processes, they, too, would support this \ninvaluable congressional resource.\n  Mr. President, there is considerable dedication among my colleagues \nto reduce the Federal budget deficit and to streamline Federal \nagencies. This Congress deserves to be commended for bringing the \nbudget deficit, and its burden on future generations, to the attention \nof the American people more dramatically than ever before. I, too, \nsupport the reduction of Federal spending, but only where it makes good \nsense to do so.\n  However, I ask, what positive affect will the elimination of the \nOTA--a 143-person, $20 million-a-year agency that performs a great \nservice to the Congress and that potentially saves billions of \ndollars--have on reducing the budget deficit?\n  Mr. President, many of my colleagues know that the OTA does valuable \nwork and that it is well-managed. However, some argue that the OTA is a \nluxury that the Congress and the country can no longer afford. Mr. \nPresident, I submit that the OTA is not an indulgence, but rather a \nnecessity for the Congress and the Nation.\n  I have frequently turned to the OTA for analysis and information. For \nexample, in 1986, the OTA provided an invaluable service to the \nCongress and the American Indian community by taking an unprecedented \nin-depth look at native American health and health care. We learned an \nenormous amount about both the inadequacies of information technology \nand the health care delivery systems in the Federal agencies that are \ncharged with implementing our nation-to-nation treaty agreements. As a \nresult of the OTA's study, the Congress will now enjoy a much higher \ndegree of accuracy in reports on the status of Indian health.\n  Let me give you another example of how the OTA has responded to my \nrequests to deliver impartial information. I was one of the first \nprimary requesters of Adolescent Health--OTA, 1991--the first extensive \nnational examination of the scientific evidence on the efficacy of \nprevention and treatment interventions directed toward improving the \nhealth of our Nation's adolescent population. The OTA clearly gave the \nauthorizing and appropriating committees the message that we should not \ntrick ourselves into thinking that by simply labeling Federal \ninitiatives as ``prevention'' of adolescent substance abuse,\n delinquency, AIDS, or pregnancy, the programs were effective. In fact, \nmany of us on both sides of the aisle were disturbed when the OTA \nconcluded that there was very little evidence of success from the \nprevention efforts that we had promoted. However, the requesters soon \ncame to realize how valuable it was to receive an open-minded and \nimpartial review from the OTA. And, as the OTA was charged to do, its \nreport went well beyond just giving us the bad news. Because its role \nis to provide useful information to the Congress, the OTA provided \nsufficient analysis for us to see where our federally funded prevention \nefforts were going wrong, and provided guidance to the executive branch \non how to better target Federal dollars for adolescent health.\n\n  I can give you numerous other examples of the OTA's rigorous approach \nin winnowing through cloudy data in order to provide us with \ninformation that is both accurate and useful. For example, since the \nlate 1970's, the OTA has been an often lonely voice in the health care \nwilderness, carefully assessing whether the country is investing \nsufficiently in evidence-gathering on health care treatments. Valid \ninformation about what works and what doesn't work is critical to the \npublic and private sectors of the health care industry, which \nrepresents one-seventh of the Nation's gross domestic product. Senators \nand staffers need this information as they consider budget requests \nfrom the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, including the \nupcoming reauthorization for the National Institutes of Health, and \nproposed reforms to Medicaid, Medicare, and the private insurance \nmarket. For example, policymakers need to know the extent to which \nconsumers have sufficient information to choose insurance plans, health \nfacilities and individual treatments. Just recently, the OTA, re-\nexamined how we know what works by looking at new health assessment \ntechnologies--OTA, Identifying Health Technologies That Work: Searching \nfor Evidence, September 1994. I recommend that report to all of my \ncolleagues and to their constituents in the health care business.\n  As another example, a health technology study by the OTA in December \n1988, Nurse Practitioners, Physician Assistants, and Certified Nurse \nMidwives: A Policy Analysis, concluded that nonphysician providers were \n``especially valuable in improving access to primary and supplemental \ncare in rural areas and * * * for the poor, minorities and people \nwithout insurance.'' This information was very helpful in developing \nhealth care systems enhanced by the utilization of nonphysician care \nproviders for our underserved populations.\n  Similar, hard-hitting, tell-it-like-it-is analyses have been done by \nthe OTA on subjects ranging from ground water to space. These include \nclassic assessments of polygraph testing, DNA analysis, police body \narmor, seismic verification of nuclear test ban treaties and other work \non weapons of mass destruction, and on risk assessment methods, all of \nwhich were greeted with accolades from Members. Right now, the OTA has \nwork under way in areas as important and diverse as \n\n[[Page S 9723]]\nearthquake damage prevention, advanced\n automotive technologies, renewable energy, wireless communications, \nand Arctic impacts of Soviet nuclear contamination.\n\n  Some of my colleagues have suggested that we don't need an OTA--that \nis, our own group of experts in the legislative branch capable of \nproviding us with these highly technical analyses needed for developing \nlegislation. How many of us are able to fully grasp and synthesize \nhighly scientific information and identify the relevant questions that \nneed to be addressed?\n   The OTA was created to provide the Congress with its own source of \ninformation on highly technical matters. Who else but a scientifically \noriented agency, composed of technical experts, governed by a \nbipartisan board of congressional overseers, and seeking information \ndirectly under congressional auspices, and given the Congress and the \ncountry accurate and essential information on new technologies?\n  Can other congressional support agencies and staff provide the \ninformation we need? I am second to none in my high regard for these \nagencies, but each has its own distinct role. The U.S. General \nAccounting Office is in effective organization of auditors and \naccountants, not scientists. The Congressional Research Service is busy \nresponding to the requests of members for information and research. The \nCongressional Budget Office provides the Congress with budget data and \nwith analyses of alternative fiscal and budgetary impacts of \nlegislation. Furthermore, each of these agencies is likely to have its \nbudget reduced, or to be asked to take on more responsibilities, or \nboth, and would find it extremely difficult to take on the kinds of \nspecialized work that OTA has contributed.\n  I hope that the Congress does not become a body that ignores common \nsense. If it is to remain the world's greatest deliberative body--\npossible only because of access to the best and most accurate and \nimpartial information and analysis--the Congress must retain the \nOTA.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/07/11/senate-section/article/S9722-1", "month": "07", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "11", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9723]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n     ERRATA IN CONFERENCE REPORT ON HOUSE CONCURRENT RESOLUTION 67\n\n Mr. DOMENICI.

Mr. President, I support the President's decision \ntoday to restore full diplomatic relations with Vietnam. This would not \nbe an easy decision for any President to make. President Clinton has \nshown courage and honor in his resolve to do so.\n  President Clinton, like Presidents Bush and Reagan before him, took \nvery seriously his pledge to the American people that the first \npriority in our relationship with Vietnam would be the accounting for \nAmericans missing in action in Vietnam.\n  Given the importance of that commitment, President Clinton insisted \nthat Vietnam cooperate with our accounting efforts to such an extent \nthat normalization was clearly justified and that tangible progress \ntoward the fullest possible accounting be clear enough to assure us \nthat the prospects for continued cooperation were excellent.\n  Vietnam has shown that level of cooperation. The President has kept \nhis commitment. Normalizing relations with our former enemy is the \nright thing to do.\n  In 1991, President Bush proposed a roadmap for improving our \nrelations with Vietnam. Under its provisions, Vietnam was required to \ntake unilateral, bilateral, and multilateral steps to help us account \nfor our missing. Vietnam's cooperation has been excellent for some time \nnow, and has increased since the President lifted our trade embargo \nagainst Vietnam in 1994.\n  That view is shared by virtually every American official, military \nand civilian, involved in the accounting process, from the commander in \nchief of U.S. Forces in the Pacific to the enlisted man excavating \ncrash sites in remote Vietnamese jungles. It is also shared by Gen. \nJohn Vessey who served three Presidents as Special Emissary to Vietnam \nfor POW/MIA Affairs, as capable and honorable a man as has ever worn \nthe uniform of the United States.\n  It is mostly my faith in the service of these good men and women that \nhas convinced me that Vietnam's cooperation warrants the normalization \nof our relations under the terms of the roadmap. It would be injurious \nto the credibility of the United States and beneath the dignity of a \ngreat nation to evade commitments which we freely undertook.\n  I should also note that Adm. Jeremiah Denton, my acting senior \nranking officer at the Hanoi Hilton and a courageous resister, as well \nas my dear friend Ev Alvarez, the longest held POW in Vietnam, join me \nand many other former POW's in supporting the restoration of diplomatic \nrelations.\n  Other factors make the case for full diplomatic relations even \nstronger. Increasingly, the United States and Vietnam have a shared \nstrategic concern that can be better addressed by an improvement in our \nrelations.\n  I am not advocating the containment of China. Nor do I think such an \nambitious and complex strategic goal could be achieved simply by \nnormalizing relations with Vietnam. But Vietnam, which will become a \nfull member of ASEAN later this month, is an increasingly responsible \nplayer in Southeast Asian affairs. An economically viable Vietnam, \nacting in concert with its neighbors, will help the region resist \ndominance by any one power. That is a development which is clearly in \nthe best interests of the United States.\n  Human rights progress in Vietnam should also be better served by \nrestoring relations with that country. The Vietnamese have already \ndeveloped complex relations with the rest of the free world. Instead of \nvainly trying to isolate Vietnam, the United States should test the \nproposition that greater exposure to Americans will render Vietnam more \nsusceptible to the influence of our values.\n  Vietnam's human rights record needs substantial improvement. We \nshould \n\n[[Page S 9724]]\nmake good use of better relations with the Vietnamese to help advance \nin that country a decent respect for the rights of man.\n  Finally, the people of Arizona expect me to act in the best interests \nof the Nation. We have looked back in anger at Vietnam for too long. I \ncannot allow whatever resentments I incurred during my time in Vietnam \nto hold me from doing what is so clearly my duty. I believe it is my \nduty to encourage this country to build from the losses and the hopes \nof our tragic war in Vietnam a better peace for both the American and \nthe Vietnamese people. By his action today, the President has helped \nbring us closer to that worthy goal. I strongly commend him for having \ndone so.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/07/11/senate-section/article/S9723-3", "month": "07", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "11", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9724]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                            THE HIGHWAY BILL\n\n Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I want to take a few months to \nexplain several of my votes concerning S. 440, the highway bill. I \nvoted in favor of final passage of the bill because it would meet \nFederal transportation responsibilities while returning to the States \nmuch of their rightful authority to manage their own roadways.\n  Many of the amendments offered to the bill concerned the question of \nwhether the States should be required to enact various highway safety \nlaws. Although the debate on these amendments focused to a large extent \non the wisdom of the safety laws at issue, my votes on the amendments \nturned more on the threshold question of whether the States should \nretain the power to decide for themselves whether to enact those laws. \nAs a general matter, I think the Federal Government should decide only \nthose issues that, by their very nature, demand a uniform resolution \nthroughout the Nation. On issues like these, a resolution of the issue \nat the State level would itself be harmful, no matter how wisely the \nState legislatures exercise their power. National defense is one such \nexample; the need for central direction and economies of scale preclude \na satisfactory resolution of the issue at the State level. But our laws \nin other areas should in the main be left to the discretion of the \nStates, so that they can be tailored to the respective circumstances \nand values prevalent in each State.\n  These principles led me to oppose the Reid amendment to set a \nnational speed limit for trucks, the Lautenberg amendment to set a \nnational speed limit for all motor vehicles, and the Dorgan amendment \nto prohibit open containers of alcohol in motor vehicles. They likewise \nexplain my support for the Smith amendment to repeal Federal seatbelt \nand motorcycle helmet law mandates, and the Snowe amendment to repeal \nthe Federal motorcycle-helmet law mandate. None of these issues demands \na single resolution across the Nation. I further note that my home \nState of Michigan already has a seatbelt law, which only underscores \nthe fact that my votes on these amendments turned not on my views as to \nwhether States should have seatbelt and helmet laws, but rather on my \nbelief that States ought to be able to decide these issues for \nthemselves.\n  Similarly, I opposed the Hutchinson amendment to retain the Federal \nmotorcycle-helmet law mandate with respect to States that do not assume \nthe cost of treating injuries attributable to a person's failure to \nwear a helmet while riding a motorcycle. This amendment was presented \nas an attempt to marry States' responsibility with States' rights. And \nit is true that the Federal Government assumes certain medical costs \nthrough its Medicaid and Medicare programs. But that does not mean the \nFederal Government should be able to mandate motorcycle-helmet laws. \nFor if it did, the Federal Government could likewise mandate laws \nprohibiting other activities--say, smoking or mountain climbing--that \ninvolve an appreciable risk of physical harm. The Hutchison amendment \nin fact would have been a Trojan Horse for increasing the power of the \nFederal Government at the expense of not only the prerogatives of the \nStates, but also of the liberties of the people.\n  My support of the Byrd amendment to encourage a national blood-\nalcohol standard for minor drivers was bottomed on these same \nprinciples. No one argues that kids should be able to drink and drive. \nTo the contrary, everyone agrees that teenage drinking and driving is a \ndanger that must be addressed. When there is this kind of overwhelming \nnational consensus with respect to an issue, the question of whether \nthe issue should be decided at the State level in fact becomes merely \ntheoretical. Under these circumstances, the existence of a Federal rule \nis not likely to frustrate the desire of a State to enact a contrary \nrule. Such is the case with teenage drinking and driving. In cases like \nthese, the practical, administrative benefits of a uniform Federal rule \noutweigh theoretical concerns related to federalism.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/07/11/senate-section/article/S9724-1", "month": "07", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "11", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9724]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n     THE 125th ANNIVERSARY OF LIBRARY OF CONGRESS COPYRIGHT SERVICE\n\n Mr. HATFIELD. Mr. President, as Chairman of the Joint \nCommittee on the Library of Congress, it is my pleasure to acknowledge \nthe 125th anniversary of the statute which centralized our Nation's \ncopyright registration and deposit system in the Library. This law, \nsigned by President Ulysses S. Grant on July 8, 1870, was the single \nmost important factor in ensuring that Congress' library would \neventually become the Nation's library and, in fact, the greatest \nrepository of knowledge in the world.\n  Today, Dr. James Billington, our Librarian of Congress, will \nrecognize the role of the copyright in building the Library's \nunsurpassed collection over the past 125 years in a program being held \nin the Jefferson Building's Great Hall. I join with Dr. Billington in \ncelebrating the anniversary of this important statute.\n  The act required both that all works be registered in the Library and \nthat the Library be the repository of these copies. The Library could \nhold the copy of the work as a record of the copyright registration, \nbut it also had the opportunity to make the work available as a \nresource for others. The joining of copyright and the Library was, and \ncontinues to be, a mutually beneficial arrangement. Then-Librarian of \nCongress Ainsworth Spofford believed that bringing copyright to the \nLibrary could help it become a great library, and he strongly urged \npassage of the 1870 legislation. However, I think even he could not \nhave foreseen that the Library of Congress would become the great \ninstitution it is today.\n  It is hard to overemphasize the importance of copyright deposits to \nthe collections of the Library and the resulting growth of the \ninstitution. Within a decade after the 1870 statute, the Library's \ncollections tripled. When foreign works were granted U.S. copyright \nprotection in 1891, many works from other countries were brought into \nthe Library through copyright deposit.\n  Among the works the Library has received through copyright deposit \nare: the first edition of a Dvorak opera; an unpublished composition by \nthe 14 year-old Aaron Copland; all the network news programs since the \n1960's; rare performances by artists such as Martha Graham captured on \nvideotape; and important Civil War and Spanish-American War \nphotographs.\n  The importance of the copyright deposits to the Library continues \ntoday. Some of the Library's most heavily used collections, such as the \nlocal history and genealogy collection, would hardly exist were it not \nfor copyright deposit. In fiscal year 1994, the value of works received \nthrough copyright deposit was estimated at more than $15 million. The \nacquisition of these works could not have been accomplished through \npurchasing and gifts.\n  Mr. President, the Library of Congress provides valuable and unique \nservices to the Congress and the Nation. Copyright continues to play an \nimportant role in the Library's work and I once again join in \ncommemorating the 125th anniversary of the act which brought our \nnational copyright system to the Library of Congress.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/07/11/senate-section/article/S9724-2", "month": "07", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "11", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9724-S9725]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n              RESTORING DIPLOMATIC RELATIONS WITH VIETNAM\n\n Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I feel that it is important that \nthe Members of this Chamber move history forward and support the \nPresident's decision to normalize diplomatic relations with Vietnam.\n  Over the last 17 months, the Vietnamese Government has helped to \nresolve many cases of Americans who \n\n[[Page S 9725]]\nwere missing in action or held as prisoners of war. I strongly feel \nthat our responsibility to the families of courageous, patriotic \nAmericans who fought in the Vietnam conflict, and who are still \nmissing, will never end until the status of their fate is resolved.\n  But important progress is being made. As President Clinton stated \nthis afternoon, 29 families have received the remains of their loved \nones with the assistance of the Vietnamese Government. Important \ndocuments have been passed on to our Government to help shed light on \nthe fate of other missing Americans. And the number of discrepancy \ncases of Americans thought to be alive after they were lost has been \nreduced to 55.\n  Mr. President, we must continue serious efforts to secure information \nabout our lost soldiers, and this effort can be greatly enhanced by \ncoordinating and working with the Vietnamese Government and its people. \nNormalizing relations will help our cause and further our national \ninterest.\n  Mr. President, those who have argued against normalization seem more \ncomfortable with the past and have little vision of the future. We were \nengaged in serious conflict in Vietnam, and much of our military \npresence in Asia derived from the needs and requirements of that \nconflict. But who has benefited from American sacrifice? Not many in \nthis country.\n  Japan has just emerged as the largest foreign investor in Vietnam. \nDuring the first half of this year, Japan won 30 major infrastructure \nprojects worth $755 million. Of Vietnam's intake of $3.58 billion for \nthese first 6 months, Taiwan, South Korea, and Singapore followed \nbehind Japan in investment. The United States ranked sixth in this \nmajor new growth market in the Asia Pacific region.\n  Although the United States dropped its trade embargo with Vietnam \nlast year, America's failure to restore diplomatic relations has meant \nthat the Ex-Im Bank could not finance trade, that the Overseas Private \nInvestment Corporation could not insure American firms' commerce with \nVietnam, and that our Nation could not develop trade treaties with what \nmany consider to be the most important, new, big-emerging market. \nWithout the ability to establish a treaty and grant MFN status with \nVietnam, it is unlikely that the Vietnamese will earn money to purchase \nAmerican products.\n  Mr. President, last year in the Washington Post, Alan Tonelson of the \nEconomic Strategy Institute wrote about a 104-page Mitsubishi Corp. \nreport entitled: ``Master Plan for the Automobile Industry in \nVietnam.'' He noted that this Japanese trading firm had already \norganized its efforts and meticulously established a framework to build \na Vietnamese automotive industry, dependent on Japanese support. For \nonce, America needs to get ahead of the curve, to support U.S. firms \nentering new markets, instead of having to elbow in after others have \nwrapped up the market.\n  Mr. President, America--more than any other nation in the Asian \nregion--should be the beneficiary of Vietnam's economic development. We \nhave an important duty to determine the fate of our lost and missing. \nBut this effort will best be served by restoring diplomatic relations \nand recognizing Vietnam's Government. We must understand that our \nnational economic interests are eroding each day that we allow other \ncountries to push forward into this emerging economy and leave U.S. \nfirms and American workers behind.\n  The time has come, Mr. President, for us to engage Vietnam and to \nbuild a future with this Government and its people that helps us deal \nwith our wounds and helps our citizens into a new era.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/07/11/senate-section/article/S9724-3", "month": "07", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "11", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9725]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n      REMOVAL OF INJUNCTION OF SECRECY--TREATY DOCUMENT NO. 104-14\n\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON.
