Mr. President, I am very pleased that the conference on \nthe National Highway System bill has reached agreement on the National \nHighway System Designation Act of 1995. I am prepared to move to that \nnow.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will report the conference \nreport.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The committee on conference on the disagreeing votes of the \n     two Houses on the amendments of the House to the bill (S. \n     440) to amend title 23, United States Code, to provide for \n     the designation of the National Highway System, and for other \n     purposes, having met, after full and free conference, have \n     agreed to recommend and do recommend to their respective \n     Houses this report, signed by a majority of the conferees.\n\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, the Senate will proceed \nto the consideration of the conference report.\n  (The conference report is printed in the House proceedings of the \nRecord of November 15, 1995.)\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, the chairman of the conference was the \ndistinguished senior Senator from Virginia, Senator Warner. He is the \nchairman of the subcommittee of the Environment and Public Works \nCommittee that deals with these particular highway matters.\n  Mr. President, I wish to take this opportunity to thank the \ndistinguished Senator from Virginia [Mr. Warner] for his very able \nleadership of this conference. Senator Warner demonstrated patience and \npersistence and thoroughness and did a superb job. So I think we are \nall in Senator Warner's debt for the outstanding job he did.\n  I also wish to thank the distinguished Senator from Montana [Mr. \nBaucus], who is the ranking member of both the entire committee, that \nis, the Environment and Public Works Committee, and also the ranking \nmember of the subcommittee that dealt with this matter. He played a \nvital role in working out this conference agreement.\n  I also want to thank the other conferees from our committee; namely, \n\n[[Page S17204]]\n  Senators Smith and Kempthorne, Moynihan, and Reid, for their \ncontributions. Because of what they did, we were able to make the \nprogress that is represented by the conference report, which, by the \nway, emerged from the Environment Committee--the original bill--with a \n16-to-nothing vote. Mr. Rodney Slater, Administrator of the Federal \nHighway Administration, has been very helpful, as was the Secretary of \nTransportation, Mr. Federico Pena.\n  The result of the conference on the National Highway System \nlegislation is a compromise, and I know that there will be comments \ntoday about dissatisfaction with certain portions of the report, \nparticularly those dealing with the safety aspects. But nonetheless, \nlike all conferences, they are a compromise. We moved ahead in allowing \nsomething over $6 billion in highway funds to now be released to the \nStates.\n\n  The purpose of this legislation is to approve the National Highway \nSystem which is a network of approximately 160,000 miles of highway in \nour Nation. The States and localities have chosen these roads as some \nof their most important ones. The National Highway System represents \nonly 4 percent of the highways in the United States of America but on \nthose 4 percent of the highways 40 percent of the Nation's traveling is \ndone. In other words, these 4 percent of the roads handle 40 percent of \nthe total vehicle miles traveled in our country. These roads connect \nstrategic facilities including our ports, airports, train stations, and \nmilitary bases. The process to designate the NHS worked well. It is a \ncooperative process that produced a high degree of consensus among \nFederal, State, and local officials.\n  The conference agreement approves the map as submitted by the \nSecretary and recognizes that this is a changing, dynamic process. And \nso there will be other changes in the future as State and local \nofficials work with the Secretary of Transportation. The conference \nagreement preserves the important principles of flexibility that came \nfrom the basic highway act that we have which was passed in 1991, \ncalled the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act, with the \npleasing acronym of ISTEA.\n  In this legislation we passed, paperwork and regulatory burdens have \nbeen reduced, additional flexibility has been provided including \nmanagement systems; metric signing requirements; implementing the \ntransportation enhancement program; designing highways to allow for the \npreservation of environmental and scenic values; the use of Federal-aid \nfunds for preventive maintenance; and the use of Federal-aid funds for \nroads that provide connections to intermodal facilities.\n  What is an intermodel facility? It is a facility that has surface \ntransportation, air transportation, and sea transportation, all blended \ntogether and from that some goods move by truck, some move by rail, \nsome move by sea.\n  Specifically regarding what is called design standards, I believe \nthis provision provides significant new flexibility for the States and \nnew opportunities for public participation. I hope that the Secretary \nwill, in the development of design criteria, make every effort to \nensure the full participation of organizations and individuals \nrepresenting scenic, aesthetic, community, environmental, historic, \nbicycle, and pedestrian interests. I urge the Secretary of \nTransportation to make certain that State and local transportation \nofficials are aware of this new flexibility that is provided so that \nthey can take full advantage of it.\n  This legislation also provides the States with additional financing \noptions to address the needs of the transportation system recognizing \nthat the Federal, State, and local governments' resources are limited.\n  This conference report includes provisions that address problems that \nhave occurred in the implementation of the Clean Air Act.\n  One of the most effective measures to reduce air pollution is \ninspection of the vehicle that are already on the road to make sure \nthat the pollution control equipment on the vehicle is working \nproperly. This vehicle testing program is called inspection and \nmaintenance in the Clean Air Act. Many Americans are familiar with this \nprogram because they are required to take the family car to the service \nstation or repair shop once a year to get an emissions inspection. \nInspection and maintenance of existing vehicles is now required in more \nthan 60 major urban areas across the country.\n  The 1990 amendments to the Clean Air Act directed EPA to develop an \nenhanced vehicle inspection and maintenance program to be carried out \nin the cities with the worst air pollution problems. Congress mandated \nthat the existing testing programs in these areas be upgraded to get \neven greater pollution reduction.\n  EPA issued regulations to implement this part of the 1990 law in \nNovember 1992. However, those regulations went farther than Congress \nhad expected or intended. The regulations required that testing be done \nwith expensive, new technology called I/M240. Furthermore, the \nregulations imposed a penalty on testing programs that used service \nstations or automobile dealerships or other auto repair facilities to \nconduct the tests.\n  In the past, vehicle inspection and maintenance in most States has \nbeen carried out through a decentralized network of service stations \nand repair shops. But these new EPA rules virtually precluded a \ncontinuation of that approach. The testing technology is too expensive \nfor most service stations to afford. Any any program based on a so-\ncalled test-and-repair system faced an automatic 50-percent penalty in \nthe emissions reduction credits EPA would allow.\n  The States have aggressively resisted these EPA regulations for \nenhanced programs. Many States have refused to implement it. Other \nStates that initially tried to implement the program are now pulling \nback. Earlier this week the Governors of five of these States--\nCalifornia, Texas, Virginia, New York, and Pennsylvania--wrote to the \nmajority leader of the Senate and asked for legislative relief from \nthese EPA regulations.\n  Mr. President, I would ask unanimous consent that the letter from the \nGovernors be printed at the conclusion of my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Jeffords). Without objection it is so \nordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. CHAFEE. I am pleased to say that the conference report now before \nthe Senate makes the specific changes in the inspection and maintenance \nprogram that the Governors recommend. First, the bill prevents EPA from \nrequiring any State to use the expensive testing technology.\n  Second, EPA is barred from applying an automatic 50-percent discount \nto the decentralized, test-and-repair programs that some States have \nadopted.\n  And third, the bill allows States to develop innovative programs \nbased on their own estimates of the emissions reductions that will \nresult. As the Governors suggest, the conference report allows these \ninnovative approaches to be put into effect on an interim basis to \ndetermine whether they work. If they do, the States can get permanent \napproval. If not, States will be required to make adjustments to assure \nthat the emissions reductions needed to reach health standards will be \nachieved. This conference report gives the States a green light to \ndevelop programs that will work for their citizens. But it also \nrequires that the States prove that the programs are working before \npermanent approval is granted.\n  This conference report addresses all of the issues raised by the \nGovernors in their letter. We have discussed this legislation with EPA \nand based on those discussions, we are confident that these changes to \nthe program are workable and will provide a sound-basis for enhanced \ninspection and maintenance programs.\n  This legislation resolves the problems with inspection and \nmaintenance that the States have raised and should move us rapidly to \nthe day when vehicle testing is an even more effective way to reduce \nair pollution in the Nation's urban areas.\n  I am pleased that this legislation continues the ban on new \nbillboards on scenic byways. The conference agreement codifies the \nDepartment of Transportation's implementation of the law which \nprohibits new billboards on scenic byways in scenic areas.\n  Consistent with Congress' intent in passing ISTEA, the Department of \n\n[[Page S17205]]\n  Transportation has prohibited new billboard construction along scenic \nbyways on the interstate and primary systems. In some unusual \ncircumstances, a scenic byway may pass through a heavily industrial or \ncommercial area which does not possess any scenic, cultural, \nhistorical, natural, archaeological, or recreational characteristics. \nIn such cases, the Secretary may continue to permit the States to \nsegment those areas out of the designation and to allow new billboards \nin those undesignated areas.\n  Where segments are proposed for exclusion, the Secretary has the \nresponsibility to examine these exclusions to ensure that exclusions \nare, in fact, made on a reasonable basis.\n  The Secretary of Transportation continues to have the authority to \nprevent the circumvention of the requirements of section 131(s) and \nsection 1047 of the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act of \n1991.\n  The Secretary has used his authority and intervened in the past when \nStates have proposed actions that evade the Federal law banning \nbillboards on scenic byways. The Secretary continues to have this \nauthority and has the responsibility to exercise it in those cases \nwhere the States are not complying with the billboard ban on scenic \nbyways. The Secretary's authority is described in a legal memorandum \nfrom the deputy chief counsel to the Federal Highway Administrator. I \nask unanimous consent that this memorandum be printed in the Record at \nthe conclusion of my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 2.)\n  Mr. CHAFEE. I regret that this legislation repeals several Federal \nsafety requirements, including the speed limit and the motorcycle \nhelmet requirement and weakens certain truck safety requirements.\n  Why did that come about? It came about because we had votes in the \nChamber of this Senate by some substantial majorities. The body spoke \nand said they wanted these safety requirements in the hands of the \nStates rather than in the Federal Government--the speed limits on the \nhighways, the requirement that we presently have that motorcyclists \nwear helmets or that the States will lose some funds. All of that has \nbeen turned back to the States. And so now they are responsible for the \nhealth and safety of the public traveling on our transportation system. \nI certainly hope that the States will exercise extreme caution when \nusing these new authorities.\n  The conference agreement directs the Department of Transportation to \ncollect data and report to Congress regarding the costs of deaths and \ninjuries resulting from motor vehicle crashes in those States that \nraise the speed limit or change their motorcycle helmet laws. The \nDepartment of Transportation collects important safety data and it is \nmore important than ever that this data is collected and analyzed so \nthat information is available to determine the impact of the repeal of \nthe Federal speed limit and motorcycle helmet laws.\n  The Federal safety laws were repealed on the basis of State's rights. \nI am certain that State officials are concerned for the safety of the \nresidents of their States. I hope the States that have good safety laws \nwill keep them, and that those who do not will pass effective safety \nlaws recognizing the tremendous benefits of these laws in saving lives \nand reducing costs.\n  Finally, I very much regret that we were not able to include the \nSenate provision which passed by an overwhelming vote of 64 to 36 \nregarding Amtrak. The NHS bill passed by the Senate would have \npermitted Governors to use some of their highway money for Amtrak if \nthey desired to do so. It was completely voluntary and would have given \nthe Governors additional flexibility to sue their transportation funds \nwithin their own States on Amtrak service. Millions of people around \nthe country rely on the transportation service that Amtrak provides. I \nbelieve the flexibility that the Senate provision provided should have \nbeen given to the Governors and would have benefited our country's \ntransportation system.\n  Mr. President, Senator Warner will be managing this bill with me. He \nhas done such a splendid job in connection with this legislation. So I \nwould like to turn the podium over to Senator Warner at this time.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n                                                November 13, 1995.\n     Hon. Robert Dole,\n     Majority Leader, U.S. Senate Capitol, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Dole: We are writing to respectfully request \n     your assistance on a matter of great importance to our \n     States--the implementation of the Clean Air Act. We agree \n     that all Americans want and deserve clean air and that the \n     goals of the 1990 Clean Air Act Amendments are commendable. \n     Unfortunately, EPA's implementation of the Act has been \n     particularly burdensome to our States, especially in the area \n     of inspection and maintenance (I/M). Without legislative \n     changes by the Congress in this area, our States will be \n     faced with sanctions, including the withholding of highway \n     money, over the course of the next year to year and a half.\n       EPA has a bias in favor of bureaucratic test-only programs \n     in granting only 50 percent credit for test-and-repair I/M \n     programs. Rather than encouraging States to develop \n     innovative, creative and effective I/M programs, EPA is \n     forcing States into a one-size-fits-all-program by virtue of \n     its arbitrary 50 percent reduction in emissions credit for \n     test-and-repair programs. States need the flexibility to \n     design effective I/M programs that meets the unique needs of \n     their citizens while meeting the goals of improved air \n     quality. The federal government should set the goals; the \n     States should have the flexibility to meet those goals in a \n     way that makes sense for their citizens.\n       Unfortunately, it appears unlikely that the congressional \n     authorizing committees will have enough time this session to \n     complete action on legislation addressing implementation \n     problems with the Clean Air Act. Because our States face the \n     threat of sanctions by the end of next year, it is critical \n     that Congress address the I/M issue this session on any \n     appropriate legislative vehicle.\n       Specifically, our States support language which \n     satisfactorily addresses the EPA bias in granting only 50 \n     percent credit for test-and-repair I/M programs and places \n     the burden of proof on EPA to document any alleged \n     shortcomings it perceives in a test-and-repair I/M program. \n     States need the opportunity to get their proposed emissions \n     inspection programs up and running. If, once in place, the \n     real-world data proves that a program is insufficient, then \n     EPA could require that the State submit a new plan. States \n     should not, however, be prevented from implementing their \n     proposals on the basis of an arbitrary formula.\n       Thank you for your consideration of our request.\n           Sincerely,\n     George Allen,\n                                             Governor of Virginia.\n     Pete Wilson,\n                                           Governor of California.\n     George W. Bush,\n                                                Governor of Texas.\n     Tom Ridge,\n                                         Governor of Pennsylvania.\n     George F. Pataki,\n                                             Governor of New York.\n\n                               Exhibit 2\n\n                                     Department of Transportation,\n\n\n                               Federal Highway Administration,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, November 2, 1995.\n     Subject: Authority of the Department of Transportation to \n         prevent abuses of 23 U.S.C. 131.\n     From: Deputy Chief Counsel.\n     To: Rodney E. Slater, Administrator.\n       FHWA has indicated to three States that proposed \n     legislative or administrative actions are inconsistent with \n     23 U.S.C. Sec. 131(s). In each case, the State was \n     considering a statute or administrative action which would \n     have removed from their scenic byways all commercial and \n     industrial areas. The blanket exemption of commercial and \n     industrial areas required no judgment about the scenic \n     quality of excluded segments. In each case, we based our \n     action on our general authority to prevent outright \n     circumvention of the requirements of the Highway \n     Beautification Act (HBA). In our judgment, nothing in the \n     language proposed by Senator Warner, either on October 26, or \n     more recently, would impair our authority to prevent such \n     action in the future. For clarity of reference, both draft \n     proposals are attached.\n       The Department of Transportation has asserted its authority \n     to prevent deliberate circumventions of the requirements of \n     the HBA since 1971. At that time, we asserted our authority \n     to challenge strip zoning undertaken solely to allow for the \n     erection of billboards. We did so in the face of a specific \n     clause in 23 U.S.C. Sec. 131(d) asserting that States have \n     full authority under their zoning laws to zone areas for \n     commercial and industrial purposes, and that State action \n     must be accepted for such purposes. Our standards for \n     adequate zoning, which specifically prohibits zoning solely \n     to allow outdoor advertising, are contained in our \n     regulations at 23 C.F.R. Sec. 750.708, promulgated in 1975. \n     We have also asserted our general authority to prevent \n     abusive practices on any number of occasions. As early as \n     1976, the General Counsel prepared an extensive legal opinion \n     to this effect. Our authority to fashion appropriate remedies \n     to accomplish the HBA purposes has been upheld by the Courts \n     on several occasions. See, for example, South Dakota v. \n     Volpe, 353 F. Supp. 335 (D.S.D. 1973), and \n\n[[Page S17206]]\n     South Dakota v. Adams, 587 F.2d 915 (8th Cir. 1978).\n       Looking at the language proposed in the two drafts being \n     considered by Senator Warner, we note that the general \n     prohibition of new signs (except those allowed by \n     Sec. 131(c)) adjacent to scenic byways on the Interstate or \n     primary system is unchanged in either version. In each case, \n     a qualifying sentence is added which would permit states to \n     exclude from a state designated scenic byway those sections \n     it determines not to be scenic. This language, in itself, \n     contains the basis for exclusions. While it is clear in \n     adopting such an amendment Congress would \n     allocate considerable discretion to the States in making \n     determinations about whether a particular section of \n     highway is or is not scenic under State law, it is not a \n     blanket exclusion. This is similar to the provisions of \n     the provision of Sec. 131(d) mentioned above. In both \n     cases, the Department would continue to have the authority \n     to prevent actions which plainly are not related to the \n     purpose of the legislative exemption. Thus, we can now \n     prevent abusive zoning practices, and we will continue to \n     be able to prevent inappropriate exclusions of scenic \n     segments of a scenic byway. The language which provides \n     both the purpose of the exemption and the scope of State \n     discretion is the same in both versions proposed by \n     Senator Warner.\n       It must be noted that even under Sec. 131(s) in its current \n     form, the provision to prevent the erection of new signs \n     applies only to Interstate and Federal aid primary highways \n     that are on State designated scenic byways. No definition or \n     limitation as to what is a State scenic byway is contained in \n     the law. Implicit in its formulation, however, is a reliance \n     on State law definitions. In spite of this implication, we \n     have asserted our authority to prevent abusive \n     interpretations of or amendments to State law in how the \n     State scenic byway program should operate under Sec. 131(s).\n       The ability to intervene to prevent potentially abusive \n     State actions, as we did in Louisiana, Tennessee, or New \n     Mexico, is unchanged under either proposed amendment. These \n     amendments neither add to nor detract from our current \n     ability to generally prohibit abusive practices which have as \n     their purpose the circumvention of the HBA, rather than \n     legitimate exclusions of non-scenic segments of a State \n     designated scenic byway.\n                                                Edward V.A. Kussy.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia is recognized.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, before the distinguished chairman leaves \nthe floor, first, I want to thank him for his kind remarks on my \nbehalf, and, indeed, on behalf of our staff. I know that the Senator \nshares my view that this staff here, Jean Lauver and Ann Loomis, are \nabsolutely superb. Rather than thank them at the end, let us thank them \nat the beginning.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. I would like to include members of the Democratic staff \nlikewise. I know Senator Baucus will touch on that, but we appreciate \neveryone.\n  Mr. WARNER. Knowing the chairman's time is short, I think we should \naddress here in a brief colloquy the question of the billboards. I know \nthis is a subject on which the chairman has spent many, many years of \nhard work. It is the opinion of this Senator that the Senate held \nfirmly throughout these negotiations with respect to the provisions in \nISTEA, which established the landmark legislation on the billboards. \nAnd at no time did we yield in any way to the House on that.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. The Senator is quite correct. In the ISTEA legislation of \n1991, we had passed a provision dealing with scenic byways. And the \nprovision was that on scenic byways there could be no new billboards; \nthere could be the existing billboards, but no new ones.\n  The House wanted to greatly weaken those provisions. One of their \nproblems, they said, was that they required segmenting. In other words, \na scenic byway might last for 30 miles and then there would be a 3-mile \nsegment that would not be scenic and then there would be another 20 \nmiles. They thought that should be taken care of. That was a legitimate \nproblem, and we addressed that. But in no way was the billboard \nprovision gutted in this legislation.\n  Mr. President, I want to say to the distinguished Senator from \nVirginia, I greatly appreciate the way he stood firm, and, indeed, this \nwas the provision that held up this legislation right from the \nbeginning. We were on this legislation for, what?--3 weeks, the \nconference. The bulk of the matters were settled in the first week, but \nit was this billboard provision that held things up. We stood our \nground and came out with a measure that I believe everybody interested \nin scenic byways can be pleased with.\n  Indeed, I would like to just state here the report language, the last \nsentence in this particular area:\n\n       The Secretary of Transportation has the authority to \n     prevent actions that evade Federal requirements.\n\n  In other words, we have not given up the authority of the Secretary \nin any fashion here.\n  Mr. WARNER. I thank my distinguished colleague, Mr. President. I ask \nunanimous consent to have printed in the Record at this point an \neditorial from the New York Times which inaccurately states the matter \nin which this conference was concluded.\n  There being no objection, the editorial was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the New York Times, Nov. 14, 1995]\n\n                            Billboard Blight\n\n       Billboards bring blight to the highways, but the billboard \n     industry brings cash to members of Congress. That is why \n     Congress is close to undoing a modest achievement in the long \n     struggle to limit the spread of roadways signs. Billboard \n     lobbyists have held up $6 billion in highway construction \n     funds while pressing to repeal a ban on new billboards on \n     roads designated as scenic byways.\n       Their strategy may be working. The Senate whose highway \n     spending bill did not mention billboards, is yielding to \n     House conferees who insist on gutting a billboard ban enacted \n     only four years ago. At stake is a 1991 Federal program that \n     has encouraged 42 states to designate a modest 15,000 miles \n     of highway--less than 1 percent of all American roads--as \n     scenic byways. Under the program, new billboards are banned. \n     In exchange the states are permitted to advertise the roads \n     as ``scenic,'' which helps attract tourists. They also \n     received Federal funding for roadside cleanups and \n     beautification.\n       From time to time, the Federal Department of Transportation \n     has granted exemptions for new billboards in commercial or \n     industrial sections--but not nearly enough exemptions to suit \n     Representative Bud Shuster of Pennsylvania, chairman of the \n     House Transportation Committee. Re-elected in 1994 with the \n     help of $67,000 from billboard interests, Mr. Shuster \n     persuaded the House to insert in the transportation spending \n     bill a provision giving states complete discretion.\n       Senator John Warner of Virginia, negotiating for the \n     Senate's version of the bill, asked Mr. Shuster to drop the \n     billboard provision in return for the Senate's dropping a \n     measure allowing states to use some highway money for \n     passenger railroads. Mr. Shuster rejected that offer and Mr. \n     Warner gave in, saying the highway funding was too important \n     to allow further delay.\n       Mr. Warner asked only for House agreement on a largely \n     meaningless gesture, language that would show Congress's \n     approval of the way the Transportation Department has been \n     dealing with proposed exemptions. But Chairman Shuster wants \n     even this parliamentary stroking toned down.\n       The fragile scenic byways program, which depends on \n     Federal-state cooperation and sensitivity toward the \n     environment is now in danger of being picked apart, state by \n     state. The Senate needs to reject this threat to the \n     landscape.\n\n  Mr. WARNER. I think the orderly way to proceed would be to now have \nour distinguished ranking member, the Senator from Montana, who \nlikewise kept a firm hand on this conference as we proceeded to resolve \nit together with his colleagues. And I want to thank him. He looked \nafter the interests of this bill from its very inception.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana is recognized.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Virginia for \nthose kinds remarks.\n  Mr. President, I am very pleased today that finally the Senate is \nconsidering the conference report on the National Highway System \nDesignation Act of 1995. This has been long in coming and, I might say, \na bit too long because the deadline for Congress to pass this \nlegislation was October 1, some 6 weeks ago. Since that date over $6.5 \nbillion in Federal highway funds have been withheld, that is, they have \nbeen withheld from the States, very simply because of our failure, \ncongressional failure, over the past 6 weeks to get this bill passed. \nIt has been around for a couple years.\n  This has meant delayed contracts. It has meant postponing jobs. \nPassing this bill today, however, means the States will soon be \nreceiving those funds. That is good news for the States, good news for \nthe thousands of construction workers and others who will benefit from \nnew jobs.\n  The delay has been the result of some major differences between the \nHouse- and the Senate-passed bills. It was not easy to reconcile them, \nbut the leadership of the chairman of the Environment and Public Works \nCommittee, Senator Chafee, and the chairman of \n\n[[Page S17207]]\nthe conference, Senator Warner, finally bridged the distance and \nbrought the conference report to us here today.\n  The report includes a number of important provisions. I will very \nbriefly touch on some of them. But, first, let me put this bill in \ncontext. The National Highway System, or NHS, is a network of over \n160,000 miles of the Nation's most critical roads. Although they \naccount for only a small part of the total public road miles, these \nroads carry the bulk of our commerce.\n  Most importantly, the NHS is really the key to a seamless network \nthat uses all modes of transportation, linking roads to airports, \nseaports, and rail yards. It will expand economic opportunities in big \ncities and in small communities. And it will make our businesses more \ncompetitive in the global marketplace.\n  The National Highway System is especially vital, I might say, to \nrural areas, areas where highways are the only method of \ntransportation. Whether it is the transport of goods and services, \ntraveling for family vacation, or business or taking the kids to \ncollege, highways play a vital role in our lives and our jobs, most \nparticularly in rural areas.\n\n  For Western States like Montana, we have few alternatives to roads. \nWe do not have the mass transit and water transport systems that many \nother States depend on. And we will never have them. We are a large \nState with no big cities. To make matters worse, we have very limited \nair service. So designation of the National Highway System is vital. \nMontana has more miles of roads per capita than any other State, and \nover 3,800 miles of them are included in the NHS. This is about 800 \nmiles more than proposed by the Bush administration.\n  The additional routes include highway 200 between Great Falls and \nMissoula and Lewistown going west to Winnett, Jordan, Circle, Sidney, \nand Fairview; highway 12 from Helena to Garrison Junction; highway 59 \nfrom Miles City to Broadus, a very rural part of our State; highway 87 \nbetween Billings, Roundup, and Grassrange--you can imagine those are \nnot metropolises--highway 212 from the Crow Agency to Lame Deer and \nAlzada, even more rural.\n  These NHS roads link Montana farms and ranches to the Great Lakes and \nto the Pacific Ocean. These roads get our wheat to Russia and our beef \nto Japan. In short, they are our economic livelihood.\n  What is the practical effect of NHS? Most importantly, by identifying \nthese critical roads, States will be able to target their highway \ndollars to make sure the roads that get the most use are also the \nsafest and most efficient. So the NHS really does set the stage for our \ntransportation future, both in Montana and in the country.\n  Mr. President, in addition to designating the National Highway \nSystem, the conference report also reduces a number of very burdensome \nregulations and repeals several highway fund sanctions. For example, \nthe conference report repeals the national maximum speed limit. This \nmeans that the States can now decide for themselves what the \nappropriate speed limit should be on their roads without the threat of \nlosing Federal highway funds.\n  I support the repeal of the speed limit. I strongly believe that the \nState and local officials are just as deeply concerned about the safety \nof their citizens as those of us here who serve in Washington. State \nand local officials will take safety into consideration when deciding \nthe appropriate speed limits. This provision simply recognizes reality, \nMr. President; namely, that what may be the appropriate limit in \nMontana will probably not make sense in New York City.\n  Let me also point out that the conference report gives Governors a \nsay as to when the repeal goes into effect. Governors will have 10 days \nafter the enactment of the conference report in which to decide whether \nthey want the proposal to go into effect immediately or to be reviewed \nby the State legislature. If he or she chooses the latter course, the \nrepeal of the speed limit would not take effect until the legislature \ntakes action, otherwise, the repeal would become effective at the end \nof 10 days.\n  Another major accomplishment of this bill is the reduction in \nburdensome paper requirements for the States. For example, States will \nno longer have to develop six separate management systems or exhaustive \nplanning documents.\n  These management systems have become a worthless paperwork exercise, \nparticularly for rural States. Yet, failure to develop these systems \nmean a 10-percent sanction of highway funds. This conference report \nrepeals these requirements and will relieve States of this unnecessary \nburden.\n  Mr. President, it has taken the conference almost 2 months to reach \nthis agreement. As I said earlier, this has left the States without \nhighway trust funds for that amount of time. That has been unfortunate \nand I think unnecessary. However, the Senate will shortly begin the \nprocess to resume the flow of highway dollars to the States, and with \nquick action by the House and the President, States will soon see not \nonly a restoration of highway funds, but the elimination of unnecessary \nregulations.\n  So this is a good bill. It is a jobs bill. It is a reform bill. It \nwill be good for Montana and for the country. I urge all my colleagues \nto support the conference report.\n  Let me close by, again, thanking my good friends, Senator Warner and \nSenator Chafee, for their leadership. Without their skill and, I might \nsay, determination, we would not be here today.\n  Finally, let me add a few words of thanks to the Montana Department \nof Transportation and the Montana Highway Commission. The advice of \npeople like highway commissioner Tom Forseth, transportation director \nMarvin Dye, Sandy Straehl, his assistant, and John DeVierno have all \nbeen invaluable, and I thank them very much. Most importantly, Mr. \nPresident, I thank the people of Montana for their very good advice and \nhelp in crafting this legislation.\n  I also wish to thank the staff for the majority, Jean Lauver and Ann \nLoomis, for their hard work and dedication on this bill. And, of \ncourse, Kathy Ruffalo of my staff who has put in countless hours to \nbring this bill to where it is.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia is recognized.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I again commend the distinguished ranking \nmember, our former chairman of the Environment and Public Works \nCommittee. He had a firm hand on this legislation from its very \ninception. I certainly join him in acknowledging that many outside \ngroups did make valuable contributions to the formulation of this piece \nof legislation--in my State, Governor Allen and Secretary Martinez. \nIndeed, we incorporated into this bill the flexibility of States to \nlook for other means, which I will address later, of financing highway \nprojects. Now that the Federal funding could well be diminished in the \nyears to come, we have to look to alternative methods of financing.\n  Mr. President, I note the presence of the President pro tempore on \nthe floor. He asked to make a brief statement, and then I will resume \nmine. At this moment, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina is recognized.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, this bill is one of the most \ncomprehensive and important bills for our Nation. It means a lot to all \nthe States in this country. I want to commend Senator Chafee, the \nchairman of the Environment and Public Works Committee, for his good \nwork on this bill, and I want to especially commend the able Senator \nfrom Virginia, Senator Warner, for his great work. He is chairman of \nthe Subcommittee on Highways.\n  This means a lot to our entire country, and what they have done here \nis going to improve the highway system of America. I just want to \nextend my highest commendation to them.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I wish to thank the distinguished senior \nSenator from South Carolina. I also wish to note that in this bill is a \nnew corridor, a new interstate corridor known as I-73/I-74. The \ndistinguished senior Senator from South Carolina participated, together \nwith his Governor and State highway transportation authorities, in a \ncritical decision as to how this highway, as it exited North Carolina, \nthen traversed the South Carolina road system.\n  So I wish to thank him for that help in designating exactly how that \nvery \n\n[[Page S17208]]\nimportant new arterial highway will pass in his State.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I wish to express my appreciation for \nthe way this worked out. I think it is satisfactory now to North \nCarolina and South Carolina. With the help of the able Senator from \nVirginia, this was able to come to pass.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I thank our distinguished colleague.\n  I am going to start again by acknowledging the absolute superb \nprofessional assistance given by Jean Lauver, Ann Loomis, and Kathy \nRuffalo, who are present in the Chamber this morning.\n  I also wish to thank Steve Shimberg, Tom Sliter, Gary Smith, Chris \nRussell, Alex Washburn, Greg Daines, Larry Dwyer, Linda Jordan, and \nEllen Stein for their valuable contributions to this legislation from \nits inception through this conference report\n  As stated by the distinguished chairman and ranking member, with \napproval of this conference report, we release $6.5 billion in National \nHighway System and interstate maintenance funds from the Highway Trust \nFund to all States. This is not new spending, Mr. President. We are \nhere today and tomorrow addressing spending, but I want to make it very \nclear, this funding comes from gasoline taxes and other user fees the \nmotoring public--that is when you drive up in your automobile or your \ntruck or other vehicle to that particular gas pump, you pay that \nFederal gas tax. It goes into this Highway Trust Fund, and that public \npays into the fund. It is really their dollars that we are redirecting \nback to the States such that their Governors and their appropriate \nhighway officials in the State can designate how best to spend those \nfunds on their behalf.\n  Again, it is funding their citizens have provided for the direct \npurpose of maintaining a first-rate transportation system. That is my \nfirst point, Mr. President.\n  Throughout this, we preserve the integrity of the Highway Trust Fund. \nIt was a decision in this Chamber relating to the authority of \nGovernors to use part of those funds for the purpose of the Amtrak \nsystem. It was the decision of the conference, over which I was \nprivileged to chair, that we would reject that provision, again \npreserving the integrity of these funds to be used just for the \nhighways, bridges and associated needs connected with road \ntransportation.\n  Mr. President, I want to commend, again, all who participated in this \nlegislation and proceed now to state that this is a report which is a \nbipartisan effort on behalf, again, of the minority and majority and \nalso within the administration. There was very valuable participation \nby Secretary Pena and the Administrator and Deputy Administrator of the \nFederal Highway Administration.\n\n  Rodney Slater, the Administrator, came to my office on many occasions \nand, indeed, on other occasions, I had to call him late into the night, \nbut he was always there quickly to respond, together with a very well-\nqualified professional staff, to deal with the many technical issues \ninvolved.\n  I also acknowledge that my working partner in the conference was \nCongressman Shuster, the chairman of the House committee. He has a \nwealth of knowledge with respect to these issues and, as I said, \nneither of us blinked. We worked together constructively, recognizing \nthat there were differences between the two Chambers, but in the end, I \nthink we reconciled those differences in a manner that is in the best \ninterest of our Nation's transportation system.\n  I certainly join Senator Chafee in acknowledging that I was \ndisappointed, as was he, with reference to the will of the Senate and \nthe will of the majority, likewise, in the House to take certain \nmeasures relating to highway safety and transfer them from Federal \ndecisionmaking authority down to the Governors and the various highway \ntransportation authorities in the States.\n  I only urge them to look upon the safety considerations very \ncarefully, and particularly those considerations as relate to senior \ncitizens. Senior citizens are finding it increasingly difficult to cope \nwith these modern highways and high speeds, and the differential \nbetween car speed and truck speed which occur in some instances.\n  I hope, and I must say I pray, that the Governors will be ever so \ncareful as they address this new authority as it relates to their \nseveral States.\n  Mr. President, this legislation will move America's transportation \nsystem into the next century. It will ensure our competitiveness in a \nglobal marketplace by providing for the efficient movement of goods and \npeople.\n  I want to take a moment to talk about the history of highway \nlegislation in our United States. I found it of great interest, as I \nwent back and read, frankly, the biographies and other writings \nrelating to General Eisenhower.\n  This bill today is really a reaffirmation of his vision and his early \nwork. It goes way back to 1919, in the aftermath of World War I. \nEisenhower did not get to France. It was a matter of great personal \ndisappointment to him. But his then Chief of Staff of the U.S. Army was \n``Blackjack'' Pershing, the general that led the AEF in France in World \nWar I. Pershing, having been elevated to the top job in the U.S. Army, \nbegan immediately to look into the future, and he recognized that \nAmerica, at some point in time, might have to move swiftly military \nequipment from the east coast to the west coast, or indeed in reverse \ndirection. So he called on a young lieutenant colonel by the name of \nEisenhower and said, ``Take a convoy of this military equipment,'' \nheavy equipment, the very equipment that was used in France, the \nequipment that the people in our country had not seen, other than \nthrough just pictures, ``and move it from the east cost to the west \ncoast.''\n  Eisenhower embarked on this mission, and he wrote about it \nextensively--about the difficulty of maneuvering through certain areas \nand the limitation of certain bridges. The trip took over 60 days to \ntransit this equipment, and often, on some days, he only managed 5 \nmiles per day.\n  That left in Eisenhower's mind an indelible need for America, some \nday, to modernize its road system.\n  The next chapter occurred when he was Commander in Chief of Allied \nForces in Europe. When he, after D-day, first arrived on the European \nContinent to direct, hands on, his forces, he was amazed, as he would \nstudy the maps late into the night, about the rapid movements of the \nThird Reich forces to reposition themselves to confront the Allied \nForces, utilizing the Audubon system which had been laid down over a \nperiod of many years by the Third Reich. I think at that point in time \nhe said we must move America forward. Of course, as we all know, that \ncame about when he ascended to the Presidency.\n  At that time, he started the National Highway System--55,000 miles. \nThis bill now adds to that original system, which, in large measure, is \ncompleted in the bill. The new highway system was designated by the \nseveral Governors and the highway boards to make up this modern system \nwe are fortunate to have in our country today. It is perhaps the best \nto be found anywhere in the world. This system map, which this \nlegislation is approving today, consists of 160,000 miles. States, with \nthe approval of the Secretary of Transportation, have authority to \nmodify these routes, reposing in the Governors and the States the \nauthority to modify these routes for additional miles, as provided in \nthe ISTEA legislation of 1991--without further congressional approval, \nMr. President. In other words, we have taken Congress out of some of \nthe traditional roles that we have held onto in past years and given it \nto the Governors and the States, to give flexibility.\n  This total mileage of 160,600 miles consists of 44,000 miles of the \ninterstate system, 5,000 miles of high-priority corridors, 15,000 miles \nof noninterstate strategic highway network routes, and 1,900 miles of \nstrategic highway network connectors.\n  The remaining 91,000 miles were identified by our States and the \nFederal Highway Administration. The product of a 2-year dialog between \nthe Federal Highway Administration and the Governors resulted in this \nmap.\n  The National Highway System ensures a Federal commitment to a limited \nnetwork of America's most heavily traveled roads. Although representing \nonly 4 percent of the Nation's total highway miles, these roads carry \n40 \n\n[[Page S17209]]\npercent of all highway travel and 75 percent of all commercial travel.\n\n  One of the most compelling reasons for this map and the NHS is the \nlink it will provide for our rural communities. Listen carefully, Mr. \nPresident. I am fascinated with this statement: Ninety percent of all \nhouseholds in America will now be located within 5 miles of an NHS road \nsystem.\n  Mr. President, this conference report is the product of compromise on \nmany issues. ``Compromise'' is not a word that is in great favor these \ndays on Capitol Hill, but it certainly was utilized in bringing \ntogether this conference report. I am proud of the modest achievement \nthat I had in participating. I am pleased that both sides wanted this \nlegislation to reduce regulatory burdens on our State transportation \npartners. This conference report repeals the requirement to use crumb \nrubber in asphalt, to convert transportation signs to metric \nmeasurements, and to implement management systems. Again, this is a \ntransfer of power from the Federal Government to the State governments.\n  In responding to the need to increase State flexibility in using \nthese transportation funds, the conference report did, among other \nthings, the following:\n  It allows States to use NHS funds on intermodal connectors.\n  It establishes a pilot program for State infrastructure banks.\n  It adopts all of the Senate provisions on innovative financing to \nattract private resources to transportation projects.\n  It addresses the budget shortfall resulting from section 1003 of \nISTEA. States can spend unobligated balances as a means of offsetting \nreductions that will occur from this provision.\n  The conference report does not provide any funding for new \ndemonstration projects.\n  I would like to digress a moment on that, Mr. President.\n  One of the distinguished Members of this body came to me, in a very \npolite way, and was quite critical. He felt we had put a lot of pork in \nthis bill. I would like to state my view of what this bill has and has \nnot. First, when I initiated the hearings on the Senate side, I took a \nstance that we would, in the Senate, try to resist pork and any new \nprojects. This is in contrast to the 1994 House-passed NHS bill--last \nyear's bill. That bill was stopped by the Senate. But in that bill, the \nHouse had 283 new demonstration projects. I think that was the reason \nthat bill never saw signature from the President. And then, in 1991, \nISTEA, that bill provided $6.2 billion in contract authority for 539 \nprojects. I repeat, 539 projects, Mr. President.\n  That highway trust fund money is distributed to those projects before \nStates receive transportation funds, based on the formula calculation. \nISTEA also provided for $8.9 billion in general fund authorization for \n41 projects. This is not funded from the Highway Trust Fund.\n  Now, Mr. President, we changed that. We did quite a different thing \nin this bill.\n  Mr. President, I repeat, the conference report does not provide any \nnew funding for demonstration projects. We did accept the House \nprovisions that redefine some previously authorized projects to permit \nStates to use existing funds for revised priorities.\n  For example, Mr. President, in ISTEA, I will hold this chart up. I \nwill not burden the Record with it. But this is how, in a very \ncomplicated formula, we allocated all of those funds in ISTEA. But a \nState got an allocation, and the conference felt that since a State had \ngotten it under ISTEA and had made a number of plans for expenditure of \nthose funds, we should allow them the flexibility--each State--to \nretain those funds, which can no longer be applied to a specific \nproject in that State, but could be transferred to another project, \nclearly identified with their highway system. I think that is a proper \nflexibility given to the Governors. But, again, there is no new money \nin this bill.\n  On the matter of outdoor advertising on State-designated scenic \nbyways, the House provision was significantly modified. It was my view \nthat it was appropriate for the conference to simply codify the current \npolicies and procedures now being implemented and through the \nintervening years since ISTEA, through today, by the Federal Highway \nAdministration. Since ISTEA, in 1991, States have been permitted to \ndesignate noncontiguous scenic byways.\n  Those segments of a scenic byway that are not designated must be \nbased on a State's criteria. The effect of this provision will be that \nStates are allowed discretion in segmenting these routes, but the \nFederal Government's authority to protect truly scenic byways is \npreserved.\n  I think I can characterize that as follows: This was a highly \ncontentious issue between the House and the Senate. I respect the views \nof those on both sides.\n  That issue, in my judgment, most properly should be addressed next \nyear in 1996 when the Congress again exercises oversight and indeed \nperhaps other authority with respect to ISTEA. That is the time to \nreaddress the issue of the billboards.\n  Therefore, my challenge was to draw a provision in this bill which \nleft the compass, so to speak, at point zero. It does not move one \ndegree toward more billboards or one degree toward less billboards. It \nleaves both sides in status quo, preserving the right for both sides in \nthe context of hearings on ISTEA in 1996 to bring forth the witnesses \nand state their case for or against a change in the current billboard \npolicy as it relates to the scenic highways.\n  I think that was fairness. I regard it as a major achievement by the \nSenate conferees.\n  The conference report also reflects the will of both bodies on the \nspeed limit issue. While the Senate maintained the Federal speed limit \non commercial vehicles, this conference report fully repeals the \nnational maximum speed limit law. States now have the choice and the \nresponsibility to set a speed limit that responds to their specific \nhighway conditions.\n  This is an area in which I personally disagreed, but again it was the \nwill of both Chambers and therefore it was not, in a technical sense, a \nconferenceable item.\n  I remain concerned, personally, speaking for myself, deeply concerned \nabout changing the 55-miles-per-hour speed limit and strongly urge our \nStates to recognize the 20 years of safety benefits that we have \nreceived from a responsible speed limit. I want to thank a number of \noutside organizations that intervened on this issue. I join in \nexpressing my disappointment that we were not able to continue in \ncertain areas Federal supervision over the safety measures as it \nrelates to speed, helmets, safety belts, and other issues.\n  I am pleased to report that a provision is included requiring States \nto enact a zero alcohol tolerance level for persons under the age of 21 \ndriving a motor vehicle. Mr. President, that has not received much \nattention as of yet. I urge Senators to look at that provision. Day \nafter day there are news reports of young persons involved in tragic, \nsenseless traffic fatalities caused by alcohol and speed. Lowering the \nblood alcohol content for driving-while-intoxicated offenses is a small \nbut a constructive step we must take.\n  Mr. President, the goal of the NHS is to leave a legacy for the next \ngeneration. That legacy is an intermodal transportation system, a \nsystem that is not fragmented into separate parts, but rather one that \nworks in sync to serve the many diverse interests of Americans.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. WARNER. This matter is under a time limitation. The chairman has \nreturned to the floor. There is a Member seeking recognition.\n  Parliamentary inquiry; how much time remains under the chairman of \nthe committee?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The chairman's time has expired.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I yield 5 minutes of our time to the \nSenator from Washington.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington is recognized for \n5 minutes.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, while I believe this bill to be \nextraordinarily progressive from the point of view of engineering and \nthe designation of highways and the degree of flexibility allowed the \nStates in construction projects, I nevertheless am constrained to vote \nagainst the bill by reason of a number of its other provisions. \n\n[[Page S17210]]\n\n\n  First, again, while the Senator from Virginia particularly is to be \ncongratulated on at least severely limiting the damage to billboard \ncontrol contained in the bill, it is ironic that while there is a \nprovision in this bill to grant States greater flexibility to get out \nfrom under billboard controls, nothing is done in this bill to allow \nStates to enforce their own laws with respect to billboard controls if \nthey wish to do it in a different way than present Federal law \nrequires.\n  Mr. President, a great deal has been said about the delegation of \nresponsibility to the States, but the bill denies States the right to \nuse their trust funds to support Amtrak, to support rail transportation \nas an alternative if they wish to do so.\n  Neither of these provisions, however, Mr. President, would be \nsufficient to vote against the bill, but the safety provisions are. The \ncollection of provisions relating to safety in this bill are simply \ngoing to kill hundreds or thousands of Americans over the next few \nyears. The combination of the removal of any Federal control whatever \nover speed limits, the removal of any Federal requirement with respect \nto motorcyclists' helmets, the easing of restrictions on certain \ntrucks, in combination, Mr. President, are going to make our highways \nless safe to drive on. It is just as simple as that.\n  The 55-mile-per-hour speed limit is, of course, an anachronism. It is \nnot abided by 80 or 90 percent of the drivers on our highways and not \nenforced by State patrols, but that does not mean that some control \nover speeds on highways which are interstate or Federal in nature are \nnot appropriate. Far too many States will set either no speed limits at \nall or speed limits that are far too high.\n  The society is going to end up paying an increased set of health care \ncosts as a result of the absence of motorcycle helmets. We may also \nlose people and lose time as a result of some of the truck safety \nprovisions in this bill.\n  In short, Mr. President, more people will be killed, more people will \nbe injured, health care costs will be greater, all in the guise of \ndelegating responsibilities to the States where in certain other areas, \nappropriate delegation has not taken place.\n  I regret this. I believe the Senate conferees did a wonderful job, \nthe best job they possibly could have under the circumstances, but \noverall this is an unsafe bill.\n\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for 4 minutes.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I yield 4 minutes to the Senator from \nRhode Island.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. I ask the distinguished Senator from Washington --first, \nI concur in everything he said about the speed limit. As he remembers, \nI fought to preserve those speed limits on the floor here. There were \noverwhelming votes against this, as the Senator recalls--I think \nsomething like 66-32. We got nowhere.\n  I would just like to, if I might, ascertain from the Senator what he \nwas saying about weakening billboard controls. I did not quite \nunderstand that.\n  Mr. GORTON. The billboard provisions are relatively minor, but for \nsome reason or other caused a great deal of discussion on this floor a \nlittle earlier with appropriate congratulations to the Senator from \nVirginia for at least subverting some of the House provisions which \nreally would have gutted the billboard control.\n  I simply wish to point out that while most of that damage was \ncontained, if, in fact, it is appropriate to delegate responsibilities \nto the States as in some minor way this does, why was not the \nproposition to delegate to the States the right to set billboard \ncontrols without having to pay for that billboard controls approach? It \nseems to me we have a very selective view in this Congress of what \npowers ought to be delegated to States.\n  I heard, I believe, the Senator from Virginia say he hopes the \nsubject will be taken up next year. I must say I fear they will take it \nup next year and we will have further weakening rather than any \nstrengthening of those rules.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I say to the distinguished Senator from \nWashington that he is right, there is a selectivity about flexibility \nin the States, and the Senator wisely pointed that out. Flexibility is \nwanted as far as speed limits and helmets go and all that, but when it \ncomes to flexibility and spending funds for Amtrak, State funds, that \nflexibility cannot be granted. But those are what we run into, even \nthough we had, on Amtrak, a very favorable vote here on the Senate \nfloor.\n\n  But on the billboard matter, I would like to stress that the \nbillboard section solely dealt with scenic byways, not the overall \nbillboard control. And, second, we feel confident, and we spent a lot \nof time on this--I personally spent more time on this part than \nanything else in the conference--we feel that we have not given away \nanything in connection with the billboard control and that what we have \ncodified is the exact practice that the highway administration is \ncurrently following.\n  So I think we came out well on the thing, particularly in the final \nline in the conference report which I read earlier, which stated that \n``The Secretary of Transportation has the authority to prevent actions \nthat evade Federal requirements.''\n  So I am satisfied with how we came out.\n  Mr. GORTON. I thank the Senator from Rhode Island for his \nexplanation, and I wish him good luck.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. I thank my colleague.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana continues to control \nthe time.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I understand that the time on this side of \nthe aisle, so to speak, even though the distinguished ranking Member \nand I are both proponents of the bill, has expired. I ask unanimous \nconsent 15 minutes could be added to the time allocated to the Senator \nfrom Virginia.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I say to my good friend from Washington, I \nvoted vigorously against the raising of the speed limit. But I bring to \nmy colleague's attention, the Senate voted 65 to 35. That is nearly \ntwo-thirds of the Senate. Therefore, there was really no issue before \nthe conferees that we could go back and readdress such a powerful vote. \nThe vote in the House was basically just as strong.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Craig). Who yields time?\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey is recognized.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I ask, what is the situation with \nrespect to time? I believe I have an hour available.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct, he has 1 hour.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. What is the time constraint or the structure right \nnow?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 14 minutes and 33 seconds left with \nthe majority and 14 minutes and 29 seconds left with the Senator from \nMontana.\n  The Senator from Ohio has 15 minutes.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Could the Chair tell me whether the Senator from \nDelaware, Senator Biden, is scheduled for some time?\n  Mr. WARNER. He was to have time.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. It is in the order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware has 30 minutes, if \nhe chooses to make a motion to recommit.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I find myself in a kind of awkward \nposition, because I really believe we ought to make the investment in \nhighways that is called for in this bill. I will talk in some detail \nabout that. But I have some very serious concerns about the abandonment \nof safety in the interests of getting from here to there.\n  That is what I see happening with this bill. It is kind of a ``safety \nbe damned, go ahead with the Toronados,'' and whatever the names of the \nother vehicles are. So, therefore, Mr. President, I rise in opposition \nto the conference report on the National Highway System bill.\n  As one of the Senate's primary advocates for infrastructure \ninvestment, I strongly support passage of legislation to designate the \nNational Highway System. In fact, I was an original cosponsor of \nlegislation in both the 103d and 104th Congresses to accomplish this. \nThis $6.5 billion for the fiscal 1996 year that this conference report \nauthorizes, is sorely needed. If we need any proof of that, just \nconsider these few grim facts.\n  Almost one-fourth of our highways are in poor or mediocre condition. \n\n[[Page S17211]]\n   This, in our wealthy, great country, America. One-fourth of our \nhighways are in poor or mediocre condition, while another 36 percent \nare rated only fair. That is a total of 61 percent between the two that \nare fair or poor. One in five of the Nation's bridges is structurally \ndeficient, meaning that weight restrictions have been set to limit \ntruck traffic. On urban interstate highways, the percentage of peak-\nhour travel approaching gridlock conditions increased from 55 percent \nin 1983 to 70 percent in 1991. The cost to the economy for that is $39 \nbillion.\n  Experts indicate that an additional investment of $32 billion is \nneeded to bring our highway and bridge infrastructure up to standard. \nFailure to make these investments increases costs in both the short and \nthe long term. For example, failure to invest $1 today in needed \nhighway resurfacing can mean up to $4 in highway reconstruction costs 2 \nyears hence.\n  The ability of our country to sustain higher productivity is the key \nto economic growth and a higher standard of living. Higher productivity \nis in part a function of public and private investment. That is not \njust my view. Over 400 of our Nation's leading economists have urged \nGovernment to increase public investment.\n  These economists have urged us to remember that public investment in \nour people and in our infrastructure is essential to future economic \ngrowth, and clearly the National Highway System is a critical element \nof our public infrastructure. It is essential that we maintain that \ninvestment and increase our commitment in this area.\n  Unfortunately, as much as I support the provisions in this \nlegislation that would designate the NHS, I feel compelled to vote \nagainst this conference report. I do so for one simple reason, and that \nis that this bill undermines public safety.\n  The bill will cost thousands of people their lives. It will mean that \nthousands of others will suffer serious injuries. It will mean that \ncountless citizens will lose loved family members, be they their wife, \nmother, husband, father, son, daughter, brother, or sister--someone \nclose, where the pain is extensive.\n  There is no question that this bill will, unfortunately, end some \nlives and ruin others. I do not want the blood and the pain of these \ninnocent Americans on our hands.\n  I am concerned about what I see as a sense of complacency about \nhighway safety in this Congress. It is disturbing. Maybe it is \nunderstandable. Maybe we have lost a sense of urgency about safety \nbecause we have made really good progress in the past. For 20 years, \nthe motor vehicle death rate decreased steadily from a high in 1972 of \n56,000 to 41,000 in 1992, a significant decline in that 20-year period. \nIt is roughly 16,000 persons. That happened while the population of \nvehicles grew by 50 million. So we have done a good job.\n  Unfortunately, according to a recent report by the National Safety \nCouncil, the 20-year trend of improvements has now been reversed. In \n1993, traffic deaths rose to 42,200, and we learned that 43,000 died on \nour highways in 1994. This translates into a 5-percent increase over a \nmere 2-year period.\n  Where is the increase in deaths occurring?\n  A recently released DOT study showed that during fiscal year 1993, \nthe latest year of the study, fatalities on roads posted at 55 miles an \nhour fell while fatalities on roads posted at 65 miles per hour rose. \nThe study substantiates what we learned in 1974; that is, that speed \nkills. If we set reasonable speed limits, we will save lives.\n  Mr. President, I heard one of our colleagues before say that nobody \nis obeying--or few are obeying--the speed limit laws. I do not quite \nknow what that means in terms of this debate. Does it mean that people \ndo not obey the law at 55, assuming, of course, that therefore \nenforcement is weak, and they therefore will obey the law at 75 miles \nan hour?\n  That is a little hard to understand. I believe that if they go 65 \nwhen it is 55, they will go 85 when it is 75, thereby increasing the \nrisk to life and limb. That is why I am so concerned about the \nprovisions in this conference report that would eliminate entirely all \nFederal speed limits.\n  Mr. President, whether it is one of my children or one of the \nchildren of others in this Chamber, if you live in New Jersey and your \nkids or your grandchild is in a car traveling in Montana or Colorado, \nor what have you, I would like to know that family member of mine and \nof others here and of people across this country are protected to the \nfullest extent possible. That is why, when we say let the States decide \nwhen there is Federal money being put into these systems, that I think \nthe Federal Government has an obligation. We are responsible for the \nlives and well-being of our citizens.\n  One-third of all traffic accidents are caused by excessive speed. So \ncommon sense tells us that increased speed will lead to more \nfatalities. But, Mr. President, the magnitude of this increase is \ngreater than many realize.\n  According to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration--\nknown as NHTSA--total repeal of Federal speed limit requirements will \nlead to the deaths of an estimated 6,400 Americans each year. That is \n6,400 more each year. Think about that for a second: 6,400 Americans \nwill die each year because of the provisions in this bill that lift the \nFederal speed limits. These Americans will have typically family \nmembers left behind. It could be small children without a parent, or \nwives or husbands left to live their lives alone.\n  Mr. President, those 6,400 Americans do not even include the \nthousands of others who will suffer disabling injuries in highway \naccidents. It does not include the people who will never again be able \nto walk or who will never again be able to work.\n  Then, beyond these human costs, there are the financial costs. \nLifting Federal speed limit restrictions will cost taxpayers over $19 \nbillion annually in lost productivity, taxes, and increased health care \ncosts. This loss is on top of the $24 billion that we already lose as a \nresult of motor vehicle accidents caused by excessive speed.\n  To give you an idea about what that $19 billion in additional costs \nwould mean for some States, consider this. For taxpayers in California, \nthe additional cost would be $2 billion. For taxpayers in Texas, the \ncost would be $1.7 billion. These are additional costs as a result of \nthe additional deaths and injuries that will occur.\n  Mr. President, the same arguments about safety apply to the helmet \nprovisions in this bill. More than 80 percent of all motorcycle crashes \nresult in injury or death to the motorcyclists. Head injury is the \nleading cause of death in motorcycle crashes. Compared to a helmeted \nrider, an unhelmeted rider is 40 percent more likely to incur a fatal \nhead injury. That is enormous difference--40 percent. That is one \nreason why NHTSA estimates that the use of helmets saved $5.9 billion \nbetween 1984 and 1992.\n  Mr. President, repeal of mandatory helmet requirements is projected \nto lead to an additional 390 deaths every year, and it will also \nincrease the annual cost to society by about $390 million.\n  So, Mr. President, when you combine the effects of the speed limit \nremoval and the motorcycle helmet provisions in this conference report, \nthe legislation is likely to cause 6,800 deaths every year. That will \nmean more than 50,000 innocent people, men, women and children will \nlose their lives in traffic accidents in 1996.\n  Mr. President, 50,000 deaths are simply unacceptable. The Nation was \nin mourning for many years after the close of the Vietnam war when we \nlost over 50,000 of our young, brave soldiers. Many of these deaths \nwould have been preventable.\n  Mr. President, I know that many of my colleagues believe strongly in \nthe principle of States rights, and I respect their commitment to that \nview. But surely all of us believe in protecting innocent lives \nwherever possible. Who among us would intentionally withhold a cure for \na young person dying of cancer, or AIDS, or some other terminal \nillness? Who could stand by a bedside and say, ``No, we can cure your \ncondition, but we are not going to be able to give it to you. We are \ngoing to let you die.'' It would be unthinkable. Yet, in effect, Mr. \nPresident, that is exactly what we would be doing to thousands of \nAmericans if we insist on weakening our highway safety laws.\n  We will not know the faces of the innocent people who will die \nbecause of this conference report. But we know that there will be \nthousands and thousands of them. And I would suggest to \n\n[[Page S17212]]\nmy colleagues to look around at your constituents, at the people you \nknow. Many of these, maybe some of these nameless and faceless \ncasualties are even near us today. But we will not know it until it is \ntoo late.\n  The vote that you cast in favor of increasing speed can cause \nexcruciating pain and grief for families and friends that come from \none's hometown or one's State.\n  Mr. President, next time my colleagues are back home I encourage them \nto visit a trauma hospital. I have done it. It is an unfortunate, \nmemorable experience. It is a terrible sight. The result of a serious \naccident often leaves a person in the condition that perhaps death \nmight be a better outcome. Many cannot be recognized, or recognize \ntheir visitors.\n  About a year ago, Mr. President, three young men in the State of New \nJersey, ages 15 to 17, were waiting to make a turn off a road. The car \nthey were driving was struck by a car from the rear. The force of the \naccident pushed this car into the oncoming traffic, where it was struck \nby a vehicle going in the other direction. Two of these young men died \nat the scene, and the third was rushed to the hospital in critical \ncondition.\n  That weekend I went to the hospital to visit the boy and his family, \nwho are people I know. It was a terrible experience. This young man--\nhis name was Kenneth Agler--was in bed in a coma. His family did not \nknow whether he would ever wake up again and, if he did, doctors were \nnot sure what permanent damage he might have sustained. I held his \nhand, and I looked in his eyes, and he stared right through me. His \nbody was there but his soul, his mind, his vitality were absent.\n  Kenneth did eventually come out of his coma, but he has many years of \ntough, painful, and expensive physical therapy ahead of him. At the \ntime of the accident Ken and his friends were obeying the law. They \nwere doing everything they were supposed to in that situation. However, \nthey were in what could be called the right place at the wrong time, \nand it was the car that came upon them moving at a high rate of speed \nthat did the damage.\n  Mr. President, we have a cure for this pain. The question is, do we \nhave the will to use it? And we will not have if we refuse to set \nreasonable speed limit laws, and we will not if we refuse to encourage \nStates to enact motorcycle helmet laws.\n  We have had votes in this body on both of these issues, and in both \ncases, unfortunately, we lost. The vote on speed limits was 36 for \nmaintaining them, 64 against. That was, I believe, a regrettable \noutcome. I fought hard to get the legislation passed.\n  The debate for helmets was similarly decided. I do not know what the \nexact vote count was there, but the majority prevailed and helmets were \nno longer required.\n  I will say, Mr. President, at this point that this conference report \ndoes have a prosafety provision which I support, and that provision \nestablishes a zero tolerance policy for young people who drive after \ndrinking under the age of 21 particularly. This provision is a positive \nstep, and I commend our distinguished colleague, Senator Byrd, and the \nmanagers of the bill for including it.\n  I authored the bill that set the drinking age at 21 across this \ncountry back in 1984, and it is believed that we have saved over 10,000 \nyoung people from dying on the highways--10,000 families that did not \nhave to mourn, 10,000 families that were exempted from the grief of \nlosing a young family member. So this is a positive thing.\n  Unfortunately, the benefits of this provision are far outweighed by \nother provisions that undermine highway safety. As a matter of fact, in \nthis bill, we exempted a particular truck, a single-unit truck that \nweighs between 10,000 and 26,000 pounds gross weight, from routine \ninspections that are now required.\n  That is terrible news. There are about 3.25 million of these \nvehicles. There are some horrible ``factoids'' that accompany this \nexemption. Single-unit truck crash fatalities have risen nearly 50 \npercent in 4 years. Nearly 40 percent of all truck crashes involve \nsingle-unit trucks which fall within the class of vehicle eligible for \nthe exemption program. In 1994, single-unit trucks were responsible for \nnearly 1,400 deaths. Ninety percent of these deaths were to the \noccupants of small passenger vehicles and nearly half of these deaths \ninvolved trucks that fit in this weight category.\n  So we see another example of the abandonment of sensible safety rules \nincluded in this bill.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a Washington Post editorial dated \nOctober 12, 1995 be printed in the Record. It is entitled ``Trucks \nAmok,'' and it talks about the risk that is posed by the exemption of \nthese trucks from routine safety inspection.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                              Trucks Amok\n\n       Congress is doing a bang-up job of making this country's \n     highways more lethal than ever. It's all done in the name of \n     states' rights--on the grounds that 51 different sets of \n     laws, complete with higher speed limits and fewer incentives \n     for motorcycle helmet requirements--are the way to go. But \n     before the law-looseners send their big bill rolling down the \n     fast lane from Capitol Hill, there's one singularly \n     terrifying proposal that House and Senate conferees should \n     reject outright. It's a real killer, approved by the House \n     without a split-second of public debate or even a day of \n     public hearing: It could exempt a whole category of trucks--\n     about 4.75 million of them--from all federal motor carrier \n     safety regulations of drivers, vehicles and equipment.\n       This reckless provision is brought to you by your friendly \n     neighborhood fleets from Frito-Lay, U-Haul, FedEx, Pepsi-\n     Cola, Kraft Foods, Eagle Snacks and other groups with single-\n     unit trucks under 26,000 pounds. It just so happens that this \n     category of trucks is already exempted from requirements for \n     federal commercial drivers' licenses as well as from drug and \n     alcohol testing. The newest proposal makes it pretty simple: \n     This category of trucks would not be covered by federal \n     safety regulations of any kind.\n       Why worry? Just don't think about the facts--that from 1991 \n     to 1994, deaths involving single-unit trucks rose nearly 50 \n     percent; or that their involvement in fatal crashes last year \n     resulted in 1,400 deaths, only 164 of them occupants of the \n     trucks. After all, new regulations can always be added if \n     found to be necessary for public safety. Or the states can \n     worry about it and set different standards for the same \n     truck--and different odds on your chances of living when \n     you're with them on the roads.\n       Federal one-size-fits-all regulations may not make sense in \n     certain fields, but highways are killing fields as it is. \n     Conferees with consciences should see to it that the truck \n     exemption is rejected.\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, this conference report authorizes $6.5 \nbillion in infrastructure investments which we need, but while it gives \non the one hand, it takes with the other. The antisafety provisions of \nthis legislation will add almost $20 billion in additional costs on our \nsociety, so it is $6.5 billion in infrastructure investment more than \noffset in fact by three times with the extra $20 billion in additional \ncosts on our society.\n  The difference is that one is perceptible, can be seen, $6.5 billion \nin grant money from the Federal Government, as contrasted to people \ncontributing in all areas of life, whether it is business or families \nor emergency medical and health care services--$6.5 billion in and $20 \nbillion out and with that 6,800 lives annually. So if one judges only \nfrom a financial perspective, this legislation is clearly \ncounterproductive. But more important than the money, I repeat, will be \nthe lives lost and the lives ruined as a result of the drawing of this \nlegislation--6,800 lives annually at stake, tens of thousands more \ninjuries, $20 billion in lost productivity, increased health care, and \nother economic problems.\n  Opponents of the speed limit and motorcycle helmet laws argued that \ndecisions in these areas should be the responsibility of the States, \nand while I am not against giving States more flexibility in using \ntheir Federal transportation dollars, I do not, frankly, understand how \nthis decision is abandoned by the Federal Government.\n  We made that decision here again. So I support the concept of more \nflexibility in ISTEA, again, in the debate over allowing States to use \ntheir highway funding to support inner-city rail service. \nUnfortunately, I understand that that provision was taken out in \nconference as it applies to Amtrak, which I believe is a serious error \nas well.\n  Simply put, Mr. President, saving human lives ought to be our top \npriority. And while I support the provisions in the bill that would \nfacilitate investment in our highway system on the zero tolerance \nprovision, overall I see the bill as a major step backward, and I \ncannot support it. \n\n[[Page S17213]]\n\n  I would like for a moment, Mr. President, to talk about what we show \nhere on this chart about what higher speed limits mean. It shows 6,400 \ndeaths here, plus those that result from removing the helmet \nrequirements, amount to 6,800 deaths a year, $20 billion roughly in \nhigher costs. And it shows the distribution of costs as it occurs \nthrough the country.\n  In a State like California, almost $2 billion; a State like Texas, \n$1.7 billion; in the State of Virginia, $480 million. That is all lost \nas a result of the increases in speed limits. That is not a very \npositive decision, certainly not from the standpoint of the lives lost \nand the extra dollars involved. That is just one example.\n  Mr. President, the best demonstration of what happened with our \nchange in speed limits goes back some years--1974, to be precise, 20 \nyears ago. These were the State speed limits that existed prior to \n1974, and they scattered around the country. Montana had no speed limit \nat all; many were 70 miles an hour or over.\n  From what we hear on the floor, what we hear constantly is that \npeople do not obey these laws anyway, and you can add 10 miles an hour \nto that or 15 miles an hour to that. So if there is a 75-mile-an-hour \nspeed limit, woe be to that person driving on that highway at 55 miles \nan hour, because they are concerned about their safety to handle a \nvehicle when someone comes behind them going 85 miles an hour. One does \nnot have to be a physicist to know of the result of the contact between \nthose vehicles.\n  So we are kind of abandoning ship at this point without the \ntraditional lifeboats available, and saying, ``Go, go as fast as you \nwant.'' The automobile companies are--you see it subtly advertised: \n``more power,'' ``get from there to here in 30 seconds,'' ``you can get \nthere faster if you buy brand X or brand Y,'' ``for 60 seconds maybe \nyou are better off with brand A or brand B or C.'' So there is an \neffort to go faster to get someplace, and maybe pay for that luxury \nwith one's life or the life of one's loved one.\n  So that is the situation, Mr. President. I think that I am probably a \nlonely minority on this matter. I just cannot, in good conscience, vote \nfor legislation that will cause the kind of injury and pain that this \nbill will cause. I am going to vote no and strongly encourage my \ncolleagues to do the same. And, Mr. President, I repeat once more, that \nI am for the investments in our infrastructure.\n  I do not think that there have been stronger advocates than this \nSenator from New Jersey. I was chairman of the Transportation \nSubcommittee in Appropriations for some years and was always looking \nfor ways to increase investment in infrastructure, get rid of the \ncongestion on our highways, help clean the air that we breathe, invest \nin all types of transportation systems, rail and aviation and highways, \nto try and help our country be more efficient, improve the productivity \nin this very competitive world in which we live. But I could never, \nnever participate in decisions that say, ``OK, perhaps we'll get there \nfaster, perhaps we'll be able to move our missions from one city to \nanother in a little more rapid fashion. There may be some life and limb \nlost along the way, but we'll get there faster.'' That is not, in my \nview, the way to make progress.\n  I yield the floor, Mr. President.\n  Mr. WARNER addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I wish to say to our distinguished \ncolleague that I am very sympathetic to many of the points he expressed \nhere today. As I said earlier on the floor, I was not in favor of the \nspeed limit provision. Indeed, at each juncture I feel that I cast my \nvote on the side of safety. But, of course, as the manager of the \nconference I feel the bill has many vital provisions for the United \nStates transportation system. I must go forward as vigorously as I can \nand support it. And I am sure my colleague understands that.\n  But, Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator from New Jersey \nfor taking his time here to come over and really address these issues \nvery carefully, very thoroughly.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I want to say to my friend and \ncolleague from Virginia, few have the respect that he engenders in this \nbody because he is very serious about the things that he does. I really \nenjoy working with him on so many issues. Here we simply have a kind of \na divergence, if I might use the expression, of the road because, while \nI agree it is a good bill, it has many, many advantages to it in terms \nof the size of investment in our infrastructure, in terms of making \ncertain that there are conditions met in the engineering and the \nconstruction of these roads that help achieve some measure of safety, \nof improving our bridges and the infrastructure of our vehicle \ntransportation system--and I know very well that the Senator from \nVirginia has no less a concern about life and safety than do I. It is \nperhaps a change in perspective.\n  I remember so vividly that horrible accident that took place with an \nintoxicated driver, a little girl and her mother waiting for a school \nbus not too long ago in Virginia. I know we have had his cooperation on \nall measures related to driving while intoxicated, getting rid of the \ndrunk driver, getting them off the road. So we differ here, but we \ndiffer with respect to an evaluation that each of us has to make. And I \nthank the Senator for his ever-abiding cooperation on matters that we \nwork on together, serving on the same committee.\n  Mr. WARNER. I thank the distinguished Senator from New Jersey. \nIndeed, it is a matter of grave concern to this Senator as well as \nothers. The simple fact of the matter is, 65 Members of the U.S. Senate \nvoted to make a decision as to the 55-mile speed limit. Many of them--\nfor example, the Presiding Officer comes from a State which has vast, \nvast distances with a very low habitation rate on those routes, very \nlow traffic. Indeed, I think his State is one that can fairly argue in \nfavor of some flexibility for Governors as it relates to speed limits.\n  I hope the Senator from New Jersey would join me in making an appeal \nto the Governors to take into consideration all aspects very seriously \nas they begin to make the adjustments in the several States.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I say to my friend from Virginia, who knows this \ncountry so very well, I know he has traveled through and to New Jersey \non occasion, the most densely populated State in the country, my \nprecious home, and also has a major north-south highway called the New \nJersey Turnpike.\n  I am pleased to note that our Governor has made a statement that she \nintends to continue having the speed limits generally in the area that \nthey are, given the need to make a choice. But anyone on that highway \nwho sees these giant trucks bearing down on them, I do not care how \nsteely one's nerves are, the fact of the matter is that it is not \npleasant to be caught in the wind tunnel that these trucks make \nsometimes as they pass at 75, 80 miles an hour.\n  So, whether it is in Wyoming with its beautiful mountains and \nspaciousness, or the State of New Jersey, the fact is that speed is \nsomething that concerns us all, whether it is marginally higher in the \nState of Wyoming--I note here it has a higher level of speed on its \nhighways--the fact of the matter is, whether it is a far western \nsparsely populated State, they treasure lives just as much as any of us \nin the more crowded, densest parts of our country.\n  But we are in a situation now where we are making a decision about a \nbill. I am not unrealistic when I look at the vote count that took \nplace and saw that we lost the vote on this by 64 to 36. You might call \nme a sore loser in this case, but I believe in the fight that I took up \nand I hope we can do something about it. This is, after all, a \nconference bill. This was a meeting of the House and Senate conferees \nand they agreed to the policy that exists in the bill.\n  Perhaps the Senator from Virginia offers a point of some salvation \nhere in that he urges Governors to be as mindful of safety as they can \nbe as they review their speed limits on their roads.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I thank our distinguished colleague and \nmember of the Environment Committee, \n\n[[Page S17214]]\nand I take note he is the ranking member on the Transportation \nSubcommittee of Appropriations. As such, he has invested a great deal \nof his Senate career in the area of transportation and can speak with \nconsiderable authority on this matter.\n  We do, indeed, urge Governors, and I repeat again and again, the need \nfor senior citizens' concerns to be taken into consideration when these \nhighway issues are decided by the several Governors.\n  I would like to turn to another matter now. Yesterday's Washington \nPost carried a report about this bill, and in the last paragraph, there \nwas reference to the Woodrow Wilson Bridge.\n  Mr. President, I wish to provide a clarification, which I think is \nneeded for that report yesterday. And that is this conference report \nresponse to the urgent Federal--may I underline Federal--need to move \nforward on a replacement facility for the Woodrow Wilson Memorial \nBridge.\n  That bridge links Virginia and Maryland. It is the only bridge--and I \nrepeat, only bridge--in the United States of America, so far as I know, \nabsent a military facility or other Federal property, owned by the \nFederal Government. It is an absolute essential connector between the \ntwo States, and particularly as it relates to that connector \nfacilitating commercial traffic. An enormous number of trucks pass over \nthat bridge every day.\n  I cannot emphasize too strongly the importance to this entire region \nto have that bridge in first-class operating condition and safety \notherwise, because if for any reason that bridge became unusable prior \nto its projected lifespan--and I will address that momentarily--it \nwould cause gridlock, traffic jams in the Washington metropolitan area \nunlike anything we have ever seen before.\n  So that is why this Senator took it upon himself to work towards \nlaying a foundation to solve the problems associated with that bridge. \nIt certainly should not be put in any category of pork. As a matter of \nfact, I carefully put it in the bill so that what funds would be \navailable come from another source rather than any specific earmarking \nof funds in this bill.\n  The proposal that I drafted and placed in the conference report puts \nforward and accomplishes three major objectives. First, it offers an \nopportunity for the Federal Government to transfer ownership of the \nbridge to a regional authority established by Virginia, Maryland, and \nthe District of Columbia, thereby relieving the Federal Government of \nsole responsibility for this facility in future years.\n\n  Second, it provides a framework that will stimulate additional \nfinancing to facilitate the construction of the alternative identified \nin an environmental impact statement which is still in the process of \nbeing worked on.\n  Third, with less than 10 years of useful life remaining on the \nexisting bridge, this approach addresses the need to provide for the \nsafety of the traveling public and for the efficient flow of commercial \ntraffic.\n  Now, I said 10 years. I have knowledge of an engineering report that \nis now being reviewed in the Department of Transportation, and that \nengineering report may, once it passes its final review and made \npublic, it may have an impact to reduce those 10 years. That is of \ngrave concern.\n  Further, this conference gives authority to the Federal highways to \nuse existing administrative funds to continue rehabilitation of the \nexisting bridge. That was absolutely essential, Mr. President, for \nparts of the bridge which from time to time become unworkable, and to \ncomplete the environmental work preparing for decisions which will \neventually result in a new bridge or a tunnel or whatever the experts \ncome up with.\n  As I said, recent safety inspections reveal conditions of the bridge \nare much more severe than the earlier reports. We will await the public \ndisclosure of that engineering study and safety study which is working \nits way through the Department of Transportation at this time.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BOND addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I ask that such time as the distinguished \nSenator may require--I see 5 minutes--be drawn equally from that time \nunder the control of the distinguished Senator from Montana and the \nSenator from Virginia.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \nSenator from Missouri is recognized.\n  Mr. BOND. I thank the Chair, and I particularly thank my good friend \nand colleague from Virginia. On February 16 of this year, I joined with \nSenator Warner, my distinguished colleague, with Senator Baucus, \nSenator Chafee, and others in introducing S. 440, the National Highway \nSystem Designation Act of 1995.\n  From my standpoint, the NHS is a key component of the changes for \nwhich we fought so hard in the Intermodal Surface Transportation \nEfficiency Act. The NHS will demonstrate our commitment to a modern \nnational system of high quality interconnected highways, the step \nbeyond interstates, the next phase, the future for transportation in \nAmerica.\n  The good thing about NHS is that it was developed from the bottom up. \nIt was developed with input from those agencies at the State and local \nlevel who best know the traffic needs in their area. In my case, \nobviously, the State of Missouri, that was the Missouri Highway and \nTransportation Department. They coordinated with metropolitan planning \norganizations, regional planning agencies, highway groups and local \nofficials to determine the highway priorities of the State.\n  Mr. President, if you have ever followed the process of determining \nwhere a highway should go, telling one city that it will get it and two \nother cities they will not get that particular highway, you know how \nmuch work that is. But it is work best done by the State and the \nlocally responsible agencies. Frankly, it saves the Federal Government \na lot of headache and keeps them out of a job that they probably do not \nknow how to do as well as the Federal Government and cannot do as well.\n\n  I think this is a great example of cooperation between Federal, \nState, and local governments. We ought to encourage and continue this \npriority.\n  There are also some things that we have in the measure that are very \nimportant, I think, to all Americans who are concerned about good \ntransportation--the intermodal connections. And we will be presenting a \ncolloquy on the floor. It is vitally important, if we have these \nwonderful new highway systems, that they be able to plug into the \nairports, the ports, the rail facilities. Let us make sure that our \nentire transportation system works together.\n  Now, as you take a look, on a State-by-State basis, I am sure that \nevery Member who has any kind of highway transportation --and this is \nalmost all States--some have more, some have less. In Missouri, we have \ngreat need for highways, as do other States like ours. It is \nparticularly important because Missouri and Missourians need access for \nevery community of any size to a modern, safe highway designed for \nhigh-volume traffic. We need high-quality roads that connect \ncommunities within our State in a grid and connect up similar roads in \nStates adjacent to us, all the way to the markets which others now \ndominate because they already enjoy such access.\n  For my State, the National Highway System is about 4,500 miles of our \nmost economically important roads, which carry almost half of all motor \nvehicle traffic and the vast majority of heavy truck traffic. It is our \nmap to future economic development. On its signing into law, this \nmeasure will bring an estimated $156 million for Missouri in this \nfiscal year--a first step in building for the future, and a vitally \nimportant economic development project in and of itself.\n  I extend my very special and most sincere thanks to Senator Warner, \nSenator Chafee, Senator Baucus, and their staffs, who have worked with \nmy office very closely, and with me, not only providing leadership on \nthis whole measure, but providing a response to particular needs that \nwe have identified--and I mentioned intermodal connectors, inspection \nand maintenance, and designating I-35 as a high priority corridor. The \nassistance of these leaders of the Senate and their staffs was \ninvaluable.\n  Now we ought to urge the President to sign this legislation as soon \nas possible, so that my State, Missouri, and other States will no \nlonger have to \n\n[[Page S17215]]\nwonder about their highway funding. Senator Warner and I have fought \nfor a long time to make certain that everyone understands the \nimportance of highways. The legislation that he championed and which he \nhas brought to the floor today will be the backbone of the national \ntransportation network in the 21st century. It will affect every \nAmerican, directly and indirectly, by increased economic growth, job \ncreation, and reduction in congestion levels. I offer my sincerest \ncongratulations to you for not only meeting the obstacles you \nconfronted in accomplishing this legislation, but in overcoming \nsuccessfully those obstacles.\n\n  Mr. President, I reserve the remainder of my time, and I yield the \nfloor.\n  Mr. WARNER. I thank the distinguished Senator from Missouri. I think \nthose of us that serve with him on the Environment and Public Works \nCommittee, where he is a very valued member, recognize that he is the \nforemost expert on intermodal connectors--a subject that defies a lot \nof our imaginations as to how some of these things are laid out and \nwork. But they are very essential, Mr. President, to the modern highway \nsystem. He has taken the time to become an expert.\n  Mr. President, I also note the presence on the Senate floor of the \ndistinguished chairman of the House committee, Mr. Shuster from \nPennsylvania, who was my working partner throughout the conference. As \nI said earlier, neither of us blinked. We both worked in a very \nconstructive way to reach a compromise, which was essential between the \ntwo Chambers. I am confident that, in a fair and objective view of this \nconference report, it will be regarded as a step forward in the \ninterest of this country.\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. President, I wish to make a few remarks about the \nHighway Bill conference report we are considering today. The Highway \nBill is so very critical for my State of Wyoming. We need to complete \naction on this legislation very soon in order that funds can be \nreleased for badly needed projects in all the States.\n  In the west our highways have become more and more important as we \nhave observed the effects of airline deregulation and the reduction in \nrail service in our rural States. Airline deregulation has led to a \ndramatic decrease in the number of carriers and flights into Wyoming \nand we have nearly lost all Amtrak service. So the interstate and State \nHighways System was and is--and always will be our great lifeline.\n  Because highways are so very important to us the State of Wyoming has \nproposed to add three significant road segments to the National Highway \nSystem in order to link several other primary and secondary highways. \nThe Wyoming delegation has contacted the Federal Highway Administrator \nregarding this proposal and we trust he will give it every proper \nconsideration.\n  When people travel in Wyoming, for the most part they drive--and they \nusually drive for long distances. We have highways that stretch for \nmiles with no habitation at all in between. It is understandable that \nwe are so ``put off'' by a national speed limit. I am so pleased to see \nthat the conference agreement repeals the national speed limit. I think \nthat the individual States are quite able to set speed limits that \nprovide for a safe speed given local conditions. The same holds true \nfor seat belt laws and helmet laws. I believe the States are able to \ndetermine on their own if they want these laws and how they should be \nadministered without the intrusion of the Federal Government and the \nthreat of Federal sanctions.\n  I trust we will swiftly pass this legislation and get it onto the \nPresident's desk so that we can get about the business of maintaining \nour present National Highway System and constructing the additional \nmileage as we require it. Those of us from the western States of high \naltitude and low multitude understand the real necessity of passing \nthis important legislation and I would urge my colleagues to support \nit.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I support the purposes of this bill, but \noppose the unnecessary provisions not connected to its purpose.\n  This bill is intended to designate a National Highway System map, and \nit does that. So far, so good.\n  Particularly, it makes a necessary designation of a route for I-73 \nand I-74 in South Carolina. I am very glad that we were able to work \nthis out, and thank, my colleagues from Virginia, North Carolina, and \nSenator Thurmond for their cooperation on this point.\n  However, there are unwise provisions in this conference report that \nhave nothing to do with designating a map and everything to do with the \nsafety of citizens using the roads. It is neither necessary nor wise to \npass these provisions in order to do the basic designation jobs we need \nto do, and I will therefore vote against the conference report.\n  First, this conference report creates a new pilot program that \nactually encourages trucking companies and companies that use trucks to \ndeliver their goods to seek exemptions from Federal safety standards. \nThese standards guarantee that drivers get enough rest, that basic \nequipment such as brakes and lights are functional, and that trucks are \nprepared with safety equipment like fire extinguishers. Senators may \nnot realize that the page-one story on the most recent issue of \n``Transport Topics'' is the major contribution of driver fatigue to \ntransportation accidents. In this environment, rolling back truck \nsafety regulation is extremely unadvisable.\n  Second, this bill invites States to roll back national speed limits. \nI understand that State officials are conscientious with regard to \nsafety. I understand that speed limits are not always popular. However, \nwe are sticking our heads in the sand if we think lifting Federal \nprotections in this area will not kill people. Admittedly, we did not \nimplement national standards with safety foremost in mind. Congress \nimplemented a 55 mile per hour national speed limit in order to save \nfuel during the energy crisis. However, the record shows that death \nrates fell 16 percent. When we voted to raise speed limits in some \nareas to 65 miles per hour, death rates rose significantly. How much \nmore experience do we need to determine whether lives are at stake? \nAgain, we don't need a provision to roll back speed limits to designate \na map, which is the purpose of this bill. It is an extraneous \nprovision, and probably a popular one, except for those families that \nwill end up getting a call from the emergency room due to our vote \ntoday.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I speak today in support of the \nconference report for S. 440, the National Highway System (NHS) \nDesignation Act. With passage of this legislation over $95 million will \nbe made available to the State of Minnesota for much needed highway \nrenovation and construction work on the State's NHS roads.\n  Many rural and urban intermodal routes are included in Minnesota's \nnearly 4,000 miles of NHS roads. Highway 2 runs from East Grand Forks \non the North Dakota border to the port city of Duluth. Highway 53 runs \nfrom International Falls on the Canadian border to Cloquet, MN. Highway \n52 runs from Rochester to the Twin Cities. These are just some of the \nroutes that will be eligible for funding under NHS. These are important \ntrade and commerce routes throughout the State.\n  Some of my colleagues have voiced their opposition to this bill \nbecause of its motorcycle helmet language. I was pleased to support the \namendment to eliminate the penalties on States like Minnesota that do \nnot require the use of motorcycle helmets that passed during \nconsideration of S. 440 in June. The State of Minnesota has not had a \nhelmet law for the last 10 years. However, since the inception of \nMinnesota's Rider Education and Public Awareness Program, motorcycle \nfatalities have actually decreased. This motorcycle safety education \nprogram has been essential in my State.\n  I do have reservations about the language in this bill that \neliminates a national speed limit. However, this is a conference report \nand in this body we are sometimes faced with taking some provisions we \ndon't like in order to pass a bill that on the whole is a good one. The \nNHS bill is a good bill. It will free up funding that is greatly needed \nfor roads all over our country.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, the National Highway System (NHS) that \nwould be designated by the conference report before us today is an \nimportant \n\n[[Page S17216]]\npiece of our Nation's highway transportation system. I wholeheartedly \nsupport enactment of legislation to designate the National Highway \nSystem as directed by the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency \nAct (ISTAE). The $6.5 billion authorized by this legislation is a \nneeded investment in our Nation's transportation infrastructure. Just \nlook around. There is a clear and pressing need for maintaining and \nupgrading our roads. In Massachusetts, for example, two-thirds of our \nbridges need replacement or repair.\n  But as important as this investment is, it has been overshadowed in \nthis legislation by other policy changes. The final product has strayed \ntoo far from the bill I supported when it passed the Senate, and it is \ntherefore with regret that I am unable to support the conference \nreport.\n  One of the most important components of the bill that passed the \nSenate was the so-called Roth-Biden provision relating to our Nation's \npassenger rail system. Without the funding necessary to sustain Amtrak \nand without giving States the flexibility to spend their NHS funds to \nmaintain passenger rail service, it is almost certain that many \ncritical passenger rail routes--routes that offer important \nenvironmental, energy and traffic congestion benefits--will be \neliminated permanently. The conferees did not include this provision in \nthe report.\n  Another provision that was included in the conference report but was \nnot in the Senate bill relates to billboards. This matter was not \nconsidered in the Senate and reflects the worst type of special \ninterest lobbying. It has no place in this bill.\n  Yet another provision included in the conference report that was not \npart of the Senate's bill is the exemption for some three and one-\nquarter million so-called ``unit trucks'' and their drivers from all \nFederal motor carrier safety regulations. The regulations cover \nactivities ranging from driver hours-of-service restrictions and driver \nmedical qualifications to safety equipment and maintenance requirements \nand roadside driver and equipment safety inspections. An exemption from \nsafety regulations for these trucks, which are used frequently for \ndelivery services, will seriously threaten safety on our roads. This \nclass of truck is involved every year in 15,000 injury-producing \naccidents, and in 1994, was responsible for nearly 700 deaths. I fear \nwe will witness more accidents as a result of the changes proposed in \nthe conference report.\n  Of equal concern is the repeal of the nationwide maximum speed limit, \nand the elimination of the Senate provision that sought to retain the \nlimit for trucks. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration \nexpects this action will increase the number of Americans killed on our \nhighways by about 4,750 each year, and cost taxpayers $17 billion \nannually in lost productivity, taxes and added health care costs. \nMaximum speed limits also produce important environmental benefits and \nsavings in fuel consumption.\n  There are several other provisions that concern me, including the \nrepeal of the requirement that Federal highway contractors pay their \nworkers the prevailing local wage. While some reasonable reform of the \nDavis-Bacon requirement should be explored, this legislation is not the \nappropriate venue.\n  Mr. President, it is not clear whether the President will accept or \nreject this legislation. It is my hope that the President will allow us \nto revisit the designation of the National Highway System so that we \nmay proceed with a simple designation that many members support and \neliminate the controversial provisions that detract from the \nsignificance of this legislation.\n  I am aware that the conference report is the product of many long \nhours of negotiation and I want to recognize the effort put into \ndeveloping this legislation by Chairman Chafee and Senator Baucus, who \nserves as the ranking minority member on the Environment and Public \nWorks Committee. I appreciate the hard work they put into this \nlegislation and would hope we have a chance to reconsider the \nConference Report so that I might support it.\n  Mr. PELL. Mr. President, I reluctantly opposed the Conference Report \non the National Highway System Act, S. 440.\n  Back in February, I was pleased to join as an original cosponsor of \nS.440 since it would designate a National Highway System [NHS] to \nimprove the Nation's key roads, comprising some 159,000 miles. The \ntenets of this bill were exemplary. In addition to providing some $6 \nbillion in highway funding to the States, S. 440 was intended to \nimprove safety through our highway system, as well as increase mobility \nand economic productivity. As for my State of Rhode Island, this \nmeasure would bring more than $31 million in Federal highway funding to \nhelp upgrade 267 miles of key roadways, including all 70 miles of \ninterstate highways.\n  When the Senate debated S. 440 earlier this summer, I was pleased to \nstrongly support the amendment offered by my colleagues from Delaware \nwhich would have enabled States to provide a small portion of their \nfunds to assist passenger rail services. I am disturbed that that \namendment, which was overwhelmingly approved by the Senate by a 64-36 \nmargin, did not emerge from the Conference Committee.\n  I am also deeply disturbed, Mr. President, by the fact that the \nSenate provision to require a national maximum speed limit for trucks \nand buses was also dropped from the conference report. As an original \ncosponsor of S. 440, I am further disturbed that the final version \nwhich emerged from conference repeals Federal regulations on motorcycle \nhelmet laws, while also allowing States to erect new billboards on \nscenic highways.\n  Mr. President, I am aware that this was an exceptionally contentious \nconference with the House and do not in any way criticize the actions \nof my Senate colleagues. Indeed, Senators Chafee and Warner, longtime \nchampions of highway safety provisions, fought hard to negotiate a fair \ncompromise between the two divergent bills. I commend them for their \ntenacity and huge efforts to craft a good bill which would enhance our \nsafety standards.\n  I fully recognize the overall importance of this bill and the need to \nget the necessary funding back to the States. However, given the \nsubstantive changes that occurred in conference, my earlier enthusiasm \nhas waned as my concern about safety provisions increased. Mr. \nPresident, my preference would have been for a leaner, cleaner NHS \nbill, something we in this Chamber supported with vigor. I am certain \nthat we will attempt again to deal with the issues important to the \nSenate such as the Amtrak trust fund, speed limits on trucks and buses, \nand other motor vehicular safety laws.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that my statement appear in \nthe Record prior to the vote on S. 440.\n Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I want to express my strong \ndisagreement with this conference report. Although the bill does much \ngood and is certainly necessary, it unfortunately contains numerous \nearmarks.\n  While I understand that this is an authorization bill, the practical \neffect of these earmarks is to mandate spending on certain specific \nprojects. It is as wrong here as it is when similar earmarks appear in \nappropriations legislation.\n  I want to bring special attention to section 335, the innovative \nprojects section of the bill. This section appears to be rife with \nearmarks.\n  What are innovative projects? Well, Mr. President, they are nothing \nmore than demonstration projects with a new--more innovative--name. The \nname, I would venture, has been changed because passing demonstration \nprojects is no longer considered appropriate. I have introduced many \namendments in this body to end all highway demonstration projects. Most \nrecently, I offered an amendment that would ban any future \ndemonstration projects. That amendment overwhelmingly passed the \nSenate.\n  Mr. President, this section entitled ``Corrections to Innovative \nProjects'' would change existing law regarding numerous demonstration \nprojects so that money can continue to be spent on projects in a \ncertain select few States. For far too long, tax dollars sent to \nWashington by the citizens of most States are not returning to those \nStates, but instead going to fund pet projects in other States. That is \nwrong, it is not fair, and it must be stopped.\n  The problems associated with diverting highway trust fund money to \npay \n\n[[Page S17217]]\nfor congressionally earmarked highway projects are well documented and \nhave been debated before. I do not intend to belabor this point again \nnow, except to note, however, that the practice continues.\n  Mr. President, I would like to know what these so-called technical \ncorrections actually entail. The report that accompanies this bill \nstates the following:\n\n       Senate Bill: The Senate bill makes a technical correction \n     to an innovative project in ISTEA.\n       House Amendment: This provision makes a series of technical \n     amendments to innovative projects in ISTEA.\n       Conference Substitute: The conference adopts the House \n     provision with additional modifications.\n\n  Mr. President, to this Senator--someone who is not an expert in these \nprograms, but who is expected to vote on this matter--this \nclarification is not sufficient.\n  Mr. President, again I want to repeat, this is an important bill and \nI am sure passing it is vital. But what is more vital is balancing the \nbudget and paying down the debt, and continuing the practice of \nearmarking demonstration projects is exactly the wrong thing to do at \nthis time.\n  In Reinventing Government, Vice President Gore  stated:\n\n       GAO also discovered that 10 projects--worth $31 million in \n     demonstration funds--were for local roads not even entitled \n     to receive federal highway funding. In other words, many \n     highway demonstration projects are little more than federal \n     pork.\n\n  The Reinventing Government report went on to say:\n\n       Looking specifically at the $1.3 billion authorized to fund \n     152 projects under the 1987 Surface Transportation and \n     Uniform Relocation and Assistance Act, GAO found that ``most \n     of the projects . . . did not respond to States' and regions' \n     most critical federal aid needs.\n\n  Unfortunately this bill demonstrates that the Congress continues to \nfind innovative ways to promote its most favored projects.\n  If a project has merit, it should be a priority under the individual \nState's transportation plan. Highway funding should be distributed \nfairly according to establish formulas so that taxpayer's dollars can \nbe spent according to the priorities established with such great care \nand expertise by those best qualified to do so--the individual States.\n  Mr. President, I hope that we will end the practice of earmarking \nmoney for demonstration projects or innovative projects or any other \nsimilarly earmarked projects. The time has come to change our ways.\n  I thank my colleagues for their indulgence.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I rise in support of the conference \nreport accompanying the National Highway System bill but I do so with \nreservations. While I support the need to move forward with badly \nneeded construction funds for our Nation's highways including the \nWoodrow Wilson Bridge, I am greatly disturbed by the weakening of \nhighway safety laws.\n  Our Nation's highways are absolutely vital to our infrastructure. \nThis legislation will release approximately $100 million in badly \nneeded highway funds for my own State of Maryland. These funds have \nalready been factored into Maryland's highway program and need to be \nreleased in order to avoid slowdowns in construction. These funds will \ncreate construction jobs and help States meet the increasing costs of \nmaintaining our highways.\n  This legislation also authorizes the creation of a new interstate \nauthority for the Woodrow Wilson Bridge and authorizes funding for \nongoing maintenance of the bridge. As a major artery serving Maryland \nand the entire National Capital region, the maintenance and eventual \nreplacement of the Wilson Bridge must proceed without delay.\n  However, I fail to see the justification for weakening highway safety \nlaws, including motorcycle helmet laws. I believe that the Government's \nprimary responsibility is to protect public health and safety. \nDelegating this responsibility to the States is not consistent with the \nFederal Government's role in regulating interstate highways or \nprotecting public safety. How else can we guarantee that Marylanders \nwill be safe driving in other States? The Federal Government should \nmaintain its role in public safety matters, not delegate it to the \nStates.\n  While I am disappointed with the decision to weaken safety laws, I \nbelieve that we must move forward with the construction funds that \nMaryland and other States need to maintain and improve our highways. A \nreliable and well maintained infrastructure is a vital element in our \nability to sustain economic growth and job creation into the next \ncentury. So, I will vote in favor of this legislation despite my \nopposition to weakening highway safety laws.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today in opposition to the \nconference report on the National Highway Systems bill. As my \ncolleagues know, I am a strong supporter of infrastructure development, \nand am an especially strong supporter of the transportation \ninfrastructure provided for in this bill which is so vital to my State. \nI appreciate the hard work of the Senators from Virginia, Rhode Island, \nand Montana, and I want to thank them and their staffs for their work \nin the difficult crafting of this legislation.\n  This conference report will provide California with $569 million in \nmuch needed and long overdue Federal highway funding for essential \ntransportation projects. Unfortunately, however, the public safety \nmeasures included in the legislation compel me to oppose this \nconference report.\n  My specific concerns are with the repeal of the 55 miles per hour \nspeed limit for automobiles, the lack of a national speed limit for \ntrucks, and the repeal of Federal motorcycle helmet laws.\n\n\n                     repeal of national speed limit\n\n  According to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, one \nthird of all fatal crashes are speed related, and 1,000 people are \nkilled every month in speed-related crashes.\n  The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration predicts \nelimination of the national speed limit on nonrural interstates and \nnoninterstate roads will increase deaths by 4,750 annually at a cost of \n$15-$19 billion in additional insurance costs. This amounts to an \nincrease of $2 billion per year in California.\n  Almost 25 percent of all accidents in California are speed related. \nIn California, the Highway Patrol reports that in 1994 there were 436 \nfatal accidents and 48,877 injuries that were speed related.\n\n\n                         speed limit for trucks\n\n  During initial consideration of this bill, Senator Reid offered an \namendment to retain a national speed limit on trucks. I supported this \namendment because, according to the California Highway Patrol, the \nState of California has seen a steady reduction in the number \naccidents, injuries and fatalities relating to accidents involving \ntrucks since 1989.\n  In 1989, 647 people lost their lives and 17,703 people were injured \nin California as a result of 12,159 truck-related accidents.\n  By 1994, 451 people were killed and 13,512 injured in California as a \nresult of 9,225 truck-related accidents.\n  I look forward to working with the administration and my colleagues \nin the Senate to address the growing problems associated with making \nthese big rigs safe.\n\n\n                        motorcycle helmet repeal\n\n  Since enactment of California's motorcycle helmet law in 1992, the \nCalifornia Highway Patrol estimates that motorcycle fatalities have \ndecreased by 41 percent and motorcycle injuries have decreased by 35 \npercent. I believe helmets save lives, and our Nation's highways will \nbe a little less safe for all of us without their use.\n  In closing, let me say that I cannot support legislation that will \nvery likely put greater numbers of traveling public at risk. Were this \nonly an infrastructure bill, it would very likely have my support. Only \ntime can tell if my concerns will be realized. If they are, I hope this \nbody will take immediate action to remediate some of the changes this \nbill makes.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I rise today to support the National \nHighway System Designation Act. I add my support to this conference \nreport though, with serious concerns. Concerns over the safety \nprovisions I originally voted for in the Senate legislation have now \nbeen replaced by changes to the bill that could threaten the safety of \nour Nation's highways.\n  Of foremost concern is the Senate provision to require a national \nmaximum speed limit for trucks and buses. \n\n[[Page S17218]]\nThis important mandate was dropped from the conference report and will \nnot only increase speeds for the oversized vehicles, but also increase \ntheir stopping distances.\n  I am also concerned over a House provision that could exempt trucks \nweighing 10,000 to 26,000 pounds gross vehicle weight rating from \nFederal safety rules including driver hours-of-service restrictions, \ndriver medical qualifications, safety equipment and maintenance \nrequirements, and roadside driver and equipment safety inspections.\n  Mr. President, I am hopeful that our State legislatures will step up \nand seek solutions to these shortcomings in an otherwise well \nintentioned piece of legislation. I was hesitant to support a \nconference report that retreats on issues of safety such as these, \nhowever the passage of this national highway system designation is \nessential to our Nation's very livelihood. A delay of implementation of \nthis act will begin to cost my State of Washington approximately $120 \nmillion over 2 years.\n  The time to move this bill is long overdue. We can not lose this \nvaluable opportunity to support 4 percent for the Nation's four million \nmiles of public roads. This National Highway System will carry 40 \npercent of the Nation's highway traffic and 70 percent of the truck \nfreight traffic. One behalf of my State's Governor and secretary of \ntransportation, I urge my colleagues to pass this conference report and \ncontinue our Nation's strong commitment to interstate commerce and \nmobility.\n\n\n                         Flexibility for Amtrak\n\n  Mr. HATFIELD. Mr. President, it is unfortunate that the National \nHighway System conference report does not include the Senate-passed \nAmtrak passenger rail provision, which provided States the flexibility \nto use their Federal transportation dollars for passenger rail service. \nThis proposal would have given States the ability to decide what \ntransportation system best meets their needs and allocate their \ntransportation funds accordingly. In a time of severe budget \nconstraints at all levels of government, this provision would have \nempowered State and local officials to make the best use of the Federal \nresources provided to them.\n  Sixty-four Senators supported the Amtrak passenger rail amendment \nwhen S. 440, the National Highway System designation bill, was debated \non the Senate floor. Sixty-four Senators--from both sides of the aisle, \nrepresenting both very rural States and congested urban States; \nchairmen of the committees who oversee aviation, highways, and mass \ntransit--supported the provision, recognizing that States need more \nflexibility in the use of their transportation funds.\n  The State of Oregon is currently involved in a situation requiring \nample flexibility to retain an important element of Oregon's \ntransportation infrastructure system. Governor Kitzhaber, Secretary \nPena, Amtrak president Downs and I are working together to develop a \nplan to keep the Cascadia train, which runs between Portland and \nEugene, operating. The Cascadia has been an extremely successful \npassenger rail provider for Oregon and, unfortunately, it is scheduled \nto be terminated on December 31, 1995. Innovative proposals, such as \nthe Amtrak passenger rail provision, would be extremely helpful in \nallowing Oregon and other States to meet their respective \ntransportation needs.\n  According to the most recently compiled U.S. Department of \nTransportation statistics, more than $15,800,000 in CMAQ funds were \nsubject to lapse at the end of fiscal year 1995. It makes absolute \nsense to make these lapsed funds available to States for the operation \nof intercity passenger rail. Many other Federal programs that provide \nState allocations pool all unobligated funds at some point during the \nfiscal year and redistribute them to States who have projects cleared \nand awaiting funding. This would provide a solution to transportation \nchallenges in many States and it is consistent with the Intermodal \nSurface Transportation Efficiency Act (ISTEA) funding priorities.\n  The CMAQ program, created in ISTEA, provides an incentive to focus on \ntransportation alternatives that reduce traffic congestion, improve air \nquality, and lower fuel consumption. These funds can be used on \ntransportation programs, projects, strategies, or methods which will \ncontribute to the attainment of a national ambient air quality \nstandard, whether through the reduction of vehicle miles traveled, the \nreduction of fuel consumption, or other means. Amtrak passenger rail \nservice clearly meets this definition, and should be deemed an eligible \nuse of CMAQ funds.\n  Mr. President, although I am disappointed that the NHS designation \nconference report came back without the Amtrak passenger rail \nprovision, I do not support a potential motion to recommit this \nconference report. However, I do want to express my sincere regret that \nthe conference agreement does not include this important provision that \nwould provide my State, and many others, with the needed flexibility to \nuse their Federal transportation dollars in the most effective way \npossible.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I support final passage of S. 440, the \nNational Highway Designation Act. This legislation includes provisions \nthat I had requested to help my State in the area of traffic congestion \nrelief, air quality, and international trade.\n  I wish to thank my chairman, Senator Chafee, our subcommittee \nchairman, Senator Warner, and our ranking minority member, Senator \nBaucus, for preserving the California provisions that I requested in \nthe Senate bill.\n  The most significant provision is the assistance provided for the \nAlameda transportation corridor, a project to consolidate three rail \nlines into a single 20-mile high-capacity highway and rail corridor \nserving the ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach. The project is \nexpected to generate 10,500 direct construction jobs. Today, more than \n25 percent of all U.S. waterborne, international trade depends on the \nports of Los Angeles and Long Beach to reach its market.\n  The National Highway System Act will provide the Alameda \ntransportation corridor the financing tools it needs to become southern \nCalifornia's linchpin to increased Pacific rim trade.\n  Once the House passes this NHS bill, as expected, for the first time \nCongress will have recognized the corridor not as a series of \nindividual intersection improvements, but as a single, high priority \ninfrastructure project. The Alameda project will speed cargo along a \ncorridor of uninterrupted rail and highway traffic between our national \ntransportation network to the ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach.\n  Federal highway funds can now be spent on a single program to \neliminate 200 street and rail intersections.\n   The NHS bill also designates the corridor as a high priority \ncorridor under the Intermodal Surface Transportation and Efficiency Act \n[ISTEA]. That will make the project eligible for guaranteed Federal \nloans or other innovative financing options available to the Secretary \nof Transportation.\n  Secretary Pena wrote to me last month, acknowledging that the Alameda \ncorridor ``is an extremely important project that will benefit the \nentire Nation'' and committing to work with us ``to make the Alameda \ntransportation corridor a reality.''\n  Now that we have made the project eligible for the Secretary's \nrevolving loan program, we are working closely with the administration \nto obtain seed money in the President's fiscal year 1997 budget in \norder to initiate this innovative financing program.\n  This bill also ensures that California will continue to receive its \nshare of transportation funds used to enhance air quality under the \nCongestion Mitigation and Air Quality Program, despite the improvements \nto air quality in the San Francisco Bay area.\n  The San Francisco Bay area was recently upgraded from a non-\nattainment area to a maintenance area for its air quality. Although the \nimprovement is welcome news, under current law the area and the State \nwould lose its CMAQ funding. The program provides funding to the States \nfor local traffic improvements to relieve congestion and reduce air \npollution in urban areas with poor air quality.\n  I believe we should not penalize communities that improve air quality \nby eliminating much-needed funding. The air quality funds provide $15 \nmillion each for BART rail car rehabilitation and Santa Clara County's \nlight rail construction in the Tasman corridor, among other projects to \nreduce traffic emissions. \n\n[[Page S17219]]\n\n  Another part of the bill that I requested would assist the seismic \nretrofit project for the Golden Gate Bridge. This language allows the \nGolden Gate Bridge, Highway and Transportation District to begin \nspending local funds now for the $175 million project to protect the \nfamous bridge from earthquakes. When Federal funding is available in \nthe future, the Federal Highway Administration will apply those funds \nspent now toward the 20 percent local match required for Federal \nfunding.\n  The NHS bill also includes two provisions that would redirect \npreviously authorized spending for high-cost projects in Los Angeles \nand Long Beach to more practical projects that can be completed sooner.\n  The first measure would help alleviate the gridlock that has occurred \nalong Sepulveda Boulevard near the Los Angeles International Airport. \nIn 1991, Congress authorized $8.95 million to develop alternative \napproaches to expanding the Sepulveda Boulevard Tunnel that runs \nunderneath the airport. However, an analysis completed last year \nindicated expansion of the tunnel would require considerable more \nfunding. Less costly, short-term measures were sought to reduce the \ncommuter and airport traffic using the tunnel.\n  The final conference agreement includes my provision to redesignate \nthe funds for the following projects: $3.5 million for the airport's \ncentral terminal ramp access project, $3.5 million for Aviation \nBoulevard widening south of Imperial Highway, $1 million for Aviation \nBoulevard widening north of Imperial Highway and $950,000 for \ntransportation systems management improvements near the tunnel.\n  A second provision would use $7.4 million previously authorized to \nconstruct carpool lanes on Interstate 710 in Long Beach for downtown \nLong Beach access ramps to separate city traffic from the heavy trucks \ncarrying port cargo. This project will enhance safety at the terminus \nof I-710.\n  There are provisions in this final bill that I do object to. I am \nvery concerned and disappointed that this bill rolls back gains we have \nmade in this Nation to curb the carnage on our highways. The bill ends \nthe maximum national speed limit for all vehicles. After the national \nmaximum speed limit was established in 1974, we saved 9,000 lives.\n  The final bill also would effectively exempt small to mid-sized \ntrucks from safety regulations, a House provision on which the Senate \nnever held a hearing.\n  Finally, the bill was stripped of the Senate amendment to grant to \nStates the option of using its flexible category of highway funds for \nAmtrak operations. I am surprised at the House opposition to this \namendment to grant States more flexibility in funding transportation \nprograms. These funds already can be used for mass transit and bike \npaths. Including Amtrak only makes sense and at a time when Amtrak \nservice cutbacks are leaving commuters and intercity passengers \nstranded on station platforms. This modest assistance could be nothing \nbut helpful.\n  I have a long record in support of strong transportation safety \nmeasures, from highways to runways. However, realistically, a vote \nopposing final passage of the NHS would not change the outcome. I know \nSenator Chafee shared my concern about the safety provisions and the \nloss of the Amtrak amendment. About two-thirds of the Senate had voted \nto eliminate the national speed limit, and if Senator Chafee could not \nwin on the Amtrak amendment in conference, then it could not be saved.\n  Nevertheless, despite these flaws, passage of the National Highway \nSystem Designation Act is crucial. About $6.5 billion in highway have \nbeen withheld from the States since October 1. California will receive \n$569 million once this act is passed. This money is urgently needed to \nhelp relieve our backlog in road maintenance projects.\n  We will be reauthorizing the highway bill in 2 years. At that time, I \nhope we can reconsider these issues important to preserving the safety \nof our traveling public.\n  Mr. NICKLES addressed the Chair.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I yield such time to the distinguished \nSenator from Oklahoma as he may require, drawing it jointly from that \nunder the control of the Senator from Montana and myself.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma is recognized.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I wish to thank my colleague from \nVirginia, as well as my colleague and friend from Montana, for their \nleadership in bringing this bill to the floor.\n  Mr. WARNER. If the Senator will yield for a moment, I wish to advise \nthe Senator from Delaware and the Senator from Ohio that, in all \nlikelihood, following the remarks by the one or two Senators now \njoining us on the floor, we will turn to those allocations of time \nunder the time agreement. In their absence, a quorum call would have to \nbe charged against those time periods.\n  I yield back to the Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Again, I thank my friends and colleagues from Virginia \nand Montana for bringing this important bill to the floor. I hope our \ncolleagues will strongly support it and that the President will sign \nit. It will mean jobs in our States. It will help rebuild our national \nroad infrastructure. I compliment them.\n  The reason I come to the floor today is to speak specifically on the \nissue on speed limits, because I have heard some of our colleagues \nimply that this bill increases speed limits. It does not do that. What \nthis bill does do is insert a provision that myself, Senator Burns, and \nothers, support. It would eliminate the Federal penalty mandating a \nnational limit. It does not say we eliminate speed limits.\n  I happen to favor speed limits. But I favor States setting them \ninstead of the Federal Government. Some people assume that we are \nautomatically going to have higher speed limits all across the country. \nI do not know that that will be the case. Undoubtedly, in many cases, \nyou will have increased speed limits, if the State legislatures, \nworking with their Governors, make that decision.\n  So it is really not a question of whether or not we are going to have \nspeed limits or what the speed limits will be. It is a question of who \ndefines what the speed limits will be. What many of us are saying, and \nwhat this legislation says, is we are going to repeal the Federal \npenalty. This Federal penalty says if you do not comply with the \nnational speed limit, we are going to withhold some of a State's \nfunds--funds which rightly belong to the State.\n  I am amazed sometimes that some people think the Federal Government \nknows best, so the Federal Government is going to set speed limits. I \ndisagree. The Federal Government is going to set other criteria. What \nwe are saying in this legislation is that the proper body or electorate \nto make this decision is at the State level. We have heard a few people \ntalk about the 10th amendment, but the 10th amendment states: ``The \npowers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor \nprohibited by it to the States, are reserved to the States \nrespectively, or to the people.''\n  That is exactly what we are doing in this legislation--reserving to \nthe States the power to set the speed limits in their States. The \nappropriate speed limits in Oklahoma or Montana may be quite different \nthan the speed limits in Delaware or Rhode Island. So it makes sense if \nthe elected representatives of those individual States would set those \nspeed limits. They know the road conditions better than we do on the \nFederal level. And 55 may be too fast. That is the national speed \nlimit. It may be too fast, or it may be too high in some areas. The \nState should have the authority to set it. Maybe 55 is not high enough \nin some other areas. Let the States decide.\n  Some of my colleagues assert that it is going to result in a large \nincrease in fatalities. That, I think, misses the question. I think the \nStates, and the elected officials in the States, are just as concerned \nabout the safety and health of their constituents--maybe more than we \nare on the Federal level. They are concerned. They know those stretches \nof roads that have a higher number of fatalities, and they are the ones \nresponsible for fixing them. It may be that, on a rural interstate, 55, \n65, or 70 miles an hour may be safe. But it may have some winding areas \nthat maybe should be set at 40 miles an \n\n[[Page S17220]]\nhour. The State should know that, and they should make that \ndetermination.\n  We should not have a Federal law that says nowhere in the country can \nit exceed 55. We passed a law in 1987--and I was a sponsor--that on \nrural interstates limits could go to 65 miles an hour. Even when we \npassed that, my argument was, really, it should not be set by the \nFederal Government. It should be set by the State governments. This is \nan area where, really, State and local governments should have \npriority.\n  Again, I want to take issue with the fact that some people say there \nare going to be thousands of more deaths or fatalities if this bill \npasses as it is. I take issue with that. One, I believe they are \nlooking at a study that assumes that all roads that are now 55 will be \ngoing to 65 or 70. I do not think that is the case. You have a lot of \nStates that probably had higher speed limits that now are at lower \nspeed limits. They may leave them there. That is fine. I could really \ncare less. I think it should be their responsibility, the State's \nresponsibility. And to assume that all of the highways in the country \nthat are now at 55 will be increasing to 65 or 70 would be a mistaken \nassumption. But the States should be the ones that would have that \nresponsibility. I just happen to believe that Governors and legislators \nin those States are just as concerned, maybe even more than we are for \ntheir constituents' safety.\n  I think they will keep safety in mind when they make those decisions. \nThey are the duly elected body of the people from that State and \nhopefully will be responsive to their wishes and to their safety needs.\n  I am delighted that this legislation finally takes away this Federal \nmandate, this Federal law that says if you do not comply with \n``Government-knows-best, Washington, DC,'' we will withhold some of \nyour money.\n  I am delighted we finally have repeal of the Federal mandate. We did \nnot repeal speed limits, we had the repeal of the national Federal \nspeed limit, and now we will be returning speed limit decisions to the \nrightful level of Government, and that is to State and local \nauthorities.\n  Again, I compliment my friends and colleague, and I wish to \ncompliment the Senator from Rhode Island for his leadership in passing \nthis bill as well. I am delighted it is on the floor. I hope the \nPresident will sign it.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I thank the participation of the able \nSenator from Oklahoma. We may have some differences of view on this \nparticular subject, but we hope that the accident rates do not dictate \nthe Federal Congress will once again have to intervene and readdress \nthis issue.\n  The Senator from Wyoming, a distinguished member of our committee, \nseeks recognition, and at such time as he gains the floor Senator \nBaucus and myself yield such time as the Senator from Wyoming may \nrequire.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia and the Senator from \nMontana jointly have 9 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. WARNER. I thank you for that advisory.\n  For those Senators during the course of the vote that might wish to \nacquaint themselves with the national highway map, we have arranged for \nit to be placed in the Vice President's office jut off the Chamber. I \nurge Senators to take a look.\n  I yield such time to the distinguished Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I listened carefully to what the \ndistinguished Senator from Oklahoma had to say. He has been a long \nbattler for the States being able to set these speed limits. He \nprevailed overwhelmingly on the floor of this Chamber.\n  I did not agree with him, but the vote was clearly in his favor. I \njust hope he is right. I hope he proves the rest of us to be absolutely \nwrong. I hope that the speed limits will be monitored carefully by the \nStates.\n  I think there is a lot in what he says in that the States are \nconcerned about highway deaths. I know when I was Governor, every year \nI paid a great deal of attention to the deaths on our highways and \nsought to bring it down. Whether all the Governors spend time on \nmatters like that, as I did, I do not know. I just hope he is right. I \nhope a year from now we can say to the Senator from Oklahoma, ``You \nwere right and we were wrong.'' If so, I would be very, very pleased. \nHere is a case where I would be glad to be proven wrong.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I join the distinguished chairman in his \nobservation.\n  I think, in fairness, we should put in context here that the Federal \nhighway limits were put on as a consequence of a very severe energy \ncrisis that faced the United States. It was viewed then as an energy \nconservation measure.\n  Once they were placed as a matter of law, we did see, fortunately, a \nvery rapid reduction in accident rates across America. So that was an \nunanticipated fallout of this.\n  I see the distinguished Senator from Wyoming and yield such time as \nhe may require, bearing in mind that the managers have about 7 minutes \nleft.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator from Virginia is up \nand the Senator from Montana has 7 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I wonder if I might just take a couple minutes off my \ntime while the time allocation for the Senator from Wyoming is being \nconsidered.\n  Would the Senator from Wyoming indulge us?\n  Mr. THOMAS. I am happy to. I am not sure we have any time.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, we will find the time for the Senator from \nWyoming if he would be gracious enough to indulge the Senator.\n  Could I inquire how much time the Senator from New Jersey has \nremaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There are 22 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. WARNER. Would the Senator from New Jersey be willing to take from \nhis time and allocate 5 minutes to the Senator from Wyoming?\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I would not object to the unanimous consent to allow \nan extra 5 minutes.\n  Mr. WARNER. I will place that in the form of a unanimous-consent \nrequest.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I just wanted to respond to some of \nthe comments that have recently in the last little while been made. I \ndo not want to be harsh. I think we know around here despite the fact \nthat occasionally this does look like fantasy land, wishing never makes \nit so. Law makes it so, votes make it so.\n  That is what happens. Reality takes over. Thus, when we talk about no \nassurances that the States will rush to bump up their speed limits the \nminute they have this permission, I point out something to those who \nwould believe it, that there are several States--nine in particular--\nthat have already in law a requirement that once the Federal speed \nlimits are removed, and I address this to my distinguished colleague, \nthe chairman of the Environment and Public Works Committee, Senator \nChafee, once the law is removed, the Federal speed limit is removed, \nthere are nine States that immediately bump up by virtue of existing \nstatutes.\n  I am pleased to name them. It does not matter. Just for edification, \nI will: Montana, Kansas, Nevada, Wyoming, Oklahoma, South Dakota, \nMissouri, Texas, and California. These are States that already \ncommitted that once the rules are off from the Federal Government, they \nimmediately move up. There are 28 other States that are States that \nhave bypassed actions, indicate that they are anxious to get the speed \nlimits moved up. They are States which increase the maximum speed limit \non rural interstates within 6 months of the 1987 congressional \nenactment allowing 65 miles an hour.\n  It is fairly easy to recognize, Mr. President, because the States \nthat are outlined in blue, it is a fair number, and when combined with \nthe nine States, gives us a total of 37 States that are likely to move \nahead with their speed limit increases.\n  I just put that in the Record, Mr. President, to indicate that as \nmuch as we hope, as much as we wish, we would like to see constraints \non speed limits, it ``ain't'' going to happen, to put it crudely. So \nthe mayhem that will follow that I projected--and I do not want to be \nthe forecaster of gloom and doom around here, but I want to be \nrealistic about what is going to happen when this bill becomes law.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I am particularly pleased that the Senate \n\n[[Page S17221]]\n  today is considering the conference report on Senate 440, a bill that \nwill designate the highway system. The States have been waiting for a \ngood long time now, waiting since October 1, for this bill to pass, so \nthat the $6.5 million in highway funds--which, of course, belongs to \nthe States--can be distributed and used for the purpose for which the \ndrivers and purchasers have paid.\n  I particularly want to recognize Senators Warner, Chafee, Baucus, and \nothers who have worked very hard to bring this bill to the floor. I \nappreciate their leadership and appreciate the opportunity to have \nserved on that committee.\n  I support this bill for a number of reasons. Not only is the bill \nimportant, of course, to all of us in our highway systems, but \nparticularly important from the economic and job creation perspective. \nIt also, it seems to me, sets a direction for the transportation needs \nof our country and does so well into the next century.\n  In addition, I am pleased with some of the philosophical changes that \nare found in this bill. This proposal increases State flexibility in a \nnumber of areas.\n  Let me just say, philosophically I agreed with that and I find it \ndifficult to hear people constantly talk about the fact that we really \nought to run it from here because we do not trust those rascals in the \nState. I do not understand that. I have a hard time with that.\n  This bill permits a State to increase the transfer of funds from \nbridge accounts to the National Highway System and Surface \nTransportation Program categories, eliminates the Federal mandates that \nthe States adopt Federal management systems, repeals some of the \nFederal mandates requiring the use of crumbed rubber asphalt--I happen \nto favor the idea--and to transfer to the State the question of \nmandatory helmet laws and certainly the maximum speed limit.\n  I come from a large rural State, quite different from New Jersey, \nquite different from Rhode Island, in terms of our obligations to \nprovide for transportation. I also served in the Wyoming legislature, \nand I have great confidence in that body's ability to determine and \nhave as much interest in the safety of Wyoming drivers and others who \ndrive through our State as does this body. That is really what it is \nall about. It is not a question of doing away with speed limits. It is \na question of having the opportunity to tailor needs to different kinds \nof places, the opportunities to deal with the differences in the needs \nof New Jersey and the needs of Wyoming.\n  So, there is a principle involved here. Obviously, our 100,000-square \nmile State with 450,000 people is quite different from New York, quite \ndifferent from Connecticut. So we need to have the flexibility, in a \nunion of this kind, to do that. This is a clear step away from the \nWashington-knows-best approach and I strongly endorse it. State leaders \nin Departments of Transportation do not need this constant oversight \nthat we have had here.\n  So, this is a good bill and one that needs to be passed in a timely \nfashion. It deserves strong support. It has had a great deal of input, \na great deal of conversation from States, a great deal of communication \nwith State Highway Departments and others. So I encourage all my \ncolleagues to vote for the bill. I hope the President will sign it \npromptly so that the States can finally receive the money that does, \nindeed, belong to them.\n  Mr. President, I urge quick passage of this bill and its quick \nmovement through the White House and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Gorton). Who yields time?\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, we are ready for the Senator from \nDelaware.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I rise to speak to the motion-- I will \nwithhold sending it to the desk at the moment--that I intended to \noffer.\n  Mr. President, I rise today to express my deep concern and, quite \nfrankly, disappointment that this conference report comes back to us \nwithout an important Senate provision that enjoyed very strong, \nbipartisan support in the Senate.\n  On June 21, by a vote of 64 to 36, the Senate voted to give our State \nGovernors the option to use some of their Federal highway funds on \nintercity rail, that is for Amtrak. It was a proposal that Senator Roth \nand I introduced, along with Senators Boxer, Chafee, Cohen, Jeffords, \nKerry, Lautenberg, Leahy, Moynihan, Murray, Specter, Pell, Snowe, and \nD'Amato.\n  I point out to my colleagues that these are States with varying \ndegrees of Amtrak service. As a matter of fact, the Governors of those \nStates which have a limited amount of Amtrak service, have the greatest \nconcern about being given this additional flexibility. The bottom line \nhere is Amtrak has, as the distinguished chairman of the committee \nknows, out of necessity made some significant cuts in its operations \nover the last couple of years, in a sense downsized the number of \ntrains it runs as well as the number of personnel that it has. The \nresult of that has not affected, much, the Northeast corridor, where \npeople have significant access to rail. But it has affected States like \nMontana, it has affected States like Vermont, it has affected States \nlike Mississippi, because they have lost trains because we could not \njustify their cost based on these new, incredible restrictions placed \nupon Amtrak.\n  I might note, by the way, although the reigning expert is on the \nfloor--the Senator from Rhode Island--that I do not know of any \nnational rail system in the world, as a passenger rail system, that \nruns on operating costs, on the money that it takes in. Everybody comes \nover and my conservative and liberal colleagues--there are not many \nliberals left--but my conservative colleagues come back from Japan and \nGermany or Europe and they say, ``Boy, we rode on these trains and they \nwere something else. Why do we not have trains like that?''\n  They subsidize them, like we do the airlines. They subsidize them, \nlike we do the highways. None of them make it based on the fare \neveryone pays. There would not be any airlines running, we could not \nafford any ticket, if the fare we paid did not cover the air traffic \ncontrollers, covered the runways, covered the towers, covered the \nplaces we land. They are subsidized. But, somehow--I am not speaking to \nanybody on the floor here in particular, because I know the Senator \nfrom Rhode Island is a champion of rail as well as highways--somehow, \nwe look at the Amtrak ticket and say, ``Boy, they are really \nsubsidized,'' because we have a direct appropriation and everybody can \nsee it.\n  At any rate, what happened was in a number of States, like the State \nof Montana, officials said, ``Look, there are one or two trains that \nrun across Montana, that go across the Northwest to the State of the \nPresiding Officer, and we cannot justify, based on passenger load, \nkeeping that train going.'' Or the Vermonter, that goes up into \nVermont, or the Crescent, that goes down to New Orleans and goes \nthrough Mississippi. It is kind of hard when you say you have to go out \nand cut--they are the ones which are cut.\n  So all of a sudden Republican and Democratic Governors, like the \nRepublican Governor from Pennsylvania, Governor Ridge, a former \nCongressman, said, ``Wait a minute, we need these trains going across. \nNot the ones going to Harrisburg and Pittsburgh and so on and so \nforth,'' the Governors of these other, various States agreed. So what \nwe did was we came along with nothing particularly radical here. The \namendment I am talking about, the flexibility amendment, was not \ndesigned to fix every problem that Amtrak has. It was not designed to \nmake Amtrak solvent. It was not designed to solve any intercity rail \nproblem that is going to exist because there are larger problems and \nthere are larger costs. But, by providing the States some flexibility \nin allocating their Federal transportation funds, although not intended \nto be a final solution to Amtrak's problems, it was a partial solution \nto the problems the States had, the Governors had. So, increasing the \nState flexibility was an important goal.\n  By the way, under the leadership of Senator Chafee and Senator \nMoynihan and the votes of the vast majority of Members here, we made a \nsignificant departure, a necessary but significant departure a couple \nof years ago when we passed the new highway bill, the so-called ISTEA. \n\n[[Page S17222]]\n\n  What that said was basically this. If, in a State, you decide to \nabate the air quality problems you have, or to deal with congestion, or \nto deal with rural transportation problems, out of your Highway Trust \nFund moneys that you get you can go out and you can, instead of \nbuilding a new lane of a highway, you can subsidize a bus or you can \nsubsidize a bus route from Dover, DE, to Dagsboro, DE, instead building \na new highway. It is cheaper and makes more sense.\n  The leaders on this have been Senators Chafee and Moynihan. They said \nit does not make any sense to insist that States have to pour more \nconcrete. They can say, ``OK, we want to put a bike path in. We can \nspend money for that, or for buses, if it is going to improve the air \nquality, instead of more lanes for cars.''\n  It gave flexibility to the States. It was only a portion of the \nhighway money they received. So all this amendment did, and I think the \nreason why it enjoyed such wide support, was to just logically extend \nthat flexibility. The goal of the Senate amendment, which was dropped \nin conference, was not to shift the burden of passenger rail services \nin the States. It was to allow the States to have another alternative \nto deal with their problems.\n  For some, this means a small portion of their highway money--I say \nthat because to use the vernacular the cement and asphalt guys out \nthere said, ``Oh, my. They are going to be able to spend money on \nsomething other than laying concrete or laying down asphalt.'' They can \nstill lay billions of dollars worth of concrete and asphalt across this \nNation under the flexibility amendment.\n  This is not a backdoor to do away with the highways. This is a \nprovision to give flexibility to the States. And it does not require an \nadditional penny. It just says the States can use some of it. Instead \nof building a bicycle path, they can say in Vermont, we want to keep \nthat train that comes up into Vermont from the Northeast corridor, and \nbrings us millions of dollars worth of skiers every year, improves our \neconomy, and has a significant impact on health of our State. We want \nto use some of our highway money to pay Amtrak to say, ``Look, put that \ntrain back on. We will pay for it. The rails are already there. We will \npay for it.''\n  Because they understand this, the Governors of our States are \nactively seeking to keep Amtrak running. The Republican Governors from \nWisconsin, Michigan, and Pennsylvania, and the Democratic Governors, \nalso, feel very strongly about this.\n  The Senate language dropped in conference would have provided those \nGovernors the means, if they chose, to support Amtrak routes important \nto their States. Specifically, it would have made Amtrak an eligible \nuse for funds from two areas--the so-called STP fund, Surface \nTransportation Program, which is known as STP around here; funds to be \nused for most kinds of roads and highways, as well as capital costs for \nbus terminals, car pool projects, bicycle and pedestrian facilities, \nhike and bike trails. Right now, under the Surface Transportation \nProgram, you can expend money, if you are Governor, from your highway \ntrust fund to build a bus terminal. You can spend your money from the \nhighway trust fund to build a bike or hike trail, a bicycle path, or a \npedestrian path. You can do all of that. You can even spend the money \nfor promoting car pooling, all of which makes sense.\n  But the one thing you cannot do is you cannot say--even though you \nhave a railroad track running through your State where you want it to \ngo--Amtrak, if you can put an extra train on there, we will pay you for \nthat. Why? It makes no sense.\n  So the Senate language added intercity rail--translated, Amtrak--to \nthat list of things that Governors can do consistent with the aims of \nthe program to support and fully fund an integrated transportation \nsystem. Integrated means highways. It means buses. It means subways. It \nmeans Amtrak, if this were to prevail. It gives them flexibility.\n  The second thing the Governors could do, in addition to going to the \nso-called STP fund--is go to the congestion mitigation and air quality \nfund, or, the so-called CMAQ fund. CMAQ is an innovative program \ndesigned by Senators Moynihan and Chafee which supposed to help urban \nareas come into compliance with the Clean Air Act.\n  Mr. President, we all know in most of our States where we are told \nthat, if the air quality is not particularly good, the Governor is told \nto take the necessary steps in order to meet the Clean Air Act \nstandards. This gives the Governor an opportunity when managing a \ngrowing State, a growing community and a growing urban area, to say, \nOK, one of the ways I can deal with increased congestion is, instead of \nputting more cars on the highway, to increase intercity rail.\n  Let us imagine what would happen if we shut down Amtrak in the \nNortheast corridor? Those of you, the tourists here today, traveling I-\n95 from here up to Boston through the States of Maryland, Delaware, \nPennsylvania, New Jersey, New York, Connecticut, Rhode Island, can you \nimagine? How many more lanes can we add on to I-95 in order to just \ntransport people up and down? How many more airplanes can we add? We \nare having problems with airports. There is so much traffic on the east \ncoast they are talking about the State of Delaware and the Wilmington \nairport becoming an overflow facility for the Philadelphia airport.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. BIDEN. Sure. I am delighted to.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. The Senator mentions aviation and the problems, if we \ndid not have Amtrak operating. The projection is that, if Amtrak were \nnot operating, we would have 10,000 DC-9 flights a year more to \naccommodate the traffic that would come off of Amtrak.\n  Mr. BIDEN. I say to my friend from New Jersey, Mr. President, that \nstatistic makes the point. Two of the three people who know most about \nthe transportation problems in this country are right here in the \nChamber now, and the Senator from New Jersey is one of them. Ten \nthousand additional flights. We are having trouble keeping airports \nopen during certain hours so people cannot have them interfere with \ntheir living standard and the quality of life. Where are they going to \ngo, and why are we doing this? Why are we failing to make this small \nchange in flexibility?\n  I never impugn the motive of anybody on this floor. But I must tell \nyou in my 23 years here I have not run across many lobbies that are \nmore powerful than the highway lobby, than the cement folks and the \nasphalt folks. There is nothing bad about them. But I think they are \nbeing incredibly shortsighted here in terms of not allowing this \nflexibility. I think in the long run, in 2 years, or 10 years, the \npublic is going to say, ``Enough, I do not want a 17-lane highway \nrunning by my house.''\n  To combat this growing concern, Mr. President, these CMAQ funds, that \nthe States receive as part of their highway funds, could be used for \nAmtrak, at the discretion of the Governors, if they chose to mitigate \ncongestion and to carry the same number of people with less pollution \nand cars on the highways. Surely, this would be an appropriate use of \nthose funds, a use currently denied the States.\n  In addition to those provisions, Mr. President, this amendment would \npermit States to enter into interstate compacts to support the Amtrak \nservices. For example, the Presiding Officer is from the great State of \nWashington. You cannot very well get a train to go to Washington coming \nfrom Chicago unless you get the folks in the Dakotas, Montana, and \nIdaho to let it get there. There is no other way to get it there. If \nthey do not have the ability to come up with the funds to provide for \nthat train coming through, then it is a problem.\n  So it allows, if they so choose, the States in the Northwest to enter \ninto a compact if they want those trains to move from Chicago to the \nState of Washington with more frequency. States come up with their own \nmoney, come up with the money they want out of their highway funds, if \nthey decide to do so.\n  In the long run the answer to Amtrak's financial problems are not \nsolved by this amendment. It will come from clearly defined, dedicated \nsources of funds supporting capital means. That is the only way out for \nAmtrak.\n  I must say that I am pleased to note that Senator Roth has taken an \namendment that he and I supported, and has drafted just such a bill \nwhich \n\n[[Page S17223]]\nhas come out of the Finance Committee which he chairs. I look forward \nto working with him, and dealing with that bill on another occasion in \nthe near future. It has to do with setting up a trust fund, a very \nsmall one, so that Amtrak will have the funds it needs for necessary \ncapital improvements. The Senator from Montana supports that as well.\n  But, Mr. President, this flexibility proposal was taken out I think \nfor very shortsighted reasons--not for lack of support of Senator \nChafee, who stood his ground as long as he could in this conference. It \nwas dropped because the House was adamant in refusing to give the \nStates the needed flexibility to manage their transportation needs the \nway they should do best. As a matter of fact, the chairman in the House \non this committee, a gentleman from Pennsylvania, a very, very \ntenacious, very good Congressman, works very hard, even resisted to \nconsent to the entreaties of his Governor telling them he needed \nthis. And so I in no way am suggesting that the Senate did not try its \nbest to hold this provision.\n\n  The House just adamantly refused to give the States flexibility. So \nmuch for the revolution. So much for the devolution of power away from \nWashington to the States. Here we have an example on the limits of \nrevolutionary fervor; it ends when the committee is threatened with a \ntiny, marginal loss of authority or it ends where important interests \nto the highway community decide they want it to end.\n  The Senate language that was dropped would not spend one dime of \nadditional State or Federal money--not one dime of additional money. It \nwould not require the States to spend any funds on Amtrak, not a single \npenny, if they did not want to. It would not change any formula for \ndistributing or allocating transportation funds among the States. It \nwould not affect the amount of annual Federal transportation funds \nStates now receive individually or in total.\n  The bottom line is the Senate amendment simply permitted States to \nuse funds they already qualify for in a way that is not currently \npermitted. Current restrictions on the use of Federal transportation \nfunds would be removed and Governors around the country would be able \nto use those funds as they see fit, including in support of intercity \nrail services provided by Amtrak, if this amendment were to prevail. In \nvery congested areas, particularly in urban corridors along the east \nand west coasts, but in other areas as well, adding more highways in \ncertain areas is simply not an economic or environmental option. \nKeeping an Amtrak route open on existing rail right-of-way, which is \nmuch more cost effective and safer and cleaner than buying land to \nconstruct even one more lane on a major interstate highway, is the way \nto go. The increasing flexibility provided by the Senate amendment is \nfully consistent with the major goals of the national highway safety \nbill before us today and with ISTEA, the landmark legislation that \ncalls for a National Highway System designation.\n  The need for enhanced State flexibility is clear. I find it \nfascinating that my colleagues, some of whom spoke today, colleagues \nwho I have great respect for from wide open spaces of the West, from \nMontana and Wyoming, talk about the need for us to consider their \nspecific needs and afford them flexibility, allowing them to have a \nhighway speed limit higher than might be appropriate in the middle of \nPhiladelphia County in Philadelphia, PA, or in the middle of Newark, \nNJ.\n  I understand that and appreciate that, but I have always found it \ndifficult to understand how they cannot appreciate the problems of \nurban States where it makes much less sense for us to go out and build \nadditional highways than it does for us to allow the States to have \nflexibility to use some of those moneys, designated portions of them, \nfor the purpose of making sure we meet air quality standards, safety \nstandards, and the transportation needs of the people of our State.\n  Let States decide. Let States decide. This is the mandate set out in \nboth the House and Senate budget resolutions which we are going to hear \na lot about today. Let the devolution of power occur; send it back to \nthe States.\n  This whole thing is also a mandate that sets out for Amtrak \nauthorizing legislation that we are going to take up very soon.\n  The first stage of this new authorizing legislation for Amtrak was \nannounced last December with major routes elimination taking place \neffective in April, frequency reductions in the selection of routes \nthroughout the country that will be completed this coming October.\n  The bottom line is more States will have less service in areas that \nthey need and that they could very well be willing to use highway funds \nto keep. As a result, many communities across the country find \nthemselves with little or no interstate rail service, and the Governors \nof those States know that intercity rail is an important option for \nsmall towns without air service as well as for congested commuter \ncorridors. They know that intercity rail supports commerce and is an \nimportant component of the modern national transportation system.\n  Last June, I entered into the Record a letter from Governor Dean of \nVermont, Governor Thompson of Wisconsin, Governor Engler of Michigan, \nGovernor Carper of Delaware, and subsequently Governor Ridge of \nPennsylvania, Democrats and Republicans alike, asking for this \nflexibility.\n  Among the authors of that letter were Governors who had already \ncommitted their own State general revenues to support intercity rail \nroutes and at the same time they had surpluses in their Federal \ntransportation program that they are prohibited from using, that is, \nmoney that went back to the States they could not use because they did \nnot want to build more highways. I said, ``Can't we use that for \nthis?'' They said, ``No, you can't.'' So they are required to go into \nthe general funds of their States. That seems to me to be \ncounterproductive. Many States have confirmed the importance of Amtrak.\n  Today, Mr. President, I have a letter from those same Governors, \njoined by Governor Allen of Virginia, another Republican, along with \nadditional letters from Governor Whitman of New Jersey, reinforcing \ntheir support for the Roth-Biden amendment in the Senate version of the \nNational Highway System bill. These letters were sent in October, \nunfortunately to no avail. They were sent to Congressman Shuster, chair \nof the House Transportation Committee and leader of the House \nconferees. I ask unanimous consent these letters be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the letters were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                 October 20, 1995.\n     Hon. Bud Shuster,\n     Chairman, House Committee on Transportation and \n         Infrastructure, House of Representatives, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Shuster: As you continue to work with the \n     Senate towards completion of the National Highway System \n     bill, we want you to be aware our strong support for the \n     right of states to use their federal transportation funds for \n     rail passenger service. The so called ``Roth-Biden'' \n     provision which was included in S. 440 by a vote of 64-36 has \n     our full and enthusiastic support, and we urge you to support \n     its inclusion in the final NHS bill.\n       As you are aware, under present law, we are not able to \n     make use of our federal highway or transit funds for rail \n     passenger service. Enactment of this provision will provide \n     states with the ability to decide what transportation system \n     best meets their needs and to allocate their federal funds \n     accordingly. In this time of severe budget constraints at all \n     levels of government, it is essential that we empower state \n     and local officials to make the best use of scarce federal \n     resources.\n       We view this inclusion of the Both/Biden provision in the \n     final version of the NHS bill as an extremely positive step \n     in the direction of achieving a higher level of state choice \n     and a more balanced transportation system. We look forward to \n     working with you to ensure this result.\n           Sincerely,\n     Gov. Howard Dean.\n     Gov. George Allen.\n     Gov. Gaston Caperton.\n     Gov. John Engler.\n     Gov. Tom Carper.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n\n                                          State of New Jersey,\n\n                                    Trenton, NJ, October 20, 1995.\n     Hon. Bud Shuster,\n     Chairman, House Committee on Transportation and \n         Infrastructure, House of Representatives, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Shuster: As you continue to work with the \n     Senate towards completion of the National Highway System \n     bill, I want you to be aware of my strong support for the \n     right of states to use their federal transportation funds for \n     rail passenger service. The so called ``Roth-Biden'' \n     provision, which was included in S. 440 by a vote of 64-36, \n     has my \n\n[[Page S17224]]\n     full and enthusiastic support, and I urge you to support its inclusion \n     in the final NHS bill.\n       As you are aware, under present law, we are not able to \n     make use of our federal highway or transit funds for rail \n     passenger service. Enactment of this provision will provide \n     states with the ability to decide what transportation system \n     best meets their needs, and to allocate their federal funds \n     accordingly. In this time of severe budget constraints at all \n     levels of government, it is essential that we empower state \n     and local officials to make the best use of scarce federal \n     resources.\n       The inclusion of the Both/Biden provision in the final \n     version of the NHS bill is an extremely positive step in the \n     direction of achieving a higher level of state choice, and a \n     more balanced transportation system. I look forward to \n     working with you to ensure this result.\n           Yours sincerely,\n                                           Christine Todd Whitman,\n                                                         Governor.\n\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, because the support is still out there and \nbecause the need for Amtrak services must still be met by the States \nand because the principle of increased State flexibility is still \nvalid, I will continue to fight for this Senate language that has been \ndropped from the conference report. But because I do not want to waste \nmore time on this proposal and tie up my friend, the chairman of the \ncommittee, who I again thank for his dogged support of this proposition \nat a time when so much of our legislative business is yet to be done, I \nwill not introduce this motion to recommit. But I consider the loss of \nimportant Senate language a clear reason for me to vote against this \nconference report.\n  I also want my colleagues to know that I will seek another means by \nwhich to accomplish the goals of the Roth-Biden amendment, and I will \ncontinue to fight to get it put into law.\n  To put it to you very bluntly, Mr. President, the reason I am not \ngoing to pursue this right now is if this prevails and gets sent back \nto committee, these States that are looking for the flexibility will \nalso in the meantime have additional moneys tied up. They will not be \nable to get moneys that are in this bill that they need now. So I am in \nkind of a catch-22 position. My purpose here is to help Amtrak and to \ngive Governors of States flexibility to decide what their \ntransportation network should look like. But if I succeed, it goes back \nto the House again and goes back into conference, and I am not at all \nsure, to be very blunt about it, whether or not my friend from Rhode \nIsland, notwithstanding his Herculean efforts, would be able to prevail \nwere we to send him back. So that is why I am withholding this motion. \nSo I will yield.\n  I saw my colleague from Delaware, who is the lead sponsor on this \namendment. I do not know whether he wishes to speak on this right now. \nBut for the time being--is there any time under the control of the \nSenator from Delaware?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware has 3 minutes 40 \nseconds.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I will reserve the remainder of my time and \nyield the floor.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I believe that I have some time remaining.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey has 18 minutes 40 \nseconds remaining.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Eighteen?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Eighteen minutes forty seconds left.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  I just want to stand up and announce my support of the comments and \nthe program that the distinguished Senator from Delaware outlined in \nterms of where he would like to see things go for Amtrak. I, too, am an \nactive proponent of Amtrak because its part in our intermodal \ntransportation system is so significant.\n  I note, Mr. President, that when I was chairman of the Transportation \nSubcommittee of Appropriations--and that was the situation until the \nbeginning of this year--that whenever there was an opportunity to \nreview another transportation bill, invariably colleagues would come \nand plead with me for continued service by Amtrak to their States, even \nthose States that had a couple of trains a week going through there.\n  They all loved the notion that Amtrak, the intercity rail system, the \nnational passenger rail service, was going to continue providing \nservice. Well, we have seen cutback after cutback, narrowing this thing \ndown. And in these days of spare resources, I think it made sense to \nreview very closely what was taking place there and to avoid as much as \npossible the continued costs for the operations of Amtrak.\n  However, Amtrak stands alone in terms of the percentage of the fare \nbox that is received among railroads across the world. Amtrak has the \nhighest share of revenues per fare box of any railroad in any country \non Earth.\n  So, I fight very hard to protect the ability of Amtrak to function. \nAnd I know that is true of my colleagues from Rhode Island, including \nthe distinguished chairman of the Environment and Public Works \nCommittee, as well as other colleagues who see the value of Amtrak as \npart of the transportation system and who look at the possibilities \nthat might exist if Amtrak was not functioning.\n\n  The distinguished Senator from Delaware talked about aviation. I \npoint out that we would need 10,000 flights a year, additional flights \na year, DC-9 size, just to service the volume of traffic that Amtrak \nnow handles. If Amtrak can improve its service, get higher speed \nservice, make the capital investments to bring that system up to the \nlevel that it ought to be, it would carry even more passengers. A \ncomputer permutation shows exactly that.\n  Here we are, when we have a chance, when we give the Governors--we \ntalk about States' rights, and we talk about giving the States the \nchance to make their own decisions. Here we have a chance to do it. \nWhen it was supported in the Senate by a vote of 64-36, we lose it in \nconference. Frankly, I think that is a terrible condition. I was \ndisappointed that it was believed that we could maintain the integrity \nof the highway trust fund by receding from the Senate position on \nAmtrak flexibility.\n  Simply, this provision would have allowed the States the discretion \nto use a small portion of their highway formula funds for Amtrak \nexpenses. I sponsored this same amendment when ISTEA was being \ndeveloped and when it passed the Senate. So, when it comes to Amtrak, \nwhen it comes to motorcycles--when it comes to Amtrak, we do not say \nthat the States know best. We say Washington knows best. And that is an \nanomaly that, frankly, I do not understand.\n  Mr. President, I feel that we have lost an excellent opportunity \nhere. I hope that we will be able to recapture it along the way with \nother legislation, as indicated by the Senator from Delaware. As the \nranking member of the Transportation Appropriations Subcommittee, I can \ntell my colleagues that the appropriations bill that the President \nsigned the other night included a 25-percent cut in Amtrak's operating \nsubsidy; $137 million in a single year will be cut.\n  Without having to be a rocket scientist, it is obvious these cuts \nwill cause another round of service cuts, another round of layoffs. \nAmtrak just completed the largest round of service cuts and layoffs in \nits history. Now we are going to look again at another round of service \ncuts, another round of layoffs.\n  This NHS bill was held to be minimizing these cuts, to allow the \nNation's Governors to use their discretion, to enter into cost-sharing \nagreements with Amtrak and keep certain of these trains running. I am \nsure that those Members that insist that we deny the Governors this \nform of flexibility will be the same persons who complain when they \nendure additional losses in Amtrak service and additional losses in \nAmtrak employment.\n\n  Mr. President, while I have the floor, I just want to reiterate--and \nI will not be long in deference to my colleagues who are waiting for \nthe floor--that I think the NHS bill is a very positive piece of \nlegislation in general, that it provides additional investments in \ninfrastructure, which I repeat that I strongly support, but as we look \nat the abandonment of safety, we have to also consider what happens in \nterms of not only the loss of limb and life, but the additional \nfinancial costs that are associated with it. We also have to look at \nthe fact that we will help create more air pollution as we load up \nfurther highway travel. We will be looking \n\n[[Page S17225]]\nat depending more on imported oil from the Middle East. That is a \ntragic situation for us.\n  More danger to law enforcement people. Put a patrol car out there \nhaving to enforce the law with someone going 90 miles an hour. I assure \nyou that no policeman's family is going to like that assignment. But \nhere we are. We are abandoning all other good judgment to save minutes \na day. It is a regrettable thing, again, because this is tagged onto a \ngood piece of legislation. But those who believe that safety is not a \nsignificant factor have abandoned that at this juncture. And I \nsincerely regret it.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I was deeply disappointed that the \nconferees dropped the provision that would have let States invest \nlimited amounts of highway funds for intercity passenger rail service. \nThis reasonable amendment would have given States like Vermont some \nflexibility to start or continue Amtrak service.\n  Last December, Amtrak made the painful decision to terminate the \nMontrealer, Vermont's only passenger rail service. Over the ensuing \nmonths, a unique partnership developed between the State of Vermont and \nAmtrak that resulted in an improved, cost-effective train, the \nVermonter. The Vermonter has become a success story for Vermont and for \nAmtrak. Ridership has dramatically increased since its inception, a new \nbaggage car has made the train more attractive to skiers and \nbicyclists, and the train operates at less than half the cost of the \nMontrealer.\n  The Vermonter's existence is largely due to the State of Vermont, \nwhich agreed last spring to pay up to $750,000 to subsidize the route \nfor 1 year. This subsidy represents a heavy commitment for my small \nState. As the Congress continues to cut Amtrak's budget, reallocated \nAmtrak costs are going to be passed on to Vermont in the form of a \nhigher subsidy, which could well make the Vermonter unaffordable for \nVermont.\n  This is why this amendment was so important for Vermont and other \nStates. We subsidize highway construction with billions of taxpayer \ndollars every year. This modest provision would have allowed States \nsome flexibility to use a small portion of those funds for Amtrak \nservice. I am disappointed that the Senate conferees allowed this \nprovision to be dropped in conference.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I ask how much time I have left?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 9 minutes 55 seconds.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor.\n  Mr. CHAFEE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, first, I see the distinguished Democratic \nSenator from Delaware here. I want to say everything he said was \nexactly right. It was an overwhelming vote on the floor to permit the \nStates to give money to Amtrak, that this was the ultimate of \nflexibility, which is the big war cry around this place. But we have \ndiscovered when it comes to flexibility, there is a great deal of \nflexibility in interpreting what is flexible. There was no movement in \nthe House on this. It was very, very--they were adamant.\n  All I can say is I think what this country needs is a transportation \ntrust fund, not a highway trust fund. I know that the distinguished \nchairman of the Finance Committee is going to speak in a few minutes, \nand I believe he has thoughts in the same manner.\n  But clearly we have to do something about Amtrak. We cannot just make \nthe cuts that the distinguished Senator from New Jersey was talking \nabout, $137 million. As the Senator from Delaware said, every railroad \ntransportation system in the world is subsidized, and for us to think \nthat we can get away without subsidizing Amtrak is nonsense. However, \nwe would not have a bill here today if we hung to our position that was \nvoted here on the floor.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I thank Senator Warner, Congressman Shuster, \nand the other conferees for agreeing to include a provision in the \nNational Highway System bill ensuring that public highways connecting \nthe NHS to ports, airports, and other intermodal transportation \nfacilities will be eligible for NHS funds without further delay.\n  One of the main reasons for creating the NHS was to establish \nintermodal facility connections. But few of the connectors are included \non the current NHS map and the Department of Transportation is not \nexpected to have a list of additional connectors ready until after \nenactment of this legislation. To ensure that NHS funding for the \nconnectors on DOT's list is not further delayed, the bill makes them \neligible for such assistance on an interim basis. While I would have \npreferred the Senate passed bill language, this provision represents a \nreasonable compromise and should achieve the same results.\n  There is one matter dealing with the interim eligibility provision on \nwhich I would appreciate the chairman's clarification, however. The \nprovision refers to a project to construct a connector to an intermodal \ntransportation facility. It is my understanding that the word \n``construct'' is to be read very broadly to include not only \nconstruction and reconstruction projects, but also ones involving \nresurfacing, restoration, rehabilitation, and operational improvements, \nsuch as the installation of traffic surveillance and control equipment \nand computerized signal systems.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. The understanding of the Senator from Missouri is \ncorrect. The word ``construct'' is to be read very broadly to include \nthe types of projects the Senator have just described.\n  Mr. BOND. I thank the chairman for this clarification.\n\n\n                      Unanimous-Consent Agreement\n\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, this has been cleared with the Democratic \nleader. I ask unanimous consent that the vote on the adoption of the \nconference report to accompany S. 440 occur at 1:15 p.m. today, with \nparagraph 4 of rule XII waived; and further, that immediately following \nthat vote, notwithstanding receipt of the conference report to \naccompany H.R. 2491, that the time consumed then be counted against the \nstatutory time limit provided for in the conference report and each \nstatement only occur as time is yielded by the managers or their \ndesignees.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, have the yeas and nays been ordered?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the unanimous-consent \nrequest?\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. No.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I ask the question again--I am sorry--are the yeas \nand nays ordered?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. They have not been ordered.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I yield 7 minutes to the distinguished \nSenator from Delaware.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island does not have 7 \nminutes.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. I was wondering if the Senator from New Jersey would give \nme a bit of his time.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. How much time do I have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Nine minutes fifty-two seconds.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I wanted to offer 2 minutes to the distinguished \nSenator from Arkansas. I will be happy to yield 7 minutes from my time \nto the distinguished Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. I have 5 minutes. Why do we not give him----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Four minutes remain for the Senator from Rhode \nIsland.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Three from you.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. I wonder if the senior Senator from Delaware will allow \nme 2 minutes to ask the manager a question.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. And the Senator has the time.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. This morning, I heard the Senator from Rhode Island \ntalking about the provision in the bill that changes the law that \nprohibits States from putting new billboards on scenic highways. I was \nadamantly opposed to the section of the bill that would turn this \nauthority back to the States. We have a magnificent highway \n\n[[Page S17226]]\nin my State. When complete, it is going to be one of the most \nbeautiful--if not the most beautiful--scenic highways in America.\n  I am not sure what the distinguished floor manager said this morning \non that provision about the Secretary's right to override the States on \nthis. Could the Senator clarify that for me?\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Here is the situation. As the Senator knows, I very \nstrongly supported the provision that we have in the law that says on \nscenic byways--and by the way, a scenic byway is designated by the \nState. It is not Big Brother from the Federal Government that \ndesignates them. The States designate the scenic byways, and then the \nFederal Government gives some moneys to help them.\n  By the way, the provision we have is no new billboards on scenic \nbyways, no new billboards. The question came up on segmentation. You \ncould have a 40-mile scenic byway, then a commercial section of 2 miles \nmaybe, and then 30 more miles of scenic byway. The question was, could \nyou segment these things?\n  The answer was, we included a provision that you could segment it \nwithout getting ridiculous; in other words, having a 2-mile stretch and \nthen 4 miles of billboards and then another 2-mile stretch. So we \nbelieve that what we came up with protects the existing situation.\n  The words that the Senator was referring to was permitting the \nSecretary of Transportation to have the authority to prevent actions by \nthe State that overrode the Federal requirements that prevented \nbillboards. In other words, this was something to ensure that these \nStates cannot set claim it is a scenic byway and instead it is a \nbillboard alley.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Does the Senator from Rhode Island feel that this \nsufficiently protects existing law?\n  Mr. CHAFEE. I do. We spent a lot of time with the highway \nadministrator and with his folks. We believe that what we have written \ninto the law now is exactly the way the situation is interpreted \ncurrently.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. I thank the Senator very much, and I thank the Senator \nfrom Delaware for allowing me to speak.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, as the author of the Amtrak amendment, I \ncannot overemphasize my extreme disappointment that the National \nHighway System conference report does not include this amendment. This \namendment passed overwhelmingly in the Senate by a vote of 64 to 36. In \nApril, when I introduced the Intercity Rail Investment Act with 13 \ncosponsors, I thought I had an approach that would be acceptable to all \nparties. I find it difficult to understand the objection to this \nproposal. As others have pointed out, in other countries, a viable rail \nsystem has always depended upon Government aid.\n\n  Frankly, when I offered the Roth-Biden amendment to the National \nHighway System bill, it was overwhelmingly approved, as I thought it \nwould be. While my amendment received strong support in this body, it, \nunfortunately, ran into difficulty on the House side in the conference.\n  Mr. President, my amendment would have given States the flexibility \nto use a portion of their Federal transportation dollars for passenger \nrail service, and it would have provided States with the ability to \ndecide what transportation system would best meet their needs and allow \nthem to allocate their Federal funds accordingly.\n  In a time of budget constraints, my amendment would have empowered \nState and local officials to make the best use of their Federal \nresources and, as has been pointed out, one of the things that we have \nbeen seeking to do in bringing about change in Government is to provide \nflexibility to State and local officials to make the best use of the \nFederal resources that they have available.\n  Sixty-four Senators agreed with me and voted in favor of my \namendment. Sixty-four Senators went on record for State choice, for a \nmore balanced transportation system. These Members know that Amtrak is \na vital and absolutely essential part of America's transportation \nnetwork. While the Senate position did not prevail in conference, I \nknow that Senator Chafee and other Members worked hard to convince the \nHouse how important this legislation is to our State Governors and to \nthe intermodal transportation system. I want to express my appreciation \nto Senator Chafee, and others, for what they did.\n  I appreciate their strong support for my amendment and we shall be \nback. We shall be back until we provide this kind of flexibility to our \nState officials.\n  Mr. President, the need for passenger rail service is clear. All one \nhas to do is look at our congested areas, particularly in the urban \ncorridors along the east and west coast. Adding more highways simply is \nnot an economic or viable option. In this part of the country, the \nNortheast corridor alone, annual Amtrak ridership between New York and \nWashington, DC, is the equivalent of 7,500 fully booked 757's, or \n10,000 fully booked DC-9's.\n  If Amtrak were to shut down, adding more highways simply would not be \na viable option. Just in the last year, Delaware alone had 607,000 \nriders.\n  We simply cannot have another system with that kind of capacity \nwithout adversely affecting our air quality and our land resources.\n  Mr. President, I know that my amendment would not have solved \nAmtrak's financial problems. Amtrak will need to continue to do its own \ninternal restructuring. It will also need a dedicated trust fund to \nsupport capital needs the way we provide capital for highways and \nairports.\n  As chairman of the Finance Committee, I recently reported out a bill \nthat would dedicate a half cent from the mass transit fund to Amtrak. \nThis measure would dedicate over $2 billion to Amtrak. As with the \nRoth-Biden Amtrak amendment, I am also eager to see this legislation \nenacted this year.\n  While I had hoped that my amendment would have been included in the \nconference report, I understand, having experienced some of them \nmyself, the constraints that Members must operate under in conference.\n  Mr. President, I will conclude by saying that if Congress hopes to \nprivatize Amtrak in the next 5 years, and if we support continued \nintercity passenger rail service--service that is vital to both rural \nand urban areas--we will vote in favor of a dedicated trust fund for \nAmtrak and for flexibility for State transportation spending on \npassenger rail service.\n  Mr. President, I am eager to work with my colleagues in the House and \nSenate to achieve this goal. Again, I thank Senator Chafee for his \ncooperation.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I have the remainder of Senator \nLautenberg's time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 2\\1/2\\ minutes.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I want to say to the distinguished Senator \nfrom Delaware, the chairman of the Finance Committee, that I agree with \neverything he said. I think that it was terribly unfortunate that we \ncould not get the House to budge. This was an absolute immovable \nposition that they had. I hope that we can set up this Amtrak trust \nfund.\n  Frankly, as I said before, I would like to see a national \ntransportation fund instead of a highway trust fund. Amtrak deserves \nevery bit of support we can give, for all the reasons that the \ndistinguished Senator from Delaware so ably set forth.\n  Mr. President, we are going to vote at 1:15.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum at this time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Grams). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, the hour of 1:15 having arrived, I \nbelieve, according to the prior agreement, we commence the vote on the \nNational Highway System conference report. Am I correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question occurs on agreeing to the \nconference report to S. 440. The yeas and nays have been ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  \n[[Page S17227]]\n\n  Mr. LOTT. I announce that the Senator from Texas [Mr. Gramm], the \nSenator from Arizona [Mr. McCain], and the Senator from New Hampshire \n[Mr. Smith] are necessarily absent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Are there any other Senators in the Chamber \nwho desire to vote?\n  The result was announced--yeas 80, nays 16, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 582 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--80\n\n     Abraham\n     Ashcroft\n     Baucus\n     Bennett\n     Bingaman\n     Bond\n     Boxer\n     Breaux\n     Brown\n     Bryan\n     Bumpers\n     Burns\n     Byrd\n     Campbell\n     Chafee\n     Coats\n     Cochran\n     Cohen\n     Conrad\n     Coverdell\n     Craig\n     D'Amato\n     Daschle\n     Dole\n     Domenici\n     Dorgan\n     Exon\n     Faircloth\n     Feingold\n     Ford\n     Frist\n     Glenn\n     Graham\n     Grams\n     Grassley\n     Gregg\n     Harkin\n     Hatch\n     Hatfield\n     Heflin\n     Helms\n     Hutchison\n     Inhofe\n     Inouye\n     Jeffords\n     Johnston\n     Kassebaum\n     Kempthorne\n     Kennedy\n     Kerrey\n     Kohl\n     Kyl\n     Levin\n     Lott\n     Lugar\n     Mack\n     McConnell\n     Mikulski\n     Moynihan\n     Murkowski\n     Murray\n     Nickles\n     Nunn\n     Pressler\n     Pryor\n     Reid\n     Robb\n     Rockefeller\n     Santorum\n     Sarbanes\n     Shelby\n     Simpson\n     Snowe\n     Specter\n     Stevens\n     Thomas\n     Thompson\n     Thurmond\n     Warner\n     Wellstone\n\n                                NAYS--16\n\n     Akaka\n     Biden\n     Bradley\n     DeWine\n     Dodd\n     Feinstein\n     Gorton\n     Hollings\n     Kerry\n     Lautenberg\n     Leahy\n     Lieberman\n     Moseley-Braun\n     Pell\n     Roth\n     Simon\n\n                             NOT VOTING--3\n\n     Gramm\n     McCain\n     Smith\n  So the conference report was agreed to.\n  Mr. CHAFEE.

Under the previous order, there will now be a \nperiod of debate on the conference report to accompany H.R. 2491, the \nBalanced Budget Act of 1995. Debate consumed during this period will be \ncounted against the 10-hour statutory time limit under the \nCongressional Budget Act.\n  Who yields time?\n  Mr. DOLE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n\n\n                           Order of Procedure\n\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I can indicate to our colleagues what the \nprogram is for today. We have a consent agreement that the time, as of \n5 minutes ago, the 10-hour statutory time on the conference report on \nthe Balanced Budget Act of 1995 started to run. We will not receive \nthat from the House until about 3 o'clock. In any event, the time has \nstarted running, and if we use all the time, we will vote about \nsometime after 11 o'clock tonight. If we do not use all the time, \nobviously, we will vote at an earlier time.\n  Anybody who would like to debate this particular subject, now is a \ngood time to start. If there is no indication of debate, why, we can be \nin recess subject to call of the Chair, whatever.\n  And on tomorrow, it will be HUD-VA, if available, and there may be \nanother CR tomorrow coming from the House, which will be a narrow CR \ndealing with Social Security, veterans, and Medicare, those three \ntopics. But we have to have consent over here before we can bring that \nup. If we put in a lot of amendments, we will not get it passed. These \nare subjects the President mentioned in his statement yesterday. That \nwill probably come over tomorrow.\n  I am somewhat doubtful the HUD-VA is going to make it. I do not think \nthey will finish in the House in time. That is sort of where we are. I \nhope we can have some resolution of the continuing resolution. I \nunderstand there are different people talking to different people about \ndifferent things.\n  [Laughter.]\n  I do not know whether they are going to get it resolved or not. Mr. \nPresident, I ask the minority leader if he has anything to add?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I share the majority leader's view that \nthis is a good time to begin the debate on the reconciliation bill. I \nknow a number of our colleagues have expressed an interest in beginning \nthe debate and have statements to make. I think we can proceed with \nthat and try to give them an update from time to time on what, if \nanything, the negotiations may be producing with regard to an agreement \non the CR.\n  Mr. DOLE. The time will be under the control of the Senator from New \nMexico and the Senator from Nebraska, or their designees.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Will the leader yield for a question?\n  Mr. DOLE. Sure.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, the Senator from Kansas [Mrs. Kassebaum] \nand I were going to introduce legislation, Kassebaum-Leahy legislation. \nI wonder at what point it will be an appropriate time.\n  Mr. DOLE. Right now.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I cannot speak for the Senator from Kansas on how much \ntime she needs, but I know I only need about 4 or 5 minutes.\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM. Mr. President, I do not need any longer, maybe even \nless than that. It is just to introduce some legislation.\n  Mr. DOLE. As far as I know, if there is no objection by the managers, \nit can be done right now.\n  Mr. EXON. I will be pleased to yield whatever time is necessary \nequally off the 10 hours.\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM. I thank the Chair.\n  (The remarks of Mrs. Kassebaum, Mr. Leahy, and Mr. Feingold \npertaining to the introduction of S. 1419 are located in today's Record \nunder ``Statements on Introduced Bills and Joint Resolutions.'')\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Gregg). The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, this is a historic day, in my opinion, \nin the life of our country. While we do not have the resolution, a \nbalanced budget amendment of 1995, over here from the House, yet I am \nholding the text of it in my hand.\n  Essentially today, in my opinion, we have finally cast aside years of \nirresponsibility. Today, we will keep our word to the American people. \nToday, for the first time in 25 years, the Congress of the United \nStates will approve the first balanced budget in more than 25 years.\n  Today, we will act like adults and give this Nation the grown-up \nleadership needed to protect its future and allow our children to \nprosper.\n  Leaders, it has been said, are the custodians of a nation, of its \nideals, its values, its hopes, and its aspirations-- those things which \nbind a nation and make it more than a mere aggregation of individuals. \nBy governing for today, it is obvious that it is much easier to just \ngovern for today than leading for the future. It does not take a great \ndeal of talent or courage to solve an immediate need. It is a lot \nharder to pave the pathway for the future.\n  Yet, we who serve in public office and those of us who do have a high \nresponsibility to protect a great nation's future, we must work on \nbehalf of those who will follow us, our children and our grandchildren. \nWhen the facts are clear, we must act in their behalf or we are not \nleaders. We are the trustees of the future and of their future, of \ntheir legacy, of their opportunities. Leadership requires courage. It \nrequires boldness and foresight to safeguard a nation's ambitions and \ncomfort and to confront its challenges.\n  We have tried to provide the leadership needed to throttle runaway \nFederal spending and give the American people the first balanced budget \nin more than a quarter century. That might not be much in the life of \nthis Nation, but essentially what we have rung up on the credit card is \nnow approaching $5 trillion.\n  So during that 25 years since we last had a balanced budget, we have \nmortgaged our future in a rather almost irreparable way. We better fix \nit, and fix it now.\n  So, for many of us who have thought this was the biggest \nsocioeconomic issue that our Nation has, this is a red-letter day. It \nis a day of great pride.\n  Now, there is no use kidding ourselves. What we have done is \ncontroversial and difficult. Obviously, the President says he will veto \nit. But it is also obvious that with that veto pen comes a high \nresponsibility. The shoulders of the President will have a very heavy \n\n[[Page S17228]]\nload on them as he exercises that veto pen, because the question will \nbe: When will we get a balanced budget, Mr. President? The question \nwill be: What is our legacy going to be to our children once we have \nplaced this in the hands of the President?\n\n  For it will now be up to him, sometime this evening or tomorrow when \nwe finish, it will be up to him, not us. But we will pass it here in \nthe Senate as it will pass in the U.S. House.\n  It has not been an easy road for scores of Senators. It has been a \ndifficult job politically for many Members on our side of the aisle. \nYes, we are getting beat about the head and shoulders. It has not been \neasy, perhaps, for today more people think we are not doing the right \nthing than think we are doing the right thing. But I believe when you \ndo great things and difficult things you have to take a little bit of \nthe heat for a while until it all sinks in, in terms of what you really \nhave accomplished.\n  Again, I repeat: Since we have accomplished it, it will be on the \nshoulders of the President; then, once it is vetoed, to accomplish \nsomething of equal value and of equal legacy for our people.\n  We knew from the beginning this would be difficult. We knew it would \nrequire determination and endurance, but we had promised the American \npeople that we would balance this budget and put an end to persistent \ndeficit spending that has been bleeding our Nation dry and leaving our \nchildren with less of a future than we had, which is not a good \nthought, not one we relish very much as adult leaders in the world's \ngreatest democracy and the world's greatest capitalist system, which \nhas produced more goods and wealth for our people and for the world \nthan any group of people living under any kind of government forever.\n  A deficit that is growing by $482 million a day, $335,000 a minute, \n$5,500 every second, and growing--our deficit spending is heaping \nmountains of debt upon our children. It will drag them down. We are \nirresponsible in shackling our children with our bills. If this pattern \nis left unchanged, they will be the first generation of Americans to \nsuffer a lower standard of living and less opportunity than their \nparents.\n\n  Yes, if we pass this budget, our budget, we can reverse that tide. We \ncan restore our Nation's fiscal equilibrium, and preserve America as a \nland of opportunity, not just for the ``now'' generation, but for \nfuture generations of children yet unborn.\n  Our budget reflects a commitment to responsibility, to generating \neconomic growth, creating family-wage jobs, and protecting the American \ndream for all our citizens, young and old. A balanced budget does not \njust mean a better future for our children. It will put more money in \nthe pockets of working Americans today. It will mean lower interest \nrates, cheaper mortgages, and lower car payments. With our budget in \nplace, working Americans will have an easier time sending their \nchildren to school or buying their first home.\n  Economists predict a balanced budget will result in a 2 point drop in \ninterest rates. That is a yearly $200 saving on a typical 10-year loan \nof $10,000, or $2,000. Over the life of a loan, a family will save \n$2,500 a year on a $100,000 mortgage on their home if this budget is \nbalanced. We owe it to the American people, and to those who live in \nour houses and make them their homes, to make it a little easier for \nthem to live in that style.\n  Studies conclude that a balanced budget will boost an average \nfamily's income. Others say it will create 2\\1/2\\ million new jobs. \nAnd, even as we move toward a balanced budget in 2002, under our \nbudget, Federal spending will continue to grow.\n  We will spend $12 trillion over the next 7 years; a number that is \nalmost unfathomable to most American citizens, and to many of us. That \nis only $890 billion less than we would have otherwise spent--around \n$900 billion less.\n  Also, we balance this budget without touching Social Security. The \nbudget shrinks the Federal bureaucracy, eliminating many Federal \nagencies and departments and programs. And, over time, to meet the \ntargets even more will have to be changed.\n  We move money and power out of Washington and back to citizens in \ntheir States and communities. This budget reform will also take care of \nan old, an ancient welfare system, for it, too, will be reformed. But, \nyet, we will maintain a safety net for those in true need, especially \nchildren.\n  It preserves and improves Medicare and it protects Medicare. In fact, \nthe way it is written in this document, we make the Medicare system \nsolvent for anywhere from 14 to 17 years instead of until the next \nelection, or just a few years.\n\n  I want to say to my colleagues who may not agree with every item in \nthis package, there may be some portions you would like to change. That \nmay happen. But I also want to remind you that this is an honest and \nstraightforward balanced budget. In the vernacular of past budget \ndebates, you may disagree but there is no smoke and no mirrors, no rosy \nscenarios, no cooking the books, just balancing the books. The \nPresident says he will veto this budget. As I said a few moments ago, I \nwish he would not. But I think I understand the game and I think I \nunderstand what the White House is up to. He says he is kinder and \ngentler and he is going to have a kinder and gentler budget, that \nsomehow magically gets to balance while spending about $300 billion \nmore in domestic programs. He says he can get to balance by spending \nmore and cutting less. It sounds a little bit phony. That is because \nthe President's so-called budget hides about $475 billion in the smoke \nand mirrors of different economic assumptions from those of the \nCongressional Budget Office, which dictates our economic assumptions \nand our costs of programming.\n  The President's document, in my opinion, is a political one, hastily \nthrown together last June in response to a Republican determined effort \nand our passage of the budget resolution which set the path for a \nbalanced budget. Yet, I understand sooner rather than later we will \nhave to work with our President to get a balanced budget. But I think \nit behooves us here, today, to make sure that the American people \nunderstand that we had a real balanced budget and when you look at it \nin its entirety, it is a pretty fair document. When you look at it, as \nto what it has accomplished that the people want, it preserves and \nprotects Medicare without any question. And for those who come to the \nfloor talking about increases in the costs, I remind them that even the \nPresident has recommended increased costs in Medicare. In fact, some of \nour experts will take to the floor and will bring to the people of the \ncountry the realization that most of the President's talk in the last 4 \nor 5 days about Medicare and not reducing and not cutting Medicare and \nnot increasing the fees that have to be paid by seniors--that, in fact, \nthe President has already recommended that we do that. Last year he \nrecommended it. This year he recommended it. I think there is only a \ncouple of dollars difference between his recommendations and ours.\n  So, I understand. We might have made a tactical mistake, assuming \nthat the President would not play politics with Medicare when we sent \ndown our last continuing resolution. But we set that aside for now. We \nwill take that up at another date, if in fact we are able to get to the \ntable with the President, if he makes sufficient commitment in advance \nso we know we are going to get there. For, obviously, we will not give \nuntil the President agrees to accept a continuing resolution that \nassures us we are going to go to the table, negotiating about a \nbalanced budget at a given time that we can all live with. We believe \nthat time is 7 years.\n\n  The reality is that throughout the debate we have had to drag along \nthe White House toward a balanced budget. I will not belabor it, but \nclearly the President produced a budget earlier this year that ignored \nthe deficit totally. Only after we had our determined effort of many \nmonths did he put together a balanced budget--allegedly a balanced \nbudget--put together very short shrift, a 21-page document, nine of \nwhich are graphs.\n  So, now the time is clear and it is right ahead of us. Sometime \ntonight or early tomorrow we will pass a historic document. It will \nalready have passed the House. And then the President of the United \nStates will have it firmly and squarely on his shoulders. I believe \nthere is hope. I am ready to meet with \n\n[[Page S17229]]\nbudget leaders at the White House any time, so they might join with us \nin fashioning a budget that gets to balance in 7 years. I am ready to \ndo it any time. But I believe it is far more important that, during the \nnext 24 hours, we pass this one, which is our marker, our marker for \nthis year and for the future. And I think just getting this budget \npassed will forever change the way we handle our citizens' tax dollars.\n  I believe we will have shown that excuses for a balanced budget are \nnot justified. Excuses merely mean we do not have the guts to do it, or \nthe courage to do it. But it can be done and it should be done. It may \nset the pattern for decades to come, that we do not spend--that we do \nnot go in deficit in good economic times, that we pay our bills in good \neconomic times so somebody else does not have to pay them, some other \nAmerican who did not even vote on any of this because they were not \naround, or they were too little, or too young, or not born yet.\n  So with this background, I believe we have before us a real important \nevent in American history. Later on, we will talk in more detail about \nwhat we actually did in Medicare and Medicaid and tax cuts. I will rely \non others to give their versions of it, but clearly I will be here \nduring the next 12 hours or so to give my version. Since I have tried \nas hard as I could to learn as much as I could about this, it is \nimportant to me that we get our message across and get it across well. \nI believe we will.\n  It is a pleasure working with Senator Exon. We do not agree on a lot \nof things, but I guarantee you, if Senator Exon and I were locked in a \nroom and told to come out with a balanced budget that was good, we \nmight shock some people. It might be right. For now, we are on other \nsides of the ledger, and I understand that.\n  Let me at the end of my remarks insert in the Record a document that \nI was anxious about the last 3 weeks. As we went through our conference \nand had to change a lot of things, I was very anxious that we get this \none document from the authenticator of budgets, the Congressional \nBudget Office, headed by Dr. June O'Neill, and this was directed to me \ndated November 16: ``Dear Mr. Chairman.'' In essence, it says this \nbudget reaches a balance in 2002 and has a surplus of $4 billion. That \nis the story.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the letter confirming and ratifying that \nbe made a part of the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                                    U.S. Congress,\n\n\n                                  Congressional Budget Office,\n\n                                Washington, DC, November 16, 1995.\n     Hon. Pete V. Domenici,\n     Chairman, Committee on the Budget, U.S. Senate, Washington, \n         DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: The Congressional Budget Office has \n     reviewed the conference report on H.R. 2491, the Balanced \n     Budget Act of 1995, and has projected the deficits that would \n     result if the bill is enacted. These projections use the \n     economic and technical assumptions underlying the budget \n     resolution for fiscal year 1996 (H. Con. Res. 67), assume the \n     level of discretionary spending indicated in the budget \n     resolution, and include changes in outlays and revenues \n     estimated to result from the economic impact of balancing the \n     budget by fiscal year 2002 as estimated by CBO in its April \n     1995 report, An Analysis of the President's Budgetary \n     Proposals for Fiscal Year 1996. On that basis, CBO projects \n     that enactment of the reconciliation legislation recommended \n     by the conferees would produce a small budget surplus in \n     2002. The estimated federal spending, revenues and deficits \n     that would occur if the proposal is enacted are shown in \n     Table 1. The resulting differences from CBO's April 1995 \n     baseline are summarized in Table 2, which includes the \n     adjustments to the baseline assumed by the budget resolution. \n     The estimated savings from changes in direct spending and \n     revenues that would result from enactment of each title of \n     the bill are summarized in Table 3 and described in more \n     detail in an attachment.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  June E.

I yield the floor.\n  Mr. EXON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from \nNebraska.\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, I have listened with great interest to my \nfriend and colleague giving his opening remarks in the debate. I would \nsimply thank him for his kind comments, and I agree that we have worked \ntogether as friends, not always agreeing on all of the issues but at \nleast we will continue in the future to work together, and eventually \nthat relationship might be the basis for some kind of a workable \ncompromise that obviously is going to have to come about, hopefully \nsooner than later.\n  Mr. President, since this budget was unveiled last spring--and we are \njust now looking at the final details of it that were presented to us \nfor the first time last night as numbers were concerned--we happen to \nfeel that the Republicans are asking the American people a question \nthat was once made famous by Groucho Marx. Groucho said, ``Are you \ngoing to believe what you see or what I'm telling you?'' The American \npeople see a budget that is unfair. They see a budget that showers tax \nbreaks for those living on Easy Street but punishes those slogging it \nout on Main Street. They see a budget that bestows bucks to the wealthy \nbut passes the buck to working Americans. They see the Republicans \npledge to their Contract With America but break the promise of Medicare \nmade to American seniors 30 years ago. They see a budget totally out of \ntune with the values of fairness and reasonableness that they hold so \nvery dear.\n  But to this day the Republicans keep trying to spin this budget, \nblurring its hard edges and test marketing its language as if it were a \nnew brand of cereal. But the American people can see through it all. \nThe American people see that the Republicans have gone too far, too \nfast, and the American people are right.\n  I have spent as much time as any Senator arguing for a balanced \nbudget and working for one. It has been an article of faith with this \nSenator. It has been an article of faith with this Senator and many \nothers on this side of the aisle who are in general agreement with many \nSenators on the opposite side of the aisle in this regard.\n  I must say, though, that one of my biggest disappointments has been \nour inability to pass a balanced budget amendment to the Constitution. \nBut there is a way, Mr. President, there is a right way to do it and \nthere is a wrong way to balance the budget. Regardless of where it \noriginates, it must be fair, and it must have shared sacrifice. This \nRepublican budget falls flat in that regard. \n\n[[Page S17230]]\n\n\n  The ugly truth about this extremist Republican budget is that it has \nno semblance of balance. The overwhelming majority of the mandatory \nreductions come from only two areas--the first are the means-tested \nprograms that serve primarily low- and moderate-income Americans. The \nsecond is Medicare, where three-fourths of the beneficiaries have \nincomes under $25,000 a year.\n  Under this budget, ordinary Americans will pay more through higher \npremiums in Medicare, through higher student loan fees, through higher \ncontributions for the GI bill benefits, and through cuts of a major \nmagnitude, through cuts of a major magnitude in the earned-income tax \ncredit. The Republicans keep turning the screws tighter and tighter and \ntighter on the ordinary Americans while opening the spigot of tax \nbreaks for the wealthy.\n  The $270 billion in Medicare reductions are extreme. It is far more, \nfar more than the $89 billion needed to retain solvency of the trust \nfund as recommended by the trustees. Obviously, when the Republicans \nhad to make a choice between doing right for our parents and doing \nright for the rich, they, unfortunately, decided to soak it to our \nseniors to the benefit of the wealthiest of Americans. That is one of \nthe main points that we are most concerned about with regard to this \nbudget rescission that will be vetoed, fortunately, by the President.\n  The same is true with approximately $165 billion in Medicare \nreductions. How many of our most vulnerable neighbors will lose all of \ntheir health insurance? No one knows for sure but estimates have run as \nhigh as 12 million Americans will lose.\n  Rural America's fragile health care system could be shattered through \nthe combined Medicare and Medicaid reductions.\n  Yes, the fix is in for distribution of the tax breaks. If you are \nmaking under $30,000 a year, your taxes are going to go up. The events \nof the past week are an absolute disgrace and do not bode well, \nunfortunately, for the future. The extremists have obviously hijacked \nthe Republican Party, especially in the House, where there is no \nsemblance of reason, fairness, or proportion. The House Republicans \nbared their fangs and they also bared their souls. No wonder the \nAmerican people believe that Republicans have gone too far and way too \nfast. What our Nation needed was a simple extension, just this last \nweek, a simple extension of the continuing resolution and the debt \nlimit, a short-term bridge, one might say. What we got from the House \nwere two bills loaded with so much junk that they looked like a truck \nfrom the Beverly Hillbillies. So what happened? The Government, \nunfortunately, is shutting down and default looms. The Republican \nmajority seemed ready to turn Uncle Sam into a deadbeat dad.\n  What the Republicans did not tell the American public is that their \nvery own budget reconciliation bill will require that the debt ceiling \nbe raised from the present $4.9 to $6.7 trillion by the year 2002. And \none of the biggest reasons for jacking up the national debt by $1.8 \ntrillion is to help pay for the $245 billion break in taxes for the \nwealthy.\n  Every dollar, every dollar for tax breaks, will have to be borrowed \nor found from some other source, and the American people will have to \ncover the ever-increasing cost resulting from it in the form of \ninterest.\n  Since the Republicans clearly need the debt ceiling to be raised to \naccommodate their budget, why, oh, why, then, did we have to go through \nthis charade of the last week? The answer is an old one. Unfortunately, \nit is politics. The Republicans are trying to twist the arm of the \nPresident of the United States into accepting an unacceptable budget, \nwhich the President will not do. They are willing to push this country \nover the edge just to gain better purchase in upcoming negotiations. \nThat is unacceptable also to this Senator. And I believe unacceptable \nto the American people.\n  In spite of all this acrimony over the past month, I still am not \nwithout hope. The essayist C.S. Lewis once said that ``Our friends are \nnot necessarily people who agree with us, they are people asking the \nsame questions.'' I feel that way about many of my friends on the other \nside of the aisle, especially my friend and colleague for so many, many \nyears, the distinguished chairman of the Budget Committee, Senator \nDomenici. For many years we have been asking the same questions about \nhow to balance the budget.\n  Our time on the Budget Committee goes way back to those days when I \nfirst came here, when Senator Muskie of Maine was here and Senator \nHenry Bellmon was the ranking Republican on the Budget Committee. And I \nmust say that I think looking back to those days, we both had great \nrespect for Senator Muskie and for Senator Bellmon. And I think by and \nlarge during our tenure as the leaders of our two parties on the Budget \nCommittee, Senator Domenici and I, with our differences, have had to \ntry and carry on that bipartisan spirit as best we could.\n  For many years then, we, Senator Domenici and I, have been asking the \nsame questions about how to balance the budget. This time we came to \ndifferent answers. But in the weeks ahead we may come to an agreement \nbecause I say to all once again, when all the dust clears, and when all \nthe rhetoric is over, then we are going to have to do the true heavy \nlifting by getting a budget that can pass the House and the Senate and \na budget that will not be vetoed and will be happily signed by the \nPresident of the United States. That is going to be an enormous task \nunder the obvious difficulties that face us. But in the weeks ahead, I \nsuggest we must come to agreement.\n  In closing, Mr. President, we should not view compromise as a \nweakness. I have always viewed it as a sign of leadership and a sign of \nmaturity. And I believe that is the way the American people understand \nit. We know this bill will be vetoed by the President. And in spite of \nthe bullying and in spite of the ultimatums, there is no way the \nPresident will sign it. To this Senator the first compromise is clear, \nand it is compelling. The need is there.\n  We must get together and respond as quickly as we can. Both sides can \ncontinue this trench warfare as long as they want, leaving a scorched \nand desolate landscape. But in the end the heavy lifting, the \ncompromise, mutual understandings are going to have to be reached, and \nI will be a part of that. If we do not do that, Mr. President, we are \ngoing to continue the chaos that we see in America today with the close \ndown of the Government.\n  Mr. President, I will do all that I can, everything in my power, to \nhelp facilitate that process. And I am standing ready once again to do \nwhatever I can to bring a measure of understanding to this body and \nhopefully in the other body to get on with the budget that is not going \nto be perfect, but a budget that could be workable and a budget that I \nfeel can be formulated to balance the income and the outgo of the \nFederal Government in 7 years, as the chairman of the committee has so \noften stated is a necessity.\n\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. GORTON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from \nWashington.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I yield myself such time as I may use.\n  Mr. President, in the eloquent and impassioned remarks by my friend, \nthe Senator from Nebraska, outlining his reasons and those of the \nPresident of the United States for rejecting this historic proposal, \nthe first proposal which offers to balance the budget in almost 30 \nyears, one two-word phrase stood out, and I believe fairly summarizes \nhis position and that of the President of the United States. That \nphrase was--and I quote--``simple extension.''\n  Why would not the Republican Party grant to the President, the \nDemocratic Party, a simple extension of what we have already been \ndoing, a simple extension of the policies of the last 30 years, a \nsimple extension of policies which promise us $200 billion deficits as \nfar as the eye can see, a simple extension of a policy which was \nphrased elegantly in yesterday's Washington Post as ``paying not just \nfor the government we have, but for the government we had and did not \npay for earlier?''\n  The policy of the President, the policy of the minority party in this \nbody is to do just that, not to pay for the Government we have, not to \npay for the Government we want, but to consume all of these societal \ngoods and send the bill to someone else, in this case, to our children \nand to our grandchildren.\n  George Will put it in his column yesterday:\n\n\n[[Page S17231]]\n\n       Having sought in 1992 a mandate for an empty idea--\n     ``change''--he [that is to say, President Clinton] has come \n     to the arguable conclusion that serious change is more \n     trouble than it is worth. Never a martyr to candor, he will \n     not make that argument. [But] still, he does represent a \n     discernible notion of what the Federal Government ought to \n     do--approximately what it is doing.\n\n  And between that idea, simple change, that the Government ought to \ncontinue to do approximately what it is doing, and the ideas presented \nin this budget, there is, Mr. President, a great gulf fixed. We do not \nstand for a simple extension. We do not stand for a Government which \ncontinues to do what it has been doing. We stand for a Government which \nprovides no more in services than it is willing to pay for.\n  The road to that conclusion, seemingly too radical for our \nadministration or our friends on the other side of the aisle, is, \naccording to them, fraught with great difficulty. But, in fact, of \ncourse, Mr. President, it does not mean that we must cut the budget. \nThe budget of the United States will increase by 3 percent in each and \nevery year from now until the budget is balanced. It does not mean that \nwe will cut Medicare. Medicare will grow at almost 8 percent a year--\ninterestingly enough, at a slightly greater rate than it would have \ngrown had we adopted the President's proposals for Medicare that were a \npart of his health care bill just one short year ago. Yet, this course \nof action is denounced as inhuman, as impossible, as literally throwing \nmillions of Americans into poverty, principally, I suspect, because to \nargue its specific content would be to show the shallowness of the \nopposition to this set of ideas.\n  Now, is the proposal which has been laid before us by our wonderfully \ndistinguished friend and colleague, the senior Senator from New Mexico, \nin pursuit of nothing other than some form of ideology that says it is \nnice to have two columns of figures balanced against one another? If \nthat were the case, arguments against it might have some fairly \nconsiderable validity. But that is not the case.\n  It is this business as usual, this simple extension that caused every \nAmerican, no matter what his or her age last year, to pay an average of \nsome $800 in taxes just to cover interest on the national debt; it is \nthis simple extension which causes an American born today to inherit an \naverage debt of some $187,000 during his or her lifetime just to cover \ninterest on our national debt; it is this simple extension, this love \nfor the status quo that, according to the Concord Coalition, headed by \ntwo former Members of this body, one from each party, to report the \ndebt and deficit spending has lowered the income of American families \nby an average of $15,000 per year--$15,000 per year, Mr. President; and \nit is the fact that the proposal that is before us today is believed, \nby a very conservative Congressional Budget Office, to have such a \npositive impact on our economy that the Government of the United States \nitself will be $170 billion better off by the year 2002 than it will be \nif we grant a simple extension.\n  That $170 billion is a small figure compared to the half trillion \ndollars or more by which the American people will be better off because \nof better job and career opportunities, higher incomes, lower interest \nrates on the homes and the automobiles, and the other goods and \nservices that they buy on a time-payment basis.\n  Those are the reasons, Mr. President, that this proposal is before \nyou. Those are the reasons that this proposal represents such a \ndramatic change in course, as the Senator from New Mexico reported \nearlier. In fact, it is perhaps even a greater change in course than he \nexpressed.\n  He reported, as we have frequently, that the last time the budget was \nbalanced was the year 1969. But balancing the budget in 1969 required \nonly modest changes from budget deficits of the previous years. This \ndeficit and this simple extension does require a degree of political \ncourage and a change of course that has not been matched in the memory \nof any Member of either House of the Congress of the United States; not \nmatched by my party in the early 1980's; not matched by the other party \never, as far as we can tell.\n  We are told that this is too much too fast, and the fundamental \nrationale behind that conclusion is that while a balanced budget may be \na good idea in the abstract, not now, not on our watch.\n  Mr. President, I dredge up into my memory some of my reading in \ncollege about St. Augustine, who was reported to have written, and I \nparaphrase, ``Grant me repentance and a new life, O Lord, but not \nnow.'' That, I think, is the view of those on the other side. The \nPresident now, for today at least, holds the belief that maybe we can \nbalance the budget in 10 years, a period of time at least 5 years \nbeyond the end of any term which he could constitutionally hold as \nPresident of the United States.\n  ``Lord, let me repent and grant me a new life, but not now, let \nsomeone else do it at some later time.'' That is the difference between \nthe positions represented by this responsible budget which offers a \ndividend to the American people and their Government of almost a \ntrillion dollars and the course of action advocated by my friend from \nNebraska, and I quote, ``simple extension.'' We are not for a simple \nextension; we are for a new and better course of action.\n  Mrs. BOXER addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?

If you could \nsend down your names and give us some idea when you might be available \nin the next 3 or 4 hours, we very much would like to accommodate you \nbecause we do want people to express themselves. We have a lot of time. \nIf you can do that, bring it down to the manager's desk and we will try \nto work it out to everybody's convenience.\n  I thank the Senator from California.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from \nCalifornia.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Thank you very much, Mr. President. I am glad as a member \nof the Budget Committee that we have finally gotten to this point where \nwe have the reconciliation bill before us, because if ever there was a \ndifference between the two parties, this is the time and the place for \nall America to see it. And those people who say there is no difference \nbetween the parties ought to listen to this debate, because there is a \nhuge difference between the two parties. Both want to balance the \nbudget. The question is, how do you do it? That is the issue. That is \nwhy our President has taken such a firm stand and has not blinked and \nhas not wavered, and has said, in fact, that he could not possibly be \nPresident of the United States if these values of the Republicans--\nthese radical priorities of the Republicans--prevail.\n\n  It is a tough fight. We are all tired. Many of us are very tired. \nThere are a lot of workers today, American workers, who are not getting \npaid because of this fight. Of course, every one of the Senators is \ngetting paid. Essential workers, who are working, are not getting their \npaychecks now. But every Senator is getting a paycheck. This Senate \nvoted twice for the Boxer bill--the no budget-no pay bill. It passed \nunanimously. But Speaker Gingrich is stopping it from coming up in the \nHouse, and now we are having trouble right here in this Chamber. \nSenator Snowe, a Republican Senator from Maine, has a very important \nbill to treat us like every other Federal employee. She is being \nblocked from bringing it up, for whatever reason. Senator Snowe and I \nare going to continue to try to bring it up because it is very \ninteresting that people around here can dish out the pain, but their \nfamilies do not have to worry. I heard one colleague say, ``I cannot do \nthat, I have a mortgage to pay.'' That is right. So does every other \nFederal employee out there. The ones who were told to go home wanted to \nwork. They have kids that they love and they are not getting paid. So, \nyes, this is a very painful fight. It is painful for a lot of people. I \nknow that every single Senator in the U.S. Senate, be he or she \nRepublican or Democrat, has stated in speeches that America is ``the \ngreatest country in the world.''\n  This is the greatest country in the world. Why? Because of the genius \nof the American people, because of the \n\n[[Page S17232]]\nstrength of the people who would lay their lives down for this country, \nbecause of our great democracy, which is the envy of the world. But \nalso because of our Constitution.\n  I am going to read the preamble to the Constitution. When we get \nelected to this office, be we Republicans or Democrats, we raise our \nright hands to uphold this Constitution. I want to read the preamble, \nwhich is the reason for our Government:\n\n       We the People of the United States, in Order to form a more \n     perfect Union, establish Justice, insure domestic \n     Tranquility, provide for the common defence, promote the \n     general Welfare, and secure the Blessings of Liberty to \n     ourselves and our Posterity, do ordain and establish this \n     Constitution for the United States of America.\n\n  That is our guidance. That is what we are supposed to do--provide for \nthe common defense, establish justice, insure domestic tranquility, \npromote the general welfare, and secure the blessings of liberty to \nourselves and our posterity. That is why we are the greatest Nation in \nthe world because, all through the years, in a bipartisan way, we have \nworked to ensure those words.\n  Now, I believe in my heart of hearts--and I do not know whether it is \npopular or whether it is unpopular--that this budget that is before \nus--and I tried as a member of the Budget Committee to make it better, \nalong with my ranking member, Jim Exon, and the other colleagues on \nthat committee--is a radical departure from many years of \nbipartisanship. This budget is a radical departure from bipartisanship. \nIt destroys, in my view, what has made us the greatest country in the \nworld--values. Values, where we say it is, in fact, important to invest \nin our children and their education; that it is important to invest in \nenvironmental protection. Just look at Eastern Europe when they tore \ndown those walls. It was so polluted, they could not have economic \ndevelopment. But, in a bipartisan way, we passed environmental \nlegislation.\n  This budget guts education, guts environmental protection, guts \nprotecting our senior citizens. I have been on this floor and debated \nthis with my colleagues, and the script that they have over on that \nside of the aisle is very clever. ``We are not reducing Medicare, we \nare saving it.'' Well, the senior citizens know better. I ask you, who \ndo you believe? Speaker Gingrich, who said Medicare should ``wither on \nthe vine''? The Republican majority leader, who said, proudly, a month \nago, ``I led the fight against Medicare?''\n  If people in this country believe that the Republican Party, by \ncutting Medicare by $270 billion when the trustees tell us you have to \ncut $89 billion--if the people of the United States believe that is the \nparty that is going to protect Medicare, then I say: Read history--not \nancient history. Go back to the sixties when this program was formed. \nIt was the idea of Harry Truman. It passed during Lyndon Johnson's \ndays.\n  You know what? The last time we had a surplus was when Lyndon Johnson \nwas President. When the Republicans took over from Jimmy Carter in \n1980, I remember when President Reagan turned to Jimmy Carter in a \ndebate and said, ``There you go again.'' He said, ``I am going to \nbalance the budget in 4 years.'' They added more to the debt under the \nyears of Ronald Reagan and George Bush than in all the years from \nGeorge Washington up to Jimmy Carter. They would have you believe that \nthey are the ones who have always been fiscally responsible.\n  Ask them why they increased military spending $30 billion more than \nthe Pentagon asked for. Suddenly, their credentials for cutting budgets \nfly out the window. When it comes to Star Wars, go, go, go--even though \nthe cold war is over. The weapons systems that were drawn up by the \nPentagon so we would be prepared to fight with the Soviet Union are not \ngoing away, they are coming back.\n  Fiscally responsible people. When it comes to gutting Medicare, oh, \nyes, they are fiscally responsible. They gut it. When it comes to \ncutting Medicaid, education, the environment, oh, we are tough. But not \nwhen it comes to the Pentagon.\n  When it comes to raising taxes on the people who make under $30,000, \nthey are tough. We will get more money from those people. That is what \nthey do in this budget. If you earn over $350,000, you get back $5,600 \na year. What is the matter with this picture?\n  David Gergen, a Republican, says this Republican budget is harsh. Why \ndoes he say that? Because 80 percent of the cuts go to the bottom 20 \npercent of Americans and 80 percent of the benefit goes to the top 20 \npercent of Americans.\n  That is the vote we are going to cast here on this reconciliation \nbill.\n  Speaker Gingrich says it was his intuition--I am quoting him--that \nled him to a 7-year balanced budget. The President says if we go to 8 \nyears, 9 years, we can soften the cuts.\n  I hope once this bill is vetoed that there will be some compromise. \nWe were sent here to keep the Government going, to pass a budget. We \nhave to get down to doing just that.\n  Let me give, in closing, because I see other colleagues have come \nover to the floor, in very quick version, the top 10 outrageous aspects \nof this GOP reconciliation conference report.\n  First, the GOP uses about $270 billion cuts in Medicare to pay for a \n$245 billion tax cut for the wealthy. They are taking the Medicare \nfund, they are gutting it, and taking the money and giving it to the \nwealthiest of members. That is probably the top outrage.\n  Second, the GOP increases taxes on working families by $32 billion. \nOutrage No. 2. In other words, a majority of people under $30,000 a \nyear get a tax increase in this budget.\n  Third, the GOP drastically cuts the corporate alternative minimum \ntax. Do you remember the 1980's when we had lists of corporations that \npaid no taxes? We fixed it by writing the alternative minimum tax. Some \nof these corporations actually got refunds--got refunds. We fixed it. \nThis budget reconciliation package takes us back to those bad old days.\n  Next, the GOP permits corporate raids on pension funds. Can you \nimagine, you save for your retirement, and in this bill corporations \ncan go in and essentially take your money. The money that you put away \nevery month, and you look at it, how is it growing, how is it going, \nhow is it doing--they can go in there and take that money. That should \nbe disallowed. So we outlawed that. It is back.\n  While giving tax breaks to the wealthy, the GOP cuts child nutrition.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Thomas). The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mrs. BOXER. I am happy to yield to the Senator.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Does the Senator find it somewhat amazing that on many \nof these issues like billionaires' tax cut, over 90 Members of the \nSenate, Republican and Democrat alike, voted to change that particular \nprovision, and then when it goes over to the closed doors and closets \nof the Republican conference it comes back in?\n  Does the Senator remember when we voted 94-5 not to permit the \ncorporate raiders to rob the pensions? We passed that, Republican and \nDemocrat. It goes over to the conference and it comes right back again. \nWe did that on the discounts for drugs for Medicaid and for public \nhospitals. It went over and came right back again.\n  Double billing--to try and collect for seniors who are on Medicare \nfrom being charged again. Struck out in conference. Our conferees \nretained the current law. We passed it, it goes over there, and it \ncomes back again.\n  Does the Senator reach the conclusion with me that our Republican \nfriends, when it is out in the sunlight they respond to the public \ninterest, and when they are behind the closed doors they have the \nprivate and special interests? That is what we are dealing with.\n  Mrs. BOXER. The Senator is exactly right. When it comes to the \ncorporate raids on pension funds he is right. We voted in a bipartisan \nway to stop that. Guess what happened? In this conference report, \ncorporations would withdraw as much as $20 billion from pension funds--\nup to $20 billion. These provisions were avidly sought by corporate \nlobbyists, but many pension experts warn it could endanger the security \nof the pension funds.\n  In the light of day they all walk the walk and talk the talk but get \nbehind close doors, there it goes. Everything we fought for on this \nside goes out the window.\n  I say to say my friend from Massachusetts who fought hard on this, \nand \n\n[[Page S17233]]\nmy friend from Minnesota, these are issues they brought here.\n  That is why I am reading these 10 outrages because suddenly things we \nfixed are back here again. There are 10 reasons--there are many more \nthan that--but these are the 10 outrages in this reconciliation bill.\n  Here is another one. While giving tax breaks to the wealthiest among \nus, the GOP cuts child nutrition programs, including school lunches, by \n$6 billion. Is it no wonder that this President is taking such a strong \nstand?\n  Next, while giving tax breaks to the wealthy, the GOP cut student \nloan program by $5 billion, including rolling back direct student loan \nprogram to 10 percent of the loan.\n  My friend from Massachusetts has stood up here on his feet hour after \nhour, making the point that the direct loan program means more dollars \nfor the students and cutting out the middle man, if you will. It is \nvery important that we not shut down the direct loan program. They keep \nit going only for 10 percent of the loans. All the hard work my friend \nput into this is out the window.\n  Next, in its Medicaid repeal provision, the GOP eliminates the \nguarantees of nursing home care for seniors who have exhausted their \nassets. Imagine such a thing--imagine such a thing.\n  Of course, there is more on that. We know they have weakened nursing \nhome standards as well.\n  In its Medicaid repeal provision, the GOP eliminates the guarantee of \nhelp with Medicare premiums for low-income seniors.\n  Next, the GOP protects physician fees under Medicare from any actual \nreductions while at the same time doubling seniors Medicare premiums. \nWe saw that happen. Suddenly the AMA says, ``We will back the plan,'' \nbecause they cut a deal at the expense of seniors. Their fees are going \nto be just fine, but Medicare premiums are going to double.\n  How about this: The GOP opens the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to \ndrilling in this bill. Imagine drilling for oil in a wildlife refuge. \nIt is an unbelievable thought. Why is it a refuge if you are going to \nallow drilling in it? It makes no sense. But it is in this bill.\n  I just add, as a California Senator, what else is in this bill? They \nslipped through a provision--follow this one, my friends--that would \nallow for the transfer of 1,100 acres of land to Pete Wilson in \nCalifornia, the Governor of California, who is going to take it for \n$500,000. Mr. President, 1,100 acres of land, what a giveaway, for a \nnuclear waste dump, and it is slipped into this bill. What an outrage \nthat is, and what another reason for this President to veto this.\n\n  While they transfer the land, they say, ``Waive all environmental \nlaws. No environmental laws will apply.'' So imagine, I say to the \nAmerican people who may be watching this, you wake up one day and the \nnext day you have a nuclear waste dump next door to you and all the \nenvironmental laws have been waived on it. You cannot even go to court. \nThat is another outrage, a particular California outrage that is in \nthis bill.\n  So, let me say, if ever people wonder why there is a difference \nbetween the two parties, it is synthesized in this budget. And I pray \nthe President will have the continued strength to take the heat.\n  The Speaker of the House said one of the reasons you got such a tough \ntime here is because the President did not talk to me on Air Force One. \nUnfortunately for the Speaker, there are pictures that show that not \nonly did the President go back there--here is the picture--but he was \nintently listening to Speaker Gingrich. And at another time, the same \nway.\n  This is Speaker Gingrich clearly holding court on Air Force One. He \ncomplains he was treated unfairly. I say to Speaker Gingrich and the \npeople who follow his lead around here, you ought to start thinking of \nthe American people, not the fact that you wanted to spend 3 hours with \nthe President instead of an hour and a half, or you went out of another \ndoor. You are not the President of the United States of America.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Will my colleague yield for a question?\n  Mrs. BOXER. I will be happy to yield to my friend.\n  Mr. LEAHY. If I might, just for 3 minutes, and I have spoken to the \nSenator from Minnesota here who I know wishes to speak, but I would ask \nthis question. When I look at this, I look at this vote as being one of \nthe most significant I will cast in the U.S. Senate. Would my colleague \nnot agree, this is a bill that will punish Vermonters?\n  It will punish the Vermont economy for years to come. It imposes a \nradical agenda on the American people that will squeeze the middle \nclass, hurt the poor, and reward the rich.\n  In my State, I would say, we want a balanced budget. I want a \nbalanced budget. Most Vermonters--Republicans, Democrats, \nIndependents--want a balanced budget. Vermonters want a balanced \nbudget, but they do not want it under an agenda that wipes out most of \nthem. They want an agenda that speaks to all of them.\n  But this balanced budget is Newt Gingrich's agenda. It is not \nVermont's agenda.\n  Would the Senator from California agree with that?\n  Mrs. BOXER. Clearly, it is his agenda. A lot of it is based on \nintuition, is what he told the press.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Will the Senator agree this extreme measure forces working \nVermonters to pay more in taxes, makes it a lot harder for them to send \ntheir children to college, makes it harder for them to have a safe \nnursing home for their parents, and that average Vermonters will be \nmaking these sacrifices, not to balance the budget, but to pay for tax \nbreaks for the rich because it will give the wealthy $245 million in \nnew tax money? Will the Senator from California agree with that?\n  Mrs. BOXER. My friend is so right. He has a small State. I come from \na large State, more than 30 million people. So, I say to my friend, \nimagine, if you took Vermont and put it into California, and you had \nmany Vermonts to make up all of California, that is what this Senator \nis feeling. Because for each Vermonter that gets hurt, many more \nCalifornians get hurt. So I totally agree with my friend.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I would say I ask this question to the \nSenator from California because she represents the largest State in the \nUnion while I represent the second smallest in population. The \ndistinguished Presiding Officer, of course, represents the smallest in \npopulation, although one that in land area encompasses our State many \ntimes over.\n  I would also say, if I might, I have traveled many times in the State \nrepresented by the distinguished Presiding Officer. It is one of the \nmost beautiful places. Were I to live somewhere other than Vermont, it \nwould appeal to me.\n  I raise these questions because we have a 2,000-page bill and, \nwhether you are from a large State or a small State, you have to ask \nwhat it does. The bill will cut Medicare by $271 billion over the next \n7 years; it will cut payment rates to providers and hospitals; it will \nmake seniors pay higher premiums; it will increase deductibles.\n  In Vermont, 73 percent of our elderly population have incomes of less \nthan $15,000. These are things--in a small State like ours, I do not \nknow how we could possibly handle it.\n  Average Vermonters must make these sacrifices not to balance the \nbudget, but to pay for tax breaks for the rich. This bill gives the \nwealthy $245 billion in new tax breaks. The wealthy do not need these \ntax breaks and we cannot afford them.\n  The bill's unnecessary cuts in Medicaid, Medicare, student loans, and \nschool lunches will send the Vermont economy reeling. This is the wrong \nway to balance the budget.\n  At a time when many working Vermonters are struggling to make ends \nmeet, this budget would hike Federal taxes on low- and moderate-income \nworking families by cutting $32 billion from the earned income tax \ncredit--a program the rewards work and compensates for low wages.\n  This Federal tax increase also would raise State taxes in seven \nStates, including Vermont, that have a State earned income tax credit. \nAs a result, 27,000 Vermont working families earning less than $30,000 \na year would be forced to pay higher taxes. This is a double whammy for \nworking families.\n  This budget bill would leave my home State in an economic crisis for \nyears to come.\n  I would say, as I have been saying since June or July on this floor, \nlet us \n\n[[Page S17234]]\ncome together, Democrats and Republicans. Let us forge a bipartisan \nconsensus that will balance the budget but gives educational \nopportunities to our children, allows us to have safe nursing homes for \nparents, gives opportunity for working people.\n  I thank the Senator from California for doing me the courtesy of \nmaking these points. I appreciate it.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I thank the Senator for his questions, and I yield the \nfloor.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I yield such time as the Senator from \nMississippi requires.\n  Mr. LOTT. I thank the distinguished Senator from Washington State.\n  Mr. President, first, I would like to express my sincere appreciation \nfor the great work that has been done on this very important \nlegislation, the Balanced Budget Act of 1995, by the chairman of the \nSenate Budget Committee, the Senator from New Mexico. Senator Domenici \nhas been prepared for this moment by many trials of fire. He has been \nthrough the budget battles for 15 years at least now. They have always \nbeen tough, but none have been as tough or as important as this one. \nThere is no question, without his experience and without his dynamic \nleadership, without Senator Domenici we would not be here today. I want \nthe record to reflect my sincere appreciation for his work, and also \nfor the outstanding work done by Senator Roth, who is the new chairman \nof the Finance Committee. He moved into that chairmanship at a very \ncritical time. He quickly got on top of the issues and has provided \ngenuine leadership in producing a big chunk of what is in this balanced \nbudget bill.\n  Of course, I want to recognize the majority leader. Senator Dole has \nput many, many hours into this effort. As the negotiations on the \nconference report went forward, he was there and met with the conferees \nand subgroups and spent literally hours making this possible. So I \ncommend those three gentlemen for their outstanding work.\n  Many staff people have been involved in it too, and many Members on \nboth sides of the aisle have worked in good faith to try to come up \nwith a genuine balanced budget.\n  Finally, we are getting to what this whole year has been about. \nFinally, after missing the target many times, the Washington Post this \nmorning got it right. The Washington Post reported, ``Clinton \nreiterated his opposition on the grounds that it cuts spending too \ndeeply and commits him to balancing the budget in seven years.'' That \nsums it up. That is what we have been going through here for the last \nfew days--in fact, all year. The President wants spending increases in \nalmost every program, and he does not really want a balanced budget.\n  With this bill he is going to get the balanced budget he doesn't \nwant. He will get an opportunity to sign it and confirm that he in fact \nmeans what he says when he says he is for a balanced budget, for \nchanges in Medicare, for welfare reform and even for tax cuts. He has \nadvocated those, too, on occasion. Or, if he vetoes it, then we will \nhave to wonder, what does he really mean when he says he supports those \ngoals?\n  But, in the end he is going to have to sit down together and talk. We \nare going to have to come together, and we are going to have to come to \nan agreement. The agreement will be that we are going to have a \nbalanced budget in 7 years. I think that, finally, Republicans and \nDemocrats alike now acknowledge that is what we are going to do.\n  The question is: how do we get there? I am sure the priorities will \nbe argued over as we go forward, but we are setting our priorities here \ntoday. We are setting out in this Balanced Budget Act of 1995 what \nneeds to be done. I am very proud that we have stepped up to the task, \nand we are going to achieve it in a responsible, honest and fair \nmanner.\n  This balanced budget is accomplished by controlling the rate of \ngrowth of spending. How many times will we hear from the other side \nthat this program is being cut, that program is being slashed? They \nkeep missing the fact that, in getting the budget under control, what \nwe are really doing is not cutting and slashing programs; what we are \ndoing is controlling the rate of growth.\n  Mr. KERRY. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. LOTT. The American people would be shocked to find out, as a \nmatter of fact, even with this balanced budget, there will still be an \nannual growth of 3 percent in Government spending.\n  Let me say that again. Federal spending will grow at an annual rate \nof 3 percent.\n  So how do you call it a cut when you have a growth, even at a time \nwhen we are moving toward a balanced budget?\n  Let me ask the Senator to let me continue. I waited a long time, and \nI have a meeting I am supposed to attend in just 10 minutes. Let me \ncontinue for a few minutes, and I will be glad to yield, get in a \ndialog with the Senator from Massachusetts, unless he just wants to ask \na unanimous-consent request or something.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I did want to ask the Senator a question, \nbut I appreciate that.\n  Mr. LOTT. Let me continue for a few minutes. We have a time agreement \nand we want to make sure we keep it even. We are a little bit behind \ntime. Let me go ahead, and I will yield in a few minutes, if the \nSenator would not mind. I would be glad to get into a discussion with \nthe Senator from Massachusetts because I know he is interested in this, \nand I know he wants to help find a way to get to a balanced budget.\n  But let me make some points we have not heard yet in speeches that \nhave been given. And I think it is important we get them on the record.\n  This is where you put up or you shut up. My friends, this is it. Now, \nare you for a balanced budget or not? A dozen or more Senators on the \nDemocratic side have voted for a constitutional amendment for a \nbalanced budget. You voted for it. Not all of them this year, but some \nthis year and some in previous years. Maybe they were for it some years \nand not this year. And every Republican has voted for balanced budget \nconstitutional amendments.\n  Also, this very week the former chairman, now the ranking Democrat \nmember of the House Budget Committee, stood up and said he was for a \nbalanced budget in 7 years. Many of our colleagues over here on both \nsides of the aisle have said they are for a balanced budget. Well, when \nand how? What we hear over and over again is, oh, yes, we are for a \nbalanced budget but not here, not there, not somewhere else.\n  My friends on the other side of the aisle, you cannot get there \nunless you are willing to step up to the task of controlling the rate \nof growth of spending or by raising taxes. Oh, and you have \ndemonstrated that you know how to raise taxes. This is where you get a \nchance to vote for real spending control that will get us to a balanced \nbudget.\n  Where is your plan? No, you do not have a plan. All you say is you \ncannot do it here; you cannot do it there. A few of you did try an \nalternative. It got, I think, 19 votes in the Senate--19 votes. In the \nHouse there were a few remaining Democrats that said, hey, we have to \nhave some alternative. Congressman Stenholm from Texas and I think \nmaybe even the former chairman of the Budget Committee over there, \nCongressman Sabo, did have a package that got 80 votes. And they had \nsome good proposals in there. At least they had a proposal.\n\n  Mr. CONRAD. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. LOTT. Just for a brief comment. As I said earlier, if I start \nyielding, I am never going to get to make my remarks. I listened \npatiently while the Senator from California, Senator Boxer, went on at \ngreat length.\n  Let me make my remarks, and then I will be glad to yield.\n  I believe the Senator is one of the Senators who did have a proposal. \nI think it got around 19 votes.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I would just say that we had two \nproposals. One got 39.\n  Mr. LOTT. Thirty-seven.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Thirty-nine out of forty-six Democrats for a balanced \nbudget.\n  Mr. LOTT. Good. I would like to hear you at least say how you would \nget there. And, of course, what they always say is, ``Cut defense, cut \ndefense, cut \n\n[[Page S17235]]\ndefense.'' We have been cutting defense. It is going to take a little \nmore than that. So I think maybe it is important I get to the details \nof how we achieve a balanced budget.\n  It is achieved by controlling the rate of growth throughout the \nGovernment. Every committee in the Senate has had to face up to this \ntask, and it is never easy. Every committee, from the Commerce \nCommittee to the Interior Committee to the Defense Committee, has had \nto come up with its allocated savings, and we have done it. So it is \nthroughout the Government. We will have a decreased rate of growth in \nspending on interior, defense, agriculture--something I do not \nparticularly like, but, yes, agriculture had to ante up, come up to the \ntable and kick in a little bit--energy. Everybody has had to \nparticipate.\n  Now, let me talk about education. So many bits of misinformation are \nbeing put out in that area. Education is not being gutted. In fact, the \nSenate language was accepted in this conference report. That language \nwas accepted with an amendment on a bipartisan vote, as I recall. That \nlanguage prevailed. I wish to emphasize this, too. There will be no \ndirect student impact. Now, some banks will be impacted, maybe some \ninstitutions, but not the students. Who are my friends on the other \nside of the aisle really standing up for? The students will not be \nimpacted.\n  We do control the rate of growth in Medicare. It needs to be done. \nYou cannot have a program that grows 10 percent or more every year over \nthe previous year. I wonder, is maybe a growth each year of 7.7 percent \nenough? I wish to emphasize that. Under the MedicarePlus Program in \nthis bill, Medicare will grow at a rate of 7.7 percent. That is an \nincrease in case ``grow'' is not clear enough. It will go up.\n  It was alleged a while ago that deductibles will go up. That is \ninaccurate. Deductibles are not touched in this package. What we do is \ncontrol the rate of growth.\n  As a matter of fact, the individual per capita Medicare will increase \nfrom $4,800 today to over $7,200 in the year 2002. Now, you can only \ndemagog Medicare and scare elderly people so long. But they understand \nthat there are some improvements that need to be made in the program. \nWe must step up to the needs of Medicare so it will not be insolvent or \neventually bankrupt. We have to make some decisions that will allow \nmore choice in the Medicare Plus Program, and that is what we have done \nin this bill.\n  We have dealt with Medicare's problems; we have preserved it; and in \nfact, we sincerely believe we have improved it.\n  With regard to the MediGrant Program, previously referred to as \nMedicaid, that, too, will grow. As a matter of fact, the MediGrant \nProgram will grow from $90 billion this year to over $127 billion in \nthe year 2002--a 5.2-percent average annual increase.\n  Now, how can you scream and holler that we are cutting the program \nwhen in fact it is going to grow from $90 to $127 billion--5.2-percent \naverage annual increase. And the same is true with programs serving the \nneedy. Those programs will grow over the period of this balanced budget \neffort from $98.2 billion to $132 billion--a 34-percent increase in the \nnext 7 years for programs serving the needy.\n  My friends, we are making tough choices, but we are making sure that \nthe Medicare Program is going to be there and will grow to serve the \npeople like my mother and my family, my children I hope. The same is \ntrue with Medicare and the programs serving the needy.\n  Let me talk about another Medicare issue, something that I am sure is \ngoing to get neglected. I have seen statistics--and I believe it is \ntrue--that as much of the money that we spend for the Medicare Program, \nas much as 10 percent of it may actually be wasted through fraud and \nabuse. We all know there is a problem with that. And there is an effort \nin this exercise to deal with that problem. That is a significant \namount of money that we can save or redistribute to the elderly that \nreally need the help.\n\n  All through the day I am sure the bulk of the debate will be about \nthe balanced budget effort, and it should be, but there will be a lot \nof effort to distort--distort--what we are trying to do with giving \nsome tax relief to the working people of America.\n  It is a novel idea, I know, letting the people who work and earn the \ntaxes keep a little bit of their money. Novel, but it is something that \nI would like to see happen. There are those who say, ``Well, that won't \nbenefit the poor.'' If you are not working and paying taxes, how can \nyou get a little tax relief? That is what we have the needy programs \nfor, for those who are in that category. But I am worried about the \nshipyard worker and the paper mill worker and the farmer, the young \nbusinessman, young entrepreneur who wants to make a little money and \ncreate some jobs; give them a little incentive. But I wish to go down \nthe list and talk about what is really in this bill.\n  First of all, even with the $245 billion tax relief in this package, \nFederal taxes will still increase from $1.4 trillion to $1.9 trillion. \nSo we give a little tax fairness, a little tax relief and yet Federal \ntaxes will still grow dramatically, way too much, in my opinion.\n  I do not guess you talk to the same constituents I do. When I go \nhome, people hammer me and complain about how hard they work and how \nmuch they are paying for taxes. They want a little relief.\n  It is easy to say, ``Oh, yes, we can't have these terrible tax cuts, \nyou know, for the wealthy.'' But let me ask my colleagues on the other \nside of the aisle, which one of these programs it is you are really \nagainst. You indict it en bloc. But look at the specifics in the bill \nand tell me what it is you do not like.\n  Do you not like giving some relief from the marriage penalty? How \nmany of us stood up over the years in the House and the Senate and \nsaid, ``The marriage penalty, how unfair. How can it possibly be?'' You \nget penalized if you get married. Do you want marriage penalized or \nnot? Are you opposed to that? I do not think you will stand up and say \nthat, not a single one of you.\n  How about a spousal IRA? Why should the homemakers working in the \nhome be able to have an IRA like everybody else in America? We are all \nfor that. ``Oh, yes, we're all for that.'' Sure. OK. So, we will accept \nthat.\n  Are you opposed to the adoption credit? Would you not like to give \npeople a little incentive, a little help in adopting children? Oh, \nyeah, you would like that. How about the deduction for custodial care? \nYou probably like that, too. Do you think that individual retirement \naccounts are a good idea as a whole, especially if it is the super-IRA \nthat allows you to use, without tax penalty, your IRA for your first \nhome mortgage, for education, or medical expenses? I will bet you like \nthat. And also, by the way, it is limited to the middle-income people, \nnot to the wealthy.\n  I would like to see everybody entitled to have more IRA's. They \nencourage something we need in America. It is called more savings. We \ngo over to meetings with parliamentarians from other parts of the \nworld, and one of the things we hear about our problems from \neconomists, and everybody else, is Americans do not save enough. It is \nbecause you get penalized in America if you try to save. So we have \nsome additional consideration for individual retirement accounts.\n  We have in this bill a deduction for student loan interest. Anybody \nwant to stand up and oppose the deduction for student loan interest? \nNo. Even the President wants more than that. He wants us to be able to \ndeduct all of the expenses for education. Frankly, I like that idea.\n  But as you go down this list, and this tax cut, what we are talking \nabout is putting some fairness back in the code, getting rid of some of \nthese things, like the marriage penalty, and creating some incentives \nto encourage savings.\n  And the capital gains rate. If we cut the capital gains tax rate--and \nwe are going to do it in this bill--it will have a tremendous impact on \ngrowth in the economy. So many of us now get so deep into argument over \nspending and the balanced budget that we forget to talk about, how do \nwe get some continued growth in the economy? How do we create jobs? It \nis great to talk about welfare reform with work required at the end, \nbut what can we do to help ensure that there are jobs being created? \n\n[[Page S17236]]\n The capital gains rate cut is a little relief by cutting that capital \ngains rate down to 18.9 percent.\n  The President says he is for that. And that is not hearsay. He has \ntold this Senator, personally, ``Yes. I like the capital gains tax \ncut.'' And I believe he still thinks that. Maybe we will not know for \nsure until later. But if you want to complain about a capital gains \nrate cut that might go to some people that are making use of it, \nincluding people that just maybe want to sell their home and are \nentitled to a little break there, I do not believe you want to really \nstand up and oppose that.\n\n  We provide some relief in estate taxes. I have never understood how \nwe got into the process of taxing death. Why should a couple that works \nall their lives when they die have their estate taken away because of \nridiculous, excessive, in my opinion, estate taxes that should not \nexist at all? We provide a little estate tax relief for family-owned \nbusinesses and farms.\n  So if you go through this whole tax cut package, we have a special \nlow-income housing tax credit that is included in this package. Medical \nsavings accounts--I think this is a great idea. Give people some \nincentive, a little encouragement, to have a medical savings account on \ntheir own.\n  This is a good package. And it is going to provide more fairness to \nthe Tax Code and going to create growth in the economy. It is an \nimportant component of this whole package. I really do frankly think \nthat the growth estimates that we are dealing with are low. I think we \nare going to have more growth.\n  I think the package is going to contribute to an explosion of \nactivity in the economy. I think there is going to be more growth than \nwe are now projecting. But I do not want to spend it before we get it. \nLet us see what happens. If we get down the road a couple years and \neverything is doing great, because we had the courage to pass a real \ntax incentive package, then we can have maybe another unusual idea--let \nthe people who pay the taxes get a little bit more of their money back.\n  So my colleagues, I think a good job has been done here. I think it \nis time to quit whining and growling and pointing fingers. We have been \nthrough all of that.\n  This is a good and balanced package. Let us get it through. Let us go \nahead and pass it as we are going to do tonight, and I hope with some \nDemocrat support. I think maybe we will. And let us see what we can do \nto get it signed into law and have, for the first time in my 23 years \nin Congress, a balanced budget proposal that will actually get us to a \nbalanced budget in a reasonable period of time, 7 years.\n  Mr. President, I would be glad to yield to the Senator from \nMassachusetts at this point. I would like to ask, at the suggestion of \nthe floor leader, at this time that it count against the other side's \ntime so we can keep a balance. Under these rules, we only have 5 hours \neach. So, would the Senator from Nebraska yield a little time to the \nSenator from Massachusetts, if he would like to ask questions?\n  Mr. EXON. I would not object to yielding. I would simply say that \nthis is a very difficult position that I am in. We have plenty of time, \nbut we have an awful lot of Senators wanting to make a speech that I \nthink is very, very important. Therefore, I do not believe I would be \ninterested in yielding any significant amount of time because there \nhave been several Senators that I have stacked up waiting now.\n  How much time would it take to ask the question of the Senator from \nMassachusetts?\n  Mr. KERRY. One minute.\n  Mr. EXON. I am pleased to yield 1 minute.\n  Mr. LOTT. I will be glad to respond.\n  Mr. KERRY. I simply would like to ask my colleague, how he can \npersist in the myth that there is not a cut, when you unilaterally take \na certain amount of money that is available for a fixed set of benefits \nand you cut that amount of money, even if it still is only a reduction \nin the rate of growth? How is it not a cut, if the growth in the \npopulation of people expecting those benefits continues at a rate that \nexceeds what is provided in your budget? How is that not a cut?\n  Mr. LOTT. The Senator said it himself, ``even in those areas of \ngrowth.'' It goes from $4,800 to $7,200 over the 7 years. In the \nMedicare-Plus program that is a growth any way you slice it. But also \nwe are not just dealing with numbers. We are also making programmatic \nchanges.\n  We are trying to give incentives for people to find ways to maybe get \nMedicare at less cost. That is the idea behind the medical savings \naccount. And that is the idea behind encouraging people to take \nadvantage of whatever it is, the physicians services organizations, \nHMO's. A whole variety of new ideas can be pursued through this \nlegislation. And also we believe we can just--and in a bipartisan way--\nhave a process to get at the fraud and abuse. That is 10 percent of the \ncost of this program that we can then use to help the people that need \nthe help in the Medicare area.\n  Mr. KERRY. I wish we had time to pursue it. I do not now, but I will \nwhen I speak.\n  Mr. LOTT. I yield the floor, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, I would like to get some order now if we \ncould. We have plenty of time, but we are having difficulty meeting the \nschedules of the individual Senators. At 3:15 we had this list in their \norder of appearance on the floor: Senator Wellstone, Senator Bob \nKerrey, Senator Kennedy, Senator Dorgan, Senator Conrad, Senator John \nKerry and Senator Pryor.\n  Senator Wellstone will be first. He has indicated to me that he would \nlike 10 minutes. May I inquire of the other Senators about how much \ntime they would take when I yield, so the other Senators would have \nsome idea of time.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Fifteen minutes.\n  Mr. EXON. Fifteen. All right.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I would like 15 as well.\n  Mr. EXON. Fifteen.\n  Senator Dorgan, 15?\n  Mr. DORGAN. Yes.\n  Mr. EXON. Does Senator Conrad ask for 15?\n  Mr. CONRAD. Yes.\n  Mr. EXON. Senator John Kerry, 15?\n  Mr. KERRY. Yes.\n  Mr. EXON. Senator Pryor?\n  Mr. PRYOR. Fifteen.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Can I say to the Senator from Nebraska, I will try to \ndo 10. If I go a little over--why not put 15? Put 15 and I will try to \ndo 10.\n  Mr. EXON. You bid first. I ask unanimous consent at this particular \ntime, upon recognition from the Chair, that the following Senators be \nrecognized in this order charged to our time: Senator Wellstone, 10 \nminutes; the following Senators 15 minutes each: Senator Bob Kerrey, \nSenator Kennedy, Senator Dorgan, Senator John Kerry and Senator Pryor.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, true, I was here waiting for a long \ntime. I would like 15.\n  Mr. EXON. I correct the Record. The only change is the Senator from \nMinnesota gets 15 minutes instead of 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I thank the Chair. Mr. President, as I listened to my \ncolleague from Mississippi--and I am really sorry he is not here, and \nthe reason he is not here, he has other work to do. We speak and we \nleave. He is not here because he is unwilling to be engaged in debate. \nHe certainly is.\n  In many ways, I think this debate goes way beyond the whole question \nof a balanced budget, since I think all Senators believe we ought to \npay the interest off on our debt. But I am reminded of David Stockman's \nbook in the early 1980's, and I think this Gingrich agenda is not \nreally about balancing the budget. I think it is about overturning 60 \nyears of people's history, because if it was about balancing the \nbudget, there would be some standard of fairness.\n  If it was about balancing the budget, you would have military \ncontractors that would be asked to sacrifice and would be asked to \ntighten their belt.\n  If it was about balancing the budget, you would not have all of these \ntax giveaways which disproportionately flow to those people at the top \nof the income ladder.\n  If this was about balancing the budget, we would have everything on \nthe table and all of those tax loopholes and tax breaks and tax \ngiveaways that the Pulitzer prize-winning journalists \n\n[[Page S17237]]\nBartlett and Steele talk about in their book ``America: Who Really Pays \nTheir Taxes,'' all of that would be on the table.\n  I do not even think this is about balancing the budget, because if it \nwas about balancing the budget, we would be looking at all of those \nareas, and we would be asking all of the citizens of our country to be \nwilling to be a part of the sacrifice, because they are more than \nwilling to do so.\n\n  This is not about balancing the budget. This is about overturning 60 \nyears of people's history, and there is going to be one heck of a \ndebate on the floor of the Senate, but most important of all, there is \ngoing to be a huge debate in this country, and let me give but a few \nexamples.\n  Mr. President, in 1965, we passed the Medicare and the Medical \nAssistance Program. There was a reason we passed those programs. They \ndid not represent Heaven on Earth, but they made life a lot better for \npeople who were elderly and also low-income people. There are \nimperfections. We can do better.\n  But I want to just say to my colleagues that this Gingrich agenda--I \nhave called it very reckless with the lives of the people in our \ncountry--let me just tell you that it will have a very serious and a \nvery negative impact on the lives of Minnesotans.\n  I said it before when I was debating Haley Barbour the other day on a \nshow, he was talking about this agenda--and I will not put words into \nhis mouth, he is not here to debate me; that is not fair--but I kept \ncoming back to him and saying, ``You don't know my State: In my State, \nwe have already kept the costs down and now you are penalizing us for \nkeeping costs down?''\n  I said, ``You don't know my State: In greater Minnesota, in rural \nMinnesota, many of our caregivers, our hospitals, our doctors, our \nclinics have a patient payment mix where it is 60, 70 percent \nMedicare.''\n  ``You don't know my State.'' I went on to say, ``You don't know my \nState: Seventy thousand senior citizens in Minnesota are poor. Stop \ntalking about the elderly as if they are affluent.''\n  ``You don't know my State: The median income for elderly people is \n$17,000 a year and, on the average, every year they pay $2,500 out of \npocket.''\n  ``You don't know my State: Many of them can't afford prescription \ndrug costs.''\n  ``You don't know my State: My mother and father are no longer alive. \nThey both had Parkinson's disease. Without Medicare coverage--they \nnever had any money--they would have gone under.''\n  I just feel as if the people who designed this agenda do not know my \nState. I think they have moved way beyond the goodness of people in \nAmerica. It is too extreme and it is too harsh.\n  ``You don't know my State: 300,000 children are covered by medical \nassistance. We have done a great job in Minnesota using that program as \na safety net for children.''\n\n  ``You don't know my State: Many families are able to keep a severely \ndisabled child at home because of medical assistance and now they worry \nthat they may not be able to do that.''\n  ``You don't know my State: Two-thirds of the people in the nursing \nhomes receive medical assistance, and we are trying to figure out who \nmakes up that gap.''\n  Mr. President, I heard my colleague from Mississippi say it is about \nvalues. He is right, it is about values. And I will tell you something \nright now. I am confident that Minnesotans believe it is far more \nimportant to invest in health care and the health and intellect and \ncharacter of young people--education--and also to provide children with \na chance than it is to give away all these tax breaks to large \ncorporations, to have these tax giveaways, $245 billion mainly going to \npeople on the top, to have a Pentagon budget that is over what the \nPentagon asked. You better believe it is all about choices. That is \nexactly what it is about.\n  But this Gingrich agenda is not an agenda to balance the budget. It \nis an agenda to move our country not into the 21st century but back \ninto the 19th century.\n  Mr. President, we did not get it right in the last 60 years, but we \nmade gains for people. We developed a safety net. It did not mean that \nevery child had it so good. But at least we made it better for \nchildren. We had a safety net that at least gave us some assurance that \nchildren would not be so impoverished that they, in fact, would go \nhungry.\n  I argue, if we are going to talk about values that I believe as a \nSenator from Minnesota, I believe as the son of a Jewish immigrant from \nRussia, I believe as a former college teacher, I believe as a father, \nand I believe as a grandfather that every infant, regardless of gender \nand regardless of race and regardless of income and regardless of rural \nor urban, should have the same chance to fully develop his potential or \nher potential.\n  Now we have a safety net program for low-income children slashed by \n$82 billion, $17 billion more than the Senate ``welfare reform'' bill. \nNow we have the School Lunch Program cut by $6 billion.\n  We have had two studies, one of them by Health and Human Services and \none of them by the Office of Management and Budget, and those studies \ntold us something we did not want to know, or at least some of my \ncolleagues do not want to know, which is that these cuts in these \nprograms will mean that there will be more impoverished children in \nAmerica and more children will go hungry in America.\n\n  This is all about values, that is for certain, but it is not about \nbalancing the budget.\n  I brought to the floor of the Senate an amendment, and it says we \ncould cut $70 billion by just having some tax fairness. We have a Tax \nCode for regular people; we have a Tax Code for privileged people. I \nlooked at a number of different areas. I looked at the minimum tax, \nretaining the minimum tax for large multinational corporations in this \nbudget bill; that is no longer there. I looked at subsidies for oil \ncompanies and coal companies. I looked at subsidies for pharmaceutical \ncompanies, and the list could go on and on.\n  Mr. President, what my colleagues do not tell you about are these tax \ngiveaways, all the cuts in capital gains tax, all the cuts in rapid \ndepreciation allowances, you name it. People in this country do not \nbelieve that we ought to at this time of tight budgets, at this time of \ndeficit reduction be doing this in such a way that we ask the citizens \nto tighten their belts who cannot tighten their belts; that we target \nthe elderly, we target people with disabilities, we target children, \nfor God's sake, we target working families, families with incomes under \n$27,000 a year. But, at the same time, we have tax giveaways for the \nwealthy. We do not take on any of the corporate welfare. We let all \nthese large companies continue with all of their tax loopholes and all \nof their tax breaks, and the military contractors have it just fine.\n\n  Mr. President, this is not about balancing the budget. This is an \neffort on the part of my colleagues to essentially say that they do not \nbelieve in a country where we focus so much on education, and equality \nof opportunity, and adequate health care for people, health care that \nis delivered in a humane and dignified way; they do not think the \npublic sector should be involved in this area. As a matter of fact, \nthey think when it comes to some of the most pressing problems of \npeople's lives, there is nothing the Government can or should do.\n  That is a great philosophy if you own your own large corporation. But \nif you do not, if you are in the majority in this country, what we are \ntalking about right here is an assault on what is the dearest principle \nof this country, which is equality of opportunity.\n  Mr. President, this is not a debate about balancing the budget. This \nis a debate about what this country stands for. This is a debate about \nthe very values people hold dear.\n  I will tell you right now, Mr. President, people in this country do \nnot believe in the harshness of this Gingrich budget. They believe it \nis mean-spirited, they believe it is extreme, they believe it goes too \nfar. And the more people come to understand what is in this budget \nproposal, the less they are going to like it.\n  As a Senator from Minnesota, I am very proud to speak on the floor of \nthe Senate on behalf of what I consider to be the vast majority of \npeople in my State. I am proud to speak against this budget proposal. I \ndo not believe that this proposal is good for this Nation. I do not \nbelieve that this proposal brings this Nation forward. I think it turns \n\n\n[[Page S17238]]\nthe clock backward. I think most people in the country believe that.\n  I think the President, without a doubt, will veto this, and we will \nhave a debate again, based upon substantive work, based upon what I \nhope will be a set of proposals that will make this Nation all that \nthis Nation can be.\n  This budget ought not to be accepted. This budget should not pass. It \nwill. This budget will be vetoed by the President. He should do so. As \nfar as I am concerned, we can have a debate about the values. We can \nhave a debate about choices, and we can have a debate about priorities \nfor America, and we can take it right to the 1996 election.\n\n  I will be proud to say to Minnesotans that I am the children's \nSenator and that I fight hard for senior citizens. I will be proud to \nsay to Minnesotans that I am a health care Senator. I will be proud to \nsay to Minnesotans that I am an education Senator. I will be proud to \nsay to Minnesotans that I think some of the heavy hitters and large \nspecial interests ought to also be asked to tighten their belts. I will \nbe proud to say to Minnesotans that my vote, my debate, my words, and \nwhat I do as a U.S. Senator is based upon a Minnesota sense of \nfairness. That is lacking in this budget. It should be defeated.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan is recognized.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I yield myself such time as I may need. I \nwill be very brief.\n  Mr. President, I guess two people can look at the same bill and see \ndifferent things. I have a hard time looking at our Balanced Budget Act \nof 1995 and seeing the kind of recklessness in values and concerns the \nSenator has just spoken of. I see a whole different picture in front of \nAmerica if we do not pass this act.\n  What I see as reckless is spending the country into the debt we are \nheaded toward, in which children, in their lifetime, will pay $187,000 \njust in interest on the Federal debt that will grow during their \nlifetime if we do not bring this under control. That is the kind of \nunfairness to children in America we are here to end today. When we are \ntalking about values, I can think of no values more important than the \nlong-sustaining values of this country, and that we pass on to the next \ngeneration more than we inherited, not less. Yet, that is the direction \nin which we would head if we do not balance the budget and pass this \nact today.\n  To expand more on that, I now yield 15 minutes to the Senator from \nMissouri, Senator Ashcroft.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri is recognized.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Michigan for \nyielding time to me.\n  It is true that different people can look at the same thing and see \ndifferent things. As the Senator from Michigan has aptly stated, some \nlook at this package and view spending $4,800 in 1996 per recipient to \n$7,000 in 2002 per recipient as a cut. I think you have to be a very \nsubstantial pessimist to call an increase of $2,200 over a base of \n$4,800 a cut--but that is how some people are choosing to view it.\n  I personally do not think it is nor do I see it as a cut. I see it as \nan increase. It is this precise inability to come to the same \nconclusion from viewing the same set of facts that sometimes confuses \nus. However, sometimes--as a single individual--you can look at the \nsame thing--time and time again--and see something different all the \ntime.\n  For instance, you can look at the President of the United States and \ntry and find out whether he wants a balanced budget at all, or whether \nhe wants a balanced budget in 7 years, or whether he wants a balanced \nbudget in 10 years. You could look at the President of the United \nStates and try and find out whether he wants to use the figures of the \nOffice of Management and Budget, which is the political arm of the \nPresidency, or whether he wants to balance the budget according to the \nnonpartisan Congressional Budget Office.\n  Depending on when you look at our President, you get a different \nreading. You and I know that he said, when he was a candidate, that he \nwanted a balanced budget in 5 years. Later on, he came to us with a \nbudget that would never balance. Then he came with one that would \nbalance in 10 years, but only if you use the partisan figures of his \nOffice of Management and Budget. In between times, he said 7 to 9 \nyears.\n  So looking even at the same President, you might see far different \nthings. It is, in part, because the President has not been firm. He has \nnot reflected the kind of dedication and commitment to a balanced \nbudget that indicates that he has a plan for one. As a matter of fact, \nthe President has not had a budget at all. Well, he did send a budget \nup here, and it was so unrealistic that it lost 0-99. His second \nbudget, the so-called balanced budget, was voted down 0-96. Not a \nsingle Member of the minority party voted in favor of either budget.\n  As we have been trying to find ways for the President to maintain the \noperation of Government in the last several days, we have seen the same \nPresident, but we have seen something vastly different every time we \nhave seen him. At first, he says it is the Medicare problem. He cannot \nbear to have spending increased only from $4,800 to $7,000 per Medicare \nrecipient per year over the next 5 or 6 or 7 years. That is not a big \nenough increase.\n  The truth of the matter is that the provision we are going to send \nhim in the Balanced Budget Act of 1995 has bigger increases in Medicare \nthan he originally requested. He asked for 7.1 percent, I think, and we \nare sending a budget that has a 7.7 percent. He threatened to veto our \nproposals due to both his effectiveness and willingness to scare people \nover Medicare.\n  Medicare also was his main concern when trying to pass the continuing \nresolution. Therefore, we decided to send him a continuing resolution \nwithout a Medicare provision. When we ripped off the Medicare mask, \nwhat did we see? We saw a President concerned about regulatory reform. \nHe said ``I would not want to sign something that has regulatory reform \nassociated with it.'' I said to myself, is this the same President \nthat, in the past, has said, ``We want and need regulatory reform, and \nwe need to free this economy, and we need to unshackle the economy so \nwe can have more jobs, growth and opportunity''? Apparently, not at the \nmoment, because he said, ``If you have regulatory reform or the \ncriminal justice system reform in the package***'' --oh, about 20 years \nago, the President and I had the privilege of each being an attorney \ngeneral. We all know the way in which the criminal element manipulates \nthe criminal appeals, and how the habeas corpus laws are abused. We saw \nthem operate as attorneys general. We saw them operate as Governors. We \nsee them operate now.\n  I believe he really knows that we need to reform the criminal appeals \nprocess, but he said he did not want to sign a continuing resolution \ncontaining criminal appeals reform. So we took the criminal appeals and \nregulatory reform out. We even took the provisions strengthening, \nprotecting and preserving Medicare out of the continuing resolution and \nsent it to the President. It became clear, after ripping off all the \nmasks--the Medicare, the regulatory reform and the habeas corpus reform \nmasks--the real reason for his veto. His real reason for vetoing the \ncontinuing resolution can rest only on the single condition that now \nattends the continuing resolution, and that is the condition of a \nbalanced budget in 7 years, with honest CBO figures.\n  A balanced budget is important. It is important that we understand \nthat a balanced budget is not a sacrifice for this country--it is a \nsubstantial investment in this country.\n  We talk about cuts and we use the phony language of Washington to \nmake it a cut. When you have an increase from $4,800 per year per \ncapita to over $7,000 per year per capita, only in Washington, DC, does \na $2,200 increase on a $4,800 base per capita result in the ability of \nsome individuals to call it a cut.\n  Not only do we not cut spending, we make substantial improvements and \ngive substantial opportunities to the American people.\n  The benefits have been quantified. The econometric studies have been \nconducted. The ideas have been distilled. The forecasts have been made. \nHere is the forecast: Nearly $11 billion more to our gross domestic \nproduct will result from a balanced budget. \n\n[[Page S17239]]\n That is real growth. That is real increase. An additional $32 billion \nin real disposable income to American families will be realized in the \ntime period covered.\n  More than 100,000 additional new houses will be built over the next 7 \nyears. More than 600,000 new cars will be sold in America over the next \n7 years as a result of the discipline, as a result of the priority \nsetting, as a result of this country doing what every family has to do \non a regular basis. That is--sit around and say what can we afford, \nwhat can we not afford, how can we structure what we are doing--how can \nwe achieve prosperity rather than continuing our decline.\n  That prosperity is important and it will make a big difference to \npeople who are buying houses. They say $10,000 less for payments for \npeople on a $100,000 home loan--a $10,000 bonus for a family in \naddition to the tax relief for families in the bill. You consider other \nareas where the family is borrowing money, such as car loans and \nstudent loans. The impact on our culture is not an impact of shared \nsacrifice. This is an impact of enjoyed benefit.\n  We balance the budget. Not only are there more jobs, 100,000 new \nhouses, 600,000 more new cars in the country in the next 7 years, but \nalso we have this vitality in the economy that gives us all great \nopportunity.\n  Our President, though, is unwilling to make a commitment to join us, \nto join us in the necessary discipline to balance the budget.\n  I am afraid we have found ourselves backed into a political corner. \nHe is saying he cannot do it because of Medicare. He is saying he \nwanted to increase Medicare by 7.1 percent, and this bill increases \nMedicare by 7.7 percent. This proposal significantly exceeds his own \nproposal. Yet he holds up Medicare as an attempt to scare the American \npeople.\n  Not only do we spend substantially more for Medicare but we are going \nto provide ways for people to use what we spend to be much more \neffective. All the marketing, all the revolution in the health care \nprofessions to restrain costs and to expand service and to improve the \nproduct available to the American people and the private sector really \nhas not been available in the public sector. That is why the public \nsector's costs have soared.\n  Well, in the private sector for medical costs we have seen a leveling \noff of those costs, the HMO's, the PPO's, the ability of physicians to \njoin together in order to offer services. All of those things are part \nof the program in addition to moving people from $4,800 a year to over \n$7,000 a year. That is not just a gross number but a per capita number, \ntaking into account the demographic projections that seem to frighten \nour colleagues on the other side of the aisle so dramatically.\n  It is time for us to understand this is a great opportunity. We have \ncome to a crossroads in American history. We are at a turning point. It \nis a turning point that we need to recognize and understand.\n  It is whether or not we will conduct business as usual, whether we \nare just going to go merrily down the beaten path of massaging the old \nhot button of acquiescence in the demands of this or that special \ninterest group, and continue to run the printing press which publishes \nthe debt of the United States. It is whether we are going to generate \nat higher and higher volumes to the detriment of our children, or \nwhether we will make some important decisions about allocating our \nresources.\n  There are tough decisions, but they are not impossible by any stretch \nof the imagination. There are a few areas where there are real cuts, \nbut frankly there are many more areas where we just restrain the \ngrowth. We bring Government under control.\n  This is a question about Government control, whether we will control \nGovernment or whether Government--out of control--now will spend so \nmuch of the next generation's money that it will control everything \nthat they do.\n  If kids who are born this year are going to have to spend $187,000 \njust to cover the interest costs on the national debt during their \nlifetimes, their spending will be controlled. They will not have the \nopportunity to decide to do other things. They will have an obligation \nwhich will simply lock them into paying for the excesses of our \nconsumption. We can turn that around, and we can turn it around now. We \nhave not done so since 1969. We have not had the encouragement. We have \nnot had the integrity. We have not had the tenacity.\n  In 1994, last fall about this time, the American people said \n``stiffen your spine. Resolve to make a difference. Do something \ndifferent. Change the way.'' That is why we are at a turning point. \nThis is about control. We want the future generations to be able to \ncontrol their own environment and their own communities. We want the \nfuture generations to have the control to spend their money on their \nown priorities, not to have to just pay off the debt which we have been \npaying.\n  We must act now if we want to stop this potential of eroding the \nability of the next generation, undermining the ability of your \nchildren and mine. Hopefully someday I will have grandchildren--and I \ndo not want to shift to them the responsibility to pay for the things \nthat I have done. I want them to have the opportunity to do what every \nAmerican should have the opportunity to do--that is to exercise the \nfreedom of shaping a Government and spending your own resources the way \nyou choose. It is as fundamental as the beginning of the American \nRepublic.\n  Mr. President, 200 years ago Thomas Payne said it best, I think: ``We \nhave it within our power to make the world over again.'' That is \nbasically a statement that free people can govern themselves and they \ncan devote their resources to things that they choose to devote their \nresources to.\n  We keep spending in debt--further and further in debt--stacking it up \nto where it is now about $19,000 per person, every man, woman and \nchild. Mr. President, it is $76,000 for a family of four, and we are \nnot paying off the debt, we are just paying interest on it.\n  Now if we keep stacking up that kind of debt we simply will not allow \nthe next generation to make any choices on their own. They are just \ngoing to have to spend all they have to pay foreign creditors, pay all \nkinds of other individuals.\n  Talk about big business. They talk about we sure do not want to do \nanything that would help business. We want the little guy to prosper. \nWho do you think holds this debt? The people that own the securities of \nthe United States--a lot is held in the hands of foreign people and \ngovernments.\n  Do you want the people who command what your children and \ngrandchildren do to be people overseas--people who have the ability to \ncall the debt and demand that the payments be made. Then the only thing \nthat those who follow us have the opportunity to decide will be to \ndecide to pay the guys who hold the debt? We owe them much more than \nthat. We owe them much more than that.\n  Our country came into existence as a result of taxation without \nrepresentation. I am afraid unless we stand up for the children right \nnow and say we are now going to continue spending their money without \ntheir representation, we are not going to continue spending their \nresources and displacing to them the costs of doing our business--they \nwould have every right to revolt against us--just as we did to \nestablish this country in the first instance.\n  It is time for accountability. The American people want a Government \nwhich pays its debts. They sense that we can do it. When the different \nmasks were being displayed by the President--about we cannot do this \nbecause it is the Medicare thing, there was a lot of confusion. Then \nthe Medicare mask was taken off and we sent a continuing resolution \nwithout the Medicare provision and another mask was pulled out. Finally \nall the masks are gone.\n  The only thing that is left is the balanced budget. We come down to \nthe question, Mr. President--I ask for an additional minute.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. I yield 1 minute to the Senator.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. So, now the President has before him an ability to \ncontinue the operation of the Government, coupled with a golden \nopportunity to commit this Government to responsibility and integrity. \nHe can do that in signing a continuing resolution and he can do that in \nembracing a historic achievement for his administration or any other, \nthe Balanced Budget Act of 1995. \n\n[[Page S17240]]\n\n  This is a golden opportunity. It is not an opportunity that will make \nthat much difference to you and me, but it will make a great difference \nto the generations that follow.\n  It is time for us to share with them the benefits of an ordered, \npriority-setting development of a budget that is structured and \nresponsible and respects our future.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Cochran). Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Nebraska, under an earlier order, is recognized for \n15 minutes.\n  Mr. KERREY. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, this reconciliation bill conference report is going to \npass. It is going to be sent to the President and he is going to veto \nit. The question will be, in the aftermath, can Republicans and \nDemocrats get together, can we pass something that is veto proof? I \nhope in fact we can.\n  I must say at the beginning, I praise the Republican leadership for \nattacking this problem. It is very difficult, almost always guaranteed \nto produce a considerable amount of controversy. It is rarely popular \nwhen you take something away from somebody who has an expectation they \nare going to get it and you always set yourself up for exaggerated \nclaims, regardless of whether they are coming from this side of the \naisle or coming from out in the community. I have done it as Governor. \nI voted for it as a Senator in 1990 and 1993. It always happens. It is \nvery seldom the sort of thing that gets you a round of applause, when \nyou do what I consider to be a very important and responsible thing.\n  So I begin my analysis of this conference report by thanking the \nRepublican leadership for tackling this problem. I believe we do need \nto balance our budget. I do not in fact buy into the argument that our \ndebt is rising at an unacceptable level. As a percent of GDP, it is \nactually going down. Relative to where we were after World War II, it \nlooks fairly good. As a matter of fact, if you look at the markets and \nwhat the market is doing right now, it seems to me we ought to be \ncareful as we examine this argument about whether or not our debt is \nwhere it ought to be or should it be higher or should it be lower. It \nseems to me it is heading in the right direction.\n  Nonetheless, it is important, in my judgment, for the Federal \nGovernment to have its budget in balance. So, again, I praise the \nRepublican leadership for setting before this body a proposal that will \naccomplish that. I hope, after this proposal is vetoed, that some of \nthe comments I have made might give Republican leadership some ideas of \nwhere I, at least, as one Democrat, want to see some change.\n  To begin with, I do think it has to be fair. It has to pass some test \nof fairness. This proposal left no impact upon me. It will have \nabsolutely no impact upon me. Before I got here, and after I leave, and \nright now, my income is high enough it does not have any impact upon \nme. I do not receive a great deal of Government services, and as a \nconsequence I can stand here courageously and say, ``Go ahead and do \nthe deal.'' I have some stocks and bonds, so maybe I will have a gain \non the capital gains tax reduction. It seems to me some standard of \nfairness needs to be applied.\n\n  Second, one of the things I think we urgently need to do as a body is \nanswer the question, what kind of safety net does the Federal \nGovernment need to provide? If we want to have a market economy, and I \nthink most of us understand we need to have a market economy in order \nto create jobs, and I think most of us support the idea of creating tax \nand regulatory environments so that people will want to make \ninvestments so our economy will grow, we need a safety net of some \nkind. All of us understand that. That is one of the most encouraging \nthings in this debate, is Republicans saying they want to preserve and \nprotect Medicare. Medicare is a safety net provided for people over the \nage of 65. When they leave the work force they have been and are able \nto purchase health insurance. It has worked. Nobody over the age of 65 \nis uninsured. Mr. President, 100 percent of the people over the age of \n65 are insured.\n  The problem is, the economy has changed substantially since 1965 and \nall you have to do is pick up the newspaper and read about record \nmergers and read about companies laying folks off, or go home and talk \nto somebody who is 50 years of age, man or woman, who has worked in a \ncompany for 30 years, who finds himself or herself unable to purchase \nhealth care, finds himself or herself struggling with retirement \nquestions, struggling with how do I retrain myself.\n  We have a radically different economy, and if we want a market \neconomy, it seems to me, the question we ought to be wrestling with is \nwhat kind of safety net should be built? This proposal, as I see it, \nmoves us away from a safety net, particularly as regards to health \ncare. And particularly, especially the block granting of Medicaid back \nto the States, as I see it, will erode and move us away from that kind \nof--at least that kind--of a safety net.\n  I have a number of objections to this proposal that cause me to have \nto vote no. I had to vote no earlier and vote no again on the \nconference report. First and foremost are the reductions in Medicare \nand Medicaid over the next 7 years, in exchange, it seems to be, for \ntax cuts. Or at least the exchange is occurring somewhere. There is \n$270 billion in Medicare, $180 in Medicaid, $245 billion for the tax \ncuts.\n  Condition No. 1 for me, as a Democrat, is let us drop the tax cut. \nAgain, if we are going to ask people to sacrifice and take less in \ntheir Government, take less in the way of income from their Government, \nit seems to me one of the ways, one of the actions we need take to \nrestore fairness, is drop the idea of providing a tax cut which will \nbenefit less than half of the American homes. More than half of the \nAmerican homes will not even be impacted by this tax cut proposal. It \nseems to me that it is reasonable for us to say, at the beginning, let \nus drop that tax cut proposal.\n  I, as a Democrat, am willing, in exchange for that, to vote for some \nthings that I also think need to be included. I think the CPI does need \nto be adjusted, the Consumer Price Index that is used to adjust \ntransfer payments and used to adjust as well our Tax Code. It seems to \nme at least a half a point adjustment is reasonable. If you drop the \ntax cut and you drop the CPI, we will still be reducing the growth of \nMedicare and the growth of Medicaid. But we will be able to do it in a \nfashion, it seems to me, Mr. President, that is much more fair, much \nmore reasonable, and much more likely that, in a bipartisan fashion, we \ncan sell what will be nonetheless a difficult proposal to the American \npeople.\n\n  I, for one, as well, happen to believe if you are going to really \nreform our Medicare system and our entitlement system, that you do have \nto adjust the age. In the Entitlement Commission recommendation, \nSenator Danforth and I recommended, and Senator Simpson and I have a \nproposal on Social Security that phases in an adjustment of eligibility \nage for Social Security. I would propose to do the same thing in \nMedicare. Not for current beneficiaries, not for anybody who is \ncurrently in the program, but for future beneficiaries.\n  The longer we wait to do that the more difficult, it seems to me, it \nis going to be to break the news that when the baby boomers retire we \nhave this promise laying on the table we are simply not going to be \nable to keep.\n  I say to my Republican colleagues, I am willing to vote to drop the \nCPI by at least a half a point. I am willing to do the same thing on \neligibility age. I have no difficulty adjusting the premium for part B. \nIt is fair, it is reasonable, it ought to be done. It seems to me, at \nthe very least we should say no more than a 70 percent subsidy for part \nB Medicare. I am willing to vote for that.\n  But I do not want a tax cut proposal on there because I cannot sell \nit as fair. I cannot explain it as being necessary, because it is not \nnecessary. There are other ways for us to do this, to generate the \nsavings needed to balance the budget in 7 years and get us to that \nobjective.\n  The next thing I want to spend a little more time on is talking about \nthis idea of building a safety net. I listen to people talk, both at \nhome and as I watch the news and read the newspaper. Increasingly, \npeople are saying this debate has provoked their concern once again \nabout whether or not they are going to be able to have health care. \nWhy? Mr. President, in the State \n\n[[Page S17241]]\nof Texas, 50 percent of all babies are paid for by Medicaid. These are \nworking families out there. These are people who are earning the \nminimum wage or slightly above, that cannot afford to buy health \ninsurance. If you want to preserve and protect Medicare, if you have \never come to this floor and said let us preserve and protect Medicare, \nthe fundamental premise of that program is that at some point the \nmarket does not work, that we have to collectively look for some way to \nprovide for health care for people who either are not going to be able \nto afford to buy it or might be excluded as a consequence of some \nphysical condition on their part.\n  We need a safety net that guarantees health insurance to every single \nAmerican. No one should be left off the hook of having to pay. The \npayment ought to be based upon our capacity to pay.\n  Not only do I support a means testing, an affluence testing of \nMedicare, but I would love to see us change the eligibility and allow \nevery single American or every legal resident--once you pass those two \ntests, you know with certainty you have it. You can go out and work. \nYou can go out and pay attention to your education and do the sorts of \nthings you need to do to lift your earning power and do not worry that \nyou are going to lose health insurance.\n  I think we need a safety net in changing our retirement laws. I think \nwe need a safety net as well in education. The work force today places \na very heavy premium on those with skills. It seems to me one of the \nworst things about this proposal is that we are not increasing the \namount of money that families need to be able to send their children to \ncollege. It seems to me we are moving in the opposite direction in \ntrying to build the kind of safety net that we need for an active, \nvibrant market economy.\n  Finally, Mr. President, I would like to talk about something I have \ntalked about ad nauseam on this floor a time or two before, and that is \nthis question of entitlements as a percent of our budget and what this \ndoes to our ability to invest in education, transportation, research, \nthose things that either will improve the quality of our lives like \nparks or helping those who are mentally retarded. Whatever it is we \ndecide we want to do to strengthen our conscience, we are decreasing \nour ability to do it as entitlements as a percent of our budget grow. \nThis year, it is 34.5 percent for domestic spending. At the end of this \nbudget proposal it is 26.5 percent.\n  Now, percentages do not mean much to us typically, so let me try to \nconvert that. If you think this year's budget is tough on \nappropriations, wait until 2002. I do not think we can do the things \nthat are required in this budget proposal. If you think you can, do not \ntry to construct a budget with these numbers.\n  Mr. President, 27.5 percent gives you $435 billion for defense and \nnondefense spending. Let us presume we spend $263 billion on defense, \nwhich we did this year. I think we can spend slightly less than that. \nNo matter what you do, you are going to spend $255 to $265 billion on \ndefense. So let us take $263 billion out, which is this year's \nspending, which I presume most, if not all, of the Republicans believe \nought to occur. That leaves you $172 billion.\n  I know the occupant of the chair, who is on the Appropriations \nCommittee, probably is familiar with this, but let me just show you \nwhat I have done. I take $18.7 billion for law enforcement, for drug \nefforts, for the FBI, for Border Patrol, for the U.S. attorneys; I take \n$17 billion for international affairs--I did not really pull these \nbecause they are my priorities; I just pulled some numbers--$17 \nbillion, slightly more than 1 percent of our entire budget; $20 billion \nappropriated for veterans--that is veterans' pensions that are only \nappropriated accounts; $10 billion for community efforts such as the \nCDBG efforts; $17 billion for science and space; $38 billion for \ntransportation; $53 billion for all of education and training.\n  Mr. President, that is $174 billion. Right there you have $174 \nbillion. So I ask those who say: Well, that is fine, what are you going \nto do about the NIH? What are you going to do about all environmental \nprotection, all of housing, the management of our national parks, \ndisaster relief, natural resources management? The list goes on and on \nand on.\n  The answer is you cannot do it. There is not a single Member of this \nbody, I suggest to my colleagues, who could come to the floor and tell \nme, make a proposal that would show how we are going to in the year \n2002 allocate defense and nondefense with only $435 billion. It is not \npossible.\n  It is not desirable either, I might point out, for us to be heading \nin that direction. If you think that is bad in 2002, just look a little \nbeyond that when my generation starts to retire. Instead of a 1-percent \nerosion of operations, which is about $15 billion a year, it will \ndouble in the year 2008, and then it is too late. Then the kinds of \nchanges that we have to put in place, the kinds of changes that we have \nto put in place will cut current beneficiaries of Social Security and \nMedicare. It will cut current beneficiaries substantially or we are \ngoing to have to say to our young people in the work force: We have to \nhave a substantial increase in your payroll taxes in order to be able \nto cover the bills.\n  I am here to say again I appreciate the work that the Republicans \nhave done in trying to tackle this problem. There are other problems \nthat need to be addressed that are left unaddressed in this proposal. \nIt is going to be vetoed by the President. It is going to be sent back \nhere, and it will be up to the Republican leadership. Do we embrace the \nranking Democrat on the Budget Committee, who is one of the most \nfiscally conservative Members of this body. For gosh sakes, if he and \nthe chairman cannot put together a balanced budget, I do not know who \nelse can.\n  The question will occur, when the Republican leadership package is \nvetoed and sent back, not can you not find Democrats who will support \nit, but will you make an active effort to recruit and bring us into the \nprocess and say, what are your standards of fairness? What are the \nthings you want before you will support this proposal? I think there is \nthe will to balance the budget, but there is a desire to do an awful \nlot more than that. I hope that after this bill is vetoed and after it \nis sent back to us and after we have unsuccessfully attempted to \noverride it, that those who want to balance the budget will join those \nof us on this side who want to balance the budget as well. I hope you \nwill turn to us and give us an opportunity to participate.\n\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. ABRAHAM addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. At this time I yield 20 minutes to the Senator from \nDelaware, the chairman of the Finance Committee.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The distinguished Senator from Delaware is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, today we are closer than ever to meeting \nfour fundamental promises we made to the American people when we \npromised to balance the budget. This legislation offers a balanced \nbudget. We promised to save Medicare, a critical program for our \nelderly. This legislation preserves and strengthens Medicare. We \npromised to reform welfare, to end the perverse incentives that have \nfound us spending more and more money only to find more and more \nchildren living under the poverty level. We have provided in this \nlegislation real reforms. And, finally, we promised to cut taxes on \nAmericans everywhere, to reverse the record-setting Clinton increases \nthat even the President admits were too high. And with this important \nbalanced budget package we have done just that.\n  I am encouraged by all that this legislative package offers--the \nBalanced Budget Act of 1995. I am concerned that certain political \ndynamics that have overtaken this debate are obscuring the real \nimportance of what we are offering today.\n  On its most fundamental level, this legislation is about change, real \nchange in Government. It is the beginning of a new era, a redesigning \nof the way Washington does business. Certainly, given the monumental \nissues this package addresses, we can understand why President Clinton \nhas forced us to an impasse. Make no mistake, this legislation is \nrevolutionary. It begins to \n\n[[Page S17242]]\nmake changes in the way Government has done business over the last 50 \nyears. It takes the large, overbearing, income-eating, inefficient \nFederal monolith, a government that was designed for the industrial \nage, and it prepares it for the 21st century.\n  Making this kind of change is not easy. Institutions resist \nmodernization. They even resist improvements. For this reason, many \nonce mighty civilizations have fallen. On the other hand, growth and \nopportunity come from change. As the philosophers say, ``The mixture \nwhich is not shaken decomposes. Progress lies in changing things that \nare.''\n  Our Government needs to change. We need to balance the budget. This \nis not only the responsible thing to do, it is necessary for a strong, \nvibrant economy. A balanced budget will lower rates. It will create \njobs. Some forecast that over 6 million jobs would be created if the \nbudget were balanced.\n  A balanced budget would also provide a higher standard of living for \nall Americans. A balanced budget will reduce the burden of debt on \nfuture generations. Again, this is a moral responsibility. As Thomas \nPaine argued, ``* * * no parent, or master, nor all the authority of \nparliament * * * can bind or control the personal freedom of their \nposterity.'' But that is exactly what our Government, with 50 years of \ntax and spend policies, has done. A child born today owes more than \n$185,000 in interest alone on the Federal debt.\n  If he or she were to pay the debt, it would literally conscript him \nor her to a lifetime tax rate of 84 percent. Now, we have the \nresponsibility to do something about this, and the package before us \ntoday is the beginning of a real and lasting solution. President \nClinton in his first State of the Union address maintained that any \neconomic forecasting should be performed by the nonpartisan \nCongressional Budget Office.\n  Mr. President, the CBO maintains that our program balanced the budget \nin 7 years. To balance the budget, of course, we must control the \ngrowth of Government, and controlling growth does not mean cutting or \nabolishing important programs. It simply means that we must bring \nspending into line with reality. It means getting back within our \nbudget, within our ability to pay for necessary programs and making \nthese programs as efficient and cost effective as possible, and that is \nwhat we accomplish with this legislation.\n  I understand that there are basic philosophical differences at play \nin this current debate. There are honorable representatives and \narguments on both sides of the issue, each promoting a vision of \nGovernment. Now, those who argue for the status quo believe in the \nstatus quo. They have faith in big Government. They trust big \nGovernment. And they see it as the solution to very real concerns. \nOthers--and I count myself among this latter group--believe Government \nneeds to be reformed and that growth in Government spending needs to be \nslowed down.\n  We look at welfare and see that, despite the fact that Government has \nspent more than $5 trillion--let me repeat--has spent more than $5 \ntrillion over the last 30 years, the program is a catastrophe. We see \nthat in 1965 some 15.6 percent of all families with children under the \nage of 18 lived below the poverty level. By 1993, that number had grown \nto 18.5 percent. In other words, we see that despite the fact that \nGovernment has thrown trillions and trillions of dollars at the \nproblem, the problem has only become worse.\n  Likewise, the pathologies associated with welfare--\ncrime, illegitimacy, drug abuse, child neglect, and others--have \nincreased to alarming proportions. And we see that between 1965 and \n1992, the number of children receiving AFDC has grown by nearly 200 \npercent, even while the entire population of children under the age of \n18 declined by 5.5 percent during this same period of time.\n\n  Mr. President, big Government has not worked. In Medicare, big \nGovernment has created a program rife with waste, fraud, and abuse. Big \nGovernment has literally run the system to the point of bankruptcy. We \nall know what President Clinton's own commission has said.\n  And I quote:\n\n       The Hospital Insurance Trust Fund (part A) continues to be \n     severely out of financial balance and is projected to be \n     exhausted in about seven years. The SMI Trust Fund (part B), \n     while in balance on an annual basis, shows a rate of growth \n     of costs which is clearly unsustainable.\n\n  Again, I am repeating what President Clinton's own commissioners had \nto say.\n\n       Moreover, [they continue] this fund is projected to be 75 \n     percent or more financed by general revenues, so that given \n     the general budget deficit problem, it is a major contributor \n     to the larger fiscal problems of the nation. The Medicare \n     program is clearly unsustainable in its present form.\n\n  Again, this analysis of Medicare's current crisis comes from the \nadministration's own trustees. And what we propose today is a solution.\n  Mr. President, we also propose real tax relief. Big Government has \nsuccessfully pilfered the taxpayer's pocket. Real Federal taxes per \nhousehold now top $12,000 a year. Total Government taxes, Federal, \nState, local, reach $18,500 per household. The Federal regulatory \nburden, which can also be considered a tax, exceeds $6,000 a year. \nThese numbers have been constantly rising, even as the Government has \nfallen deeper and deeper into debt.\n  For example, Federal taxes now take nearly 25 percent of our median \nhousehold income every year, up from about 16 percent in 1970. This \nincessant increase in taxes has stifled economic growth. It is \nengendered irresponsibility in Government spending, even perverse \nincentives where programs grow based on their inefficiencies and \nwasteful practices. And all this has to stop.\n  Let this legislation serve as the catalyst for real reform. It \nsuccessfully balances the budget in 7 years by controlling the growth \nof spending while promoting economic growth. It preserves and \nstrengthens Medicare by allowing the program to grow at about twice the \nrate of inflation and by introducing choice in the system. In this way, \nseniors are guaranteed continued coverage as well as the ability to \nchoose those plans and health care providers that best meet their \nneeds.\n\n  In this bill, Medicare spending increases from $178 billion in 1995 \nto $286 billion in 2002. Average spending per beneficiary grows 7.7 \npercent per year, or from $4,800 to $7,100. Remember, President Clinton \nhimself said, ``Medicare [is] going up three times the rate of \ninflation. We propose to let it go up at two times the rate of \ninflation. This is not a Medicare . . . cut.'' That is a quote of \nPresident Clinton himself.\n  Our proposal controls runaway costs by introducing choice into the \nsystem. It gives our seniors the ability to remain in the current fee-\nfor-service plan, if that is what they want. There is no change, no cut \nin any of the medical services available today.\n  But, in addition, we also offer them an unlimited number of health \ncare plan options that they may choose to better meet their needs. Our \nplan also aggressively attacks fraud and abuse in the Medicare Program. \nThe GAO estimates the loss to Medicare from fraud and abuse equals some \n10 percent of the program's total spending, and law enforcement \nofficials claim that the majority of Medicare fraud goes undetected.\n  Our proposal directs the Secretary of HHS and the Attorney General to \nestablish a national health care fraud and abuse control program to \ncoordinate Federal, State and local law enforcement efforts in this \narea. We earmark some $150 million in the first year to use \nspecifically for investigations and prosecutions of health care fraud.\n  We also offer a number of new tools to assist investigators and \nprosecutors in attacking this problem. The CBO has estimated that our \nprovisions in this area will save the program more than $3.5 billion \nover 7 years.\n  Mr. President, these are the kinds of reforms we must make to \npreserve and to strengthen important programs. In welfare reform, we \nmust reverse perverse incentives that have sapped the spirit of so many \nAmericans, perverse incentives that have engendered dependency on \nGovernment and contributed to decay and even moral decline within our \ncities.\n  We must give Americans, as I say, tax relief. President Clinton, by \nhis recent admission that he raised taxes too high, recognizes that our \nfamilies are stretched beyond reasonable limits. High taxes kill \nsavings, risk taking, incentive and economic opportunity. High taxes \nundermine job creation. \n\n[[Page S17243]]\n\n  We offer Americans $245 billion in tax relief over 7 years. This \nincludes a $500 per child credit, relief from the marriage penalty and \ntax credits for adoptions and deductions for student loans. This relief \ngives our families incentives to save. That President Clinton has \nelected to shut down the Government rather than work with us towards \nachieving these objectives is, indeed, a mystery.\n  Again, he once proposed a child tax credit, a credit of up to $800. \nNow, as with Medicare and welfare and even balancing the budget, he is \nbacking away from his promises. Not only this, some are even attempting \nto make political hay out of the tax relief we are offering, trying to \ntie it to our efforts to slow the runaway growth in Medicare.\n  Let me say again that tax relief does not come at the expense of \nMedicare. As the Washington Post points out:\n  ``The Democrats have fabricated the Medicare-tax cut connection \nbecause it is useful politically.''\n  In an earlier editorial, the Post stated that ``the Democrats are \nengaged in demagoguery, big time. And it's wrong. * * *''\n  It goes on to say:\n\n       [the Republicans] have a plan. Enough is known about it to \n     say it's credible; it's gutsy and in some respects \n     inventive--and it addresses a genuine problem that is only \n     going to get worse. What Democrats have on the other hand is \n     a lot of expostulation, TV ads and scare talk.\n  We must get beyond the scare talks. We must get beyond the political \nposturing that has brought the greatest Government on Earth to a \nstandstill. The American people deserve better. They deserve a \nGovernment that works, a Government that works for them.\n  This, of course, is not the first time Government has been shut down. \nRonald Reagan shut the Government down because during his tenure, \nCongress wanted to spend too much. Today, Clinton has shut it down \nbecause he wants to spend too much.\n  Look at the numbers, Mr. President. We cannot afford the waste, \ngrowth and inefficiency of the last 50 years, but what we can afford \nare the well-conceived, workable reforms contained in this Balanced \nBudget Act of 1995. I stand behind it, and I urge the President to sign \nit.\n  Mr. President, I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. KENNEDY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under an earlier order, the Senator from \nMassachusetts [Mr. Kennedy], is recognized for 15 minutes.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I thank the Chair. Mr. President, I always welcome the \nopportunity to hear our Republican friends talk about reducing the \ndeficit. I remember in 1980 when President Reagan was elected, we had \nabout a $465 billion deficit, and all during that period of time of \nPresident Reagan and President Bush, we went up to $4.7 trillion, all \nrun up during that period of time. It is always interesting to me, \nPresident Reagan requested higher budgets than were actually approved \nby the Democratic Congress.\n  Then we had President Clinton's program that went into effect that \nreduced the deficit by $600 billion. It is useful, as we examine what I \nconsider an extreme resolution that is before us and budget before us, \nto put in some context exactly which party and who has been trying to \ndo something about the deficit and basically who have been talking \nabout it. Of course, as history points out, we did not get one single \nRepublican vote when we put in place the deficit reduction program.\n  As was mentioned by other Members, by those Senators on the other \nside, this really is an issue of priority. I welcome the opportunity to \ncompare the priorities. It is now clear to the whole country that this \nis not a conflict about a balanced budget, it is a dispute about \nfundamental American values and priorities.\n  The Republican budget plan is a program to sacrifice senior citizens, \nstudents and children and working families in order to pay for lavish \ntax breaks for the wealthiest individuals and corporations in America. \nIt is a program to destroy Medicare, to benefit the rich. It is a \nprogram to slash aid to education and trash the environment. It raids \nprivate pension funds, closes the door of colleges and universities to \nthe sons and daughters of working families, dumps over a million \nmore children into poverty in a misguided version of welfare reform.\n\n  In page after page of this legislation, Republicans offer an open \nhand to powerful special interests and the back of their hand to \neveryone else.\n  Republicans pretend their continuing resolution is not about raising \nMedicare premiums, but their reconciliation bill certainly is--$52 \nbillion in additional premiums over the next 7 years, an additional \n$2,500 in premiums for every elderly couple. That is only the tip of \nthe iceberg.\n  The overall Republican cuts in Medicare total $270 billion. The \ntrustees said what was necessary was $87 billion; their cut $270 \nbillion. Compare that to the $245 billion in Republican tax breaks for \nthe wealthy. You do not have to be a rocket scientist to understand \nthat shameful arithmetic.\n  The Republican Medicare plan is also carefully constructed to force \nsenior citizens to give up their own doctors and join HMO's and other \nprivate insurance plans. That means billions of dollars in higher \nprofits for the insurance firms at the expense of elderly Americans.\n  Why are all the insurance companies supporting this particular \nproposal? Because they recognize it opens the opportunities for \nbillions and billions in profits.\n  The Republican Medicare plan may be Heaven for the health insurance \nindustry, but it is hell on senior citizens.\n  Senior citizens also depend on Medicaid for nursing home care and \nother services Medicare does not cover. Medicaid provides the health \ncare for one-fifth of the Nation's children and for millions of \nAmerican families with family members with disabilities.\n  It is interesting, 18 million children are on Medicaid; 94 percent of \nthose children's parents work; 65 percent of them work full time. These \nare sons and daughters of hard-working Americans that are going to be \ncast adrift under this proposal that is before us.\n  The Republicans do not care about their health care. They cut \nMedicaid by $180 billion. By the year 2002, it will be slashed by one-\nthird. Effectively, with the program for 7 years, they are taking 2 \nyears of the payment out. They are taking that out of the program and \ngiving it back to the States and saying, ``Provide better services for \nthem.''\n  Millions of our needy citizens will lose. Last year, the Republicans \nblocked health reform that would have guaranteed coverage for all this \nyear. They are taking away the coverage from those who now have it.\n  The giveaways go on. The weakening of the nursing home standards was \ndefeated in the Senate by 95 to 1, but the weakened standards are back \nin the final Republican bill; liens on the homes of nursing home \nresidents, defeated on the floor of the U.S. Senate, but the liens are \nback in the bill; permission for doctors to charge more than Medicare \nwill pay, defeated in the Senate, back in the bill; weakened antifraud \nstandards, defeated in the Senate, back in the bill. The casualty list \nfor senior citizens goes on and on.\n  We have distributed a fact sheet laying out some of these back-room \ndeals in more detail. On education, the Republican budget is a triumph \nof special interests over student interests. It is rigged to funnel \nover $100 billion in new business to banks and money lenders at the \nexpense of colleges and students. It is hard to find a more vivid or \ndisgraceful example of the prostitution of Republican principles. When \nprofits are at stake, Republicans are more willing to sell out the free \nmarket competition and replace it with the heavy hand of Government-\nguaranteed monopoly.\n  The Republican budget also drastically cuts education. It slashes \nFederal aid by a third. It cuts aid for school reform. It cuts college \nstudent assistance by $5 billion. It caps the direct lending program at \nthe ridiculously low level of 10 percent. Twelve-hundred colleges and \nuniversities will be forced out of this program they want for their \nstudents. Why? So the banks and guaranteed agencies can profit to the \ntune of $103 billion in new business over the next 7 years, and the \nbest estimate is that it will be $7 to $9 billion in profits that ought \nto be used to lower the cost of education for the children of this \ncountry.\n  For children, this bill is a nightmare. There is a right way and a \nwrong way to reform welfare. Punishing children is the wrong way. \nDenying job training \n\n[[Page S17244]]\nand work opportunities is the wrong way. Leaving States holding the bag \nis the wrong way. This bill takes a bad Senate bill and makes it worse. \nThe Senate bill eliminated 60 years of a good-faith national commitment \nto protect all needy children. This conference report adds insult to \ninjury by guaranteeing increased suffering for millions of children and \nfamilies.\n  The Senate bill cuts food stamps for 14 million children, SSI \nbenefits for 225,000 disabled children and protection for 100,000 \nabused children. This conference report slashes these essential \nprograms by $82 billion--$17 billion more than the Senate bill. \nNutrition programs, disability benefits, and antichild abuse programs \nwill suffer heavily.\n  If the conference report becomes law, children born to parents on \nwelfare will be punished in every State. Victims of domestic violence \nwill lose their special protection. Food stamps for the unemployed will \nbe further restricted. Family preservation and child abuse programs \nwill be block granted. Family hardship exemptions and State investment \nrequirements will be reduced. All this is above and beyond the Senate \nbill. Even the modest child care provisions added to the Republican \n``home alone'' bill in the Senate have been rolled back.\n  This bill cuts essential child care funding and eliminates essential \nprotections for children and child care. As a result, many more \nchildren will be left home alone, and countless others will find \nthemselves in unsafe conditions. The bill cuts more than a billion \ndollars from the Senate-passed welfare bill by stretching out the $3 \nbillion in new funds over 7 years and capping the child care \ndevelopment block grant for low-income working families. It eliminates \nany real requirements for States to ensure adequate health and safety \nprotection for children in child care. It repeals the requirements for \nStates to adopt minimal health and safety provisions for immunizations, \nbuilding safety, and appropriate health and safety training for anyone \nreceiving Federal funds.\n  These provisions were negotiated by Senator Hatch and the Bush \nadministration, and they have had broad bipartisan support--until now. \nIn addition, the Republicans have cut more than 50 percent of the funds \nset aside to improve the quality of child care. Report after report \ndocuments the shocking poor quality of child care in far too many child \ncare settings. These funds are making a measurable difference in the \ndevelopment and growth of low-income children.\n  What is happening is the standards, which were established by Senator \nHatch and Senator Dodd, signed by President Bush, have been \nsignificantly weakened. It is so interesting that we are prepared to \ngive real standards of protection for the child care in the military, \nand we deny them to the civilian workers of this country. Any man or \nwoman in this body can go out and visit a child care center on any \nmilitary base, and they will find it is up to standards. There were \nonly six votes in this body against those kind of standards when we did \nit for the military. But when you are talking about dealing with poor \npeople, you take those standards and safety net away. You know what is \ngoing to happen? In another 1 or 2 years, there will be a study and it \nwill talk about how all of these programs have deteriorated and people \nwill say that is what happens when you have a Federal program, and \nthere will be pressure to provide less and less support for those poor \nchildren, and more and more tax giveaways for the wealthy in this \ncountry. It is wrong.\n  If this bill passes, the Senate will be turning its back on needy \nchildren, on poor mothers struggling to make ends meet--millions of our \nfellow citizens who need help the most.\n  The Republican priorities are clear: For millionaires they will move \nmountains; for poor children, they will not even lift a finger. We all \nwant to balance the budget, but it cannot and should not be done on the \nbacks of America's children. Enough is enough. Enough of the back room \ndeals with high-paid corporate lobbyists. Enough of dismantling \ncommitments to children and families in need.\n\n  In the end, this is a battle for the heart and soul of this Nation. \nIt is a simple question of priorities. Are we going to leave millions \nof low-income children behind in order to give huge tax breaks to the \nrich?\n  This bill is legislative child abuse at its worst.\n  A further outrageous provision in the reconciliation is the hunting \nlicense it gives corporations to raid employee pension plans and divert \nbillions of dollars in retirement funds to other purposes.\n  Despite the overwhelming 94-5 vote by the Senate 3 weeks ago to strip \nthe indefensible pension raid from the Senate bill, the Republican \nmajority persist in their reckless scheme to turn private pension plans \ninto piggy banks for corporate raiders and greedy executives at the \nexpense of the retirement security of millions of Americans.\n  One other decision by the Republican conferees vividly demonstrates \nwhat this debate is about. All year, Democrats have tried to close the \nso-called billionaires' tax loophole, which lets wealthy Americans \nrenounce their American citizenship to evade their fair share of taxes \non the massive wealth they have accumulated in America. Have we heard \nany Member of that side defend that provision? The silence is \ndeafening. It is difficult to imagine a more obscene loophole. Every \ntime we have raised it in the Senate, no one tries to defend it. Once \nagain, behind closed doors, the Republicans have saved it. The \nbillionaires' loophole is alive and well in this bill. Shame on the \nRepublican Ways and Means Committee. I doubt if they have ever sunk \nlower.\n  The Republicans claim that their plan provides a balanced budget, but \nit is profoundly out of balance. It tilts the scales heavily to the \nwealthy and the powerful at the expense of ordinary Americans. The \nRepublicans know that President Clinton will never sign this bill. They \nknow that Congress will never override his veto. The question is: How \nlong this shut-down-the-Government tantrum will go on before they \nrealize the American people are not buying what the Republicans are \nselling and never will.\n  I yield to the Senator from Maryland.\n  Mr. SARBANES. I listened very carefully to the Senator from \nMassachusetts with respect to the impact of this reconciliation bill on \nchildren. Is it not the case that if the tax break provisions of this \nreconciliation were not in this package--in other words, this $250 \nbillion worth of tax breaks for the very wealthy--these drastic cuts \nwith respect to these programs for children would not have to be made, \nis that not correct?\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Well, the Senator is absolutely correct. And to further \nadd to the Senator's point, the Senator understands that for every \ndollar that you cut, both in education and in child care, you increase \nthe cost to society by 3 or 4 more dollars. So if you are looking at \nthis, either from a bottom-line point of view about what the costs are \ngoing to be over any period of time, or looking at it--I think all of \nus would like to think that the way we are looking at it is caring for \nthe child. It makes absolutely no sense, what they have done.\n  Mr. SARBANES. The costs accumulate. But the fact is--and people must \nunderstand this--that in order to give tax breaks to very wealthy \npeople, draconian cuts are being made in these programs to help \nchildren. So there is a direct tradeoff that has to be understood. In \nother words, these cuts are happening to child care, to feeding \nprograms, education programs, and others, in order to accumulate a pot \nof money with which to give tax breaks to wealthy people. If you did \nnot give the tax breaks, you would not have to make the cuts, is that \nnot correct?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. The Senator is absolutely correct.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  \n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/11/17/senate-section/article/S17227-1", "month": "11", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "17", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S17245]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n[[Page S17245]]\n\n_______________________________________________________________________\n\n                              N O T I C E\nIncomplete record of Senate proceedings.

Mr. President, throughout the day, I have been in \nconsultation with Members of the House of Representatives representing \nnorthern Virginia and other regions, as well as many other of the \nSenators here, including my distinguished colleague, Senator Lott.\n  On behalf of many Senators, I say to our distinguished whip--at the \nmoment, the acting majority leader--there is a strong desire to put the \nGovernment back to work, but doing it only once we reach an agreement \non this CR. It had been my hope and expectation today that, assuming \nthe President agrees to not more than 7 years for the decision to reach \nand get a balanced budget--that is the keystone of the architecture on \nwhich to build a compromise, given that we can reach a level of \nexpenditures which would enable the Government to function between now \nand, say, the middle of December. That leaves the middle ground of the \nimportant method by which the economic assumptions are made, which \nassumptions lay out the course to reach a balanced budget by no later \nthan 2002. And I will be a part of the meetings tomorrow on this CR \nwith the distinguished acting majority leader. But I hope that you can \nprovide some encouragement that this area of the economic assumptions \nwill be examined in terms of some measure of compromise.\n  Mr. LOTT. If the Senator will yield for a response, Mr. President, I \ndo want to take note of the fact that there have been discussions \nunderway today between the majority leadership and the White House \nrepresentatives. I know the Senator from Virginia has been following \nthat very closely. I know he and the majority leader and the Members of \nCongress would like to see this matter resolved so that we could get an \nagreement on the level of the continuing spending resolution; but, more \nimportantly, that we also get a commitment to this 7-year balanced \nbudget; the two are linked together. They are very important, and we \nbelieve that an agreement should be reached so that the Federal workers \nin this area, and around the country, should and can go back to work.\n  We feel that the President should commit to that 7-year balanced \nbudget by the year 2002. We think there must be honest numbers in how \nthat is achieved. It cannot be done by some of the smoke and mirrors we \nhave seen in the past. But the efforts will continue Saturday morning, \nas the Senator noted. I know he will be here on duty working to try to \nachieve that goal. I think it is possible, and I certainly hope it can \nbe done. And if it is done, then we can go forward with serious \nnegotiations to reach an agreement to achieve a balanced budget for all \nof the people of this country.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished leader. Just a \nconcluding observation. Assuming that we can get a CR--and I strongly \nbelieve if we can reach some form of understanding on the manner in \nwhich we establish the economic assumptions, we could have a very \nstrong participation from the Democratic side; and given that \nbipartisanship, it is this Senator's belief that we could then hope to \nhave an equally strong bipartisan and serious address of this important \nact we just passed, the balanced budget act of 1995.\n  Mr. LOTT. To respond, I certainly hope so. Again, I want to emphasize \nthat it is important that it be very carefully worded, carefully \ncrafted. We cannot agree to wording that would not achieve the goals \nthat were voted on just a short time ago here in this body of a \nbalanced budget in 7 years. We faced the tough decisions, we have made \nthem, we voted for it, and it is passed.\n\n  But if we can get the agreement along the lines we talked about, I \nthink it would have very strong bipartisan support. As a matter of \nfact, I know that there is growing support on both sides of the aisle \nto make this commitment to a balanced budget. We did not get any votes \nfrom the other side of the aisle just a few minutes ago, but I know \nthere is a growing discomfort because three-fourths of the American \npeople fully believe we should have a balanced budget. They want that \ncommitment. And what the President has been saying, quite frankly, is \nhe wants more spending, and he does not want a balanced budget. That is \nbeginning to have a negative impact on him. So I think there is \nmovement, and there should be. We should work this out. We should do \nthe people's business. The President vetoed the continuing resolution \nthat provided for more spending. He shut down the Government. But \neverybody has made their points now, and we need to get serious about \nreaching an agreement. I think that it is possible.\n  Mr. WARNER. I thank the distinguished acting majority leader, and \nparticularly for his invaluable service as a liaison with the House on \nthis, in bringing to bear his experience there as whip.

Mr. President, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  Mr. President, I say very briefly there is once again information on \nthe floor that must be corrected: the argument that the tax cuts \nincluded in the Balanced Budget Act of 1995 are going to the very \nwealthy in our country. In fact, Mr. President, 65 percent of all the \ntax cuts that are being provided for in this legislation go to people \nwho are making less than $75,000 a year, 80 percent goes to people \nmaking less than $100,000.\n  If you are in those categories, according to what we have just heard, \nyou are rich. In my State of Michigan, people making less than $75,000 \na year are not the wealthiest people in America, and I do not think \nthey are the wealthiest people in America or any other State.\n  The other claim, Mr. President, with respect to children, I think it \nis hard to argue that the policies which we are changing with this \nlegislation are going to be worse for children than what we have seen \nunder the policies that have been in existence for so many years.\n  Today, more children and more people are in poverty than when the war \non poverty began. Today, children in America born this year are faced \nwith huge debts that we have been running up on the Federal \nGovernment's unlimited credit card. There can be no greater punishment \nfor the children in America today than to let the spending spree in \nWashington continue. That will continue if we do not pass the Balanced \nBudget Act which we are dealing with right now.\n  I yield 11 minutes to the Senator from Rhode Island, of the 15 we \nhave allotted, and then 5 minutes to the Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, first I want to say I listened to the \nMembers of the Democratic side speak this afternoon and, with the \nexception of the Senator from Nebraska, I have not heard one of them \nstep up to the plate and try to do something about the deficits the \ncountry is facing.\n  Yes, they attack everything we have done, every proposal we have, but \nthey have not offered a single proposal of their own to address what I \nbelieve is the most serious domestic problem facing this Nation of \nours, which is the continuing deficits.\n  True, there is a lot of mileage in being against it and they are \nexperts at it. The word ``shame'' was used by the Senator from \nMassachusetts about the approach we have taken. I say shame to those on \nthat side who criticize but offer no alternatives.\n  With few exceptions, there is little willingness on that side of the \naisle to tangle with this desperate problem that our country faces.\n  Mr. President, I believe that we truly do face a historic choice: to \nput our Nation on a path to a balanced budget by passing this Balanced \nBudget Act, or to continue business as usual, borrowing from our \nchildren and grandchildren to meet current Federal obligations.\n  This is the first time, Mr. President, in my 19 years in the Senate \nthat we have had the opportunity to vote on a balanced budget. Yes, we \nhave made attempts in the past to reduce the deficit. We had the Gramm-\nRudman plan, firewalls, all kinds of approaches, but never have we had \nthe political courage in both branches to make the tough choices to \nproduce a balanced budget.\n  Whether one agrees with this legislation or not, it clearly \nrepresents a bold and a decisive step. Those courageous enough to vote \nfor it deserve kudos, particularly in the House of Representatives, \nwhere they face the voters every 2 years.\n  As a Senator, as a parent, as a grandparent and as a concerned \ncitizen, Mr. President, I have come to believe, as I mentioned before, \nthat the deficit is the most pressing domestic problem our Nation \nfaces. We cannot continue on this reckless course of spending more than \nwe take in. Individuals and families, obviously, have to live within \ntheir budgets. So should our national Government.\n  Now, the Federal deficit is literally snowballing downhill, totally \nout of control. In 1980, we had a national debt of $1 trillion. This \namount was amassed over a period of 200 years, from the inception of \nthe Republic. Yet from 1980 to the present--just 15 years, we have run \nup $4 trillion more--four times what it took us 200 years to \naccumulate. So now our national debt has reached almost $5 trillion.\n  Absent decisive action, we are looking at annual deficits continuing \nout into the future of $200 billion a year. In other words, every 5 \nyears we will add another $1 trillion of debt to the bill we are \nsending to future generations of Americans to pay.\n  Interest alone, never mind paying down that principal, is the third \nlargest expenditure in the Federal budget. The largest is Social \nSecurity, the second largest is defense, the third largest is interest \non the debt.\n  Mr. President, $235 billion a year. That is nearly a quarter of a \ntrillion dollars that will not be available for better education, \nbetter schools, more help to college students, disease prevention, \nimproved health, better housing, and more environmental protection. \nThis staggering debt burden prevents us from making those expenditures, \nand obviously the $235 billion this year will go up every year.\n  Thus, I am committed to reaching a balanced budget within a specified \ntime period, and the Balanced Budget Act will accomplish that objective \nwithin 7 years, by the year 2002. \n\n[[Page S 17248]]\n\n  Whether one agrees with all of the provisions of this or not, there \nis another very important reason to vote for the Balanced Budget Act. \nIt will get us beyond the current budget impasse and on to direct \nnegotiations with the President.\n  As far as I am concerned, the sooner we get to the negotiating table \nwith the administration, the better. We need to get beyond the finger \npointing and on to negotiations. We must get past this veto--which \neveryone agrees is going to take place--and on to constructive, \nbipartisan dialog with the White House, and congressional Democrats, to \nbalance this Federal budget within 7 years.\n  Now, a new forecast was conducted at the University of Rhode Island \nindicating that my State is still languishing in the doldrums of a \nprotracted recession. At best, the recovery we have experienced over \nthe past several years has been uneven and anemic. This continued \nstagnation is sapping the vitality of my State and dashing the hopes of \nmany of its citizens.\n  We need to get this entire economy moving--from one end of the \ncountry to the other--and balancing the budget is the single most \nimportant step we can take to make this country prosper. This is not me \nsaying this. This is the Chairman of the Federal Reserve, Dr. Alan \nGreenspan, and a host of economists that testified before the Finance \nCommittee earlier this year.\n  The very action of enacting legislation to put us on the path to a \nbalanced budget, with annual deficits on a downward trend, would \nprovide an almost immediate reduction in short and long-term interest \nrates. This, in turn, would do several things. It would free up capital \nto fuel growth, increase demand for goods and services, and increase \nemployment in our country.\n  For consumers, the cost of financing a college education for their \nchildren, buying an automobile, or financing a home, would all come \ndown in response to falling interest rates. For businesses, the cost of \nborrowing capital would become more affordable, enabling them to \nexpand, and to create new jobs.\n  Now, Mr. President, I do not agree with every aspect of this massive \nbill. I say without hesitation or regret that I fought the good fight \non a number of issues about which I care deeply, with some success and \nsome failures.\n  However, when the goal is as important as securing the economic \nfuture of our Nation, as I believe it is, one works to advance the \nprocess despite any misgivings one might have.\n  That said, I would like to offer a few of my own thoughts to those \nwho will have the difficult task of negotiating a final agreement with \nthe administration once this bill is vetoed. When the negotiations \nconvene in early December, I am confident an agreement can be reached \nif both sides come to the table in good faith.\n  Here are my suggestions for them.\n  At a time when we are trying to balance the budget, I believe tax \ncuts are difficult to justify. I, personally, am against any the tax \ncuts. However, if we are to have some tax reductions, they should not \nbecome effective until substantial progress has been made toward \nreaching our goal of a balanced budget by the year 2002.\n  Both sides have proposed tax cuts. The administration rails against \nour tax cut proposal but, indeed, the President has also proposed tax \ncuts totaling more than $100 billion. I believe both sides should defer \nthe implementation of any tax cuts.\n  Second, congressional Republicans are exactly right in taking \nsignificant steps to control the future growth of Medicare. The long-\nterm financial problems facing this program must be addressed in a \nforthright manner. The President and congressional Democrats must step \nup to the plate on this issue.\n  By the way, I hope everybody saw the editorial in yesterday's \nWashington Post, hardly a mouthpiece for the Republican Party, which \nexcoriated the Democrats for their failure to face up to this issue of \nMedicare. The President and the congressional Democrats are equally to \nblame for failing to offer real solutions to the problems confronting \nthe Medicare program. We Republicans believe in income-testing, \nrequiring wealthier citizens to pay more for Medicare, as well as other \nentitlement programs. In addition, steps must be taken to conform \nMedicare administration and management with modern insurance practices. \nMoreover, we should give seniors more choices, such as choosing an HMO, \nor Preferred Provider Organization. I strongly believe we should not \nreduce Part B premiums because doing so would require additional tax \ndollars, further increasing the deficit of our Nation. In this regard, \nthe Republican budget plan keeps the premiums at exactly the same \npercentage that they are today, 31.5 percent.\n  Republicans are right in insisting upon a fixed timetable of 7 years \nto reach a balanced budget. We have repeatedly promised fiscal \ndiscipline and repeatedly failed to deliver it. So, when people \nsuggest, oh, you can do it in 9 years, in 10 years, or 15 years--\nbeware. Let us set an early date. I believe 7 years is a reasonable \none. That is not tomorrow, that is not the year after next. Within 7 \nyears--by 2002--we ought to be able to deliver a balanced budget. We \nare in peacetime. There is no war. There is relative prosperity. We \nought to be able to balance the budget in 7 years.\n  Severing the individual entitlement and turning the Medicaid program \nover to the States as a block grant causes me grave concerns, and could \nend up costing our health care system a lot more than the present \nprogram. A per capita cap on the Federal entitlement and much greater \nState flexibility are the appropriate solutions to the problems \nconfronting this program. I also question the wisdom of trying to find \nsuch a high level of savings from Medicaid.\n  Next, the Senate welfare reform bill was a sound package which won \nsignificant bipartisan support, and I hope the result which emerges \nfrom negotiations----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The 11 minutes of the Senator have expired.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. If I might have 1 more minute?\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. I yield the Senator an additional minute.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. I hope the result which emerges from negotiations on the \nwelfare part of the Balanced Budget Act will be closer to the Senate \nbill. The conference agreement appears to depart significantly from the \nSenate bill in areas such as foster care and children's Supplemental \nSecurity Income, for example. In addition, it is unreasonably \nrestrictive with respect to the treatment of legal immigrants, which I \nfind quite troubling and unacceptable.\n  We should bite the bullet and correct the Consumer Price Index, which \nis a measure of inflation used to compute cost-of-living adjustments \nfor Social Security benefits, as well as to conform Federal tax \nbrackets with inflationary changes. There is growing bipartisan \nconsensus within Congress, and among economists, that the CPI \noverstates inflation. Even a modest correction of five-tenths of 1 \npercent would reduce outlays by about $122 billion over 7 years, \naffecting only a $4 or $5 reduction in the increase the average \nbeneficiary would receive.\n  The approaches I have outlined will help the respective parties reach \nan agreement to balance the budget by providing the flexibility needed \nto reduce the reliance on savings from Medicaid and other programs \nserving the needy, particularly those serving poor children.\n  Mr. President, in conclusion, this legislation presents us with a \ntremendous opportunity to fulfill our responsibilities to put our \nfiscal house in order. I urge passage of this legislation so that we \ncan move on to direct negotiations with the White House toward a final \nbudget agreement. I thank the Chair and the manager.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from \nAlaska.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I do support this Balanced Budget Act of \n1995. I want to make a few comments about the continuing resolution \nthat is going to go to the President and its relationship to this bill.\n  I was deeply disturbed when the President vetoed the second \ncontinuing resolution. This will be the third one, because, you know, \nwe did have one from October 1 to November 13. I do hope the messages \nare getting through to the President. I have been heartened every \nmorning when I come into the office and review the logging-in of the \n\n[[Page S 17249]]\npublic opinion messages that come to my Alaska offices and here in \nWashington. I want to tell the Senate, of all the calls we have \nreceived during this period, about 15 percent of those calls agree with \nthe President; 4 percent rightly urge us to get together and settle \nthis problem; but over 80 percent of all the calls we received so far \ntell me to stay the course and balance the budget. They tell me to \ncontinue this fight that we have, to try to bring about some \nrestoration of, really, the fiscal solvency of the country and to \nrealign our laws so they make sense.\n  Alaskans, really, who have sent us here, tell us a balanced budget is \nworth fighting for. It is time we dealt with this issue. I just managed \nthe defense bill. Most people realize how large that defense bill is, \nand we were criticized on reporting it because it was so large.\n  I wonder how many people realize that the interest on the national \ndebt this year is the same as the amount of money we are spending for \nnational defense. The difficulty is, the debt is rising now at an \nastounding rate of $335,000 a minute, $20 million an hour, $482 million \na day. We have a deficit already standing at $176 billion, and it is \nprojected to remain roughly at that level through the end of the \ncentury--almost $200 billion a year through the end of the century.\n  Alaskans realize we cannot use the Federal credit card to get out of \nthis debt. We have to find some way to meet it. We also have to find \nsome way to provide the services that we need.\n  It will be the small States that are squeezed out if these interest \npayments continue to rise, and we know that. We rely on things like the \nCoast Guard and the FBI and FAA and so many groups that are involved in \nour livelihood, the fisheries and forestry programs of NOAA. All of \nthat is discretionary spending that is wiped out as interest rates go \nup. The reason we are committed to reducing this deficit and trying to \nbalance the budget is to preserve the kind of services that small \nStates need.\n  We could commit ourselves to just reducing the rate of growth to 3 \npercent across the board or 5 percent across the board. Instead, we \nhave a very complicated bill before us. It is a bill that makes sense. \nThe year 2002 makes a lot of sense to me. That is the first midterm \nelection following the election that will take place in the year 2000. \nIt gives the American public a chance to really react if Congress has \nfailed to meet its commitment.\n  I really have come to the floor today to say I just do not believe \nthe President can reject this continuing resolution that we have sent \nto him. In my judgment, he has campaigned for a 5-year balanced budget \nduring his campaign in 1992. He has accepted the 7-year period on \nseveral occasions. We are asking for no more than he himself has \npledged in the past to the American public. And in the State of the \nUnion Message, when he came before us in 1993, he urged us to use the \nCongressional Budget Office, not the political appointees of the Office \nof Management and Budget, to determine whether the bills that Congress \nsends him would meet the goals of balancing the budget.\n  I think that we need to have this bill which is before us passed. \nThere is no question about that. But I say to the President, I urge you \nto sign the continuing resolution. We are seeing the collision between \nthe two massive entities of our Federal Government--the executive \nbranch and the legislative branch--one under the control of one and the \nother under the control of the other, and there is no way for them to \nget together unless we have some time. This continuing resolution would \ngive us that time and keep the commitment not only to balanced budget \nby 2002, but to do so using sensible economics as delineated by the \nCongressional Budget Office.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. DORGAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, under a previous agreement I am allowed 15 \nminutes, as I understand it.\n  Mr. President, let me begin doing what someone recently alleged on \nthe other side of the aisle that no one has done.\n  Let me compliment the Republicans of the majority party. I think some \nof what they have done in this reconciliation bill makes a lot of \nsense. Some of the proposals are courageous proposals. Some of them \nmove us in the right direction.\n  I am not going to support this bill. I think there are some terrible \nideas in here as well. But let me say all of us have to work together \nto find common ground. Some of the proposals make a lot of sense. There \nare a good number of the proposals that I do support.\n  Mr. President, the debate is not about whether we balance the budget \nin 7 years. Frankly, if we could get the Federal Reserve Board to take \nits foot off the brake and get a little economic growth, we ought to be \nable to balance the budget in 5 years. The Federal Reserve Board cranks \nup interest rates because they say our economy is growing too fast. Let \nus get the Fed to get its foot off the brake, get some growth, and we \ncan do it before 7 years. That is not the debate, 7 years, 5 years, 8 \nyears.\n  Mr. President, the Senate is not in order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate will be in order.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, the budget reconciliation bill that we are \nnow debating should have come to the floor of the Senate by June 15. \nThat is what the law requires. Now we are 5 months later and we have a \nbill.\n  Of course, no one in this Chamber has read it--no one. Not one Member \nof the Senate, in my judgment, has read this entire bill. It just came \nyesterday. It was put in the Congressional Record in legislative \nlanguage of I guess probably 1900 pages long. But I wanted to explain \nto my colleagues some of what is in this bill. I think some of what I \nwill explain is not understood by anybody in the Senate. It is just \nthere.\n  We are told now that this bill is going to balance the budget, this \nplan must be adopted, this plan or no plan, this is the plan that will \nsave America, and this is the plan that will solve the fiscal policy \nproblems. Well, there are other ways to do the same thing and to do it \nthe right way. So let me go through some of the things that I think can \nbe changed and must be changed in this plan.\n  If you go through this plan in some detail, what you will see is the \nchoices that are made on spending cuts and the choices that are made on \ntax cuts seem always to be overweighed in terms of helping those who \nhave money with additional blessings of tax cuts and hurting those who \ndo not have much with the added burdens of budget cuts.\n  Let me show my colleagues something that I will bet no one in the \nSenate understands is there. In fact, let me do it by talking about \ncows, if the Senate will permit me to do that.\n  Section 1240, chapter 4, ``livestock and environmental assistance,'' \nwhich is a fancy way of saying--it is called LEA, ``livestock and \nenvironmental assistance.'' It includes something called ``manure \nmanagement.'' I will bet not many can visit with me about this. You do \nnot know it is in there--LEA, manure management.\n  Who gets the money under manure management? If you have up to 10,000 \nbeef cows, or a big herd, you are eligible for $50,000 in manure \nmanagement.\n  But what if you have a small herd? Not beef cows, but dairy cows. If \nyou have a small herd of dairy cows, and you have more than 55, you are \neligible for zero. Big herd of cows, you get $50,000 for manure \nmanagement. But a cow with spots, 56 of them, zero.\n  Look, this is a cow that wakes up at 5 in the morning and offers \nherself to give milk. This is a working cow.\n  With these cows, if you have 10,000 and they are in a feed lot, they \nsit around, eat all day and belch a lot. They do not shift much. So you \nhave a big herd, small herd; big interests, little interests; big \nfolks, little folks.\n  The entire bill does exactly what it does to cows. Tax cuts? The big \ninterests can smile. They get a lot. Little guys, little folks? There \nis not much there. Spending cuts? The little folks, they bear the \nburden. Big folks, no problem.\n  I have not had an opportunity to have the analysts look at this, but \nthey were able to look at the Senate's version of this bill, and here \nis what they said. And let me talk about this in terms of people, \nbecause that's what our country is all about.\n  Let us take a roomful of people, just a roomful the size of my \nhometown of 400 people, and set up chairs so they are all seated. You \nsay, ``By the way, let's figure out who in here has what money. Let's \ntake the 20 percent in \n\n[[Page S 17250]]\nhere with the lowest income, and you all move your chairs over to this \nside of the room.'' So we have all of you with the lowest income, 20 \npercent of you sitting over there. Now we are going to tell you about \nyour spending cuts. The folks with the 20 percent of the lowest incomes \nin this room, we will give you 80 percent of the burden of the spending \ncuts.\n  The news is not all bad, however. You folks with the 20 percent of \nthe highest incomes, move your chairs over to this side of the room \nbecause we have some awfully good news for you. We are going to cut \ntaxes, and you folks, you 20 percent that have the highest incomes in \nthis room, you get 80 percent of the tax cuts.\n  Let me repeat that. Under this bill, the 20 percent with the least \nincome get hit with 80 percent of the burden of the budget cuts or \nspending cuts. And the 20 percent with the highest incomes get 80 \npercent of the rewards of the tax cuts.\n  Some of us think that is not a fair way to apportion the burden of \nspending cuts and the blessings of tax cuts.\n  Let me talk about some other provisions that are in this bill. I will \nbet there are not 1 or 2 percent of the Senate who understand what they \nare. A couple of people put them in here, so they probably know.\n  Go to page H 12680 of the Record, which is where this bill was placed \nlast evening, and you find ``Repeal of inclusion of certain earnings \ninvested in excess passive assets.'' It reads, ``Paragraph 1 of section \n951(a) relating to amounts included in gross income of U.S. \nshareholders'' et cetera, ``Repeal of inclusion amount, Section 956(a) \nis repealed.''\n  What does that mean? I will bet there is not anyone on the floor who \nknows what that means. Not one person, I will bet, knows what that \nmeans.\n  I will tell you what it means, Mr. President. It means several \nhundreds of millions of dollars is given to the largest corporations \naround, who move their jobs overseas, earn income overseas, and under \ntoday's law must repatriate that income and pay taxes on it to this \ncountry.\n  But this bill on this page says we are of a different mind. We would \nlike in this bill to put a bow and some wrapping and a little package \nwhich we want to give those companies to encourage them to continue to \nkeep their jobs outside of this country--several hundred millions of \ndollars in a tax cut to encourage companies to stay out of this country \nwith their jobs. That is one.\n  How about page 12638, ``corporate alternative minimum tax reform\"? \nNot many will know what this means, except in the old days you would \nread a story that said XYZ corporation made $2 billion in income and \npaid zero in income taxes. So the Congress said that is not very fair. \nSo let us have an alternative minimum tax so that we do not have to \nread stories like that.\n  The House of Representatives wanted to repeal this alternative \nminimum tax completely. This conference report agreement would in \neffect repeal the alternative minimum tax with respect to depreciation.\n  What does that mean? It means 2,000 corporations in America will get \na $7 million tax cut each, on average--$7 million apiece for 2,000 \ncorporations buried on page 12638.\n  Is this what we are supposed to vote for? If we do not vote for this, \nare we somehow thickheaded? Or is this a gift?\n  Is this one of those special little prizes like the ones that go to \nthe big herd for manure management, one of those little prizes that \ngoes to the big interests that we are not supposed to see and we are \nnot supposed to debate?\n  Maybe this would come to the floor under normal circumstances and we \ncould debate the wisdom of such a policy at a time when we say to \n55,000 kids on Head Start: We do not have enough money for you. You are \ngoing to get kicked off the Head Start program; you kids going to \ncollege, you are going to pay more to go to college. We do not have \nenough money for student financial aid; you folks on Medicare pay more \nand get less for your health care; you people on Medicaid, we will \nblock grant that money to the States and maybe they will have money for \nyour health care, or maybe not.\n  But we say we have plenty of money to give a tax break to companies \nthat move their jobs overseas, and we have plenty of money to virtually \nrepeal the alternative minimum tax.\n  Some of us think that is not a priority that makes much sense.\n  Mr. President, how much time is remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Frist). About 5 minutes.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, yesterday, I spoke in the Chamber about \npriorities and choices. Let me in the middle of my remarks again \ncompliment the Republicans, the majority party. Their desire for a \nbalanced budget is commendable. I compliment them genuinely for it. The \ndesire ought to be universally shared on this floor.\n  The question of how you achieve that goal, the choices and the \npriorities you make, are important. They are important to a lot of \npeople.\n  I was in the Chamber yesterday talking about a little program called \nStar Schools, a tiny little program. It tries to create Star Schools in \nmath and sciences, at an annual cost of $25 million. This bill would \ncut Star Schools by 40 percent--40 percent in a tiny little program.\n  There's another program called star wars. That one is increased 100 \npercent. The majority's priority is star wars, which is not ordered, \nnot needed, not wanted. In the defense spending bill they boosted the \nPentagon's star wars program by 100 percent. Supposedly we have plenty \nof money, hundreds of millions of dollars, for that program because the \nsky is the limit. We are all loaded when it comes to the star wars \nprogram, but a 40 percent cut in a tiny program called Star Schools.\n  Nowhere is there a better example of warped priorities, in my \njudgment.\n  Tax cuts. I would like to see tax cuts for every American, but I \nwould say this. I offered an amendment in this Chamber saying let us at \nleast limit the tax cuts to those who make $250,000 a year or less and \nuse the savings from that limitation to reduce the hit on Medicare. Of \ncourse, that did not pass. Everybody here knows that every dollar of \ntax cut in this bill is borrowed. No one can deny that. The facts \ndemonstrate it. Every single dollar that is given in a tax cut is going \nto be borrowed. Every dollar of tax cuts will increase the Federal debt \nby a dollar.\n  Balanced budget. We are told this is the balanced budget. Well, \nagain, let me commend the Republicans because I think there needs to be \na greater and more energetic effort to try to balance the budget, but \nthis budget is not balanced.\n  The Director of the Congressional Budget Office says it is not a \nbalanced budget. It will have a $108 billion deficit in the year 2002. \nI can read the letter if you want. She wrote it on October 19.\n  You can call it a balanced budget if you misuse $110 billion in \nSocial Security funds in the year 2002, but, of course, that would be \ndishonest, and it would also violate the law.\n  This is not a balanced budget. It has a $108 billion deficit in 2002. \nIn fact, the very budget bill that was brought to the floor that was \ndescribed as the Balanced Budget Act has on page 3 under the category \n``Deficits,'' $108 billion in deficits in the year 2002. So it is not a \nbalanced budget.\n  We are not talking about the facts when people assert that it is a \nbalanced budget.\n  There are many ways to create a balanced budget. There are many \ncompeting interests in this country. There are almost unlimited needs, \nand there are limited resources. We would do this country a favor in my \njudgment by creating a fiscal policy that balances the budget the right \nway. As we do it, let us still continue to invest in the things that \nmake America great; let us continue to make our promises.\n  What makes America great? Investment in education and investment in \nour children advance this country's economic interests.\n  You have all heard the admonition: if you are worried about a year, \nplant rice; if you are worried about 10 years, plant some trees; if you \nare worried about a century, educate your children. Education advances \nthis country's interests. That is an investment. We do this country no \nfavor by deciding that the way to balance the Federal budget is cut \neducation and build star wars. The choices, it seems to me, are \ndifficult, but they are not choices in which we have to reach the wrong \nresult time after time after time. \n\n[[Page S 17251]]\n\n  There are many things, as I said when I started, in this proposal for \nwhich we should commend the Republicans, but there can be a much better \napproach to balancing the budget, fairer to all Americans if we could \nget together and understand the consequences of these choices on all of \nthe interests, big interests and little interests, big folks and little \nfolks and all Americans.\n  I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, at this time I would yield 10 minutes to \nthe Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, at the close of Tuesday's first budget \nmeeting with White House officials, I expressed to Chief of Staff Leon \nPanetta and Treasury Secretary Rubin my disappointment with their \ninflexible posture.\n  I told Mr. Panetta, and these are my exact words:\n\n       Don't assume the President isn't going to change his \n     position. He's changed his mind before.\n\n  Mr. Panetta did not respond and just walked off.\n  It was suggested to me that this may have been taken as a slap at or \ninsult to the President.\n  Let me assure you that I meant no malice, nor did I intend it as a \npartisan swipe at the President.\n  I was simply making a statement of fact.\n  And the fact is, the President changes his mind quite frequently.\n  And if the President refuses to negotiate in person with \ncongressional leaders, then those he sends must fully appreciate the \nfact that the President changes his mind a lot and that they as White \nHouse negotiators must be more flexible and open-minded.\n  The fact that the President changes his mind frequently may not be \nwell known by the public at large, but it is something that those of us \nwho work with him know very well.\n  The House Appropriations ranking Democrat, Congressman David Obey \nunderstands this.\n  In June Mr. Obey told the Associated Press:\n\n       I think most of us learned sometime ago that if you don't \n     like the President's position on a particular issue, you \n     simply need to wait a few weeks.\n\n  Again, that was an observation, a simple statement of fact, from a \nDemocratic congressional leader, that President Clinton changes his \nmind quite frequently.\n  President Clinton has changed his mind frequently on the question of \na balanced budget. On January 8, President Clinton promised to \n``present a 5-year plan to balance the budget.''\n  On May 20, he said he thought balancing the budget ``clearly can be \ndone in less than 10 years.'' So you see, he changed his mind again.\n  He changed his mind again on June 13, when he said, ``It took decades \nto run up this deficit; it's going to take a decade to wipe it out * * \n*.''\n  On October 19, President Clinton changed his mind again about \nbalancing the budget. He stated ``Well, I think we could reach it in \nseven years * * *''\n  So you see, Mr. President, my point to Mr. Panetta was that if he and \nthe other White House negotiators would be a bit more flexible, we \ncould quickly resolve this impasse that has shut down the Government.\n  I am sure Mr. Panetta is persuasive enough to convince the President \nto change his mind again * * * to do the right thing by committing to \nsupporting a CBO certified? Well, CBO has long been recognized as the \nreliable, unbiased, nonpartisan budget scorer.\n  Unfortunately, on this point, President Clinton has also changed his \nmind again.\n  In 1993, President Clinton touted CBO as the independent and more \naccurate budget scorer.\n  But then he changed his mind. He now is trying to convince Americans \nthat OMB, which is controlled by President Clinton, is the reliable, \nunbiased, and nonpartisan budget scorer.\n  President Clinton offered what he claimed was a 10-year balanced \nbudget plan that was cooked up by the OMB that he controls.\n  Even the chairman of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, \nSenator Bob Kerrey, criticized the President's so-called 10-year \nbalanced budget plan by stating\n\n       They cooked the numbers . . . He needs to get back to the \n     CBO numbers.\n\n  And, of course, as we all know, CBO's analysis exposes the fact that \nthe President's budget does not balance, not in 5 years, 7 years, 10 \nyears or ever.\n  Instead, CBO shows that it would compound the burden of our children \nand grandchildren by increasing the deficit to the tune of over $200 \nbillion each of those 10 years.\n  This is why President Clinton's budget was defeated in the Senate by \na vote of 96 to 0. Not one Democrat voted for President Clinton's \nbudget, not one Republican.\n  President Clinton has changed his mind on taxes. He campaigned \npromising a large tax cut.\n  Once elected President, he changed his mind. He instead pushed for \nand signed into law the largest tax increase in our Nation's history--\n$251 billion. It was a tax increase that hit our elderly and young \npeople alike.\n  Recently, he changed his mind again about his 1993 tax increase. He \ntold people in Houston that, and I quote:\n\n       Probably there are people in this room still mad at me at \n     that budget because you think I raised your taxes too much. \n     It might surprise you to know that I think I raised them too \n     much, too.\n\n  I do not suppose it is any more than a mere coincidence that he had \nthat particular change of mind during his Presidential campaign \nfundraiser in Texas.\n  President Clinton has changed his mind on Medicare spending a good \nnumber of times as well.\n  At the AARP Presidential Forum in 1993, President Clinton proposed to \nrestrain the growth of Medicare spending to two times the rate of \ninflation. He said, and I quote:\n\n       Today. . . . Medicare (is) going up at three times the rate \n     of inflation. We propose to let it go up at two times the \n     rate of inflation. That is not a Medicare--cut . . .\n\n  Mr. President, guess what? President Clinton has changed his mind \nagain--on two different counts here.\n  The Republican plan to save Medicare allows Medicare spending to go \nup--now listen carefully--two times the rate of inflation.\n  That is exactly what President Clinton proposed in 1993, but now he \nattacks Republicans for proposing the same.\n  Furthermore, whereas in 1993 he argued before AARP that doing this \nwas not a cut, now that the Republicans are recommending this, \nPresident Clinton says that it is a cut.\n  Mr. President, we could go on and on and on, if we attempted to list \nevery time President Clinton changed his mind, but I will not suffer my \ncolleagues through such an ordeal.\n  But the point should be clear to White House negotiators such as Mr. \nPanetta, that the President does change his mind often, and thus, they \nshould not be so closed-minded and entrenched in our negotiations.\n  Almost everything we Republicans and Americans want, and that \nremarkably has led to this unfortunate juncture, the President has at \none time or another, has said that he supports as well.\n  There is no justified reason for him to disagree with us now.\n  He said we could balance the budget in 7 years, so let us do it.\n  If he can come up with a plan to do it in 5 years as he said he \nwould, then let us consider that instead.\n  He said CBO is the most reliable budget scorer, so let us use their \nnumbers, instead of those rosy numbers cooked up by his OMB.\n  He said he wanted to restrain the growth of Medicare spending to two \ntimes inflation like we Republicans are currently proposing, so let us \ndo it.\n  He promised Americans a major tax cut, so he should join us \nRepublicans and just do it.\n  It is time President Clinton quit listening to his Democrat campaign \nconsultants who brag about subscribing to terror to make people hate, \nand start listening to some sound advice that is good for the country, \nclass warfare and generational/warfare tactics.\n  Mr. President, it is time to do the right thing.\n  There is no reason President Clinton cannot change his mind one more \ntime--one more time to do what is right.\n  As the ad campaign says, ``Just Do It.''\n\n[[Page S 17252]]\n\n  President Clinton, Just Do It.\n  I yield the floor, and I reserve the remainder of my time for the \nrest of the speakers.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. I yield 10 minutes to the Senator from Oklahoma.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. NICKLES. First, Mr. President, I would like to compliment my \ncolleague and friend from Iowa, Senator Grassley, for an excellent \nspeech. Also, I would like to compliment Senator Domenici for his \nleadership in bringing this budget package to the floor, as well as \nSenator Dole and Senator Roth, and Senator Abraham, who is managing the \nfloor, and I think doing an exceptional job.\n  Mr. President, in my opinion, this is probably the most important \nvote that we will cast in my 15 years in the Senate. We had historic \nvotes during President Reagan's term and President Bush's. But we \nreally never really had a vote to balance the budget. We never had a \nvote that would enact into law changes necessary to balance the budget.\n  Tonight we are going to have that vote. And I understand that our \ncolleagues on the Democrat side of the aisle and the President will not \nsupport us. I think that is unfortunate. I hope that after this vote \nmaybe they will work with us to enact a balanced budget.\n  For the first time in history, we are going to have the courage to do \nwhat is right and actually balance the budget. Such action by Congress \nhas not happened in decades. You would have to go back to 1969 to find \nthe last time we balanced the budget.\n  I think it is important, too, that we use facts. I have several \ncharts I am going to put in the Record to back up some of the comments \nI am going to make.\n  One, I want to refute some of the statements that President Clinton \nhas made. He said, his 1993 budget reduced deficits by $500 billion. I \nheard him say that as recently as yesterday.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \na chart that shows the CBO baseline in January 1993, which had very \nhigh deficit projections, and the CBO baseline in August of 1995, which \nhad significantly lower deficits. This chart shows why those deficits \nare lower. I ask unanimous consent to have that chart and others \nprinted in the Record at this time.\n  There being no objection, the charts were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                              SOURCE OF DEFICIT DECLINE SINCE PRESIDENT CLINTON TOOK OFFICE                                             \n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                                                       Clinton term                          Out Years                  \n                                                                     ------------------------------------------------------------------------           \n                                                                           103d Congress          104th Congress          105th Congress         Total  \n                                                                     ------------------------------------------------------------------------           \n                                                                         1993        1994        1995        1996        1997        1998               \n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nCBO deficit baseline (January 1993).................................        310         291         284         287         319         357       1,848 \nTax and fee increases...............................................          0         (28)        (47)        (54)        (65)        (64)       (259)\nSpending increase/(cuts)............................................          4           9           3         (18)        (39)        (56)        (98)\nTechnical, economic, and debt service...............................

                           \n\n\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, what this chart shows is that the \nPresident did not make any spending cuts in his first 3 years \nwhatsoever, none. He did have significant tax increases, actually, the \nlargest tax increase in history. But the bulk of the so-called deficit \nreduction was technical changes, economic changes and debt service \nsavings, in other words, reductions that were not the result of his \npolicies.\n  But I wanted to note, of that $500 billion in so-called deficit \nreduction, in the first 3 years there were no spending cuts. Actually, \nspending increased over the CBO baseline $4 billion in 1993, $9 billion \nin 1994, $3 billion in 1995. So now, those facts are in the record. \nAlso, we heard the President say in one press conference that he wanted \nto balance the budget. He mentioned the word ``balanced budget'' 16 \ntimes in a recent short press conference. As a matter of fact, he has \nmentioned several times about his desire to balance the budget.\n  As a candidate in 1992, he said that he would submit a 5-year plan to \nbalance the budget. On May 20 of this year he said, ``I think balancing \nthe budget clearly can be done in less than 10 years.'' In June he \nsaid, ``It's going to take a decade to wipe out the deficit.'' In \nOctober he said that ``We could reach it,'' balancing the budget, ``in \n7 years.'' Also, in October he said, ``We can do it in 8 years.'' Also, \nin October he said, ``We can do it in 9 years.'' The President has been \nall over the lot on how long it would take to balance the budget.\n  The point is, Republicans actually have a bill--not a statement--we \nhave a bill before us which, if enacted, will balance the budget in 7 \nyears. I think that is real. It is significant. It is substantive.\n  Now, I heard some of my colleagues on the floor say, ``Well, if we \nenact your plan, it is going to devastate Medicare, it is going to \ndevastate Medicaid, and it is going to give all these wealthy people \nbig tax cuts. They say that we are going to cut these programs and \ntransfer more wealth to the wealthy.''\n  That is totally, completely, irrefutably false. And I will put the \nfacts in the record to prove it. But first, I want to talk about these \ncuts for a second.\n  For example, Medicare spending rises under our plan. This year it is \n$178 billion. In the year 2002, it is $293 billion. That happens to be \na 65-percent increase. Not a decrease, an increase. Medicaid spending \nrises from $89 billion to $122 billion. That is a 37-percent increase. \nOverall mandatory spending increases from $739 billion to over $1.93 \ntrillion. That is a 48-percent increase.\n  Maybe we did not cut spending enough. Those are big increases. Today \nwe are spending about $1.5 trillion. In 7 years, we are going to spend \n$1.85 trillion. In other words, spending increases every single year.\n  Do we slow the growth of spending down? Yes. Do we make these \nprograms grow at more affordable rates? Yes. Do we offer some tax \nrelief for middle-income Americans? Yes. Should we make apologies for \nthat? I say definitely not.\n  I think this package that we have put together is a fair package. I \nthink it is a good package.\n  Also, I have to say, Mr. President, we have to compare it to the \nPresident's budget. What has he submitted as his plan? In January 1995, \nhe submitted a budget that never came into balance. His budget actually \nhad deficits rising substantially.\n  He submitted a revised budget in June. According to CBO, the deficits \nin his new budget go up as well. Let me give you his deficit figures. \nThis year, the deficit was $164 billion. Under the President's plan, it \nrises to $210 billion in the year 2002.\n  Our budget has a surplus in the year 2002 of $4 billion. We actually \nbalance the budget in 7 years. The President's budget deficits continue \nto escalate to over $200 billion for as far as the eye can see. That is \nthe difference in our visions for the future.\n  Those are the only two proposals on the table. I might mention, the \nPresident's proposal was about 20 pages on a fax machine. Not a \nsignificant, substantive document. It was more a theoretical document. \nWe have a real budget that says if we curb these entitlement programs \nand make other spending cuts, we are going to have a balanced budget.\n  Republicans are going to change budget laws. We did not balance the \nbudget under President Reagan, and I love President Reagan. We did not \ndo it under President Bush, and I think very highly of President Bush. \nBut we never had the votes or the courage to curtail the growth of \nentitlement programs.\n  Some of these programs are exploding in cost. Over the last several \nyears Medicaid grew at 28, 29, 30, 31 percent. The earned-income credit \ngrew from $2 billion in 1985 to $23 billion in 1994. That is an \nunbelievable growth rate, 11 times what it was just 9 years ago. In \nother words, we had a lot of entitlement programs just exploding in \ncost.\n  Now, for the first time, we are curtailing the growth of those \nprograms. Some people say we are slashing those programs. I take issue \nwith that.\n  Medicare is probably the one issue that has been demagogued by \nopponents of this package more than any other. I mention, in our \nbudget, that in 1995 in Medicare we spend $178 billion. By the year \n2002, we spend $293 billion. That is a 65 percent increase.\n  Mr. President, what is shocking--I hope my colleagues on the other \nside of the aisle will look at this chart--as I compare the spending \nthat we propose in Medicare every year to the spending proposed in the \nPresident's June budget--and I find very, very little difference. Under \nour proposal, Medicare grows at an annual rate of 7.4 percent. Under \nthe President's proposal, Medicare grows at 7.5 percent.\n  Under our proposal, for which we are being lambasted so much--I heard \npeople say we are killing Medicare and we are being unfair to senior \ncitizens--actually, our budget proposes spending more in the year 2002 \nthan the President's proposal in Medicare. That is kind of surprising.\n\n  My point is, these cuts are not draconian, they are not drastic. \nSomebody said, ``The Republicans are trying to cut Medicare $270 \nbillion and the President is only trying to cut $124 billion.''\n  The President uses different economic assumptions. He assumes the \nhealth care costs are going to grow at a slower rate than we do on the \nRepublican side.\n  Our point is that we are using the Congressional Budget Office. I \nmight mention, President Clinton originally said that he would use the \nCongressional Budget Office. It does make a difference. Over a 10-year \nspan, the President's budget comes to balance by assuming a more \nfavorable economic situation that equals $475 billion more that he \nwould like to spend.\n  But the President, in his State of the Union Address in 1993, \nexplained to Congress why he used CBO numbers to score his budget \nproposal. He said:\n\n       I did this so that we could argue about priorities with the \n     same set of numbers. I did this so that no one could say I \n     was estimating my way out of this difficulty. I did this \n     because if we can agree together on the most prudent revenues \n     we're likely to get if the recovery stays and we do the right \n     things economically, then it will turn out better for the \n     American people than we say.\n\n  The President was right: We should use the same numbers. But \nunfortunately, now he is trying to estimate his way out of difficulty.\n  We need to balance the budget. We need to make difficult decisions. \nIt is not always easy to do, but I think we have a very balanced \nproposal, one that does not inflict undue paid. Somebody said, ``Oh, \nlook at all the pain.'' I do not see pain in this proposal. I see us \ndoing what we should do. \n\n[[Page S 17255]]\n\n  Let us look at Medicare. My Democrat colleagues on the Finance \nCommittee offered to cut Medicare part A, the hospital portion, by $89 \nbillion. They offered that as an amendment on the floor too. So we \nbasically agree on the amount of cuts on hospitals.\n  Then they said, ``Republicans are trying to raise premiums on part B \nbeneficiaries, the doctor portion.'' What do we really do? We keep the \npremium rate at 31.5 percent of program costs. That is what the \nbeneficiaries pay today. That is fair; that is reasonable. The program \nstarted out at 50 percent. Keeping it at 31.5 percent, I think, is \nfair.\n  Do premium costs increase? Yes, but they increase under the \nPresident's proposal too. As a matter of fact, the President's increase \nin part B premiums follow right along with ours. There is only, I \nthink, a $5 difference in the year 2002 in premiums. What he did not \ntell people is, ``Present law goes down to 25 percent, and I am going \nto take credit for that and really lambaste and demagog the \nRepublicans.''\n  The fact is, keeping premium levels at 31.5 percent is fair. We also \nsay wealthier people should pay a little more. We should not be asking \neverybody who is making $20,000 to be subsidizing wealthier people on \ntheir part B premium.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I ask unanimous consent for 2 additional minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. NICKLES. We also made some tax changes that are fair to American \nfamilies. I have heard a lot of colleagues say, ``Well, that's not \nfair.'' The heck it is not. We are giving tax relief to individuals and \nfamilies who have kids, a $500 per child tax credit. Somebody says that \ndoes not mean very much. Well, I disagree. I only have one child now \nwho would qualify, because they have to be under the age of 18. I used \nto have four kids who would qualify.\n  A lot of American families need help. Four kids is $2,000 in tax \nrelief. That is targeted toward the American family. That will help. An \nindividual or couple who has two kids gets $1,000. That is $1,000 that \nthey get to spend on themselves instead of sending it to Washington, \nDC, to have politicians spend on a multitude of items.\n  It is the idea that they can choose. They may want to spend it on \neducation or a home or transportation or to buy food or pay utilities. \nWe want to let families make that decision, not the Government.\n  We have targeted the bulk of tax relief to American families. We did \nit with the inheritance tax; we did it with the child credit; we did it \nwith IRA savings accounts; we did it with medical savings accounts.\n  Mr. President, I think this is a balanced package, it is a good \npackage, and it is the only package we have before us that will balance \nthe budget.\n  We said we were going to do it. We are going to do it. I think what \nwe are doing is vitally important. I thank the manager of the bill and \nI yield the floor.\n  Mr. EXON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. DeWine). The Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, I yield 15 minutes to the Senator from \nMassachusetts.\n  Mr. KERRY. I thank the Chair and the distinguished minority manager \nof the bill.\n  Mr. President, I just heard one speaker say that this will be the \nmost important vote in the Senate in 15 years. I respectfully disagree. \nI think the most important vote in the Senate in 15 years will be the \nvote when we return with a reconciliation package that has been \nnegotiated and which fairly reflects the administration, the minority \nand the majority in the Senate, as an expression of all of our desires \nto balance the budget. That will be the most important vote. But I do \nnot want to quibble or deny the notion that this is not an important \nstatement.\n  I would like to say that, from at least this Senator's perspective, \nour colleagues on the other side of the aisle deserve credit. I think \nit is appropriate for us to talk more honestly about what is at stake \nhere and, perhaps, depart from some of the partisan rhetoric, though it \nis hard because of the circumstances.\n  The fact is that the majority is proving what many of us said as we \nopposed the balanced budget amendment. What we said was that we do not \nneed an amendment, we simply need legislators with the courage to \nbalance the budget. And indeed, the Republicans have picked up that \nchallenge and they deserve credit for having returned to the floor with \na budget that, in their view, expresses their values and their \ndirection for the country.\n  So they are offering a balanced budget. Regrettably, their choices, \nwhich are more unilateral than most of us would have hoped we would \narrive at because in effect it represents exclusively the Republican \nHouse and Republican Senate to the exclusion of most of the efforts of \nthe rest of us. Theirs is a statement of values. Their budget sets \nforth the Gingrich-Republican view of how America ought to be. And the \nfact that some of us oppose that view does not mean that we oppose \ncoming to the floor and voting for a balanced budget.\n  I will vote ``no'' on this view of America, with the hopes that after \nthe President has vetoed it we will return with a more compromised, \ncentrist, and hopefully more diverse, shared view of where this country \nshould go in this important statement of a budget.\n  It is my hope that many of us who want to balance the budget and do \nit responsibly, with a fair reflection of the values of this country, \nwill have an opportunity to do so after the real negotiations take \nplace.\n  Mr. President, I have already voted for a balanced budget. It was the \nso-called Conrad plan. It was a plan that I did not agree with every \npart of, but I think it was far more fair than the plan or any other \nplan that we have had on the floor. It was a plan that gave tax breaks \nto middle-class working families. It closed tax loopholes, reduced \ncorporate welfare. But instead, in this plan we are now confronted \nwith, contrary to the fairness that we tried to achieve previously, the \nRepublicans are raising $32 billion worth of taxes from Americans \nearning less than $30,000 a year.\n  I voted for a balanced budget plan that was honest about the need to \ndo something about Medicare. I agree with my colleagues. There has been \na lot of heightened rhetoric about it. The truth is that we have to \nrestrain the growth on entitlements generally, and we have to retain \nthe growth particularly in Medicare and Medicaid the fastest-growing \nportions of the budget. I voted for a budget, Mr. President, that was \nfair in what it asked seniors to do in sharing that burden. It saved \nthe Medicare plan without cutting twice as much as we need to, twice as \nmuch as is currently reflected in this budget. I voted for a \ncommonsense reduction in Medicare to save the system. The Republicans \nare essentially, in order to give a tax cut, taking the heart out of \nMedicare with the $270 billion reduction.\n  I voted, Mr. President, for a balanced budget that would preserve \naccess to health care for those people with disabilities, for pregnant \nwomen, and for children. While we reduced--in our budget--Medicaid by \nabout $125 billion, the Republicans have come to the floor with a \nbudget that reduces it by $182 billion over 7 years.\n  I voted for a balanced budget that invested in our children's \neducation. It saved educational access, vital for job growth and \ncompetitiveness. But the Republicans now want to cut student loan \nprograms by more than $5 billion, at a time when it is harder and \nharder for average Americans to send their kids to college. They also \nare going to wind up taking 1.8 million kids off of student loan rolls, \nand reducing by 1,250 the number of colleges that can participate in a \ndirect lending plan. That is good for banks, Mr. President, but it is \nnot good for students or for our colleges.\n  I voted for a balanced budget that would feed hungry children in this \ncountry, and it added back more than half of the funds for food and for \nchildren. But instead the Republicans are going to slash $46 billion \nover the next 7 years that would leave literally millions of children \nhungry in this country.\n  I voted for a balanced budget that would honor the service of \nveterans, not leave them scot-free, because we did in our budget reduce \nveterans' payments by about $5 billion, but the Republicans want to \nrecklessly cut those \n\n[[Page S 17256]]\nprograms in a way that may close 35 of 170 hospitals, and certainly \nfive next year.\n  Mr. President, this budget process is the truest statement about any \nparty's priorities or any individual's sense of what is fair. The \nbottom line is that this budget is about people. With this Republican \nbudget tonight, they reverse some 60 years of a certainty that was \nbuilt into the fabric of the American political structure--a certainty \nthat our senior citizens would not grow old and be left with nothing--a \ncertainty that families would be part of a community and that we would \ncare for people, even if they were in the street, even if they were \nsuffering or in need of help.\n  I wonder whether this budget is really representative of what America \nhas become in 1995, because if it is, then I think this Senate will \nlong be remembered as the Senate that took away the good part of the \ncertainty of American life, not the bad part, not the part that we know \nwith respect to welfare and other programs has distorted values. I am \ntalking about the good part, the part that allowed people to lift \nthemselves up by their bootstraps, that allowed people in a nursing \nhome to not have to get rid of every cent they had in order to stay \nthere, the part that guaranteed that we are not going to suddenly have \nseniors strapped into wheelchairs again because nursing home standards \nare lifted. Those were certainties that we built into American life.\n  This budget takes away those certainties, Mr. President. With this \nbudget, thousands and thousands of women and children, our fellow \ncitizens, thousands of families, thousands of seniors, who are \nstruggling to pay for food or pay for health care, or simply meet the \nrent or save something for the future, they will be hurt. As my friend \nfrom North Dakota pointed out, they will be hurt in juxtaposition to \ncountless millions of people who do not need that help, who will be \nhelped.\n  This budget violates everybody's fundamental sense of fairness, Mr. \nPresident. And that is something that we ought to care about as we care \nabout the fabric of values and of life in this country.\n  There will, as a result of this budget, no longer be a certainty in \nAmerica that children will not go hungry. There will no longer be a \ncertainty that an elderly widow in a Massachusetts hospital will not \nlose everything that she has. There is no longer a certainty that their \nchildren, who are already struggling, getting more and more behind, \nwill be able to pay for her care without jeopardizing their future.\n  There is no certainty in this budget that American children will get \na better shot at a decent education or a better shot at a job, and \nthere is no certainty that a pregnant mother or a disabled veteran will \nget the helping hand that we have always promised.\n  There is not even the certainty that our drinking water will get \ncleaner or our wilderness will be protected or that toxic waste will be \ncleaned up or that we will hand down to our children a better country, \nMr. President.\n  I think the least we can do in a budget is express our responsibility \nto protect the certainties that those who came to this floor before us \nfought for.\n  I can only say to my colleagues who tell us this budget is a sure \nthing that in the words of Robert Burns, ``There is no such uncertainty \nas a sure thing.''\n  This budget will create uncertainties, uncertainties with respect to \nthe environment, uncertainties with respect to people's capacity to \nstrive to make the best of their own opportunities to get an education, \nto try to touch the new marketplace.\n  Mr. President, there is an enormous giveaway to mining companies in \nthis budget. There is oil drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife \nRefuge. There are water subsidies to America's largest agricultural \ncorporations. There is a royalty exemption from oil leases in the Gulf \nof Mexico. There are lots of little goodies in this budget which do not \nspeak to the issue of fairness in this country.\n  I might just say, Mr. President, with respect to some of the most \nimportant things we hear talked about on the Senate floor, values with \nrespect to children, this budget is not friendly.\n  We have heard a lot of talk about the number of children who are born \nout of wedlock, the number of kids who desperately need an opportunity \nthrough Head Start, or who desperately need a hot lunch. This budget \ncreates an enormous shift of wealth from those who are at the lower end \nstruggling to make ends meet and working families, not people on \nwelfare but working families, and it takes that wealth from those \nstruggling and gives it to people at the upper end who do not need it.\n  Mr. President, in the name of fairness, I am pleased that the \nPresident has said he will veto this budget. The most important vote \nwill be the vote that occurs after we have the negotiations that will \ntake place in the next weeks, and I hope it will not take longer than \nweeks. It is my fervent plea in the course of that process more voices \nof America be heard and reflected in our budget.\n  Again, I say, Mr. President, there are many on this side of the aisle \nwho looked forward to the ability to be able to help shape that \nprocess. It is our hope we will join together around reasonable \nfigures, perhaps some combination of CBO or OMB--figures that are \nreasonably arrived at and reflect the future economic growth of this \ncountry, and that we will use those figures to come up with an \nintelligent budget that all of us can take to America as we ask people \nto share the sacrifices necessary to balance the budget.\n  It is my hope that day will come soon. That will be the most \nimportant vote in the U.S. Senate. I yield back my remaining time to \nthe Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, this is a critically important debate. It \nought to be informed, I think, by fact and reason and by law.\n  Mr. President, we have heard a lot of talk that what we have before \nus is a balanced budget. The fact is, the law says something different. \nThe law says we do not have a balanced budget before the Senate.\n  That is because if you look at subtitle C of Social Security, the \noff-budget status of Social Security trust funds, it makes very clear \nthat Social Security surpluses are not to be included in any \ncalculation of the deficit.\n  The only way the Republican plan achieves balance is to use every \npenny of Social Security surplus generated between now and the year \n2002 --$636 billion of Social Security surplus funds will be raided so \nthat the Republicans can claim their plan is balanced.\n  Mr. President, this is not just my view. This is, in fact, the \ncertification from the Congressional Budget Office. We have been \nthrough this debate before, and on October 20, Senator Dorgan and I \nasked the head of the CBO, if we follow the law, a law that 98 Senators \nvoted for, and excluded Social Security surpluses, what would the \ndeficit look like in 2002 under the Republican plan?\n  The head of the CBO responded by saying the deficit in 2002 under the \nplan presented would be $105 billion.\n  In the conference committee that number has grown. We now have a \ndeficit in the year 2002 under this plan, if we obey the law, of $111 \nbillion. I think it is important to make that point for the record.\n  This chart shows the looting of the Social Security trust fund that \nwill go on during this period, from 1996 to 2002. These are the yearly \ntotals that will be taken of Social Security surplus funds. This is the \ntotal over the 7-year period--$636 billion.\n  Mr. President, we have heard from the other side assertions that the \nDemocrats have no alternative balanced budget plan. It makes me wonder \nwhere some of our colleagues have been. We have had a series of \nalternatives offered on the floor of the Senate.\n  The one I was most deeply involved in was the Fair Share balanced \nbudget plan we offered during the budget resolution. It was an honest \nbalanced budget plan but with a substantially different set of \npriorities than those contained in the Republican plan.\n  Let me talk about some of the differences. The Fair Share Plan \nbalanced the budget, without counting Social Security surpluses, by the \nyear 2004--9 years without counting any Social Security surpluses. It \nproduces more deficit reduction in 2002 than the Republican plan.\n  In fact, the Fair Share Plan that 39 Democrats in this body voted for \nhad $100 billion more in deficit reduction than the Republican plan. \n\n[[Page S 17257]]\n\n  At the same time, it had a substantially different set of priorities \nthan the Republican balanced budget plan. The Democratic balanced \nbudget plan restored $100 billion of the $270 cut in Medicare.\n  I know many on the other side of the aisle have said they are not \ncutting Medicare. I ask them this simple question: If they are not \ncutting Medicare, how is it that they have achieved $270 billion of \nsavings from what current law provides in Medicare? How can it be, if \nthey have not cut anything, that they have saved $270 billion over the \nnext 7 years? Of course they have cut. They have cut in quality and \nservice what our seniors will receive through that program.\n  Some say, ``I hear the Republicans saying they are spending more \nmoney on Medicare.'' Yes, that is true. They are spending more money. \nOf course they are spending more money. There is 7 years of medical \ninflation that has to be covered. Medical inflation is growing at three \ntimes the rate of normal inflation.\n  In addition, there are 5 million new people who are going to be \neligible for Medicare during this 7-year period. So of course they have \nto spend more.\n  But the fact is, they are not spending as much more as would be \nrequired in order to provide the same level of quality and services as \nthe current program provides. That is why they have $270 billion of \nsavings out of the Medicare Program. But those savings are going to \nmean less quality, less service to seniors than the services and \nquality of service they receive now.\n  In addition, the draconian changes that the Republicans have proposed \nfor Medicare are going to mean we are going to have rural hospitals all \nacross America forced to close. In my own State, the hospital \nassociation tells me 26 of the 30 rural hospitals are going to negative \nmargins on their Medicare-eligible patients. Of course, most of their \npatients are Medicare eligible. That means many of those hospitals will \nbe forced to close. That is the harsh reality of what is being proposed \nhere.\n  Do we need to generate savings out of Medicare in order to balance \nthe budget over 7 years? Absolutely. But $270 billion of reductions is \ntoo much. It is draconian. It is extreme. It will have severe \nconsequences.\n  The plan that 39 Democrats voted for restored $100 billion of the \n$270 billion of cuts in the Republican plan. In addition, we restored \nabout $40 billion of the cuts to Medicaid. Let me just indicate, we now \nhave a new analysis from Consumers Union that indicates we are going to \nsee 12 million people lose their medical coverage because of the \nserious reductions to the Medicaid Program provided for in this \nRepublican plan.\n  Education? The plan that 39 Senate Democrats voted for did not cut \neducation. We did not have a dime of cuts in education because we \nbelieve education is the future. If there is one place that should not \nbe cut it is those funds that make it more possible for people to \ndevelop their full potential through education and all of the \nopportunities that education creates, not only for the individual but \nfor all of the rest of us who benefit from what people are able to \nachieve who have gotten as much education as they possibly can.\n  Nutrition and agriculture? We restored $24 billion in order to have \nless of a cut to food programs and to agriculture programs. Let me just \nsay with respect to agriculture, the Republican program is to indicate \nthey are going to kill all agriculture programs after 7 years. They \nhave now come forward and admitted what their plan really is. We will \nnot have an agriculture program after 7 years. They are destroying the \nfoundation of the agriculture programs of this country by ending the \nauthorization that exists in law that has been there since 1938.\n  Let me just say, the Republican plan for agriculture is not a plan \nfor American farmers. It is a plan for the French farmer. It is a plan \nfor the German farmer. It is a plan for the farmers of every country \nwith whom we compete, because that is who is going to benefit from the \nRepublican farm plan.\n  One of the ways we were able to have a balanced budget that 39 \nDemocrats voted for and to be able to restore some of the draconian \nspending cuts contained in the Republican plan, was to eliminate tax \ncuts. We did not have any tax cuts. Because under the Republican plan, \ndisproportionately those tax reductions go to the wealthiest among us.\n  I just do not think it makes much sense to say to somebody who is in \nthe top 1 percent of income earners in this country, you get a $10,000 \ntax reduction, but if you are somebody who is earning less than $30,000 \na year who qualifies for earned-income tax credit, you are going to get \na tax increase.\n  Mr. President, 7.7 million families in America under the Republican \nplan are going to get a tax increase. Those who are at the top of the \nincome ladder, the top 1 percent on average are going to get a $10,000 \ntax cut. I do not know how they justify it. It is not my idea of \ntargeted tax relief. But that is in this plan.\n  Finally, in the Fair Share plan that 39 Senate Democrats voted for, \nwe asked the wealthiest among us to participate in this battle to \nreduce the budget deficit. We asked them to curtail the growth of the \ntax entitlements that they primarily benefit from. If we are going to \nreduce the growth of the spending entitlements, and we must, then why \nnot reduce the growth of the tax entitlements, $4 trillion of tax \nentitlements? It is the biggest single pot of money in the whole \nFederal budget.\n\n  This chart shows entitlement spending from 1996 to 2002. Tax \nentitlements, $4 trillion--much bigger than the next biggest \nentitlement, Social Security. That is nearly $3 trillion over the next \n7 years. Medicare is $2 trillion over the next 7 years, and Medicaid is \nabout $1 trillion. But the biggest one of all is the tax entitlements, \nthe tax preferences, the tax loopholes.\n  We say if we are going to reduce the rate of growth of the spending \nentitlements, let us reduce the rate of growth of the tax entitlements \nas well. Let us reduce that growth to inflation plus 1 percent.\n  Our friends on the other side say there is no tax entitlement, no tax \npreference, no tax loophole that we want to close. We want to keep them \nall. We think they are all valid. We think they are all essential.\n  We, on our side of the aisle, do not.\n  Mr. President, these are critical issues that will be decided for the \nfirst time tonight. But I think we should all remember, the President \nis going to veto this bill, as he should, and then the real debate is \ngoing to begin. Then the real discussion, the real negotiation will \nstart.\n  One of the key issues will be, should we really be providing a tax \ncut when we are adding $1.8 trillion to the debt under this Republican \nplan? That is what is going to happen. We have $5 trillion of debt now. \nUnder this plan, we are going to add another $1.8 trillion, which means \nevery penny of this tax cut is going to have to be borrowed money.\n  Does that make sense to anybody in this country? We have to borrow \nmoney in order to give a tax cut? Give a tax cut when we are adding \n$1.8 trillion to the debt? I thought the idea was to eliminate the \ngrowth of the debt, to reduce the growth of the debt. Why do we add to \nit?\n  Mr. President, I think one of the things we have to start focusing on \nis what is happening to the distribution of wealth in America, because \nwhat we have seen is a dramatic change. In 1969, the top 1 percent of \nhouseholds in America held about 20 percent of the wealth. In 1979, the \ntop 1 percent had increased their share of the wealth of America to 30 \npercent. In 1989, the top 1 percent of the income earners in this \ncountry held nearly 40 percent of the wealth of this country.\n  The other side accuses those of us on this side of wanting to \nredistribute the wealth. Let me just say, our friends on the other side \nof the aisle are the champions at wealth redistribution. But their idea \nis to redistribute the wealth upwards, upwards in our society. The \nhistory of that kind of concentration of wealth is very clear. It leads \nto political instability and it leads to trouble. We should not allow \nthat to occur.\n  U.S. News, in this quote from David Gergen, says:\n\n       U.S. News & World Report reported last week . . . that the \n     lowest 20 percent of the population would lose more income \n     under these spending cuts than the rest of the population \n     combined. At the other end, the highest 20 percent would gain \n     more from the tax cuts than everyone else combined.\n\n  He goes on to say:\n\n\n[[Page S 17258]]\n\n       [N]o one disputes the basic contention that the burdens and \n     benefits are lopsided. In a nation divided dangerously into \n     haves and have-nots, this is neither wise nor justified.\n\n  Mr. President, David Gergen has it right, but he is not alone in this \nobservation.\n  I will share with you the final part of my presentation, the \nobservation of Kevin Phillips, Republican political analyst, who said:\n\n       If the budget deficit were really a national crisis instead \n     of a pretext for fiscal favoritism and finagling, we'd be \n     talking about shared sacrifice, with business, all industry \n     and the rich, people who have the big money, making the \n     biggest sacrifice. Instead, it's the senior citizens, it's \n     the poor, students, and ordinary Americans who'll see \n     programs they depend on gutted while business, finance, \n     and the richest 1 or 2 percent, far from making \n     sacrifices, actually get new benefits, and tax reductions.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair advises the Senator that his time \nhas expired.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I thank the Chair. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The distinguished Senator from Michigan is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I yield 7 minutes to the Senator from \nGeorgia.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. I thank the Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. President, if I might, I would like to pause for just a minute to \ncomment on this historic moment and the opportunity to vote for the \nfirst balanced budget concept in over three decades and to outline the \npredicament, or the situation, that has prompted these actions on the \npart of the majority in the 104th Congress.\n  The bipartisan Entitlement Commission reported to the Congress and \nthe President earlier this year that, without change, without \nmodification, the totality of all U.S. resources will be exhausted by \nbut five programs. Those five programs are Social Security, Medicare, \nMedicaid, Federal retirement, and the interest on our debt. And by the \nyear 2006, which is not long--less than 10 years--there will not be \nenough resources to debate many of these programs we are responsible \nfor in America. We will not be debating the School Lunch Program. There \nwill not be one.\n  Five programs take all U.S. revenues, and in but 10 years--Social \nSecurity, Medicare, Medicaid, Federal retirement, and just the interest \non our debt--and there is nothing left to fulfill the responsibilities \nof this great democracy to its own citizens and to the world.\n  The solution to avoid that predicament is to move to balanced \nbudgets. All America knows this. It just seems that people in \nWashington are late arriving at the conclusion.\n  These balanced budgets that have been fashioned by the Budget \nCommittee and the Finance Committee are absolutely mandatory to avert \nthe disaster that is but 10 years away. The balanced budget deals with \nall but one of these problems. It, obviously, by balancing itself, \nquits adding debt and, therefore, lowers the interest payments. It \nbegins to restructure Medicaid and send it to the States for more \nefficient management. It takes Medicare, which is destined to go \nbankrupt in but 6 years according to the President's own trustees, and \nrestructures it in a way to guarantee solvency for a quarter of a \ncentury.\n  What a relief that must be to all the beneficiaries of Medicare to \nunderstand that these changes will give them more choices, but, more \nimportantly, give them a program that is solvent for a quarter of a \ncentury.\n  It begins to deal with the subject of Federal retirement. And Social \nSecurity is not dealt with directly, but I would say indirectly it is, \nbecause it has engaged the Nation in the discussion of entitlements and \ntheir solvency and their future.\n  Mr. President, what are the benefits if the Nation seizes the \nresponsibility of managing its financial affairs? They are just \nstunning. The average family in America will see the interest payment \non its mortgage drop dramatically. It would save the average family \nwhich makes about $40,000 a year $1,000 a year on their mortgage. It \nwould save the average family $180 a year on the car payment interest \npayments. It will save the average family another $200 a year because \nof all the other debt that they carry. If the average family has two \nchildren, it will have $1,000 removed of tax liability.\n  The bottom line here, Mr. President, is that the average family in \nAmerica will have $2,000 to $3,000 of new disposable income in their \nhands instead of Washington's so that they can make choices about \neducation, housing, and the health of their own families.\n  I have mentioned Ozzie and Harriet more than once here. When Ozzie \nwas the quintessential family, he sent 2 cents of every dollar to \nWashington. If he were here today, he would be sending 24 cents of \nevery dollar to Washington. We have marginalized the average family \nbecause of the tax pressures and tax burden. The most important thing \nwe can do is lighten that financial burden on those families, give them \noptions, and give them the opportunity to deal with the responsibility.\n\n  As I have listened to the debate, my good friend, the Senator from \nNebraska, seems to feel that it is best for Ozzie to send the money \nhere, and for us to decide what is good or not for their family. Wrong. \nWrong. They want the opportunity to make the decisions about what is \nbest for their families.\n  Under this proposal, the families of 51 million American children, or \n28 million tax-paying families, are eligible for the $500 per child tax \ncut. Under this proposal, 3\\1/2\\ million families will have over $2.2 \nbillion in tax relief. Millions of American families will be taken off \nthe tax rolls altogether.\n  What is the President's response about balancing the budget? First \nand foremost, he opposed the balanced budget amendment. Secondarily, he \nsaid he would balance the budget in 5 years when he ran for President. \nThat is a long-forgotten promise. Then he said he would send us a \nbalanced budget in 10 years. And by everybody's estimate, that budget \nnever balances. And when it was put to a vote in this Senate, it failed \n100 to nothing. How much more discredited could a budget proposal be?\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor with this conclusion. This whole \nbattle is about balancing the budget. This new Congress wants to do it. \nThe President does not. America should tell the President now is the \ntime to balance our budget.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, I yield 2 minutes to the Senator from Rhode \nIsland.\n  Mr. PELL. Last week, the National Goals Panel issued an extensive \nreport on the progress American schools are making towards meeting the \nnational goals. That report was a mixed one. We have made gains in \nareas such as mathematics achievement and making sure that our children \nenter school ready to learn. In other areas, such as reading \nachievement and teacher preparation, we are only holding our own. And \nin some areas, most notably safe and drug free schools, our problems \nappear to be growing.\n  In my opinion, there is a clear conclusion we can draw from this \nreport. This is not the time to either relax or diminish the small, but \ncritical Federal role in education. Quite to the contrary, it is time \nto strengthen our commitment if we are to sustain the gains we have \nmade, move off of dead center in other areas, and reverse the decline \nin still others.\n  Most clearly, this is not the time to have the largest education cut \nin our history. It is not the time to risk a 30-percent cut in Federal \neducation spending over the next 7 years. It is not the time to freeze \nthe title I program and halt progress in basic skills achievement. It \nis not the time to cut spending on education reform. And, it is \ndefinitely not the time to reduce our commitment to safe and drug free \nschools.\n  With respect to higher education, I believe deeply that we should not \nput our student aid programs at risk. Yet, that is precisely what the \nRepublican budget does. If we cut education by more than 30 percent \nover the next 7 years, it is clear that every education program will be \nin harm's way. We have already engaged in a hard-fought battle to \nprotect students and their families from cuts in the guaranteed student \nloan program, and I am pleased that in large part, we have been \nsuccessful.\n  While I had reservations about the Direct Loan Program when it was \noriginally proposed, I am encouraged by how well the program has \noperated \n\n[[Page S 17259]]\nin its initial stages. Students are getting their loans more quickly \nand with less problems. The competition between direct lending and the \nregular guaranteed loan programs has also produced dramatic \nimprovements in the private sector program. Because of this, I believe \nit unwise to move back and place a 10 percent cap on direct lending. \nThis would mean that between two-thirds and three-fourths of current \ndirect lending schools would be dropped from the program, and to my \nmind, that would be most unfortunate.\n  I also fear that we will face difficult battles with respect to our \nother student aid programs, and that Pell grants, supplemental grants, \nPerkins loans, college work study, and the TRIO programs could well be \nplaced on the chopping block.\n  Mr. President, education is a capital investment in our future. The \nclimb up the economic ladder for American after American is directly \nrelated to their level of educational achievement. Every study we know \nshows a correlation between an educational attainment and an increase \nin income. If we pull back on education, we pull back on the American \npeople. That is not the direction in which we should be moving.\n  I agree wholeheartedly with President Clinton when he says that, \ntoday, we face both a budget deficit and an education deficit, and that \nboth must be addressed.\n  I favor reducing the budget deficit. I do not favor doing it on the \nbacks of senior citizens, the unfortunate in our society, our children \nwho need a good, solid general education, or our students and families \nwho are already hard-pressed to make ends meet in paying for a college \neducation.\n  In my view, one of the best ways we can reduce the budget deficit is \nthrough a strong and vibrant economy driven by a well-educated, well-\ntrained work force. It is time that we increased our investment in \neducation. It is not a time for retreat.\n  Mr. President, it is time to calm the shrill voices of partisanship \nthat have echoed through our Chamber. It is time to move away from the \nabyss of brinkmanship. It is time for all parties to come together, and \nto fashion a budget that enjoys wide bipartisan support. For comity to \nbe practiced. And most of all, it is time that we got on with governing \nin a way that the American people can respect.\n\n\n                         student loan provision\n\n  Mr. President, I want to call to my colleagues' attention and call \ninto question an important student loan provision included in the \nbudget reconciliation conference agreement reached by the majority \nwithout the involvement of the minority.\n  This provision with which I am concerned requires State guaranty \nagencies to use 50 percent of their reserves to purchase defaulted \nloans. Once purchased, the agency has 180 days before it can submit \nclaims for reimbursement. The idea is that this will allow additional \ntime to bring defaulters into repayment, thus decreasing the total \namount of claims for reimbursement.\n  There are at least two problems with this provision. First, it \nappears to assume that these reserves are the property of the State \nguaranty agency and not the Federal Government. If that is the case, we \nmay well be relinquishing any claim for almost $1 billion in \noutstanding and quite possibly excess reserves that are Federal \nproperty and could be returned to the Federal Government to produce \nsavings in the guaranteed student loan program.\n  If we assume they are not the property of the State guaranty agency, \nthen we are simply permitting Federal funds to be used to purchase \ndefaulted loans guaranteed by the Federal Government in the first \nplace. If this is the case, we will be engaging in a shell game that \nproduces illusory savings.\n  Second, the provision allows defaulted loans that are purchased with \nthese funds to be considered reserves. This diminishes the required \nreserve ratio, also reduced in this legislation, used to help determine \nwhether or not an agency is strong and solvent. It would quite possibly \nallow an otherwise bankrupt agency to use defaulted loans as assets to \nmeet the decreased reserve ratio. To my mind, this is not good public \npolicy.\n  Further, in my view, it is difficult, under any circumstance, to see \nhow a defaulted loan can be construed as an asset. This is potentially \nbad paper. We may never be able to collect the debt, and yet under this \nprovision, Federal law would decree that a defaulted loan, a debt, is \nan asset.\n  Requiring agencies to purchase defaulted loans with reserves that may \nor may not be their property is a roll of the dice. They may well be \nbad investments with minimal chance of collection. To say that they \nshould be considered assets is, to my mind, very unwise. And, to take \nthe chance that they also take reserves out of the reach of the Federal \nGovernment is equally imprudent.\n  Also, I am concerned that during the 180-day period that State \nguaranty agencies hold the defaulted loans, the Federal Government may \nwell continue to pay special allowance and other interest payments on \nthese loans. I wonder whether or not this produces an unwarranted \nwindfall for these agencies by giving them income on a defaulted loan.\n  Finally, I would point out that had we had the opportunity to be \ninvolved in the budget reconciliation negotiations between the House \nand Senate, this would have been pointed out at the staff level. \nUnfortunately, for the first time in seven reconciliation and budget \nreduction conferences involving the guaranteed student loan program, \nthe minority was not permitted to come to the table and make its case. \nThis is an unfortunate departure from the bipartisanship that has been \nthe traditional practice in education, and in this instance, I am \nafraid it has resulted in a highly questionable provision.\n\n\n    submitting changes to the budget resolution revenue allocations\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, upon the submission of a conference \nreport on a reconciliation bill, section 205(b) of House Concurrent \nResolution 67 requires the chairman of the Senate Budget Committee to \nappropriately revise the budgetary allocations and aggregates to \naccommodate the revenue reductions in the reconciliation bill \nconference report.\n  Pursuant to section 205(b) of House Concurrent Resolution 67, the \n1996 budget resolution, I hereby submit revisions to the first- and \nfive-year revenue aggregates contained in House Concurrent Resolution \n67 for the purpose of consideration of H.R. 2491, the Balanced Budget \nAct of 1995, and ask unanimous consent that the revisions be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                                        \n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                      1996                1996-2000     \n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nCurrent revenue aggregates..    $1,042,500,000,000    $5,691,500,000,000\nRevised revenue aggregates..     1,036,780,000,000     5,543,726,000,000\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n  The Congressional Budget Office has reviewed the conference report on \nH.R. 2491, and has certified that the enactment of the Balanced Budget \nAct of 1995 would produce a small budget surplus in 2002.\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, I believe that the majority's desire to \ninclude tax breaks in this bill has caused two points of order to lie \nagainst this bill.\n  It has long been my belief that the tax breaks have been the tail \nthat has wagged this dog of a budget. They have driven the majority to \nmake extreme cuts in Medicare and education.\n  And their desire for tax breaks for the wealthy has also driven the \nmajority to jump through some pretty high procedural hoops. I hope to \ndemonstrate over the next few minutes that the majority has abused the \nbudget reconciliation process and violated the conditions of the budget \nresolution to pave the way for these misguided tax breaks.\n  The budget resolution that created this budget reconciliation bill \nprovided that the majority could cut taxes if and only if two \nconditions were met: One, they had to balance the budget in 2002. And, \ntwo, the reconciliation legislation had to ``compl[y] with the sum of \nthe reconciliation directives for the period of fiscal years 1996 \nthrough 2002'' in the budget resolution. These two conditions are \nplainly spelled out in section 205 of the budget resolution. I ask \nunanimous consent that the full text of section 205 of the budget \nresolution be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n[[Page S 17260]]\n\n\n     SEC. 205.

Section 205 of the budget resolution gives the majority the \nauthority to lower the revenue floor in the budget resolution. Without \nsection 205, the majority would violate the revenue floor in the budget \nresolution by including tax cuts in this bill.\n  But the facts are that the conference report before us today fails to \nmeet the two conditions in section 205 for including tax cuts. The \nbudget resolution directed committees to come up with $632 billion in \ndeficit reduction over the next 7 years in order to be allowed to \ninclude tax cuts in this bill. The bill before us includes only $577 \nbillion in spending cuts, plus $3.7 billion in revenue increases in the \njurisdiction of a committee with instructions to increase revenues, for \na net of $581 billion in deficit reduction.\n  That is $51 billion short of the amount committees were instructed to \nachieve by the budget resolution. The bill is thus $51 billion short of \nthe amount necessary to allow the chairman of the Budget Committee to \nlower the budget resolution's revenue floor to allow for the tax \nbreaks.\n  As a consequence, the tax cuts cause this bill to violate the budget \nresolution's revenue floor.\n  Therefore, Mr. President, a point of order should lie against this \nconference report because it violates section 311(a) of the \nCongressional Budget Act of 1974.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the full test of the CBO \ncost estimate on this bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n                                                    U.S. Congress,\n\n\n                                  Congressional Budget Office,\n\n                                Washington, DC, November 16, 1995.\n     Hon.

These projections use the \n     economic and technical assumptions underlying the budget \n     resolution for fiscal year 1996 (H. Con. Res. 67), assume the \n     level of discretionary spending indicated in the budget \n     resolution, and include changes in outlays and revenues \n     estimated to result from the economic impact of balancing the \n     budget by fiscal year 2002 as estimated by CBO in its April \n     1995 report, An Analysis of the President's Budgetary \n     Proposals for Fiscal Year 1996. On that basis, CBO projects \n     that enactment of the reconciliation legislation recommended \n     by the conferees would produce a small budget surplus in \n     2002. The estimated federal spending, revenues and deficits \n     that would occur if the proposal is enacted are shown in \n     Table 1.

proceeds from asset sales are counted in the budget totals for purposes of Congressional scoring. Under the Balanced\n  Budget Act, however, proceeds from asset sales are not counted in determining compliance with the discretionary spending limits or pay-as-you-go      \n  requirement.                                                                                                                                          \nb CBO cannot estimate whether this proposal would, on balance, increase or decrease spending for Medicare.                                              \n\n\n  Mr. EXON. Turning to the second point of order,\n  If my colleagues consider the issue fairly, I believe they will agree \nthat the tax title violates section 313(b)(1)(E) of the Budget Act. \nThat subparagraph prohibits provisions that balloon the deficit in the \nout-years, unless the loss is offset by out-year savings from other \nprovisions contained in the same title. I ask unanimous consent that \nthe text and legislative history of section 313(b)(1)(E) of the Budget \nAct be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       (E) \\1\\ a provision shall be considered to be extraneous if \n     it increases, or would increase, net outlays,\\2\\ or if it \n     decreases, or would decrease, revenues during a fiscal year \n     after the fiscal years covered by such reconciliation bill or \n     reconciliation resolution,\\3\\ and such increases or decreases \n     are greater \\4\\ than outlay reductions or revenue increases \n     resulting from other provisions in such title \\5\\ in such \n     year; \\6\\\n\n\n                               footnotes\n\n     \\1\\ Section 205(b) of the Balanced Budget and Emergency \n     Deficit Control Reaffirmation Act of 1987 added subparagraph \n     (E). Pub. L. No. 100-119, Sec. 205(b), 101 Stat. 754, 784-85 \n     (1987).\n     \\2\\ Section 3(1) defines ``outlays.''\n     \\3\\ Section 310(b) defines ``reconciliation resolution.''\n     \\4\\ The Congressional Budget Act makes no exception for \n     violations of negligible amounts.\n     \\5\\ This basis of extraneousness depends on the balance of \n     the title in which the drafters locate a provision. \n     Consequently, attentive drafters can avoid this violation by \n     combining or rearranging the contents of titles so as to \n     ensure that no title worsens the deficit in any out-year.\n     \\6\\ Section 205(b) of the Balanced Budget and Emergency \n     Deficit Control Reaffirmation Act of 1987 added subparagraph \n     (E). Pub. L. No. 100-119, Sec. 205(b), 101 Stat. 754, 784-85 \n     (1987). The joint statement of managers in the conference \n     report on that bill stated with regard to subparagraph (E):\n     6. Extraneous Provisions in Reconciliation Legislation\n     Current Law:\n       Title XX of the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation \n     Act of 1985 (P.L. 99-272), as amended by Section 7006 of the \n     Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1986 (P.L. 99-509), \n     established a temporary rule in the Senate--referred to as \n     the ``Byrd Rule''--to exclude extraneous matter from \n     reconciliation legislation. The rule specifies the types of \n     provisions considered to be extraneous, provides for a point \n     of order against the inclusion of extraneous matter in \n     reconciliation measures, and requires a three-fifths vote of \n     the Senate to waive or appeal the point of order. The rule \n     expires on January 2, 1988.\n     Senate Amendment:\n       The Senate amendment (Section 228) amends the Byrd Rule \n     (which applies only in the Senate) to include in the \n     definition of extraneous matter provisions which increase net \n     outlays or decrease revenues during a fiscal year beyond \n     those fiscal years covered by the reconciliation measure and \n     which result in a net increase in the deficit for that fiscal \n     year. The Senate amendment also extends the expiration date \n     of the Byrd Rule to September 30, 1992.\n     Conference Agreement:\n       The House recedes and concurs in the Senate amendment. This \n     rule applies only in the Senate.\n       It is the intent of the conferees that expiration after the \n     reconciliation period of a revenue increase or extension \n     provided for in a reconciliation bill would not, of itself, \n     be considered a revenue decrease for purposes of this \n     provision. It could, however, contribute to a finding that a \n     spending increase or a positive revenue decrease in that \n     legislation violated this rule.\n\n     H.R. Conf. Rep. No. 100-313, 100th Cong., 1st Sess. 65 \n     (1987), reprinted in 1987 U.S.C.C.A.N. 739, 765.\n\n  Mr. EXON. And I say to my colleagues that the tax title in the \nreconciliation conference report creates enormous loses in the out-\nyears. Just look at the capital gains provisions, for example, which \nlose nearly $12 billion in 2002, over $13 billion in 2003, and nearly \n$16 billion in 2004. And these numbers are from the Joint Committee on \nTaxation, which understates the losses from capital gains relative to \nthe estimates of the Treasury Department.\n  In total, the tax breaks in this bill worsen the deficit by over $47 \nbillion in 2003, over $51 billion in 2004, and nearly $57 billion in \n2005. These tax cuts continue in the out-years to dig us into a deeper \nand deeper hole.

The majority could have prevented this drain on the \nTreasury in the out-years by sunsetting the tax provisions. I read in \nthe press that, at one time, they were actively considering such a \nnotion. But they did not. The tax cuts continue to add to the debt year \nafter year.\n  It is this Senator's view that it is self-evident from the Joint Tax \ntable that the tax title does indeed worsen the deficit in years beyond \nthe 7 years covered by this reconciliation bill. It is thus this \nSenator's view that the violation of section 313(b)(1)(E) is plain.\n  Some may argue that I am setting an impossible standard for ever \nenacting tax cuts. Quite to the contrary, my colleagues on the other \nside could have avoided this point of order in a number of ways. I am \nnot here to give free parliamentary advice, but they could have \nsunsetted the tax breaks, as I noted earlier. They could have included \nthe tax breaks in the same title as the Medicare spending cuts. Or, \nduring consideration of the budget resolution reconciliation \ninstructions, they could have specified that section 313(b)(1)(E) would \nnot apply to the tax breaks. Any one of these three steps would have \nprevented a violation of the point of order. But they didn't do any of \nthem.\n  Therefore, Mr. President, I believe a point of order should lie \nagainst subtitles A through D of title XI of this conference report \nbecause they violate section 313(b)(1)(E) of the Congressional Budget \nAct of 1974.\n  Mr. President, I understand that the parliamentarian has advised that \nhe will not agree that these 2 points of order lie against the bill. \nEveryone should have known that the fix is in for these tax breaks. If \nthere had been any doubt, that doubt has now been set aside. The \nmajority has demonstrated that it will do whatever it needs to do--\nincluding bend and stretch the rule--to protect its cherished tax \nbreaks for the wealthy.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from \nFlorida.\n  Mr. MACK. Mr. President, thank you.\n  Mr. President, this is a moment, frankly, for which I have been \nwaiting since I made the decision to run for Congress in October 1981 \njust over 14 years ago. I left a career in the financial market to \nbecome a member of Congress. I came here with the idea that we \nabsolutely had to get control of the growth of Federal Government and \nits spending. So, to me, this is a historic moment. Now I want to \nrespond to Senator Pell's comment a moment ago about the shrill \npartisanship --and I know that from time to \n\n[[Page S 17280]]\ntime there are some extreme expressions of feeling with respect to what \nwe are doing--but I would just like to remind each of us in the Senate \nthat the reason there may be shrillness in this debate, is because we \nare finally at the moment when we are debating what fundamentally \ndivides us.\n  Those on the left absolutely believe that the answers to America's \nproblems come from more Government. And frankly, Republicans reject \nthat. We think that America's future is based on the individual, that \nthe our limitation is the one we place on our own imagination. And the \nGovernment, in fact, is a great player in that limitation. So the \nreason that we are having such a strong debate is because we are \narguing over the principles that divide us. And, frankly, I am thankful \nthat this moment finally has arrived.\n  Maybe it is because my son called me the other night and told me that \nhe just got engaged. Twenty-eight years old, and I could not be prouder \nof a son. But, I think about the future in which Connie will live, and \nI think about my daughter, who is in her thirties, with three \ngrandsons--the cutest little guys in the world--I think about their \nfutures. And so, I ask you to excuse me if I become passionate about \nwhat I have to say and the things I believe, because I honestly believe \nthat the direction we have been headed will destroy this Nation. And \nthat is why I feel so passionately about the items that we have been \ndiscussing.\n  There is something fundamental that has happened over the last few \ndays, though. And I think it is important for people to recognize it. \nFor 3 years journalists, writers, and TV commentators have been trying \nto figure out just who is Bill Clinton. What does he stand for? When is \nhe going to stand up and fight for what he believes in?\n  And, I find it interesting that Bill Clinton has chosen this time and \nthis issue to finally draw the line in the sand. You know what Bill \nClinton is saying, ``I am opposed to balancing the budget in the next 7 \nyears.'' I am glad that he finally has made this statement and made \nthis stand. Bill Clinton has now finally told the people in this \ncountry what he stands for, what he believes in. It is more Government, \nmore taxes, and more Federal spending. He has drawn the line in the \nsand and he has told the people of this country, through his actions in \nthe last few days, that he is in opposition to balancing the budget in \nthe next 7 years.\n  The second point I would like to raise has to do with a very \nfundamental part of what we are doing. And, yes, we are cutting the \nrate on capital gains. And you know why we are doing it? Because we \nbelieve that growth will take place as a result of this cut. And as a \nresult of that growth, those little grandchildren that I talked about \nand my son are going to have a greater opportunity in the future, and \nwith opportunity comes hope.\n  That is what we are trying to do for the American people. That is why \nwe are making this commitment. Do you know today that there is over \n$1.5 trillion locked up in the stock market because of high capital \ngains tax rates? It is time to unlock that capital. It is time to allow \nthat capital to flow into the new technologies that will develop \nAmerica's future.\n\n  Oh, it is very popular to take the position of going after the \nwealthy. If you look at the record, you will find that when the wealthy \ninvest America, everyone is better off.\n  The other issue my friends on the other side of the aisle like to \nmention is Medicare. In fact, I heard one of the earlier speakers refer \nto the Medicare issue by saying the budget provision was going to rip \nthe heart out of Medicare. Well, frankly, I am at a loss over how you \ncan rip the heart out of Medicare while allowing it to grow from $4,800 \na year to $6,700 a year.\n  Mr. President, I yield back my time.\n  Mr. EXON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. EXON. I yield at least 8 minutes--no more than 10 minutes--to my \ncolleague from Arkansas.\n  Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, I thank the Chair, and thank my friend from \nNebraska.\n  I spent most of today looking through the Republican package, \nspecifically with respect to the so-called nursing home standards that \nhave been included in this legislation before us tonight.\n  Mr. President, I cannot say strongly enough how deeply offended I am \nby the extraordinary means that have been used to undermine the \nprogress made in the most basic nursing home protections that have been \nwon over the past 3 decades. I think that these Republican assaults on \nnursing home safeguards are no less than callous--I hate to say that--\nand will open the door to a litany of further abuses that we have \nattempted to cure since the 1960's. The Republican leadership, through \nthis attack, is saying basically ``too old, too sick, too bad'' to \nresidents of nursing home facilities across our country.\n  Mr. President, before I touch on some of the most glaring offenses of \nthis package, I want to tell my colleagues that the law which this \nbudget package is completely undermining, the 1987 nursing home quality \nstandards law, was developed on a bipartisan basis, was agreed to by \nall interested groups, including the nursing home industry, nursing \nhome advocates, care providers, unions, States, and finally, yes, the \nCongress of the United States. It followed literally years of \ndiscussions and came about because the record of the States in \npreventing nursing home abuse was appalling.\n  In 1986 the report by the National Academy of Sciences, which was \ncommissioned by the Congress, found shocking evidence of deficient care \nand inadequate enforcement. The study found that Government regulations \nof nursing homes, which was then conducted by the States, was totally \nunsatisfactory because it allowed too many marginal or substandard \nnursing homes to continue in operation.\n  Mr. President, that was how it was during a time when lack of money \nwas not all that much of a problem. Now, at this critical moment, as we \nprepare to severely reduce Medicaid funding to the States, the \nRepublican budget also abdicates nearly all Federal responsibility to \nour most vulnerable citizens, the disabled and the infirm elderly in \nour nursing homes across our land.\n  What we have before us, Mr. President, in this basic conference \nreport that we will be voting on in a short time--this conference \nreport includes what I declare as an abdication of our Federal role, an \nabdication of our responsibility to the 2 million nursing home \nresidents in our country today.\n  In this Republican budget we find that their version of what \nconstitutes nursing home standards, in my opinion, is a warped version \nof the current law. Some very crafty legislative drafters have spent \nlong hours in their attempts to totally and completely undercut the \nbasic progress that we have made over the past years in protecting the \nnursing home residents from abuse.\n  Let me try to explain exactly what this means:\n  Where current law allows for Federal standards for nurse aide \ntraining, they are eliminated.\n  Where current law allows for Federal guidance with respect to \ntransfers and discharges, the Republican proposal eliminates all \nguidance in that area.\n  Where current law, Mr. President, prohibits discrimination against \nMedicaid residents and prohibits facilities from charging residents, \ntheir families or friends to guarantee admission to the facility, those \nFederal protections by the Republicans are totally removed from this \nbill.\n  Where current law requires Federal guidelines to qualify as a \nfacility administrator, these guidelines are totally removed, Mr. \nPresident. They are now left to the States.\n  Where current law requires that facilities meet Federal standards \nwith respect to protecting residents' personal funds, these protections \nare totally stricken and left up to the States and to the nursing home \nowners.\n  Where current law imposes requirements for sound administration of a \nfacility, these guarantees are totally expunged from the record.\n  To add insult to injury, in addition to abdicating so many Federal \nresponsibilities to these vulnerable individuals and dumping these \nrequirements on the States, the Republican plan now before us would \nalso eliminate any required date by which the States must be sure to \nmeet its responsibility that had formerly been handled by the Secretary \nof HHS. \n\n[[Page S 17281]]\n\n  So we are now saying that States must meet these requirements \nwhenever, but not at a specific time. This is unconscionable, Mr. \nPresident. How can we in less than a decade abandon these nursing home \nresidents? How can we, by a vote of 51 to 48 in this body, say we want \nthe strongest standards, and again just a few days ago by a vote of 95 \nto 1 on Monday of this week, and now walk away from all of those \nstandards and say we are abdicating our responsibilities? What in the \nworld is going on?\n  What we are about to do is basically to begin a program of \nwarehousing the elderly population of our country. We have identified \nat least 11 basic nursing home standards that have been abolished under \nthis plan. I know that there are many more.\n  This plan allows homes to extort money in return for a guarantee of \nadmission to a facility. Under present law, Mr. President, this is \nprohibited. Now we are abolishing that prohibition.\n  The Republican plan allows facilities to commingle residents' \nindividual savings accounts.\n  It allows homes to keep the interest on resident savings accounts \nbelow $250.\n  And it goes on and on and on. In fact, it kills Senator John \nDanforth's self-determination provision on living wills so that \nresidents will have all of the information about making and what \nconstitutes a valid living will.\n  Mr. President, further, what other quality assurance protection does \nthe budget package eliminate? It cuts down the fines from $10,000 to \n$5,000 per nursing home. The budget plan eliminates the uniform \nassessment tool which has been hailed universally by providers, States, \nsurveyors, and residents alike, and by those people who service \nombudsman nursing home patients and the residents.\n  All of these changes are bad enough. This legislation allows private \nentities to certify that facilities have met the quality standards, \nfurther reducing accountability of the State and the facilities to meet \nthe Federal guidelines of the Government.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If the Senator will suspend for one moment \nwhile the Chair gets order. Those Members and staff members in the back \nwho are having conversations, please take your conversations to the \nCloakroom.\n  Mr. PRYOR. May I inquire as to how much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has used 7 minutes, 36 seconds.\n  Mr. PRYOR. I thank the Chair for maintaining order.\n  Mr. President, I do not have time to complete my statement. Let me \njust say that the National Citizens' Coalition for Nursing Home Reform \nhas written me today urging that we look very carefully at passing this \nlegislation. The AARP, in their press release this afternoon, expressed \ntheir concern about the enforcement of nursing home quality standards \nand implies that they are further weakened in this particular \nconference report.\n  The Nursing Home National Seniors Center, run by Toby Edelman, has \ndone a memorandum that I am going to ask be printed in the Record, and \nother documents, Mr. President.\n  I also have a letter from Service Employees. These four documents I \nask unanimous consent to be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                  National Citizens' Coalition for\n\n\n                                          Nursing Home Reform,\n\n                                Washington, DC, November 17, 1995.\n     Hon. David Pryor,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Pryor: The National Citizens' Coalition for \n     Nursing Home Reform (NCCNHR) has grave concerns about the \n     language regarding nursing home standards contained in the \n     report from the Conference Committee. We are extremely \n     disappointed by the disconcerting language accepted by the \n     Committee members. Although the Conference language resembles \n     the current Nursing Home Reform Act, it serves to \n     significantly weaken and undermine the current standards, to \n     the dangerous detriment of residents of nursing homes.\n       Our preliminary review of the conference language has \n     identified the following areas of concern:\n       Elimination of the requirement for facilities to provide \n     care and services to allow each resident to attain or \n     maintain his or her ``highest practicable level of physical, \n     mental, and psychosocial functioning.''\n       Elimination of the right to quality care and quality of \n     life for each resident. Instead, the conference language \n     speaks to ``residents'' collectively.\n       Elimination of the requirement of federal standards for \n     conducting a resident assessment using a national uniform \n     minimum data set.\n       Loss of protections against discrimination based on source \n     of payment and duration of stay contracts upon admission.\n       Elimination of federal standards for nurse aide training--\n     including elimination of required 75 hours of training.\n       Elimination of the requirement for facilities with 120+ \n     beds to employ a qualified social worker.\n       Substantial watering down of transfer and discharge \n     protections.\n       Significant weakening of survey and certification \n     requirements, including:\n       A two-year survey cycle (changed from 9-15 months).\n       Elimination of comprehensive training for state and federal \n     surveyors.\n       Less frequent federal validation surveys--from yearly to \n     every 3 years.\n       Public disclosure of survey results--``within a reasonable \n     time,'' instead of the current, within 14 days.\n       Significant weakening of enforcement provisions, including:\n       Elimination of language requiring application of remedies \n     in such a way as to minimize the time between the \n     identification of violations and the final imposition of \n     remedies.\n       Elimination of language calling for incrementally more \n     severe fines for repeated or uncorrected deficiencies.\n       Elimination of retroactive civil money penalties for past \n     noncompliance.\n       Reduction of highest civil money penalty from $10,000 to \n     $5,000.\n       Provision allowing for deemed status to accrediting \n     agencies.\n       This weakening of the federal standards is unwarranted and \n     unconscionable. Based on a review of proposals submitted by \n     the American Health Care Association, it is clear that the \n     nursing home industry played a major role in the drafting of \n     these provisions--a fact that again highlights the leverage \n     this industry has at the state and national level.\n       We strongly urge you, and your colleagues, to oppose this \n     language. It can only serve to destroy the progress brought \n     by the 1987 Nursing Home Reform Act--a law passed with \n     bipartisan support by a previous Congress.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   Elma L. Holder,\n     Executive Director.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n                  [From the AARP News, Nov. 16, 1995]\n\n        AARP Statement on the Budget Reconciliation Act of 1995\n\n       The American Association of Retired Persons (AARP) remains \n     very concerned about the magnitude of reductions to Medicare \n     and Medicaid contained in the conference report to the Budget \n     Reconciliation Act. While the report includes some further \n     improvements, Congress still has a long way to go.\n       The Association is pleased that the Medicare Part-B \n     deductible remains at $100 a year, as in the House bill. But \n     the total cuts to Medicare and Medicaid over seven years are \n     still too much, too fast, and enforcement of nursing home \n     quality standards has been further weakened in the report.\n       Four hundred billion dollars in cuts from these two major \n     health care programs that serve older and low-income \n     Americans do not meet the fairness test. Reductions in \n     Medicare called for in the conference report are much more \n     than is necessary to keep the program solvent into the next \n     decade.\n       Millions of American families depend on Medicare and \n     Medicaid for their basic health care coverage, for protection \n     against the high cost of long-term care and for financial \n     security. These protections, for Americans of all ages, are \n     now at risk.\n       Cutting $164 billion from Medicaid over the next seven \n     years is far more than the program can shoulder. Frail, older \n     Americans, most of whom are single, elderly women who have \n     worked hard all of their lives, and children from low-income \n     families would be the hardest hit by such drastic cuts.\n       At this juncture in the budget debate, it's a shame that a \n     veto is necessary, but unfortunately, there is no other \n     alternative. AARP will continue to work with Congress and the \n     Administration to get fair legislation that ensures future \n     Medicare solvency and reduces the federal budget deficit.\n                                                                    ____\n\n     Memorandum.\n     To: Interested people.\n      From: Toby Eldeman.\n     Re conference committee language on nursing home reform.\n     Date: November 16, 1995.\n       I've just gotten the conference committee language and have \n     gone very quickly through it to compare it with the current \n     law and with the proposals made by the American Health Care \n     Association.\n       The language represents a dramatic step backwards in all \n     respects: the standards facilities would be required to meet, \n     the survey and certification process, and the enforcement \n     system. On my first quick reading, I think the most serious \n     problems are:\n       1. Standards for facilities:\n       A. Loss of the entitlement to high quality of care for each \n     individual resident; the language speaks of care to \n     ``residents.''\n       B. Loss of language ``highest practicable physical, mental, \n     and psychosocial well-being'' as description of required \n     services.\n\n[[Page S 17282]]\n\n       C. Loss of protections against Medicaid discrimination in \n     admission.\n       D. Loss of federal standards for nurse aid training, \n     transfer and discharge, resident assessment. States would \n     have sole authority to determine standards.\n       E. Loss of Secretary's duty and responsibility for \n     standards, enforcement and federal money.\n       F. Substantial watering down of protections in transfer and \n     discharge.\n       G. Financial issues: loss of rules specifying what care and \n     services are covered by Medicaid and what care and services \n     are not; protection for Medicaid residents who pay the entire \n     Medicaid rate as their share of cost.\n       2. Survey and certification\n       A. Two year survey cycle.\n       B. Loss of comprehensive training for surveyors by \n     Secretary.\n       C. Reduced federal validation surveys; from annual to every \n     3 years.\n       D. Public disclosure of survey results--from within 14 \n     calendar days of providing to facility to ``within a \n     reasonable time.''\n       3. Enforcement\n       /A. Deemed status to accrediting agencies (very serious \n     issue).\n       B. Loss of language for both states and Secretary requiring \n     enforcement systems that minimize the time between \n     identification of deficiencies and imposition of remedies; \n     more severe penalties for more serious or uncorrected \n     deficiencies.\n       C. Loss of retroactive civil money penalties.\n       D. Reduction of highest civil money penalty to $5000.\n       It looks to me as if, generally, the conferees listened to \n     AHCA on the Requirements for facilities and to the Governors \n     on survey, certification, and enforcement.\n       Section of bill--What the change is and why the change is a \n     problem. Whether AHCA proposed the change.\n       2137(b)(1)(A)--Quality of life: adds the word \n     ``reasonably'' before promotes,'' thus qualifying the \n     requirement.--Yes\n       2137(b)(2)--Scope of services and activities under plan of \n     care: deletes current language ``to attain and maintain the \n     highest practicable physical, mental, and psychosocial well-\n     being'' after services and activities: the new language \n     requires facilities ``to provide services and activities in \n     accordance with a written plan of care.''--Yes\n       2137(b)(3)(A)(ii)--Resident assessment: says the instrument \n     is specified by the state; deletes the requirement that the \n     assessment be based on minimum data set specified by the \n     Secretary.--No\n       2137(b)(3)(E)--Resident assessment: requires facility to \n     notify state mental health authority or mental retardation or \n     developmental disability authority, as applicable, of change \n     in physical or mental condition of a resident who is mentally \n     ill or mentally retarded. New requirement.--No\n       Deletes preadmission screening and annual resident review \n     (PASARR). We don't disagree with this deletion.--Yes\n       2137(b)(4)(A)(i)--Provision of services and activities: \n     deletes ``to attain and maintain the highest practicable \n     physical, mental, and psychosocial well-being'' after \n     ``nursing and related services and specialized rehabilitative \n     services.''.--Yes\n       2137(b)(4)(A)--Provision of services: changes language from \n     providing services to ``each resident'' to ``residents'' for \n     social services (2137(b)(4)(A)(ii)); pharmaceutical services \n     (2137(b)(4)(A)(iii)); dietary services (2137(b)(4)(A)(iv)); \n     activities (2137(b)(4)(A)(v)); dental services \n     (2137(b)(4)(A)(v)).--Yes\n       2137(b)(4)(A)--Provision of services: deletes mental health \n     services for mentally ill and mentally retarded residents.--\n     Yes\n       2137(B)(5)(F)(iii)--Nurse aid training: Adds a new \n     exclusion from definition of nurse aide; excludes a person \n     ``who is trained, whether compensated or not, to perform a \n     task-specific function which assists residents in their daily \n     activities.'' The industry has wanted this language to hire \n     people to feed residents and do other tasks, but not to train \n     them as nurse aides.--Yes\n       Excludes current language requiring facilities with more \n     than 120 beds from having at least one social worker with at \n     least a bachelor's degree in social work or similar \n     professional qualifications. 1396r(b)(7).--No\n       2137(c)(1)(A)(v)--Residents rights: accommodation of needs; \n     adds language after the right to receive notice before room \n     or roommate is changed to say ``unless a delay in changing \n     the room or roommate while notice is given would endanger the \n     resident or others.'' The industry has not liked giving \n     notice.--Yes\n       Excludes current language giving residents the right to \n     refuse certain transfers (transfers facilities make to get \n     coverage under a payment program). 1396r(c)(1)(A)(x).--Yes\n       2137(c)(2)(B)(ii)(V)--Transfer and discharge: adds a new \n     reason not to have to give a 30 day notice: ``a case where \n     the provision of a 30-day notice would be impossible or \n     impracticable.'' This language essentially eliminate the 30-\n     day notice requirement; facilities would always claim it was \n     impossible or impracticable to give 30 day notice.--Yes\n       2137(c)(2)(B)(iv)--Transfer and discharge: adds a new \n     ``exception'' statement; ``This subparagraph shall not apply \n     to a voluntary transfer or discharge necessitated by a \n     medical emergency.'' Since there is no definition of \n     ``voluntary,'' we would see many transfers and discharges \n     called voluntary.--Yes\n       2137(c)(2)(C)--Orientation for transfer and discharge: \n     changes the language to require just ``reasonable'' \n     preparation and orientation; and instead of requiring, as \n     current law does, that preparation and orientation ``ensure \n     safe and orderly transfer or discharge,'' the new language \n     requires only that preparation and orientation ``promote'' \n     safe and orderly transfer or discharge.--Yes\n       2137(c)(2)(D)(iii)--Bed reserve: adds language to confirm \n     that a resident is not entitled to the next available bed if \n     it is a private room.--Yes\n       Deletes current language requiring facilities to give \n     information to residents about advance directives. \n     1396r(c)(2)(E).--No\n       2137(c)(3)(C)--Access and visitation rights: adds new \n     qualification to visits by saying there is immediate access \n     ``unless such access would endanger the health or safety of \n     the resident or others in the facility.'' Denying access to \n     family members who complain is common. This language would \n     strengthen facilities' ability to deny access to visitors. \n     Notice that the language does not include this qualification \n     for any other category of visitor.--Yes\n       Deletes current language prohibiting discrimination in \n     admission. 1396r(c)(2)(5).--Yes\n       2137(c)(5)(B)(i)--Protection of residents funds: raises the \n     amount that must be deposited in an interest bearing account \n     to $250. Note that the personal needs allowance is $35 per \n     month (although states may allow more).--Yes\n       2137(c)(5)(B)(ii)--Protection of resident funds: deletes a \n     word from the current language, which I think is \n     ``separate.'' If that's the deletion, the language would no \n     longer require separate accountings of residents' funds.--Yes\n       Deletes current language requiring facilities to notify \n     residents when their balances are $200 less than the amount \n     that would make them lose Medicaid eligibility.--No\n       2137(c)(5)(B)(iii)--Protection of resident funds: \n     conveyance upon death: adds language ``All other personal \n     property, including medical records, shall be considered part \n     of the resident's estate and shall only be released to the \n     administrator of the estate.'' This language would appear to \n     allow facilities to keep residents' property and release it \n     only to the administrator of the estate. It would also enable \n     facilities to deny medical records to family members unless \n     they were appointed administrator.--Yes\n       Deletes current language which defines as a Medicaid person \n     an individual whose share of cost equals the entire Medicaid \n     rate. These people currently are considered Medicaid \n     residents and cannot be charged more than the Medicaid rate. \n     1396r(c)(7)(B).--Yes\n       2137(d)(1)(C)--Nursing facility administrator: adds \n     language to require administrators of all facilities, whether \n     freestanding or hospital-based, to meet the Secretary's \n     standards. The industry has been interested in making \n     hospital-based facilities meet nursing facility standards. \n     This is one way to make it difficult for hospital-based \n     facilities to be nursing facilities.--Yes\n       2137(d)(4)(A)--Miscellaneous administrative issues: \n     compliance with federal, state, and local laws and \n     professional standards: applies this language to hospital-\n     based facilities. Same reasoning as above.--Yes\n       2137(e)(1)--State requirements; specification and review of \n     nurse aide training; deletes current requirements that state \n     nurse aide training program meet federal standards.--No\n       2137(e)(3)--State requirements; state appeals process for \n     transfers and discharges; deletes current requirement that \n     states meet federal standards on appeals process.--No\n       2137(e)(4)--State requirements; nursing facility \n     administrator standards; adds requirement that hospital-based \n     administrators meet administrator standards. Same reasoning \n     as other issues where hospital-based facilities must meet \n     same requirements as free-standing.--No\n       2137(e)(5)--State requirements; specification of resident \n     assessment instrument; deletes current requirement that state \n     choose a resident assessment instrument designated by the \n     Secretary or approved by the Secretary as being consistent \n     with the minimum data set.--No\n       2137(e)(7)--State requirements; keeps preadmission \n     screening but deletes annual resident review. AHCA wanted \n     PASARR deleted.\n       2137(f)(l)--In current law, this establishes the \n     Secretary's duties. The new language makes this a state duty. \n     So current federal law which now says: ``It is the duty and \n     responsibility of the Secretary to assure that requirements \n     which govern the provision of care in nursing facilities . . \n     . and the enforcement of such requirements are adequate to \n     protect the health, safety, welfare, and rights of residents \n     and to promote the effective and efficient use of public \n     money.'' Is now changed to say ``It is the duty and \n     responsibility of a State with a MediGrant plan . . . .''\n       2137(f)(2)--Requirements for nurse aid training and \n     competency evaluation programs: This is Section (f), but it \n     is only a state duty under the new language. Specific \n     language from current law is deleted, as requested as AHCA, \n     but I can't read the language on my copy tonight.\n       Deletes federal requirements for transfer and discharge and \n     does not place the duty on states. 1396r(f)(3).\n       2137(f)(3)--Qualifications of administrators: adds language \n     to require hospital-based administrators to meet federal \n     standards.--Yes\n       Deletes current rules for Criteria for Administration, \n     which required the Secretary to establish rules for \n     administration in such areas as disaster preparedness, \n     direction of medical care by a physician, clinical records. \n     1396r(f)(5).--No\n\n[[Page S 17283]]\n\n       Deletes current rules for Criteria for Administration, \n     which required the Secretary to establish rules for \n     administration in such areas as disaster preparedness, \n     direction of medical care by a physician, clinical records. \n     1396r(f)(5).--No\n       Deletes List of items and services furnished in nursing \n     facilities not chargeable to the personal funds of a \n     resident. 1396r(f)(7). This language required the Secretary \n     to establish by rules which items and services are covered by \n     Medicaid and which items and services could be charged to \n     residents. As 1396r(f)(7)(A) explicitly says, Congress first \n     told the Secretary to publish such rules in 1977 as part of \n     the Medicare-Medicaid Anti-Fraud and Abuse Amendments of \n     1977. HCFA finally published these rules in 1992 or so. I can \n     get the exact date.--No\n       Deletes current language on PASARR. 1396r(f)(8).--Yes\n       Deletes current requirement re federal criteria for monitor \n     state waivers of nurse staffing requirements. 1396r(f)(9).--\n     No\n       2137(g)(1)(A)--Survey and certification: deletes \n     prohibition against states determining compliance with state \n     facilities.--Yes\n       Survey and certification: deletes requirement for \n     educational program for staff and residents and their \n     representatives. 1396r(g)(1)(B).--No\n       2137(g)(2)(A)(iii)(I)--Annual surveys: extends the time to \n     24 months (from 12 months) unless the facility has been \n     subjected to an extended survey.

Among \n     the damaging provisions included in the bill are amendments \n     to the Nursing Home Reform Act which would cripple the Act, \n     endanger nursing homes residents, and impoverish their \n     families.\n       The amendments in the Conference Report are merely another \n     tactic pursued by opponents of the nursing home reform act to \n     repeal those provisions. To place this effort in context, I \n     would remind you that as passed by the House and introduced \n     in the Senate, the reconciliation bills repealed the federal \n     standards. At introduction, the extreme proposals repealed \n     even protections against use of physical and chemical \n     restraints, spousal impoverishment, and training of nurse \n     aides. Only when the Senate voted to retain the Nursing Home \n     Reform Act, were the opponents of the protections for nursing \n     home residents turned aside in their effort to repeal the \n     standard.\n       In their new tactic, opponents of federal nursing homes \n     standards are attempting to repeal the standards by enacting \n     gutting amendments. For example, on quality of care, where \n     the current statute states that ``a nursing facility must \n     provide services and activities to attain or maintain the \n     highest practicable physical, mental, and psychosocial well \n     being of each resident in accordance with a written plan'', \n     the opponents have crafted an amendment in the conference \n     agreement that restates this provision to read ``a nursing \n     facility must provide services and activities in accordance \n     with a written plan''.\n       On training, current statutes require that workers \n     providing nursing or nursing related services be trained and \n     receive in-service education. The opponents' amendment would \n     allow all nursing facilities, regardless of the number of \n     civil penalties, deficiency reports, and demonstrated \n     substandard care incidents at the facility, to perpetuate \n     those problems by running their own nurse aide training \n     programs. In addition, the opponents' amendment excludes from \n     the training requirement ``any individual who is trained, \n     whether compensated or not, to perform a task-specific \n     function which assists residents in their daily activities''. \n     The opponents' amendment does not set standards for the \n     training, does not require continuing education, and does not \n     even require that the ``task-specific function'' performed by \n     the individual be the task for which they receive the \n     undefined training.\n       On spousal impoverishment, the opponents of federal \n     standards have scored one of their most tragic successes. \n     They have included a repeal of the provision that stated that \n     a ``nursing facility must not require a third party guarantee \n     of payment to the facility as a condition of admission (or \n     expedited admission) to, or continued stay in the facility''. \n     With this provision repealed, spouses and children can be \n     coerced by nursing homes to pay nursing home bills that \n     average $38,000 a year.\n       Finally, were any facility to be so incompetent that it \n     manages to violate the few shreds of remaining federal \n     standards, they will be saved from their own incompetency by \n     toothless enforcement provisions. The opponents of federal \n     standards have included verbatim amendments drafted by the \n     American Health Care Association. The nursing home industry's \n     amendments, as would be expected, strike language that allows \n     a state to ``provide for a civil money penalty for the days \n     in which it finds that the facility was not in compliance \n     with such requirements,'' which ``shall provide for the \n     imposition of incrementally more severe fines for repeated or \n     uncorrected deficiences'' and on and on and on.\n       We know from experience what happens when the Federal \n     government pulls out of nursing home regulation. Federal \n     regulation was minimal during the 1960s, `70s, and early \n     `80s, and the results were disastrous: Disabilities, \n     permanent injuries, and even premature death to nursing home \n     residents. The 1986 report of a national study commission \n     found that: ``In the past 15 years, many studies of nursing \n     home care have identified both grossly inadequate care and \n     abuse of residents.'' The Gingrich troops often talk as if \n     they are conducting an important experiment on the power of \n     free markets. When it comes to nursing homes, we've tried \n     this experiment before, and the tragic findings are burned in \n     our memory.\n       The Federal government jumped into nursing home regulation \n     because of abuses in the \n\n[[Page S 17284]]\n     industry. Incredibly, the Republicans propose to abandon oversight \n     activities at the same time that they begin squeezing nursing \n     home operators in a financial vise. About half of nursing \n     home revenues come from Medicaid, the program Speaker \n     Gingrich proposes to cut by over $160 billion. Nursing home \n     workers know well how corners are cut and how patient care \n     suffers when executives focus on cost reduction. Who will \n     protect patients and who will safeguard quality as nursing \n     home operators scramble to cope with massive revenue losses?\n       Future trends will also transform the type of care \n     delivered by nursing homes. Nursing homes will be caring for \n     people with more serious medical needs. A common strategy to \n     control health care costs involves moving patients out of \n     hospitals and into nursing homes--during surgical recovery, \n     for instance. One reason that nursing homes have been trusted \n     with such work is the Federal training standards for nursing \n     staff. Our workers tell us that this training has \n     substantially improved nursing home operations. The training \n     requirements must not be junked at a time when the home \n     population is getting sicker and requires more sophisticated \n     care.\n       Federal regulations are the lifeline protecting quality of \n     care for nursing home residents. Federal oversight helped \n     rescue us from a grim past. We must not ask nursing home \n     residents to give up that lifeline as we sail into a stormy \n     future.\n           Very truly yours,\n                                                  John J. Sweeney,\n                                          International President.\n\n  Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, finally, I never thought I would see the \nday of such an attempted emasculation of nursing home standards which \nwe fought so hard to protect. I never thought I would see it; never \nthought it would happen. I do not know why it is happening, but it is \nunbelievable that this Nation, the greatest Nation on the face of the \nEarth, with the full force and effect of the Republican-controlled \nSenate and the House, our Federal Government is about to wash its hands \nof the responsibility toward protecting 2 million seniors who today \nreside in American nursing homes.\n  While we have the basic safeguards of 1987, we are today basically \nwalking away from those safeguards and saying to that nursing home \nresident, ``We want no more to do with you. We are going to cut you \nadrift, and we are going to let you basically fend for yourself.''\n  Over Thanksgiving, I challenge my colleagues on the other side of the \naisle, or anyone who supports obliterating these standards, to go back \nto a nursing home in your State, to look those residents in the eye and \nto tell them how proud you are to have voted to compromise their safety \nand well-being and quality of life and walk away from the commitment \nthat we have had for almost a decade to protect their livelihood.\n  Mr. President, I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from \nTexas.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Thank you, Mr. President, and I thank the Senator \nfrom Michigan.\n  This afternoon late, a Mr. Don Shelby called our office. He was \ncalling from the St. Vincent de Paul Hospice in Austin, TX. He told me \nthat he had voted for me in the last election and that he would not be \nalive long enough to vote for me again, but he and the people in the \nhospice with him were so concerned about what is going on in Washington \nthat they collected $8 in change to go to a pay phone and call my \noffice.\n  And the message was this: ``Stick to your guns. I will not be around, \nbut I want to know when I die that my children are going to have a \nfuture.''\n  I want to say to Mr. Shelby and the people who contributed the $8 to \nmake that call, we will not let you down. We will not. We will stick to \nour guns. We will do what is right for this country, as hard as it may \nbe. We will do the right thing.\n  The people of this country have been promised for 25 years that the \npoliticians in Washington would balance the budget. Twenty-five years, \nand we have failed every year. This is our opportunity. This is our \nchance.\n  Always before people said, ``They'll never do it. The entitlements, \nit's too hard; they'll never do it.'' But we are doing it.\n  I have heard speeches on this floor all afternoon. ``Those radical \nRepublicans.'' Radical? Is it radical to keep a promise you made? Is it \nradical to run for an election in 1994 and promise the people that you \nwill balance the budget, that you will make the tough choices, no \nmatter the consequences and then keep that promise? I do not think so. \nIt is unusual, because people have been promised so many times in the \npast and the promises have not been kept. It is unusual to keep a \npromise, but I do not think it is radical, and I do not think the \nAmerican people do either.\n  We are going to pass tonight the Balanced Budget Act of 1995. It will \nbe the first time that the politicians in this country in 25 years have \nkept their promise. The President keeps talking about a balanced \nbudget, but he is doing what politicians have done for 25 years, and \nwhen it comes time to sign the dotted line, he is demurring, he is \nwalking away from his promise that he made in the election of 1992 and \nhe is saying, ``Oh, well, of course, I want a balanced budget, and I'm \ngoing to talk about it, but when it's presented to me, I'm not going to \nsign on.''\n  The people are not stupid. They do understand a promise kept, and \nthat is what is going to happen tonight. We are going to keep our \npromise to the homemakers of this country that they will have security \nand they will be able to contribute to IRA's just like those of us who \nwork outside the home can do, so that the one-income-earner couple that \nsacrifices so that the homemaker can stay home and raise children will \nhave the same retirement opportunities as if there had been two incomes \nearned for their families.\n  We are going to have welfare reform, and we are going to say to the \npeople who are out there working to make ends meet that it is worth it \nto work, because if able-bodied people can work but choose not to, they \nwill not be on the welfare wagon more than 5 years in their lifetime. \nFor the first time, we will put a lifetime limitation on able-bodied \nwelfare recipients.\n  And we are going to reform Medicaid. We are going to give it to the \nStates where they can run it more efficiently. We are going to save \nMedicare. We are going to save Medicare for our elderly. We are going \nto increase spending in Medicare over 7 percent per year. And we are \ngoing to slow that rate of growth from 10 percent so that we can save \nthe system--so that Mr. Shelby will know that it will be there for his \nchildren.\n  Mr. President, we may make a few mistakes. This is a big bill. We may \nnot do everything right. But there is one mistake that we cannot afford \nto make and that is to do nothing so that our children will inherit \nthis debt of $5 trillion.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. REID addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, on behalf of Senator Exon, I yield myself 5 \nminutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, it is interesting to note that since \nyesterday the name of this bill has changed. It is no longer the \nreconciliation bill. It is called something like the Balanced Budget \nAct of 1995. I am certain that the spin masters have said: All you good \nRepublicans, do not refer to this as reconciliation because the \nAmerican people do not like what they have heard.\n  I think rather than change the name to the Balanced Budget Act of \n1995, a more appropriate name would be maybe something like the End of \nRural Hospitals Act, or maybe you could come up with something like the \nGet Old People Act of 1995, or maybe Ruin the Environment Act of 1995, \nor maybe Destroy Education Act of 1995, or Punish the Veterans Act of \n1995, or maybe something even simpler like Save the Big Sugar Interests \nof the United States Act of 1995.\n  Mr. President, it is not all or nothing. You see, on this side of the \naisle, there are many people that believe in a balanced budget. In \nfact, most people do believe in a balanced budget amendment. The former \nchairman of the Budget Committee, the ranking member, the senior \nSenator from Nebraska, knows what balanced budgets are all about. He \nstarted talking about balanced budgets a long time ago when he \n\n[[Page S 17285]]\nwas Governor of the State of Nebraska. We have many people who believe \nin balanced budgets, but they believe in doing it in a fair way that \ndoes not hurt seniors, rural hospitals, the environment, damage \neducation, or punish veterans.\n  Mr. President, I think that we should recognize that the reason the \nname was changed overnight from ``reconciliation'' to the ``balanced \nbudget act of 1995,'' I repeat, is because the American public does not \nlike what they have heard in this reconciliation bill--this thousand-\npage bill we received a few minutes ago.\n  So this, Mr. President, is what the American people deserve, and that \nis a fair bill to balance the budget, which we want to do, also.\n  Mr. President, on anything that I have said to this point, the \nSenator from New Hampshire, Senator Gregg, I am sure would disassociate \nhimself with me. But what I am going to say now, he would associate \nhimself with me, and he has given me permission to do so. We have a \npoint of order that would lie against this bill, but we are not going \nto offer it. It is the Byrd rule point of order against the so-called \ntrigger provisions contained in a section of the act dealing with the \nsugar program. It is on the basis--on many bases, but there is no \nchange in outlays or revenues. We are not going to do that. But \neveryone should be aware that the Senator from Nevada and the Senator \nfrom New Hampshire are going to go after these sugar interests, which I \nbelieve, Mr. President, is one of the most damaging things that is in \nthis piece of legislation.\n  This legislation does nothing to help the family farmer. It hurts the \nfamily farmer. But what it does do is make a sweet deal for big sugar \ngrowers. As I said, this does not help the small family farmer. \nSeventeen cane growers get 58 percent of the benefits that come to all \ncane growers. One received more than $65 million--one person--in 1-\nyear; 33 growers received benefits of over a million dollars apiece a \nyear; in Florida, the number one State in sugar production, two growers \naccount for 75 percent of production.\n\n  So the U.S. Senate and the Congress should be advised that the \nSenator from Nevada and the Senator from New Hampshire are going to \nmake sure that the sugar program in the future is treated fairly, which \nit should be. The real losers in the Sugar Program that we have is the \nAmerican consumer, who pays a huge amount for their sugar and they \nshould not have to.\n  I yield the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from \nMontana.\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I thank my friend from Michigan.\n  This is probably a historical time for this body. The first time in \nmany years that we have had the opportunity to balance the budget, to \nput us on the trail to do something responsible. I remember the \nspeeches from the last 6 years and people saying, ``We believe in a \nbalanced budget, but look at all the pain; maybe we can do it next \nyear.'' Well, that next year has gone on for about 40 years and we kind \nof find ourselves in a pickle.\n  I had a wonderful woman that used to work in our office. She has \nsince transferred to Minneapolis with her husband, where he found a job \nopportunity, and they just had a brand-new baby. That is what this \ndebate is all about. It is about this young one in this picture, 3-days \nold, born 10/7/95, 7\\1/2\\ pounds, 21\\1/4\\ inches long. That is what it \nis all about, folks. To do anything different jeopardizes the future of \nthis young woman, this young lady right here in the picture. And it is \nbecause there are some of us who care to stand for maybe some very \nunpopular things right now, and take the responsibility, because we do \ncare for this young woman. We want to hand her a nation that is strong \neconomically and also strong politically.\n  This debate has gone on a long time. Everybody says, ``Well, you have \nto quit wrangling up there on the Hill. We do not like to be \nfurloughed.''\n  I just got a letter from a young woman in Winston, MT. It says: \n``Stop the talking, do something different. I want to have a nice \nThanksgiving and a Christmas.'' It is signed, ``Amanda Baum, Winston, \nMontana.''\n  Well, Amanda, it is a two-way street. We offered a continuing \nresolution that would let your father go back to work as soon as \npossible. But, you know, there is a person on the other end of \nPennsylvania avenue that said, no, I do not like that, so I am not \ngoing to sign it. So you are on furlough. But it takes two people. I \nsay change the message and call the House at the other end of \nPennsylvania Avenue.\n  In this Balanced Budget Act of 1995, there is a $500 per child tax \ncredit. What does that mean to your individual States? I will tell you \nwhat it means in Montana. The total number of returns eligible for a \ntax credit will be around 66,000 people. There are only 800,000 people \nin my whole State, but 66,000 returns will qualify for this $500 per \nchild tax credit. It will cover the amount of dependents of around \n98,000 people, and the value to the State of Montana is around $46 \nmillion. That is money in families' pockets. That is money that can be \nput in a savings account to buy a home. It is money that can be put in \na savings account that can pay for education for our young ones coming \nalong, and for those folks who want the responsibility of managing \ntheir own money.\n  So in this Balanced Budget Act, let us talk about some real things, \nlike capital gains that help us all.\n  No, we did not get all the AMT tax we wanted. Nonetheless, it does do \nsomething about depreciation--depreciation that creates jobs and \nexpands job opportunities. That is what is in this package. That is \nwhat we need. We have to expand job opportunities.\n  Economic development--my goodness, just the presence of the \nGovernment in your neighborhood is not economic development. We must \nproduce real growth, either manufacturing or the development of natural \nresources that provides natural wealth. It just does not start here in \nWashington.\n  I was taken aback a while ago when I saw the former Governor of \nArkansas worrying about the nursing home regulations. What is the \nmatter? Is this town the only one that has a conscience? He has no \nfaith in the State governments to regulate their nursing homes to the \nbenefit of our elderly?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  Mr. BURNS. I am in complete support of this package. I yield the \nfloor.\n  Mr. EXON. I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. I thank the distinguished Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. President, I am stunned that we still have to come to the floor \nto defend Medicare from the largest, most dangerous, most serious cut \never to surface since it was signed into law by President Johnson \nexactly 30 years ago.\n  Yes, this nightmare is not a dream. The budget plan on the Senate \nfloor this very minute aims its fire at Medicare for $270 billion in \ncuts over the 7 years. Guess what also survived the conference? A kitty \nof $245 billion of new tax breaks, new tax cuts, new tax relief that go \nto the wealthiest Americans and all kinds of corporations.\n  That is right. To the 30 million senior citizens counting on \nMedicare, to the disabled citizens counting on Medicare, it is still \nthe piggy bank for a whole lot of things that have nothing to do with \nMedicare and much more to do with tax breaks for the wealthy, tax \nincreases for working families, cuts in education, and the other \nfeatures of this budget plan now on the Senate for a final vote.\n  You do not need a graduate degree in mathematics to do the basic \narithmetic. Start with the proposition made by the Republican side of \nthe aisle--that Medicare must be cut to save the program, preserve it, \nkeep it solvent. But that is when you hit the brick wall. The trustees \nof the Medicare Part A Hospital Trust Fund say that $89 billion are \nneeded to extend the Fund's solvency until the year 2006. Not $270 \nbillion, $89 billion. That is a difference of $181 billion.\n  Why won't the Republicans listen to Medicare's trustees, and limit \nMedicare cuts to $89 billion so the program is solvent for 10 full \nyears? Because they're listening to the tune whistled on the steps of \nthe Capitol over a year ago, when the Contract for America was unfurled \nand $245 billion of tax breaks were promised.\n  Of course, none will admit that Medicare is being raided to pay for \ntax breaks for the rich. Who in their right \n\n[[Page S 17286]]\nmind would make that kind of confession?\n  But we do not need a confession. The mountain of evidence is right \nhere in this stack of paper that is the Republican budget plan called \nreconciliation. Medicare cuts of $270 billion or even more. Tax breaks \nof $245 billion. Case closed.\n  This $270 billion sounds like a huge cut because it is a huge cut. \nYou don't get $270 billion out of Medicare with a few nips here and a \nfew tucks there. Squeezing that much money out of Medicare means \nincreasing expenses for senior citizens, shrinking payments for \nhospitals and other providers, weakening Medicare's role in protecting \nagainst shoddy health care, and resorting to cheaper ways to pretend \nseniors will still get reliable health insurance. Make no mistake about \nit, $270 billion in Medicare cuts will hurt and will be noticed.\n\n  In fact, let us take an up-close look at just how the Republicans \ncame up with $270 billion in Medicare cuts to pay for tax breaks.\n  But first, maybe I need to start by reminding some people around here \njust how important Medicare is to a vast portion of the American \npopulation. No wonder Americans are more likely to say about Congress \nthey are scared to death than just angry.\n  It is Medicare that the phrase, crown jewels, should be reserved for. \nThe enactment of Medicare, as part of Social Security, was one of \nAmerica's great triumphs. When the country said its older and disabled \ncitizens would have health security for the first time in America's \nhistory, we took one of our greatest leaps as a nation. Before its \nenactment, less than half of this country's senior citizens had any \nkind of health insurance. An illness or accident or health problem \nwould immediately crush someone in their 60's or 70's or 80's, or wipe \nout his or her children and grandchildren.\n  That is why Medicare was created, fought over, and ultimately \nenacted. And it has worked. The 97 percent of America's seniors--30 \nmillion people--now can wake up every morning, knowing Medicare is \nthere. It has lifted seniors out of the poverty that the crushing costs \nof health care used to bear down on them. It has given them the peace \nof mind that they are not an overwhelming burden to their children and \ngrandchildren. It has given them the dignity to live the later years \nwithout the terror of what will happen to them if they fall or need \nsurgery.\n  Mr. President, we are talking about 30 million senior citizens whose \naverage income is less than $17,000. We are talking about 330,115 \nsenior citizens in West Virginia whose average income is around \n$10,000. We are talking about older Americans who already spend one-\nfifth of these meager incomes on health care expenses that are not \ncovered by Medicare--which include Medicare premiums and deductibles, \nprescription drugs, eyeglasses, certain tests, home care, and the list \ngoes on.\n  And we are not just talking about Medicare's meaning for senior \ncitizens in West Virginia or Massachusetts or California. It is the \nsame for seniors in Kansas, in Texas, name your State. We are talking \nabout people with average incomes of $24,000 pay a fifth of their \nincomes on health care already, who are about the only Americans that \nhave health care protection that cannot be taken away.\n\n  Until today. Until we see this incredible budget plan that still \ntakes $270 billion from Medicare, not to mention the $170 or $180 \nbillion from Medicare. Not to save Medicare, but to come up with $245 \nbillion in tax breaks for people with incomes far, far higher than \n$24,000 a year.\n  Now it is time to talk about just exactly how this budget gets $270 \nbillion out of Medicare.\n  It starts with a plan the whole country got a special education in \nthis week--because it was even attached to the bill that is only \nsupposed to ensure the Federal Government can operate.\n  It starts with a plan the whole country got a special education in \nthis week--because it was even attached to the bill that is only \nsupposed to ensure the Federal Government can operate.\n  I am talking about a Medicare premium increase. It may have been \nstripped from the continuing resolution, but it is back. This budget \nincreases Part B premiums for seniors by $11 a month--adding up to an \nextra $1,240 for individual seniors over the next 7 years and an extra \n$2,480 per couple on Medicare. That is on top of everything else they \nare already spending on health care.\n  There is plenty more.\n  Remember the BELT idea when we had the Senate reconciliation bill on \nthe floor a few weeks ago? It is gone in name, but not in spirit.\n  Obviously, $270 billion in cuts means a lot less money for payments \nto doctors, hospitals, labs, and other health care services. But what \nhappens if the targets in this budget are missed? Well, before, the \nBELT was whipped out, and it was actually called that in the Senate \nbill. Now it has been given a more subtle name, but it's still plenty \nlethal. It is called the lookback--this budget tells the Secretary of \nHealth and Human Services that he or she will have to make last-minute, \nextra, surprise cuts in Medicare payments if for some reason all the \ncuts made before didn't go deep enough. This budget has to have this \nkind of last-minute Medicare guillotine built in. This budget has to \nget $270 billion out of Medicare, no matter what, or there won't be \n$245 billion to dole out in tax breaks.\n  It goes on and on, Mr. President. Changes, cuts, setbacks, weakening \nof standards--it is all here to cut Medicare by $270 billion.\n  In this budget, senior citizens are supposed to fend for themselves. \nBefore this budget, they were protected from balance billing when they \nbrought private insurance plans. But in this Republican budget, the \nprice gouging can start again.\n  Before this budget, there were Federal standards to make sure tests \ndone in the labs located in the doctors' office were accurate and \nreliable. But in the Republican budget, the salespitches will start \nexploding. Medicare vouchers for managed care will be waved around, \nluring seniors into managed care and locking them in for 1 year. I can \nhear the telemarketers and advertisers writing the scripts, the \njingles, and hiding the fine print--because here we come, Medical \nSavings Accounts. With this Republican budget, Medical Savings Accounts \nwill be targeted, you can count on it, at the healthier seniors, \ndriving up costs for everyone else and for the Medicare Program, and \ndriving doctors away from accepting seniors.\n  Mr. President, there are consequences to $270 billion of Medicare \ncuts. Ask the hospitals of your State. Listen to the senior citizens \nwhose premiums and deductibles will go up.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \na letter that denounces the Republican plan.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record as follows:\n\n                 America's Hospitals and Health Systems\n\n                                                November 17, 1995.\n     Hon. John D. Rockefeller IV,\n     Hart Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Rockefeller: The undersigned national, state \n     and metropolitan organizations, representing more than 5,000 \n     hospitals and health systems nationwide, cannot support the \n     conference report on H.R. 2491, the budget reconciliation \n     bill. Our reason is straightforward: as it stands, this \n     legislation, viewed in its entirety, is not in the best \n     interest of patients, communities and the men and women who \n     care for them.\n       Hospitals and health systems support the stated goals of \n     the conference report--a balanced budget, a strengthened \n     Medicare trust fund and restructured, more efficient Medicare \n     and Medicaid programs. In fact, we have offered several \n     concrete and reasonable alternatives to achieve these goals \n     without significantly reducing the quality or availability of \n     patient care. For the most part, these alternatives were \n     rejected.\n       In this long budget debate, America's hospitals and health \n     systems have been guided by principles based on ensuring good \n     patient care now and in the future:\n       The health care protection for our nation's most vulnerable \n     populations--the elderly, the poor, the disabled and millions \n     of children--is inadequate.\n       The tools which could enable hospitals and health systems \n     to continue to provide high quality care to beneficiaries in \n     the new Medicare marketplace are insufficient. The necessary \n     tools were included in the House-passed Medicare Preservation \n     Act, but were significantly diluted during the conference \n     process.\n       We have consistently stated that the budget reductions in \n     Medicaid and Medicare remain too deep and happen too fast. \n     Hospitals and health systems are willing to shoulder a fair \n     share of the reductions needed for a balanced budget. But the \n     reductions in the conference report will jeopardize the \n     ability of \n\n[[Page S 17287]]\n     hospitals and health systems to deliver quality care, not just to those \n     who rely on Medicare and Medicaid, but to all Americans.\n       Although we cannot support the conference report, we stand \n     ready to work with Congress and the Administration on a fair \n     approach to reducing spending, balancing the budget and \n     protecting the availability and quality of patient care.\n           Sincerely,\n                                      Signed by 84 hospital plans.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from \nKansas.\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM. Mr. President, I rise to strongly support the \nlegislation before us, the Balanced Budget Act of 1995, because I think \nit reflects sound budget and policy priorities that will be of enormous \nbenefit to this Nation through the next century.\n  This is really what it is about, trying to lay out a roadmap that is \ngoing to provide change, provide flexibility, provide initiative, that \ncan give us a strong program to carry us through the years and for the \nnext generation to come and generations after that.\n  There may be some concerns about this turn or that turn. It is an \nenormous package of very important initiatives. I have great \nconfidence, Mr. President, that we can make it work, and it will \nrequire the best efforts of all on both sides of the aisle and working \nwith our State legislatures and our communities to see it is \naccomplished.\n  I would like to speak briefly about two parts of this package that I \nhave been most directly involved in. One is student loans. This \nlegislation includes $4.955 billion in savings in Federal student loan \nprograms over the 7 years. Earlier today, the ranking member of the \nLabor and Human Resources Committee and colleague from Massachusetts, \nSenator Kennedy, said these provisions would help banks and guaranty \nagencies at the expense of students.\n  I just point out, indeed, that is not the case. Seventy percent of \nthe savings are achieved by reducing subsidies to or imposing new fees \non banks and guaranty agencies. None of the savings are achieved by \nincreasing costs to students or their parents.\n  It is very important that this is understood in the public where a \nmessage has been put out that is totally erroneous about the effects on \nstudents. The remaining 30 percent of savings are achieved by capping \nthe direct loan program at 10 percent of loan volume. This would not \nchange the level of the loan or the amount of the loan. A direct \nlending program may mean the students may get their loan money more \nquickly, but it does not have any effect on the amount or interest \nrates of those loans.\n  In addition, the bill makes income-contingent repayment of student \nloans available to all students, not just those participating in the \ndirect loan program. I remain concerned about the risk that the direct \nloan program poses to taxpayers. That is why I believe Congress is \nbeing fiscally responsible by demanding to see how it works before \nexpanding it.\n  I do not believe the Department of Education should become the third \nlargest consumer lender in the country. That, indeed, is where it is \nheaded if we go to a full, direct lending program on student loans, \nconsequences which I think need to be carefully thought out and \nreviewed.\n  Mr. President, I also wish to speak about the child care provisions \nin this bill. I am pleased that we have, I think, some very strong \nchild care provisions. The bill combines $10 billion in mandatory \nspending and $7 billion in discretionary spending into a consolidated \nsystem for providing child care for children from low-income families, \nincluding those working their way off welfare.\n  This is over 7 years. Again, I think when we recognize that 70 \npercent of the mandatory funds are to be used for families making the \ntransition from welfare to work and for those at risk of going on \nwelfare, and a substantial portion of the remaining funds must be used \nto help low-income working families who are not and have not been on \nwelfare to meet their child care needs as they are, indeed, struggling \nto stabilize themselves in the workplace.\n  Equally important, the bill recognizes we cannot ask parents to leave \nchildren home alone as a condition of receiving welfare. Therefore, \nwelfare families with a demonstrated need for child care may not be \nsanctioned for failing to meet work requirements in States that do not \noffer child care assistance.\n  We need to break a cycle of dependency on welfare, but we need to do \nit by protecting children and having children have the stability of \nknowing they are cared for, are wanted and loved in an environment that \nwill help them succeed. I believe we do that by strong child care \nprovisions which really help families begin to move off the welfare \nrolls.\n  I think there are some very positive provisions. I urge colleagues' \nsupport for this legislation and thank all those who played a major \nrole in drafting and working on this legislation.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from \nMaryland.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, first, I commend the distinguished \nSenator from Nebraska, the ranking member on the Budget Committee, for \nhis very fine leadership throughout this budget debate. We are deeply \nappreciative to him for his extraordinary efforts.\n  Mr. President, the basic fact is that drastic cuts are being made in \nMedicare, Medicaid, basic health programs, in nutrition programs to \nnourish our young people, school lunch, school breakfast, food stamps, \nin educational programs which make it possible for young people to go \nto college, and in environmental programs to protect clean air and \nclean water. These deep cuts are necessitated by the burning mania on \nthe part of the Republicans, as part of the budget package, to give tax \nbreaks to wealthy people. Make no mistake about it, that is the \nconnection. If the tax breaks were not in this package, these drastic \ncuts would be ameliorated to a significant degree. Then you could argue \nabout reducing the deficit and how you go about doing it in terms of \nspending cuts. But the problem is compounded in this package because \nthere is a burning mania on the other side to give tax breaks to \nwealthy people.\n  Kevin Phillips, 2 days ago, in an interview on the radio said:\n\n       Under the camouflage of deficit reduction and cuts like \n     those in Medicare and Medicaid, the new budget includes \n     dozens of new and enlarged tax breaks, loopholes, and \n     corporate welfare programs. The tax cuts for ordinary \n     Americans are peanuts, but the special deals are big stuff.\n\n  And he goes on to say:\n\n       It is doubly impolitic to drive the budget deficit down to \n     zero by cutting medical, educational, and entitlement \n     programs while corporate and upper-bracket tax breaks \n     continue to soar.\n\n  That is what is happening here. We are hearing talk about, ``Oh, we \nare going to protect the next generation and our children.'' What about \nthe children today, who are going to be sent into the next generation \nstunted because the nutrition programs have been cut, the health \nprograms have been cut, the education programs have been cut? What \nabout young men and women who will not get the chance for a college \neducation because of the cutbacks contained in this package, at the \nvery same time that people at the upper-income brackets are getting \nlarge and significant tax breaks?\n  There is obviously a hidden agenda contained in this budget package. \nThe Speaker of the House let it out of the bag a few days ago when, \nspeaking to a group, he said:\n\n       Now let me talk about Medicare. We don't get rid of it in \n     round 1, because we don't think that would be politically \n     smart.\n       We don't get rid of it in round 1, because we don't think \n     that would be politically smart.\n\n  So, it is going to come in round 2 and in round 3. They assert they \nare protecting Medicare and right here is evidence that it is the \nbeginning of the end of Medicare. We have Republican leaders who boast \nabout the fact that they opposed Medicare when it was put into place, \nand then they try to make us believe they are out to protect Medicare. \nMedicare is being cut deeply, again to give these tax breaks.\n  The fact of the matter is--and this is my judgment--part of this \nhidden agenda is a major shift of benefits, economic benefits in this \ncountry, from ordinary people, from middle-income people to the very \nwealthy. If you assert this the other side says, ``Oh, it is class \nwarfare.'' The class warfare is being waged by those who are reaping \nthe benefits disproportionately in this society. \n\n[[Page S 17288]]\n\n  They say, ``Oh, don't do class warfare.'' In the meantime, the \nstatistics show--and listen to these statistics----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Will the ranking member yield me 2 additional minutes?\n  Mr. EXON. I yield my colleague 1 additional minute.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Listen to these statistics.\n  Federal Reserve figures from 1989, the most recently available, show \nthat the richest 1 percent of American households, with net worth of at \nleast $2.3 million each, have nearly 40 percent of the Nation's \nwealth--1 percent of American households, 40 percent of the Nation's \nwealth. The top 20 percent of American households worth $180,000 or \nmore, have 80 percent of the country's wealth--80 percent.\n  The income statistics are equally skewed. The lowest-earning 20 \npercent of Americans earn 5.7 percent of the after-tax income. The top \n20 percent of American households have 55 percent of the after-tax \nincome.\n  The United States is now the most unequal industrialized country, in \nterms of income and wealth, and we are growing more unequal faster than \nthe other industrialized countries. And this package is going to \nintensify that trend.\n  Make no mistake about it, that is what this package will do. It is \nshifting benefits from lower-income and working people to the upper end \nof the scale.\n  People on Medicare, earning $15,000 a year, are going to suffer in \norder to give a tax break to the very wealthy.\n  I urge the rejection of this package.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. I yield myself such time as I need briefly, and then I \nwill yield to the Senator from Minnesota.\n  As I said several times here today, apparently in some parts of this \ncountry people making less than $75,000 a year are ``the most wealthy \nAmericans.'' In my State that is not the case. Mr. President, 65 \npercent of the tax cuts contained in this package will go to people and \nfamilies making less than $75,000 a year. Mr. President, 80 percent \nwill go to people whose families make less than $100,000 a year. In \nMichigan, those people are not wealthy people. Maybe they are in other \nparts of America, but people making less than $75,000 are not wealthy \npeople in my State.\n  As to the so-called tax cuts for wealthy, I point out as I have \nalready numerous times in relationship to this bill, there are $26 \nbillion in loophole closings contained in this legislation, closing \nloopholes on these so-called wealthiest Americans, individuals and \ncorporations, which largely offsets whatever tax cuts might benefit \npeople in those categories.\n  Finally, with regard to students, we should point out to the students \nwatching that, as Senator Kassebaum indicated earlier, regarding the \nstudent loan program insofar as it affects students, the volume of \nloans remain unabated, at levels that have always been out there, and \nthere are no changes in the cost of loans to students. Moreover, there \nare further provisions in the bill that will actually provide students \nwith student loans with the opportunity to deduct interest they pay on \nthose loans. In fact, it places people in a stronger position.\n  That said, Mr. President, at this time, I yield five minutes to the \nSenator from Minnesota.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota is recognized.\n  Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I rise with great pride today in support of \nthe Balanced Budget Act of 1995.\n  I hear a lot of talk from the other side of the aisle about cuts. The \nmajor cuts are going to be in Washington's ability to take more of the \ntaxpayers' money. The hidden agenda is a balanced budget and a brighter \nfuture. And, if there has been a growing gap of wealth, it has occurred \nunder Democratic programs, and it is time to change that.\n  This bill, more than anything else, is about promises--making \npromises, and keeping promises.\n  The American people have every reason to be cynical about political \npromises.\n  Yet something resonated with the voters when we went to the people \nlast November and promised we would take this country in a better \ndirection if they elected a new majority to Congress.\n  We laid out a plan for the Nation's future unlike anything the people \nhad been promised over the last 40 years.\n  The legislation before us today is proof that there is a better way--\nand the vision it reflects is based on two fundamental promises we made \nto the voters: First, we promised we would balance the budget in 7 \nyears. And second, we promised we would cut taxes for working-class \nfamilies.\n  Mr. President, the centerpiece of the legislation before us is our \npromise to balance the budget by the year 2002.\n  If you want to know why 83 percent of the American public say \nbalancing the budget should be the top priority of this Congress, these \nstatistics speak volumes: Every year, the Federal Government is \nspending billions and billions more than it takes in. As a result of \nfour decades of fiscal insanity, the national debt today stands at \nnearly $5 trillion. Every child born today in the United States of \nAmerica comes into this world already saddled with more than $19,000 in \ndebt.\n  So the first, most important result of a balanced budget would be to \nfree our children and grandchildren from the economic burden they will \ninherit from this generation--a burden they did not ask for, and \ncertainly do not deserve.\n  Ask an economist about the other benefits of a balanced budget, and \nthey will reel off an impressive list of reasons why we ought to move \nforward.\n  By the time 7 years have passed and the budget is brought into \nbalance: GDP will grow by an additional $10.8 billion; interest rates \nwill drop, and Americans will boost their spending power through an \nadditional $32.1 billion in disposable income; the buyers of a $100,000 \nhome would save more than $10,000 over the life of a 30-year mortgage; \nan additional 104,000 family homes would be built and 600,000 more \nautomobiles would be sold; and businesses would be empowered to create \nnew and higher paying jobs--as many as an additional 6.1 million new \njobs, by some estimates.\n  Impressive statistics, but what does all this really mean on Main \nStreet?\n  Well, for an average American family with two kids, a mortgage \npayment, car and student loans, a dog and a cat and lot of monthly \nbills, a balanced Federal budget would put at least $1,800 a year back \ninto the family bank account.\n  That is a pretty good incentive for passing a balanced budget in \n1995: save money and get a tax break, because we have also promised to \ncut taxes for middle-class families--another promise we are keeping \nwith this legislation.\n  This Congress is no longer willing to let the Government gamble away \nthe taxpayers' hard-earned dollars as if they belonged to Washington. \nIn fact, we are going to keep those dollars out of the Government's \nhands in the first place.\n  The centerpiece of our $245-billion tax relief package is the $500 \nper-child tax credit, and I am proud that my colleagues stood with my \ngood friend, Senator Abraham, and I to ensure that this desperately \nneeded provision remains at the heart of our balanced budget plan.\n  The tax credit alone will allow 28 million taxpaying households to \nkeep $23 billion of their own money each year.\n  In my home State of Minnesota, the tax credit would return $477 \nmillion annually to families who work hard, pay their bills, and \nstruggle every day to care for their children without relying on the \nGovernment.\n  In addition, 3.5 million households nationwide will find that the \n$500 per-child tax credit has completely eliminated their tax \nliability.\n  With our Balanced Budget Act, this Congress has kept the solemn \npromises we made to the American people. Yet without even waiting for \nthe bill to arrive at his desk, President Clinton is promising to veto \nit and stop the balanced budget in its tracks.\n  The President says he wants a balanced budget--wants it \nwholeheartedly, he claims. Balancing the budget was one of the central \nthemes of his 1992 campaign, and I remember when he said: ``I'll tell \nyou why you should vote for me. I know how to balance a budget. I've \nbalanced 11 budgets as Governor of Arkansas. One of the \n\n[[Page S 17289]]\nfirst things I'll do when I get to Washington is send Congress a \nbalanced budget.''\n  Of course, that turned out to be a pie-crust promise--easily made, \neasily broken.\n  Since taking office nearly 3 years ago, Bill Clinton has never \npresented Congress with a budget that balances--or comes anywhere \nclose, for that matter.\n  In the last two plans he has dropped on the Capitol doorstep, the \ndeficit hovers around $200 billion every year, far, far into the \nfuture.\n  And we voted on both of those plans here on the floor of the U.S. \nSenate. Both failed 99 to zero, and these are the plans that the \nPresident brags about.\n  Mr. President, Congress is going to balance the budget because we \npromised the American people we would.\n  We are going to cut taxes because we promised the American people we \nwould.\n  We are going to turn this Government around and start putting it to \nwork on behalf of the taxpayers because we promised the American people \nwe would.\n  ``The Man from Hope'' is quickly earning the reputation around here \nas ``the Man from Hope Not.'' He says he wants a balanced budget, but \nhe secretly hopes he'll never have to sign one.\n  Mr. President, Bill Clinton cannot continue to say in public that he \nsupports a balanced budget, tax cuts, and welfare reform, and then \nreturn to the private confines of the Oval Office to veto every piece \nof legislation that would bring the budget into balance, cut taxes, and \nreform welfare.\n  My colleagues and I have great dreams for this Nation and its \nchildren, Mr. President, and the American people are counting on us to \nheed the words of the great Winston Churchill and ``never, never, never \ngive up.''\n  With a balanced budget at stake and the future of this Nation at \nstake along with it, this Congress has no intention of giving up and \nturning our backs on this moment in history.\n  That is a promise.\n  Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from \nWashington.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Thank you, Mr. President.\n\n\n                        ten thanksgiving stories\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, next Thursday, families from Forks, WA to \nFort Lauderdale, FL will be coming together to enjoy each other's \ncompany and to celebrate a holiday unique to the history and heritage \nof our country.\n  The tables will be heaped with food, prepared in many kitchens and \nbrought together at the house of one family. For some families in our \ncountry, who do not necessarily have all that much to be thankful for, \nthis may be the best meal of the year.\n  If your family is at all like mine, there will be turkey and gravy \nand some kind of Jello salad. At dinner, there will be a card table for \nthe little kids, and a couple of bigger kids who will not want to sit \nwith them.\n  After dinner, there will be games of Pinochle. There will be \nteenagers standing around, wishing something exciting would happen. \nThere will be people in the living room, just starting to get sleepy. \nThe television will be on, and the Detroit Lions will be losing again. \nAnd best of all, throughout the day, there will be many stories.\n  The people in my life tell stories about many things. Stories about \nfamily members who could not come this year or family members who have \ndied. Stories about war. Stories about work or friends or sports. \nStories about a new birth, or an impending marriage. In most years, \nthere is not much talk about government--unless something really bad is \nabout to happen.\n  I have a feeling I am going to hear a lot of talk about government \nthis year. Right now, I can almost hear 10 stories that might be told \naround the tables at Thanksgiving this year, across this great land. \nTen things people wish they did not have to talk about, but they will:\n  First, there will be the story about Medicare. The elders always tell \nstories best, remember the bad times clearest, and complain about the \nGovernment loudest. Next Thursday, after grace has been said, an old \nman is going to pause, with the mashed potato spoon still in his hand, \nand say ``You hear what they're going to do to Medicare?''\n  This story, like the rest, is a sad one. The man knows that the \nbudget needs to be balanced for the generations he can see around the \ntable. He has heard that there has been fraud and abuse in Medicare \nbilling. He knows that he is going to have to sacrifice for the \nbetterment of the country. He just is not going to understand why \nCongress is going to take more money out of his Social Security check \nto give a tax break to people who do not need it.\n  Second, there will be the story about Medicaid. The family is \ntogether, but they have to arrange to visit grandma at the nursing \nhome. The family will go visit, but they will now have to worry about \nwhether Congress is going to allow States to gut nursing home standards \nthat protect grandma's health, safety, and financial security.\n  They will have to worry about whether grandma will be the lucky one \nto get Medicaid funding when their State has to choose between paying \nfor pregnant women, children, the elderly, or the disabled, because \nCongress gave them less money to meet the growing needs they face.\n  Third, there will be the story of the adult children in the family, \nwho never before had to worry about being held responsible for the \ncosts of grandma's nursing home care, but now will. They have worked \nhard to raise their own family, save money for their kid's education, \nand for their own retirement. Now they will have to deal with extra \ncosts from every angle.\n  If they are working but low income, they will not get the $500 per \nchild tax credit that the Congress is touting, because they will not \npay enough taxes to get the deduction. If they do not have children \nyet, they will face the fact that Congress will be taking away the \nearned income tax credit they have counted on.\n  If they do have kids, and do get the tax credit, they are going to \nneed the money. Because when grandma cannot stay in the nursing home \nbecause Congress cut Medicaid, the family is going to have to build a \nnew room onto the house.\n  Fourth, there will be the college-age students and their story. They \nwant to prepare themselves for a world where they know they will have \nto be qualified to compete. They are willing to swallow their pride and \nask their parents for help; they are willing to work; and they are \nwilling to pay off loans after college. But none of that will matter.\n  The Congress is going to take $5 billion out of their student loan \nprograms, and give it to the banks. Congress is going to decimate the \nDirect Lending Program, which gives students their money more \nefficiently, and eliminates bureaucracy and the middle man. In addition \nthe budget eliminates Perkins loan funding and drops 280,000 students \nfrom Pell grants.\n  Fifth, there will be the story of the younger students, who need to \nhave a relevant public education to get them ready to go on to college, \ninto some other form of training, or directly into work. For these \nstudents, the Congress is going to cut almost $4 billion from \ndiscretionary but vital education programs, including title I basic \nskills instruction for 500,000 additional students, State student \nincentive grants, school reform, Head Start, and AmeriCorps.\n  Sixth, there will be one of the most tragic stories of all--the story \nof what will happen to all the children in the great country of ours. \nServices to help children, from Medicaid to pay their medical bills, to \nschool lunch and day-care nutrition programs, to childhood \nimmunizations are all going under the ax in what the majority party is \npainting as some kind of epic and heroic moment in American history.\n  These cuts will certainly be historic. This is probably the first \ntime in history that the American Government declared war on its own \nchildren, when it knew better. If the Congress wants to balance the \nbudget, American families are all for it. But Americans are pretty \nsteadfast when their own family is threatened, and this is a battle \nthat the majority party in Congress should lose.\n  Seventh, there will be the story of the welfare mom. This member of \nthe \n\n[[Page S 17290]]\nfamily may not be sitting at your table this year, but she comes to \nmany homes for Thanksgiving, and her sisters may one day come to your \ntable or mine. Her story is one of tragedy piled on top of tragedy.\n  Maybe she came from an abusive marriage, where she took beating after \nbeating, and only got out after her abuser started hitting her kids. \nShe probably did not have the benefit of education and training. She \nmost likely had all kinds of things stacked against her. Invest in her \nlife now, with child care and training, and she'll be a tax-paying \ncitizen for years to come.\n  But this Congress is going to cut child care, nutrition services, and \nkick this woman off public assistance as fast as possible, without the \nsupport that would allow her to join the work force. She does not have \nmuch to be thankful for with the passage of this budget.\n  Eighth, there will be a story about the environment. A 12-year-old \nmay ask why the Government wants to sell her heritage to big companies. \nShe wonders about the polar bears and caribou that now live in the \nArctic National Wildlife Refuge.\n  She asks whether the Native people she has read about, or whether her \nfamily, if she happens to be a member of Gwich'n tribe, will be able to \ncontinue to live where they have lived for 20,000 years--on the lands \nthey love, subsisting on a now-abundant supply of wildlife. She sighs \nand asks her elders not to sell America's lands, our national forests, \nour national refugees, our national treasures--her heritage.\n  Ninth, there will be the story of the family farm. The wheat farmer \nfrom eastern Washington, who has seen congressional Republicans adopt a \nFreedom to Farm Proposal that couldn't even be approved by the House or \nthe Senate. The wheat farmer, who has seen the safety net for farmers \neliminated, the safety net that has existed for almost 60 years.\n  Farmers do not need this safety net when prices are good, but when \nprices are bad, these farmers, who supply the staple foods of our \nsociety, need our support. They deserve our support. The family farmer, \nwho works to grow the food that provides the bounty for Thanksgiving \ndinners for families across our Nation--this farmer is forgotten in the \nRepublican budget.\n  Tenth, the last story, will be a story of real thanks. After all \nthese other stories, after the eyes roll skyward, after the anger, \nafter the frustration, they will all join hands and give thanks. The \nmembers of this family will thank their God that they are all together \nfor the holiday. They will be thankful for the good food and warmth of \nfamily, but mostly, they will be very thankful that the Members of \nCongress are also home with their families, and not doing more damage \nfrom the floors of the House and Senate.\n  Mr. President, I continue to worry about the priorities in this \nbudget. We all know this budget will be vetoed; for that I am thankful. \nWhen it is returned, I intend to work very hard with my colleagues to \nensure we will then pass a budget that is good for our children, our \nfamilies, and our future.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from \nTennessee.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I rise in support of the Balanced Budget \nAct of 1995.\n  The American people have been watching the debate over the continuing \nresolution this week, and based on the calls that have come into my \noffice, they recognize that this debate is about one thing: whether or \nnot we will have a balanced budget.\n  After President Clinton was elected, he used his promise to balance \nthe budget as an excuse to raise taxes. Today, all Americans have \nhigher taxes, but they still do not have a balance budget.\n  Contrary to what he says, the President has never proposed a balanced \nbudget of his own. His latest plan, which he says will balance the \nbudget in 9 or 10 years, would actually result in deficits of more than \n$200 billion as far as the eye can see--including a deficit of $209 \nbillion in 2005, the year President Clinton claims he would eliminate \nthe deficit.\n  The President's budget is so phony that no Democrat in Congress would \neven introduce it for a vote in the House or Senate. When a Republican \nSenator introduced it, it was defeated 96-0.\n  While Clinton talks about a balanced budget, Republicans have done \nthe heavy lifting, and made the hard decisions necessary to get it \ndone. Our plan is certified by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget \nOffice, which President Clinton himself has said is the sole authority \non budget authenticity.\n  With the continuing resolution passed yesterday and the plan before \nthe Senate today, Republicans continue to show their unwavering \ncommitment to a balanced budget. The President as a candidate promised \nto balance the budget in 5 years. All we are asking for is 7 years. \nRepublicans honestly believed, and some of us are holding out hope, \nthat President Clinton will show some leadership and help us balance \nthe budget.\n  He has promised to balance the budget in 5 years, then 10 years, then \n9 years, then 8 years, and as recently as October 19, the President \nsaid that he thought we could reach a balanced budget in 7 years. But \nhe rejected yesterday's continuing resolution, and he will likely veto \nthis bill. The President is not committed to balancing the budget. He \nis committed to increasing spending and an ever growing Federal \nGovernment.\n  The plan before us today fulfills our promises to the American \npeople. It will:\n  Balance the budget in 7 years,\n  End welfare as we know it,\n  Save and strengthen Medicare, and,\n  Reduce taxes in a way that provides relief to families with children, \nstimulates growth, and generates jobs.\n  The bottom line is this: the future of our Nation depends upon \nwhether we have the courage to balance the budget.\n  Our current path--if we do nothing--leads to:\n  Uncontrolled federal spending and borrowing, and skyrocketing annual \ndeficits--$200 to $300 billion by the year 2000, and higher deficits \nthereafter.\n  In fact the deficit increases $335,000 every minute--which means that \nit has increased roughly $1 million in just the amount of time that I \nhave been speaking on the Senate floor.\n  Another $1.2 trillion added to our national debt between now and the \nyear 2000--which will bring the total surging past $6.7 trillion by the \nturn of the century;\n  A Medicare program that goes broke; a Medicaid program that doubles \nin size;\n  An enormous and unsustainable tax burden on young workers who will be \nforced to pay 82-percent of their wages in taxes to support prolific \nfederal spending; and\n  The first generation of Americans in our Nation's history to have \nfewer opportunities than their parents.\n  And yet, if we do balance the budget, if we are able to impose fiscal \ndiscipline on the massive federal bureaucracy, the benefits are very \nreal, and the possibilities are endless for our prosperity as a Nation.\n  According to the Joint Economic Committee, a family with a $75,000 \ncar loan and an $11,000 student loan could save $1,771 a year if \ninterest rates drop another percentage point under the Republican plan, \nand $2,828 a year if interest rates return to the levels of the 1950s.\n  According to the economic forecasting firm of DRI McGraw-Hill, if we \nbalance the budget by the year 2002, the gross domestic product will be \n$170 billion higher than without a balanced budget. That represents a \n2.5 percent increase in productivity for businesses, and about $1,000 \nper household higher standard of living for families.\n  And even Wall Street is responding positively to the current \nsituation, closing at a record 4969, while the 30 year Treasury bill \nrate fell to 6.23%. If Congress fails to pass a balanced budget plan, \nthen the American people should be scared, because the markets will \nlose faith in the U.S. government.\n  All this is possible by only slowing the growth of federal spending. \nUnder the Republican plan, spending on Medicare, Medicaid, welfare, \nfood stamps, the Earned Income Tax Credit, student loans, you name it, \nwill continue to grow, only at a slower rate.\n  As James Glassman said in a recent editorial in the Washington Post:\n\n       If Congress' budget becomes law, the social compact will \n     actually be strengthened. Not \n\n[[Page S 17291]]\n     only will the government keep its commitments to the elderly and the \n     poor on health care, it will also meet an even more important \n     obligation to the public that is abrogated 30 years ago--to \n     spend no more than it takes in.\n\n  The Republican plan is a credible, reasonable and truly historic plan \nto reverse the excessive spending of the past, while continuing to \nprovide a sturdy safety net for the poorest Americans. The plan will \nsave and strengthen Medicare, transform the Medicaid and Welfare \nprograms and produce unprecedented economic growth for generations to \ncome. I strongly support the Balanced Budget Act of 1995 and urge its \npassage.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. ROBB addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. ROBB. On behalf of the Democratic manager, I yield myself 4 \nminutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized for 4 minutes.\n  Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, I rise to oppose the budget reconciliation \nbill before the Senate. I do not oppose the Republican budget because \nit is projected to balance the unified budget by 2002, because I \nbelieve we can and should balance the budget over that time period. I \noppose this budget because I believe it is the wrong way to reconcile \nspending and revenues.\n  Instead of a bipartisan consensus, it reflects a too narrow, \nideological agenda that does not represent the best long-term interests \nof the country. And I know that the leadership on both sides of the \naisle, at least in this body, can and would like to do better.\n  I have no doubt that my good friend and colleague, Senator Domenici, \nif not constrained by some Members of his own party, mostly in the \nother body, would develop a more responsible, more bipartisan budget. \nAs a Democrat who supported both the original Senate budget resolution \nlast May and the continuing resolution last night that committed us to \na balanced budget by 2002, using CBO numbers, which we may revisit \nshortly, I have always been ready to work with Presidents of both \nparties and in Congresses having both Democratic and Republican \nmajorities on a bipartisan basis to solve the long-term fiscal \nchallenges facing our Nation.\n  Unfortunately, this year's budget process has evidenced more partisan \npolitics and political expediency than fiscal responsibility. As my \ncolleagues will recall, the original Senate budget resolution required \nus to enact legislation projected to actually balance the budget before \nwe could proceed to consideration of a tax cut.\n  When the resolution came back from the conference with the House, \nhowever, tax cuts had been added up front, and the deep spending \nreductions had been moved into the next century. The message that this \nbudget reconciliation bill sends by maintaining this approach is that \nwe should begin handing out new benefits today and count on future \nCongresses and future Presidents to make the most difficult choices to \nactually reach a balanced budget. It only increases the likelihood that \nthe budget will become even more unbalanced, hardly a legacy we want to \nleave to our children and our grandchildren. That will not do anything \nto reassure the international financial markets, much less address the \nincreasing cynicism our citizens feel toward our Government and its \nelected officials.\n\n  In order to pay for a huge tax break, half of which would go to those \nmaking $100,000 a year, programs affecting health care for the elderly, \nthe disabled and the poor, programs affecting the environment and \neducation, programs affecting some of our most vulnerable citizens who \nwill be cut more drastically than would otherwise be necessary is not \nfair.\n  My message to my colleagues and the President today is that there is \na better way to balance the budget, a way which I believe can be \nsupported by Members on both sides of the aisle, as well as the \nPresident and the American people. That way is to postpone a large tax \ncut until we achieve balance and spread the burden of deficit reduction \nmore fairly and evenly across the Federal budget. Only if we \ndemonstrate to the American people that a plan is fair and equitable \nwill we be able to maintain the road to balance.\n  As the Virginia voters showed just 10 days ago, those who toil at the \nideological extremes proceed at their own peril. It is true that the \nvast majority of the American people want to balance the Federal \nbudget, as I do. But the events of the last few months reflect the fact \nthat they want to do it in a way that reflects a broad consensus. Mr. \nPresident, I stand ready to work with both Republicans and Democrats to \nfind that consensus.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. I yield 4 minutes to the Senator from Oklahoma.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma is recognized for 4 \nminutes.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I thank the Senator for yielding.\n  I probably will not take that much time. But, Mr. President, I have \nbeen sitting here and listening and watching. And it has been really \nenlightening to me to see what is going on and how the debate has been \ngoing.\n  When I go back to Oklahoma and we have townhall meetings and I talk \nto people back there, the ones I have been chastised about for \nreferring to as the ``real people of America,'' they ask the question \nover and over again, ``Senator, why don't you just do it? All this talk \nabout balancing the budget. Why don't you just do it? We have to do it. \nWe have to live with a balanced budget. Why not do it?'' Because every \nbig spender around, every liberal in Congress says he or she wants to \nbalance the budget, and yet when it comes down to getting the \nopportunity to actually do it, we do not do it.\n  I hope those people who ask that question at the townhall meetings \nare watching carefully tonight, because now you know why it is so \ndifficult to do something that seems so easy back home.\n  The second thing is listening to some of these speeches--I do not \nmean this in a demeaning way or insulting way to anyone, but I really \nfeel that so many people right now are trying to hold onto the past \nwith white knuckles. Those individuals who rejoiced back in the 1960's \nwhen Government took greater control of our lives cannot believe that \ntimes are changing and that the people are no longer going to tolerate \nthat.\n  If you stop and analyze the elections of 1994, it is an overwhelming \nrevolution at the polls.\n  And who was defeated? All you have to do is get the ratings. You \nknow, people know who the big spenders are and who they are not. The \nNational Taxpayers Union, many others, have ratings. Those individuals \nwho lost at the polls in 1994 were the ones who were the big spenders.\n  This revolution started, really, back in 1980 with the election of \nRonald Reagan. Of course, he did not have the support of Congress, so \nhe could not get the things done he wanted to. I will always remember \nlooking at television on the Wednesday morning after the election, that \nlandslide election when Ronald Reagan won in 1980, and it was the \ndefeated person who had run against him. He was on the ``Today Show,'' \nand he made a statement I will always remember. He said, this is a \nquote, ``I cannot believe the people of America have so overwhelmingly \nrepudiated classic liberalism.''\n  And that is exactly what happened. But the problem is we never were \nable to carry out those programs, because we had a hostile and a \nliberal Congress.\n  That is changed now. That is all changed. For all those of you are \nwho sitting around here wringing your hands saying all these bad things \nare going to happen, all these people are going to be cut when, in \nfact, they are not going to be cut, all these horrible things we have \nbeen listening to tonight, just stop and think of it in this context:\n  In 1993, we passed--at that time, President Clinton had control of \nboth the House and the Senate--and we passed the largest single tax \nincrease in the history of public finance in America or anyplace in the \nworld. Those are not the words of conservative Republican Jim Inhofe; \nthose are the words of the Democrat leader of the Senate Finance \nCommittee, the chairman at that time.\n  So I suggest that if anyone was opposed to that great tax increase \nthat \n\n[[Page S 17292]]\neven now President Bill Clinton says was too great of a tax increase, \nif you are opposed to it, then you should be for these tax reductions \nnow. For all practical purposes, all we are doing is repealing part of \nthe damage we did to the American people in 1993.\n  So I wind up--my colleague, who I respect so much, from Minnesota, \nSenator Grams, made a talk and he ended up quoting Winston Churchill, \nand I think I will do the same. I can tell you folks on the other side \nof the aisle that the people of America know better. They do not want \nthe patterns of the past. They realize we have to do something. Winston \nChurchill said: ``Truth is incontrovertible, panic may resent it, \nignorance may deride it, malice may destroy it, but there it is.'' And \nthat is what we are going to learn tonight. I yield the floor.\n\n\n                    the need for privacy protection\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. In the few hours I have had to review the Republicans' \nconference report on budget reconciliation, I have come upon another \nmajor change in law that is being enacted without study, review or open \ndebate that can adversely affect the health care privacy of all of us.\n  For the past several years I have been working on legislation to \nimprove piracy protection for health care information. This session \nSenator Bennett and I have joined with a number of our colleagues from \nboth sides of the aisle to sponsor the Medical Record Confidentiality \nAct, S. 1360. Just this week Senator Kassebaum chaired a hearing on the \nbill before the Labor and Human Resources Committee. That hearing \nbrought home the fears that many have of the computerization of our \nmedical files. That development is already underway and is part of our \nmotivation for seeking to enact strong and effective privacy \nprotection.\n  Upon seeing the conference report, I find that the Republican-\ndominated conference has added to the bill provisions that require the \nSecretary of Health and Human Services to adopt standards and data \nelements to make information related to health care ``available to be \nexchanged electronically.'' This new section requiring the development \nand use of data networks is buried in section 8001 of title VIII of the \nbudget reconciliation bill and proposes a new section 1858 to the \nSocial Security Act.\n  I object to the inclusion of these provisions at this time in this \nmanner in this bill on which debate is so drastically restricted and to \nwhich amendments are not in order. I do so because the provisions fail \nto provide strong and effective privacy protections.\n  Our colleagues from Missouri and Connecticut have introduced the \nHealth Information Modernization and Security Act, S. 897, that seeks \nto legislate in this area of standardization of electronic data \nelements. When Senator Lieberman introduced that bill he acknowledge \nthe need to establish standards not just for accomplishing electronic \ntransactions, but also for the security and privacy of the medical \ninformation. Similarly Senator Bond, the other original sponsor, noted \nin his introductory remarks that ``most importantly, legislation is \nneeded to protect the privacy and confidentiality of patient data.'' \nTheir pending Senate bill references the need for privacy standards for \nhealth information to be established by regulation, and lists four \nprinciples to govern such standards.\n  The conference report includes no privacy protection. Privacy is \nnever mentioned in the entire new proposed section. Business interests \nare protected. Trade secrets are expressly protected. The security, \nintegrity, and confidentiality of the data is protected. But personal \nprivacy is not. Indeed, although the section contains a definition for \npurposes of the section of ``individually identifiable MedicarePlus and \nmedicare enrollment information,'' it is never employed in the section.\n  What is needed before we proceed to computerize personal health care \ninformation is the enactment of strong and effective privacy \nprotections. That is what the Medical Records Confidentiality Act, S. \n1360, is intended to provide--strong and effective protections with \nstrong criminal, civil, and administrative sanctions against those who \nviolate our medical privacy.\n  The privacy interests of the American people are being disserved. \nThose participating in Medicare are entitled to have their privacy \nprotected, as are we all. I urge my colleagues from both parties and \nboth Houses to join with me and reject this effort to proceed without \nthe necessary protections for individual privacy. This is the wrong way \nto proceed.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I rise in support of the Balanced Budget \nAct of 1995. Just as many thought they would never see the Berlin Wall \nfall, this is a day that I never thought I would see--the U.S. Congress \npassing a balanced budget that uses realistic economic assumptions, not \nrosy scenarios.\n  Over a year ago, Republicans campaigned to balance the budget and cut \ntaxes. The American people have become justifiably cynical about \npoliticians making promises to get elected. Well, this budget can be \nsummed up in one phrase: promise made, promise kept.\n  The Balanced Budget Act keeps our commitment to the American people; \nwe do balance the budget. And only after the nonpartisan Congressional \nBudget Office certified that the Republican plan achieves a balanced \nbudget did we turn to providing working families tax relief.\n  And let's be clear, in 1996, 88 percent of the tax cuts will go to \nfamilies earning under $100,000, 72 percent to families earning under \n$75,000.\n  These tax cuts are targeted to help families with a $500 per child \ntax credit, a tax credit to help families meet the costs of adoption \nand relief from the marriage penalty.\n  These tax cuts will also help family farms and small businesses by \nreducing the estate tax and lowering capital gains.\n  Republicans promised tax relief for working families and we have \ndelivered.\n  Mr. President, while Republicans have kept their promises to the \nvoters, President Clinton seems to want to forget the promises he made. \nHis alternative is to ``just say no.'' He stated that he would balance \nthe budget in 5 years, then he said 7 years, then 10 years. He has done \nmore flips and flops than a flapjack.\n  Now President Clinton is going to veto the continuing resolution that \nsimply states that the Congress and the President should agree to reach \na balanced budget in 7 years based on realistic economic assumptions. \nIt doesn't say how that should be reached, just that a balanced budget \nshould be the goal.\n  I should note that several Democrats in both the House and the Senate \nvoted for this commonsense continuing resolution calling for a balanced \nbudget in 7 years. They are sincere in wanting a balanced budget. My \nhope is that more conscientious Democrats will join this bipartisan \neffort for a balanced budget.\n  However, my concern is that still too many of my colleagues are like \nthe old man who says: ``How do I know what I think, until I've heard \nwhat I've said.'' Likewise, many in Congress don't know how to vote \nuntil they hear from the White House. I encourage my colleagues to \nput the people of this country first, before the shortsighted partisan \npolitics practiced by the White House.\n\n  Mr. President, the American people are beginning to realize the White \nHouse is engaging in gamesmanship instead of statesmanship. The great \nRepublican President, Abraham Lincoln was certainly right, ``You can't \nfool all the people all the time.'' This administration is going to \nlearn this lesson the hard way.\n  My mail is now running four-to-one in favor of Republicans standing \nfirm to their commitments for a balanced budget and tax relief for \nworking families. The phone calls are overwhelmingly in favor of the \nRepublicans effort to preserve Medicare and reform the current \ndisastrous Great Society Welfare programs--both part of this Balanced \nBudget Act of 1995.\n  In talking to my colleagues they are finding the same reaction. The \nAmerican people are listening and considering what is being done here \nin Washington. And they are supporting Republican efforts to keep the \npromises made to the voters last fall.\n  And why is public opinion shifting? The sad truth is becoming clear \nto Americans--President Clinton has no interest in balancing the \nbudget. President Clinton's top interest is appeasing the special \ninterests that still control the Democratic Party.\n  And what do these special interests want? They want to spend more, \nmore, \n\n[[Page S 17293]]\nand more of the taxpayers' money. The special interests don't want a \nbalanced budget and tax cuts for working families, that would mean less \nmoney for them to spend.\n  It seems the White House is completely captive to the special \ninterests. They still believe that big government should dictate how to \nspend the taxpayers' money instead of families making the decisions. I \nthought President Clinton said he got the message from the November \nelections. Unfortunately, it appears he was listening to the special \ninterests instead of the public interest.\n  Mr. President, this is a momentous vote. This is a vote for a real \nfuture for our children and grandchildren. For a stronger more \nproductive economy. It is a vote to preserve Medicare and reform \nwelfare.\n  I urge all my colleagues to stop listening to pollsters and the \nspecial interests who are running the White House and instead of \nlistening to the American people who want us to keep our promises, to \nnot break faith, and to pass the Balanced Budget Act of 1995.\n  Mr. President, I now want to briefly highlight a few specific \nprovisions that I am particularly pleased are incorporated in the 1995 \nBalanced Budget Act.\n  First, is the new student loan interest deduction. I have long fought \nfor the appropriate national investment in education. Once again the \nUnited States is investing in the minds of its people in addition to \nthe fixed assets of its businesses.\n  Mr. President, we also promised more choices in health care for \nMedicare beneficiaries. The Medicare reforms contained in this bill are \ngoing to make that possible. It is also going to be good for my State \nof Iowa.\n  Medicare is now going to reimburse for health care services much more \nfairly in Iowa than has been the case in the past. We have greatly \nincreased the Medicare per capita payments that will be made in Iowa in \nthe coming years.\n  This action is going to give our Medicare beneficiaries in Iowa more \nhealth care choices than is presently the case. We have also narrowed \nthe variation in Medicare's reimbursement from one area of the country \nto another, so that there will be greater equity in the use of our \nhard-earned tax and premium dollars.\n  I also want to point out that we have secured a number of very \nimportant health provisions which are going to help preserve the rural \nhealth infrastructure in Iowa:\n  The bill includes legislation I introduced earlier this year to \nrestart the Medicare Dependent Hospital Program. This is going to \nprovide greater financial support for at least 29 small rural hospitals \naround Iowa.\n  In addition, this bill includes my legislation to reform the Medicare \nreimbursement for physician assistants and nurse practitioners which \nwill also help improve access to primary care services in rural Iowa.\n  These are just a few examples of the many good provisions in the \nBalanced Budget Act of 1995, and underscore the importance of passing \nthis historic legislation.\n\n\n                     regarding environmental issues\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, the reconciliation bill now before us \ncontains a number of provisions that are poor policy, that are unfair \nto those least able to defend themselves and that consider only short-\nterm gain and not long-term loss. This is very clear from reading the \nEnergy and Natural Resources provisions. As a member of that committee \nI can tell you that this reconciliation bill contains many provisions \nthat are just plain poor energy policy, poor environmental policy, and \ncynical politicking.\n  Opening the Arctic Refuge to drillings is one such provision. The \nArctic Refuge is one of the last pristine wilderness areas left in \nAmerica. It contains the Nation's most significant polar bear denning \nhabitat on land, and supports 300,000 snow geese, migratory birds from \nsix continents--some of those birds even make it to my State of \nMinnesota--and a concentrated porcupine caribou calving ground.\n  Despite our uncertainty about the effects oil drilling would have on \nthe animals, there are those who continue to push for oil drilling \nwithout an updated environmental impact statement [EIS] as required by \ncurrent law. An EIS has not been done since 1987 and even that one was \nnot sufficient back then. We just don't know what drilling would to the \nArctic Refuge, and barreling ahead with drilling is just poor \nenvironmental policy.\n  Further, the Gwich'in people have relied on those porcupine caribou \nfor thousands of years to provide their food and meet their spiritual \nneeds. I have heard them speak very eloquently and directly about what \noil drilling in the Arctic Refuge would do to their way of life. People \nlike the Gwich'in want to save the environment. But they are not the \nbig oil companies. They do not have the money. They do not have the \nlobbyists, and they do not have the lawyers here every day. In today's \nWashington environment, that seems to mean that their concerns are less \nimportant than the concerns of big industry.\n  Even if whatever amount of revenue gained were somehow worth \ndestroying this unique land and the lives of the Gwich'in, there are a \nnumber of questions regarding whether the Arctic Refuge has oil, how \nmuch it has and what the cost would be to retrieve it. Estimates are \nbroad and disagreements are rampant. Even I, a nonscientist, know one \nthing for certain: there is no way to tell how much revenue can be \ngained from drilling in the Arctic Refuge. New information, however, \nsuggests previous figures overestimated possible revenue.\n  A second example of poor policy and a huge giveaway to oil and gas \ncompanies is the royalty holiday for oil and gas drilling in the Outer \nContinental Shelf. Oil and gas companies lease drilling rights in the \nGulf of Mexico from the Federal Government. Companies pay for the \nleases and must also pay royalties on their production because the oil \nand gas is a public resource. The reconciliation bill contains a \nprovision that would give companies a holiday from paying those \nroyalties. Because the leases will be considered more valuable by \ncompanies if they don't have to pay royalties on the production, the \nCBO says that the Government will be able to sell the leases at a \nhigher price and thus the royalty holiday will make money.\n\n  That is all smoke and mirrors. Friends of the oil and gas industry in \nCongress have taken advantage of the fact that the budget process looks \nonly at whether provisions make money in the first 7 years. The royalty \nholiday is expected to save the Federal Government $130 million in the \nfirst 7 years. This short-term savings allows us to say that we have \ntaken a step toward balancing the budget.\n  But when the short-term election year politicking ends, the other \nshoe will drop and it will drop hard. In the long-term, the \nCongressional Budget Office estimates that this royalty holiday will \ncost $550 million in lost receipts over 25 years. Thus, while the \nroyalty holiday means short-term gain, it also means long-term pain.\n  The royalty holiday is a clear example of corporate welfare at the \nexpense of the Federal budget. In these times of belt-tightening and \ndifficult choices about priorities, we can and must do better.\n  Some have said that the royalty holiday is needed to help persuade an \nailing industry to take part in a risky venture. However, an article in \nthe October 24, 1995, Wall Street Journal reports that oil companies, \n``* * * registered robust third-quarter earnings,'' and ``* * * \nreported a surprising gush of profits.'' Further, an October 30 \nBusiness Week article states that new technologies, ``* * * cut the \ncost of deep-sea production.''\n  I cannot stand by and watch the destruction of safety nets that \nprotect our elderly, our children, and our most needy while at the same \ntime providing a huge giveaway for an industry that just doesn't need \nit. The provisions I have mentioned are but two examples of the \nincredibly irresponsible environmental policy in this reconciliation \nbill.\n  Our natural resources are among the most important things we can \nleave to these future generations. Our children and our grandchildren \ndeserve more than what this bad energy policy, bad environmental \npolicy, and shortsighted politicking would leave them. I will continue \nto speak for all Minnesotans, for their sense of fairness and equity \nand for their love and concern for the environment. I urge my \ncolleagues to join me.\n\n[[Page S 17294]]\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I want to commend the hard work of all my \ncolleagues in producing this legislation. Although there are parts that \ndo concern me, in general I strongly support this bill and the goal of \nbalancing the budget in 7 years.\n  As one of the Senate Commerce Committee members who drafted title IV \nof the Senate bill and served as a conferee for this section of this \nlegislation, I want to clarify for the Record what I believe is \nintended by this bill regarding spectrum auctions.\n  Under the bill, the Federal Communications Commission [FCC] is \nmandated to identify and make available for public auction 100 Mhz of \nspectrum. I believe that auctioning this and other spectrum is the \nfairest, most equitable manner in which to allocate spectrum. I would \nhope that the Commission would understand this fact and become spectrum \nauction proponents. The auctioning of spectrum in an orderly manner--\ndone so that the public interest is served both by maximizing revenue \nto the Treasury and ensuring that services that use the spectrum \ncontinue in a manner that benefits the public--should be a goal of all \nFCC proceedings regarding the spectrum.\n  The bill before the Senate contains several criteria that the FCC \nshould use in selecting which blocks of spectrum to auction. I want to \nemphasize for the Record that the inclusion of any particular criteria \nfor the FCC to consider should not be viewed as limiting the \nCommission's authority to make a determination under its overall public \ninterest standard of what existing spectrum uses may need to be \ncontinued, or from considering in making its decision the impact on any \nexisting users of having to move to other frequencies or from \nrequiring, as a condition of any move, that the costs of relocation be \npaid by new users.\n  Most importantly, I urge the Commission to examine all the spectrum \nreferenced in this act and make determinations as to its allocation \nthat are fair, equitable, and that do not unduly hurt or burden any one \ngroup or industry.\n  Mr. President, I hope this clarification helps guide the FCC as it \nmoves toward auctions as mandated by this bill.\n\n\n              Tax Cuts in Reconciliation Conference Report\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I rise to express my opposition to the \nconference agreement on the reconciliation package, and to take \nparticular exception to the tax cuts in that package.\n  Mr. President, there is a great deal to dislike in the agreement, \nespecially with respect to Medicare and Medicaid.\n  The majority of the debate surrounding the reconciliation has \nconcerned these two programs, and the cuts to those programs certainly \nmerit the attention they have received.\n  Much has been said already about the Medicare and Medicaid cuts: cuts \nthat put the most vulnerable in our society at risk; cuts that are \nunnecessary to balance the Federal budget deficit.\n  But there is little doubt that these cuts were made as a direct \nresult of the need to fund the $245 billion tax cut.\n  Mr. President, the advocates of the reconciliation measure call the \ntax cut the crown jewel of the Contract With America.\n  Indeed, it is the $245 billion tax cut that drives the entire \nreconciliation package.\n  The assurances of health care coverage for the low-income, frail \nelderly, disabled, pregnant women, and children--both now and in the \nfuture--has been mortgaged to pay for tax cuts.\n  Mr. President, though I am persuaded that the nearly half a trillion \ndollars in cuts to Medicare and Medicaid have been made in order to \nfund the tax cut, some of our colleagues may take issue with that \ncharacterization.\n  They maintain that there are other reasons to take nearly half a \ntrillion dollars out of our health care system.\n  And, some who make that argument may even believe it.\n  But, Mr. President, for those who do believe that argument, there is \nstill no defense for the fiscally irresponsible tax cuts that are \nincluded in the reconciliation agreement.\n  Indeed, if one believes that these massive cuts are necessary in \norder to achieve a balanced budget, then there is no justification for \nsupporting the $245 billion tax cut that risks achieving that balance.\n  Mr. President, I have argued on a number of occasions that the budget \nplan outlined in the reconciliation measure is unsustainable.\n  In part, this comes from the refusal to deal honestly with the \nAmerican people, arguing, for example, that the $270 billion in cuts to \nMedicare are necessary to keep the Medicare trust fund solvent.\n  Of course, that is nonsense.\n  But the architects of this tax cut felt it necessary to spin this \nstory in order to produce the cuts needed to fund the tax cut.\n  Regrettably, the failure to be straight with the American people does \nmore than undercut this extreme proposal.\n  This deception will make it much more difficult for those of us who \nare willing to support some reasonable reforms to make our case to the \nNation that we need to make changes to Medicare not only to keep the \nprogram solvent, but also as a matter of deficit reduction.\n  Mr. President, beyond the issue of deceiving the public, this budget \nplan is also unsustainable because its priorities are unbalanced.\n  A budget plan that increases Defense spending, allows special \ninterest loopholes to continue to grow unchecked, cuts taxes by $245 \nbillion, and does all of that while gutting our health care protections \nis a budget plan that does not reflect anything close to the mainstream \nview of the Nation.\n  The priorities reflected in this budget are extremist, and the Nation \nsimply will not support their ongoing implementation over the next \nseveral years.\n  This plan will not survive its full 7-year lifetime.\n  And I suspect, Mr. President, that it is not intended to survive \nthose 7 years.\n  The biggest cuts come in the latter years, sufficiently far off to \nallow panicked State governments to lobby for the overturn of the \nbrutal cuts that are scheduled to descend in 2002--25 percent of the \ntotal cuts in the Senate passed bill occur in that year alone, 46 \npercent in the last 2 years.\n  Mr. President, some who support this measure may believe in the brave \nnew world it conceives.\n  But there are others who support this measure who do not hold that \nview.\n  They understand that this budget is unsustainable over the full 7 \nyears.\n  They may even hope that someone or something will rescue us from that \nlast years of this budget.\n  But if their goal is not the dawning of a new order, what is their \npurpose in supporting this measure?\n  Mr. President, their goal is not a balanced budget.\n  Their goal is a fiscally irresponsible tax cut.\n  How else can this bill be explained?\n  How else can one explain a $245 billion tax cut in a bill that \nprovides for annual deficits that add $700 billion to our Federal debt?\n  If balancing the budget were their highest priority, there would not \nbe a $245 billion tax cut in the reconciliation package.\n  Mr. President, supporters of the reconciliation measure had the \nopportunity to demonstrate that balancing the Federal books was a \nhigher priority than providing a $245 billion tax cut.\n  The senior Senator from West Virginia [Mr. Byrd] and I offered an \namendment to the reconciliation bill during our limited debate that did \nnothing but strike the tax cut, lowering the bill's cumulative deficits \nby $245 billion.\n  Mr. President, the change to the bill by that amendment alone would \nhave balanced the Federal books in 2001, a year before the underlying \nmeasure.\n  Only two of the Members who supported the reconciliation package also \nsupported that amendment.\n  Balanced budget, Mr. President?\n  If supporters of the reconciliation measure really wanted to balance \nthe budget, they would have supported that amendment.\n  Their failure to do so is clear evidence that the $245 billion tax \ncut, not a balanced budget, is their highest priority.\n  If the $245 billion tax cut were not the priority of the \nreconciliation bill, we would not see the $450 billion cuts to Medicare \nand Medicaid.\n  If the $245 billion tax cut were not the priority of the \nreconciliation bill, we would not have seen the tortured, \n\n[[Page S 17295]]\nand even dangerous precedents set on this floor during the \nreconciliation debate through rulings from the Chair on what can only \nbe called highly questionable parliamentary interpretations of budget \npoints of order with respect to Social Security.\n  Senate rules prevent a fuller discussion of those events.\n  It is enough to say that the question need never have come up.\n  We need never have risked damage to the integrity of our rules had \nthere been a willingness to pare back this unjustifiable tax cut to 95 \npercent of its proposed level.\n  The $12 billion raid on the Social Security trust fund, and the \ncarefully scripted parliamentary exchange used to subvert our budget \nrules, was made necessary because of an unwillingness to lower the tax \ncut by so little as 5 percent.\n  Mr. President, I understand that the conference committee found a \ndifferent source of funding, making the raid on the Social Security \nTrust Fund unnecessary.\n  But the damage is done.\n  In an effort to protect the tax cut at all costs, a critical budget \nrule has been weakened.\n  Though the $12 billion may have been restored to the trust fund, the \nintegrity of the Senate's budget rules has been compromised.\n  This is not the first assault on our budget rules in the name of \ncutting taxes.\n  I am reminded in particular of the so-called dynamic scoring debate, \na backdoor attempt to circumvent our budget procedures--again, done in \nthe name of cutting taxes.\n  Mr. President, in the name of cutting taxes, the extremists will \ndeceive the public, compromise our budget rules, slash health care \nprotections for the most vulnerable in society, and forsake efforts to \nbalance the Federal budget.\n  Mr. President, this budget is extreme.\n  And the driving force behind its excess is the $245 billion tax cut--\na tax cut that apparently is timed to be mailed out only days before \nthe 1996 elections.\n  Those who want to understand this reconciliation package need look no \nfurther than the tax cuts.\n  All other provisions flow from the assumed tax cuts.\n  All the actions surrounding the measure flow from the assumed tax \ncuts.\n  As I have noted, some who support this budget may actually endorse \nthe measure's extremism.\n  Others support it in spite of its extremism.\n  But make no mistake.\n  Those who endorse the extreme provisions in reconciliation and those \nwho back the measure in spite of them, support the bill primarily as a \nvehicle to cut $245 billion in taxes.\n  The fiscally irresponsible tax cut is the essence of this measure and \nit infects the entire package.\n  I urge the President to veto this measure, so we can begin putting \ntogether a budget plan that will balance our Federal books by 2002 or \nsooner.\n  A budget plan that will have enough public support to ensure that it \nwill be sustained for the full duration.\n  A budget plan that includes cuts to Medicare and Medicaid, but a plan \nthat cuts smart, not one that cuts mean.\n  A budget plan that distributes the burden of reducing the deficit \nfairly.\n  One that includes the defense budget as well as our health care \nbudget.\n  One that includes one of the most rapidly growing areas of our \nFederal budget--tax expenditures.\n  A budget plan that does not include the fiscally reckless $245 \nbillion tax cut that jeopardizes our most important economic goal, a \nbalanced Federal budget.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n\n                chapter 4--federal oil and gas royalties\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, the Federal oil and gas royalty chapter \nin the Balanced Budget Act is the only legislative initiative taken in \nthe last 13 years to cost-effectively increase the Nation's third \nlargest source of revenue--mineral royalties from Federal lands, more \nspecifically, oil and gas royalties. This legislation would establish a \ncomprehensive statutory plan to increase the collection of royalty \nreceipts due the United States. These mineral receipts will help reduce \nour budget deficit. Without this legislation, an ineffective and costly \nroyalty collection system will continue, perpetuating long delays and \nuncollected royalties.\n  Let me make absolutely clear, Mr. President, that this legislation \ndoes not apply to Indian lands. It applies only to royalties from oil \nand gas production on Federal lands.\n  This is historic legislation, Mr. President, in that it would empower \nStates to perform oil and gas royalty management functions, such as \nauditing and collecting, that are essential to bringing additional \nreceipts to the Treasury and the States within a 6-year limitation \nperiod established by this legislation. By expanding the States' role \nin performing Federal oil and gas royalty management functions \nconsistent with Federal law and regulation, States are provided a great \neconomic incentive that also benefits the Federal Treasury. The more \naggressive States are in performing delegated functions, the greater \ntheir share of net receipts under the Mineral Leasing Act. That act \nrequires 50 percent of all royalties from Federal onshore oil and gas \nproduction to be shared with producing States.\n  Chapter 4 establishes a framework for the Federal oil and gas royalty \ncollection program that will bring in an additional $51 million in \nrevenues to the U.S. Treasury and provide an additional $33 million to \nthe States over 7 years. These additional receipts result primarily \nfrom: First, Requiring the Secretary of the Interior and delegated \nStates to timely collect all claims within 6 years rather than allow \nthe claims to become stale and uncollectible; second, requiring early \nresolution and collection of disputed claims before their value \ndiminishes; third, requiring Federal and State resources to be used in \na manner that maximizes receipts through more aggressive collection \nactivities; and fourth, increasing production on Federal lands by \ncreating economic and regulatory incentives. Without the statutory \nframework of this legislation, the Nation's third largest revenue \nsource--the Interior Department's Minerals Management Service is the \nthird largest source of revenue behind the IRS and Customs Service--\nwill continue to be subject to greatly delayed collections and the risk \nof reduced receipts due to noncollection over time.\n  To achieve the goal of maximizing collections through more timely and \naggressive collection efforts, this legislation would do the following \nspecific things. It would require the Secretary, delegated States, and \nlessees to take action respecting an obligation within 6 years from the \ndate that obligation became due. The provisions require that judicial \nproceedings or demands--for example, orders to pay--be commenced or \nissued within 6 years of the date when the obligation became due or be \nbarred. Use of legal authority other than that provided in this \nsection--for example, the Debt Collection Act--is not precluded so long \nas judicial proceedings or demands are commenced or issued within the \n6-year period. It is not intended that such other legal authority be \nused as a substitute for, or to circumvent, emasculate or otherwise \nfrustrate, the 6-year limitation period. Lessees would be required to \nmaintain their records during the 6-year period in order to verify \nproduction volumes.\n  The legislation would expedite the administrative appeals process at \nthe Interior Department by establishing a 30-month limitation on \nappeals. Presently, over $450 million in disputed claims languish in a \nbureaucratic appeals process and continue to lose value. By speeding up \nthe appeals process, the Secretary would increase the value of these \nobligations and collections to the Treasury.\n  The legislation also would level the playing field for royalty payors \nby authorizing the payment of interest on overpayments. Present law \nrequires lessees to pay interest on late payments and underpayments as \na disincentive for being tardy or underpaying royalties, but does not \ncompensate lessees who overpay royalties and who lose the time value of \nthat money through some legitimate error. This legislation would \nprovide for payment of interest on overpayments without regard to the \namount of the overpayment.\n  And finally, Mr. President, the legislation would authorize the \nSecretary to allow prepayment of royalties and \n\n[[Page S 17296]]\nto provide other regulatory relief for marginal properties, and require \nthat adjustments or requests for refunds for underpayments or \noverpayments be pursued within a 5-year window coinciding with the 6-\nyear limitation period.\n  Mr. President, CBO estimates that chapter 4 provisions will procure \nsavings of $6 million in fiscal year 1996, $40 million in 5 years, $51 \nmillion in 7 years, and $66 million in 10 years. We believe this \nlegislation will do more than simply bring receipts to the Government \nearlier than they would arrive under the present system, Mr. President. \nWe believe a more efficient, effective, and aggressive program, \ncombined with some of the economic incentives and regulatory relief, \nwill bring new savings to the Treasury and the States. Because of these \nsavings, the provisions in chapter 4 are an important part of the \nBalanced Budget Act of 1995.\n\n\n                              Section 1107\n\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I rise to engage in a colloquy with Senator \nLugar, the distinguished chairman of the Committee on Agriculture, \nNutrition and Forestry, regarding section 1107 of the bill.\n  Mr. LUGAR. I would be pleased to engage the Senator from Idaho in a \ncolloquy.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Is it your understanding that section 1107 of the bill \nreforms the Federal Sugar Program by imposing a forfeiture penalty \nwhich effectively reduces the loan level for sugar by 1 cent per pound, \neliminating domestic sugar allotments that control supply, \nconditionally authorizing the use of recourse sugar program loans, and \nincreasing the contributions of sugar producers toward deficit \nreduction by increasing the assessments on sugar marketings by 25 \npercent?\n  Mr. LUGAR. The gentleman is correct, the reforms in section 1107 will \nresult in more competitive sugar prices, enhanced Government revenues, \nand the potential for increased sugar imports.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. Chairman, as a conferee for the Senate on section 1107 \nof the bill, it is my understanding that the conferees have agreed to \ninclude language in subsection (d) of section 1107 that will reform the \nSugar Program by authorizing, for the first time, the Secretary of \nAgriculture to administer the program through the use of recourse \nloans, subject to specific conditions. If implemented, the use of \nrecourse loans is a major reform from the nonrecourse loans that have \nbeen used to support the prices of all basic farm program commodities \nin this century. The conferees authorized the use of recourse loans for \nthe Sugar Program only subject to specific conditions outlined in \nsection 1107(d) of the bill. Is this your understanding as well?\n  Mr. LUGAR. The gentleman is correct. Section 1107 conditionally \nauthorizes the Secretary to depart from current practice and use \nrecourse loans to administer the Sugar Program. Section 1107(d)(2) \nconditions the use of recourse loans on the requirement that the \nSecretary provide nonrecourse loans in the event that the tariff rate \nquota for imports of sugar into the United States is established at, or \nincreased to, a level in excess of 1.5 million short tons of sugar in \nany year. It is the clear intent of the conferees that if the \nsubsection (d) conditional authorization for the use of recourse loans \nto administer the Sugar Program, or the restrictive conditions on the \nuse of such authority in paragraphs (2) and (3) of subsection (d), is \nremoved from the bill, the Secretary of Agriculture shall continue to \nadminister the Sugar Program through the use of nonrecourse loans \nauthorized under subsections (a) and (b).\n\n\n         medicaid payments to indian health service facilities\n\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Mr. President, I would like to discuss several \nimportant Medicaid provisions in the Balanced Budget Act that will have \nan impact on my home State of South Dakota.\n  The Medicaid reform proposal, as contained within the Balanced Budget \nReconciliation Act, would maintain current law that requires the States \nto pass through to Indian Health Service facilities funding from the \nState's federal Migrant allotment. For a State such as South Dakota--\nwith 37 percent of its Medicaid beneficiaries being Native Americans--\nthis creates a highly problematic situation. Let me explain. Presently, \nthe IHS budget is funded at an amount less than actual need. To deal \nwith this shortfall, Federal funds have been made available through \nState Medicaid programs. As my colleagues know, the proposed Medicaid \nreform provisions would cap Federal Medicaid funds to the States. As a \nresult, States with IHS and significant Native American populations \nfacilities would be forced to use limited Federal funds to supplement \nthe intentional shortfalls in the IHS budget, which could limit \nMedicaid service availability to Medicaid eligible Native and non-\nNative Americans. To compensate, States may need to limit payments to \nIHS facilities to conserve Federal dollars, or utilize limited State \nresources to make up shortfalls for non-Indian people. In short, the \nMedicaid reform proposal would unfairly single out those States--37 in \nall--with a significant Indian population.\n  The majority leader has requested from me and the Governor of my \nState suggestions as to how we may rectify this situation. I believe \nthree possible solutions exist: First, the creation of a separate \ntribal allocation equal to \\1/2\\ of 1 percent of the budget for the new \nMedicaid Program that would assure reimbursement for services to Native \nAmericans through their Indian health programs. This allocation could \nbe provided either through a direct billing mechanism between the \ntribes and the Federal Government, or through the current pass-through \nstructure. Second, a repeal of the current Federal statute that \nrequires States to serve as a pass through for IHS Medicaid funds. This \nwould release States of what I believe to be an improper involvement in \nthe special relationship that exists between the Federal Government, \nthe Indian Health Service and Native American citizens. This repeal \nwould require the establishment of a direct billing mechanism to \nsatisfy existing requirements of 100 percent Federal reimbursement; or \nthird, to satisfy those States desirous of maintaining current law, a \nstructure that would allow States the option to either continue serving \nas a pass through, or to insist on a direct Federal-tribal \nrelationship.\n  Mr. President, at issue is the increased flexibility we promised our \nNation's Governors in return for their acceptance of a revised Medicaid \nfunding formula. Obviously, maintenance of the current system would \nseverely hamper the flexibility of States with significant Native \nAmerican populations. Two factors are involved: A capped Medicaid \ngrant, and a 100-percent Federal reimbursement requirement for Medicaid \neligible Native Americans. Without additional Federal funds under the \ncurrent system, or a direct Federal-tribal billing system, the result \nwill be added pressure on States to use its own funds to maintain \nservices for Medicaid eligible non-Indians. The majority leader has \nindicated his interest and support for finding an appropriate solution. \nUnfortunately, this issue was left unresolved prior to the completion \nof conference. On behalf of the numerous Senators and Governors who \nhave contacted the majority leader on this issue, it is my hope we will \nfind a fair solution once the President vetoes this legislation.\n\n  Mr. President, I see the senior Senator from Alaska on the floor. I \nknow my colleague shares my concerns regarding the current Medicaid \nreform proposals and would yield to him to make any comments on this \nsubject.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I thank my friend from South Dakota. Mr. President, I \nshare Senator Pressler's concerns regarding funding for Medicaid \nservices provided to Indians and to Native Alaskans. In Alaska, \napproximately 35 to 40 percent of Medicaid recipients are Native \nAlaskans.\n  In the past, the Federal Government has paid 100 percent of the costs \nof Medicaid services delivered to Alaska Natives in Indian Health \nService facilities. The State of Alaska acted only as a conduit for \nthese funds. I understand that the proposed MediGrant Program would \ncontinue to require that health services provided to eligible Alaska \nNatives in IHS facilities as well as tribally owned or operated \nfacilities be paid 100 percent by the Federal Government. In light of \nfunding shortfalls for the Indian Health Service, IHS facilities in \nAlaska depend on these third-party payments from the Medicaid Program \nto meet their expenses.\n  However, under a capped MediGrant Program, Alaska may be faced with a \n\n\n[[Page S 17297]]\nHobson's Choice of either cutting back on payments to Native facilities \nor being forced to cut back on payments for services to poor non-Native \nAlaskans. This could easily lead to racial tensions in Alaska which we \nall work very hard to avoid.\n  I would like to add my voice to that of my colleague from South \nDakota in urging your continued cooperation in finding an equitable \nsolution to this problem.\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Mr. President, I see the distinguished majority leader \non the floor and I would like to yield to him to make a brief statement \nregarding Medicaid payments made to Native American health programs \nserving Medicaid eligible native Americans.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I recognize the importance of this issue to \nSouth Dakota, Alaska, and other States with significant native American \npopulations. I have had a number of recent conversations with my \ncolleagues from South Dakota and Alaska. I also heard from the Governor \nof South Dakota. They have made me aware of the impact this issue may \nhave upon their States. The Senators from South Dakota and Alaska have \nmy assurance that I will continue working with them to find a solution \nto this complex issue.\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Mr. President, I thank the majority leader and my \nfriend from Alaska. I appreciate the majority leader's consideration of \nour request and look forward to working with him on this matter of \ngreat importance to South Dakota, Alaska, and all other States with \nsignificant native American populations.\n\n\n          Dairy Provisions in Reconciliation Reveal Hypocrisy\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, during this budget debate, it became \nquite clear that Republican's rhetoric about less Government, less \nregulation, less spending, and the end of business as usual, cannot \nstem their rush to pass this particular budget package, regardless of \nthe contents of the package. The hypocrisy of that rhetoric was \nrevealed during these debates, when Republicans began abandoning not \nonly their own rhetoric, but also members of their own party in an \neffort to pass a budget.\n  Mr. President, I am talking about the sequence of events that have \noccurred both in this Chamber and the House of Representatives on dairy \npolicy. Actions of the Republican leadership are more significant for \nwhat they didn't do than for what they did do on dairy policy. What \ndoes this budget reconciliation bill before us do on dairy policy? \nNothing, Mr. President, absolutely nothing. No savings, no reform, and \nclearly no courage to make the tough calls.\n  This is inexcusable during a year in which this budget bill \nrepresents the vehicle for major reform of all agricultural programs. \nDairy policy, and specifically, the Federal milk marketing order system \nis badly in need of reform. Federal milk marketing orders are an \nantiquated, overly regulatory system of setting milk prices throughout \nthe country and determining where, when, and how milk should be \nshipped. The system sets minimum milk prices artificially high in many \nparts of the country at a significant cost to both taxpayers and \nconsumers, and to the extreme disadvantage of dairy farmers in \nWisconsin and throughout the Upper Midwest, where fluid milk prices are \nthe lowest by law. The system has distorted the market resulting in \nperverse economic incentives for overproduction in a sector for which \nthe slightest oversupply can send farm-level prices plummeting.\n  This budget bill presented an ideal and unique opportunity to both \nreform Federal milk marketing orders, reduce regulation and save \nmillions in taxpayer dollars. Eliminating Federal orders while leaving \na basic support system in place would have saved $669 million over 5 \nyears, which is only about $100 million shy of the conference committee \ntarget for dairy. Instead of taking the route of terminating this \nsystem and letting the market work, the Republicans dropped the $800 \nmillion in savings the conference committee was to achieve from dairy.\n  But, Mr. President, nothing was done, no changes were made. We are \nleft with the status quo--the status quo that the leaders of the so-\ncalled revolution had made a commitment to end. ``We are going to end \nbusiness as usual''--that is what the Republicans told the American \npeople.\n  Well, it is business as usual, Mr. President.\n  That was pretty clear when the Senate took up dairy late last month. \nThe Senate version of reconciliation not only did nothing to eliminate \nthe inequities and regulatory burdens of Federal milk marketing orders, \nbut actually provided for more Government regulation, more market \ndistortion and more regional inequities. During floor action, Senators \napproved legislation imposing a hidden tax on dairy farmers throughout \nthe Nation for the benefit of a few west coast States--known as class \nIV pooling. The Senate also approved the northeast dairy compact which \nwas astonishing in this political climate. Some of the very Members of \nthis body who have been decrying the consumer costs and excessive \nGovernment intervention imposed by the sugar and peanut programs, not \nonly voted to impose a milk tax on New England consumers but also to \nallow six States to set minimum milk prices well above that allowed \nunder current law.\n  The House, after seeking some reform compromise on Federal orders, \nultimately voted to eliminate them. That was certainly the wiser of the \ntwo courses, and an approach, which I ultimately endorsed following the \nSenate's ill-conceived actions. The Upper Midwest is harmed so badly by \nFederal orders, that in the absence of reform, they prefer a completely \nunregulated market to an overregulated one.\n  Despite the efforts of those of us from the Upper Midwest to reform \nFederal orders and despite the months of effort by Congressman \nGunderson, a Republican and chairman of the House Subcommittee on Dairy \nPolicy, to terminate the program when reform efforts failed, the \nRepublican majority took a walk on dairy policy. Congressman Gunderson \nworked hard to set dairy policy right. Unfortunately, in the end when \nit counted, Speaker Gingrich decided that political expediency was more \nimportant than supporting his chairman's package. The Republicans have \nabrogated their responsibilities on a tough issue.\n  House Speaker Newt Gingrich indicated that reform of Federal Orders \nwould be high on the Republican agenda following Thanksgiving. However, \ngiven that Speaker Gingrich was willing to forgo $800 million in budget \nsavings in order to avoid a fight in his own party on dairy policy, I \nam highly skeptical that his commitment to reform is terribly strong.\n  Mr. President, I have always said there are three avenues to \nrestoring fairness to Wisconsin farmers: judicially--by bringing legal \nactions against the Department of Agriculture; legislatively--which now \nseems unrealistic; and administratively--through the Secretary of \nAgriculture's vast rulemaking authority.\n  Several months ago, Secretary of Agriculture Dan Glickman accepted my \ninvitation to participate in a barn meeting with dairy farmers in \nGreenleaf, WI. Having spent an hour and a half listening to dairy \nfarmers, Secretary Glickman conceded that indeed Federal orders \ndiscriminate against the Upper Midwest to the benefit of dairy farmers \nin other parts of the country and that fluid milk prices set too high \nin some regions encouraged overproduction.\n  While I have long been skeptical of the ability of the Department of \nAgriculture to do the right thing with respect to orders, I think the \ndairy farmers of Wisconsin have in Dan Glickman a Secretary who has at \nleast been willing to admit our farmers have been justified in their \ncries of ``foul.'' Previous Secretaries have failed in their duties in \nthat respect.\n  So, today I am calling on Dan Glickman to do what Congress apparently \ncannot--make the changes to this antiquated program that the farmers of \nWisconsin so deserve. I hope, and feel confident, that Dan Glickman has \nthe courage that the Republican leadership lacks on this matter.\n  I would put my colleagues on notice, however, that I am not willing \nto give up the fight in this Chamber. This battle for fairness is not \nover. And, Mr. President, if Members are not willing to compromise to \nachieve reform, I will seek the termination of Federal milk marketing \norders.\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, it is now or never time in the economic \nhistory \n\n[[Page S 17298]]\nof our country. At the end of this year, our national debt will exceed \n$5 trillion. We are adding to the debt at the astonishing rate of \n$9,600 per second. As I speak, every man, woman, and child in America \nis more than $18,000 in debt. There is little doubt that a crisis is at \nhand. The only question remaining is: Will the Congress and the \nPresident of the United States step up to the plate and solve the \nproblem?\n  The Balanced Budget Act of 1995 before the Senate today is the \ncongressional answer to our crushing debt problem. It may not be the \nfinal answer, it may not be the perfect answer, but it is the only \nanswer put forth thus far. President Clinton has never submitted a \nbalanced budget to Congress, and has made it clear that he never will. \nIn fact, as the ongoing Government shutdown shows, the President would \nrather close the Federal Government than agree to balance the budget. \nClearly, President Clinton does not have his priorities straight.\n  Over the past several weeks, we have heard vicious attacks on the \nbalanced budget bill that is before the Senate today. The Republican \nbalanced budget has been called ``immoral'' and ``irresponsible.'' The \nAmerican people have been warned of ``devastating'' cuts in spending. \nTo the casual observer, it might appear that the sky is about to fall. \nThe truth, however, is quite different. In fact, the budget before the \nSenate today is the only chance to save our country from an immoral, \nirresponsible, and devastating future.\n  Mr. President, if there was an easy solution to our fiscal problems, \nyou can rest assured that Congress would have found it long ago. I do \nnot agree with every provision in the bill before the Senate. If I \ncould pick and choose, there are many priorities that I would change. \nOn the balance, however, I think the product is a good one because it \ngets the job done. There are no smoke and mirrors, just a solid \nbalanced budget using solid economic assumptions. I would like to \ncommend Senator Domenici for his leadership and hard work on this bill.\n  The bill before the Senate will balance the Federal budget in 7 \nyears. That fact has been certified by the Congressional Budget Office. \nThe budget will save Medicare from bankruptcy, and strengthen and \nprotect the program for future generations. The legislation completely \noverhauls our broken welfare system. It transfers power away from \nWashington bureaucrats and returns it to State and local officials.\n  The benefits of a balanced budget far outweigh any temporary pain. \nThe Congressional Budget Office estimates that a balanced budget will \nresult in a reduction of long term interest rates of approximately 2 \npercent. On a typical student loan, that reduction would save American \nstudents $8,885. On a typical car loan, it would save the consumer \n$676. On a 30 year, $80,000 mortgage, lower interest rates would save \nthe homeowner $38,653 over the life of the mortgage.\n  Mr. President, the Senate bill also provides significant tax relief \nto American families. I know that many of my colleagues have expressed \ndisdain at the idea of cutting taxes. Apparently, they find it \noffensive to let American taxpayers keep more of their hard-earned \nmoney. I would ask, is it offensive to provide a $500 per child tax \ncredit? Is it offensive to create a tax credit for adoption expenses? \nIs it offensive to provide a tax credit for interest paid on a student \nloan?\n  I certainly do not think so?\n  The critics of tax cuts think Members of Congress can spend money \nbetter than a family of four in Berlin, NH, or Cleveland, OH, or \nAtlanta, GA. I would respectfully disagree. The only way to limit the \nsize and scope of the Federal Government is to limit its source of \nenergy. The Federal Government is fueled by taxes. Simply put, the more \nUncle Sam collects in taxes, the more Uncle Sam will spend. In 1993, \nPresident Clinton raised taxes on the American people by $250 billion. \nHe wanted to expand the Government. In 1995, the Republican Congress \nproposes to reduce taxes by $245 billion. We want to shrink the \nGovernment.\n  Mr. President, I have held a good many town meetings in New Hampshire \nto talk about the budget, taxes, welfare reform, and Medicare. Often, \nwhen I say that Congress intends to balance the budget in 7 years, my \nconstituents ask why we are waiting that long! It is a difficult \nquestion to answer. There is no danger in going too far, too fast, as \nmany would have us believe. The real risk to all Americans is the risk \nthat we will not get the job done.\n  I have waited 10 years for the opportunity to vote for a balanced \nbudget. The time for waiting is over and the time for acting is now. \nThis budget is bold; it is real, and it stands alone as the only \nsolution to our Nation's fiscal problems. I urge my colleagues to \nsupport the Balanced Budget Act of 1995, and I urge the President to \nsign the bill into law.\n\n\n             ``midnight in america'' and budget priorities\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I rise today to call the attention of my \ncolleagues to an excellent recent opinion column by Jamie Stiehm \ndistributed by New America News Service/New York Times Special \nFeatures. The column, entitled ``Midnight in America,'' describes the \nSenate passage of the Budget Reconciliation bill last month, and is \nespecially timely now as the Senate continues to debate the Republican \nbudget plan. As the column makes clear, the true debate is about \nfundamental American priorities and the kind of country America will be \nin the years ahead. I believe Ms. Stiehm's column will be of interest \nto all of us in Congress, and I ask unanimous consent that it may be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the column was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                        ``Midnight in America''\n\n                           (By Jamie Stiehm)\n\n  [From the New America News Service/New York Times Special Features]\n\n       Now that the O.J. Simpson trial and the World Series are \n     over, maybe America can pay attention to another show--and \n     what a show it is on the floors of the House and the Senate.\n       Not all revolutions have to happen in the streets. Nor do \n     all revolutionaries look like Lenin. The one we're having \n     right now is something we can see on C-SPAN and arose largely \n     as a result of apathy, not action, on the part of the \n     American electorate, most of whom forgot to vote last fall.\n       So what we have here is a character named Newt changing the \n     course of a perfectly nice country, while most of its \n     citizens weren't even watching.\n       Make no mistake, this is no budget business as usual. The \n     manner, means and contents of the enormous budget bill passed \n     by Congress--just as the clock struck midnight on the Senate \n     side--are like nothing its members have seen, done or dreamt \n     before.\n       First, the idea of allowing 30 seconds of debate on both \n     sides of some amendments might seem strange in the greatest \n     deliberative body in the world. But the Senate needed no more \n     time than that to pass amendments like the one allowing 19 \n     million acres of Alaskan wilderness to be opened to oil \n     drilling. Don't ask what that has to do with a balanced \n     budget, because I don't know. What I do know is that the \n     Senate rejected the same idea of drilling in the Arctic \n     preserve after a long floor fight a few years ago--just one \n     way the times have changed.\n       Another is the sheer refusal to deal across the aisle. \n     Traditionally, politics is about the art of the possible, the \n     search for a compromise that makes the greatest number of \n     people happy. But not this time. The only bargaining and \n     concessions made were between Republicans themselves, with \n     moderate Republicans able to make a small difference to the \n     final outcome. For example, they persuaded Majority Leader \n     Bob Dole (R-Kan.) not to knock out all federal nursing home \n     standards. Again, don't ask me what that particular issue has \n     to do with a balanced budget.\n       As far as Republicans were concerned, though, Democrats \n     were just making so much noise about tax cuts and Medicare \n     cuts. The two figures are suspiciously similar, with \n     Republicans proposing to cut taxes by $245 billion and \n     Medicare by $270 billion over the next seven years. That's \n     what Democratic senators such as Edward Kennedy (D-Mass.) \n     were roaring about all week, the unseemliness of changing the \n     tax code at the expense of health care for senior citizens. \n     Not to mention the fact tax cut helps the rich and hurts the \n     poor. Those earning under $30,000 will actually pay higher \n     taxes under the new budget plan brought to us.\n       Makes a whole heap of sense, doesn't it? Especially when \n     the latest poll reveals that most voters, including \n     registered Republicans, don't even want that tax cut.\n       Finally, please don't ask me why the Pentagon didn't lose a \n     penny under this budget--in fact, it got a few billion \n     dollars more than it asked for, though there are no wars, \n     cold or hot, in sight.\n       Yet plainly embedded between the lines and numbers of this \n     latest Capitol Hill budget are values that go \n     counterclockwise to American history. Throughout most of this \n     century, since the Progressive Era and the New Deal, the \n     direction of social legislation \n\n[[Page S 17299]]\n     has been to make the federal government a friend, not an enemy, for \n     most American citizens and families. Social Security and the \n     G.I. bill are the classic examples of this trend, of course, \n     but there are countless others, such as the 1964 Civil Rights \n     Act.\n       But now the new thing is ``devolution,'' a word heard \n     almost every day on the Hill. That translates to sending \n     money, power and responsibility from the federal government \n     to the states to take care of public assistance for the aged, \n     sick and poor. The ways and means to this end is through \n     another new buzz word, ``block grants.''\n       Since when have states suddenly become beacons of wisdom \n     and enlightenment in political dialogue? The last time states \n     were regarded with such reverence by politicians in Congress \n     was right before the Civil War. But believe me, I'd rather \n     have the federal government watching over social welfare and \n     equal justice than any one of the 50 states. That, if nothing \n     else, is a painful lesson from our history.\n       There was a good reason why the Founding Fathers decided we \n     are the United States, not simply the States. America stands \n     for something more than the sum of its parts.\n       ``The people have bread, but they want circuses,'' said a \n     wise member of the Senate as he walked onto the floor to \n     vote.\n       Change channels, America. Watch Newt Gingrich try to lead \n     the latest American revolution--or should I say devolution--\n     and see if that's the country you want to wake up to the \n     morning after midnight.\n\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, there are a number of compelling economic \nreasons to support a balanced budget: Lower interest rates: Higher \neconomic growth. Others have drawn those implications in detail.\n  But these economic facts do not fully explain the urgency of this \nissue in the minds of many Americans. There is a moral aspect to this \ndebate, and a moral imperative we must understand. Many of us are \nconvinced that endless deficits are not only unwise, but unprincipled. \nThey are not just a drag on our economy, they are a burden on our \nnational conscience.\n  Thomas Jefferson defined this moral aspect, arguing that:\n\n       The question of whether one generation has the right to \n     bend another by the deficit it imposes is a question of such \n     consequence as to place it among the fundamental principles \n     of Government. We should consider ourselves unauthorized to \n     saddle posterity with our debts, and be morally bound to pay \n     them ourselves.\n\n  We are debating one of the fundamental principles of government, and \none of the basic moral commitments between generations. It has always \nbeen one of the highest moral traditions for parents to sacrifice for \nthe sake of their children. It is the depth of selfishness to call on \nchildren to sacrifice for the sake of their parents. Mr. President, if \nwe continue on the current path, we will violate this trust between \ngenerations, and earn the contempt of the future.\n  Every child born in America now inherits nearly $19,000 in public \ndebt. This is the destructive legacy of a Government without courage. \nWhile decades of deficit spending has caused a budgetary crisis, it has \ndone more than that--it has betrayed a moral responsibility because \nwhen Americans view our actions, they see past the numbers to a set of \nprinciples. They see more than a matter of right and left, they see a \nmatter of right and wrong.\n  Make no mistake, this Balanced Budge Act makes good economic sense. \nBut it also makes us consistent with our highest ideals.\n  That is the moral imperative of this economic debate--the reality \nbeyond the bottom line. But there is, as always, a political imperative \nthat pushes in the opposite direction.\n  Deficit spending has always made political sense. It allows \ngovernment to please people in the present by placing burdens on the \nfuture. The future, significantly, has no vote in the next election.\n  Both the President and Congress have built their power on the ability \nto buy constituent support with cash funded from debt. Republicans and \nsome Democrats in Congress prepared to part with that destructive \npower. The President, it seems obvious, is less willing to surrender \nit--even in this budget crisis, even when the views of most Americans \nare clear, even when so much is at stake.\n  These two imperatives--the moral imperative and the political \nimperative--are struggling against each other at this moment. Never in \nmy career has the choice been more stark or more important.\n  On one side are false numbers and false promises. The President says \nhe favors a balanced budget, but he is willing to shut down the \nGovernment rather than commit to hard deadlines and hard numbers. His \ncommitment during the campaign was a balanced budget in 5 years. Now he \nrefuses to accept 7. And, in reality, because he will not use reliable \nbudget numbers, he rejects any balanced budget at all.\n  With this balanced budget act, we have called the President's bluff. \nAt one point he said he could only accept Congressional Budget Office \nnumbers. His exact quote? ``Let's at least argue about the same set of \nnumbers so the American people will think we're shooting straight with \nthem.'' That is precisely the Republican point: All our talk of a \nbalanced budget is meaningless if we are simply twisting numbers, not \nmaking cuts. This is the exceptional achievement of the Balanced Budget \nAct--it is based on facts, not on hope.\n  The President has already admitted that a balanced budget is possible \nin 7 years. His exact quote? ``There's a way for me to meet the stated \nobjectives, which is a balanced budget in 7 years, with a family tax . \n. .'' But now--faced with a bill that meets this goal--he says that 7 \nyears is too soon.\n  This is the same old political imperative at work--preserve the \nability to buy votes by robbing the future, promise benefits to every \nspecial interest in the country, the most special of all interest, the \nchildren, with no thought for the next generation. That political \nimperative has won every budget debate since the late 1960's. But this \nRepublican budget finally has the courage to confront the political \nimperative--the courage to say that our generation has a moral duty to \nthe next.\n  The Balanced Budget Act is a practical, serious, responsible \nexpression of that moral imperative. It allows us to care for the needs \nof our own society, without adding to the burdens of the future. Even \nthe Washington Post has observed, ``It's gusty and in some respects \ninventive--and it addresses a genuine problem that is only going to get \nworse.''\n  Mr. President, this is a historic piece of legislation--and not just \nfor economic reasons. It allows us in the Congress to leave some legacy \nto the future other than monumental debt--a legacy of moral courage and \nresponsibility. We have waited a long time to make a vote like this--a \nvote to keep our word and keep faith with the next generation.\n  Mr. EXON.

Mr. President, I did not want to speak directly to \nprevious remarks made by my colleague from Nebraska, Senator Bob \nKerrey. I want to highlight them because of the very constructive \nthings that he has said--even, unfortunately, in opposition.\n  Unlike Senator Kerrey, I am very willing and eager to vote for the \nbalanced budget plan before us as it currently stands. This plan \nrepresents the result of months of work and negotiation. It is not \nnecessarily the plan that I would have designed working alone, but we \ndo not have the luxury of working alone. This is the plan before us \nthat has the support of a majority of both Houses of Congress, it's an \nhonest plan, it will do the job, and it is right now our only realistic \nhope of getting the job done, and reducing the debt burden that is \nbeing piled high on the backs of our kids.\n  I do want the Senate to mark what Senator Kerrey has said, because as \nalways, he diagnoses accurately much of what ails us, in the fiscal \nsense. And I am fully sympathetic with many of the choices he would \nmake to bring our fiscal house back into order. That is why I am \npleased to work with him on drafting legislation that will help save \nour country from insolvency in the long run. He and I see eye to eye on \nthis.\n  I do fervently wish that it were possible to make all the reforms \nsuggested by Senator Kerrey in the context of this budget plan. But the \nexisting rules do not work in our favor. For example, the Byrd rule \nforbids any changes in Social Security, even good and necessary ones. I \nfully agree with Senator Kerrey that a five-tenths-of-1-percent \ncorrection in the CPI is necessary and appropriate. to my mind, it is a \n``no brainer''--a simple ``technical correction.'' It makes no sense to \nperpetuate an error which we all know exists. The Senator from Nebraska \nis so absolutely right about that.\n  But my attempts to include the CPI correction were frustrated by the \nfact that it would affect Social Security, and thus violate the Byrd \nrule. I do not like it, I think we should change it, but that's the way \nit is. We should, in my view, change the rules to permit such reforms \nin the future. But for now, we have to work within the rules as they \nare.\n  Similarly, we ought to address the problem of population aging. We \nought to make further shifts upward in eligibility ages for Social \nSecurity and Medicare, and for all programs which give benefits to the \nelderly. But under our current rules, long-term reforms that only \nproduce savings outside the 7-year ``budget window'' are considered \nextraneous. I do not like it, I think it's wrong, but those are the \nlimitations in the current budget process.\n  I mention these things not so simply express disappointment and to \n``howl into the wind'' in the manner of King Lear, but to point out to \nmy colleagues that this is something we can and should change--in the \nfuture. Senator Kerrey and I have a bill to require 30-year budgeting, \nestimates of the 30-year effects of legislative changes. In my view, we \nhave to be able to plan further down the road when we are dealing with \nretirement programs, ``safety-net'' rules that might affect how people \nplan for their own time in retirement. In order to be fair, changes \nmust be announced well in advance. The fact that we only deal with the \nshort-term truly handicaps us as we attempt to make policy that is fair \nand reasoned.\n  I do hope my colleagues will listen closely to Senator Kerrey and to \nme as we discuss the need for ``30-year budgeting.'' Because, the rules \nunder which we operate very much determine the results. I believe that \nthis budget is perhaps the best attainable given the existing budgetary \nrules. But I also believe that we must consider changing the rules to \nforce us to look further down the road--and to examine Social Security \nsolvency, and to stop fooling our countrymen and women.\n  This budget before us is hardly ``harsh'' or ``severe.'' This is a \nsparrow belch in a typhoon. If we cannot get this done, we will never \ndo anything.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, this is an historic day. For the first \ntime in 26 years, the American public will witness the adoption of the \nfirst real balanced budget.\n  And we are going to pass this legislation despite the fact that the \nPresident of the United States has done nothing, I repeat, nothing, to \nmake this task bipartisan. In fact, he has fanned the flames of fear-\nmongering simply to gain what he sees as a political advantage.\n  Just look at his actions and the actions of his Secretary of Treasury \nin the past 10 days. He indicated that he would not sign a continuing \nresolution to reopen the Government because it would have committed him \nto balancing the budget in 7 years.\n  And Treasury Secretary Rubin last week spooked the global markets by \nscaring investors into believing that the United States was facing an \nimminent default on our debt. There was no default; in fact there was \nno chance of a default, and Secretary Rubin knew that.\n  Yet he deceived the American people into believing default would \nhappen if the Republicans did not accept the President's demand that we \nnot go forward with our 7-year balanced budget plan. His actions are \nreprehensible.\n  Emboldened by polls that show many Americans blame Republicans for \nthe Government shutdown, the President would rather maximize political \nadvantage than exercise fiscal leadership. The President mimics \nleadership by standing up to the Republicans and refusing to seek a \nbalanced budget in 7 years.\n  That is not leadership.\n  In fact, it is quite the opposite.\n  When viewed through the lens of history, the President's behavior \nwill be viewed for what it is.\n  A waffle.\n  A retreat.\n  A repudiation of the promise of a balanced budget.\n  What we are offering the President is the first serious effort in two \nand a half decades to put our fiscal house in order.\n  And the President is slamming the door in our face.\n  It is that simple.\n  We are on a pathway to reduce the growth in Federal spending by a \ntrillion dollars--to accomplish what the American people asked us to \ndo.\n  We are doing it without smoke and mirrors.\n  We are doing it with the CBO budget estimates that the President \nhimself asked that we use.\n  We are delivering on a promise made to voters. The President promised \na balanced budget in 5 years; but that's just one of so many campaign \npromises the President abandoned when he walked in the White House.\n  But in keeping our promise, we are attacking the cancer of cynicism \nthat undermines the confidence that Americans have in their leadership, \nand their Government.\n  We are so close to achieving our objectives.\n  Sadly, the President would rather be an instrument of the status quo \nthan a positive force for change.\n  The President would rather flame the fears of older Americans with \nfrightening tales of impending woe than lead us along the path to \nfiscal sanity for the sake of our children.\n  In what I believe is a political miscalculation, the President is \ndeluded by a short term poll that will mean nothing when we are held \naccountable to the people for the end result of our efforts today.\n  Most Americans do not believe we will keep our promise and balance \nthe budget in 7 years.\n  The President apparently wants to prove them right and thus deepen \nthe cynicism that embitters Americans toward their government.\n  And that, Mr. President, endangers far more than our fiscal \nstability.\n   Mr. President, ever since the Republicans unveiled their balanced \nbudget legislative plan during this Spring, the President has been out \ncampaigning against the plan, instilling fear into our most fragile \ncitizens--the elderly.\n  Over and over and over again, there's one message the President has \nbeen drumming into the American people. And that message is that we are \ncutting Medicare.\n   Mr. President, nothing could be further from the truth. And I think \nit's time for the President to stop his demagogic language about \nMedicare.\n  Over the next 7 years Medicare spending will increase from $178 \nbillion to $294 billion--a 65-percent increase, Mr. President. That is \nNOT a cut.\n\n[[Page S 17303]]\n\n  Put another way, spending for each beneficiary will increase from \n$4,800 this year to $7,100 in 2002.\n   Mr. President, let members end the scare tactics on Medicare. Let us \nface the fact that if we do nothing, if we maintain this endless \nborrowing spree, we will bankrupt our children and grandchildren and \nensure that Medicare will go broke in 7 years.\n  I call upon my colleagues and the President.\n  Let us surprise America today.\n  Let us prove that we can balance the budget in 7 years, save \nMedicare, and begin to lift this crippling debt from the shoulders of \nour children and grandchildren.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, Tonight we are choosing between two \npaths for our country. We are defining what kind of country we want to \nbe, and how we are going to meet the challenges of the 21st century.\n  The bill before us offers one type of choice. This bill offers us a \nfuture where we say: No to opportunity in the United States of America. \nNo to economic security for our seniors. No to educational \nopportunities for young people. No to an opportunity structure for \nworking families.\n  Mr. President, I reject that choice. I want a future where we give \nhelp to those who practice self help. I want a future in which senior \ncitizens can have economic security and peace of mind in their \nretirement years. I want a future where young people can get an \neducation that leads to a job and real economic opportunity. I want a \nfuture where we give a helping hand to working Americans who are doing \ntheir best to provide for their families.\n  Let me tell you why I oppose this bill. Yes, I support a balanced \nbudget. But to achieve that we have to put politics and partisanship \naside, and work together to find what I will call the sensible center. \nAnd this bill does not allow for that.\n  This legislation attacks economic security for senior citizens \nthrough cuts in their health care. We need to make Medicare solvent. \nBut this bill would cut Medicare by $270 billion over the next 7 years. \nOnly $90 billion is needed to preserve the solvency of the Medicare \nsystem.\n  What are the rest of the cuts for? They are to pay for tax breaks for \nthe wealthiest of Americans. I reject that.\n  I say let us do what we need to do to make Medicare solvent. But let \nus put tax cuts on hold for a year. We have made so many reductions in \nfederal programs this year. Let us take the time to evaluate the impact \nof those changes. Let us see where we are in 1 year. Then we can take a \nlook at whether we can afford to provide tax cuts. And if in a year we \ndo decide we can provide tax cuts, let's provide them for America's \nworking families. Not for the truly wealthy.\n  I oppose this legislation because it denies educational opportunity \nto young people and an opportunity structure to working families. I \nbelieve we must keep the doors of opportunity open--not slam them shut.\n  Education is the key to a better life. The federal student loan \nprogram has opened the door of opportunity to millions of Americans. \nEducation must be a national priority. It is with me. Unfortunately, it \nis not a priority in this legislation. Under this legislation, the \nstudent loan program will be cut by $5 billion. This is unacceptable to \nme.\n  I oppose this legislation because it increases taxes on working \nfamilies. By cutting the Earned Income Tax Credit, the bill denies help \nto those who practice self help. It seems to me that if we are serious \nabout moving people from public assistance to private employment, the \nfirst step is to make work pay. The EITC makes work pay. It ensures \nthat work is more beneficial for a family than welfare. I will not \nsupport this bills cuts in the EITC program, which amounts to tax \nincreases for working families.\n  Mr. President, make no mistake. We must balance the budget. But we \nmust do it based on principles that preserve economic security for \nsenior citizens, that provide opportunity for young people, and that \nensure opportunity for working families.\n  I cannot and will not support any legislation that abandons these \nprinciples. Therefore, I will vote against this legislation.\n  Mr. COHEN. Mr. President, the moral imperative for balancing the \nbudget is to stop Congress from passing on a mountain of debt to future \ngenerations. Thomas Jefferson reminded us that a generation that spends \nmoney while taxing another ``squanders futurity on a massive scale.''\n  Persistent budget deficits reduce the pool of savings necessary for \ncritical investments in new research, plants and equipment. Virtually \nevery economist agrees that without these investments, standards of \nliving cannot rise. Our collective sin has been the amoral indifference \nwith which we have demanded that our children pay for our \nextravagances, while robbing them of their ability to provide for their \nown subsistence. This is tantamount to fiscal child abuse, a crime for \nwhich there has been no punishment and, perversely, one for which \npoliticians have long been rewarded.\n  Our constituents, in 1994, urged us to stop the pain. Republicans \nproposed to do precisely that. Despite the defeat earlier this year of \na constitutional amendment that would have mandated a balanced budget, \nmy Republican colleagues have passed the first plan in 26 years that \nproduces bottom line equilibrium within a seven-year time frame.\n  I take no issue with the need for deep spending reductions, but I am \nskeptical that we can achieve our goal while cutting taxes \nsimultaneously. It strikes me that this approach rivals driving with \none foot on the gas pedal while the other is on the brake.\n  The Federal Government currently expends far more money than it \ncollects, so that a tax cut can be paid for only by borrowing \nadditional money. Paying for tax cuts with borrowed money is \ncontradictory and self-defeating.\n  Balancing the budget is itself an effective tax cut. Interest on the \nnational debt costs the average household over $800 a year. Balancing \nthe budget more quickly and forgoing a tax cut paid for with borrowed \nmoney would ease the burden of these hidden taxes. Balancing the budget \nmore quickly would also lower interest costs for mortgages and student \nloans--saving families thousands of dollars.\n  I cannot support this conference report because, like the budget plan \nconsidered by the Senate on October 27, it proposes to borrow $245 \nbillion to pay for a tax cut that we cannot now afford. I strongly \nsupport balancing the budget in seven years and realize that this \ncannot be achieved without undertaking some difficult spending cuts. It \nis my hope that Congress and the President can work together on a \nbipartisan balanced budget plan.\n  Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, when nearly 500 college and university \npresidents speak on an issue, Congress should stop and listen. \nYesterday, 472 presidents contacted President Clinton and the \ncongressional leadership to urge that competition be maintained in the \nstudent loan programs. We should listen.\n  Colleges should be able to choose whether to participate in the \ndirect student loan program or the guarantee program. The bill we are \nconsidering this evening does the opposite, forcing 1250 colleges out \nof the direct loan program, and preventing hundreds of others who want \nin from getting in.\n  As my colleagues will see from the list of presidents signing the \nletter, free choice is not only the desire of colleges in the direct \nloan program, but many in the guarantee program as well.\n  It is unfortunate that this issue has become so partisan that some of \nmy colleagues have turned against principles of competition, market \nforces, and the elimination of red tape, and turned toward granting \nmonopolies and entitlements for bankers and middlemen--at the expense \nof students, colleges, and taxpayers.\n  The letter from the college and university presidents speaks for \nitself, and I ask unanimous consent that it be printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, I would also like to respond to a statement \nmade earlier by my colleague from Kansas, who chairs the Labor and \nHuman Resources Committee. She made the statement that the bill we are \nconsidering today makes income-contingent repayment available to all \nstudents.\n\n[[Page S 17304]]\n\n  My colleague is mistaken. The bill gives this option to banks, not to \nstudents. Section 4003(d) of the bill states clearly that this option \nis offered ``at the discretion of the lender.'' In fact, few banks are \nlikely to use this discretion because of the difficulty of confirming \nborrowers' incomes accurately. They also will no longer face the \ncompetition from direct lending, which has caused lenders to be more \nflexible in offering repayment options to borrowers. The reconciliation \nbill not only eliminates schools from direct lending, it also also \nplaces several new obstacles in the way of these borrowers who, under \ncurrent law, can get into direct lending in order to get access to \nincome-contingent repayment.\n  For these reasons, it is likely that fewer borrowers will have access \nto this important repayment option, rather than more borrowers.\n  Mr. President, for these and many other reasons, I urge my colleagues \nto oppose the conference report.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n\n                                American Council on Education,\n\n                                Washington, DC, November 16, 1995.\n     Hon. William Jefferson Clinton,\n     President of the United States, The White House, Washington, \n         DC.\n       Dear Mr. President: In the coming weeks, you and the \n     Congress will decide the fate of one of the most innovative \n     federal student aid programs: the Federal Direct Student Loan \n     Program. We are very concerned about efforts in Congress to \n     limit direct lending, which currently provides about 40 \n     percent of all student loans. We oppose any provision that \n     would arbitrarily limit the ability of schools to participate \n     in direct lending, as we would oppose any effort to force \n     schools into direct lending against their wishes. We ask that \n     in your deliberations with the Congress about the future of \n     federal student loans, you retain institutional choice with \n     regard to the participation of colleges and universities in \n     either the direct student loan or the guaranteed student loan \n     (Federal Family Educational Loan) program.\n       We write as presidents and chancellors of colleges and \n     universities that are currently participating, or plan to \n     participate, in direct lending, as well as those that intend \n     to continue their participation in the guaranteed student \n     loan program. Maintaining the availability of both direct and \n     guaranteed loans is a sound policy that should be preserved, \n     because schools' ability to join either of the two programs \n     has improved the student loan process for all students and \n     schools, regardless of whether or not they participate in \n     direct lending.\n       Those of us who represent colleges and universities already \n     in direct lending can attest to the improvements it has \n     brought about for our institutions. We can report first-hand \n     on the benefits of direct lending for our students: the \n     simplicity of application, the speed of delivery of funds, \n     the disappearance of lines of students waiting to endorse \n     their checks at registration time, the precipitous drop in \n     the number of emergency loans issued to students waiting to \n     hear about their loans from banks and guarantors, and fewer \n     visits to financial aid offices. Students often borrow less \n     under direct lending because they know they can adjust their \n     loan amounts without repeating the entire application \n     process, and therefore only borrow what they believe they \n     need, not the maximum for which they are eligible. Students \n     will also reap the benefits of the income-contingent \n     repayment option, which is only possible through direct \n     leading. At the institutional level, direct lending has \n     eliminated redundant paperwork, reduced staff time allocated \n     to dealing with thousands of lenders and dozens of guarantors \n     and other intermediaries, and vastly improved our overall aid \n     delivery processes because it seamlessly integrates with \n     other federal aid programs.\n       Those of us who represent institutions that are satisfied \n     with the guaranteed student loan program also support the \n     continued availability of the direct loan program to \n     institutions. The competition created by direct lending has \n     induced banks and guarantors to improve the efficiency of \n     their delivery process, and has, for the first time, provided \n     the student loan industry with market-based incentives to \n     provide better service. The guaranteed student loan system \n     has improved more since the phase-in of direct lending two \n     years ago than it did over the more than two decades of its \n     existence prior to 1993. These improvements were brought \n     about by the fact that schools can now select the student \n     loan program that provides them with the best service. \n     Capping or otherwise limiting the direct loan program would \n     undermine the market-based incentives that have so \n     dramatically improved the guaranteed student loan system. The \n     student loan system needs more competition, not less.\n       The current direct lending legislation was enacted as a \n     bipartisan compromise a mere two years ago. Some 1,400 \n     schools, relying in good faith upon what was presented to \n     them as a major federal initiative, have invested substantial \n     institutional resources to implement a program that they \n     believed would better meet the needs of their students. These \n     same schools, and several hundred others that have been \n     planning to join the program in its third year, now confront \n     the prospect of massive disruptions to their financial aid \n     operations and their institutional planning. If direct \n     lending is capped, many of these schools would be required to \n     commit new institutional resources to pay for yet another \n     overhaul of their loan delivery system.\n       Schools now have the option of participating in direct \n     lending or the guaranteed student loan program based on their \n     assessment of which program works best for their students. \n     This has provided a strong incentive to both the Department \n     of Education and to the student loan industry to improve the \n     quality of their service to borrowers and schools. This is \n     precisely the outcome that the bipartisan architects of \n     current direct lending law intended in reforming the student \n     loan system two years ago. We urge you to allow the forces of \n     competition to continue to determine what percentage of the \n     student loan market each program captures by retaining the \n     current direct lending law.\n           Sincerely,\n       Submitted on behalf of the following colleges and \n     universities:\n\n\n                                alabama\n\n       Alabama Agricultural & Mechanical University, Virginia A. \n     Caples, Interim President.\n       Alabama State University, William H.

Womack, \n     Chancellor.\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Mr. President, the Balanced Budget Act of 1995 extends \nthe FCC's auction authority for the first time to any situation in \nwhich the FCC must choose between mutually exclusive applications--\nincluding applications for broadcast facilities. For this reason, Mr. \nPresident, I want to take just a moment to explain the actions and \nintentions of the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation. I \nwant all my colleagues to understand the auction authority extends only \nto mutually exclusive applications for new facilities not already \npending at the FCC.\n  Applications for renewal, modification, or upgrade of existing \nfacilities are not covered under this provision. Similarly, the \ncommittee does not intend--in cases in which an application has already \nbeen accepted by the FCC--that auctions be used to resolve that \nproceeding. I understand that, as the result of a court decision, the \nFCC has not technically accepted certain applications.\n  The committee's intention is that if any application in a proceeding \nhas been accepted, the proceeding will be resolved under the provisions \nof existing law.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, when the roll is called on this budget \nreconciliation conference report, I will be voting yes. But not for \nthis bill.\n  Instead, I will be voting yes for our seniors--yes for our students--\nand yes for the middle class.\n  And I will be voting no on the conference report.\n  I will be voting no on massive Medicare cuts to finance tax breaks \nfor the wealthy.\n  I will be voting no on huge tax breaks for the rich and the special \ninterests.\n  I will be voting no on devastating cuts in nursing home care for \nseniors and the disabled.\n  I will be voting no on increased taxes for working people.\n  I will be voting no on ending the safety net for children.\n  I will be voting no on the basic thrust of this legislation--that we \nmust balance the budget on the backs of working families and senior \ncitizens, while handing out billions in tax breaks for the rich and \npowerful.\n  This bill represents the extremes of the Republican membership.\n  Mr. President, when you get right down to it, this bill forces all of \nus to answer a simple question: ``Whose side are you on?''\n  Are you on the side of middle-class Americans? Are you on the side of \nour senior citizens, of middle-class families struggling to send their \nchildren to college, and of lower income working families?\n  Or are you on the side of the wealthy and the special interests?\n  The Republican reconciliation bill is paydirt for the rich and the \nspecial interests and senior citizens and working class families get \nstuck footing the bills.\n  This is an outrage--and we Democrats are going to fight it as a basic \nmatter of principle.\n  We saw what happened with the continuing resolution when the public \ncaught on to the scheme. Under the spotlight, the Republicans blinked, \nthey retreated, they ran. They wanted to escape the public wrath and \nquickly abandoned their deep principles for political cover.\n  This bill makes the biggest cuts in the history of Medicare.\n  And the Republicans build their case around a false premise.\n  They argue that in order to save Medicare, we must destroy its \nfundamental mission. This is simply not true.\n  And they ought to be honest with the American people about the two \nmajor Republican falsehoods.\n  The first false statement that the Republicans make is that we need \n$270 billion to save Medicare. This is simply untrue.\n  The Republicans are using this $270 billion to finance their $245 \nbillion in tax breaks for the rich folk.\n  It is no coincidence that the Medicare cuts are $270 billion and the \ntax breaks for the wealthy total $245 billion.\n  These figures are remarkably similar because one is being used to \nfinance the other. They are taking from our senior citizens who paid \nthe bills, signed the contract, and weathered the storms. And they're \ngiving it back to the wealthy and the special interests.\n  The second Republican falsehood is that we need to cut $270 billion \nto make Medicare solvent. Not true. The chief HHS Medicare actuary has \nstated that we only need $89 billion in savings to make Medicare \nsolvent until the end of 2006.\n  Mr. President, let me just give you some examples of what kind of tax \nbreaks these Medicare cuts are paying for:\n  Under this bill, approximately 2,000 large corporations will get a \ntax break of $2 million each because of changes in the alternative \nminimum tax. This is outrageous.\n  In addition, this bill contains hundreds of millions of dollars in \ngiveaways to oil companies.\n  Finally, the capital gains tax cut included in this bill is a tax \nbreak for the super rich. Anyone can claim this tax break. Even \nmillionaires and billionaires can get this tax break.\n  Mr. President, I tried to draw a line on the tax breaks and put the \nmoney \n\n[[Page S 17309]]\nback into Medicare and Medicaid. I offered an amendment to the \nreconciliation bill that would have precluded the tax breaks from going \nto those who make over $1 million per year. That's the top one-tenth of \none percent of all taxpayers.\n  I thought this amendment would pass unanimously. I thought that we \nall could agree that millionaires and billionaires do not need a tax \nbreak when we are cutting Medicare--especially when 75 percent of all \nMedicare recipients earn under $25,000 per year.\n  But no--52 of the 53 Republican Senators voted against my amendment. \nIn essence, they voted to cut Medicare to provide tax breaks for \nmillionaires and billionaires.\n  Mr. President, Medicare is not just a health insurance program. \nMedicare is a commitment that we have made to our citizens. It is a \npromise--for those who work hard their entire lives--that your medical \nneeds will be taken care of when you retire.\n  But this Republican budget uses the Medicare Program as a slush fund \nfor the tax breaks for the wealthy.\n  I urge my colleagues to say no to Medicare cuts to pay for tax breaks \nfor the rich.\n  Let's reject the Republican budget reconciliation bill--let's start \nover.\n  We can put together a compromise bill that moves toward a balanced \nbudget but does not destroy our Medicare Program. But this is not such \na bill.\n  Unfortunately, this is a bill that sticks it to ordinary Americans, \nand lavishes huge breaks for the rich and the special interests. I \nthink that's wrong.\n  I say: It's time, for once, to put the middle class first and defeat \nthis bill.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, for the information of the Senate, I \nwould like to discuss with the chairman of the Committee on Energy and \nNatural Resources, Mr. Murkowski, the provisions of the Budget \nReconciliation Conference Report that relate to the sale of oil from \nthe Weeks Island Strategic Petroleum Reserve storage facility. This \nfacility is located in Louisiana.\n  I say to Chairman Murkowski, a provision of the conference report \nrequires the sale by the Department of Energy of oil from the Weeks \nIsland facility. It is my understanding that the Weeks Island facility \nhas suffered irreparable damage from one and perhaps two fractures, and \nthat oil within this facility is in danger of leaking into Louisiana's \nunderground aquifer. It is also my understanding that as a result of \nthese fractures, the oil contained in Weeks Islands must be removed and \nthe facility decomissioned. Is that correct?\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, the Senator from Texas is correct. The \nleaks she refers to require the oil contained in the Weeks Island \nfacility to be removed, and the facility to be decommissioned. There is \nno choice, and the Department of Energy already has that process \nunderway. It is only with the greatest hesitancy that we are requiring \nthe sale of any oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. As the \nSenator from Texas knows, the Strategic Petroleum Reserve is essential \nfor the protection of our energy security in the event of oil supply \ninterruption, such as the ones we suffered through in 1973 and 1979. \nThat is why the conference report contains provisions which provide \nfunding for the replacement of this oil in the Strategic Petroleum \nReserve.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. I thank the Chairman for that response. I would also \nlike to know if the conference report contains any language to assure \ndomestic oil producers, particularly independents located in the State \nof Texas, that the sale of this oil will not be done by the Department \nof Energy in such a manner as to disrupt the oil market or to adversely \naffect oil prices?\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, the answer to the Senator's question is \nyes. When the oil is sold from the Weeks Island facility, which is \nlocated in Louisiana, the Department of Energy is directed to so do in \na manner that does not disrupt the marketplace or have any noticeable \nimpact on prices. Perhaps the best thing to do is to quote from the \nstatutory language contained in conference report: ``The Secretary \nshall, to the greatest extent practical, sell oil from the reserve in a \nmanner that minimizes the impact of such sales upon supply levels and \nmarket forces.''.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I thank Senator Murkowski.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I have been listening with a great deal of \ninterest to the speakers on both sides of the aisle as the Balanced \nBudget Act of 1995 has been discussed. Although the President has \nindicated that he will veto this conference report when he receives it, \nI am proud to support this document which follows through on our \ncommitment to balance the Nation's budget by the year 2002, protect \nSocial Security, and save Medicare from threatened bankruptcy. America \nhas not had a balanced budget in over a quarter century.\n  While we are apparently debating a bill that has no future, there \nwill be successor after successor with the same basic goals until we \nwin. Yes, this will get a veto from the President, but at the same \ntime, it will signal the beginning of a final dialog with the \nadministration on a final Balanced Budget Act of 1995.\n  America's financial markets have reflected the approval of the \nRepublican efforts during the past week. The phone calls and fax \nmessages from my constituents statewide have overwhelmingly supported \nthe position taken by Republicans and reflected in this package. As I \nindicated when the Senate considered this bill, this is not just a \nbudget for another year. This is not a package of routine legislative \nchanges. This is a historic commitment to America that deficit spending \nis about to come to an end, no later than the year 2002, and it has \nbeen brought about during the first year of the Republican majority in \nthe Congress.\n  The net result of a balanced budget will be lower interest rates for \nyears to come, and as many as 6 million new jobs. The reforms in this \nbill will give the States more control over critical entitlement \nprograms. I strongly support these initiatives which will let the \nStates decide how best to serve their own citizens. What is best for my \nState of Virginia is not necessarily the same as what is best for \nanother State, and this balanced budget act will move power and money \nout of Washington, back to State governments and local communities \nwhere it belongs.\n  When this balanced budget act is finally signed into law, and it will \nbe, we will have identified the path, but each year we will have to \nmake spending decisions that will keep us on the road that is being \ndefined here today. If emergencies occur, we will have to offset their \ncosts with spending reductions. Those budget decisions will be as \ndifficult in the year 2000 as they are this year, but this conference \nreport is a commitment by the Republicans, and eventually, by the \nentire Congress, that we will stay the course.\n  This is a momentous vote, and I urge my colleagues to roll up your \nsleeves, get ready for hard work, and pass this balanced budget act. \nThe Republican train is here, and it is time to get aboard for a trip \nto fiscal responsibility. We have made the commitment to America and we \nwill carry through on it.\n\n\n                         nursing home standards\n\n  Mr. COHEN. Mr. President, I rise to comment on the need to strengthen \nour commitment to strong nursing home standards in the budget \nreconciliation bill before us. The conference report on the budget bill \nhas come a long way toward restoring current Federal nursing home \nstandards and strong Federal and State enforcement of protections for \nnursing home residents. It represents a considerable improvement over \nthe House bill that retreated from Federal standards and enforcement \nand reflects much of the Senate position on nursing home standards, but \nwe are not there yet.\n  Many patient advocacy groups and colleagues from the other side of \nthe aisle have come forward to assail the nursing home provisions \nincluded in this bill, but I would ask them to pause for a moment to \nrecognize that significant headway we have made in the debate over \nFederal nursing home standards. The debate is no longer over the need \nfor national standards and Federal oversight of nursing homes, but over \nwhat national standards are necessary to be maintained. I remain \ncautious of several of the changes made in conference agreement which \ncould undermine the improvements nursing home residents and their \nfamilies have witnessed since the enactment of the \n\n[[Page S 17310]]\nOBRA 87 regulations, but I recognize the substantial progress that has \nbeen made.\n\n  Specifically, I am concerned about provisions of the bill allowing \nnursing homes to be accredited by private sector organizations as a way \nof meeting State certification requirements. In the past, private \naccreditation has been perceived as a loophole for facilities to avoid \noversight, In order for accreditation to be acceptable, we must be sure \nthat the Federal and State governments retain full authority to monitor \nfacilities and that standards and residents' rights are not \ncompromised.\n  I also have reservations about several changes that have been made to \ncurrent law. For example the bill eliminates current regulations that \nrestrict a nursing home from placing extra requirements on Medicaid \npatients as a condition of admission, such as denying a Medicaid bed \nunless a gift, payment, or donation is given to the facility. Without \nthe current admission policy limitations, patients and their family \nmembers will no longer be protected against discrimination based on \nsource of payment and duration of stay contracts.\n  It also removes the requirement that facilities provide care and \nservices to allow each resident to attain or maintain his or her \nhighest practicable level of physical mental, and psychosocial \nfunctioning. While this standard may sound a bit abstract, it was a key \nphrase negotiated in the OBRA 87 requirements to encourage nursing \nfacilities to provide the best possible to nursing home residents.\n  It reduces the frequency of required inspections of nursing homes \nfrom every year to every 2 years unless the facility has been found to \nhave substandard care; eliminates the requirement for comprehensive \ntraining for State and Federal surveyors; removes requirement that \nresident assessments be conducted using a national uniform data set in \norder to monitor patient outcomes and consistency in patient care; \nrelaxes protections against unfair transfers and discharge of nursing \nhome residents; reduces some minimum training and staffing requirements \nfor nursing homes--including elimination of 75 hours of training for \nnurse aides and the requirement that facilities with more than 120 beds \nemploy a qualified social worker.\n  Also, it reduces the frequency of mandated Federal validation surveys \non 5 per cent every year to 5 per cent every 3 years; removes \nrequirement directing surveyors to reduce the time between \nidentification of standards violations and the final imposition of \nremedies; eliminates language calling for incrementally more severe \nfines for repeated or uncorrected deficiencies; reduces maximum civil \nmonetary penalty imposed on nursing homes that are out of compliance \nfrom $10,000 to $5,000; and eliminates language requiring retroactive \ncivil monetary penalties for past noncompliance.\n  The conference agreement on nursing home protections has come a long \nway toward restoring the goal of full protections for millions of \nnursing home residents nationwide, but certain critical issues remain \nunresolved. I will continue to evaluate the changes proposed by the \nconferees and will work with the leadership and consumer groups to \nguarantee adequate protection for elderly and disabled nursing home \nresidents.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the Balanced \nBudget Act of 1995, which, for the first time in many years, proposes a \nbudget that controls entitlement spending, restrains the growth of \nGovernment, and eliminates annual deficits.\n  For years I have made speeches in this great Chamber, and cast my \nvote in support of a balanced budget. I have introduced balanced budget \namendments in numerous sessions of Congress, including the 104th \nCongress. On July 12, 1982, a balanced budget amendment was brought to \nthe floor. As Chairman of the Judiciary Committee, I was pleased to \nsponsor and guide that important measure to passage. On August 4, 1982, \n69 Senators voted in favor of the resolution. While a majority \nsupported it in the House, if failed to receive the necessary two-\nthirds vote. In March 1986, the Senate voted on another balanced budget \namendment. It was unfortunate that the resolution failed by one vote. \nEarlier this year, the balanced budget amendment again failed by one \nvote. However, I am confident that we will yet pass the balanced budget \namendment during the 104th Congress.\n  With or without a constitutional amendment, this balanced budget act \nproves that the Congress can enact a budget which protects the health \nand safety of our Nation, provides quality Government services, and \neliminates harmful deficits.\n  This is a refreshing contrast to the unbalanced budgets proposed by \nthe President. His budgets contain no plan to balance the budget, \nsignificantly increase the national debt, fail to restrain growth in \nnondefense Government spending, and propose dangerous reductions in \nnational defense spending. Mr. President, such budgets are not \nacceptable alternatives.\n  The Balanced Budget Act of 1996 reverses direction on those policies \nwhich are stifling our economy and burdening all Americans with an \noverwhelming national debt. It puts the Nation on track to reduce \nGovernment spending, eliminate annual deficits, and permits us to begin \nto reduce the national debt, which is now nearly $5 trillion.\n  First, this bill controls the growth rate of Government spending. \nFederal spending continues to increase over the 7-year budget period, \nfrom $1.5 trillion in 1995 to nearly $1.9 trillion in fiscal year 2002. \nHowever, this spending growth is at a slower, more affordable rate, and \nbelow the growth rate of Federal revenues. By 2002, revenues will \nexceed spending.\n  One would think, listening to this debate, that this budget \ndrastically reduces or eliminates all Federal programs. For example, it \nhas been argued by some that proposed reductions would destroy Medicare \nand Medicaid. This simply is not the case. Both programs grow at \nhealthy annual rates. Without the proposed reforms, these programs \nwould grow at unsustainable rates, resulting in dangerous consequences, \neven threatening the solvency of the Medicare part A trust fund.\n  Second, Mr. President, the balanced budget act reduces and eventually \neliminates annual deficits, which is the amount Government outlays \nexceed Government revenues. Without this bill, annual deficits will \ncontinue to increase, exceeding $200 billion per year. By enacting this \nmeasure, annual deficits will begin a downward path and will be \neliminated within the 7-year budget period. The Congressional Budget \nOffice estimates a surplus by 2002, allowing us to begin reducing the \nnational debt.\n  The results of this deficit reduction, Mr. President, have been \nestimated to stimulate economic growth, reduce interest rates, increase \nemployment opportunities, and result in a higher standard of living for \nall Americans.\n  Mr. President, in addition to controlling Government spending, this \nbalanced budget act addresses Government revenues. Under this bill, \nGovernment revenues will continue to increase. However, in contrast to \nthe 1993 Budget Reconciliation Act which enacted the largest tax \nincrease in history, the balanced budget act will let American families \nkeep more of what they earn.\n  Let me emphasize, Mr. President, this bill provides tax relief for \nthe middle class. Over four-fifths of the tax reductions of this \nproposal will go to those making under $100,000; nearly two-thirds go \nto those making under $75,000. Furthermore, after considering all the \nreforms of the earned income tax credit, the marriage penalty, and the \nchild tax credit, working families with children will see their taxes \ndecrease next year.\n  The centerpiece of the revenue provision is the family tax credit, \noffering a $500 per child tax credit, for children under the age of 18. \nThis credit is phased out for individuals with adjusted gross income \nover $75,000, or for married couples with an income over $110,000. In \nmy State of South Carolina, this means that over 400,000 tax returns \nwill be eligible to claim this credit, at a value of over $320 million. \nThis is money directly in the hands of parents to spend for their \npriorities--child care, housing, and education--not sent to Washington \nto fund its bloated bureaucracy.\n  Other provisions provide direct relief to America's families, \nincluding a $5000 adoption tax credit; marriage penalty \n\n[[Page S 17311]]\nrelief; and a credit for student loan interest.\n  The bill also contains revenue provisions which will increase savings \nand investment. The expansion of the individual retirement account will \npermit more Americans to save more money for their retirement years. \nThe capital gains reduction will unlock existing capital assets, \nallowing capital to be reinvested. This will result in more jobs, \nhigher wages, more benefits, and a more vibrant economy.\n  Let me address the argument that the capital gains tax cut will go \nprimarily to the rich. A study by the U.S. Treasury showed that nearly \none-half of all capital gains were realized by taxpayers with wage and \nsalary income of less than $50,000. Three-fourths of all returns with \ncapital gains in 1995 are estimated to be reported by taxpayers with \nwage and salary income of $50,000 or less. Mr. President, let me \nreemphasize this point--capital gains tax relief will benefit all \nAmericans.\n  Mr. President, there are many other important and favorable \nprovisions in the balanced budget act. The act reforms welfare by \nemphasizing work and responsibility. It preserves, protects and \nimproves Medicare. It protects veterans' benefits and safeguards \naffordable education.\n  Mr. President, I support the Balanced Budget Act of 1995. I vote \n``yes'' for reducing the deficit; I vote ``yes'' for controlling the \ngrowth of Government spending; I vote ``yes'' for our families by \nreducing their tax burden; I vote ``yes'' for restoring the economic \nfuture of our Nation. Therefore, I will vote ``yes'' for this bill and \nencourage my colleagues to do likewise. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President. The Committee on Energy and Natural \nResources met and exceeded its targets for the conference. I want to \nexpress my appreciation to Chairman Young of the House Resources \nCommittee and to Chairman Bliley of the House Commerce Committee for \ntheir cooperation, and the hard work of their staff, that enabled us to \nconclude our negotiations quickly and in an amicable fashion.\n  When the President submitted his budget earlier this year, he \nproposed to sell the Power Marketing Administrations, except for \nBonneville, to the present customers at the discounted value of the \nrepayment obligations. That proposal was not particularly well thought \nout as our hearings in committee demonstrated. Nonetheless, the revenue \nassumptions underlying that sale became part of the target and \ninstructions given to our committee. While the members of our committee \nrecognize that serious attention needs to be given to the future of the \nPMA's, especially in light of declining budgets for the agencies that \ncurrently manage the generating and marketing of power from Federal \nfacilities, we also are in agreement that responsible solutions are \nsimply not possible within the time frame of Reconciliation. The \ncommittee was faced with a Herculean task of finding other options to \nachieve the savings scored to our committee. The magnitude of the task \nis best illustrated by a comment from one of the staff on the Budget \nCommittee that if they had known of other options, we would have been \nscored with them as well.\n  As I stated, the committee has met and exceeded its instructions. I \nwant to express my appreciation to our ranking Minority Member, Senator \nJohnston, for his cooperation and the assistance from his staff in \nhelping us. Our committee has always prided itself on its bipartisan \nprofessional approach to legislation, and that is demonstrated in our \nproduct.\n  The conference agreement includes the sale of certain lands in \nCalifornia contained in the House measure as well as the sale of the \nhelium reserves contained in both the Senate and the House.\n  The agreement also contains the leasing authority for the Coastal \nPlain in Alaska that was contained in both the Senate and House \nversions and which was a specific assumption in our instructions. The \nconferees made several minor changes to make the program work more \nefficiently and resolved uncertainties in allotments due Alaskan \nnatives within the Coastal Plain. I know that some opponents of the \nprogram have suggested that the Federal Government will never see the \nrevenues estimated from leasing on the Coastal Plain due to the \nprovision in the Mineral Leasing Act made by the Alaska Statehood Act \nthat provides 90 percent of all revenues to the State. The statement of \nmanagers is explicit on this subject. We are not in any manner altering \nthe provisions in the Alaska Statehood Act nor the Mineral Leasing Act. \nThose provisions continue to apply in Alaska outside the Coastal Plain. \nWhen Congress set aside the Coastal Plain, it reserved to itself the \ndecision on whether the area should be opened to leasing or not, and if \nso, under what terms and conditions.\n  The decision has been that the area should be leased, but that it \nshould be leased under very specific conditions tailored to the unique \ncharacteristics of the Coastal Plain. Suggestions that development will \nhave adverse environmental effects are wrong and the result of either \nmisinformation, misunderstanding, or deliberate mischaracterization. \nOur committee has spent several years crafting very specific language \nto ensure that development will occur in an environmentally sensitive \nmanner, and that language is incorporated in the conference agreement. \nIn developing a separate leasing program for the Coastal Plain, the \ncommittee decided to adopt a 50-50 revenue sharing formula. The \nconference language is absolutely clear that the program set forth is \nthe sole authority for the leasing program, not the Mineral Leasing \nAct.\n  I will have more to say about this leasing program, but for the \nmoment I simply want to say that I sincerely hope that the President \nwould stop listening to the ideological fanatics that prowl the White \nHouse and the Federal agencies and examine the realities of this \nleasing program. This Nation is once again over 50 percent dependent on \nforeign oil supplies. That doesn't seem to bother the President, but it \nshould. The President should reexamine his position on this issue. His \nopposition is wrong from the standpoint of our energy security, it is \nwrong from the standpoint of the economy, it is wrong from the \nstandpoint of the environment, it is wrong from a budget standpoint, it \nis wrong from the standpoint of domestic employment, it is wrong from \nthe standpoint of our responsibilities for Native Alaskans--his \nopposition is simply wrong.\n  The conference agreement also includes various reclamation and water \nprovisions. The agreement retains the Senate language repealing a \nprohibition in current law that prevents irrigation districts from \nprepaying their outstanding debt. The legislation also provides for the \ntransfer of the Collbran Project in Colorado, and Senator Campbell \ndeserves the credit for working out the problems with that provision. \nThe agreement also includes a modification to the Raker Act that would \nincrease the payment by San Francisco for the use of a portion of \nYosemite National Park from $30,000 to $2 million. The charge has not \nbeen changed in over half a century. The House had set the charge at $8 \nmillion while the Senate had adopted a formula used by FERC with a \nfloor of $597,000. The Agreement also includes two provisions of the \nHouse version--the transfer of Sly Park and authorization for \nprepayment of Central Utah Project debt--with minor modifications.\n\n  After considerable discussion with the House, we also were able to \ncome to agreement on amendments dealing with Federal oil and gas \nroyalties and hardrock mining. The reforms will increase Federal \nreceipts and provide a fair and workable system that will increase \ncollections from oil and gas operations and completely reform the \nfederal hardrock mining program. I fully understand that the provisions \ndealing with hardrock mining will not satisfy those whose prime \nmotivation is the elimination of any domestic mining industry, but that \nwas not our objective. The provisions of the Conference Agreement \nrecognize private property rights, provide for fair market value with a \nreverter for patents, and impose a royalty on future production.\n  The conference agreement includes the Senate provisions dealing with \nprivatization of Department of the Interior aircraft services, with \ncertain modifications as well as the sale of the Alaska Power \nAdministration, refinancing of the Bonneville Power Administration, \nexport of Alaska oil, and \n\n[[Page S 17312]]\nOCS deepwater royalty relief, all of which were included in the \nconference agreement on S. 295 which both the Senate and House have \napproved and the President supports.\n  After considerable work, the conferees were able to agree on \nprovisions dealing with ski area permits, National Park Service \nconcessions, and recreation fees at areas administered by the National \nPark Service, Bureau of Land Management, and the Forest Service. We \nwere able to retain the Senate provision that would return 80 percent \nof all new receipts to the collecting agency for direct use for visitor \nservices and facilities.\n  The conferees also agreed to the language that markedly improves the \nclimate for the privatization of the U.S. Enrichment Corporation. We \nalso included language providing for the disposal of surplus property \nby the Department of Energy and for the lease of excess storage \ncapacity within the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. As a result of \nproblems at the Weeks Island site, the reserves need to be drawn down \nand relocated. The conferees agreed that 32 million barrels of the \nreserve should be sold, but that 50 percent of the revenues from the \nlease of excess capacity should be made available for additional \npurchases to complete the reserve beginning in 2002.\n  Mr. President, none of this could have been accomplished without long \nhours and hard work by the professional staff of the committee. I want \nto express my appreciation to them. Howard Useem worked on the Alaska \nPower Administration sale and the Bonneville refinancing as well as the \nStrategic Petroleum Reserve language. Brian Malnak worked on the \nInterior asset sales, Mike Poling worked on the oil and gas royalty and \nOCS provisions, and Jim O'Toole worked on the National Park Service \nfees and concessions language. Jonathan Schneeweiss made major \ncontributions in trying to keep our provisions straight, and I want to \nespecially express my gratitude to the support staff, Camille Heninger, \nBetty Nevitt, Jo Meuse, Kelly Fischer, Judy Brown, Julia Gustafson, and \nGerry Gentry--who really did all the work.\n  I also want to thank the minority staff who demonstrated the high \nlevel of professional commitment that has always characterized our \nstaff. During the last reconciliation measure, they sought to involve \nus and we tried to be helpful. We are grateful for their assistance \nthis time around. Ben Cooper, Tom Williams, David Brooks, Shirley Neff, \nBob Simon and Cliff Sikora all made important contributions. I \nespecially want to thank Sam Fowler for his assistance and ready \nrecourse to humour during tense moments. In addition to his overall \nresponsibilities for the entire package, his work on the U.S. \nEnrichment Corporation was invaluable.\n  Although all the staff performed well, some made extraordinary \ncontributions. I want to acknowledge Karen Hunsicker, who shepherded \nthe conference wit the House Commerce committee to an early and \nsuccessful conclusion, especially on the U.S. Enrichment Corporation \nand DOE asset sales. David Garman did outstanding work on the US \nEnrichment Corporation and Andrew Lundquist has labored long and hard \non both the Alaska export provisions and the leasing program for the \nCoastal Plain of the Arctic Refuge. Michael Flannigan made the hardrock \nmining negotiations as exciting as possible and kept a degree of \nuncertainty up to the very last moment. Kayci Cook, the Committee's \nBevinetto Fellow, demonstrated competence, patience, and professional \njudgment in working on concessions and park fees.\n  Finally, I want to express my appreciation to the senior staff of the \nCommittee--Gregg Renkes, our Staff Director, Gary Ellsworth, our Chief \nCounsel, and Jim Beirne, our Senior Counsel. Not only have they handled \nindividual portions of the package with their usual professional \nexpertise, but they have also had the pleasure of dealing with the \nBudget Committee, the Congressional Budget Office, the Parliamentarian, \nLegislative Counsel, and their House counterparts, as well as various \nSenators and staff. They handled the floor procedures, and made certain \nthat all the members of the committee were covered, and are responsible \nfor the successful completion of the conference.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, yesterday, on his birthday, a young member \nof my staff went to the dentist for a root canal. He understood that \nlong-term health and comfort was more than worth the short-term \ndiscomfort.\n  Ironically, the same day, I received a fax from a concerned taxpayer \nwho pointed out that a dentist's ``polling numbers'' aren't too good \nwhile the cavity is being drilled. But once the cavity is filled, ``the \nhorrible toothache is gone forever--and the patient is grateful.''\n  For many of us in Congress, for Government employees, for many \nIdahoans, and for many folks watching us around the Nation, the current \nbudget impasse may be producing a feeling like that of hearing the \ndentist's drill.\n  So, it's important for us to remember why we're here, what's at stake \nhere, and why we are fighting so hard to pass a balanced budget.\n  $200 billion annual deficits, a $5 trillion debt, are more than a \ntoothache--they are a cancer on the economy and threaten the living \nstandards and economic security of every American.\n  This would be the first balanced budget since 1969 and only the \nsecond since 1960. It's sobering to remember that a majority of \nAmericans living today have seen the Government balance its books \neither once or never.\n  Back at the beginning of this year, we got 66 of the 67 votes we \nneeded to pass the Balanced Budget Amendment to the Constitution. The \ncritics, the defenders of the status quo cried out, ``Where's your \nplan?'' Well, at least for those of us on this side of the aisle, \nhere's our plan.\n  With passage today of the Balanced Budget Act, the first Republican \nCongress in 40 years is on the verge of passing a detailed plan to \nbalance the Federal budget by the year 2002--for the first time since \n1969 and only the second time since 1960. In fact, a majority of all \nAmericans living today have seen the Government balance its books only \nonce or never. However, the President has threatened a veto and the \ndebate has been heated and, often, confusing or misleading. The \nfollowing information should help folks construct the true picture of \nthe current debate and what's at stake.\n  Democrats say Republicans in Congress want to slash spending. But \ntotal spending under the Balanced Budget Plan will go from $1.5 \ntrillion in 1995 to almost $1.9 trillion in 2002--a 22 percent \nincrease.\n  Under the status quo, spending would go to $2.1 trillion in 2002--\nalmost a 40 percent increase.\n  The Democrats say the Republican budget is all pain, no gain. But \nreal people will enjoy real benefits from balancing the budget by 2002 \nunder the Republican plan. Because of lower interest rates, a typical \nfamily would save $2,388 a year on a $75,000 mortgage; $1,026 over the \nlife of a 4-year, $15,000 car loan; and $1,891 over the life of a 10-\nyear, $11,000 student loan.\n  Balancing the budget means more investment, more economic growth, and \n2.5 million new jobs by 2002. By 2020, this growth means our children \nwould have a 7 percent to 36 percent higher standard of living.\n  In contrast: The Concord Coalition estimates that Federal debts and \ndeficits already have lowered the average family's income by $15,000 a \nyear. The President's 1995 budget estimated that future generations \nface a lifetime tax rate of 82 percent at all levels, under current \ntrends in the public debt. The status quo is the least tolerable \ncourse.\n  President Clinton says he has submitted a balanced budget. Not \naccording to the nonpartisan, objective Congressional Budget Office, \nwhich said the ``10-year balanced budget plan'' he offered this summer \nactually would produce $200 billion deficits a year throughout the next \ndecade. By his own admission, the budget the President first proposed \nin February would have produced similar $200 billion deficits. In both \ncases, he used unrealistic economic assumptions.\n\n  Democrats say the Congressional budget plan will drastically reduce \nMedicare protection for the elderly. But, if we do nothing, Medicare \nwill run a deficit in the coming year for the first time ever, and its \ntrust funds will be completely drained of their accumulated reserve by \n2002. The official Medicare Trustees--including three of President \nClinton's own Cabinet Secretaries--have said so.\n\n[[Page S 17313]]\n\n  The balanced budget plan will extend the financial solvency of \nMedicare at least until 2009, protecting seniors. Budget savings would \ncome from increasing consumer choice and making the system more \nefficient. Even after savings, Medicare spending per beneficiary would \nincrease from $4,800 in 1995 to $6,700 in 2002--a 40-percent increase.\n  Democrats say Republicans want to cut Medicare to pay for tax cuts. \nBut, the same magnitude of reforms are necessary to save and preserve \nMedicare, no matter what happens with the rest of the budget. The \nBalanced Budget Act includes a lockbox provision making it illegal to \nuse Medicare funds for other purposes.\n  Democrats say the Republican plan won't really balance the budget--it \nwill look like it by raiding the Social Security trust funds. But, the \nbalanced budget plan will balance the unified budget (including Social \nSecurity surpluses in the total) by 2002. It will balance the budget \nwithout counting Social Security by 2005. The Government will remain \nunder a legal obligation to pay out to Social Security beneficiaries \nevery dollar ever deposited into the Social Security trust funds, with \ninterest.\n  The growing national debt is the real threat to Social Security and \nevery other important Government program. We already are paying $300 \nbillion in interest every year on that debt--about one-fifth of it \ngoing to foreigners--which crowds out other budget priorities.\n  Democrats say the Congressional budget is full of tax cuts for the \nrich. But, every time someone suggests cutting taxes for everyone, \nliberal demagogues make it sound like the rich are getting a special \ndeal. It just ain't so in the balanced budget plan.\n  Almost three-quarters of the tax package in the budget goes for \nfamily tax relief, including a $500 per-child credit, adoption credit, \nmarriage penalty relief, a deduction for custodial care for the \nelderly, and a student loan interest deduction. Savings and investment \nincentives will boost the entire economy, create jobs, and guarantee \nthat small businesses and family farms won't have to be sold at the \nowner's death just to pay taxes. Closing corporate loopholes will raise \n$18 billion in revenues over the next 7 years.\n  Democrats say the Republican budget raises taxes on lower-income \npeople. This accusation is a misrepresentation about the Earned Income \nTax Credit [EITC]. The EITC is the fastest-growing item in the budget. \nIt is part tax credit and part spending program for lower-income \nworkers. In his 1993 budget, President Clinton drastically expanded \nwho's eligible and the amount of benefits.\n  The Balanced Budget Act would preserve currently-scheduled EITC \nincreases for needy families with children. Coordinating the EITC with \nthe $500 per-child credit will still give EITC families earning more \nthan $18,000 a net tax cut. Other reforms target fraud, which would \ncost $37 billion over the next 5 years under current law. The only \nactual benefit reductions would affect childless taxpayers (who, before \n1993, were never eligible for the EITC), illegal aliens, tax cheats, \nand affluent taxpayers (who never should have received EITC benefits).\n  Democrats say Republicans want to cut benefits to the poor and needy. \nBut Medicaid (health care insurance for the needy) spending in the \nBalanced Budget Act would go from $89 billion in 1995 to $127 billion \nin 2002--a 43-percent increase.\n  Mr. President, here is some rhetoric versus the truth.\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. President, what an extraordinary and remarkable day. \nWe are all somewhat weary--and, yes, greatly frustrated--from events of \nthe past few days. But we should not let our fatigue--or our \nfrustration from dealing with politicos at the other end of \nPennsylvania Avenue--diminish the importance of the moment.\n  At the close of this debate, we will be privileged to vote on a \nbudget which--get this, for the very first time in my 17 years here--\nactually balances the budget on a date certain. No more smoke and \nmirrors! No tricks. No more accept short term expedients now--with the \nunderstanding that necessary trimming will follow later. We have \nfinally learned better; finally, we do understand. And, finally, we are \nactually going to do it! We are going to balance this budget! A good \nday!\n  Everyone in this chamber knows my views on the subject of a balanced \nbudget. Everyone knows that I passionately believe that the one way--\nthe only way--to get to a balanced budget is to gain control over this \nso-called entitlement spending. That's a belief borne of very careful \nstudy--study which Senator Bob Kerry and I undertook in service on the \nEntitlement Reform Commission.\n  But the view that we must gain control over entitlement spending in \norder to balance the budget is not merely a belief. At this point, I \nthink all Senators might agree that, as a matter of absolute fact, \nentitlement spending reform is the only way we can get from here to \nthere. The fact that all now seem to agree on that point--and on the \npoint that we must stop borrowing indefinitely from future \ngenerations--shows how far we, and the American people, have come in \njust a few years. I wish this consensus might have arrived sooner, but \nI'm surely pleased it is here now.\n  In light of the relative consensus on the ``big picture,'' and in \nview of the limited time available for us to debate this historic \nBalanced Budget Act, I will not talk long on the overarching issues. \nBut I will say this: we are taking an action today which comes closer \nthan anything we could ever do--short of voting on a war resolution--to \ndetermining the day-to-day quality of life of future generations of \nAmericans. This is not hyperbole or overstatement. This is not hype or \nhoorah! Without the action we take today, our grandchildren, and their \nchildren, face a future of bankruptcy, hyperinflation, and financial \nand fiscal chaos. By taking some relatively painless steps today--and, \nplease, let's be honest on this point: the savings we will approve \ntoday are relatively painless when you consider the magnitude of the \ndeficit and debt confronting us--we deflect away that otherwise \ncertain, and bleak, future.\n  The savings measures we will approved today are relatively painless--\nso much so that it is amazing, and so regrettable, that we have waited \nso long to act. To illustrate, let me outline for you what the \nCommittee on Veterans Affairs--the Committee I am honored to Chair--has \napproved. I think you will agree that the route to a balanced budget \nthat the Veterans Committee was able to reach imposes no great hardship \non the Nation's veterans.\n  Title X of the bill--entitled ``Veterans and Related Provisions''--\ndefines what veterans must contribute to help us achieve a balanced \nbudget. The measures we have approved can be viewed in three clusters:\n  First, we would reenact a number of money saving provisions that have \npreviously been approved in prior Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Acts--\n  We would continue, for example, to require that some, but only some, \nveterans pay small per diems for hospital and outpatient care, and \nsmall added co-payments for prescription medications dispensed for the \ntreatment of non-service-connected disabilities; veterans with profound \nservice-connected disabilities, and low income veterans, would continue \nto be exempted.\n  We would continue, with respect to VA-treated veterans who have \nhealth insurance, to authorize VA to collect fees from those insurance \ncarriers for non-service-connected treatment.\n  We would continue to allow VA to ``verify,'' through access to IRS \nand Social Security records, the incomes of veterans who apply for \nmeans-tested VA benefits.\n  We would continue to limit means-tested VA payments to veterans who \nare in Medicaid-financed nursing home care while still assuring \ncompletely that the real benefit paid to, and retained by, the veteran \nis not diminished.\n  We would continue to require that veterans who receive the benefits \nof VA mortgage loan guarantees pay reasonable fees.\n  Finally, we would continue to allow VA to take reasonable steps to \nminimize its losses when the home loans it guarantees go into default.\n  These provisions, as a group, would allow VA to save $2.799 billion \nover the next 7 years. 2.799 billion bucks simply from extending the \neffect of provisions that have previously been enacted. \n\n[[Page S 17314]]\nThese provisions, I daresay, would not harm veterans.\n  I can say, Mr. President, that no veteran would be harmed by these \nmeasures based on our experience on the Veterans Committee. For what is \nleft unsaid in the context of continuing previously-approved OBRA \nprovisions is as important as what is said. The OBRA provisions that we \nwould extend today are ones which experience has already shown are \nrelatively painless to the Nation's veterans and which have, therefore, \nachieved good bipartisan consensus within the Veterans Committee. They \nare even accepted by the Nations's veterans service organizations--\norganizations that are not always easily pleased, I would remind! \nProvisions in prior Budget Reconciliation Acts that were more \ncontroversial--for example, a provision setting a ceiling on benefits \npaid to an incompetent veteran who has no dependents and whose assets \nexceed $25,000--are not in the package before the Senate today.\n  Second, this package of veterans-related measures would adopt two new \nprovisions that are relatively non-controversial, but which are highly \nsignificant in terms of the savings to be gained.\n  Title X would reimpose a common sense legal standard for compensation \nto VA patients who are injured in VA hospitals. What standard would we \nimpose? The very same standard which applies, insofar as we have been \nable to determine, at every other hospital in America. We would require \nthat a patient show that any harm that was visited upon him or her in a \nVA hospital was the result of VA fault. Recovery would be allowed only \nif that fault could be shown.\n\n  In addition, we would require VA to ``round down'' the compensation \nand survivors' benefits which are adjusted annually to account for \nincreases in the cost of living. What do I mean by this? Traditionally, \nwhen VA recomputed benefits amounts--which are paid in whole dollar \namounts--it rounded up when the recomputed benefit equaled a fractional \ndollar amount of 50 cents or more, and it ``rounded down'' when that \namount was 49 cents or less. The bill before the Senate today would \nrequire that VA ``round down'' in all cases.\n\n                           *   *   *   *   *\n\n  I approved of these provisions--championed by my friend, Senator Jay \nRockefeller, the committee's ranking member--when they were before the \ncommittee. They were then--and they are now--wholly reasonable \nmechanisms for saving almost $1 billion over a 7-year period. Indeed, \nin my view, they are preferable to the alternative measures adopted by \nthe House.\n  But they simply were not acceptable to the chairman of the House \nVeterans' Affairs Committee, Congressman Bob Stump, or to the ranking \nmember of that committee, Congressman G.V. ``Sonny'' Montgomery, for \nwhom the Montgomery GI bill is named. My respect, admiration, and \nregard for Sonny Montgomery--who will retire after the 104th Congress \nand who will be deeply missed by all--impelled me to recommend that the \nSenate conferees recede to the House view on this matter if we could \n``make up the difference'' in other ways. We did.\n  In place of the Montgomery GI bill provisions, the conferees accepted \ntwo House-approved provisions which, collectively, will save almost the \nfull necessary $1 billion. First, we would raise the prescription\n\n                           *   *   *   *   *\n\n  Mr. President, those who hear these comments may infer that I am not \nfully pleased with each and every aspect of the veterans' provisions in \nthis bill. If they infer that, they will be correct. I particularly \nregret the provision relating to survivors' COLAs--though I do not \nthink it is patently unfair. It is regrettable, but not unfair. As we \nall know, however, rarely is a given piece of legislation pleasing in \nall respects.\n  This legislation is, however, almost without precedent in its \nimportance. And it is not--it is not--unfair to the Nation's veterans, \nor to their widows, orphans or families. No--veterans, their widows, \nand their families will benefit, as will all Americans, from deficit \ncontrol--and from the jobs, low interest rates, low inflation, and \nfuture prosperity which hinge on deficit control.\n  We are doing no less today than trying to save this great country as \nwe know it. We veterans fought for that very cause. I know all veterans \nwill join now--as we all did when we were called to arms--in defense of \nthe Nation, and to assure peace, prosperity, and stability for our \nchildren and grandchildren.\n  Mr. President, I appreciate the time I have been afforded to address \nthese critical issues, and I yield back the balance of my time.\n\n\n          VETERANS' RECONCILIATION: MORE THAN THEIR FAIR SHARE\n\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I oppose the provisions of title 10 \nof the conference report--relating to veterans' programs--because they \nare a bad deal for veterans. These provisions were crafted behind \nclosed doors. They must be brought out into the light of day so that \nthe public can understand just how bad they are.\n  First, the overall amount saved is too high. The two Veterans' \nAffairs chairmen accepted, with no action by either body, an increase \nof $300 million over the seven years in the overall savings that the \nVeterans' Affairs Committees generated, from $6.4 billion to $6.7 \nbillion. There is no reason that our Committees should have done this. \nThis increase translates directly into more cuts in veterans' benefits. \nI regret very much that there was a willingness to make veterans do \nmore than their fair share.\n  The provisions provide less than a full cost-of-living adjustment to \ncertain widows of veterans who died in service or later from conditions \nrelated to their service. This diminished COLA is directly contrary to \na promise made by the Congress in 1992 when the survivors benefit \nprogram was revised, and should not be agreed to. I oppose it strongly. \nIt is wrongheaded and mean spirited. There were other ways to find the \nsavings required.\n  The package includes a 100-percent increase in the amount poor \nveterans are charged for a 30-day supply of prescription drugs, raising \nthe amount to $4 from the current $2. Our Committee avoided increasing \nthis copayment. The House Committee had voted a $1 increase, to $3. The \nincrease in the bill is an even greater increase than originally passed \nthe House. It is being included in this package because of the \nChairmen's agreement to accept a higher overall savings target for our \nCommittees than is set forth in the Budget Resolution.\n  The bill expressly repeals the Secretary's existing authority to \nwaive veterans' indebtedness in connection with receiving prescription \ndrugs. Under current law, the Secretary can waive this and other \nindebtedness. However, in an action designed to generate even more \nsavings from poor veterans, the waiver authority as to veterans who \nhave received prescription drugs will be repealed. Frankly, I am not at \nall sure what is intended by this change but if I understand it, the \nonly way to enforce the no-waiver authority will be to refuse to \nprovide prescriptions to veterans who previously received medications \nbut were unable to pay for them. That strikes me as a particularly \nunfortunate change in law and policy.\n  The final compromise includes a provision that would repeal a \nprotection in current law for veterans who are found by VA to owe money \nin connection with a home loan default, even a default that occurs \nyears after the veteran has sold the home to a buyer who then defaults \non the loan, a not uncommon event. Under current law, a veteran who is \nfound by VA to owe money in connection with a loan default is protected \nfrom having his or her income tax offset or federal pay garnished until \nVA gets a court decision affirming the indebtedness. The final \ncompromise will include a House-passed provision that substitutes \nsimple notice to the veteran for this protection.\n  Mr. President, I must note my deep disappointment that the House \nrefused to consider any changes in Montgomery GI bill issues as part of \nour effort to find the mandated savings. The Senate package achieved \nsavings in two ways from the MGIB--by providing for a one-half COLA \nover the seven years and by increasing the contribution that \nservicemembers make who do not opt out of the MGIB. The House's refusal \nto achieve savings from healthy, employed recruits and students, at the \nexpense of widows of veterans who died \n\n[[Page S 17315]]\nfrom service-related causes, and of veterans needing prescription \ndrugs, is simply not acceptable to me. I do not understand their \npriorities.\n  Finally, Mr. President, as I noted at the outset, this compromise was \ncrafted behind closed doors. I was denied any opportunity to \nparticipate in the conference. I asked for a public meeting of the sub-\nconference on a number of occasions in order to give us the opportunity \nto discuss the differences between the House and Senate provisions in a \npublic forum. The only response I received was an invitation to a \nprivate meeting in Senator Simpson's office after the final agreement \nhad been reached. That's just not good enough. The American people \ndeserve better. America's veterans deserve better. We should conduct \nour business in the open, not behind closed doors. This package was \ndeveloped with no input whatsoever from Senate Democrats. That is not \nhow our Committee has functioned in the past. I regret that we are now \ntaking that approach.\n  Mr. President, this package is a bad deal for veterans. It cuts too \ndeeply and in wrong areas. As the Ranking Democrat on the Veterans' \nAffairs Committee, I see my role as looking out for our Nation's \nveterans, as making certain that our promises made to those who gave of \nthemselves in our common defense are kept. This package does not do \nthat. That is why I must oppose it.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/11/17/senate-section/article/S17247-1", "month": "11", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "17", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S17315]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CUT TAXES: BALANCE THE BUDGET\n\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Mr. President, the American people want and deserve an \nend to shameless, wasteful spending programs. They want a reduction in \ntaxes for working middle-class families and a balanced budget so we \nfinally live within our means--as people in my home state of South \nDakota do every day. I feel passionately that we must give the dream of \nAmerica back to our children. That is why I support the Balanced Budget \nAct of 1995.\n  The working men and women in America are fed up with politics as \nusual in Washington. They have spoken loudly that they want us to cut \nwasteful spending, reduce taxes for working middle-class families, and \nfinally balance the budget. The Republicans in Congress have heard this \ncall for change. We, too, are tired of business as usual. That is why \nwe have proposed tax relief for working, middle-class Americans so they \ncan keep more of what they earn, rather than leave it in the hands of \nWashington bureaucrats.\n  Recently, an editorial in the Rapid City Journal praised the current \nRepublican tax plan. This editorial is right on target. Mr. President, \nI ask unanimous consent to place this editorial in the Record at the \nconclusion of my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Why do middle-class, working Americans want us to cut \nspending and provide tax relief? The reason is obvious. The Federal \nGovernment wastes billions of their tax dollars every year on more and \nmore programs that do less and less to meet the needs of average \nAmericans. Working Americans are paying more and more for less and \nless. Now we have the opportunity to cut taxes and in the process make \ngovernment more efficient and effective, smaller and smarter. It is \ntime to give the American people what they want--a balanced budget, an \nend to wasteful spending, and a reduction of taxes for wage-earning, \nmiddle-class working families.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n                       Wide Appeal in Tax Breaks\n\n\nThe tax breaks included in congressional budget proposals will benefit \n                      middle-income Americans most\n\n       In the great budget debate of 1995, congressional Democrats \n     and President Clinton have continually argued that \n     Republicans are targeting the poor and elderly with spending \n     cuts to pay for tax breaks for the wealthy.\n       Hmmm. Tax breaks for the wealthy?\n       There are flaws in this argument.\n       For one thing, the $500-per-child tax credit under the \n     expected budget compromise would go to families with incomes \n     under about $100,000. That means the wealthiest Americans--\n     those with taxable incomes over $100,000--wouldn't qualify \n     for it. And it means most families that pay taxes would pay \n     lower taxes.\n       A second tax break included in both the House and Senate \n     budget bills would reduce the top capital gains tax rate from \n     28 percent to 19.8 percent. Although this tax break would \n     result in wealthy taxpayers paying a lower rate, it could \n     very well mean their total tax bills would be higher. The \n     lower tax rate likely would motivate sales of investment \n     assets that otherwise wouldn't be sold and thus wouldn't \n     generate any tax revenue.\n       Plus, the increased economic activity that a lower capital \n     gains tax rate would generate would result in increased \n     capital for job-creating small businesses and a healthier \n     economy that produces more tax revenue.\n       Besides, a cut in the capital gains tax rate doesn't apply \n     only to wealthy individuals. It applies to everyone who \n     increases their taxable income by selling a home or some \n     other investment. In today's economy, that takes in a lot of \n     people. One study showed that in 1990, when the top capital \n     gains tax rate was lowered from 33 percent to its current 28 \n     percent, 70 percent of the tax returns reporting capital \n     gains were from people with taxable incomes below $75,000.\n       So, while it may be correct that House and Senate budget \n     proposals include some benefit for the wealthy, it's the \n     middle income taxpayers that benefit most.\n       On the other side of the budget's impact on taxpayers are \n     proposed reductions in the Earned Income Tax Credit, a tax \n     break for workers with low incomes. The House bill proposes \n     decreasing planned EITC spending by $23 billion over the next \n     seven years, while the Senate bill proposes $43 billion.\n       Some of this reduction is justified. EITC eligibility \n     requirements need to be tightened so people with low taxable \n     incomes but high nontaxable incomes, from sources such as \n     tax-free annuities, don't qualify. And in a program with a \n     high rate of fraud--the Internal Revenue Service estimates up \n     to 40 percent of the tax returns claiming the EITC contain \n     errors or fraudulent claims--the plan to double penalties for \n     fraudulent EITC claims is justified.\n       But because the EITC program is, in effect, a reward for \n     people who work rather than rely on welfare assistance, the \n     budget proposals should be scaled back so as not to affect \n     the people the EITC is intended to help.\n       Of course, these changes in tax credits and tax rates would \n     increase the complexity of a federal tax code that is already \n     too complicated. We should really be going in the opposite \n     direction, toward a simpler tax code.\n       And on the other side of the budget proposals, the \n     decreases in proposed spending, there is room to argue \n     whether the decreases are targeted fairly.\n       But the tax breaks included in Republican budget proposals \n     aren't as hideous as they've been made out to be.\n       A lot of hard-working, middle-income Americans would \n     benefit.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/11/17/senate-section/article/S17315-1", "month": "11", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "17", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S17315-S17330]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   THE 7-YEAR BALANCED BUDGET RECONCILIATION ACT OF 1995--CONFERENCE \n                                 REPORT\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

On behalf of the majority leader, I ask unanimous \nconsent \n\n[[Page S 17316]]\nthat at 8:15, the Senate proceed to a vote on the motion to waive, \nwithout any further action or debate, and that the time be equally \ndivided between now and 8:15 between the proponents of the point of \norder and the proponents of the waiver.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I yield myself 5 minutes off the time that I \nhave under my control, and will the Chair advise me how much time the \nSenator from Nebraska controls?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska controls 30 minutes.\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, I have been fascinated and horrified by the \npress reports about the horse trading that went on to win the support \nfor the Republican budget. I am not speaking about wooing recalcitrant \nRepublicans who strayed from the party line. No, I am looking at some \nof the sweeteners that were loaded into this bill to keep the medical \nestablishment at bay and to pay the American Medical Association for \ntheir support of the Republican budget.\n  This conference report is groaning with extraneous giveaways to the \nmedical establishment. They do not only violate the Byrd rule, but they \nviolate every sense of decency and fair play. The conference report \nexempts physicians' offices and laboratories from the Clinical \nLaboratory and Improvement Act of 1988.\n  It is clear that this is a violation of the Budget Act. It is \nextraneous, in addition to being bad policy. Antitrust regulations are \nturned on their heads in this conference report just to boost \nphysicians' salaries. The conference report exempts certain groups of \nhealth care providers from the most basic antitrust violations against \nprice fixing. This is also a violation of the Budget Act and is likely \nto impair competition and raise costs for non-Medicare health care \npurchasers.\n  It is appalling that when our seniors, our poor, our disabled, and \nour children are being asked to sacrifice basic health care, the \nRepublicans are trying to enlarge special interest giveaways to the \nNation's physicians.\n  The provisions do not belong in this fast-track reconciliation bill \nand are a violation of the Byrd rule. I urge my colleagues to vote \nagainst the motion to waive this well-founded point of order.\n  Madam President, at this time, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Hutchison). Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. EXON. Madam President, I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. EXON. Madam President, since there are no other Members seeking \nrecognition at this time, I yield 5 minutes of my time to the Senator \nfrom Arkansas.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Madam President, it is not unusual when I go home and \nvisit with some of my wealthy friends--and I do have some wealthy \nfriends--they say, ``The only objection I have to you Democrats is you \nare constantly engaging in class warfare. You are always talking about \nthe wealthy.''\n  I repudiate that idea, but I would like for my colleagues to look at \nthis chart for just a minute. This is a quote from David Gergen--one of \nRonald Reagan's right-hand men when he was President--from an op-ed \npiece that he wrote in this week's U.S. News and World Report. Without \nstraining your eyes, I will tell you what he said about this bill we \nare debating tonight. Eighty percent of the tax breaks in this bill go \nto the wealthiest 20 percent of Americans. Eighty percent of the \nspending cut burden goes to the poorest 20 percent. Now, you talk about \nclass warfare. There is class warfare. It violates every principle I \never learned as a Methodist Sunday school boy. It violates every \nprinciple I have ever held dear, and the very reason I came to the U.S. \nSenate. Madam President, let me say something about the wealthy people \nof this country. They do not like this. Seventy percent of the people \nof this country say they do not want a tax cut until the budget is \nbalanced. Why are we going against what 70 percent of the people say?\n  Last fall, when people were voting, Madam President, most did not \nhave a clue what was in the Contract With America. And I can assure you \nthey were not voting for this. They were not voting to penalize the \npoorest 20 percent of the people in America. They were not in favor of \ndepriving a million children in this country of an education. They were \nnot voting to put another million people in poverty, which this bill \ndoes. They were not voting to cut school lunches, which is the only \ndecent meal an awful lot of children in this country get. They were not \nvoting to savage Medicare and make the elderly people of this country \npay it. They were not voting to savage Medicaid. In my State, Medicaid \nwill be cut 33 percent, Madam President. We will not have a Medicaid \nprogram.\n  The people of America were not voting to slash the Earned Income Tax \nCredit for people who are trying to work and stay off welfare. What are \nwe doing? We are cutting that $32 billion.\n  So I remind my colleagues on the other side of the aisle, when the \nAmerican family gathers around the dinner table in the evening, what do \nthey talk about? What do they say they love? Not the Mercedes in the \ndriveway. Not that posh office downtown or that magnificent farm out \nback. They love their children. That is who they want us to protect. \nWhat are we doing? We are savaging the children of this country. For \nwhat? So that the biggest corporations in America get a break. I yield \nthe floor.\n  Mr. HATCH. Madam President, we are trying to accommodate Members \naround here. And there is no use kidding, I am very upset about this \npoint of order. This is not going to be the last time we mention it \neither. But I want to accommodate everybody around here. We ought to \nhave at least a 2-hour debate on the thing because it is not easy to \nexplain, but it is easy to understand. I have to tell you that I think \neven my colleagues on the other side might understand. But the fact of \nthe matter is that this point of order is wrong. I personally feel very \nbadly about it because what we are doing here is we are allowing the \nrule of reason in some areas and not allowing it in others. It is very \nunfair, it does not work right. We are happy to enhance bureaucracy but \nwe are not happy to enhance individuality. I think we can clarify it \nfor anybody in just a few minutes. But we want to accommodate those who \nwant to get out of here and, frankly, I think we can put a lot of what \nwe have to say into the Record.\n  Let me address this point of order against antitrust rules relating \nto provider-sponsored organizations--PSO's, if you will--and health \ncare groups \n\n[[Page S 17317]]\nthat contract with them to provide Medicare services. These provisions \nwould grant antitrust relief to these two different entities by \nsubjecting their conduct to the rule of reason, rather than the per se \nillegal rule.\n  Let me be clear about what this language would do. This is not an \nantitrust exemption. Under the rule of reason, the conduct of the PSO's \nand their subcontracting health care groups will not be legal if it is \ndesigned to fix prices, divide markets, or exclude competitors. \nInstead, their conduct will be illegal if it is anticompetitive, but if \nit is competitive, leads to efficiency, and produces lower prices for \nhealth care, it will survive antitrust challenge, as it should.\n  This provision that we are about to strike out of here is one of the \nfew that really saves an awful lot of money in health care and flies in \nthe face of bureaucratizing the process, which I thought we defeated \nlast year. We believe that this reform--which is necessary only because \nthe Department of Justice and the Federal Trade Commission have \noverzealously enforced the antitrust laws--is central to the savings we \nanticipate in our Medicare reforms. Right now, because of these \nenforcement policies, groups of doctors cannot form, decide on a fee \nschedule, and negotiate with anyone over providing health care \nservices, if this is knocked out. This knocks out of the market a \npotentially new class of competitors with low overhead and little or no \nbureaucracy, who can make these other groups bring prices down.\n  The Congressional Budget Office scored the savings to be generated by \nthe House and Senate Medicare reform bills at between $34.2 billion and \n$50.4 billion over 7 years.\n  CBO did not break out how much of this savings was attributable to \nthe creation of health care provider groups that could contract with \nPSO's, and the importance of the antitrust reform needed to encourage \nthe groups to form. The CBO noted the creation of PSO's in these groups \nwould have an impact on Medicare outlays and that is all that is needed \nto meet the express language of the Byrd rule.\n  Further, since this bill is creating two whole new classes of \ncompetitors in the Medicare market, and the antitrust provisions are \ncritical to encouraging their formation, it is clear that these \nprovisions are critical to producing the billions of dollars in savings \nwe are counting on for innovation and competition. I do not think that \nanyone can seriously contend that these provisions have no budgetary \nimpact.\n  The second argument that one might raise against these provisions is \nthat they are somehow incidental to reconciliation. This aspect of the \nByrd rule is designed to prevent the addition of provisions that have \nnothing to do with the budget. The antitrust provisions clearly satisfy \nthe Byrd rule. The rule has nothing to do with the larger changes in \nall antitrust law.\n  In fact, it does not change antitrust law at all, only the \nadministration's enforcement. More importantly, the antitrust \nprovisions are expressly limited only to conduct that is necessary to \nprovide health care services under Medicare contract or plan. It has no \napplication outside of the Medicare context, and any attempt to use \ninformation gained in Medicare context beyond the limits of that \nprogram--what some people call a leakage or seepage problem--would be \nillegal. Any conduct occurring in the Medicare context that is just a \nsham for price fixing or boycotting would still be illegal under the \nrule of reason.\n  I suggest that those who would use the Byrd rule to stop these \nprovisions are not concerned, Madam President, about budgetary impact \nor incidental provisions. Instead, they are interested in suppressing \ncompetition in the health care market and reducing Medicare costs.\n  We should be frank. The status quo helps large hospitals and \ninsurance companies and HMO's. These antitrust provisions that are in \nthis bill that they are trying to rule out of order may cut down on \ntheir profit margins by introducing whole new classes of health care \nproviders into the marketplace. New market actors will spur competition \nefficiency and lower costs.\n  When we are fighting to find ways to reduce Government costs and the \nGovernment's tax burden, why turn away an attractive mechanism to make \nthe markets work better and to reduce the budget?\n\n  The fact is per se illegal activity will still be illegal. These \nentities would have to live within the rule of reason. If they do not \nand they do not increase competition, increase efficiency, and reduce \ncosts, then they are not going to be able to function, and they should \nnot be.\n  The fact of the matter is that this point of order is wrong, and I \nhope that we will vote to waive the point of order.\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, I yield 3 minutes to the Senator from \nFlorida.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Thank you, Madam President.\n  As I read the front cover of the document which has just been \npresented to us, Balanced Budget Act of 1995, Part 1 of 2--Part 2 \napparently has not yet arrived--the question arises, why will I vote \nagainst this proposition?\n  It is not, Madam President, because I am opposed to a balanced \nbudget. I am, in fact, strongly supportive of a balanced budget, and \nevery occasion I have had an opportunity to advance that cause I have \ndone so.\n  I frankly commend the Republicans for having presented us an \nalternative which purports to achieve that goal of balanced budget \nbecause it will provide a significant point of debate and dialog as to \nhow to achieve that goal.\n  However, Madam President, I do not feel that this legislation \npresented tonight will accomplish the objective of balanced budget for \ntwo primary reasons. One, just as in foreign policy, I do not believe \nthis Nation can achieve an important long-term domestic policy goal \nunless that goal is broadly shared, unless there is bipartisan support.\n  The fact is, there is no bipartisan support for this provision. There \nhas been no attempt to secure bipartisan support. No Democrats were \nsanctioned into the conferences which led to the production of this \nlegislation. No Democratic ideas were solicited for inclusion.\n  Second, this will not achieve the goal of a balanced budget over the \nnext 7 years because it is fundamentally unfair and will soon be seen \nto be unfair by the American people and rejected.\n  I am going to concentrate my comments on fairness on only one section \nof this multihundred-page bill, Part 1 of 2, goes to 966 pages. That is \nthe sections that relate to Medicaid.\n  First, the statement is made that this legislation reduces Medicaid \nspending by $163 billion over the next 7 years. Madam President, that \nis not true. In fact, this legislation reduces Medicaid spending by \nalmost $400 billion over the next 7 years.\n  What is the difference? The difference is because this legislation \nremoves virtually all of the current requirements on States to make a \nsignificant contribution towards the health of their poor, their \ndisabled and their frail elderly.\n  Second, this allows for future manipulation of the Medicaid Program. \nWe worked hard in this Senate to eliminate the abuses that had become \nso rampant in the disproportionate share hospital program. This \nlegislation allows all those abuses to return. This legislation, in \nfact, rewards those very States that have been the principal abusers of \nthe disproportionate share program.\n  Madam President, for those and many other reasons that we will find \nin these 966 pages, this proposal fails to meet the duel test of \nbipartisanship and fairness necessary for its sustained achievement of \nthe goal of the balanced budget.\n  Madam President, we are here debating a bill that nobody has \nreceived. Even for those who may have a copy, it would be impossible \nfor them to have possibly read the legislation from cover to cover.\n  And yet, this is one of the most significant bills to come before the \nCongress. This is a bill that makes up to $1 trillion in reductions to \nour Nation's budget--including $256 billion in Medicare reductions and \n$163.5 billion in Medicaid reductions--over the next 7 years.\n  I rise today to speak to the best of my knowledge about some of the \nprovisions in this bill. Of course, the ``best of my knowledge'' is \nlimited by the amount of information we have managed to obtain, some of \nwhich our office has had to get from lobbyists who always seem to get \nsuch materials before the rest of the Congress.\n\n[[Page S 17318]]\n\n  Due to time limitations, I will focus on the massive reductions or \n$420 billion in Federal cuts that will be made in this bill to our \nNation's Medicare and Medicaid programs which are integral parts of our \nNation's health infrastructure.\n\n\n       medicaid cuts even higher due to state-federal combination\n\n  The first point that has been neglected about this budget deal are \nthat the real Medicaid reductions are more in the neighborhood of $400 \nbillion over the next 7 years. Part of this figure comes from the \n$163.5 billion in Federal reductions to Medicaid. However, an often \noverlooked but just as significant provision is the language in the \nbill that guts the matching rate requirements of States.\n  This reduction will have the effect of reducing another $200-plus \nbillion in State funding over the next 7 years to the Medicaid program.\n  How does this work? At present, States such as New York have to match \na Federal Medicaid dollar with a State Medicaid dollar. No longer. \nAccording to the revised State matching requirements, New York would be \nallowed to match a Federal Medicaid dollar with just 67 cents--a 33-\npercent reduction.\n  The effect of the change to the matching rates across the Nation will \nbe a $200-plus billion reduction in State funding to Medicaid.\n  Moreover, the conference agreement eliminates two provisions in the \nSenate bill that were agreed to unanimously in the Senate Finance \nCommittee. These amendments would have continued to prohibit the gaming \nof the Medicaid System through the use of provider taxes and prohibited \nStates from supplanting current State health expenditures with Medicaid \ndollars.\n  The conference committee agreement encourages States to go back to \nthe days of fictitious accounting and gaming that in the past \neffectively raided the Medicaid Program.\n  The effect of this policy under a block grant is not to raid the \nFederal treasury but to make the State matching rate illusory at best. \nIn fact, the conference report effectively makes Medicaid a general \nrevenue sharing program.\n  It is no wonder that some of our Nation's Governors are clamoring and \ncheerleading the destruction of the Medicaid Program. I have a warning \nfor them, or more accurately, a proverb for them. The proverb goes as \nfollows: ``Fish see the worm not the hook.''\n  The Governors who are anxious to gobble up these block grants and \nillusory matching rates will feel took in the future when their \neconomies stumble, when an epidemic strikes, when a nature disaster \nhits, when inflation creeps up again, or when their populations grow.\n\n\n                  Nation's Low-Income Elderly At Risk\n\n  Another often misunderstood provision of this legislation is the \nimpact that it will have on our Nation's low-income elderly.\n  Let me emphasize that the Republican bill repeals the current law \nguarantee of payment of the Medicare Part B premiums on behalf of \nelderly Americans with income below the poverty level--$622 per month \nfor an individual.\n  Although the Speaker of the House claims the bill ``provides that \nsenior citizens at the poverty level and below have all of their Part B \npremium paid for by the taxpayers--100 percent,'' the fact is that, no \npoor senior citizen has a guarantee to any coverage or assistance \nwhatsoever.\n  States would be asked to set aside a certain percentage of their \nprogram spending each year to pay for Medicare premiums, deductibles, \nand coinsurance on behalf of low-income elderly. However, this set-\naside will be sufficient to cover only about 44 percent of the costs of \nPart B premiums for those now eligible by the year 2002.\n\n\n                  Nursing Home--Liens of Family Homes\n\n  Another provision that was unanimously agreed to in the Senate \nFinance Committee was a provision that protected spouses having liens \nplaced against their home or family farm. Incredibly, this provision \nwas also dropped by the conference committee.\n  As a result, the conference agreement repeals current law protections \nagainst the use of liens and expressly authorizes States to impose \nliens on the home or family farm of a beneficiary, even when the spouse \nis still living in it.\n\n\n                unfairness of medicaid cuts and formula\n\n  Finally, I want to raise some policy questions that the bill creates. \nFirst what is the policy justification for $163.5 billion in Medicaid \nreductions? This provides for just a 1.9 percent increase in Medicaid \nspending per person over the seven year period and is far less than the \n7.1 percent the Congressional Budget Office projects private sector \nspending to increase.\n  Second, what is the policy justification for arriving at the Medicaid \nformula in the bill? Can anybody possibly explain how the fiscal year \n1996 State-by-State allocations are arrived at? Dollar figures are \nstated in law. How were those numbers arrived at?\n  Clearly, one impact is to reward those States that have extremely \nhigh share of disproportionate share in the past. Some of those States \nabused the Medicaid Program and will be rewarded for that abuse in the \nnew Medicaid formula.\n  At one point, the Senate Finance Committee staff had proposed that \nStates with excessive disproportionate share payments would lose those \nexcess payments. The Senate Finance Committee voted to cap those \npayments at 12 percent.\n  That provision was deleted, and instead, States are now rewarded for \ntheir excesses and--in some cases--their abuse.\n  These States will have those funds permanently cemented in their base \nallocation and allowed to increase them well into the future. What is \nthe policy rationale for this?\n  Whatever the rationale, the effect is to apportion funding in a \nmanner that is fundamentally unfair to those States that did not scam \nthe Medicaid disproportionate share program, those States that are \ngrowing and those States that have been efficient in the past.\n  In Florida's case, we have a larger population than either \nPennsylvania and Ohio and an elderly population that is 40.7 percent \ngreater than Pennsylvania and 79.2 percent greater than Ohio, yet will \nreceive less money over the next 7 years from Medicaid than either of \nthose two States.\n  Florida has 5.4 percent of the Nation's population, 8 percent of the \nNation's elderly population but will receive just 4.2 percent of the \noverall Federal Medicaid allocation between fiscal year 1996 and 2002.\n  If Florida were to just receive its population share of money, it \nwould receive $42.7 billion instead of the $33.0 billion allowed in \nthis bill, a $9.7 billion disparity or loss to Florida over the 7-year \nperiod.\n\n\n                             other problems\n\n  For all these reasons and for numerous others--such as the conference \ncommittee's level of Medicare cuts on our Nation's elderly and the \ndanger and exposure that Medicare beneficiaries will be subjected to \ndue to watered down emergency care managed care standards, I cannot and \nwill not support this legislation.\n  I would like to turn the Senate's attention from Medicaid and \nMedicare for a moment to another important issue before the Senate \ntonight.\n  Madam President, when the Senate votes on the reconciliation bill \nshortly, there will be one important issue which risks being lost in \nthe enormity of the Medicare cutting, Medicaid gutting, tax cutting, \nand budget balancing package.\n  That issue is welfare reform.\n  The effrontery of burying such a monumentally important matter in the \nmiddle of a massive Medicare, Medicaid, Tax Code, and budget overhaul \nspeaks for itself.\n  The welfare reform component of this reconciliation bill deserves \nstrict scrutiny instead of token consideration.\n  My support for sweeping change in our Nation's welfare system is a \nmatter of record, and as recently as September 19, 1995, I joined with \n86 of my colleagues in supporting the Work Opportunity Act of 1995, \nSenate bill 1120.\n  I voted in support of this bill, even though I had serious \nreservations, in order to keep the welfare reform effort in this \nCongress alive.\n  Unfortunately, the conference agreement moves welfare reform in the \nopposite direction. The pending legislation is worse than what we had \nto consider 2 months ago.\n  Madam President, I support welfare reform. I want to see Congress \npass a welfare reform measure, and I want to \n\n[[Page S 17319]]\nsee the President sign welfare reform legislation. But this bill \ndeserves neither.\n  Welfare reform, when it is done well, works and works well.\n  Florida boasts of two very successful welfare pilot projects, the \nlargest in America in instituting a ``time limited benefit.'' Florida, \nin fact, has been one of the pioneers in the ``two years and you are \nout'' approach that is mirrored in the pending legislation.\n  But, Madam President, these pilots are succeeding because there is a \nfront-end investment in the lives of those affected by the program \nchange.\n  Whether it is day care, job training, temporary transportation \nassistance, or health care, the welfare recipient is given a hand up \ninstead of a hand out.\n  I visited the program in Pensacola, FL. Earlier this year President \nClinton met some of the participants that I met, and he touted the \nprogram.\n  Madam President, the conference agreement before the Senate, as it \npertains to welfare reform, is a mixture of good news and bad news.\n  The good news is that the conference agreement no longer treat \neducation as welfare. We have Congressman Clay Shaw and others to thank \nfor that improvement.\n  Thankfully, the welfare reform legislation no longer kicks legal \nimmigrants who pay taxes and are eligible for Federal student loans or \ngrants, out of school.\n  This change assures 21,000 students in universities, colleges, and \ncommunity colleges in Florida that they can continue to study and train \nin order to provide for their families and enhance our Nation's \nproductivity.\n  Further, the conference agreement renounces the previous position of \nthe Senate where deeming would occur past the date of citizenship. That \nprovision appeared unconstitutional on its face, and fortunately, it \nwas dropped.\n  But, Madam President, I am sorry to report that there is an \noverwhelming amount of bad news emerging from the conference on welfare \nreform.\n  First, the formula to allocate funds to the States continues welfare \nas we knew it. It treats poor children differently, depending upon \nwhich State they live in.\n\n  The conference formula says that if your State spent a lot in the old \ndays, and thus built incentives to keep people on welfare, you will be \ngiven a leg up on every other State under block grants.\n  That is how it is possible, for example, that the State of Michigan \nwould be given $217 million more, each year, than the State of Florida, \nwhich has a population that is 4.5 million greater than Michigan's \npopulation.\n  The conclusion is simple: the formula adopted by the conferees is \nflawed, if not rigged.\n  The conferees had an option: adopt a fair share allocation which \ntreats children the same regardless of their ZIP codes. I offered such \nan amendment 2 months ago.\n  Instead, the conferees chose to reward the big spenders who got us in \nthis mess in the first place.\n  If parents rewarded bad behavior of their children like this, we \nwould be a nation of reform schools.\n  Madam President, another glaring disappointment in the conference \nagreement before the Senate is the retreat on a commitment to funding \nchild care.\n  The Senate voted for a $3 billion increase over 5 years and now we \nsee that the conference agreement proposes $3 billion over 7 years.\n  That may sound like an innocuous accounting change until you look at \nthe impact on the States.\n  That change means for Florida less child care money next year, I \nrepeat, less money next year, than it had this year.\n  Keep in mind that Florida is expected to more than double in one year \nits population of welfare recipients in the work force.\n  The conference agreement short-changes Florida $18 million in child \ncare funds from the amount that passed the Senate in September. That is \nmovement backward, not forward.\n  When you take the faulty funding formula for the block grants, and \ncombine them with the paltry child care allocations, you get the \ngrowing sense that Florida has been set up to fail.\n  Madam President, it did not have to be this way. If government were \nrun like a business, you would have had by now a debate about a \nbusiness plan.\n  In effect, you would have identified outcomes to be achieved, and \nthen identified the means necessary to achieve those outcomes.\n  Just in the area of child care alone, in order to meet the job \nrequirements of the conference agreement for the first 5 years after \nenactment, Florida would need approximately $800 million in child care \nfunding. The conference agreement gives Florida $509 million.\n  That $291 million shortfall means that tens of thousands of children \ncan not get child care, and therefore, their mothers or fathers can't \ngo to work.\n  But the Congress wasn't interested in outcome and resource analysis. \nThe Congress didn't want to do a business plan.\n  The Congress wanted to cut tens of billions of dollars out of welfare \nand shift those burdens to the States.\n  I will highlight a few more disappointments.\n  The Senate placed $878 million in a growth fund to assist States \nwhich experience caseload increases, and thus, cost increases. The \nconference agreement reduces that about 10 percent.\n  I mentioned earlier that there was good news in the conference \nagreement as it pertains to legal immigrants and access to Federal \nassistance to higher educational programs.\n  But even that good news has a new catch. The conferees have set up a \nnew class system now in the Stafford loans program. Now legal immigrant \napplicants must have a sponsor or other citizen cosign the loans.\n\n  No debate on this change. No hearings. A brand new provision written \nin conference.\n  So I am left to believe that the conferees felt that only the better \noff of the legal immigrant communities are eligible for a Federal loan \nprogram, even though they all pay taxes like citizens pay taxes. So \nmuch for the American dream.\n  The city of Miami had more legal immigrants admitted last year than \n20 States combined did. Thus the prohibitions and timetables on certain \nbenefits will shift to Miami costs that once were shared or born by the \nFederal Government.\n  The State of Florida does not set immigration policy. The State of \nFlorida did not negotiate a 20,000 legal immigrants per year agreement \nbetween Cuba and the United States.\n  But the State of Florida is now being told the following: first, we \nare going to cheat you on the block grant, and give States like New \nYork more than four times what you get.\n  Second, we are going to cut child care for your State, and leave you \n$300 million below what you need to achieve the work participation \nrates that we intend to grade you on.\n  Finally, we are going to stick you with hundreds of millions of \ndollars in costs for legal and illegal immigration, even though you \nhave no control over those policies.\n  How is that for fairness? How is that for reasonableness?\n  Madam President, I am disappointed with the direction the welfare \nreform measure went after it left the Senate. It has taken a turn for \nthe worse. For the State of Florida, a State which did not have a high \nwelfare benefit check and thus did not contribute as greatly to the \nwelfare culture as those States who now reap windfalls for having \ncreated the problem, the conference agreement is not acceptable.\n  I urge the President to veto this bill and for both sides to begin to \nwork together immediately toward reaching a consensus plan on balancing \nthe Nation's budget. There is another way.\n  Mr. KYL. Madam President, let me get back to the issue before us, \nwhich is the objection to the point of order that has been made to \ncertain provisions of this bill.\n  Madam President, we ought not to waive this provision. We should not \nhave to waive the provision because there is nothing violative of the \nByrd rule in the antitrust provisions of the Medicare part of the \nBalanced Budget Act of 1995.\n  Let me go back a little bit to set the stage here. The whole theory \nof our Medicare reform, how we are beginning to strengthen Medicare and \nsave it from bankruptcy, is to create more choices in the marketplace \nso that competition will drive costs down while also ensuring quality \nof care.\n  Now, in order to create those choices, we allowed for the creation of \na couple \n\n[[Page S 17320]]\nof new products in this legislation. One of the products is the medical \nsavings account whereby people would have an incentive not to spend all \nof the deductible amount that they did not have to spend, and we \nprovided that tax free.\n  As a result of a Byrd problem on that provision, the inside buildup--\nthat is to say, the part that you do not spend--is now going to be \ntaxed.\n  One of the products is not going to be nearly as attractive as it was \nwhen we wrote our bill.\n  The other new product is the hospital and physician organization, a \nnew type of entity, somewhat similar to an HMO, but not really the same \nbecause here instead of having an insurance company or some kind of \nadministrative organization that runs the whole program you simply have \nphysicians and hospitals in a community getting together to offer their \nservices on a capitated basis for the people who would be eligible for \nMedicare benefits.\n  It is believed the creation of these organizations by cutting out the \nmiddleman and creating a new product would, in fact, create that kind \nof choice and therefore the competition in the marketplace would cause \ncosts to be reduced.\n  The two products, together, along with existing Medicare and the HMO \noption that currently exists would therefore create lower costs, thus \nallowing us to save the $270 billion over the 7 years that is needed in \norder to prevent the bankruptcy of the system.\n  Madam President, as I said, the medical savings account part of this \nis now jeopardized because of the Byrd rule. If we also cripple the \nphysician-hospital organizations because of the Byrd rule, we will have \nlargely failed to create the two new products and therefore the \ncompetition, the choice, and the competition in this, and I fear, Madam \nPresident, that our entire Medicare reform will fail. And the \ncommitment that we have made to our seniors, as a result of the \nDemocrats raising the objection here, will cause our Medicare reform to \nfail.\n\n  Madam President, I will say this as clearly as I can. If and when \nthat happens, the American people, and in particular the seniors of \nthis country, ought to know precisely where the blame lies. Because we \nhave an opportunity this evening to save the Medicare system. But if \npeople do not vote down this point of order, it is in serious jeopardy \nof going bankrupt because our system will not have within it the two \nkey products that would be created to create this competition and \nchoice.\n  What exactly happens here? Why are we so concerned about this? For \nthe doctors and the hospitals to get together to create this kind of \norganization, they have to talk to each other and they have to talk \nabout prices and how they are going to treat patients. When that \nhappens, lawyers are going to say, you are violating the antitrust \nlaws. Under a per se rule, which means ``in and of itself,'' that would \nbe true. The mere fact that you sit down and talk about it violates the \nlaw.\n  So we have said in here, let us substitute the rule of reason, a rule \nof antitrust law that says we will consider it under the circumstances. \nIf what they did is really wrong and violative of the antitrust laws, \nthen we are still going to prosecute them. But if, under the \ncircumstances of creating this new product, and only for the purpose of \ncontracting with Medicare, they get together and talk about these \nthings, things such as prices, then it would be OK. But the Justice \nDepartment, FTC, still would look at this under a rule of reason, as \nSenator Hatch pointed out.\n  There are two main points, and this is what I will close on. The CBO \nallegedly has not scored this--excuse me, has said it would have no \nbudgetary effect. That is not true. The CBO has never said that, so \nthat basis for a parliamentary ruling would simply be in error. Quite \nthe opposite is true with respect to the physician-hospital networks.\n  Second, the conclusion is that the antitrust provisions are merely \nincidental. In this regard, two contradictory arguments are made. One, \nthat this is such a big deal that all kinds of doctors are going to get \ntogether and fix prices and it is going to affect the market far beyond \nthe Medicare market. The other is that it is merely incidental.\n  Both cannot be true. The fact of the matter is, the antitrust \nprovisions are critical to the creation of this product. It is going to \nbe very hard for them to work without the antitrust exemption. So it is \nnot merely incidental. It is there for the sole purpose of enabling \nthese organizations to operate.\n  If they cannot operate, then the cost savings are not there because \nthey cannot compete in the marketplace, and our system is destined to \nfail. It is only for Medicare contracts.\n  Madam President, I will conclude it this way. If this provision comes \nout, if these antitrust modifications, just to the rule of reason, come \nout of the bill, then I am going to predict that this could easily \nfail. If it does, the people who vote against this this evening are the \nones who should be held responsible.\n  I hope that Democrats and Republicans alike will join us in defeating \nthis objection and in sustaining the waiver to the budget point of \norder.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I rise to support Senator Exxon's Point \nof Order that the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments [CLIA] \nrepealed in this budget reconciliation bill violates the Byrd Rule.\n  The Senate Parliamentarian has ruled that repealing CLIA violates the \nByrd Rule because it produces changes or outlays that are merely \nincidental to the nonbudgetary components of the provision. That is a \nviolation of the Byrd Rule.\n  Let me explain briefly to my colleagues what CLIA is, and why it is \nso important to me and to millions of Americans.\n  CLIA `88 set for the first time uniform quality standards for all \nclinical labs. I am proud that this law, which I authored, was passed \nwith broad bipartisan support.\n  CLIA was passed in 1988 and implemented in 1992 to address serious \nand life-threatening conditions in clinical labs.\n  To now even suggest we turn back the clock to pre-1988 will have \ndevastating results. Do we really want to:\n  Turn back to a time when tests were misread and diseases \nmisdiagnosed.\n  Turn back to the bad old days of misdiagnosis of the HIV/AIDS virus.\n  When doctors were using inferior methods of reading slides.\n  When people with the virus went undetected because the virus was \nmutating and was recognized by physicians.\n  Or turn back to a time when the lab technicians were overworked and \nundersupervised.\n  When slides were taken home.\n  When dirty labs were tolerated.\n  When lab technicians had little or no formal training, resulting in \nmany diseases going undetected.\n  My colleagues, CLIA works, CLIA saves lives. Reconciliation is not \nthe place to make such changes. I urge you to sustain this point of \norder.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, we are being asked to vote on the antitrust \nprovisions of this conference report. As I understand it, these \nprovisions would allow doctors to form Medicare provider networks--\nsimilar to existing managed care networks that are run by insurance \ncompanies--without running afoul of the per se standards of anti-trust \nlaw.\n  This provision violates the Byrd law. It is extraneous. It has no \neffect on the deficit, and therefore it does not belong in the budget \nreconciliation bill.\n  Furthermore, Madam President, this issue has just now been brought \nbefore the Senate. There was no similar provision in the Senate version \nof the reconciliation bill. There have not been hearings before the \nJudiciary Committee. And, we have not had a chance to examine the \neffects of this change in anti-trust law.\n  But, let me say that as ranking member of the Judiciary Committee, I \nwould be happy to give this matter full consideration. We should find \nout whether the change proposed here would really create more \ncompetition in the health care sector of the economy--and we should \nexamine whether this would be a benefit to rural areas of the country.\n  And, frankly, in this new health care climate, with the emphasis on \nbig insurance companies running managed care plans like HMO's, doctors \nneed some protection. I have told physicians in Delaware that I am \nwilling to help find ways to ensure that doctors can be doctors. I \nthink that if doctors ran the managed care networks, we might all be \nbetter off. If that means that we \n\n[[Page S 17321]]\nmust provide anti-trust relief, then I am willing to look closely at \nit.\n  But, I cannot support doing it here--doing it now--on a bill that is \nsupposed to reduce the deficit. Therefore, I will support stripping \nthis provision from the bill, and I will vote against the motion to \nwaive the rules for physician anti-trust relief.\n  I hope, however, that we will look at this more closely, in a more \nrational way, on another day.\n  Mr. EXON. I yield 8 minutes to the Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, the argument we have heard, \nunfortunately, is somewhat like the trial in ``Alice in Wonderland.'' \nFirst you have the sentence and then you have the trial afterward. In \nthis case--and this shows the very reason for the Byrd rule--we have \nspecial antitrust rules that are embedded in the reconciliation bill on \nbehalf of the doctors' lobby. They are significant matters. They \npropose changes in antitrust law, in the policy that competition \nprovides the best protection for consumers. I have said when you have \nthe sentence first and you have the trial after: You would think that \nif you were going to make these major antitrust rules changes--I do not \nknow, Madam President, if I am disturbing this conversation in front of \nme or not.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. LEAHY. It is a fascinating conversation, and I will probably \npause long enough to listen to it myself.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If the Senators will come to order, so we can \nhear the Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. As I was saying, we are being required to make these major \nantitrust changes without any proceedings, hearings or debate. We are \nbeing required to do it without any vote. All we hear from is, \napparently, the back room somewhere. Here some highly-paid lobby comes \nin and says, ``Whisper, whisper, whisper,'' and what comes out of that? \nWe end up with a special provision in a budget reconciliation bill. We \nhave a reconciliation bill and tucked in there are major changes in the \nantitrust law.\n  Mr. KYL. Will the Senator yield a moment?\n  Mr. LEAHY. I tried not to interrupt the Senator from Arizona before. \nLet me finish, and then I will be happy to yield for a question.\n  Mr. KYL. Thank you.\n  Mr. LEAHY. The Senate budget reconciliation bill that the Senate \npassed contained no such provision of which I am aware. The House \noriginally had two. Then they end up with one. An unnecessary and \ndangerous antitrust law change is in the conference report on budget \nreconciliation.\n  Again, I do not know where it came from. It did not come from \nhearings or debate, and it certainly did not come from any votes on the \nSenate floor. I am not aware that it came from any votes on the House \nfloor.\n  Yet in proposed new subsection (f), of proposed new section 1853 to \nthe Social Security Act, as contained in section 8001 of title 8 of the \nBudget Reconciliation Conference Report, in a special antitrust rule \nand change in our antitrust policy.\n  What it does is this: It exempts certain groups of doctors and other \nhealth care providers from the so-called per se rule against price \nfixing in our antitrust laws.\n  The conference report does omit the heading ``Special Antitrust Rule \nFor Provider Service Networks''--originally the House-passed bill \nactually had a heading and flagged the change --they took the heading \nout, but they left a rewrite of the section in. Maybe because this \nreconciliation bill is so long and filled with so many special interest \ngimmicks and gimmies and giveaways, maybe they thought that if you take \nthe headings off, people will not know they are there. But it is still \nthere as a subsection.\n  It attempts to enact a special antitrust rule for groups of health \ncare providers. It provides that the conduct of members of a group of \nhealth care providers, such as doctors, in ``negotiating, making, and \nperforming a contract--including the establishment and modification of \nfee schedule--'' with a provider-sponsored organization for services \nunder a MedicarePlus plan cannot be subject to the per se rule against \nprice fixing.\n  Basically, it says, go ahead and agree on whatever you want because \nwe will make it harder for anyone to prove that you are violating the \nantitrust laws. You are on your own.\n  Instead of the per se rule that is usually applied to stop price \nfixing, the only antitrust rule that can be applied is to consider and \ntest the conduct based on its ``reasonableness, taking into account all \nrelevant factors affecting competition, in properly defined markets''.\n  This is changing one of the most basic rules of antitrust law, \nchanging it in a little special gimmie or giveaway provision, tucked in \nthe reconciliation bill for whatever special interest wrote it. It \nchanges the rule from the one that applies to competitors throughout \nthe rest of the economy and that works to protect competition and \nconsumers.\n  The antitrust law treats a very limited category of conduct as per se \nunlawful. That is reserved for naked restraints, that is, those that \nare inherently harmful to competition without conferring offsetting \nbenefits. The classic example, Madam President, I say to my colleagues, \nis an agreement among competitors to fix the price of the products or \nservices they sell when the agreement is not reasonably necessary to \nthe operation of an efficiency-enhancing joint venture.\n  In fact, seeing my friend from Arizona on the floor, I would refer to \nthe Supreme Court decision Arizona v. Maricopa County Medical Society, \n457 U.S. 332 (1982). In that case, the Supreme Court held that a group \nof competing doctors who agreed on the maximum price at which they \nwould sell their services to insurers without substantially \nintegrating, that is, without becoming partners or joint venturers that \nshare financial risk, was engaged in per se illegal price fixing.\n  Madam President, I am advised the leadership would like to make an \nunanimous consent request, and I yield for that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n\n\n                      Unanimous-Consent Agreement\n\n  Mr. KYL. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator \nDomenici have 30 seconds to close, and the Senate then proceed to vote \non the motion to waive without further action or debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. LEAHY. Reserving the right to object, 30 seconds to close after I \nfinish or right now?\n  Mr. KYL. Right now.\n  I am sorry----\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I understand Senator Leahy was going to complete his \nspeech and then that would take place.\n  Mr. KYL. At the conclusion of his remarks.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Instead of giving the full amount, I will take about \nanother half minute, and then I have no objection. I enjoy hearing----\n  Mr. KYL. I amend the unanimous consent request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If the Senator from Arizona would finish his \nrequest?\n  Mr. KYL. The request is that at the conclusion of Senator Leahy's \nremarks, Senator Domenici have 30 seconds to close and we then proceed \nwithout any further debate to a vote on the motion to waive.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Madam President, I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, I understand Members may be trying to \nrestate the question by the Senator from Arizona. I will assure the \nSenator from Arizona and the Democratic leader that when they are \ngetting close to that I will yield immediately for them to make the \nrequest again.\n  Basically the point is a very serious point. I do not want to make \nmotions on this or other reconciliation bills. I do so only \nreluctantly. But this is such a major change in the antitrust law to be \ntucked in here absent hearings, absent debate, and absent votes. I \nthink is wrong.\n  For those Members of the Senate who are here, when we talked about \nthe Byrd rule in the first place, it was specifically for this. We are \ntalking about a reconciliation bill that goes past the normal debate \nrules of the Senate. I see the distinguished senior Senator from West \nVirginia on the floor. I think he would be the first to agree regarding \nthis reconciliation. \n\n[[Page S 17322]]\n\n  The budget reconciliation conference report would cast aside the per \nse rule, and override the Maricopa decision for provider groups and \nprovider-sponsored organizations or PSOs. Members of provider groups, \nsuch as doctors, would not be required to share financial risk in order \nto avoid per se treatment when they collectively set fees at which they \nprovide services. Instead, these loose-knit groups would merely have to \nmeet a checklist of criteria to qualify for the special treatment.\n  None of the group requirements is a substitute for the antitrust \nlaw's requirement of meaningful, shared risk. Under the language of the \nconference report the members need only be part of a group that ``is \nfunded in part by capital contributions made by the members.'' This is \nno substitute for the shared risk required of a joint venture under \nantitrust law.\n  Nor would members of PSOs be required to share financial risk under \ncurrently governing law in order to avoid per se treatment under \ntraditional analysis. Instead, they are provided their own special \nantitrust rule in subsection (e) by which ``affiliated'' providers need \nshare, ``directly or indirectly,'' barely a majority financial interest \nin the PSO. So long as the providers, who would otherwise be \ncompetitors, meet the indirect affiliation provisions of the bill, they \nwill be allowed to exchange information ``relating to costs, sales, \nprofitability, marketing, prices, or fees for any health care product \nor service.''\n  These provisions each require the antitrust enforcement agencies to \nconduct a resource-intensive analysis of the ``properly defined \nmarket'' in order to challenge conduct that normally would be swiftly \ncondemned as price fixing. Given limited enforcement resources, this \nchange in law inevitably would mean that some anticompetitive \nactivities will go unprosecuted. Could it be that this explains the \ndoctors' lobby's insistence on inclusion of this provision in the \nconference report?\n  The provisions regarding the provider groups admittedly have to \nrevenue or savings effect for deficit reduction purposes. The \nprovisions regarding the PSOs did not have a score until, miraculously, \njust before this debate was about to being.\n  Neither set of special rules is integral to Medicare reform. Although \ndefended as a means to encourage provider-sponsored health plans as an \nalternative to insurers, no such special antitrust treatment is needed \nto promote Medicare reform.\n  Provider networks already exist without any special antitrust rule. \nAccording to industry statistics, 20 percent of all PPOs and 15 percent \nof all HMOs are provider-owned. A survey by Modern Healthcare showed \nthat in 1994, without a special antitrust rule, over 9 million people \nwere enrolled in provider-owned PPOs. In addition, many other provider-\nsponsored managed care plans are being developed or planned without the \nenactment of a special antitrust rule. The Physician Payment Review \nCommission concluded in its 1995 Report to Congress that the available \ninformation did not indicate a significant problem of antitrust laws \nimpeding the development of provider-sponsored managed care plans. The \nPPRC Report noted press accounts indicating that many physician-\nsponsored networks are in the process or formation and that ``three-\nfourths of state medical societies are either contemplating or are \nactually in the process of establishing physician-sponsored networks.''\n  Finally, in the past 2 years the Federal Trade Commission and the \nDepartment of Justice have issued literally dozens of staff advisory \nopinions approving the proposed development of provider-sponsored \nnetworks.\n  The Senate bill contains no such provisions. In debate on our bill, \nSenator Frist expressly noted the absence of a Senate provision like \nproposed section 1853(f). Senator Hatch spoke to the ``creative \ntension'' in the health care delivery system involving providers and \ninsurers, and noted Senate consideration of the `` antitrust \nrequirements in current law.'' He concluded that the Senate bill, which \nhad no such special antitrust rule, met the goals of providing real \nhealth care choices while making sure that there is accountability. \nThus, no special antitrust rule was considered necessary when the \nSenate debated its Medicare reform package in its budget reconciliation \nbill a short time ago.\n  These provisions threaten significant injury to competition outside \nthe Medicare program. By allowing competing providers to share \ninformation about ``costs, sales, profitability, marketing, prices, or \nfees'' and to agree on prices in the context of MedicarePlus, the \nexemption is likely to have the effect of dampening competition among \nthose same providers for non-MedicarePlus business. For this reason \namong others, special antitrust rules of this type are opposed by the \nU.S. Chamber of Commerce, the National Business Coalition on Health, \nthe National Manufacturers Association, the ERISA Industry Committee, \nthe Business Roundtable, the APPWP--The Benefits Association, and the \nNational Association of Attorneys General.\n  No language--and certainly not the fig leaf provided in proposed \nsection 1853(f)(1)(B)(ii), which purports to limit the information \nexchanged among providers affiliated with a PSO to having not been used \nfor any other purpose than to establish the PSO--can effectively \nprevent against this spillover effect.\n  Once putative competitors are authorized by statute to share \ninformation about ``costs, sales, profitability, marketing, prices'' \nand fees and to agree on prices for MedicarePlus, they cannot and will \nnot be able to ignore that knowledge they already possess when it comes \nto setting their prices for others.\n  Providers who agree on prices to be demanded from PSOs or as PSOs may \nimplicitly agree to adhere to similar prices with respect to other \nactivities or moderate their competitive behavior based on the \nknowledge gained thereby. Once competing providers have met to \nnegotiate their fees, the information they have exchanged and the \nunderstandings they have reached would likely spill over into their \nother dealings and into non-MedicarePlus areas in which health care \nservices ought to be governed by competitive forces.\n  Thus, Gail R. Wilensky, Ph.D., the Chair of the Physician Payment \nReview Commission, recently testified on September 22, 1995, before the \nHouse Ways and Means Committee on Medicare Reform that ``even if a \nchange (in the antitrust laws) applies only to the Medicare market, it \nmay be difficult to keep potentially anticompetitive practices from \nspilling into other markets served by the networks.''\n  We do not need to enact such provisions and certainly should not do \nso as part of budget reconciliation. I object and trust my colleagues \nwill not approve such changes in our antitrust laws without proper \nanalysis, justification, study or debate.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Madam President, will the Senator from Vermont yield?\n  Mr. LEAHY. Certainly.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I apologize for the second time for interrupting the \ndistinguished Senator from Vermont. We want to accommodate a number of \nschedules, and the clock is ticking. I am trying to see if we can \naccommodate all Senators and arrive at a unanimous consent agreement \nthat will allow us to vote. The distinguished Senator from Florida had \nsome questions.\n  If we could have the unanimous consent request again propounded with \nthe understanding that, in addition to the 30 seconds for the Senator \nfrom New Mexico, the Senator from Florida could have 1 minute to ask \nsome questions, and I would ask unanimous consent that be included, and \npose the motion at this time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? If not, the Chair \nunderstands that there will be 30 seconds for the Senator from New \nMexico, and the Senator from Vermont would have 30 seconds.\n  Mr. LEAHY. No, the Senator from Vermont would complete his statement \nat which point I understand that the Senator from Florida would have a \nminute, the Senator from New Mexico would have 30 seconds, and then we \nwould have the vote that was discussed before.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KYL. Madam President, I further ask unanimous consent that, if \nthe motion to waive is not agreed to and the point of order is \nsustained, that the \n\n[[Page S 17323]]\nSenate proceed immediately to vote on the motion to concur with the \nSenate amendment to the House amendment with no further action or \ndebate, other than 5 minutes for each leader or manager, and that the \nvote be limited to 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Reserving the right to object, I thought I was going to \nget 5 minutes also.\n  Mr. KYL. For each leader and manager, I will amend the request. I am \nsorry. I misread that--each leader and manager.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, to accommodate those Senators who have \nschedules and other debates, I will wrap up with this.\n  The Byrd rule was put here by the distinguished senior Senator from \nWest Virginia because this reconciliation process changes the normal \nprocedures of the Senate. It changes the normal unlimited debate. It \nwas done to handle these fiscal matters, and not to allow a whole lot \nof things to come in without the debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. LEAHY. No. Madam President. That was not the unanimous consent \nrequest, I say to the Chair. The unanimous consent request was that at \nthe conclusion of my time we would have a minute for the Senator from \nFlorida, and 30 seconds for the Senator from New Mexico.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator from Vermont has \nexpired. He had 8 minutes, and the time has expired.\n  Mr. LEAHY. The Chair is correct in that.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the material of the Chamber of Commerce, \nthe National Business Coalition, Health, the National Association of \nAttorneys General and others, who objected to this provision be printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                         Federal Trade Commission,\n\n\n                                        Department of Justice,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, October 31, 1995.\n     Hon. Patrick J. Leahy,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Leahy: The Federal Trade Commission and the \n     Department of Justice (the ``Agencies'') are writing in \n     response to your letters of October 26, 1995, requesting the \n     Agencies' comments on two antitrust provisions in H.R. 2425, \n     the Medicare Preservation Act of 1995. The Administration \n     supports the increased availability of provider networks to \n     promote competition and expand competitive choices for \n     consumers. Further, the Administration believes that \n     legislative reforms, which include appropriate consumer \n     protection safeguards, are necessary to achieve this goal. \n     The Federal Trade Commission has taken no position on aspects \n     of Medicare reform other than the comments in this letter on \n     the two antitrust provisions of H.R. 2425.\n       However, the two antitrust provisions of H.R. 2425--one a \n     broad exemption for medical self-regulatory entities and the \n     other a relaxation of antitrust rules for provider service \n     networks--are unnecessary and could seriously undermine the \n     cost containment goals of Medicare reform efforts. Moreover, \n     these provisions would deprive all consumers--not only \n     Medicare beneficiaries--of the benefits of competition in \n     health care markets. The Agencies urge that Congress not \n     enact these provisions.\n\n\n        antitrust exemption for medical self-regulatory entities\n\n       Section 15221 of H.R. 2425, ``Exemptions from Antitrust \n     Laws for Certain Activities of Medical Self-Regulatory \n     Entities,'' would create a special antitrust exemption for \n     medical groups' setting or enforcing of ``standards'' that \n     are ``designed to promote quality of health care services.'' \n     If enacted, it would provide broad antitrust immunity for \n     anticompetitive activities that purport to improve the \n     quality of care, but in fact raise health care costs and \n     deprive consumers of choices in the marketplace, by \n     anticompetitively excluding other economic participants from \n     health care markets.\n       Antitrust enforcement actions have stopped physicians, \n     acting through medical societies and hospital medical staffs \n     under the guise of quality concerns, from engaging in \n     boycotts, price fixing, and other conduct harmful to \n     consumers. These enforcement actions have been instrumental \n     in enabling competitive alternatives to traditional fee-for-\n     service medicine to enter health care markets in the face of \n     provider opposition. For example, the Agencies enforcement \n     actions have challenged: medical societies' standards that \n     banned procompetitive alternatives to traditional fee-for-\n     service medicine--including physicians' employment by HMOs \n     and affiliation with non-physicians; hospital medical staff \n     boycotts, coercion of hospitals, and abuse of the \n     credentialling process, to block the development of \n     innovative forms of health care delivery, such as health \n     maintenance organizations; and medical societies' boycotts of \n     insurers to force them to pay higher fees to the societies' \n     members.\n       The unfortunate fact is that self-regulatory bodies \n     sometimes act to obstruct competition, and when they do so \n     their actions are often couched in quality-of-care terms. \n     This kind of conduct is not a thing of the past. Continued \n     antitrust enforcement against such anticompetitive activities \n     is essential if competitive forces are to play a role in \n     containing health care costs.\n       Encouraging industry self-regulation that is aimed at \n     improving quality is a laudable goal, but legitimate self-\n     regulatory activity is already permitted under current \n     antitrust law. The Federal Trade Commission and the \n     Department of Justice have not brought suits against such \n     legitimate conduct. In fact, they have repeatedly spread the \n     message that such conduct is lawful.\n       The Report of the House Committee on Ways and Means on H.R. \n     2425 indicates that the exemption for medical self-regulation \n     is intended to address concerns about private lawsuits \n     challenging peer review. The Report states that the Health \n     Care Quality Improvement Act of 1986, 42 U.S.C. Sec. 11101, \n     which eliminated private damage actions for good faith peer \n     review that is undertaken with certain procedural safeguards, \n     has been beneficial, but that antitrust suits have continued. \n     Even if some unjustified suits continue to be brought, \n     concerns about possible imperfections in that statute's \n     limitations on private damage actions would not justify H.R. \n     2425's broad exemption from all antitrust enforcement, \n     particularly including actions by the government.\n       The potential harm from the broadly worded exemption is not \n     significantly limited by Section 15221(b)(2)'s exclusion from \n     immunity where conduct is undertaken ``for purposes \n     of financial gain.'' As noted above, quality of care is \n     typically offered as a justification for anticompetitive \n     conduct by health care providers, sometimes based on the \n     sincere--but erroneous--belief that competition is \n     inappropriate in the health care industry. Moreover, \n     making the availability of immunity turn on defendants' \n     intent, rather than on the objective market consequences \n     of the challenged behavior, offers no real protection for \n     consumers. The absence of a motive for personal financial \n     gain does not lessen the injury to consumers that occurs \n     when competitors engage in conduct that is unreasonably \n     anticompetitive.\n       The Congressional Budget Office concluded that this \n     provision would increase federal spending, rather than \n     promote the cost containment goals of H.R. 2425. And the \n     impact would not be limited to the Medicare program. Granting \n     private medical organizations the power to adopt and enforce \n     standards without the check against abuses that antitrust law \n     provides is likely to stifle innovation, unnecessarily limit \n     consumer choice, and frustrate health care cost containment \n     efforts.\n\n\n       special antitrust treatment for provider service networks\n\n       Section 15021 of Subtitle A of H.R. 2425, ``Special \n     Antitrust Rule for Provider Service Networks,'' would exempt \n     certain groups of health care providers from the per se rule \n     against price-fixing that applies throughout the rest of the \n     economy. This provision is not necessary for the development \n     of the provider-sponsored entities that the Medicare reform \n     bills seek to encourage. It could, however, both undercut \n     H.R. 2425's reliance on competition to provide more cost-\n     effective services to Medicare beneficiaries, and impair non-\n     Medicare competition as well.\n       Like the Senate Medicare bill, H.R. 2425 would permit \n     certain provider organizations to contract directly with the \n     Medicare program to provide all covered services in return \n     for a monthly capitation payment. These organizations are \n     called ``provider service networks'' in the Senate bill and \n     ``provider-sponsored organizations'' (PSOs) in H.R. 2425. \n     ``Provider service networks'' (PSNs) under H.R. 2425 are \n     groups of providers that may contract with a PSO--in essence \n     as subcontractors--to provide services to Medicare \n     beneficiaries.\n       Section 15021(a) provides that the conduct of a PSN or its \n     members in fixing prices would be evaluated only under the \n     ``rule of reason'' antitrust analysis, rather than under the \n     ``per se'' rule usually applicable to price fixing by \n     competitors. Legitimate provider joint ventures already \n     receive ``rule of reason'' treatment, for example, where \n     their members share substantial financial risk. This is \n     because risk-sharing among members of such a group gives each \n     member the incentive to assure that the group as a whole \n     provides services in a cost-effective manner, achieving \n     efficiencies and cost-savings that competition is intended to \n     secure. Under Section 15021(a), however, members of a PSN who \n     do not share any financial risk, and thus do not have those \n     same incentives for cost-savings, would be able to set fees \n     collectively for services provided through a PSO without \n     regard to the usual ``per se'' rule against price fixing.\n       No special antitrust rule is necessary to allow providers \n     to form groups or networks, develop fee schedules for \n     participating providers, or set up providers panels, so long \n     as the providers share financial risk. In fact, \n\n[[Page S 17324]]\n     risk-sharing among providers in a group appears integral to the \n     purposes of the legislation: PSOs and other entities offering \n     Medicare products are required to assume full financial risk \n     for the provision of all covered services, in exchange for a \n     predetermined capitation payment. Under existing antitrust \n     law, such groups already receive rule of reason treatment, \n     and any other provider group that similarly shares financial \n     risks would receive the same antitrust treatment. H.R. 2425 \n     would allow PSNs that do not involve risk-sharing to qualify \n     for special antitrust treatment by meeting certain criteria. \n     However, none of these criteria is a substitute for the \n     incentives created by substantial financial risk-sharing.\n       The goal of promoting more cost-effective delivery of \n     Medicare services would not be furthered by allowing groups \n     of competing providers in a PSN to agree on the prices they \n     would demand from the PSO for treating patients under a \n     Medicare PSO contract, bargain collectively with the PSO, and \n     threaten a boycott if the PSO did not accept the providers' \n     terms. In such a case, even though the anticompetitive effect \n     of the conduct is clear and no countervailing efficiencies \n     are produced, the bill would require the antitrust agencies \n     to conduct a resource-intensive analysis of the market under \n     the rule of reason. Given the constraints on federal \n     antitrust enforcement resources, this can only mean that some \n     plainly anticompetitive activities will go unprosecuted.\n       The impact of the exemption could also extend beyond PSOs \n     to all managed care organizations operating in a particular \n     market. By allowing competing providers to agree on prices in \n     the context of bargaining to provide services to a Medicare \n     PSO, the exemption could have the unintended effect of \n     dampening competition among those same providers for non-PSO \n     business. Providers who agree on prices to be demanded of \n     PSOs may implicitly agree to adhere to similar demands when \n     dealing with other plans. Even absent bad intentions, once \n     competing providers have met to negotiate their fees for PSO \n     business, the information they have exchanged and the \n     understandings they have reached would likely spill over into \n     their dealings not only with other MedicarePlus \n     organizations, but also with the various organizations that \n     provide health care benefits to non-Medicare patients.\n       In sum, the antitrust provision in H.R. 2425 would harm \n     consumers and would run counter to the cost-reduction goals \n     of Medicare reform efforts.\n       The Department of Justice has be advised by the Office of \n     Management and Budget that there is no objection to the \n     submission of this letter from the standpoint of the \n     Administration's program.\n           Sincerely,\n     Anne K. Bingaman,\n       Assistant Attorney General.\n       By direction of the Commission.\n     Robert Pitofsky,\n       Chairman.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                               September 26, 1995.\n     Hon. William V. Roth, Jr.,\n     Chairman, Committee on Finance\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: We are a coalition of physician group \n     practices, non-physician providers, employers, managed care \n     networks and insurers who are opposed to including special \n     antitrust preferences for physicians as part of Medicare \n     reform legislation.\n       Physicians are not alone in feeling the pressure of \n     increased competition. All of us doing business in the health \n     care market are facing increased competition. Yet, we do not \n     believe that competitive pressures warrant special antitrust \n     preferences for physicians or any other provider. Such \n     preferences are unnecessary and harmful to competition and \n     consumer choice in the marketplace. If the goal is to apply \n     the successes of the private health care market to reforming \n     the Medicare program, then weakening the antitrust laws for \n     physicians is truly misguided. Senior citizens and all \n     consumers should have health plan choices--but choices that \n     are indeed competitive.\n       The attached Washington Post article underscores the need \n     to maintain strong antitrust enforcement in order to ensure \n     that consumers, not competitors, determine the range and \n     prices of goods and services offered in the health care \n     marketplace.\n       Unfortunately, the American Medical Association (AMA) is \n     seeking special treatment under the antitrust laws. Under the \n     AMA's proposal, physicians would be allowed to agree on the \n     prices they will charge and collectively negotiate with \n     lawyers while essentially remaining individual competitors. \n     In other words, little substantial risk-sharing on the part \n     of physicians would be required, effectively reducing \n     incentives to compete on cost, quality and efficiency. In \n     addition, physician networks would be subject to more lenient \n     enforcement of the law than all other providers.\n       Advocates of changes to the law contend that current \n     antitrust laws and enforcement must be relaxed to allow \n     physicians to compete on a ``level playing field'' with other \n     network organizers such as hospitals. HMOs and insurers. \n     While this argument may appear reasonable at a glance, a \n     closer examination of the issue reveals quite the opposite. \n     The antitrust changes that the AMA seeks to include as part \n     of Medicare reform are little more than well-disguised \n     attempts to side-step the strong free market protections \n     afforded by current law.\n       The following briefing paper tells the real story.\n           Sincerely,\n         American Group Practice Association, American Association \n           of Nurse Anesthetists, Academy of Nurse Practitioners, \n           American Nurses Association, AETNA, American Managed \n           Care and Review Association, American College of Nurse \n           Mid-wives, Association of Private Pension and Welfare \n           Plans, American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, \n           Blue Cross & Blue Shield Association, CIGNA, FHP Health \n           Care, Group Health Association of America, Health Care \n           Compare, Corp., Health Insurance Association of \n           America, Kaiser Permanente, Kansas City Blue Cross & \n           Blue Shield, Metrahealth, National Association of \n           Manufacturers, National Capital PPO, Nat's Assoc. of \n           Nurse Practitioners in Reproductive Health, Opticians \n           Association of America, Sierra Health Services, The \n           Erisa Industry Committee, The Principal Financial \n           Group, The Prudential, U.S. Healthcare, Inc., Wausau \n           Insurance Companies.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n               [From the Washington Post, Sept. 14, 1995]\n\n              Doctors, Hospitals Sued on Monopoly Charges\n\n       The Justice Department yesterday charged doctors and \n     hospitals in two states with using monopoly power to block \n     lower-priced managed health care systems from competing--in \n     one case for almost a decade.\n       It was the first time the agency's anti-trust division \n     filed price-fixing lawsuits accusing hospitals of scheming \n     with doctors to ensure their own higher profits while health \n     care costs rise.\n       Both groups--in Danbury, Conn., and St. Joseph, Mo--denied \n     the charges. But both also agreed to consent decrees in which \n     they promised to change the way they do business.\n       The complaint said that beginning in May 1994 and \n     continuing through August, Danbury Hospital, the only \n     acutecare facility in the area, forced patients to use its \n     outpatient facilities, joined with ``virtually all of the \n     doctors on its medical staff' to raise fees, and purposely \n     limited the size and mix of its medical staff to reduce \n     competition among local doctors.\n       In Missouri, the Justice Department said, the price-fixing \n     conspiracy occurred from April 1986 through June 1995. The \n     complaint said about 85 percent of the doctors in Buchanan \n     County formed a group in 1986 ``to prevent or delay the \n     development of managed care in the area.''\n       In 1990, the group then joined with the only local \n     hospital, Heartland, to form Health Choice to further lock up \n     the medical services and profits in the area, the lawsuit \n     said.\n\nSpecial Antitrust Preferences for Physicians Limit Competition, Choice \n                and Innovation in the Health Care Market\n\n       Current antitrust law does allow for the formation of \n     physician-sponsored networks.\n       Physicians can join together and agree on price and other \n     terms of business so long as they ``integrate'' by sharing \n     financial risk. Risk-sharing can be achieved in a variety of \n     ways and is critical to ensure that physicians do not come \n     together to simply fix prices while remaining separate \n     competitors. Numerous physician networks have successfully \n     ``integrated'' and are now competing in virtually every \n     market in the country. Some of the most notable examples are \n     the Mayo Clinic in Minnesota and the Cleveland Clinic in \n     Ohio. These multi-specialty physician group practices were \n     formed under existing antitrust laws, without special \n     preferences.\n       Alternatively physicians can also join together to form \n     Preferred Provider Organizations (PPOs) and negotiate fees \n     with HMOs and other third-party payers without integrating \n     their practices. These more loosely organized groups can \n     perform many of the same functions as their fully integrated \n     counterparts, including quality assurance, utilization \n     review, and administrative services. Guidelines issued by the \n     Department of Justice (DOJ) and the Federal Trade Commission \n     (FTC) make this clear.\n       Loosening integration requirements is harmful to consumers \n     because it reduces the incentive for providers to compete. \n     Current integration requirements are not barriers to the \n     formation physician-sponsored plans. They are barriers to \n     price-fixing, boycotts and other forms of anti-market \n     activities. Ultimately, substantial financial integration is \n     what drives competition on quality, efficiency and cost.\n       Physicians are not disadvantaged with respect to other \n     providers under the antitrust laws.\n       The purpose of strong antitrust enforcement policies is to \n     protect consumers, not competitors. The notion that \n     physicians need special antitrust preferences because the \n     antitrust laws are biased against physicians is inaccurate \n     and misleading. Joint ventures arranged by like competitors \n     in every other industry are subject to essentially the same \n     level of scrutiny as physician-sponsored networks.\n       Similarly, insurers and other providers are not exempt from \n     antitrust enforcement. If insurers either agreed among \n     themselves on payment levels or tried to wield market power \n     by driving prices down, they too would run afoul of the \n     antitrust laws.\n       In its 1995 Report to Congress, the Physician Payment \n     Review Commission (PPRC) \n\n[[Page S 17325]]\n     concluded that ``the available evidence of problems is not sufficient \n     to warrant creating safe harbors or other exemptions from the \n     antitrust laws for physician-sponsored networks at this time. \n     Amending the antitrust laws is a serious step that should be \n     undertaken only in the face of compelling evidence that \n     change is required. The limited available factual evidence, \n     however, does not currently suggest the widespread existence \n     of problems.''\n       Consequently, what the AMA is really asking for is the \n     ability to compete outside the free market principles that \n     every other competitor must abide by.\n       Special antitrust treatment for physicians, such as loose \n     integration requirements and substitution of the rule of \n     reason for the per se rule would diminish consumer power in \n     the marketplace.\n       A number of changes to the antitrust laws have been \n     advocated by the AMA, ranging from outright exemptions to \n     relaxing risk-sharing requirements and elimination of the per \n     se rule. The per se rule has allowed the courts and \n     enforcement agencies to efficiently call a halt to activities \n     that are blatantly harmful to consumers. It reflects a \n     determination that some conduct--such as price-fixing and \n     group boycotts--is so likely to harm consumers that it should \n     be found unlawful in all circumstances. It is a rule that \n     applies to all providers and all industries.\n       The rule of reason, in contrast, requires a balancing of \n     the competitive harm arising from particular conduct against \n     the possible economic benefits it produces. However, it is \n     also more difficult under this rule to challenge \n     anticompetitive conduct because many more creative defenses \n     and justifications can be raised. If antitrust enforcement \n     agencies could only prosecute antitrust violations by \n     provider physician-sponsored networks under the rule of \n     reason, they would be forced to utilize greater resources and \n     face a reduced likelihood of success. If rule of reason \n     treatment was extended to provider-sponsored networks, but \n     not to other types of health care networks, provider \n     organizations would enjoy distinct advantages that would not \n     be shared by other health plans. This would put those plans \n     at a competitive disadvantage.\n       History is replete with examples of physician group \n     boycotts and efforts to keep other physician group practices \n     and non-physicians, such as nurse mid-wives and nurse \n     anesthetists, from offering consumers choice. One of the best \n     examples of this is the experience of the physician-owned \n     Cleveland Clinic. In 1991, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) \n     put a halt to physician boycotts aimed at preventing \n     Cleveland Clinic doctors from establishing a practice in \n     Florida. This case was brought under the per se rule--the \n     very rule from which AMA seeks an exemption. Similarly, prior \n     to 1979, the AMA bound its members to rules that prevented \n     physicians from contracting with HMOs. These rules \n     effectively prevented price competition among doctors and \n     hindered the development of new, innovative health care \n     delivery systems, such as HMOs and PPOs. The Supreme Court \n     agreed and forced the AMA to drop its anticompetitive rules.\n       The DOJ and FTC have provided substantial guidance to \n     health care providers to address their concerns.\n       In response to concerns raised by providers, the Department \n     of Justice (DOJ) and the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) \n     jointly issued the Statements of Antitrust Enforcement Policy \n     in the Health Care Area. These statements, or guidelines, \n     provide a detailed road map of the analysis that the federal \n     enforcement agencies will apply to the most significant \n     issues facing the health care industry. The guidelines \n     include ``safety zones'' clarifying what types of mergers, \n     joint ventures, and other activities would be considered \n     lawful. The DOJ/FTC have made a special effort to address \n     physician networks and rural health care markets.\n       For physicians and other providers who have questions about \n     forming integrated networks, the agencies offer opportunities \n     for more specific advice through their business review and \n     advisory opinion letter process. The agencies' business \n     review and advisory opinion procedures allow parties to \n     obtain a statement of the agencies' enforcement intentions \n     before the transaction is implemented. The agencies have \n     committed to providing expedited 90-day reviews. The agencies \n     have also committed to continued monitoring of evolving \n     health care markets so they can respond to changes on an on-\n     going basis. To date, virtually every physician-sponsored \n     network has been approved.\n       The health care industry has responded enthusiastically to \n     these initiatives. According to a January 1995 Bureau of \n     National Affairs (BNA) survey of counselors advising \n     providers, the ``almost blanket clearances by the Justice \n     Department and FTC of proposals to create managed care \n     networks is assuaging health care industry concerns about the \n     impact of antitrust law . . .''\n                                                                    ____\n\n         Business for Medicare Reform: APPWP--The Benefits \n           Association; The Business Roundtable; The ERISA \n           Industry Committee; National Association of \n           Manufacturers; National Business Coalition on Health; \n           U.S. Chamber of Commerce,\n                                                 October 17, 1995.\n     Hon.

William Thomas.\n       Dear Representatives: We are writing as representatives of \n     small and large businesses who have been supportive of your \n     efforts to save Medicare by passing the Medicare Preservation \n     Act. We have been gratified by the commitment you have made \n     to fundamentally restructuring Medicare by drawing on the \n     successful health care reform strategies pioneered by private \n     employers. Moreover, employers have been willing to accept \n     considerable costs in order to save Medicare.\n       Just a very few years ago, most health care policymakers \n     and analysts believed that the private sector could not \n     contain health care costs. Employers have proved this wrong, \n     by using their purchasing power to create more competitive \n     markets and demanding better care at lower cost. Based on our \n     knowledge of what it took to get this job done, we have \n     important reservations about a limited number of the Medicare \n     Preservation Act's provisions. We are concerned that these \n     provisions would undermine the very strategies that (a) \n     employers have used to control costs and improve quality and \n     (b) the Act uses as the foundation for a new and sustainable \n     Medicare program. We urge you to reconsider these provisions.\n       Our most important concerns are as follows:\n       Antitrust Changes for Health Care Providers. We are \n     extremely concerned by the antitrust law changes included in \n     Sections 15021 and 15221 of the Act, which would affect \n     employer-sponsored health plans as well as MedicarePlus \n     plans. We ask that they be stricken.\n       Unfortunately, organized medicine has a long history of \n     attempting to suppress alternative health care delivery \n     systems. Antitrust enforcement has been an important tool in \n     overcoming this opposition to innovative ways of delivering \n     higher quality care at lower cost. Section 15221's changes to \n     antitrust law would allow organized medicine to engage in a \n     much higher level of anticompetitive activity, thereby \n     increasing costs and reducing the quality of care. In \n     contrast, employers have created the new, competitive health \n     care market and better ways to measure and improve quality \n     under current antitrust law, which also leaves broad \n     leeway for health care providers to collaborate in \n     legitimate self-regulatory activity.\n       Employers have been able to control costs and improve \n     quality by using their purchasing power to create competitive \n     health care markets. The antitrust law changes in Section \n     15021 would shift the balance between health care providers \n     and purchasers in favor of providers, undermining employers' \n     ability to be effective purchasers and jeopardizing their \n     hard won victories over health care cost inflation and poor \n     quality care. Putting purchasers at a disadvantage by \n     changing antitrust law risks a return to health care \n     hyperinflation and unaccountability for quality.\n       Medical Liability Reforms. Employers have long supported \n     medical liability reform, including changes to the collateral \n     source rule. However, the version of collateral source rule \n     reform in the Act eliminates employers' right of subrogation. \n     This shifts the cost of treating injuries caused by a \n     negligent provider from the provider who caused the injury to \n     employers. We urge that you revise the Act to provide for a \n     different version of collateral source rule reform that \n     appropriately prevents double recovery by plaintiffs without \n     inappropriately shifting responsibility for injuries caused \n     by negligent providers to employers.\n       Medicare Secondary Payer Expansions. The Act expands \n     employers' Medicare secondary payer liability. This does \n     nothing to improve health care efficiency or quality. Rather, \n     it simply shifts costs to private sector payers. Small \n     employers in particular are vulnerable to this kind of cost-\n     shifting. We urge that the expansions of Medicare secondary \n     payer liability be eliminated.\n       As you know, managed care plans able to efficiently deliver \n     high quality care have played a key role in employers' \n     market-based health reform strategy. No aspect of the \n     Medicare Preservation Act is more important to employers than \n     its treatment of managed care plans. We are gratified that \n     the Act as introduced by Chairman Archer and Chairman Bliley \n     did not include antimanaged care rules. Including antimanaged \n     care rules in the Act would increase costs and reduce \n     quality. Moreover, including antimanaged care rules would \n     directly and adversely affect employer-sponsored health plans \n     as well as MedicarePlus plans, since the same networks will \n     serve Medicare beneficiaries and employer-sponsored plans.\n       It is our understanding that most of the antimanaged care \n     rules adopted in committee as amendments to the Act have been \n     stricken. (These amendments included restrictions on (1) the \n     criteria health plans may use when selecting providers, (2) \n     efforts to eliminate medically inappropriate emergency room \n     treatment and (3) denial of care that is not medically \n     necessary.) We applaud this result. We urge you to strike the \n     remaining antimanaged care amendment (restricting permissible \n     contractual relationships between health plans and providers) \n     and to continue adhering to the policy of avoiding \n     antimanaged care rules as the Medicare Preservation Act moves \n     through the legislative process.\n\n[[Page S 17326]]\n\n       It also is our understanding that a technical error in the \n     medical liability reforms that would have inadvertently \n     expanded employers' liability by interfering with current \n     grievance procedures provided for under the Employee \n     Retirement Income Security Act has been resolved. We \n     appreciate your efforts to resolve this matter, which is \n     vitally important to employers who voluntarily sponsor health \n     benefits for their employees.\n       Again, we strongly support your efforts to save Medicare. \n     It is essential that they succeed. However, as \n     representatives of the businesses that originated the \n     strategies that the Medicare Preservation Act is built on, we \n     urge adoption of a few technical changes that would greatly \n     strengthen the Act's ability to achieve its goals. These \n     changes also would eliminate our concerns about the Act's \n     effects on businesses that voluntarily offer health benefits \n     to their employees.\n       We would be pleased to further discuss these issues with \n     you at your convenience.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                         U.S. Chamber of Commerce,\n\n\n                                 Business for Medicare Reform,\n\n                                                 October 23, 1995.\n     Hon. William V. Roth, Jr.,\n     Chairman, Finance Committee,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Roth. We are writing as representatives of \n     small and large businesses that are working hard to control \n     health care costs and improve quality. We have been gratified \n     by the Finance Committee's decision to fundamentally improve \n     Medicare by drawing on the successful health reform \n     strategies pioneered by private employers.\n       Just a few years ago, most health care policymakers \n     believed that the private sector could not contain health \n     care costs. Employers have proved this wrong, by using their \n     purchasing power to create more competitive markets, \n     demanding better care at lower costs, measuring outcomes and \n     consumer satisfaction, and developing networks through \n     selective contracting with the best providers. Based on our \n     knowledge of what it took to get this job done, we are \n     concerned that potential floor amendments to the Finance \n     Committee bill would undermine the very strategies that (a) \n     employers have used to control costs and improve quality and \n     (b) the bill uses as the foundation for a new and sustainable \n     Medicare program. These potential amendments include \n     antitrust exemptions for health care providers and mandated \n     point-of-service coverage by network-based plans. We strongly \n     oppose these potential amendments to the Finance Committee \n     bill.\n       The damage that would be caused by adding these amendments \n     to Medicare reform legislation would not be limited to higher \n     Medicare costs and lower quality. Because Medicare is such a \n     large factors in health care markets and because Medicare and \n     employer-sponsored health plans will use the same provider \n     networks, antitrust exceptions for providers and antimanaged \n     care rules would directly harm employer-sponsored plans. \n     Working Americans and their families would face higher costs, \n     reduced coverage and lower quality.\n\n\n                   opposition to antitrust exemptions\n\n       One potential amendment would grant an antitrust exemption \n     to medical self-regulatory organizations. Unfortunately, \n     organized medicine has a long history of attempting to \n     suppress coordinated health care delivery systems. Antitrust \n     enforcement has been an important tool in overcoming this \n     opposition to innovative ways of delivering higher quality \n     care at lower cost. An antitrust exemption for medical self-\n     regulatory organizations would allow organized medicine to \n     engage in a much higher level of anticompetitive activity, \n     thereby increasing costs and reducing the quality of care. \n     Notably, current antitrust law leaves broad leeway for health \n     care providers to collaborate in legitimate self-regulatory \n     activity.\n       Employer-led efforts to improve accountability and quality \n     in the health care system by making data available to health \n     care consumers has been a leading cause of the positive \n     changes in the health care market. This data has become \n     available--often in the face of provider resistance--only \n     because private employees took the initiative to develop it \n     and demand that providers supply it. Granting providers an \n     antitrust exemption, thereby permitting them to monopolize \n     the quality standard-setting process, will seriously erode \n     accountability for quality and value.\n       Another potential antitrust amendment would grant an \n     exemption to provider-sponsored organizations. Employers have \n     been able to control costs and improve quality by using their \n     purchasing power to create competitive health care markets. \n     An antitrust exemption for provider-sponsored organizations \n     would shift the balance between health care providers and \n     purchasers in favor of providers, undermining employers' \n     ability to be effective purchasers. Putting purchasers at a \n     disadvantage by changing antitrust law risks a return to \n     health care hyperinflation and unaccountability for quality.\n\n\n                 opposition to point-of-service mandate\n\n       A recent Lewin-VHI study found that a point-of-service \n     mandate would add even more to the nation's health care bill \n     than an ``any willing provider'' mandate. Experience confirms \n     a point-of-service mandate's high cost. A study of Florida \n     employers' 1993 health crisis found that point-of-service \n     plans cost over 20 percent more than HMOs. Prohibiting \n     closed-panel plans from participating in Medicare would force \n     even those Medicare beneficiaries who want to enroll in a \n     closed-panel plan--such as the 3 million seniors who already \n     have chosen such plans over the traditional Medicare system--\n     to pay higher premiums.\n       A point-of-service mandate undermines the entire purpose of \n     Medicare reform. Because the traditional Medicare program is \n     unsustainable, the Finance Committee bill encourages \n     beneficiaries to shift to private health plans. A point-of-\n     service mandate would drive up private plans' costs, \n     encouraging continued enrollment in the government-run \n     system. As a result, Medicare reform would fail to produce a \n     modernized, more efficient Medicare.\n       Both point-of-service plans and closed panel plans have \n     earned an important place in the market--based on consumers' \n     choices, not government mandates. In fact, employers have \n     found that employee enrollment in closed panel HMOs increased \n     at the same time that point-of-service plan availability and \n     enrollment increased. Market forces rather than government \n     microregulation should determine point-of-service plans' role \n     in Medicare. Certainly, the federal government should not \n     deny consumers the freedom to choose and the savings of \n     private health plans that only contract with selected \n     providers. Moreover, the Finance Committee bill requires all \n     plans that only contract with selected providers, like every \n     other private plan (but not the traditional government-run \n     Medicare program), to meet quality standards.\n       The Finance Committee made the right choice by keeping \n     antitrust exemptions for organized medicine and a point-of-\n     service mandate out of its Medicare reform bill. We urge you \n     to oppose any floor amendments that would add these \n     provisions, or any other antimanaged care rules, to the \n     Finance Committee's Medicare bill.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                           National Association of\n\n\n                                            Attorneys General,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, October 26, 1995.\n     Hon. Newt Gingrich,\n     Speaker of the House, House of Representatives,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Speaker Gingrich: As Chair and Vice-Chair of the \n     Antitrust Committee and Chair and Vice-Chair of the Health \n     Care Task Force of the National Association of Attorneys \n     General (NAAG), we are writing to express our concern about \n     two antitrust provisions included in H.R. 2425, the Medicare \n     Preservation Act of 1995. These provisions, sections 15021 \n     and 15221 of the Act, are unnecessary and could frustrate the \n     cost-containment goals of the Medicare legislation. We urge \n     that these provisions not be included in the final Medicare \n     reform package.\n       The Attorneys General, as chief law officers of their \n     states, are the primary enforcers of the states' antitrust \n     law, and also represent their states and the citizens of \n     their states in federal antitrust litigation. As chief legal \n     officers, the Attorneys General have had and continue to have \n     an important role in the development of national competition \n     policy. We know first-hand that the antitrust laws benefit \n     consumers by protecting competition and promoting efficiency, \n     innovation, low prices, better management and greater \n     consumer choice. Although the Attorneys General as a group \n     have not had an opportunity to consider this legislation, \n     past NAAG policy positions have consistently opposed both new \n     antitrust exemptions and the weakening of antitrust \n     enforcement standards for specific industries.\n       Section 15221 of the Act provides an exemption from both \n     state and federal antitrust laws for activity relating to \n     medical self-regulation. We believe that inclusion of this \n     provision is inadvisable. Unfortunately, state Attorneys \n     General have had experience with physicians and other health \n     care providers who have engaged in anticompetitive \n     activities, including physicians' attempts to eliminate \n     competition from HMOs, PPOs and allied health care \n     professionals. For this reason, in a 1993 Resolution, the \n     Attorneys General stated their belief that exempting health \n     care providers from the antitrust laws is undesirable. Nor is \n     the exemption contained in section 15221 necessary. Current \n     antitrust law permits collaborative activities, including \n     standard-setting activities, that benefit the public and do \n     not injure competition.\n       Section 15021 of the Act provides that certain actions of a \n     provider service network or an individual member of that \n     network shall not be deemed illegal per se under either \n     federal or state antitrust law, but shall instead be judged \n     under the ``rule of reason.'' We are concerned that this \n     relaxation of antitrust standards could lead to higher \n     prices and fewer choices for consumers. Under current law, \n     per se treatment is reserved for the most anticompetitive \n     conduct, including horizontal price-fixing. As stated in a \n     1986 NAAG Resolution, the Attorneys General oppose new \n     industry-specific antitrust standards because present \n     antitrust standards adequately protect the interests of \n     businesses, as well as consumers, by preventing activities \n     that have no pro-competitive justification. More \n     specifically, in the health care area, the Attorneys \n     General believe that competition promotes more affordable \n     health care, development of innovative new delivery \n     systems, and increased information for health care \n     consumers.\n       Finally, we are concerned about the broad preemption of \n     state antitrust enforcement, particularly in section 15221, \n     which is not limited to protection of activities within the \n     Medicare program. In a 1994 Resolution, the \n\n[[Page S 17327]]\n     Attorneys General opposed preemption of state antitrust enforcement in \n     the health care area because such preemption crodes state \n     sovereignty and threatens the system of federalism \n     established by the Constitution. Health care is predominately \n     a local industry that varies significantly from state to \n     state. The Attorneys General, as chief law enforcement \n     officers, should continue to be able to prevent \n     anticompetitive behavior within each state.\n       If you have any questions about our views, please feel free \n     to contact us or Emily Myers, NAAG Counsel for Antitrust and \n     Health at (202) 434-8015.\n           Very truly yours,\n     J. Joseph Curran, Jr.,\n       Attorney General of Maryland, Chair, NAAG Antitrust \n     Committee.\n     Tom Miller,\n       Attorney General of Iowa, Vice-Chair, NAAG Antitrust \n     Committee.\n     Pamela Fanning Carter,\n       Attorney General of Indiana, Chair, NAAG Health Care Task \n     Force.\n     Jeffrey L. Amestoy,\n       Attorney General of Vermont, Vice-Chair, NAAG Health Care \n     Task Force.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                                November 17, 1995.\n       Dear Senator. It is our understanding that the \n     reconciliation bill before the Senate includes a number of \n     anti-consumer provisions which may violate the Byrd rule. \n     Those provisions include antitrust exemptions for provider \n     service networks, elimination of laboratory testing standards \n     for most tests performed in physician offices, preemption of \n     state authority to implement consumer protection standards \n     for managed care plans and physician self-referral.\n       On behalf of the following organizations, we strongly ask \n     that you support every effort to remove these harmful \n     provisions from the reconciliation bill. Inclusion of the \n     items listed above will drive up costs, threaten patient \n     safety and reduce the quality of health care for all \n     Americans.\n           Sincerely,\n         AIDS Action Council, American Public Health Association, \n           Church Women United, Citizen Action, Consumer \n           Federation of America, Consumers Union, National \n           Association of Social Workers, National Farmers Union, \n           National Council of Senior Citizens, Neighbor To \n           Neighbor, Public Citizen's Congress Watch, Service \n           Employees International Union.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida is recognized for a \nminute.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Madam President, I would like to ask if the Senator from \nArizona would please respond to a question. I hope they could be \nanswered ``yes'' or ``no''.\n  Mr. KYL. If I can.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Does this provision relate exclusively to the Federal, or \ndoes it apply to State antitrust law?\n  Mr. KYL. My understanding is that it applies to both Federal and \nState.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Please refer to the bottom line, page 17, No. 2. Does \nthis provision relate exclusively to Medicaid, or does it apply to \nother forms of health care?\n  Mr. KYL. It refers only to the Medicare contracts, and the \norganizations pursuant to obtaining the Medicare contract.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. I would ask the Senator to refer to 318, paragraph B.\n  Thank you, Madam President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, the Byrd rule was put into effect--not \nthat it would rule all the time but that it would be waived.\n  I submit that anybody in this body that wants the Medicare law to \nwork in rural areas, if you talked to anybody in rural areas, they will \ntell you one of the most important things pending before us, to see \nthat we get delivery in rural areas, is this provision which is being \ndropped, if we make it subject to the Byrd rule. Because, without it in \nrural areas there will be no ability for doctors and hospitals in the \nrural areas to get together and have new units to deliver health care. \nThere will be no competition and no service except for monster HMOs in \nthe rural areas.\n  We really ought to waive the Byrd rule in this instance.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has expired. The question is on \nagreeing to the motion to waive the Congressional Budget Act with \nrespect to the antitrust provision. On this question, the yeas and nays \nhave been ordered, and the clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Are there any other Senators in the Chamber \nwho desire to vote?\n  The yeas and nays resulted--yeas 54, nays 45, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 583 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--54\n\n     Abraham\n     Ashcroft\n     Baucus\n     Bennett\n     Bond\n     Breaux\n     Brown\n     Burns\n     Campbell\n     Coats\n     Cochran\n     Cohen\n     Coverdell\n     Craig\n     D'Amato\n     DeWine\n     Dole\n     Domenici\n     Faircloth\n     Frist\n     Gorton\n     Gramm\n     Grams\n     Grassley\n     Gregg\n     Hatch\n     Hatfield\n     Helms\n     Hutchison\n     Inhofe\n     Jeffords\n     Kassebaum\n     Kempthorne\n     Kyl\n     Lott\n     Lugar\n     Mack\n     McCain\n     McConnell\n     Murkowski\n     Nickles\n     Nunn\n     Pressler\n     Roth\n     Santorum\n     Shelby\n     Simpson\n     Smith\n     Snowe\n     Stevens\n     Thomas\n     Thompson\n     Thurmond\n     Warner\n\n                                NAYS--45\n\n     Akaka\n     Biden\n     Bingaman\n     Boxer\n     Bradley\n     Bryan\n     Bumpers\n     Byrd\n     Chafee\n     Conrad\n     Daschle\n     Dodd\n     Dorgan\n     Exon\n     Feingold\n     Feinstein\n     Ford\n     Glenn\n     Graham\n     Harkin\n     Heflin\n     Hollings\n     Inouye\n     Johnston\n     Kennedy\n     Kerrey\n     Kerry\n     Kohl\n     Lautenberg\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Lieberman\n     Mikulski\n     Moseley-Braun\n     Moynihan\n     Murray\n     Pell\n     Pryor\n     Reid\n     Robb\n     Rockefeller\n     Sarbanes\n     Simon\n     Specter\n     Wellstone\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. On this vote, the yeas are 54, the nays are \n45. Three-fifths of the Senators duly chosen and sworn not having voted \nin the affirmative, the motion is not agreed to.\n  The Chair is prepared to rule on the points of order made by the \nSenator from Nebraska.\n  The Chair sustains both points of order.\n  The question before the Senate is whether the Senate shall recede \nfrom its amendment to H.R. 2491 and concur therein with a further \namendment. Pursuant to the Budget Act, that amendment is the text of \nthe conference report (House Report 104-350) excluding the provisions \nstricken on the points of order.\n  According to the previous order, each leader and each manager have 5 \nminutes for debate.\n  Who seeks recognition? Who seeks recognition under the previous \norder? Under the previous order, each leader and each manager has 5 \nminutes.\n  The Senator from Nebraska is recognized for 5 minutes.\n  (Mr. GORTON assumed the chair.)\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, in a few minutes, the Senate will \nunfortunately adopt this conference report to the reconciliation bill.\n  Although I will not vote for the legislation, I certainly want to \ncongratulate Chairman Domenici for his leadership and for the many \nmonths of yeoman labor that he put in on this piece of legislation. He \nmade the hard choices, some good and, in my opinion, many bad, but he \nwas a true leader of great merit, and I congratulate him.\n  Mr. President, my colleagues on the other side of the aisle will \nsavor their victory, but I must also say to all Senators that it is \ntime to move on. With victory short lived and the fate of this bill \ncertain, it will soon take its place in veto history.\n  Mr. President, where do we go from here? In my 17 years in the \nSenate, I have never seen such a poisonous atmosphere as the one that \nhangs thick over the Nation's Capitol. The nervous truce that existed \nin January has collapsed. We are, in the words of President Lincoln, \n``a house divided against itself.'' I still nurture the hope that we \nwill find a way out of this morass and that our leaders--especially \nthose in the other body--will set aside pettiness, vanity, and rigid \nideology for the good of the Nation. There is no honor in the dishonor \nthat has been brought about by the actions of the last few days and the \nlast few hours.\n  I firmly believe, with every fiber in my body, that we should balance \nthe budget. So do the American people. It is the stark route that the \nRepublican majority took, however, that cleaves our ranks.\n  I tell my Republican friends that if we ever can come to an agreement \non a balanced budget, we cannot adhere to the current formulas that \nexist in the conference report. It hobbles any hope that we can redeem \nour differences in a constructive alliance to balance the budget. But \nwe must keep trying.\n  I yield my remaining time. \n\n[[Page S 17328]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from New \nMexico is recognized.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, fellow Senators, I have a lot of people \nto thank for this evening. While the Senators on that side do not think \nit is a very joyous or auspicious occasion, Senators on this side do, \nand I do. I have waited a long time, as a U.S. Senator, to see this \nevening arrive. It is truly a historic opportunity for politicians \nbecause, as I see it, this was the one chance we have to vote for the \nfuture. We have an opportunity every day to vote for something for \ntoday, a program for today, something to give to people today. But, \nessentially, what we are voting on this evening is a vote for the \nfuture of this country and for children not yet born and for those who \nare not yet receiving anything from the Federal Government, but who \nwant an opportunity and have a dream.\n  We are saying the one thing that makes that more and more difficult \nis 25 years of fiscal policy that has the United States borrowing as if \nno one else needed any money, as if those that work, those that need \ninvestment did not need money, just the Federal Government needed it. \nAnd it was like we were a money tree, America was a money tree, and the \nmoney all went to Washington. And when we did not have enough, we \nborrowed it from foreigners--from Japan, from our banks, from our \npeople. The question is: Who will pay the piper?\n  We have decided here tonight that the piper will not be our children \nand grandchildren, but rather in due course, the adults who live today \nwill pay for what we give to our people today and provide a future for \nour children and grandchildren.\n  Now, I understand that the President is going to veto this bill, and \nI have a word for the President. Since he has told us in advance, I \nwould like to tell him in advance. As he sits down with his veto pen, I \nhope he feels heavy, because on his shoulders is our future and our \nchildren's future. As he signs with that left hand of his, he better \nhave something pretty good in mind for our children in the future, \nbecause he is throwing away a real legacy of opportunity, and he better \nbe prepared to tell us and tell the American people and tell our senior \ncitizens what he has in mind, because I have not seen anything yet that \nhe has in mind that comes anywhere close to what we are giving to our \nchildren and grandchildren here tonight when we vote ``aye'' on this \nmeasure.\n  For those who have voted these many times--58 votes on the budget \nresolution, and I do not know how many different times--I say to each \none of them, your vote was not in vain. And if those on the other side \nand in the White House think they will use this against us, just think \nwhat we are going to use against them if this President vetoes this and \nwe end up with nothing.\n  For those who are against that, there is a real chance that we will \nget nothing, except $200 billion in deficits for as far as the eye can \nsee. I also say to those who voted for it, and will vote for it again \ntonight, you have changed the course of fiscal policy and the way we \nspend our people's money forever, because no longer will a Budget \nCommittee in the future have its hearings and hear ``there is no way we \ncan cut spending, and we cannot do this and we cannot cut that.''\n  Well, we have shown that, in a very fair way, we can do what is \nnecessary to get a balanced budget. So we have changed forever the \nprofligacy of a great Nation, and we ought to be proud of it and \nthankful for it.\n  To all the chairmen who worked so hard, thank you. I want to close \nand say to our leader, Senator Dole, thank you for all the confidence \nyou placed in me. When I had to get things done, you told me ``do \nthem.'' When I needed tough decisions and I could not get the votes, \nyou said, ``Bring them in my office.'' And last, I thank the \nbudgeteers. You have a tough job; you do not get to pass anything \nexcept this crazy resolution that cuts everything, but I thank you for \nyour unity and your support. It has been a privilege being your \nchairman. Thank you very much.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Democratic \nleader is recognized for a period of not to exceed 5 minutes.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I yield 2 minutes to the Senator from New \nJersey.\n  Mr. BRADLEY. Mr. President, this reconciliation bill, from top to \nbottom, is intoxicated with the fantasy that it is abandoning the \nwelfare state. Mr. President, we do not have a welfare state, we have a \nsafety net for a few poor people. This drives big holes in that safety \nnet. Welfare reform--block grants replace welfare. What it does is take \nmoney from Federal pols and give it to State pols. The theory is, if \nyou do not like Washington, you are going to love Lansing, or Trenton, \nor the State capital. Hardly. What this does is, in the Federal \ncommitment to poor children, 1.2 million more children will be plunged \ninto poverty because of this. The Medicaid block grant. Send it all \nback to the States. Do not say who is eligible, and do not say what the \nbenefits will be, or how the providers will provide the benefits. Just \nsend the money back.\n  The only thing we know is that when we pass this bill, 12 million \nAmericans will be uninsured. Uninsured. I predict that, 5 years from \nnow, there will be Medicaid scandals in States where Governors are \nputting in a health care program that will help their constituencies.\n  Why are State governments different? They are not. For what purpose? \nThe purpose is that we are giving a gigantic break to wealthy \nAmericans. On the other side, they say, ``Oh, no, only 35 percent of \nthe cut goes to people above $75,000.'' Yes, but they only represent 13 \npercent of the people. And embedded in this bill for estates of $2.5 \nmillion is an $800,000 tax cut. At the same time, we are ripping holes \nin the safety net, we are giving estates of $2.5 million an $800,000 \ntax cut. We should say ``no.''\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I want to commend the distinguished \nranking member for the excellent job he has done in representing our \ncaucus and commend all of the Members who have played a role in on our \nside, as we have debated this bill.\n  I believe that this is the most dangerous document in America. I \nbelieve it is one of the most extreme documents that we have had before \nthis Congress in the time that I have served here. When the lowest 20 \npercent of the people in this country lose more than all the other 80 \npercent combined, that is extreme. When the upper 20 percent gain more \nthan all the other 80 percent combined, that is extreme.\n  When you see the biggest shift in income from the middle class to the \ntop brackets in history--Mr. President, there is no other word to \ndescribe it but extreme. When it represents the biggest cut in health \ncare benefits in history, Mr. President, this document belongs in the \nGuinness Book of World Records.\n  The American people did not vote to see the kind of change this \ndocument represents. No one in this country voted to gut Medicare $270 \nbillion to provide tax breaks for those who do not need them. No one \nvoted to cut Medicaid $163 billion to provide tax breaks for those who \ndo not need them.\n  The distinguished Senator from New Mexico talked about protecting our \nchildren. How in Heaven's name do we protect our children when we cut \nthe legs out from under them in education, in student loans, in \nnutrition programs, in housing, in virtually every single area of \nopportunity this country has provided them--how do we do that? How in \nthe name of children can we stand up and support this document?\n  Mr. President, we can do better than this. The American people now by \nmore than a 2 to 1 margin believe--demand--we do better than this. The \nPresident will veto it, and he has good reason to veto it.\n  We need to sit down together and take the extreme measures out of \nthis document. We need to work to govern better. We need to send a \nbetter message to the American people.\n  We will not gut the investments in people that we have committed to \nfor a long, long time. The most dangerous document in America needs to \nbe vetoed and, indeed, it will be.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order the majority leader \nis recognized for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I think probably the most extreme thing that \nhas happened in the last 2 or 3 years is \n\n[[Page S 17329]]\nthe $265 billion tax increase passed by this Congress without a single \nRepublican vote. You talk about extremism--that is a good example, \nparticularly when the initiator confesses that he raised taxes too \nmuch, the President of the United States.\n  I believe we have a good package here. We have had a lot of work, and \nI want to thank, first of all, Senator Domenici and the entire Budget \nCommittee, but everyone else on this side of the aisle who have been \nworking the past several weeks to bring us to this moment.\n  I really believe, and I am sitting here thinking I have cast a lot of \nvotes in the U.S. Senate. I think this is probably the most important \none that I will cast, knowing it is not bipartisan. I would like to \nhave it bipartisan. But it is a very important vote. It is a \nfundamental change in America. It is a fundamental change in direction \nin this country. I think it is probably the most important vote I have \ncast in my years in the Senate.\n  I have never been so certain that we are doing something right--yes, \nright--for our children, as the Senator from New Mexico pointed out, \nfor our grandchildren, and for everybody else.\n  It is right for States. Yes, we are giving some power back to the \nGovernors. We are following the admonition of the 10th amendment of the \nConstitution, part of the Bill of Rights, 28 words in length, that \nsays, in effect, if the power is not reserved to the Federal Government \nit belongs to the States and to the people. We believe when the people \ngave us a majority last November, they wanted us to give power back to \nthe States and back to the people.\n\n  This bill is right for senior citizens. We will save, preserve, and \nstrengthen Medicare. It will still grow at a rate of 6.4 percent. We \nbelieve that is a step in the right direction.\n  But looking at other beneficiaries, somebody who buys a home will \nsave a lot of money because interest rates will come down. If you buy a \ncar, if you are going to buy farm machinery, if you take out a loan to \nsend your child to college, or if you are trapped in a failed welfare \nsystem--not anyone in this body would say we do not have a failed \nwelfare system.\n  It seems to me that if we are going to promise to end business as \nusual, we have to start putting up or shutting up. We cannot do all of \nthe things that my colleagues on the other side say--keep spending more \nmoney, spending more money, more taxes, more regulations, more \ngovernment--and ever make a fundamental shift in America.\n  I hope, again, knowing the bill is going to be vetoed, but I hope the \nAmerican people know that we are not going to mortgage their future \nwith this bill; that we are going to cut taxes for families with \nchildren; we are going to encourage savings and investment and economic \ngrowth. We have kept our promise. We kept our promise to shift power \nout of Washington, DC, to the States, and we have kept our promise \nthere.\n  I just conclude, because I know there are some of us going to another \ndebate, and some are getting nervous, which is all right with me, but I \nsimply ask the President of the United States to take another look at \nthis product. This is a good product, Mr. President. You ought to sign \nit. You ought to make up for all the things you have done wrong in the \npast 3 years and sign this bill. Then you would be right on target \nagain. You would be that new Democrat you wanted to be or thought you \nwere or might have been.\n  Mr. President, we are doing the right thing. We are doing it because \nwe stuck together, because we kept our promise, and because we love \nAmerica.\n  Mr. President, soon after my election to the Kansas State House of \nRepresentatives, a reporter asked me whether I had a legislative \nagenda. And I replied that my agenda was simple--it was to stand up for \nwhat I thought was right.\n  And I have tried to follow that philosophy throughout my career.\n  In just a few minutes I will vote to approve the Balanced Budget Act \nof 1995.\n  I believe the vote is one of the most historic votes ever taken in \nthis Chamber--and certainly the most important one I have cast in my \nyears in the Senate.\n  And as I cast my vote to approve this landmark legislation, I can say \nthat I have never been so certain that I am standing up for what's \nright.\n  I have never been so certain that the U.S. Senate is standing up for \nwhat is right.\n  Mr. President, the Balanced Budget Amendment Act of 1995 is right for \nAmerica's future.\n  It is right for the American people.\n  It is right for our children and grandchildren.\n  It is right for our States, our cities, and our neighborhoods.\n  It is right for our senior citizens.\n  It is right for every American who is saving to buy a home.\n  It is right for every American who is buying a car.\n  It is right for every American who takes out a loan to send a child \nto college.\n  It is right for those trapped in our failed welfare system.\n  Mr. President, last fall, Republicans asked voters to give us a \nmajority on Capitol Hill. And we left absolutely no doubt about what we \nwould do if we got that majority.\n  We promised we would put an end to business as usual. Tonight, \nAmericans know that we have kept our promise.\n  We promised to stop the mortgaging of our children's and \ngrandchildren's future, and to put America on a path to a balanced \nbudget. Tonight, Americans know that we have kept our promise.\n  We promised to replace our failed welfare system with one based on \nthe principles of work, family, and personal responsibility. Tonight, \nAmericans know that we have kept our promise.\n  We promised to cut taxes for America's families, and to encourage \nsavings, investment, and economic growth. Tonight, Americans know that \nwe have kept our promise.\n  We promised to shift power out of Washington, DC, and to return it to \nwhere it belongs--our States, our cities, and our people. And tonight \nAmericans know that we have kept our promise.\n  A balanced budget. True welfare reform. Lower taxes. More freedom and \npower for our States, our cities, and our people. That's what \nRepublicans are all about. And that's what this bill is all about.\n  President Clinton has said that he will veto this bill. He will, as \nis his habit, stand in the way of change. And I would simply say to the \nPresident to take another look at this bill.\n  We are told that the President's pollsters are advising him that the \nAmerican people have concluded that his actions don't match his words. \nBy signing this bill, President Clinton would prove that his actions do \nmatch his words on a number of issues.\n  President Clinton has told the American people many, many times that \nhe is for a balanced budget.\n  He said on June 4, 1992 he would balance the budget in 5 years.\n  He said on May 20, 1995, he could balance the budget in less than 10 \nyears.\n  He said on June 13, 1995, he would take 10 years.\n  And on October 19, 1995 he said he could balance it in either 7 \nyears, 8 years, or 9 years.\n  Despite these claims, President Clinton did everything he could to \ndefeat a balanced budget amendment, and the Congressional Budget \nOffice-- which the President has previously endorsed as an honest \nscorekeeper--has said that the budgets the President did propose left \nus with $200 million in deficits far into the next century.\n  President Clinton said in 1992 that he would end welfare as we know \nit. Yet, he admitted recently that the only welfare bill he proposed \nwas a disappointment.\n  The President promised in 1992 that he would give middle-class \nAmericans a tax cut. Yet, in 1993 he gave America the largest tax \nincrease in history.\n  The President said that he wants to prevent Medicare from going \nbankrupt, as three of his Cabinet members have projected it will do \nwithin 7 years. Yet, he has refused to work in a bi-partisan manner \nwith Republicans to save Medicare. Instead, according to a remarkable \neditorial in the Washington Post, the President has ``shamelessly used \nthe Medicare issue * * * demagogued on it * * * and taken to the \nairwaves with a slick scare program.''\n  So, Americans have every reason to be confused. Just where does the \nPresident stand on balancing the budget? Where does he stand on \nreforming welfare? Where does he stand on cutting \n\n[[Page S 17330]]\ntaxes for America's families? Where does he stand on saving Medicare?\n  The President's decision on this bill will, once and for all, clear \nup all confusion. Because by signing this bill, the President will \nfinally allow his actions to match his words. But by vetoing it, he \nwill make very clear that he is against a balanced budget, and the \nbenefits it will bring. He is against welfare reform. He is against tax \nreduction. He is against saving Medicare.\n  And by vetoing this bill, the President will be against many other \nprovisions. He will be against a capital gains tax cut. He will be \nagainst putting an end to the marriage penalty tax. He will be against \nmedical savings accounts. He will be against adoption tax credits. He \nwill be against helping Americans who provide care to their parents.\n  Now, when President Clinton vetoes this bill, he will shake his head, \nand he will say what many of his liberal allies have said today. He \nwill say that he would like to sign this bill, but it's just too harsh. \nHe will say that we are cutting spending on programs for the less \nfortunate among us. He will say we are cutting Medicare. He will say \nour tax cuts favor the business community.\n  He will say all that again and again. And he will be wrong every time \nhe says it.\n  He will be wrong because this bill does not cut overall Federal \nspending--it allows it to grow by 22 percent over the next 7 years.\n  He will be wrong because this bill does not cut Medicare. In fact, \nMedicare will continue to grow at a rate of 7.7 percent a year.\n  He will be wrong because this bill does not cut programs to the \nneedy--it allows 34 percent growth over the next 7 years.\n  He will be wrong because total funding for student loans will be \nincreased by nearly 50 percent over the next 7 years.\n  He will be wrong because 73 percent of the tax cuts in this bill will \nhelp families throughout their lives.\n  Those are the facts. The President will try his best to obscure these \nfacts with emotional rhetoric. In fact, the Democrat National Committee \nalready has a television commercial on the air trumpeting the \nPresident's so-called balanced budget proposal, and saying that the \nRepublican plan will cut Medicare.\n  It's a nice commercial with catchy music, but not a word of it is \ntrue. As I have said, the President has never submitted a budget \nanywhere near balance. And the Republican plan increases Medicare \nspending.\n  Mr. President, I'm from a farm State, and I want to say to the \nfarmers of Kansas and the farmers of America that this bill is also \nimportant to them.\n  Since the days of Franklin Roosevelt, the Government has been in the \nbusiness of telling farmers how to farm. Under this bill, that will \nend, and beginning in 1996, farmers will be planting for the market \nplace.\n  Under this bill, farmers will have full planting flexibility, \nelimination of set-asides, program simplicity, and a farm policy that \ntransitions farmers into the next century without disrupting the farm \neconomy or land values.\n  While I am concerned about farmers receiving payments in good years, \nI am pleased we were able to cap the entitlement spending of \nagriculture programs. We accomplish this goal through a declining \ntransition payment which is guaranteed to the farmer. In exchange, \nfarmers will be required to maintain their land conservation efforts in \nboth good and bad years. And this bill also protects family farms by \nproviding some much needed estate tax relief.\n  Mr. President, let me conclude by saying that I know that the \nAmerican people have wondered about the events taking place in \nWashington this week. They have wondered why the Government was shut \ndown. They have wondered why Congress and the White House aren't \ntalking to each other.\n  Well, as I have said many times this week, I wonder why we haven't \nspent more time talking to each other. And I remain ready to talk with \nthe President any time to put all Federal employees back to work.\n  But I also would tell Americans that if ever there was a debate you \nwanted your elected Representatives to have, this is it. This is it. \nBecause we are debating your future. We are debating the future of your \nchildren and grandchildren. We are debating the future of America.\n  I speak for all Republicans in saying that, as we approach \nThanksgiving, we are thankful to have the opportunity to stand for \nsomething.\n  We are thankful to have the opportunity to stand for fundamental \nchange.\n  We are thankful to have the opportunity to stand for a better future \nfor the next generation of Americans.\n  And let me close by saying--and I know I speak for all Members of the \nSenate--that we are thankful that we have the opportunity to serve with \na Senator as courageous and committed as Pete Domenici, and I salute \nhim for his many years of leadership in support of a balanced budget.\n  Mr. President, let's do the right thing for America's future. Let's \npass the Balanced Budget Act of 1995.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader is informed the yeas and \nnays have not been ordered.\n  Mr. DOLE.

Are we \ngoing to be voting on a motion to waive the point of order and will \nthat require 60 votes, Mr. President?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The vote does require 60 votes. Who yields \ntime?\n  Mr. EXON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, I yield myself 5 minutes off the time that I \nhave under my control, and will the Chair advise me how much time the \nSenator from Nebraska controls?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska controls 30 minutes.\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, I have been fascinated and horrified by the \npress reports about the horse trading that went on to win the support \nfor the Republican budget. I am not speaking about wooing recalcitrant \nRepublicans who strayed from the party line. No, I am looking at some \nof the sweeteners that were loaded into this bill to keep the medical \nestablishment at bay and to pay the American Medical Association for \ntheir support of the Republican budget.\n  This conference report is groaning with extraneous giveaways to the \nmedical establishment. They do not only violate the Byrd rule, but they \nviolate every sense of decency and fair play. The conference report \nexempts physicians' offices and laboratories from the Clinical \nLaboratory and Improvement Act of 1988.\n  It is clear that this is a violation of the Budget Act. It is \nextraneous, in addition to being bad policy. Antitrust regulations are \nturned on their heads in this conference report just to boost \nphysicians' salaries. The conference report exempts certain groups of \nhealth care providers from the most basic antitrust violations against \nprice fixing. This is also a violation of the Budget Act and is likely \nto impair competition and raise costs for non-Medicare health care \npurchasers.\n  It is appalling that when our seniors, our poor, our disabled, and \nour children are being asked to sacrifice basic health care, the \nRepublicans are trying to enlarge special interest giveaways to the \nNation's physicians.\n  The provisions do not belong in this fast-track reconciliation bill \nand are a violation of the Byrd rule. I urge my colleagues to vote \nagainst the motion to waive this well-founded point of order.\n  Madam President, at this time, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Hutchison). Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. EXON. Madam President, I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. EXON. Madam President, since there are no other Members seeking \nrecognition at this time, I yield 5 minutes of my time to the Senator \nfrom Arkansas.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Madam President, it is not unusual when I go home and \nvisit with some of my wealthy friends--and I do have some wealthy \nfriends--they say, ``The only objection I have to you Democrats is you \nare constantly engaging in class warfare. You are always talking about \nthe wealthy.''\n  I repudiate that idea, but I would like for my colleagues to look at \nthis chart for just a minute. This is a quote from David Gergen--one of \nRonald Reagan's right-hand men when he was President--from an op-ed \npiece that he wrote in this week's U.S. News and World Report. Without \nstraining your eyes, I will tell you what he said about this bill we \nare debating tonight. Eighty percent of the tax breaks in this bill go \nto the wealthiest 20 percent of Americans. Eighty percent of the \nspending cut burden goes to the poorest 20 percent. Now, you talk about \nclass warfare. There is class warfare. It violates every principle I \never learned as a Methodist Sunday school boy. It violates every \nprinciple I have ever held dear, and the very reason I came to the U.S. \nSenate. Madam President, let me say something about the wealthy people \nof this country. They do not like this. Seventy percent of the people \nof this country say they do not want a tax cut until the budget is \nbalanced. Why are we going against what 70 percent of the people say?\n  Last fall, when people were voting, Madam President, most did not \nhave a clue what was in the Contract With America. And I can assure you \nthey were not voting for this. They were not voting to penalize the \npoorest 20 percent of the people in America. They were not in favor of \ndepriving a million children in this country of an education. They were \nnot voting to put another million people in poverty, which this bill \ndoes. They were not voting to cut school lunches, which is the only \ndecent meal an awful lot of children in this country get. They were not \nvoting to savage Medicare and make the elderly people of this country \npay it. They were not voting to savage Medicaid. In my State, Medicaid \nwill be cut 33 percent, Madam President. We will not have a Medicaid \nprogram.\n  The people of America were not voting to slash the Earned Income Tax \nCredit for people who are trying to work and stay off welfare. What are \nwe doing? We are cutting that $32 billion.\n  So I remind my colleagues on the other side of the aisle, when the \nAmerican family gathers around the dinner table in the evening, what do \nthey talk about? What do they say they love? Not the Mercedes in the \ndriveway. Not that posh office downtown or that magnificent farm out \nback. They love their children. That is who they want us to protect. \nWhat are we doing? We are savaging the children of this country. For \nwhat? So that the biggest corporations in America get a break. I yield \nthe floor.\n  Mr. HATCH. Madam President, we are trying to accommodate Members \naround here. And there is no use kidding, I am very upset about this \npoint of order. This is not going to be the last time we mention it \neither. But I want to accommodate everybody around here. We ought to \nhave at least a 2-hour debate on the thing because it is not easy to \nexplain, but it is easy to understand. I have to tell you that I think \neven my colleagues on the other side might understand. But the fact of \nthe matter is that this point of order is wrong. I personally feel very \nbadly about it because what we are doing here is we are allowing the \nrule of reason in some areas and not allowing it in others. It is very \nunfair, it does not work right. We are happy to enhance bureaucracy but \nwe are not happy to enhance individuality. I think we can clarify it \nfor anybody in just a few minutes. But we want to accommodate those who \nwant to get out of here and, frankly, I think we can put a lot of what \nwe have to say into the Record.\n  Let me address this point of order against antitrust rules relating \nto provider-sponsored organizations--PSO's, if you will--and health \ncare groups \n\n[[Page S 17317]]\nthat contract with them to provide Medicare services. These provisions \nwould grant antitrust relief to these two different entities by \nsubjecting their conduct to the rule of reason, rather than the per se \nillegal rule.\n  Let me be clear about what this language would do. This is not an \nantitrust exemption. Under the rule of reason, the conduct of the PSO's \nand their subcontracting health care groups will not be legal if it is \ndesigned to fix prices, divide markets, or exclude competitors. \nInstead, their conduct will be illegal if it is anticompetitive, but if \nit is competitive, leads to efficiency, and produces lower prices for \nhealth care, it will survive antitrust challenge, as it should.\n  This provision that we are about to strike out of here is one of the \nfew that really saves an awful lot of money in health care and flies in \nthe face of bureaucratizing the process, which I thought we defeated \nlast year. We believe that this reform--which is necessary only because \nthe Department of Justice and the Federal Trade Commission have \noverzealously enforced the antitrust laws--is central to the savings we \nanticipate in our Medicare reforms. Right now, because of these \nenforcement policies, groups of doctors cannot form, decide on a fee \nschedule, and negotiate with anyone over providing health care \nservices, if this is knocked out. This knocks out of the market a \npotentially new class of competitors with low overhead and little or no \nbureaucracy, who can make these other groups bring prices down.\n  The Congressional Budget Office scored the savings to be generated by \nthe House and Senate Medicare reform bills at between $34.2 billion and \n$50.4 billion over 7 years.\n  CBO did not break out how much of this savings was attributable to \nthe creation of health care provider groups that could contract with \nPSO's, and the importance of the antitrust reform needed to encourage \nthe groups to form. The CBO noted the creation of PSO's in these groups \nwould have an impact on Medicare outlays and that is all that is needed \nto meet the express language of the Byrd rule.\n  Further, since this bill is creating two whole new classes of \ncompetitors in the Medicare market, and the antitrust provisions are \ncritical to encouraging their formation, it is clear that these \nprovisions are critical to producing the billions of dollars in savings \nwe are counting on for innovation and competition. I do not think that \nanyone can seriously contend that these provisions have no budgetary \nimpact.\n  The second argument that one might raise against these provisions is \nthat they are somehow incidental to reconciliation. This aspect of the \nByrd rule is designed to prevent the addition of provisions that have \nnothing to do with the budget. The antitrust provisions clearly satisfy \nthe Byrd rule. The rule has nothing to do with the larger changes in \nall antitrust law.\n  In fact, it does not change antitrust law at all, only the \nadministration's enforcement. More importantly, the antitrust \nprovisions are expressly limited only to conduct that is necessary to \nprovide health care services under Medicare contract or plan. It has no \napplication outside of the Medicare context, and any attempt to use \ninformation gained in Medicare context beyond the limits of that \nprogram--what some people call a leakage or seepage problem--would be \nillegal. Any conduct occurring in the Medicare context that is just a \nsham for price fixing or boycotting would still be illegal under the \nrule of reason.\n  I suggest that those who would use the Byrd rule to stop these \nprovisions are not concerned, Madam President, about budgetary impact \nor incidental provisions. Instead, they are interested in suppressing \ncompetition in the health care market and reducing Medicare costs.\n  We should be frank. The status quo helps large hospitals and \ninsurance companies and HMO's. These antitrust provisions that are in \nthis bill that they are trying to rule out of order may cut down on \ntheir profit margins by introducing whole new classes of health care \nproviders into the marketplace. New market actors will spur competition \nefficiency and lower costs.\n  When we are fighting to find ways to reduce Government costs and the \nGovernment's tax burden, why turn away an attractive mechanism to make \nthe markets work better and to reduce the budget?\n\n  The fact is per se illegal activity will still be illegal. These \nentities would have to live within the rule of reason. If they do not \nand they do not increase competition, increase efficiency, and reduce \ncosts, then they are not going to be able to function, and they should \nnot be.\n  The fact of the matter is that this point of order is wrong, and I \nhope that we will vote to waive the point of order.\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, I yield 3 minutes to the Senator from \nFlorida.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Thank you, Madam President.\n  As I read the front cover of the document which has just been \npresented to us, Balanced Budget Act of 1995, Part 1 of 2--Part 2 \napparently has not yet arrived--the question arises, why will I vote \nagainst this proposition?\n  It is not, Madam President, because I am opposed to a balanced \nbudget. I am, in fact, strongly supportive of a balanced budget, and \nevery occasion I have had an opportunity to advance that cause I have \ndone so.\n  I frankly commend the Republicans for having presented us an \nalternative which purports to achieve that goal of balanced budget \nbecause it will provide a significant point of debate and dialog as to \nhow to achieve that goal.\n  However, Madam President, I do not feel that this legislation \npresented tonight will accomplish the objective of balanced budget for \ntwo primary reasons. One, just as in foreign policy, I do not believe \nthis Nation can achieve an important long-term domestic policy goal \nunless that goal is broadly shared, unless there is bipartisan support.\n  The fact is, there is no bipartisan support for this provision. There \nhas been no attempt to secure bipartisan support. No Democrats were \nsanctioned into the conferences which led to the production of this \nlegislation. No Democratic ideas were solicited for inclusion.\n  Second, this will not achieve the goal of a balanced budget over the \nnext 7 years because it is fundamentally unfair and will soon be seen \nto be unfair by the American people and rejected.\n  I am going to concentrate my comments on fairness on only one section \nof this multihundred-page bill, Part 1 of 2, goes to 966 pages. That is \nthe sections that relate to Medicaid.\n  First, the statement is made that this legislation reduces Medicaid \nspending by $163 billion over the next 7 years. Madam President, that \nis not true. In fact, this legislation reduces Medicaid spending by \nalmost $400 billion over the next 7 years.\n  What is the difference? The difference is because this legislation \nremoves virtually all of the current requirements on States to make a \nsignificant contribution towards the health of their poor, their \ndisabled and their frail elderly.\n  Second, this allows for future manipulation of the Medicaid Program. \nWe worked hard in this Senate to eliminate the abuses that had become \nso rampant in the disproportionate share hospital program. This \nlegislation allows all those abuses to return. This legislation, in \nfact, rewards those very States that have been the principal abusers of \nthe disproportionate share program.\n  Madam President, for those and many other reasons that we will find \nin these 966 pages, this proposal fails to meet the duel test of \nbipartisanship and fairness necessary for its sustained achievement of \nthe goal of the balanced budget.\n  Madam President, we are here debating a bill that nobody has \nreceived. Even for those who may have a copy, it would be impossible \nfor them to have possibly read the legislation from cover to cover.\n  And yet, this is one of the most significant bills to come before the \nCongress. This is a bill that makes up to $1 trillion in reductions to \nour Nation's budget--including $256 billion in Medicare reductions and \n$163.5 billion in Medicaid reductions--over the next 7 years.\n  I rise today to speak to the best of my knowledge about some of the \nprovisions in this bill. Of course, the ``best of my knowledge'' is \nlimited by the amount of information we have managed to obtain, some of \nwhich our office has had to get from lobbyists who always seem to get \nsuch materials before the rest of the Congress.\n\n[[Page S 17318]]\n\n  Due to time limitations, I will focus on the massive reductions or \n$420 billion in Federal cuts that will be made in this bill to our \nNation's Medicare and Medicaid programs which are integral parts of our \nNation's health infrastructure.\n\n\n       medicaid cuts even higher due to state-federal combination\n\n  The first point that has been neglected about this budget deal are \nthat the real Medicaid reductions are more in the neighborhood of $400 \nbillion over the next 7 years. Part of this figure comes from the \n$163.5 billion in Federal reductions to Medicaid. However, an often \noverlooked but just as significant provision is the language in the \nbill that guts the matching rate requirements of States.\n  This reduction will have the effect of reducing another $200-plus \nbillion in State funding over the next 7 years to the Medicaid program.\n  How does this work? At present, States such as New York have to match \na Federal Medicaid dollar with a State Medicaid dollar. No longer. \nAccording to the revised State matching requirements, New York would be \nallowed to match a Federal Medicaid dollar with just 67 cents--a 33-\npercent reduction.\n  The effect of the change to the matching rates across the Nation will \nbe a $200-plus billion reduction in State funding to Medicaid.\n  Moreover, the conference agreement eliminates two provisions in the \nSenate bill that were agreed to unanimously in the Senate Finance \nCommittee. These amendments would have continued to prohibit the gaming \nof the Medicaid System through the use of provider taxes and prohibited \nStates from supplanting current State health expenditures with Medicaid \ndollars.\n  The conference committee agreement encourages States to go back to \nthe days of fictitious accounting and gaming that in the past \neffectively raided the Medicaid Program.\n  The effect of this policy under a block grant is not to raid the \nFederal treasury but to make the State matching rate illusory at best. \nIn fact, the conference report effectively makes Medicaid a general \nrevenue sharing program.\n  It is no wonder that some of our Nation's Governors are clamoring and \ncheerleading the destruction of the Medicaid Program. I have a warning \nfor them, or more accurately, a proverb for them. The proverb goes as \nfollows: ``Fish see the worm not the hook.''\n  The Governors who are anxious to gobble up these block grants and \nillusory matching rates will feel took in the future when their \neconomies stumble, when an epidemic strikes, when a nature disaster \nhits, when inflation creeps up again, or when their populations grow.\n\n\n                  Nation's Low-Income Elderly At Risk\n\n  Another often misunderstood provision of this legislation is the \nimpact that it will have on our Nation's low-income elderly.\n  Let me emphasize that the Republican bill repeals the current law \nguarantee of payment of the Medicare Part B premiums on behalf of \nelderly Americans with income below the poverty level--$622 per month \nfor an individual.\n  Although the Speaker of the House claims the bill ``provides that \nsenior citizens at the poverty level and below have all of their Part B \npremium paid for by the taxpayers--100 percent,'' the fact is that, no \npoor senior citizen has a guarantee to any coverage or assistance \nwhatsoever.\n  States would be asked to set aside a certain percentage of their \nprogram spending each year to pay for Medicare premiums, deductibles, \nand coinsurance on behalf of low-income elderly. However, this set-\naside will be sufficient to cover only about 44 percent of the costs of \nPart B premiums for those now eligible by the year 2002.\n\n\n                  Nursing Home--Liens of Family Homes\n\n  Another provision that was unanimously agreed to in the Senate \nFinance Committee was a provision that protected spouses having liens \nplaced against their home or family farm. Incredibly, this provision \nwas also dropped by the conference committee.\n  As a result, the conference agreement repeals current law protections \nagainst the use of liens and expressly authorizes States to impose \nliens on the home or family farm of a beneficiary, even when the spouse \nis still living in it.\n\n\n                unfairness of medicaid cuts and formula\n\n  Finally, I want to raise some policy questions that the bill creates. \nFirst what is the policy justification for $163.5 billion in Medicaid \nreductions? This provides for just a 1.9 percent increase in Medicaid \nspending per person over the seven year period and is far less than the \n7.1 percent the Congressional Budget Office projects private sector \nspending to increase.\n  Second, what is the policy justification for arriving at the Medicaid \nformula in the bill? Can anybody possibly explain how the fiscal year \n1996 State-by-State allocations are arrived at? Dollar figures are \nstated in law. How were those numbers arrived at?\n  Clearly, one impact is to reward those States that have extremely \nhigh share of disproportionate share in the past. Some of those States \nabused the Medicaid Program and will be rewarded for that abuse in the \nnew Medicaid formula.\n  At one point, the Senate Finance Committee staff had proposed that \nStates with excessive disproportionate share payments would lose those \nexcess payments. The Senate Finance Committee voted to cap those \npayments at 12 percent.\n  That provision was deleted, and instead, States are now rewarded for \ntheir excesses and--in some cases--their abuse.\n  These States will have those funds permanently cemented in their base \nallocation and allowed to increase them well into the future. What is \nthe policy rationale for this?\n  Whatever the rationale, the effect is to apportion funding in a \nmanner that is fundamentally unfair to those States that did not scam \nthe Medicaid disproportionate share program, those States that are \ngrowing and those States that have been efficient in the past.\n  In Florida's case, we have a larger population than either \nPennsylvania and Ohio and an elderly population that is 40.7 percent \ngreater than Pennsylvania and 79.2 percent greater than Ohio, yet will \nreceive less money over the next 7 years from Medicaid than either of \nthose two States.\n  Florida has 5.4 percent of the Nation's population, 8 percent of the \nNation's elderly population but will receive just 4.2 percent of the \noverall Federal Medicaid allocation between fiscal year 1996 and 2002.\n  If Florida were to just receive its population share of money, it \nwould receive $42.7 billion instead of the $33.0 billion allowed in \nthis bill, a $9.7 billion disparity or loss to Florida over the 7-year \nperiod.\n\n\n                             other problems\n\n  For all these reasons and for numerous others--such as the conference \ncommittee's level of Medicare cuts on our Nation's elderly and the \ndanger and exposure that Medicare beneficiaries will be subjected to \ndue to watered down emergency care managed care standards, I cannot and \nwill not support this legislation.\n  I would like to turn the Senate's attention from Medicaid and \nMedicare for a moment to another important issue before the Senate \ntonight.\n  Madam President, when the Senate votes on the reconciliation bill \nshortly, there will be one important issue which risks being lost in \nthe enormity of the Medicare cutting, Medicaid gutting, tax cutting, \nand budget balancing package.\n  That issue is welfare reform.\n  The effrontery of burying such a monumentally important matter in the \nmiddle of a massive Medicare, Medicaid, Tax Code, and budget overhaul \nspeaks for itself.\n  The welfare reform component of this reconciliation bill deserves \nstrict scrutiny instead of token consideration.\n  My support for sweeping change in our Nation's welfare system is a \nmatter of record, and as recently as September 19, 1995, I joined with \n86 of my colleagues in supporting the Work Opportunity Act of 1995, \nSenate bill 1120.\n  I voted in support of this bill, even though I had serious \nreservations, in order to keep the welfare reform effort in this \nCongress alive.\n  Unfortunately, the conference agreement moves welfare reform in the \nopposite direction. The pending legislation is worse than what we had \nto consider 2 months ago.\n  Madam President, I support welfare reform. I want to see Congress \npass a welfare reform measure, and I want to \n\n[[Page S 17319]]\nsee the President sign welfare reform legislation. But this bill \ndeserves neither.\n  Welfare reform, when it is done well, works and works well.\n  Florida boasts of two very successful welfare pilot projects, the \nlargest in America in instituting a ``time limited benefit.'' Florida, \nin fact, has been one of the pioneers in the ``two years and you are \nout'' approach that is mirrored in the pending legislation.\n  But, Madam President, these pilots are succeeding because there is a \nfront-end investment in the lives of those affected by the program \nchange.\n  Whether it is day care, job training, temporary transportation \nassistance, or health care, the welfare recipient is given a hand up \ninstead of a hand out.\n  I visited the program in Pensacola, FL. Earlier this year President \nClinton met some of the participants that I met, and he touted the \nprogram.\n  Madam President, the conference agreement before the Senate, as it \npertains to welfare reform, is a mixture of good news and bad news.\n  The good news is that the conference agreement no longer treat \neducation as welfare. We have Congressman Clay Shaw and others to thank \nfor that improvement.\n  Thankfully, the welfare reform legislation no longer kicks legal \nimmigrants who pay taxes and are eligible for Federal student loans or \ngrants, out of school.\n  This change assures 21,000 students in universities, colleges, and \ncommunity colleges in Florida that they can continue to study and train \nin order to provide for their families and enhance our Nation's \nproductivity.\n  Further, the conference agreement renounces the previous position of \nthe Senate where deeming would occur past the date of citizenship. That \nprovision appeared unconstitutional on its face, and fortunately, it \nwas dropped.\n  But, Madam President, I am sorry to report that there is an \noverwhelming amount of bad news emerging from the conference on welfare \nreform.\n  First, the formula to allocate funds to the States continues welfare \nas we knew it. It treats poor children differently, depending upon \nwhich State they live in.\n\n  The conference formula says that if your State spent a lot in the old \ndays, and thus built incentives to keep people on welfare, you will be \ngiven a leg up on every other State under block grants.\n  That is how it is possible, for example, that the State of Michigan \nwould be given $217 million more, each year, than the State of Florida, \nwhich has a population that is 4.5 million greater than Michigan's \npopulation.\n  The conclusion is simple: the formula adopted by the conferees is \nflawed, if not rigged.\n  The conferees had an option: adopt a fair share allocation which \ntreats children the same regardless of their ZIP codes. I offered such \nan amendment 2 months ago.\n  Instead, the conferees chose to reward the big spenders who got us in \nthis mess in the first place.\n  If parents rewarded bad behavior of their children like this, we \nwould be a nation of reform schools.\n  Madam President, another glaring disappointment in the conference \nagreement before the Senate is the retreat on a commitment to funding \nchild care.\n  The Senate voted for a $3 billion increase over 5 years and now we \nsee that the conference agreement proposes $3 billion over 7 years.\n  That may sound like an innocuous accounting change until you look at \nthe impact on the States.\n  That change means for Florida less child care money next year, I \nrepeat, less money next year, than it had this year.\n  Keep in mind that Florida is expected to more than double in one year \nits population of welfare recipients in the work force.\n  The conference agreement short-changes Florida $18 million in child \ncare funds from the amount that passed the Senate in September. That is \nmovement backward, not forward.\n  When you take the faulty funding formula for the block grants, and \ncombine them with the paltry child care allocations, you get the \ngrowing sense that Florida has been set up to fail.\n  Madam President, it did not have to be this way. If government were \nrun like a business, you would have had by now a debate about a \nbusiness plan.\n  In effect, you would have identified outcomes to be achieved, and \nthen identified the means necessary to achieve those outcomes.\n  Just in the area of child care alone, in order to meet the job \nrequirements of the conference agreement for the first 5 years after \nenactment, Florida would need approximately $800 million in child care \nfunding. The conference agreement gives Florida $509 million.\n  That $291 million shortfall means that tens of thousands of children \ncan not get child care, and therefore, their mothers or fathers can't \ngo to work.\n  But the Congress wasn't interested in outcome and resource analysis. \nThe Congress didn't want to do a business plan.\n  The Congress wanted to cut tens of billions of dollars out of welfare \nand shift those burdens to the States.\n  I will highlight a few more disappointments.\n  The Senate placed $878 million in a growth fund to assist States \nwhich experience caseload increases, and thus, cost increases. The \nconference agreement reduces that about 10 percent.\n  I mentioned earlier that there was good news in the conference \nagreement as it pertains to legal immigrants and access to Federal \nassistance to higher educational programs.\n  But even that good news has a new catch. The conferees have set up a \nnew class system now in the Stafford loans program. Now legal immigrant \napplicants must have a sponsor or other citizen cosign the loans.\n\n  No debate on this change. No hearings. A brand new provision written \nin conference.\n  So I am left to believe that the conferees felt that only the better \noff of the legal immigrant communities are eligible for a Federal loan \nprogram, even though they all pay taxes like citizens pay taxes. So \nmuch for the American dream.\n  The city of Miami had more legal immigrants admitted last year than \n20 States combined did. Thus the prohibitions and timetables on certain \nbenefits will shift to Miami costs that once were shared or born by the \nFederal Government.\n  The State of Florida does not set immigration policy. The State of \nFlorida did not negotiate a 20,000 legal immigrants per year agreement \nbetween Cuba and the United States.\n  But the State of Florida is now being told the following: first, we \nare going to cheat you on the block grant, and give States like New \nYork more than four times what you get.\n  Second, we are going to cut child care for your State, and leave you \n$300 million below what you need to achieve the work participation \nrates that we intend to grade you on.\n  Finally, we are going to stick you with hundreds of millions of \ndollars in costs for legal and illegal immigration, even though you \nhave no control over those policies.\n  How is that for fairness? How is that for reasonableness?\n  Madam President, I am disappointed with the direction the welfare \nreform measure went after it left the Senate. It has taken a turn for \nthe worse. For the State of Florida, a State which did not have a high \nwelfare benefit check and thus did not contribute as greatly to the \nwelfare culture as those States who now reap windfalls for having \ncreated the problem, the conference agreement is not acceptable.\n  I urge the President to veto this bill and for both sides to begin to \nwork together immediately toward reaching a consensus plan on balancing \nthe Nation's budget. There is another way.\n  Mr. KYL. Madam President, let me get back to the issue before us, \nwhich is the objection to the point of order that has been made to \ncertain provisions of this bill.\n  Madam President, we ought not to waive this provision. We should not \nhave to waive the provision because there is nothing violative of the \nByrd rule in the antitrust provisions of the Medicare part of the \nBalanced Budget Act of 1995.\n  Let me go back a little bit to set the stage here. The whole theory \nof our Medicare reform, how we are beginning to strengthen Medicare and \nsave it from bankruptcy, is to create more choices in the marketplace \nso that competition will drive costs down while also ensuring quality \nof care.\n  Now, in order to create those choices, we allowed for the creation of \na couple \n\n[[Page S 17320]]\nof new products in this legislation. One of the products is the medical \nsavings account whereby people would have an incentive not to spend all \nof the deductible amount that they did not have to spend, and we \nprovided that tax free.\n  As a result of a Byrd problem on that provision, the inside buildup--\nthat is to say, the part that you do not spend--is now going to be \ntaxed.\n  One of the products is not going to be nearly as attractive as it was \nwhen we wrote our bill.\n  The other new product is the hospital and physician organization, a \nnew type of entity, somewhat similar to an HMO, but not really the same \nbecause here instead of having an insurance company or some kind of \nadministrative organization that runs the whole program you simply have \nphysicians and hospitals in a community getting together to offer their \nservices on a capitated basis for the people who would be eligible for \nMedicare benefits.\n  It is believed the creation of these organizations by cutting out the \nmiddleman and creating a new product would, in fact, create that kind \nof choice and therefore the competition in the marketplace would cause \ncosts to be reduced.\n  The two products, together, along with existing Medicare and the HMO \noption that currently exists would therefore create lower costs, thus \nallowing us to save the $270 billion over the 7 years that is needed in \norder to prevent the bankruptcy of the system.\n  Madam President, as I said, the medical savings account part of this \nis now jeopardized because of the Byrd rule. If we also cripple the \nphysician-hospital organizations because of the Byrd rule, we will have \nlargely failed to create the two new products and therefore the \ncompetition, the choice, and the competition in this, and I fear, Madam \nPresident, that our entire Medicare reform will fail. And the \ncommitment that we have made to our seniors, as a result of the \nDemocrats raising the objection here, will cause our Medicare reform to \nfail.\n\n  Madam President, I will say this as clearly as I can. If and when \nthat happens, the American people, and in particular the seniors of \nthis country, ought to know precisely where the blame lies. Because we \nhave an opportunity this evening to save the Medicare system. But if \npeople do not vote down this point of order, it is in serious jeopardy \nof going bankrupt because our system will not have within it the two \nkey products that would be created to create this competition and \nchoice.\n  What exactly happens here? Why are we so concerned about this? For \nthe doctors and the hospitals to get together to create this kind of \norganization, they have to talk to each other and they have to talk \nabout prices and how they are going to treat patients. When that \nhappens, lawyers are going to say, you are violating the antitrust \nlaws. Under a per se rule, which means ``in and of itself,'' that would \nbe true. The mere fact that you sit down and talk about it violates the \nlaw.\n  So we have said in here, let us substitute the rule of reason, a rule \nof antitrust law that says we will consider it under the circumstances. \nIf what they did is really wrong and violative of the antitrust laws, \nthen we are still going to prosecute them. But if, under the \ncircumstances of creating this new product, and only for the purpose of \ncontracting with Medicare, they get together and talk about these \nthings, things such as prices, then it would be OK. But the Justice \nDepartment, FTC, still would look at this under a rule of reason, as \nSenator Hatch pointed out.\n  There are two main points, and this is what I will close on. The CBO \nallegedly has not scored this--excuse me, has said it would have no \nbudgetary effect. That is not true. The CBO has never said that, so \nthat basis for a parliamentary ruling would simply be in error. Quite \nthe opposite is true with respect to the physician-hospital networks.\n  Second, the conclusion is that the antitrust provisions are merely \nincidental. In this regard, two contradictory arguments are made. One, \nthat this is such a big deal that all kinds of doctors are going to get \ntogether and fix prices and it is going to affect the market far beyond \nthe Medicare market. The other is that it is merely incidental.\n  Both cannot be true. The fact of the matter is, the antitrust \nprovisions are critical to the creation of this product. It is going to \nbe very hard for them to work without the antitrust exemption. So it is \nnot merely incidental. It is there for the sole purpose of enabling \nthese organizations to operate.\n  If they cannot operate, then the cost savings are not there because \nthey cannot compete in the marketplace, and our system is destined to \nfail. It is only for Medicare contracts.\n  Madam President, I will conclude it this way. If this provision comes \nout, if these antitrust modifications, just to the rule of reason, come \nout of the bill, then I am going to predict that this could easily \nfail. If it does, the people who vote against this this evening are the \nones who should be held responsible.\n  I hope that Democrats and Republicans alike will join us in defeating \nthis objection and in sustaining the waiver to the budget point of \norder.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I rise to support Senator Exxon's Point \nof Order that the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments [CLIA] \nrepealed in this budget reconciliation bill violates the Byrd Rule.\n  The Senate Parliamentarian has ruled that repealing CLIA violates the \nByrd Rule because it produces changes or outlays that are merely \nincidental to the nonbudgetary components of the provision. That is a \nviolation of the Byrd Rule.\n  Let me explain briefly to my colleagues what CLIA is, and why it is \nso important to me and to millions of Americans.\n  CLIA `88 set for the first time uniform quality standards for all \nclinical labs. I am proud that this law, which I authored, was passed \nwith broad bipartisan support.\n  CLIA was passed in 1988 and implemented in 1992 to address serious \nand life-threatening conditions in clinical labs.\n  To now even suggest we turn back the clock to pre-1988 will have \ndevastating results. Do we really want to:\n  Turn back to a time when tests were misread and diseases \nmisdiagnosed.\n  Turn back to the bad old days of misdiagnosis of the HIV/AIDS virus.\n  When doctors were using inferior methods of reading slides.\n  When people with the virus went undetected because the virus was \nmutating and was recognized by physicians.\n  Or turn back to a time when the lab technicians were overworked and \nundersupervised.\n  When slides were taken home.\n  When dirty labs were tolerated.\n  When lab technicians had little or no formal training, resulting in \nmany diseases going undetected.\n  My colleagues, CLIA works, CLIA saves lives. Reconciliation is not \nthe place to make such changes. I urge you to sustain this point of \norder.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, we are being asked to vote on the antitrust \nprovisions of this conference report. As I understand it, these \nprovisions would allow doctors to form Medicare provider networks--\nsimilar to existing managed care networks that are run by insurance \ncompanies--without running afoul of the per se standards of anti-trust \nlaw.\n  This provision violates the Byrd law. It is extraneous. It has no \neffect on the deficit, and therefore it does not belong in the budget \nreconciliation bill.\n  Furthermore, Madam President, this issue has just now been brought \nbefore the Senate. There was no similar provision in the Senate version \nof the reconciliation bill. There have not been hearings before the \nJudiciary Committee. And, we have not had a chance to examine the \neffects of this change in anti-trust law.\n  But, let me say that as ranking member of the Judiciary Committee, I \nwould be happy to give this matter full consideration. We should find \nout whether the change proposed here would really create more \ncompetition in the health care sector of the economy--and we should \nexamine whether this would be a benefit to rural areas of the country.\n  And, frankly, in this new health care climate, with the emphasis on \nbig insurance companies running managed care plans like HMO's, doctors \nneed some protection. I have told physicians in Delaware that I am \nwilling to help find ways to ensure that doctors can be doctors. I \nthink that if doctors ran the managed care networks, we might all be \nbetter off. If that means that we \n\n[[Page S 17321]]\nmust provide anti-trust relief, then I am willing to look closely at \nit.\n  But, I cannot support doing it here--doing it now--on a bill that is \nsupposed to reduce the deficit. Therefore, I will support stripping \nthis provision from the bill, and I will vote against the motion to \nwaive the rules for physician anti-trust relief.\n  I hope, however, that we will look at this more closely, in a more \nrational way, on another day.\n  Mr. EXON. I yield 8 minutes to the Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, the argument we have heard, \nunfortunately, is somewhat like the trial in ``Alice in Wonderland.'' \nFirst you have the sentence and then you have the trial afterward. In \nthis case--and this shows the very reason for the Byrd rule--we have \nspecial antitrust rules that are embedded in the reconciliation bill on \nbehalf of the doctors' lobby. They are significant matters. They \npropose changes in antitrust law, in the policy that competition \nprovides the best protection for consumers. I have said when you have \nthe sentence first and you have the trial after: You would think that \nif you were going to make these major antitrust rules changes--I do not \nknow, Madam President, if I am disturbing this conversation in front of \nme or not.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. LEAHY. It is a fascinating conversation, and I will probably \npause long enough to listen to it myself.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If the Senators will come to order, so we can \nhear the Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. As I was saying, we are being required to make these major \nantitrust changes without any proceedings, hearings or debate. We are \nbeing required to do it without any vote. All we hear from is, \napparently, the back room somewhere. Here some highly-paid lobby comes \nin and says, ``Whisper, whisper, whisper,'' and what comes out of that? \nWe end up with a special provision in a budget reconciliation bill. We \nhave a reconciliation bill and tucked in there are major changes in the \nantitrust law.\n  Mr. KYL. Will the Senator yield a moment?\n  Mr. LEAHY. I tried not to interrupt the Senator from Arizona before. \nLet me finish, and then I will be happy to yield for a question.\n  Mr. KYL. Thank you.\n  Mr. LEAHY. The Senate budget reconciliation bill that the Senate \npassed contained no such provision of which I am aware. The House \noriginally had two. Then they end up with one. An unnecessary and \ndangerous antitrust law change is in the conference report on budget \nreconciliation.\n  Again, I do not know where it came from. It did not come from \nhearings or debate, and it certainly did not come from any votes on the \nSenate floor. I am not aware that it came from any votes on the House \nfloor.\n  Yet in proposed new subsection (f), of proposed new section 1853 to \nthe Social Security Act, as contained in section 8001 of title 8 of the \nBudget Reconciliation Conference Report, in a special antitrust rule \nand change in our antitrust policy.\n  What it does is this: It exempts certain groups of doctors and other \nhealth care providers from the so-called per se rule against price \nfixing in our antitrust laws.\n  The conference report does omit the heading ``Special Antitrust Rule \nFor Provider Service Networks''--originally the House-passed bill \nactually had a heading and flagged the change --they took the heading \nout, but they left a rewrite of the section in. Maybe because this \nreconciliation bill is so long and filled with so many special interest \ngimmicks and gimmies and giveaways, maybe they thought that if you take \nthe headings off, people will not know they are there. But it is still \nthere as a subsection.\n  It attempts to enact a special antitrust rule for groups of health \ncare providers. It provides that the conduct of members of a group of \nhealth care providers, such as doctors, in ``negotiating, making, and \nperforming a contract--including the establishment and modification of \nfee schedule--'' with a provider-sponsored organization for services \nunder a MedicarePlus plan cannot be subject to the per se rule against \nprice fixing.\n  Basically, it says, go ahead and agree on whatever you want because \nwe will make it harder for anyone to prove that you are violating the \nantitrust laws. You are on your own.\n  Instead of the per se rule that is usually applied to stop price \nfixing, the only antitrust rule that can be applied is to consider and \ntest the conduct based on its ``reasonableness, taking into account all \nrelevant factors affecting competition, in properly defined markets''.\n  This is changing one of the most basic rules of antitrust law, \nchanging it in a little special gimmie or giveaway provision, tucked in \nthe reconciliation bill for whatever special interest wrote it. It \nchanges the rule from the one that applies to competitors throughout \nthe rest of the economy and that works to protect competition and \nconsumers.\n  The antitrust law treats a very limited category of conduct as per se \nunlawful. That is reserved for naked restraints, that is, those that \nare inherently harmful to competition without conferring offsetting \nbenefits. The classic example, Madam President, I say to my colleagues, \nis an agreement among competitors to fix the price of the products or \nservices they sell when the agreement is not reasonably necessary to \nthe operation of an efficiency-enhancing joint venture.\n  In fact, seeing my friend from Arizona on the floor, I would refer to \nthe Supreme Court decision Arizona v. Maricopa County Medical Society, \n457 U.S. 332 (1982). In that case, the Supreme Court held that a group \nof competing doctors who agreed on the maximum price at which they \nwould sell their services to insurers without substantially \nintegrating, that is, without becoming partners or joint venturers that \nshare financial risk, was engaged in per se illegal price fixing.\n  Madam President, I am advised the leadership would like to make an \nunanimous consent request, and I yield for that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n\n\n                      Unanimous-Consent Agreement\n\n  Mr. KYL. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator \nDomenici have 30 seconds to close, and the Senate then proceed to vote \non the motion to waive without further action or debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. LEAHY. Reserving the right to object, 30 seconds to close after I \nfinish or right now?\n  Mr. KYL. Right now.\n  I am sorry----\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I understand Senator Leahy was going to complete his \nspeech and then that would take place.\n  Mr. KYL. At the conclusion of his remarks.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Instead of giving the full amount, I will take about \nanother half minute, and then I have no objection. I enjoy hearing----\n  Mr. KYL. I amend the unanimous consent request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If the Senator from Arizona would finish his \nrequest?\n  Mr. KYL. The request is that at the conclusion of Senator Leahy's \nremarks, Senator Domenici have 30 seconds to close and we then proceed \nwithout any further debate to a vote on the motion to waive.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Madam President, I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, I understand Members may be trying to \nrestate the question by the Senator from Arizona. I will assure the \nSenator from Arizona and the Democratic leader that when they are \ngetting close to that I will yield immediately for them to make the \nrequest again.\n  Basically the point is a very serious point. I do not want to make \nmotions on this or other reconciliation bills. I do so only \nreluctantly. But this is such a major change in the antitrust law to be \ntucked in here absent hearings, absent debate, and absent votes. I \nthink is wrong.\n  For those Members of the Senate who are here, when we talked about \nthe Byrd rule in the first place, it was specifically for this. We are \ntalking about a reconciliation bill that goes past the normal debate \nrules of the Senate. I see the distinguished senior Senator from West \nVirginia on the floor. I think he would be the first to agree regarding \nthis reconciliation. \n\n[[Page S 17322]]\n\n  The budget reconciliation conference report would cast aside the per \nse rule, and override the Maricopa decision for provider groups and \nprovider-sponsored organizations or PSOs. Members of provider groups, \nsuch as doctors, would not be required to share financial risk in order \nto avoid per se treatment when they collectively set fees at which they \nprovide services. Instead, these loose-knit groups would merely have to \nmeet a checklist of criteria to qualify for the special treatment.\n  None of the group requirements is a substitute for the antitrust \nlaw's requirement of meaningful, shared risk. Under the language of the \nconference report the members need only be part of a group that ``is \nfunded in part by capital contributions made by the members.'' This is \nno substitute for the shared risk required of a joint venture under \nantitrust law.\n  Nor would members of PSOs be required to share financial risk under \ncurrently governing law in order to avoid per se treatment under \ntraditional analysis. Instead, they are provided their own special \nantitrust rule in subsection (e) by which ``affiliated'' providers need \nshare, ``directly or indirectly,'' barely a majority financial interest \nin the PSO. So long as the providers, who would otherwise be \ncompetitors, meet the indirect affiliation provisions of the bill, they \nwill be allowed to exchange information ``relating to costs, sales, \nprofitability, marketing, prices, or fees for any health care product \nor service.''\n  These provisions each require the antitrust enforcement agencies to \nconduct a resource-intensive analysis of the ``properly defined \nmarket'' in order to challenge conduct that normally would be swiftly \ncondemned as price fixing. Given limited enforcement resources, this \nchange in law inevitably would mean that some anticompetitive \nactivities will go unprosecuted. Could it be that this explains the \ndoctors' lobby's insistence on inclusion of this provision in the \nconference report?\n  The provisions regarding the provider groups admittedly have to \nrevenue or savings effect for deficit reduction purposes. The \nprovisions regarding the PSOs did not have a score until, miraculously, \njust before this debate was about to being.\n  Neither set of special rules is integral to Medicare reform. Although \ndefended as a means to encourage provider-sponsored health plans as an \nalternative to insurers, no such special antitrust treatment is needed \nto promote Medicare reform.\n  Provider networks already exist without any special antitrust rule. \nAccording to industry statistics, 20 percent of all PPOs and 15 percent \nof all HMOs are provider-owned. A survey by Modern Healthcare showed \nthat in 1994, without a special antitrust rule, over 9 million people \nwere enrolled in provider-owned PPOs. In addition, many other provider-\nsponsored managed care plans are being developed or planned without the \nenactment of a special antitrust rule. The Physician Payment Review \nCommission concluded in its 1995 Report to Congress that the available \ninformation did not indicate a significant problem of antitrust laws \nimpeding the development of provider-sponsored managed care plans. The \nPPRC Report noted press accounts indicating that many physician-\nsponsored networks are in the process or formation and that ``three-\nfourths of state medical societies are either contemplating or are \nactually in the process of establishing physician-sponsored networks.''\n  Finally, in the past 2 years the Federal Trade Commission and the \nDepartment of Justice have issued literally dozens of staff advisory \nopinions approving the proposed development of provider-sponsored \nnetworks.\n  The Senate bill contains no such provisions. In debate on our bill, \nSenator Frist expressly noted the absence of a Senate provision like \nproposed section 1853(f). Senator Hatch spoke to the ``creative \ntension'' in the health care delivery system involving providers and \ninsurers, and noted Senate consideration of the `` antitrust \nrequirements in current law.'' He concluded that the Senate bill, which \nhad no such special antitrust rule, met the goals of providing real \nhealth care choices while making sure that there is accountability. \nThus, no special antitrust rule was considered necessary when the \nSenate debated its Medicare reform package in its budget reconciliation \nbill a short time ago.\n  These provisions threaten significant injury to competition outside \nthe Medicare program. By allowing competing providers to share \ninformation about ``costs, sales, profitability, marketing, prices, or \nfees'' and to agree on prices in the context of MedicarePlus, the \nexemption is likely to have the effect of dampening competition among \nthose same providers for non-MedicarePlus business. For this reason \namong others, special antitrust rules of this type are opposed by the \nU.S. Chamber of Commerce, the National Business Coalition on Health, \nthe National Manufacturers Association, the ERISA Industry Committee, \nthe Business Roundtable, the APPWP--The Benefits Association, and the \nNational Association of Attorneys General.\n  No language--and certainly not the fig leaf provided in proposed \nsection 1853(f)(1)(B)(ii), which purports to limit the information \nexchanged among providers affiliated with a PSO to having not been used \nfor any other purpose than to establish the PSO--can effectively \nprevent against this spillover effect.\n  Once putative competitors are authorized by statute to share \ninformation about ``costs, sales, profitability, marketing, prices'' \nand fees and to agree on prices for MedicarePlus, they cannot and will \nnot be able to ignore that knowledge they already possess when it comes \nto setting their prices for others.\n  Providers who agree on prices to be demanded from PSOs or as PSOs may \nimplicitly agree to adhere to similar prices with respect to other \nactivities or moderate their competitive behavior based on the \nknowledge gained thereby. Once competing providers have met to \nnegotiate their fees, the information they have exchanged and the \nunderstandings they have reached would likely spill over into their \nother dealings and into non-MedicarePlus areas in which health care \nservices ought to be governed by competitive forces.\n  Thus, Gail R. Wilensky, Ph.D., the Chair of the Physician Payment \nReview Commission, recently testified on September 22, 1995, before the \nHouse Ways and Means Committee on Medicare Reform that ``even if a \nchange (in the antitrust laws) applies only to the Medicare market, it \nmay be difficult to keep potentially anticompetitive practices from \nspilling into other markets served by the networks.''\n  We do not need to enact such provisions and certainly should not do \nso as part of budget reconciliation. I object and trust my colleagues \nwill not approve such changes in our antitrust laws without proper \nanalysis, justification, study or debate.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Madam President, will the Senator from Vermont yield?\n  Mr. LEAHY. Certainly.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I apologize for the second time for interrupting the \ndistinguished Senator from Vermont. We want to accommodate a number of \nschedules, and the clock is ticking. I am trying to see if we can \naccommodate all Senators and arrive at a unanimous consent agreement \nthat will allow us to vote. The distinguished Senator from Florida had \nsome questions.\n  If we could have the unanimous consent request again propounded with \nthe understanding that, in addition to the 30 seconds for the Senator \nfrom New Mexico, the Senator from Florida could have 1 minute to ask \nsome questions, and I would ask unanimous consent that be included, and \npose the motion at this time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? If not, the Chair \nunderstands that there will be 30 seconds for the Senator from New \nMexico, and the Senator from Vermont would have 30 seconds.\n  Mr. LEAHY. No, the Senator from Vermont would complete his statement \nat which point I understand that the Senator from Florida would have a \nminute, the Senator from New Mexico would have 30 seconds, and then we \nwould have the vote that was discussed before.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KYL. Madam President, I further ask unanimous consent that, if \nthe motion to waive is not agreed to and the point of order is \nsustained, that the \n\n[[Page S 17323]]\nSenate proceed immediately to vote on the motion to concur with the \nSenate amendment to the House amendment with no further action or \ndebate, other than 5 minutes for each leader or manager, and that the \nvote be limited to 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Reserving the right to object, I thought I was going to \nget 5 minutes also.\n  Mr. KYL. For each leader and manager, I will amend the request. I am \nsorry. I misread that--each leader and manager.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, to accommodate those Senators who have \nschedules and other debates, I will wrap up with this.\n  The Byrd rule was put here by the distinguished senior Senator from \nWest Virginia because this reconciliation process changes the normal \nprocedures of the Senate. It changes the normal unlimited debate. It \nwas done to handle these fiscal matters, and not to allow a whole lot \nof things to come in without the debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. LEAHY. No. Madam President. That was not the unanimous consent \nrequest, I say to the Chair. The unanimous consent request was that at \nthe conclusion of my time we would have a minute for the Senator from \nFlorida, and 30 seconds for the Senator from New Mexico.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator from Vermont has \nexpired. He had 8 minutes, and the time has expired.\n  Mr. LEAHY. The Chair is correct in that.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the material of the Chamber of Commerce, \nthe National Business Coalition, Health, the National Association of \nAttorneys General and others, who objected to this provision be printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                         Federal Trade Commission,\n\n\n                                        Department of Justice,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, October 31, 1995.\n     Hon. Patrick J. Leahy,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Leahy: The Federal Trade Commission and the \n     Department of Justice (the ``Agencies'') are writing in \n     response to your letters of October 26, 1995, requesting the \n     Agencies' comments on two antitrust provisions in H.R. 2425, \n     the Medicare Preservation Act of 1995. The Administration \n     supports the increased availability of provider networks to \n     promote competition and expand competitive choices for \n     consumers. Further, the Administration believes that \n     legislative reforms, which include appropriate consumer \n     protection safeguards, are necessary to achieve this goal. \n     The Federal Trade Commission has taken no position on aspects \n     of Medicare reform other than the comments in this letter on \n     the two antitrust provisions of H.R. 2425.\n       However, the two antitrust provisions of H.R. 2425--one a \n     broad exemption for medical self-regulatory entities and the \n     other a relaxation of antitrust rules for provider service \n     networks--are unnecessary and could seriously undermine the \n     cost containment goals of Medicare reform efforts. Moreover, \n     these provisions would deprive all consumers--not only \n     Medicare beneficiaries--of the benefits of competition in \n     health care markets. The Agencies urge that Congress not \n     enact these provisions.\n\n\n        antitrust exemption for medical self-regulatory entities\n\n       Section 15221 of H.R. 2425, ``Exemptions from Antitrust \n     Laws for Certain Activities of Medical Self-Regulatory \n     Entities,'' would create a special antitrust exemption for \n     medical groups' setting or enforcing of ``standards'' that \n     are ``designed to promote quality of health care services.'' \n     If enacted, it would provide broad antitrust immunity for \n     anticompetitive activities that purport to improve the \n     quality of care, but in fact raise health care costs and \n     deprive consumers of choices in the marketplace, by \n     anticompetitively excluding other economic participants from \n     health care markets.\n       Antitrust enforcement actions have stopped physicians, \n     acting through medical societies and hospital medical staffs \n     under the guise of quality concerns, from engaging in \n     boycotts, price fixing, and other conduct harmful to \n     consumers. These enforcement actions have been instrumental \n     in enabling competitive alternatives to traditional fee-for-\n     service medicine to enter health care markets in the face of \n     provider opposition. For example, the Agencies enforcement \n     actions have challenged: medical societies' standards that \n     banned procompetitive alternatives to traditional fee-for-\n     service medicine--including physicians' employment by HMOs \n     and affiliation with non-physicians; hospital medical staff \n     boycotts, coercion of hospitals, and abuse of the \n     credentialling process, to block the development of \n     innovative forms of health care delivery, such as health \n     maintenance organizations; and medical societies' boycotts of \n     insurers to force them to pay higher fees to the societies' \n     members.\n       The unfortunate fact is that self-regulatory bodies \n     sometimes act to obstruct competition, and when they do so \n     their actions are often couched in quality-of-care terms. \n     This kind of conduct is not a thing of the past. Continued \n     antitrust enforcement against such anticompetitive activities \n     is essential if competitive forces are to play a role in \n     containing health care costs.\n       Encouraging industry self-regulation that is aimed at \n     improving quality is a laudable goal, but legitimate self-\n     regulatory activity is already permitted under current \n     antitrust law. The Federal Trade Commission and the \n     Department of Justice have not brought suits against such \n     legitimate conduct. In fact, they have repeatedly spread the \n     message that such conduct is lawful.\n       The Report of the House Committee on Ways and Means on H.R. \n     2425 indicates that the exemption for medical self-regulation \n     is intended to address concerns about private lawsuits \n     challenging peer review. The Report states that the Health \n     Care Quality Improvement Act of 1986, 42 U.S.C. Sec. 11101, \n     which eliminated private damage actions for good faith peer \n     review that is undertaken with certain procedural safeguards, \n     has been beneficial, but that antitrust suits have continued. \n     Even if some unjustified suits continue to be brought, \n     concerns about possible imperfections in that statute's \n     limitations on private damage actions would not justify H.R. \n     2425's broad exemption from all antitrust enforcement, \n     particularly including actions by the government.\n       The potential harm from the broadly worded exemption is not \n     significantly limited by Section 15221(b)(2)'s exclusion from \n     immunity where conduct is undertaken ``for purposes \n     of financial gain.'' As noted above, quality of care is \n     typically offered as a justification for anticompetitive \n     conduct by health care providers, sometimes based on the \n     sincere--but erroneous--belief that competition is \n     inappropriate in the health care industry. Moreover, \n     making the availability of immunity turn on defendants' \n     intent, rather than on the objective market consequences \n     of the challenged behavior, offers no real protection for \n     consumers. The absence of a motive for personal financial \n     gain does not lessen the injury to consumers that occurs \n     when competitors engage in conduct that is unreasonably \n     anticompetitive.\n       The Congressional Budget Office concluded that this \n     provision would increase federal spending, rather than \n     promote the cost containment goals of H.R. 2425. And the \n     impact would not be limited to the Medicare program. Granting \n     private medical organizations the power to adopt and enforce \n     standards without the check against abuses that antitrust law \n     provides is likely to stifle innovation, unnecessarily limit \n     consumer choice, and frustrate health care cost containment \n     efforts.\n\n\n       special antitrust treatment for provider service networks\n\n       Section 15021 of Subtitle A of H.R. 2425, ``Special \n     Antitrust Rule for Provider Service Networks,'' would exempt \n     certain groups of health care providers from the per se rule \n     against price-fixing that applies throughout the rest of the \n     economy. This provision is not necessary for the development \n     of the provider-sponsored entities that the Medicare reform \n     bills seek to encourage. It could, however, both undercut \n     H.R. 2425's reliance on competition to provide more cost-\n     effective services to Medicare beneficiaries, and impair non-\n     Medicare competition as well.\n       Like the Senate Medicare bill, H.R. 2425 would permit \n     certain provider organizations to contract directly with the \n     Medicare program to provide all covered services in return \n     for a monthly capitation payment. These organizations are \n     called ``provider service networks'' in the Senate bill and \n     ``provider-sponsored organizations'' (PSOs) in H.R. 2425. \n     ``Provider service networks'' (PSNs) under H.R. 2425 are \n     groups of providers that may contract with a PSO--in essence \n     as subcontractors--to provide services to Medicare \n     beneficiaries.\n       Section 15021(a) provides that the conduct of a PSN or its \n     members in fixing prices would be evaluated only under the \n     ``rule of reason'' antitrust analysis, rather than under the \n     ``per se'' rule usually applicable to price fixing by \n     competitors. Legitimate provider joint ventures already \n     receive ``rule of reason'' treatment, for example, where \n     their members share substantial financial risk. This is \n     because risk-sharing among members of such a group gives each \n     member the incentive to assure that the group as a whole \n     provides services in a cost-effective manner, achieving \n     efficiencies and cost-savings that competition is intended to \n     secure. Under Section 15021(a), however, members of a PSN who \n     do not share any financial risk, and thus do not have those \n     same incentives for cost-savings, would be able to set fees \n     collectively for services provided through a PSO without \n     regard to the usual ``per se'' rule against price fixing.\n       No special antitrust rule is necessary to allow providers \n     to form groups or networks, develop fee schedules for \n     participating providers, or set up providers panels, so long \n     as the providers share financial risk. In fact, \n\n[[Page S 17324]]\n     risk-sharing among providers in a group appears integral to the \n     purposes of the legislation: PSOs and other entities offering \n     Medicare products are required to assume full financial risk \n     for the provision of all covered services, in exchange for a \n     predetermined capitation payment. Under existing antitrust \n     law, such groups already receive rule of reason treatment, \n     and any other provider group that similarly shares financial \n     risks would receive the same antitrust treatment. H.R. 2425 \n     would allow PSNs that do not involve risk-sharing to qualify \n     for special antitrust treatment by meeting certain criteria. \n     However, none of these criteria is a substitute for the \n     incentives created by substantial financial risk-sharing.\n       The goal of promoting more cost-effective delivery of \n     Medicare services would not be furthered by allowing groups \n     of competing providers in a PSN to agree on the prices they \n     would demand from the PSO for treating patients under a \n     Medicare PSO contract, bargain collectively with the PSO, and \n     threaten a boycott if the PSO did not accept the providers' \n     terms. In such a case, even though the anticompetitive effect \n     of the conduct is clear and no countervailing efficiencies \n     are produced, the bill would require the antitrust agencies \n     to conduct a resource-intensive analysis of the market under \n     the rule of reason. Given the constraints on federal \n     antitrust enforcement resources, this can only mean that some \n     plainly anticompetitive activities will go unprosecuted.\n       The impact of the exemption could also extend beyond PSOs \n     to all managed care organizations operating in a particular \n     market. By allowing competing providers to agree on prices in \n     the context of bargaining to provide services to a Medicare \n     PSO, the exemption could have the unintended effect of \n     dampening competition among those same providers for non-PSO \n     business. Providers who agree on prices to be demanded of \n     PSOs may implicitly agree to adhere to similar demands when \n     dealing with other plans. Even absent bad intentions, once \n     competing providers have met to negotiate their fees for PSO \n     business, the information they have exchanged and the \n     understandings they have reached would likely spill over into \n     their dealings not only with other MedicarePlus \n     organizations, but also with the various organizations that \n     provide health care benefits to non-Medicare patients.\n       In sum, the antitrust provision in H.R. 2425 would harm \n     consumers and would run counter to the cost-reduction goals \n     of Medicare reform efforts.\n       The Department of Justice has be advised by the Office of \n     Management and Budget that there is no objection to the \n     submission of this letter from the standpoint of the \n     Administration's program.\n           Sincerely,\n     Anne K. Bingaman,\n       Assistant Attorney General.\n       By direction of the Commission.\n     Robert Pitofsky,\n       Chairman.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                               September 26, 1995.\n     Hon. William V. Roth, Jr.,\n     Chairman, Committee on Finance\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: We are a coalition of physician group \n     practices, non-physician providers, employers, managed care \n     networks and insurers who are opposed to including special \n     antitrust preferences for physicians as part of Medicare \n     reform legislation.\n       Physicians are not alone in feeling the pressure of \n     increased competition. All of us doing business in the health \n     care market are facing increased competition. Yet, we do not \n     believe that competitive pressures warrant special antitrust \n     preferences for physicians or any other provider. Such \n     preferences are unnecessary and harmful to competition and \n     consumer choice in the marketplace. If the goal is to apply \n     the successes of the private health care market to reforming \n     the Medicare program, then weakening the antitrust laws for \n     physicians is truly misguided. Senior citizens and all \n     consumers should have health plan choices--but choices that \n     are indeed competitive.\n       The attached Washington Post article underscores the need \n     to maintain strong antitrust enforcement in order to ensure \n     that consumers, not competitors, determine the range and \n     prices of goods and services offered in the health care \n     marketplace.\n       Unfortunately, the American Medical Association (AMA) is \n     seeking special treatment under the antitrust laws. Under the \n     AMA's proposal, physicians would be allowed to agree on the \n     prices they will charge and collectively negotiate with \n     lawyers while essentially remaining individual competitors. \n     In other words, little substantial risk-sharing on the part \n     of physicians would be required, effectively reducing \n     incentives to compete on cost, quality and efficiency. In \n     addition, physician networks would be subject to more lenient \n     enforcement of the law than all other providers.\n       Advocates of changes to the law contend that current \n     antitrust laws and enforcement must be relaxed to allow \n     physicians to compete on a ``level playing field'' with other \n     network organizers such as hospitals. HMOs and insurers. \n     While this argument may appear reasonable at a glance, a \n     closer examination of the issue reveals quite the opposite. \n     The antitrust changes that the AMA seeks to include as part \n     of Medicare reform are little more than well-disguised \n     attempts to side-step the strong free market protections \n     afforded by current law.\n       The following briefing paper tells the real story.\n           Sincerely,\n         American Group Practice Association, American Association \n           of Nurse Anesthetists, Academy of Nurse Practitioners, \n           American Nurses Association, AETNA, American Managed \n           Care and Review Association, American College of Nurse \n           Mid-wives, Association of Private Pension and Welfare \n           Plans, American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, \n           Blue Cross & Blue Shield Association, CIGNA, FHP Health \n           Care, Group Health Association of America, Health Care \n           Compare, Corp., Health Insurance Association of \n           America, Kaiser Permanente, Kansas City Blue Cross & \n           Blue Shield, Metrahealth, National Association of \n           Manufacturers, National Capital PPO, Nat's Assoc. of \n           Nurse Practitioners in Reproductive Health, Opticians \n           Association of America, Sierra Health Services, The \n           Erisa Industry Committee, The Principal Financial \n           Group, The Prudential, U.S. Healthcare, Inc., Wausau \n           Insurance Companies.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n               [From the Washington Post, Sept. 14, 1995]\n\n              Doctors, Hospitals Sued on Monopoly Charges\n\n       The Justice Department yesterday charged doctors and \n     hospitals in two states with using monopoly power to block \n     lower-priced managed health care systems from competing--in \n     one case for almost a decade.\n       It was the first time the agency's anti-trust division \n     filed price-fixing lawsuits accusing hospitals of scheming \n     with doctors to ensure their own higher profits while health \n     care costs rise.\n       Both groups--in Danbury, Conn., and St. Joseph, Mo--denied \n     the charges. But both also agreed to consent decrees in which \n     they promised to change the way they do business.\n       The complaint said that beginning in May 1994 and \n     continuing through August, Danbury Hospital, the only \n     acutecare facility in the area, forced patients to use its \n     outpatient facilities, joined with ``virtually all of the \n     doctors on its medical staff' to raise fees, and purposely \n     limited the size and mix of its medical staff to reduce \n     competition among local doctors.\n       In Missouri, the Justice Department said, the price-fixing \n     conspiracy occurred from April 1986 through June 1995. The \n     complaint said about 85 percent of the doctors in Buchanan \n     County formed a group in 1986 ``to prevent or delay the \n     development of managed care in the area.''\n       In 1990, the group then joined with the only local \n     hospital, Heartland, to form Health Choice to further lock up \n     the medical services and profits in the area, the lawsuit \n     said.\n\nSpecial Antitrust Preferences for Physicians Limit Competition, Choice \n                and Innovation in the Health Care Market\n\n       Current antitrust law does allow for the formation of \n     physician-sponsored networks.\n       Physicians can join together and agree on price and other \n     terms of business so long as they ``integrate'' by sharing \n     financial risk. Risk-sharing can be achieved in a variety of \n     ways and is critical to ensure that physicians do not come \n     together to simply fix prices while remaining separate \n     competitors. Numerous physician networks have successfully \n     ``integrated'' and are now competing in virtually every \n     market in the country. Some of the most notable examples are \n     the Mayo Clinic in Minnesota and the Cleveland Clinic in \n     Ohio. These multi-specialty physician group practices were \n     formed under existing antitrust laws, without special \n     preferences.\n       Alternatively physicians can also join together to form \n     Preferred Provider Organizations (PPOs) and negotiate fees \n     with HMOs and other third-party payers without integrating \n     their practices. These more loosely organized groups can \n     perform many of the same functions as their fully integrated \n     counterparts, including quality assurance, utilization \n     review, and administrative services. Guidelines issued by the \n     Department of Justice (DOJ) and the Federal Trade Commission \n     (FTC) make this clear.\n       Loosening integration requirements is harmful to consumers \n     because it reduces the incentive for providers to compete. \n     Current integration requirements are not barriers to the \n     formation physician-sponsored plans. They are barriers to \n     price-fixing, boycotts and other forms of anti-market \n     activities. Ultimately, substantial financial integration is \n     what drives competition on quality, efficiency and cost.\n       Physicians are not disadvantaged with respect to other \n     providers under the antitrust laws.\n       The purpose of strong antitrust enforcement policies is to \n     protect consumers, not competitors. The notion that \n     physicians need special antitrust preferences because the \n     antitrust laws are biased against physicians is inaccurate \n     and misleading. Joint ventures arranged by like competitors \n     in every other industry are subject to essentially the same \n     level of scrutiny as physician-sponsored networks.\n       Similarly, insurers and other providers are not exempt from \n     antitrust enforcement. If insurers either agreed among \n     themselves on payment levels or tried to wield market power \n     by driving prices down, they too would run afoul of the \n     antitrust laws.\n       In its 1995 Report to Congress, the Physician Payment \n     Review Commission (PPRC) \n\n[[Page S 17325]]\n     concluded that ``the available evidence of problems is not sufficient \n     to warrant creating safe harbors or other exemptions from the \n     antitrust laws for physician-sponsored networks at this time. \n     Amending the antitrust laws is a serious step that should be \n     undertaken only in the face of compelling evidence that \n     change is required. The limited available factual evidence, \n     however, does not currently suggest the widespread existence \n     of problems.''\n       Consequently, what the AMA is really asking for is the \n     ability to compete outside the free market principles that \n     every other competitor must abide by.\n       Special antitrust treatment for physicians, such as loose \n     integration requirements and substitution of the rule of \n     reason for the per se rule would diminish consumer power in \n     the marketplace.\n       A number of changes to the antitrust laws have been \n     advocated by the AMA, ranging from outright exemptions to \n     relaxing risk-sharing requirements and elimination of the per \n     se rule. The per se rule has allowed the courts and \n     enforcement agencies to efficiently call a halt to activities \n     that are blatantly harmful to consumers. It reflects a \n     determination that some conduct--such as price-fixing and \n     group boycotts--is so likely to harm consumers that it should \n     be found unlawful in all circumstances. It is a rule that \n     applies to all providers and all industries.\n       The rule of reason, in contrast, requires a balancing of \n     the competitive harm arising from particular conduct against \n     the possible economic benefits it produces. However, it is \n     also more difficult under this rule to challenge \n     anticompetitive conduct because many more creative defenses \n     and justifications can be raised. If antitrust enforcement \n     agencies could only prosecute antitrust violations by \n     provider physician-sponsored networks under the rule of \n     reason, they would be forced to utilize greater resources and \n     face a reduced likelihood of success. If rule of reason \n     treatment was extended to provider-sponsored networks, but \n     not to other types of health care networks, provider \n     organizations would enjoy distinct advantages that would not \n     be shared by other health plans. This would put those plans \n     at a competitive disadvantage.\n       History is replete with examples of physician group \n     boycotts and efforts to keep other physician group practices \n     and non-physicians, such as nurse mid-wives and nurse \n     anesthetists, from offering consumers choice. One of the best \n     examples of this is the experience of the physician-owned \n     Cleveland Clinic. In 1991, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) \n     put a halt to physician boycotts aimed at preventing \n     Cleveland Clinic doctors from establishing a practice in \n     Florida. This case was brought under the per se rule--the \n     very rule from which AMA seeks an exemption. Similarly, prior \n     to 1979, the AMA bound its members to rules that prevented \n     physicians from contracting with HMOs. These rules \n     effectively prevented price competition among doctors and \n     hindered the development of new, innovative health care \n     delivery systems, such as HMOs and PPOs. The Supreme Court \n     agreed and forced the AMA to drop its anticompetitive rules.\n       The DOJ and FTC have provided substantial guidance to \n     health care providers to address their concerns.\n       In response to concerns raised by providers, the Department \n     of Justice (DOJ) and the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) \n     jointly issued the Statements of Antitrust Enforcement Policy \n     in the Health Care Area. These statements, or guidelines, \n     provide a detailed road map of the analysis that the federal \n     enforcement agencies will apply to the most significant \n     issues facing the health care industry. The guidelines \n     include ``safety zones'' clarifying what types of mergers, \n     joint ventures, and other activities would be considered \n     lawful. The DOJ/FTC have made a special effort to address \n     physician networks and rural health care markets.\n       For physicians and other providers who have questions about \n     forming integrated networks, the agencies offer opportunities \n     for more specific advice through their business review and \n     advisory opinion letter process. The agencies' business \n     review and advisory opinion procedures allow parties to \n     obtain a statement of the agencies' enforcement intentions \n     before the transaction is implemented. The agencies have \n     committed to providing expedited 90-day reviews. The agencies \n     have also committed to continued monitoring of evolving \n     health care markets so they can respond to changes on an on-\n     going basis. To date, virtually every physician-sponsored \n     network has been approved.\n       The health care industry has responded enthusiastically to \n     these initiatives. According to a January 1995 Bureau of \n     National Affairs (BNA) survey of counselors advising \n     providers, the ``almost blanket clearances by the Justice \n     Department and FTC of proposals to create managed care \n     networks is assuaging health care industry concerns about the \n     impact of antitrust law . . .''\n                                                                    ____\n\n         Business for Medicare Reform: APPWP--The Benefits \n           Association; The Business Roundtable; The ERISA \n           Industry Committee; National Association of \n           Manufacturers; National Business Coalition on Health; \n           U.S. Chamber of Commerce,\n                                                 October 17, 1995.\n     Hon. Newt Gingrich,\n     Hon. William Archer,\n     Hon. Michael Bilirakis,\n     Hon. Thomas Bliley,\n     Hon. Dennis Hastert,\n     Hon. Gerald Solomon,\n     Hon. William Thomas.\n       Dear Representatives: We are writing as representatives of \n     small and large businesses who have been supportive of your \n     efforts to save Medicare by passing the Medicare Preservation \n     Act. We have been gratified by the commitment you have made \n     to fundamentally restructuring Medicare by drawing on the \n     successful health care reform strategies pioneered by private \n     employers. Moreover, employers have been willing to accept \n     considerable costs in order to save Medicare.\n       Just a very few years ago, most health care policymakers \n     and analysts believed that the private sector could not \n     contain health care costs. Employers have proved this wrong, \n     by using their purchasing power to create more competitive \n     markets and demanding better care at lower cost. Based on our \n     knowledge of what it took to get this job done, we have \n     important reservations about a limited number of the Medicare \n     Preservation Act's provisions. We are concerned that these \n     provisions would undermine the very strategies that (a) \n     employers have used to control costs and improve quality and \n     (b) the Act uses as the foundation for a new and sustainable \n     Medicare program. We urge you to reconsider these provisions.\n       Our most important concerns are as follows:\n       Antitrust Changes for Health Care Providers. We are \n     extremely concerned by the antitrust law changes included in \n     Sections 15021 and 15221 of the Act, which would affect \n     employer-sponsored health plans as well as MedicarePlus \n     plans. We ask that they be stricken.\n       Unfortunately, organized medicine has a long history of \n     attempting to suppress alternative health care delivery \n     systems. Antitrust enforcement has been an important tool in \n     overcoming this opposition to innovative ways of delivering \n     higher quality care at lower cost. Section 15221's changes to \n     antitrust law would allow organized medicine to engage in a \n     much higher level of anticompetitive activity, thereby \n     increasing costs and reducing the quality of care. In \n     contrast, employers have created the new, competitive health \n     care market and better ways to measure and improve quality \n     under current antitrust law, which also leaves broad \n     leeway for health care providers to collaborate in \n     legitimate self-regulatory activity.\n       Employers have been able to control costs and improve \n     quality by using their purchasing power to create competitive \n     health care markets. The antitrust law changes in Section \n     15021 would shift the balance between health care providers \n     and purchasers in favor of providers, undermining employers' \n     ability to be effective purchasers and jeopardizing their \n     hard won victories over health care cost inflation and poor \n     quality care. Putting purchasers at a disadvantage by \n     changing antitrust law risks a return to health care \n     hyperinflation and unaccountability for quality.\n       Medical Liability Reforms. Employers have long supported \n     medical liability reform, including changes to the collateral \n     source rule. However, the version of collateral source rule \n     reform in the Act eliminates employers' right of subrogation. \n     This shifts the cost of treating injuries caused by a \n     negligent provider from the provider who caused the injury to \n     employers. We urge that you revise the Act to provide for a \n     different version of collateral source rule reform that \n     appropriately prevents double recovery by plaintiffs without \n     inappropriately shifting responsibility for injuries caused \n     by negligent providers to employers.\n       Medicare Secondary Payer Expansions. The Act expands \n     employers' Medicare secondary payer liability. This does \n     nothing to improve health care efficiency or quality. Rather, \n     it simply shifts costs to private sector payers. Small \n     employers in particular are vulnerable to this kind of cost-\n     shifting. We urge that the expansions of Medicare secondary \n     payer liability be eliminated.\n       As you know, managed care plans able to efficiently deliver \n     high quality care have played a key role in employers' \n     market-based health reform strategy. No aspect of the \n     Medicare Preservation Act is more important to employers than \n     its treatment of managed care plans. We are gratified that \n     the Act as introduced by Chairman Archer and Chairman Bliley \n     did not include antimanaged care rules. Including antimanaged \n     care rules in the Act would increase costs and reduce \n     quality. Moreover, including antimanaged care rules would \n     directly and adversely affect employer-sponsored health plans \n     as well as MedicarePlus plans, since the same networks will \n     serve Medicare beneficiaries and employer-sponsored plans.\n       It is our understanding that most of the antimanaged care \n     rules adopted in committee as amendments to the Act have been \n     stricken. (These amendments included restrictions on (1) the \n     criteria health plans may use when selecting providers, (2) \n     efforts to eliminate medically inappropriate emergency room \n     treatment and (3) denial of care that is not medically \n     necessary.) We applaud this result. We urge you to strike the \n     remaining antimanaged care amendment (restricting permissible \n     contractual relationships between health plans and providers) \n     and to continue adhering to the policy of avoiding \n     antimanaged care rules as the Medicare Preservation Act moves \n     through the legislative process.\n\n[[Page S 17326]]\n\n       It also is our understanding that a technical error in the \n     medical liability reforms that would have inadvertently \n     expanded employers' liability by interfering with current \n     grievance procedures provided for under the Employee \n     Retirement Income Security Act has been resolved. We \n     appreciate your efforts to resolve this matter, which is \n     vitally important to employers who voluntarily sponsor health \n     benefits for their employees.\n       Again, we strongly support your efforts to save Medicare. \n     It is essential that they succeed. However, as \n     representatives of the businesses that originated the \n     strategies that the Medicare Preservation Act is built on, we \n     urge adoption of a few technical changes that would greatly \n     strengthen the Act's ability to achieve its goals. These \n     changes also would eliminate our concerns about the Act's \n     effects on businesses that voluntarily offer health benefits \n     to their employees.\n       We would be pleased to further discuss these issues with \n     you at your convenience.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                         U.S. Chamber of Commerce,\n\n\n                                 Business for Medicare Reform,\n\n                                                 October 23, 1995.\n     Hon. William V. Roth, Jr.,\n     Chairman, Finance Committee,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Roth. We are writing as representatives of \n     small and large businesses that are working hard to control \n     health care costs and improve quality. We have been gratified \n     by the Finance Committee's decision to fundamentally improve \n     Medicare by drawing on the successful health reform \n     strategies pioneered by private employers.\n       Just a few years ago, most health care policymakers \n     believed that the private sector could not contain health \n     care costs. Employers have proved this wrong, by using their \n     purchasing power to create more competitive markets, \n     demanding better care at lower costs, measuring outcomes and \n     consumer satisfaction, and developing networks through \n     selective contracting with the best providers. Based on our \n     knowledge of what it took to get this job done, we are \n     concerned that potential floor amendments to the Finance \n     Committee bill would undermine the very strategies that (a) \n     employers have used to control costs and improve quality and \n     (b) the bill uses as the foundation for a new and sustainable \n     Medicare program. These potential amendments include \n     antitrust exemptions for health care providers and mandated \n     point-of-service coverage by network-based plans. We strongly \n     oppose these potential amendments to the Finance Committee \n     bill.\n       The damage that would be caused by adding these amendments \n     to Medicare reform legislation would not be limited to higher \n     Medicare costs and lower quality. Because Medicare is such a \n     large factors in health care markets and because Medicare and \n     employer-sponsored health plans will use the same provider \n     networks, antitrust exceptions for providers and antimanaged \n     care rules would directly harm employer-sponsored plans. \n     Working Americans and their families would face higher costs, \n     reduced coverage and lower quality.\n\n\n                   opposition to antitrust exemptions\n\n       One potential amendment would grant an antitrust exemption \n     to medical self-regulatory organizations. Unfortunately, \n     organized medicine has a long history of attempting to \n     suppress coordinated health care delivery systems. Antitrust \n     enforcement has been an important tool in overcoming this \n     opposition to innovative ways of delivering higher quality \n     care at lower cost. An antitrust exemption for medical self-\n     regulatory organizations would allow organized medicine to \n     engage in a much higher level of anticompetitive activity, \n     thereby increasing costs and reducing the quality of care. \n     Notably, current antitrust law leaves broad leeway for health \n     care providers to collaborate in legitimate self-regulatory \n     activity.\n       Employer-led efforts to improve accountability and quality \n     in the health care system by making data available to health \n     care consumers has been a leading cause of the positive \n     changes in the health care market. This data has become \n     available--often in the face of provider resistance--only \n     because private employees took the initiative to develop it \n     and demand that providers supply it. Granting providers an \n     antitrust exemption, thereby permitting them to monopolize \n     the quality standard-setting process, will seriously erode \n     accountability for quality and value.\n       Another potential antitrust amendment would grant an \n     exemption to provider-sponsored organizations. Employers have \n     been able to control costs and improve quality by using their \n     purchasing power to create competitive health care markets. \n     An antitrust exemption for provider-sponsored organizations \n     would shift the balance between health care providers and \n     purchasers in favor of providers, undermining employers' \n     ability to be effective purchasers. Putting purchasers at a \n     disadvantage by changing antitrust law risks a return to \n     health care hyperinflation and unaccountability for quality.\n\n\n                 opposition to point-of-service mandate\n\n       A recent Lewin-VHI study found that a point-of-service \n     mandate would add even more to the nation's health care bill \n     than an ``any willing provider'' mandate. Experience confirms \n     a point-of-service mandate's high cost. A study of Florida \n     employers' 1993 health crisis found that point-of-service \n     plans cost over 20 percent more than HMOs. Prohibiting \n     closed-panel plans from participating in Medicare would force \n     even those Medicare beneficiaries who want to enroll in a \n     closed-panel plan--such as the 3 million seniors who already \n     have chosen such plans over the traditional Medicare system--\n     to pay higher premiums.\n       A point-of-service mandate undermines the entire purpose of \n     Medicare reform. Because the traditional Medicare program is \n     unsustainable, the Finance Committee bill encourages \n     beneficiaries to shift to private health plans. A point-of-\n     service mandate would drive up private plans' costs, \n     encouraging continued enrollment in the government-run \n     system. As a result, Medicare reform would fail to produce a \n     modernized, more efficient Medicare.\n       Both point-of-service plans and closed panel plans have \n     earned an important place in the market--based on consumers' \n     choices, not government mandates. In fact, employers have \n     found that employee enrollment in closed panel HMOs increased \n     at the same time that point-of-service plan availability and \n     enrollment increased. Market forces rather than government \n     microregulation should determine point-of-service plans' role \n     in Medicare. Certainly, the federal government should not \n     deny consumers the freedom to choose and the savings of \n     private health plans that only contract with selected \n     providers. Moreover, the Finance Committee bill requires all \n     plans that only contract with selected providers, like every \n     other private plan (but not the traditional government-run \n     Medicare program), to meet quality standards.\n       The Finance Committee made the right choice by keeping \n     antitrust exemptions for organized medicine and a point-of-\n     service mandate out of its Medicare reform bill. We urge you \n     to oppose any floor amendments that would add these \n     provisions, or any other antimanaged care rules, to the \n     Finance Committee's Medicare bill.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                           National Association of\n\n\n                                            Attorneys General,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, October 26, 1995.\n     Hon. Newt Gingrich,\n     Speaker of the House, House of Representatives,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Speaker Gingrich: As Chair and Vice-Chair of the \n     Antitrust Committee and Chair and Vice-Chair of the Health \n     Care Task Force of the National Association of Attorneys \n     General (NAAG), we are writing to express our concern about \n     two antitrust provisions included in H.R. 2425, the Medicare \n     Preservation Act of 1995. These provisions, sections 15021 \n     and 15221 of the Act, are unnecessary and could frustrate the \n     cost-containment goals of the Medicare legislation. We urge \n     that these provisions not be included in the final Medicare \n     reform package.\n       The Attorneys General, as chief law officers of their \n     states, are the primary enforcers of the states' antitrust \n     law, and also represent their states and the citizens of \n     their states in federal antitrust litigation. As chief legal \n     officers, the Attorneys General have had and continue to have \n     an important role in the development of national competition \n     policy. We know first-hand that the antitrust laws benefit \n     consumers by protecting competition and promoting efficiency, \n     innovation, low prices, better management and greater \n     consumer choice. Although the Attorneys General as a group \n     have not had an opportunity to consider this legislation, \n     past NAAG policy positions have consistently opposed both new \n     antitrust exemptions and the weakening of antitrust \n     enforcement standards for specific industries.\n       Section 15221 of the Act provides an exemption from both \n     state and federal antitrust laws for activity relating to \n     medical self-regulation. We believe that inclusion of this \n     provision is inadvisable. Unfortunately, state Attorneys \n     General have had experience with physicians and other health \n     care providers who have engaged in anticompetitive \n     activities, including physicians' attempts to eliminate \n     competition from HMOs, PPOs and allied health care \n     professionals. For this reason, in a 1993 Resolution, the \n     Attorneys General stated their belief that exempting health \n     care providers from the antitrust laws is undesirable. Nor is \n     the exemption contained in section 15221 necessary. Current \n     antitrust law permits collaborative activities, including \n     standard-setting activities, that benefit the public and do \n     not injure competition.\n       Section 15021 of the Act provides that certain actions of a \n     provider service network or an individual member of that \n     network shall not be deemed illegal per se under either \n     federal or state antitrust law, but shall instead be judged \n     under the ``rule of reason.'' We are concerned that this \n     relaxation of antitrust standards could lead to higher \n     prices and fewer choices for consumers. Under current law, \n     per se treatment is reserved for the most anticompetitive \n     conduct, including horizontal price-fixing. As stated in a \n     1986 NAAG Resolution, the Attorneys General oppose new \n     industry-specific antitrust standards because present \n     antitrust standards adequately protect the interests of \n     businesses, as well as consumers, by preventing activities \n     that have no pro-competitive justification. More \n     specifically, in the health care area, the Attorneys \n     General believe that competition promotes more affordable \n     health care, development of innovative new delivery \n     systems, and increased information for health care \n     consumers.\n       Finally, we are concerned about the broad preemption of \n     state antitrust enforcement, particularly in section 15221, \n     which is not limited to protection of activities within the \n     Medicare program. In a 1994 Resolution, the \n\n[[Page S 17327]]\n     Attorneys General opposed preemption of state antitrust enforcement in \n     the health care area because such preemption crodes state \n     sovereignty and threatens the system of federalism \n     established by the Constitution. Health care is predominately \n     a local industry that varies significantly from state to \n     state. The Attorneys General, as chief law enforcement \n     officers, should continue to be able to prevent \n     anticompetitive behavior within each state.\n       If you have any questions about our views, please feel free \n     to contact us or Emily Myers, NAAG Counsel for Antitrust and \n     Health at (202) 434-8015.\n           Very truly yours,\n     J.

It is our understanding that the \n     reconciliation bill before the Senate includes a number of \n     anti-consumer provisions which may violate the Byrd rule. \n     Those provisions include antitrust exemptions for provider \n     service networks, elimination of laboratory testing standards \n     for most tests performed in physician offices, preemption of \n     state authority to implement consumer protection standards \n     for managed care plans and physician self-referral.\n       On behalf of the following organizations, we strongly ask \n     that you support every effort to remove these harmful \n     provisions from the reconciliation bill. Inclusion of the \n     items listed above will drive up costs, threaten patient \n     safety and reduce the quality of health care for all \n     Americans.\n           Sincerely,\n         AIDS Action Council, American Public Health Association, \n           Church Women United, Citizen Action, Consumer \n           Federation of America, Consumers Union, National \n           Association of Social Workers, National Farmers Union, \n           National Council of Senior Citizens, Neighbor To \n           Neighbor, Public Citizen's Congress Watch, Service \n           Employees International Union.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida is recognized for a \nminute.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Madam President, I would like to ask if the Senator from \nArizona would please respond to a question. I hope they could be \nanswered ``yes'' or ``no''.\n  Mr. KYL. If I can.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Does this provision relate exclusively to the Federal, or \ndoes it apply to State antitrust law?\n  Mr. KYL. My understanding is that it applies to both Federal and \nState.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Please refer to the bottom line, page 17, No. 2. Does \nthis provision relate exclusively to Medicaid, or does it apply to \nother forms of health care?\n  Mr. KYL. It refers only to the Medicare contracts, and the \norganizations pursuant to obtaining the Medicare contract.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. I would ask the Senator to refer to 318, paragraph B.\n  Thank you, Madam President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, the Byrd rule was put into effect--not \nthat it would rule all the time but that it would be waived.\n  I submit that anybody in this body that wants the Medicare law to \nwork in rural areas, if you talked to anybody in rural areas, they will \ntell you one of the most important things pending before us, to see \nthat we get delivery in rural areas, is this provision which is being \ndropped, if we make it subject to the Byrd rule. Because, without it in \nrural areas there will be no ability for doctors and hospitals in the \nrural areas to get together and have new units to deliver health care. \nThere will be no competition and no service except for monster HMOs in \nthe rural areas.\n  We really ought to waive the Byrd rule in this instance.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has expired. The question is on \nagreeing to the motion to waive the Congressional Budget Act with \nrespect to the antitrust provision. On this question, the yeas and nays \nhave been ordered, and the clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Are there any other Senators in the Chamber \nwho desire to vote?\n  The yeas and nays resulted--yeas 54, nays 45, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 583 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--54\n\n     Abraham\n     Ashcroft\n     Baucus\n     Bennett\n     Bond\n     Breaux\n     Brown\n     Burns\n     Campbell\n     Coats\n     Cochran\n     Cohen\n     Coverdell\n     Craig\n     D'Amato\n     DeWine\n     Dole\n     Domenici\n     Faircloth\n     Frist\n     Gorton\n     Gramm\n     Grams\n     Grassley\n     Gregg\n     Hatch\n     Hatfield\n     Helms\n     Hutchison\n     Inhofe\n     Jeffords\n     Kassebaum\n     Kempthorne\n     Kyl\n     Lott\n     Lugar\n     Mack\n     McCain\n     McConnell\n     Murkowski\n     Nickles\n     Nunn\n     Pressler\n     Roth\n     Santorum\n     Shelby\n     Simpson\n     Smith\n     Snowe\n     Stevens\n     Thomas\n     Thompson\n     Thurmond\n     Warner\n\n                                NAYS--45\n\n     Akaka\n     Biden\n     Bingaman\n     Boxer\n     Bradley\n     Bryan\n     Bumpers\n     Byrd\n     Chafee\n     Conrad\n     Daschle\n     Dodd\n     Dorgan\n     Exon\n     Feingold\n     Feinstein\n     Ford\n     Glenn\n     Graham\n     Harkin\n     Heflin\n     Hollings\n     Inouye\n     Johnston\n     Kennedy\n     Kerrey\n     Kerry\n     Kohl\n     Lautenberg\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Lieberman\n     Mikulski\n     Moseley-Braun\n     Moynihan\n     Murray\n     Pell\n     Pryor\n     Reid\n     Robb\n     Rockefeller\n     Sarbanes\n     Simon\n     Specter\n     Wellstone\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. On this vote, the yeas are 54, the nays are \n45. Three-fifths of the Senators duly chosen and sworn not having voted \nin the affirmative, the motion is not agreed to.\n  The Chair is prepared to rule on the points of order made by the \nSenator from Nebraska.\n  The Chair sustains both points of order.\n  The question before the Senate is whether the Senate shall recede \nfrom its amendment to H.R. 2491 and concur therein with a further \namendment. Pursuant to the Budget Act, that amendment is the text of \nthe conference report (House Report 104-350) excluding the provisions \nstricken on the points of order.\n  According to the previous order, each leader and each manager have 5 \nminutes for debate.\n  Who seeks recognition? Who seeks recognition under the previous \norder? Under the previous order, each leader and each manager has 5 \nminutes.\n  The Senator from Nebraska is recognized for 5 minutes.\n  (Mr. GORTON assumed the chair.)\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, in a few minutes, the Senate will \nunfortunately adopt this conference report to the reconciliation bill.\n  Although I will not vote for the legislation, I certainly want to \ncongratulate Chairman Domenici for his leadership and for the many \nmonths of yeoman labor that he put in on this piece of legislation. He \nmade the hard choices, some good and, in my opinion, many bad, but he \nwas a true leader of great merit, and I congratulate him.\n  Mr. President, my colleagues on the other side of the aisle will \nsavor their victory, but I must also say to all Senators that it is \ntime to move on. With victory short lived and the fate of this bill \ncertain, it will soon take its place in veto history.\n  Mr. President, where do we go from here? In my 17 years in the \nSenate, I have never seen such a poisonous atmosphere as the one that \nhangs thick over the Nation's Capitol. The nervous truce that existed \nin January has collapsed. We are, in the words of President Lincoln, \n``a house divided against itself.'' I still nurture the hope that we \nwill find a way out of this morass and that our leaders--especially \nthose in the other body--will set aside pettiness, vanity, and rigid \nideology for the good of the Nation. There is no honor in the dishonor \nthat has been brought about by the actions of the last few days and the \nlast few hours.\n  I firmly believe, with every fiber in my body, that we should balance \nthe budget. So do the American people. It is the stark route that the \nRepublican majority took, however, that cleaves our ranks.\n  I tell my Republican friends that if we ever can come to an agreement \non a balanced budget, we cannot adhere to the current formulas that \nexist in the conference report. It hobbles any hope that we can redeem \nour differences in a constructive alliance to balance the budget. But \nwe must keep trying.\n  I yield my remaining time. \n\n[[Page S 17328]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from New \nMexico is recognized.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, fellow Senators, I have a lot of people \nto thank for this evening. While the Senators on that side do not think \nit is a very joyous or auspicious occasion, Senators on this side do, \nand I do. I have waited a long time, as a U.S. Senator, to see this \nevening arrive. It is truly a historic opportunity for politicians \nbecause, as I see it, this was the one chance we have to vote for the \nfuture. We have an opportunity every day to vote for something for \ntoday, a program for today, something to give to people today. But, \nessentially, what we are voting on this evening is a vote for the \nfuture of this country and for children not yet born and for those who \nare not yet receiving anything from the Federal Government, but who \nwant an opportunity and have a dream.\n  We are saying the one thing that makes that more and more difficult \nis 25 years of fiscal policy that has the United States borrowing as if \nno one else needed any money, as if those that work, those that need \ninvestment did not need money, just the Federal Government needed it. \nAnd it was like we were a money tree, America was a money tree, and the \nmoney all went to Washington. And when we did not have enough, we \nborrowed it from foreigners--from Japan, from our banks, from our \npeople. The question is: Who will pay the piper?\n  We have decided here tonight that the piper will not be our children \nand grandchildren, but rather in due course, the adults who live today \nwill pay for what we give to our people today and provide a future for \nour children and grandchildren.\n  Now, I understand that the President is going to veto this bill, and \nI have a word for the President. Since he has told us in advance, I \nwould like to tell him in advance. As he sits down with his veto pen, I \nhope he feels heavy, because on his shoulders is our future and our \nchildren's future. As he signs with that left hand of his, he better \nhave something pretty good in mind for our children in the future, \nbecause he is throwing away a real legacy of opportunity, and he better \nbe prepared to tell us and tell the American people and tell our senior \ncitizens what he has in mind, because I have not seen anything yet that \nhe has in mind that comes anywhere close to what we are giving to our \nchildren and grandchildren here tonight when we vote ``aye'' on this \nmeasure.\n  For those who have voted these many times--58 votes on the budget \nresolution, and I do not know how many different times--I say to each \none of them, your vote was not in vain. And if those on the other side \nand in the White House think they will use this against us, just think \nwhat we are going to use against them if this President vetoes this and \nwe end up with nothing.\n  For those who are against that, there is a real chance that we will \nget nothing, except $200 billion in deficits for as far as the eye can \nsee. I also say to those who voted for it, and will vote for it again \ntonight, you have changed the course of fiscal policy and the way we \nspend our people's money forever, because no longer will a Budget \nCommittee in the future have its hearings and hear ``there is no way we \ncan cut spending, and we cannot do this and we cannot cut that.''\n  Well, we have shown that, in a very fair way, we can do what is \nnecessary to get a balanced budget. So we have changed forever the \nprofligacy of a great Nation, and we ought to be proud of it and \nthankful for it.\n  To all the chairmen who worked so hard, thank you. I want to close \nand say to our leader, Senator Dole, thank you for all the confidence \nyou placed in me. When I had to get things done, you told me ``do \nthem.'' When I needed tough decisions and I could not get the votes, \nyou said, ``Bring them in my office.'' And last, I thank the \nbudgeteers. You have a tough job; you do not get to pass anything \nexcept this crazy resolution that cuts everything, but I thank you for \nyour unity and your support. It has been a privilege being your \nchairman. Thank you very much.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Democratic \nleader is recognized for a period of not to exceed 5 minutes.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I yield 2 minutes to the Senator from New \nJersey.\n  Mr. BRADLEY. Mr. President, this reconciliation bill, from top to \nbottom, is intoxicated with the fantasy that it is abandoning the \nwelfare state. Mr. President, we do not have a welfare state, we have a \nsafety net for a few poor people. This drives big holes in that safety \nnet. Welfare reform--block grants replace welfare. What it does is take \nmoney from Federal pols and give it to State pols. The theory is, if \nyou do not like Washington, you are going to love Lansing, or Trenton, \nor the State capital. Hardly. What this does is, in the Federal \ncommitment to poor children, 1.2 million more children will be plunged \ninto poverty because of this. The Medicaid block grant. Send it all \nback to the States. Do not say who is eligible, and do not say what the \nbenefits will be, or how the providers will provide the benefits. Just \nsend the money back.\n  The only thing we know is that when we pass this bill, 12 million \nAmericans will be uninsured. Uninsured. I predict that, 5 years from \nnow, there will be Medicaid scandals in States where Governors are \nputting in a health care program that will help their constituencies.\n  Why are State governments different? They are not. For what purpose? \nThe purpose is that we are giving a gigantic break to wealthy \nAmericans. On the other side, they say, ``Oh, no, only 35 percent of \nthe cut goes to people above $75,000.'' Yes, but they only represent 13 \npercent of the people. And embedded in this bill for estates of $2.5 \nmillion is an $800,000 tax cut. At the same time, we are ripping holes \nin the safety net, we are giving estates of $2.5 million an $800,000 \ntax cut. We should say ``no.''\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I want to commend the distinguished \nranking member for the excellent job he has done in representing our \ncaucus and commend all of the Members who have played a role in on our \nside, as we have debated this bill.\n  I believe that this is the most dangerous document in America. I \nbelieve it is one of the most extreme documents that we have had before \nthis Congress in the time that I have served here. When the lowest 20 \npercent of the people in this country lose more than all the other 80 \npercent combined, that is extreme. When the upper 20 percent gain more \nthan all the other 80 percent combined, that is extreme.\n  When you see the biggest shift in income from the middle class to the \ntop brackets in history--Mr. President, there is no other word to \ndescribe it but extreme. When it represents the biggest cut in health \ncare benefits in history, Mr. President, this document belongs in the \nGuinness Book of World Records.\n  The American people did not vote to see the kind of change this \ndocument represents. No one in this country voted to gut Medicare $270 \nbillion to provide tax breaks for those who do not need them. No one \nvoted to cut Medicaid $163 billion to provide tax breaks for those who \ndo not need them.\n  The distinguished Senator from New Mexico talked about protecting our \nchildren. How in Heaven's name do we protect our children when we cut \nthe legs out from under them in education, in student loans, in \nnutrition programs, in housing, in virtually every single area of \nopportunity this country has provided them--how do we do that? How in \nthe name of children can we stand up and support this document?\n  Mr. President, we can do better than this. The American people now by \nmore than a 2 to 1 margin believe--demand--we do better than this. The \nPresident will veto it, and he has good reason to veto it.\n  We need to sit down together and take the extreme measures out of \nthis document. We need to work to govern better. We need to send a \nbetter message to the American people.\n  We will not gut the investments in people that we have committed to \nfor a long, long time. The most dangerous document in America needs to \nbe vetoed and, indeed, it will be.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order the majority leader \nis recognized for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I think probably the most extreme thing that \nhas happened in the last 2 or 3 years is \n\n[[Page S 17329]]\nthe $265 billion tax increase passed by this Congress without a single \nRepublican vote. You talk about extremism--that is a good example, \nparticularly when the initiator confesses that he raised taxes too \nmuch, the President of the United States.\n  I believe we have a good package here. We have had a lot of work, and \nI want to thank, first of all, Senator Domenici and the entire Budget \nCommittee, but everyone else on this side of the aisle who have been \nworking the past several weeks to bring us to this moment.\n  I really believe, and I am sitting here thinking I have cast a lot of \nvotes in the U.S. Senate. I think this is probably the most important \none that I will cast, knowing it is not bipartisan. I would like to \nhave it bipartisan. But it is a very important vote. It is a \nfundamental change in America. It is a fundamental change in direction \nin this country. I think it is probably the most important vote I have \ncast in my years in the Senate.\n  I have never been so certain that we are doing something right--yes, \nright--for our children, as the Senator from New Mexico pointed out, \nfor our grandchildren, and for everybody else.\n  It is right for States. Yes, we are giving some power back to the \nGovernors. We are following the admonition of the 10th amendment of the \nConstitution, part of the Bill of Rights, 28 words in length, that \nsays, in effect, if the power is not reserved to the Federal Government \nit belongs to the States and to the people. We believe when the people \ngave us a majority last November, they wanted us to give power back to \nthe States and back to the people.\n\n  This bill is right for senior citizens. We will save, preserve, and \nstrengthen Medicare. It will still grow at a rate of 6.4 percent. We \nbelieve that is a step in the right direction.\n  But looking at other beneficiaries, somebody who buys a home will \nsave a lot of money because interest rates will come down. If you buy a \ncar, if you are going to buy farm machinery, if you take out a loan to \nsend your child to college, or if you are trapped in a failed welfare \nsystem--not anyone in this body would say we do not have a failed \nwelfare system.\n  It seems to me that if we are going to promise to end business as \nusual, we have to start putting up or shutting up. We cannot do all of \nthe things that my colleagues on the other side say--keep spending more \nmoney, spending more money, more taxes, more regulations, more \ngovernment--and ever make a fundamental shift in America.\n  I hope, again, knowing the bill is going to be vetoed, but I hope the \nAmerican people know that we are not going to mortgage their future \nwith this bill; that we are going to cut taxes for families with \nchildren; we are going to encourage savings and investment and economic \ngrowth. We have kept our promise. We kept our promise to shift power \nout of Washington, DC, to the States, and we have kept our promise \nthere.\n  I just conclude, because I know there are some of us going to another \ndebate, and some are getting nervous, which is all right with me, but I \nsimply ask the President of the United States to take another look at \nthis product. This is a good product, Mr. President. You ought to sign \nit. You ought to make up for all the things you have done wrong in the \npast 3 years and sign this bill. Then you would be right on target \nagain. You would be that new Democrat you wanted to be or thought you \nwere or might have been.\n  Mr. President, we are doing the right thing. We are doing it because \nwe stuck together, because we kept our promise, and because we love \nAmerica.\n  Mr. President, soon after my election to the Kansas State House of \nRepresentatives, a reporter asked me whether I had a legislative \nagenda. And I replied that my agenda was simple--it was to stand up for \nwhat I thought was right.\n  And I have tried to follow that philosophy throughout my career.\n  In just a few minutes I will vote to approve the Balanced Budget Act \nof 1995.\n  I believe the vote is one of the most historic votes ever taken in \nthis Chamber--and certainly the most important one I have cast in my \nyears in the Senate.\n  And as I cast my vote to approve this landmark legislation, I can say \nthat I have never been so certain that I am standing up for what's \nright.\n  I have never been so certain that the U.S. Senate is standing up for \nwhat is right.\n  Mr. President, the Balanced Budget Amendment Act of 1995 is right for \nAmerica's future.\n  It is right for the American people.\n  It is right for our children and grandchildren.\n  It is right for our States, our cities, and our neighborhoods.\n  It is right for our senior citizens.\n  It is right for every American who is saving to buy a home.\n  It is right for every American who is buying a car.\n  It is right for every American who takes out a loan to send a child \nto college.\n  It is right for those trapped in our failed welfare system.\n  Mr. President, last fall, Republicans asked voters to give us a \nmajority on Capitol Hill. And we left absolutely no doubt about what we \nwould do if we got that majority.\n  We promised we would put an end to business as usual. Tonight, \nAmericans know that we have kept our promise.\n  We promised to stop the mortgaging of our children's and \ngrandchildren's future, and to put America on a path to a balanced \nbudget. Tonight, Americans know that we have kept our promise.\n  We promised to replace our failed welfare system with one based on \nthe principles of work, family, and personal responsibility. Tonight, \nAmericans know that we have kept our promise.\n  We promised to cut taxes for America's families, and to encourage \nsavings, investment, and economic growth. Tonight, Americans know that \nwe have kept our promise.\n  We promised to shift power out of Washington, DC, and to return it to \nwhere it belongs--our States, our cities, and our people. And tonight \nAmericans know that we have kept our promise.\n  A balanced budget. True welfare reform. Lower taxes. More freedom and \npower for our States, our cities, and our people. That's what \nRepublicans are all about. And that's what this bill is all about.\n  President Clinton has said that he will veto this bill. He will, as \nis his habit, stand in the way of change. And I would simply say to the \nPresident to take another look at this bill.\n  We are told that the President's pollsters are advising him that the \nAmerican people have concluded that his actions don't match his words. \nBy signing this bill, President Clinton would prove that his actions do \nmatch his words on a number of issues.\n  President Clinton has told the American people many, many times that \nhe is for a balanced budget.\n  He said on June 4, 1992 he would balance the budget in 5 years.\n  He said on May 20, 1995, he could balance the budget in less than 10 \nyears.\n  He said on June 13, 1995, he would take 10 years.\n  And on October 19, 1995 he said he could balance it in either 7 \nyears, 8 years, or 9 years.\n  Despite these claims, President Clinton did everything he could to \ndefeat a balanced budget amendment, and the Congressional Budget \nOffice-- which the President has previously endorsed as an honest \nscorekeeper--has said that the budgets the President did propose left \nus with $200 million in deficits far into the next century.\n  President Clinton said in 1992 that he would end welfare as we know \nit. Yet, he admitted recently that the only welfare bill he proposed \nwas a disappointment.\n  The President promised in 1992 that he would give middle-class \nAmericans a tax cut. Yet, in 1993 he gave America the largest tax \nincrease in history.\n  The President said that he wants to prevent Medicare from going \nbankrupt, as three of his Cabinet members have projected it will do \nwithin 7 years. Yet, he has refused to work in a bi-partisan manner \nwith Republicans to save Medicare. Instead, according to a remarkable \neditorial in the Washington Post, the President has ``shamelessly used \nthe Medicare issue * * * demagogued on it * * * and taken to the \nairwaves with a slick scare program.''\n  So, Americans have every reason to be confused. Just where does the \nPresident stand on balancing the budget? Where does he stand on \nreforming welfare? Where does he stand on cutting \n\n[[Page S 17330]]\ntaxes for America's families? Where does he stand on saving Medicare?\n  The President's decision on this bill will, once and for all, clear \nup all confusion. Because by signing this bill, the President will \nfinally allow his actions to match his words. But by vetoing it, he \nwill make very clear that he is against a balanced budget, and the \nbenefits it will bring. He is against welfare reform. He is against tax \nreduction. He is against saving Medicare.\n  And by vetoing this bill, the President will be against many other \nprovisions. He will be against a capital gains tax cut. He will be \nagainst putting an end to the marriage penalty tax. He will be against \nmedical savings accounts. He will be against adoption tax credits. He \nwill be against helping Americans who provide care to their parents.\n  Now, when President Clinton vetoes this bill, he will shake his head, \nand he will say what many of his liberal allies have said today. He \nwill say that he would like to sign this bill, but it's just too harsh. \nHe will say that we are cutting spending on programs for the less \nfortunate among us. He will say we are cutting Medicare. He will say \nour tax cuts favor the business community.\n  He will say all that again and again. And he will be wrong every time \nhe says it.\n  He will be wrong because this bill does not cut overall Federal \nspending--it allows it to grow by 22 percent over the next 7 years.\n  He will be wrong because this bill does not cut Medicare. In fact, \nMedicare will continue to grow at a rate of 7.7 percent a year.\n  He will be wrong because this bill does not cut programs to the \nneedy--it allows 34 percent growth over the next 7 years.\n  He will be wrong because total funding for student loans will be \nincreased by nearly 50 percent over the next 7 years.\n  He will be wrong because 73 percent of the tax cuts in this bill will \nhelp families throughout their lives.\n  Those are the facts. The President will try his best to obscure these \nfacts with emotional rhetoric. In fact, the Democrat National Committee \nalready has a television commercial on the air trumpeting the \nPresident's so-called balanced budget proposal, and saying that the \nRepublican plan will cut Medicare.\n  It's a nice commercial with catchy music, but not a word of it is \ntrue. As I have said, the President has never submitted a budget \nanywhere near balance. And the Republican plan increases Medicare \nspending.\n  Mr. President, I'm from a farm State, and I want to say to the \nfarmers of Kansas and the farmers of America that this bill is also \nimportant to them.\n  Since the days of Franklin Roosevelt, the Government has been in the \nbusiness of telling farmers how to farm. Under this bill, that will \nend, and beginning in 1996, farmers will be planting for the market \nplace.\n  Under this bill, farmers will have full planting flexibility, \nelimination of set-asides, program simplicity, and a farm policy that \ntransitions farmers into the next century without disrupting the farm \neconomy or land values.\n  While I am concerned about farmers receiving payments in good years, \nI am pleased we were able to cap the entitlement spending of \nagriculture programs. We accomplish this goal through a declining \ntransition payment which is guaranteed to the farmer. In exchange, \nfarmers will be required to maintain their land conservation efforts in \nboth good and bad years. And this bill also protects family farms by \nproviding some much needed estate tax relief.\n  Mr. President, let me conclude by saying that I know that the \nAmerican people have wondered about the events taking place in \nWashington this week. They have wondered why the Government was shut \ndown. They have wondered why Congress and the White House aren't \ntalking to each other.\n  Well, as I have said many times this week, I wonder why we haven't \nspent more time talking to each other. And I remain ready to talk with \nthe President any time to put all Federal employees back to work.\n  But I also would tell Americans that if ever there was a debate you \nwanted your elected Representatives to have, this is it. This is it. \nBecause we are debating your future. We are debating the future of your \nchildren and grandchildren. We are debating the future of America.\n  I speak for all Republicans in saying that, as we approach \nThanksgiving, we are thankful to have the opportunity to stand for \nsomething.\n  We are thankful to have the opportunity to stand for fundamental \nchange.\n  We are thankful to have the opportunity to stand for a better future \nfor the next generation of Americans.\n  And let me close by saying--and I know I speak for all Members of the \nSenate--that we are thankful that we have the opportunity to serve with \na Senator as courageous and committed as Pete Domenici, and I salute \nhim for his many years of leadership in support of a balanced budget.\n  Mr. President, let's do the right thing for America's future. Let's \npass the Balanced Budget Act of 1995.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader is informed the yeas and \nnays have not been ordered.\n  Mr. DOLE.

Who yields \ntime?\n  Mr. EXON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, I yield myself 5 minutes off the time that I \nhave under my control, and will the Chair advise me how much time the \nSenator from Nebraska controls?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska controls 30 minutes.\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, I have been fascinated and horrified by the \npress reports about the horse trading that went on to win the support \nfor the Republican budget. I am not speaking about wooing recalcitrant \nRepublicans who strayed from the party line. No, I am looking at some \nof the sweeteners that were loaded into this bill to keep the medical \nestablishment at bay and to pay the American Medical Association for \ntheir support of the Republican budget.\n  This conference report is groaning with extraneous giveaways to the \nmedical establishment. They do not only violate the Byrd rule, but they \nviolate every sense of decency and fair play. The conference report \nexempts physicians' offices and laboratories from the Clinical \nLaboratory and Improvement Act of 1988.\n  It is clear that this is a violation of the Budget Act. It is \nextraneous, in addition to being bad policy. Antitrust regulations are \nturned on their heads in this conference report just to boost \nphysicians' salaries. The conference report exempts certain groups of \nhealth care providers from the most basic antitrust violations against \nprice fixing. This is also a violation of the Budget Act and is likely \nto impair competition and raise costs for non-Medicare health care \npurchasers.\n  It is appalling that when our seniors, our poor, our disabled, and \nour children are being asked to sacrifice basic health care, the \nRepublicans are trying to enlarge special interest giveaways to the \nNation's physicians.\n  The provisions do not belong in this fast-track reconciliation bill \nand are a violation of the Byrd rule. I urge my colleagues to vote \nagainst the motion to waive this well-founded point of order.\n  Madam President, at this time, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Hutchison). Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. EXON. Madam President, I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. EXON. Madam President, since there are no other Members seeking \nrecognition at this time, I yield 5 minutes of my time to the Senator \nfrom Arkansas.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Madam President, it is not unusual when I go home and \nvisit with some of my wealthy friends--and I do have some wealthy \nfriends--they say, ``The only objection I have to you Democrats is you \nare constantly engaging in class warfare. You are always talking about \nthe wealthy.''\n  I repudiate that idea, but I would like for my colleagues to look at \nthis chart for just a minute. This is a quote from David Gergen--one of \nRonald Reagan's right-hand men when he was President--from an op-ed \npiece that he wrote in this week's U.S. News and World Report. Without \nstraining your eyes, I will tell you what he said about this bill we \nare debating tonight. Eighty percent of the tax breaks in this bill go \nto the wealthiest 20 percent of Americans. Eighty percent of the \nspending cut burden goes to the poorest 20 percent. Now, you talk about \nclass warfare. There is class warfare. It violates every principle I \never learned as a Methodist Sunday school boy. It violates every \nprinciple I have ever held dear, and the very reason I came to the U.S. \nSenate. Madam President, let me say something about the wealthy people \nof this country. They do not like this. Seventy percent of the people \nof this country say they do not want a tax cut until the budget is \nbalanced. Why are we going against what 70 percent of the people say?\n  Last fall, when people were voting, Madam President, most did not \nhave a clue what was in the Contract With America. And I can assure you \nthey were not voting for this. They were not voting to penalize the \npoorest 20 percent of the people in America. They were not in favor of \ndepriving a million children in this country of an education. They were \nnot voting to put another million people in poverty, which this bill \ndoes. They were not voting to cut school lunches, which is the only \ndecent meal an awful lot of children in this country get. They were not \nvoting to savage Medicare and make the elderly people of this country \npay it. They were not voting to savage Medicaid. In my State, Medicaid \nwill be cut 33 percent, Madam President. We will not have a Medicaid \nprogram.\n  The people of America were not voting to slash the Earned Income Tax \nCredit for people who are trying to work and stay off welfare. What are \nwe doing? We are cutting that $32 billion.\n  So I remind my colleagues on the other side of the aisle, when the \nAmerican family gathers around the dinner table in the evening, what do \nthey talk about? What do they say they love? Not the Mercedes in the \ndriveway. Not that posh office downtown or that magnificent farm out \nback. They love their children. That is who they want us to protect. \nWhat are we doing? We are savaging the children of this country. For \nwhat? So that the biggest corporations in America get a break. I yield \nthe floor.\n  Mr. HATCH. Madam President, we are trying to accommodate Members \naround here. And there is no use kidding, I am very upset about this \npoint of order. This is not going to be the last time we mention it \neither. But I want to accommodate everybody around here. We ought to \nhave at least a 2-hour debate on the thing because it is not easy to \nexplain, but it is easy to understand. I have to tell you that I think \neven my colleagues on the other side might understand. But the fact of \nthe matter is that this point of order is wrong. I personally feel very \nbadly about it because what we are doing here is we are allowing the \nrule of reason in some areas and not allowing it in others. It is very \nunfair, it does not work right. We are happy to enhance bureaucracy but \nwe are not happy to enhance individuality. I think we can clarify it \nfor anybody in just a few minutes. But we want to accommodate those who \nwant to get out of here and, frankly, I think we can put a lot of what \nwe have to say into the Record.\n  Let me address this point of order against antitrust rules relating \nto provider-sponsored organizations--PSO's, if you will--and health \ncare groups \n\n[[Page S 17317]]\nthat contract with them to provide Medicare services. These provisions \nwould grant antitrust relief to these two different entities by \nsubjecting their conduct to the rule of reason, rather than the per se \nillegal rule.\n  Let me be clear about what this language would do. This is not an \nantitrust exemption. Under the rule of reason, the conduct of the PSO's \nand their subcontracting health care groups will not be legal if it is \ndesigned to fix prices, divide markets, or exclude competitors. \nInstead, their conduct will be illegal if it is anticompetitive, but if \nit is competitive, leads to efficiency, and produces lower prices for \nhealth care, it will survive antitrust challenge, as it should.\n  This provision that we are about to strike out of here is one of the \nfew that really saves an awful lot of money in health care and flies in \nthe face of bureaucratizing the process, which I thought we defeated \nlast year. We believe that this reform--which is necessary only because \nthe Department of Justice and the Federal Trade Commission have \noverzealously enforced the antitrust laws--is central to the savings we \nanticipate in our Medicare reforms. Right now, because of these \nenforcement policies, groups of doctors cannot form, decide on a fee \nschedule, and negotiate with anyone over providing health care \nservices, if this is knocked out. This knocks out of the market a \npotentially new class of competitors with low overhead and little or no \nbureaucracy, who can make these other groups bring prices down.\n  The Congressional Budget Office scored the savings to be generated by \nthe House and Senate Medicare reform bills at between $34.2 billion and \n$50.4 billion over 7 years.\n  CBO did not break out how much of this savings was attributable to \nthe creation of health care provider groups that could contract with \nPSO's, and the importance of the antitrust reform needed to encourage \nthe groups to form. The CBO noted the creation of PSO's in these groups \nwould have an impact on Medicare outlays and that is all that is needed \nto meet the express language of the Byrd rule.\n  Further, since this bill is creating two whole new classes of \ncompetitors in the Medicare market, and the antitrust provisions are \ncritical to encouraging their formation, it is clear that these \nprovisions are critical to producing the billions of dollars in savings \nwe are counting on for innovation and competition. I do not think that \nanyone can seriously contend that these provisions have no budgetary \nimpact.\n  The second argument that one might raise against these provisions is \nthat they are somehow incidental to reconciliation. This aspect of the \nByrd rule is designed to prevent the addition of provisions that have \nnothing to do with the budget. The antitrust provisions clearly satisfy \nthe Byrd rule. The rule has nothing to do with the larger changes in \nall antitrust law.\n  In fact, it does not change antitrust law at all, only the \nadministration's enforcement. More importantly, the antitrust \nprovisions are expressly limited only to conduct that is necessary to \nprovide health care services under Medicare contract or plan. It has no \napplication outside of the Medicare context, and any attempt to use \ninformation gained in Medicare context beyond the limits of that \nprogram--what some people call a leakage or seepage problem--would be \nillegal. Any conduct occurring in the Medicare context that is just a \nsham for price fixing or boycotting would still be illegal under the \nrule of reason.\n  I suggest that those who would use the Byrd rule to stop these \nprovisions are not concerned, Madam President, about budgetary impact \nor incidental provisions. Instead, they are interested in suppressing \ncompetition in the health care market and reducing Medicare costs.\n  We should be frank. The status quo helps large hospitals and \ninsurance companies and HMO's. These antitrust provisions that are in \nthis bill that they are trying to rule out of order may cut down on \ntheir profit margins by introducing whole new classes of health care \nproviders into the marketplace. New market actors will spur competition \nefficiency and lower costs.\n  When we are fighting to find ways to reduce Government costs and the \nGovernment's tax burden, why turn away an attractive mechanism to make \nthe markets work better and to reduce the budget?\n\n  The fact is per se illegal activity will still be illegal. These \nentities would have to live within the rule of reason. If they do not \nand they do not increase competition, increase efficiency, and reduce \ncosts, then they are not going to be able to function, and they should \nnot be.\n  The fact of the matter is that this point of order is wrong, and I \nhope that we will vote to waive the point of order.\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, I yield 3 minutes to the Senator from \nFlorida.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Thank you, Madam President.\n  As I read the front cover of the document which has just been \npresented to us, Balanced Budget Act of 1995, Part 1 of 2--Part 2 \napparently has not yet arrived--the question arises, why will I vote \nagainst this proposition?\n  It is not, Madam President, because I am opposed to a balanced \nbudget. I am, in fact, strongly supportive of a balanced budget, and \nevery occasion I have had an opportunity to advance that cause I have \ndone so.\n  I frankly commend the Republicans for having presented us an \nalternative which purports to achieve that goal of balanced budget \nbecause it will provide a significant point of debate and dialog as to \nhow to achieve that goal.\n  However, Madam President, I do not feel that this legislation \npresented tonight will accomplish the objective of balanced budget for \ntwo primary reasons. One, just as in foreign policy, I do not believe \nthis Nation can achieve an important long-term domestic policy goal \nunless that goal is broadly shared, unless there is bipartisan support.\n  The fact is, there is no bipartisan support for this provision. There \nhas been no attempt to secure bipartisan support. No Democrats were \nsanctioned into the conferences which led to the production of this \nlegislation. No Democratic ideas were solicited for inclusion.\n  Second, this will not achieve the goal of a balanced budget over the \nnext 7 years because it is fundamentally unfair and will soon be seen \nto be unfair by the American people and rejected.\n  I am going to concentrate my comments on fairness on only one section \nof this multihundred-page bill, Part 1 of 2, goes to 966 pages. That is \nthe sections that relate to Medicaid.\n  First, the statement is made that this legislation reduces Medicaid \nspending by $163 billion over the next 7 years. Madam President, that \nis not true. In fact, this legislation reduces Medicaid spending by \nalmost $400 billion over the next 7 years.\n  What is the difference? The difference is because this legislation \nremoves virtually all of the current requirements on States to make a \nsignificant contribution towards the health of their poor, their \ndisabled and their frail elderly.\n  Second, this allows for future manipulation of the Medicaid Program. \nWe worked hard in this Senate to eliminate the abuses that had become \nso rampant in the disproportionate share hospital program. This \nlegislation allows all those abuses to return. This legislation, in \nfact, rewards those very States that have been the principal abusers of \nthe disproportionate share program.\n  Madam President, for those and many other reasons that we will find \nin these 966 pages, this proposal fails to meet the duel test of \nbipartisanship and fairness necessary for its sustained achievement of \nthe goal of the balanced budget.\n  Madam President, we are here debating a bill that nobody has \nreceived. Even for those who may have a copy, it would be impossible \nfor them to have possibly read the legislation from cover to cover.\n  And yet, this is one of the most significant bills to come before the \nCongress. This is a bill that makes up to $1 trillion in reductions to \nour Nation's budget--including $256 billion in Medicare reductions and \n$163.5 billion in Medicaid reductions--over the next 7 years.\n  I rise today to speak to the best of my knowledge about some of the \nprovisions in this bill. Of course, the ``best of my knowledge'' is \nlimited by the amount of information we have managed to obtain, some of \nwhich our office has had to get from lobbyists who always seem to get \nsuch materials before the rest of the Congress.\n\n[[Page S 17318]]\n\n  Due to time limitations, I will focus on the massive reductions or \n$420 billion in Federal cuts that will be made in this bill to our \nNation's Medicare and Medicaid programs which are integral parts of our \nNation's health infrastructure.\n\n\n       medicaid cuts even higher due to state-federal combination\n\n  The first point that has been neglected about this budget deal are \nthat the real Medicaid reductions are more in the neighborhood of $400 \nbillion over the next 7 years. Part of this figure comes from the \n$163.5 billion in Federal reductions to Medicaid. However, an often \noverlooked but just as significant provision is the language in the \nbill that guts the matching rate requirements of States.\n  This reduction will have the effect of reducing another $200-plus \nbillion in State funding over the next 7 years to the Medicaid program.\n  How does this work? At present, States such as New York have to match \na Federal Medicaid dollar with a State Medicaid dollar. No longer. \nAccording to the revised State matching requirements, New York would be \nallowed to match a Federal Medicaid dollar with just 67 cents--a 33-\npercent reduction.\n  The effect of the change to the matching rates across the Nation will \nbe a $200-plus billion reduction in State funding to Medicaid.\n  Moreover, the conference agreement eliminates two provisions in the \nSenate bill that were agreed to unanimously in the Senate Finance \nCommittee. These amendments would have continued to prohibit the gaming \nof the Medicaid System through the use of provider taxes and prohibited \nStates from supplanting current State health expenditures with Medicaid \ndollars.\n  The conference committee agreement encourages States to go back to \nthe days of fictitious accounting and gaming that in the past \neffectively raided the Medicaid Program.\n  The effect of this policy under a block grant is not to raid the \nFederal treasury but to make the State matching rate illusory at best. \nIn fact, the conference report effectively makes Medicaid a general \nrevenue sharing program.\n  It is no wonder that some of our Nation's Governors are clamoring and \ncheerleading the destruction of the Medicaid Program. I have a warning \nfor them, or more accurately, a proverb for them. The proverb goes as \nfollows: ``Fish see the worm not the hook.''\n  The Governors who are anxious to gobble up these block grants and \nillusory matching rates will feel took in the future when their \neconomies stumble, when an epidemic strikes, when a nature disaster \nhits, when inflation creeps up again, or when their populations grow.\n\n\n                  Nation's Low-Income Elderly At Risk\n\n  Another often misunderstood provision of this legislation is the \nimpact that it will have on our Nation's low-income elderly.\n  Let me emphasize that the Republican bill repeals the current law \nguarantee of payment of the Medicare Part B premiums on behalf of \nelderly Americans with income below the poverty level--$622 per month \nfor an individual.\n  Although the Speaker of the House claims the bill ``provides that \nsenior citizens at the poverty level and below have all of their Part B \npremium paid for by the taxpayers--100 percent,'' the fact is that, no \npoor senior citizen has a guarantee to any coverage or assistance \nwhatsoever.\n  States would be asked to set aside a certain percentage of their \nprogram spending each year to pay for Medicare premiums, deductibles, \nand coinsurance on behalf of low-income elderly. However, this set-\naside will be sufficient to cover only about 44 percent of the costs of \nPart B premiums for those now eligible by the year 2002.\n\n\n                  Nursing Home--Liens of Family Homes\n\n  Another provision that was unanimously agreed to in the Senate \nFinance Committee was a provision that protected spouses having liens \nplaced against their home or family farm. Incredibly, this provision \nwas also dropped by the conference committee.\n  As a result, the conference agreement repeals current law protections \nagainst the use of liens and expressly authorizes States to impose \nliens on the home or family farm of a beneficiary, even when the spouse \nis still living in it.\n\n\n                unfairness of medicaid cuts and formula\n\n  Finally, I want to raise some policy questions that the bill creates. \nFirst what is the policy justification for $163.5 billion in Medicaid \nreductions? This provides for just a 1.9 percent increase in Medicaid \nspending per person over the seven year period and is far less than the \n7.1 percent the Congressional Budget Office projects private sector \nspending to increase.\n  Second, what is the policy justification for arriving at the Medicaid \nformula in the bill? Can anybody possibly explain how the fiscal year \n1996 State-by-State allocations are arrived at? Dollar figures are \nstated in law. How were those numbers arrived at?\n  Clearly, one impact is to reward those States that have extremely \nhigh share of disproportionate share in the past. Some of those States \nabused the Medicaid Program and will be rewarded for that abuse in the \nnew Medicaid formula.\n  At one point, the Senate Finance Committee staff had proposed that \nStates with excessive disproportionate share payments would lose those \nexcess payments. The Senate Finance Committee voted to cap those \npayments at 12 percent.\n  That provision was deleted, and instead, States are now rewarded for \ntheir excesses and--in some cases--their abuse.\n  These States will have those funds permanently cemented in their base \nallocation and allowed to increase them well into the future. What is \nthe policy rationale for this?\n  Whatever the rationale, the effect is to apportion funding in a \nmanner that is fundamentally unfair to those States that did not scam \nthe Medicaid disproportionate share program, those States that are \ngrowing and those States that have been efficient in the past.\n  In Florida's case, we have a larger population than either \nPennsylvania and Ohio and an elderly population that is 40.7 percent \ngreater than Pennsylvania and 79.2 percent greater than Ohio, yet will \nreceive less money over the next 7 years from Medicaid than either of \nthose two States.\n  Florida has 5.4 percent of the Nation's population, 8 percent of the \nNation's elderly population but will receive just 4.2 percent of the \noverall Federal Medicaid allocation between fiscal year 1996 and 2002.\n  If Florida were to just receive its population share of money, it \nwould receive $42.7 billion instead of the $33.0 billion allowed in \nthis bill, a $9.7 billion disparity or loss to Florida over the 7-year \nperiod.\n\n\n                             other problems\n\n  For all these reasons and for numerous others--such as the conference \ncommittee's level of Medicare cuts on our Nation's elderly and the \ndanger and exposure that Medicare beneficiaries will be subjected to \ndue to watered down emergency care managed care standards, I cannot and \nwill not support this legislation.\n  I would like to turn the Senate's attention from Medicaid and \nMedicare for a moment to another important issue before the Senate \ntonight.\n  Madam President, when the Senate votes on the reconciliation bill \nshortly, there will be one important issue which risks being lost in \nthe enormity of the Medicare cutting, Medicaid gutting, tax cutting, \nand budget balancing package.\n  That issue is welfare reform.\n  The effrontery of burying such a monumentally important matter in the \nmiddle of a massive Medicare, Medicaid, Tax Code, and budget overhaul \nspeaks for itself.\n  The welfare reform component of this reconciliation bill deserves \nstrict scrutiny instead of token consideration.\n  My support for sweeping change in our Nation's welfare system is a \nmatter of record, and as recently as September 19, 1995, I joined with \n86 of my colleagues in supporting the Work Opportunity Act of 1995, \nSenate bill 1120.\n  I voted in support of this bill, even though I had serious \nreservations, in order to keep the welfare reform effort in this \nCongress alive.\n  Unfortunately, the conference agreement moves welfare reform in the \nopposite direction. The pending legislation is worse than what we had \nto consider 2 months ago.\n  Madam President, I support welfare reform. I want to see Congress \npass a welfare reform measure, and I want to \n\n[[Page S 17319]]\nsee the President sign welfare reform legislation. But this bill \ndeserves neither.\n  Welfare reform, when it is done well, works and works well.\n  Florida boasts of two very successful welfare pilot projects, the \nlargest in America in instituting a ``time limited benefit.'' Florida, \nin fact, has been one of the pioneers in the ``two years and you are \nout'' approach that is mirrored in the pending legislation.\n  But, Madam President, these pilots are succeeding because there is a \nfront-end investment in the lives of those affected by the program \nchange.\n  Whether it is day care, job training, temporary transportation \nassistance, or health care, the welfare recipient is given a hand up \ninstead of a hand out.\n  I visited the program in Pensacola, FL. Earlier this year President \nClinton met some of the participants that I met, and he touted the \nprogram.\n  Madam President, the conference agreement before the Senate, as it \npertains to welfare reform, is a mixture of good news and bad news.\n  The good news is that the conference agreement no longer treat \neducation as welfare. We have Congressman Clay Shaw and others to thank \nfor that improvement.\n  Thankfully, the welfare reform legislation no longer kicks legal \nimmigrants who pay taxes and are eligible for Federal student loans or \ngrants, out of school.\n  This change assures 21,000 students in universities, colleges, and \ncommunity colleges in Florida that they can continue to study and train \nin order to provide for their families and enhance our Nation's \nproductivity.\n  Further, the conference agreement renounces the previous position of \nthe Senate where deeming would occur past the date of citizenship. That \nprovision appeared unconstitutional on its face, and fortunately, it \nwas dropped.\n  But, Madam President, I am sorry to report that there is an \noverwhelming amount of bad news emerging from the conference on welfare \nreform.\n  First, the formula to allocate funds to the States continues welfare \nas we knew it. It treats poor children differently, depending upon \nwhich State they live in.\n\n  The conference formula says that if your State spent a lot in the old \ndays, and thus built incentives to keep people on welfare, you will be \ngiven a leg up on every other State under block grants.\n  That is how it is possible, for example, that the State of Michigan \nwould be given $217 million more, each year, than the State of Florida, \nwhich has a population that is 4.5 million greater than Michigan's \npopulation.\n  The conclusion is simple: the formula adopted by the conferees is \nflawed, if not rigged.\n  The conferees had an option: adopt a fair share allocation which \ntreats children the same regardless of their ZIP codes. I offered such \nan amendment 2 months ago.\n  Instead, the conferees chose to reward the big spenders who got us in \nthis mess in the first place.\n  If parents rewarded bad behavior of their children like this, we \nwould be a nation of reform schools.\n  Madam President, another glaring disappointment in the conference \nagreement before the Senate is the retreat on a commitment to funding \nchild care.\n  The Senate voted for a $3 billion increase over 5 years and now we \nsee that the conference agreement proposes $3 billion over 7 years.\n  That may sound like an innocuous accounting change until you look at \nthe impact on the States.\n  That change means for Florida less child care money next year, I \nrepeat, less money next year, than it had this year.\n  Keep in mind that Florida is expected to more than double in one year \nits population of welfare recipients in the work force.\n  The conference agreement short-changes Florida $18 million in child \ncare funds from the amount that passed the Senate in September. That is \nmovement backward, not forward.\n  When you take the faulty funding formula for the block grants, and \ncombine them with the paltry child care allocations, you get the \ngrowing sense that Florida has been set up to fail.\n  Madam President, it did not have to be this way. If government were \nrun like a business, you would have had by now a debate about a \nbusiness plan.\n  In effect, you would have identified outcomes to be achieved, and \nthen identified the means necessary to achieve those outcomes.\n  Just in the area of child care alone, in order to meet the job \nrequirements of the conference agreement for the first 5 years after \nenactment, Florida would need approximately $800 million in child care \nfunding. The conference agreement gives Florida $509 million.\n  That $291 million shortfall means that tens of thousands of children \ncan not get child care, and therefore, their mothers or fathers can't \ngo to work.\n  But the Congress wasn't interested in outcome and resource analysis. \nThe Congress didn't want to do a business plan.\n  The Congress wanted to cut tens of billions of dollars out of welfare \nand shift those burdens to the States.\n  I will highlight a few more disappointments.\n  The Senate placed $878 million in a growth fund to assist States \nwhich experience caseload increases, and thus, cost increases. The \nconference agreement reduces that about 10 percent.\n  I mentioned earlier that there was good news in the conference \nagreement as it pertains to legal immigrants and access to Federal \nassistance to higher educational programs.\n  But even that good news has a new catch. The conferees have set up a \nnew class system now in the Stafford loans program. Now legal immigrant \napplicants must have a sponsor or other citizen cosign the loans.\n\n  No debate on this change. No hearings. A brand new provision written \nin conference.\n  So I am left to believe that the conferees felt that only the better \noff of the legal immigrant communities are eligible for a Federal loan \nprogram, even though they all pay taxes like citizens pay taxes. So \nmuch for the American dream.\n  The city of Miami had more legal immigrants admitted last year than \n20 States combined did. Thus the prohibitions and timetables on certain \nbenefits will shift to Miami costs that once were shared or born by the \nFederal Government.\n  The State of Florida does not set immigration policy. The State of \nFlorida did not negotiate a 20,000 legal immigrants per year agreement \nbetween Cuba and the United States.\n  But the State of Florida is now being told the following: first, we \nare going to cheat you on the block grant, and give States like New \nYork more than four times what you get.\n  Second, we are going to cut child care for your State, and leave you \n$300 million below what you need to achieve the work participation \nrates that we intend to grade you on.\n  Finally, we are going to stick you with hundreds of millions of \ndollars in costs for legal and illegal immigration, even though you \nhave no control over those policies.\n  How is that for fairness? How is that for reasonableness?\n  Madam President, I am disappointed with the direction the welfare \nreform measure went after it left the Senate. It has taken a turn for \nthe worse. For the State of Florida, a State which did not have a high \nwelfare benefit check and thus did not contribute as greatly to the \nwelfare culture as those States who now reap windfalls for having \ncreated the problem, the conference agreement is not acceptable.\n  I urge the President to veto this bill and for both sides to begin to \nwork together immediately toward reaching a consensus plan on balancing \nthe Nation's budget. There is another way.\n  Mr. KYL. Madam President, let me get back to the issue before us, \nwhich is the objection to the point of order that has been made to \ncertain provisions of this bill.\n  Madam President, we ought not to waive this provision. We should not \nhave to waive the provision because there is nothing violative of the \nByrd rule in the antitrust provisions of the Medicare part of the \nBalanced Budget Act of 1995.\n  Let me go back a little bit to set the stage here. The whole theory \nof our Medicare reform, how we are beginning to strengthen Medicare and \nsave it from bankruptcy, is to create more choices in the marketplace \nso that competition will drive costs down while also ensuring quality \nof care.\n  Now, in order to create those choices, we allowed for the creation of \na couple \n\n[[Page S 17320]]\nof new products in this legislation. One of the products is the medical \nsavings account whereby people would have an incentive not to spend all \nof the deductible amount that they did not have to spend, and we \nprovided that tax free.\n  As a result of a Byrd problem on that provision, the inside buildup--\nthat is to say, the part that you do not spend--is now going to be \ntaxed.\n  One of the products is not going to be nearly as attractive as it was \nwhen we wrote our bill.\n  The other new product is the hospital and physician organization, a \nnew type of entity, somewhat similar to an HMO, but not really the same \nbecause here instead of having an insurance company or some kind of \nadministrative organization that runs the whole program you simply have \nphysicians and hospitals in a community getting together to offer their \nservices on a capitated basis for the people who would be eligible for \nMedicare benefits.\n  It is believed the creation of these organizations by cutting out the \nmiddleman and creating a new product would, in fact, create that kind \nof choice and therefore the competition in the marketplace would cause \ncosts to be reduced.\n  The two products, together, along with existing Medicare and the HMO \noption that currently exists would therefore create lower costs, thus \nallowing us to save the $270 billion over the 7 years that is needed in \norder to prevent the bankruptcy of the system.\n  Madam President, as I said, the medical savings account part of this \nis now jeopardized because of the Byrd rule. If we also cripple the \nphysician-hospital organizations because of the Byrd rule, we will have \nlargely failed to create the two new products and therefore the \ncompetition, the choice, and the competition in this, and I fear, Madam \nPresident, that our entire Medicare reform will fail. And the \ncommitment that we have made to our seniors, as a result of the \nDemocrats raising the objection here, will cause our Medicare reform to \nfail.\n\n  Madam President, I will say this as clearly as I can. If and when \nthat happens, the American people, and in particular the seniors of \nthis country, ought to know precisely where the blame lies. Because we \nhave an opportunity this evening to save the Medicare system. But if \npeople do not vote down this point of order, it is in serious jeopardy \nof going bankrupt because our system will not have within it the two \nkey products that would be created to create this competition and \nchoice.\n  What exactly happens here? Why are we so concerned about this? For \nthe doctors and the hospitals to get together to create this kind of \norganization, they have to talk to each other and they have to talk \nabout prices and how they are going to treat patients. When that \nhappens, lawyers are going to say, you are violating the antitrust \nlaws. Under a per se rule, which means ``in and of itself,'' that would \nbe true. The mere fact that you sit down and talk about it violates the \nlaw.\n  So we have said in here, let us substitute the rule of reason, a rule \nof antitrust law that says we will consider it under the circumstances. \nIf what they did is really wrong and violative of the antitrust laws, \nthen we are still going to prosecute them. But if, under the \ncircumstances of creating this new product, and only for the purpose of \ncontracting with Medicare, they get together and talk about these \nthings, things such as prices, then it would be OK. But the Justice \nDepartment, FTC, still would look at this under a rule of reason, as \nSenator Hatch pointed out.\n  There are two main points, and this is what I will close on. The CBO \nallegedly has not scored this--excuse me, has said it would have no \nbudgetary effect. That is not true. The CBO has never said that, so \nthat basis for a parliamentary ruling would simply be in error. Quite \nthe opposite is true with respect to the physician-hospital networks.\n  Second, the conclusion is that the antitrust provisions are merely \nincidental. In this regard, two contradictory arguments are made. One, \nthat this is such a big deal that all kinds of doctors are going to get \ntogether and fix prices and it is going to affect the market far beyond \nthe Medicare market. The other is that it is merely incidental.\n  Both cannot be true. The fact of the matter is, the antitrust \nprovisions are critical to the creation of this product. It is going to \nbe very hard for them to work without the antitrust exemption. So it is \nnot merely incidental. It is there for the sole purpose of enabling \nthese organizations to operate.\n  If they cannot operate, then the cost savings are not there because \nthey cannot compete in the marketplace, and our system is destined to \nfail. It is only for Medicare contracts.\n  Madam President, I will conclude it this way. If this provision comes \nout, if these antitrust modifications, just to the rule of reason, come \nout of the bill, then I am going to predict that this could easily \nfail. If it does, the people who vote against this this evening are the \nones who should be held responsible.\n  I hope that Democrats and Republicans alike will join us in defeating \nthis objection and in sustaining the waiver to the budget point of \norder.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I rise to support Senator Exxon's Point \nof Order that the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments [CLIA] \nrepealed in this budget reconciliation bill violates the Byrd Rule.\n  The Senate Parliamentarian has ruled that repealing CLIA violates the \nByrd Rule because it produces changes or outlays that are merely \nincidental to the nonbudgetary components of the provision. That is a \nviolation of the Byrd Rule.\n  Let me explain briefly to my colleagues what CLIA is, and why it is \nso important to me and to millions of Americans.\n  CLIA `88 set for the first time uniform quality standards for all \nclinical labs. I am proud that this law, which I authored, was passed \nwith broad bipartisan support.\n  CLIA was passed in 1988 and implemented in 1992 to address serious \nand life-threatening conditions in clinical labs.\n  To now even suggest we turn back the clock to pre-1988 will have \ndevastating results. Do we really want to:\n  Turn back to a time when tests were misread and diseases \nmisdiagnosed.\n  Turn back to the bad old days of misdiagnosis of the HIV/AIDS virus.\n  When doctors were using inferior methods of reading slides.\n  When people with the virus went undetected because the virus was \nmutating and was recognized by physicians.\n  Or turn back to a time when the lab technicians were overworked and \nundersupervised.\n  When slides were taken home.\n  When dirty labs were tolerated.\n  When lab technicians had little or no formal training, resulting in \nmany diseases going undetected.\n  My colleagues, CLIA works, CLIA saves lives. Reconciliation is not \nthe place to make such changes. I urge you to sustain this point of \norder.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, we are being asked to vote on the antitrust \nprovisions of this conference report. As I understand it, these \nprovisions would allow doctors to form Medicare provider networks--\nsimilar to existing managed care networks that are run by insurance \ncompanies--without running afoul of the per se standards of anti-trust \nlaw.\n  This provision violates the Byrd law. It is extraneous. It has no \neffect on the deficit, and therefore it does not belong in the budget \nreconciliation bill.\n  Furthermore, Madam President, this issue has just now been brought \nbefore the Senate. There was no similar provision in the Senate version \nof the reconciliation bill. There have not been hearings before the \nJudiciary Committee. And, we have not had a chance to examine the \neffects of this change in anti-trust law.\n  But, let me say that as ranking member of the Judiciary Committee, I \nwould be happy to give this matter full consideration. We should find \nout whether the change proposed here would really create more \ncompetition in the health care sector of the economy--and we should \nexamine whether this would be a benefit to rural areas of the country.\n  And, frankly, in this new health care climate, with the emphasis on \nbig insurance companies running managed care plans like HMO's, doctors \nneed some protection. I have told physicians in Delaware that I am \nwilling to help find ways to ensure that doctors can be doctors. I \nthink that if doctors ran the managed care networks, we might all be \nbetter off. If that means that we \n\n[[Page S 17321]]\nmust provide anti-trust relief, then I am willing to look closely at \nit.\n  But, I cannot support doing it here--doing it now--on a bill that is \nsupposed to reduce the deficit. Therefore, I will support stripping \nthis provision from the bill, and I will vote against the motion to \nwaive the rules for physician anti-trust relief.\n  I hope, however, that we will look at this more closely, in a more \nrational way, on another day.\n  Mr. EXON. I yield 8 minutes to the Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, the argument we have heard, \nunfortunately, is somewhat like the trial in ``Alice in Wonderland.'' \nFirst you have the sentence and then you have the trial afterward. In \nthis case--and this shows the very reason for the Byrd rule--we have \nspecial antitrust rules that are embedded in the reconciliation bill on \nbehalf of the doctors' lobby. They are significant matters. They \npropose changes in antitrust law, in the policy that competition \nprovides the best protection for consumers. I have said when you have \nthe sentence first and you have the trial after: You would think that \nif you were going to make these major antitrust rules changes--I do not \nknow, Madam President, if I am disturbing this conversation in front of \nme or not.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. LEAHY. It is a fascinating conversation, and I will probably \npause long enough to listen to it myself.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If the Senators will come to order, so we can \nhear the Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. As I was saying, we are being required to make these major \nantitrust changes without any proceedings, hearings or debate. We are \nbeing required to do it without any vote. All we hear from is, \napparently, the back room somewhere. Here some highly-paid lobby comes \nin and says, ``Whisper, whisper, whisper,'' and what comes out of that? \nWe end up with a special provision in a budget reconciliation bill. We \nhave a reconciliation bill and tucked in there are major changes in the \nantitrust law.\n  Mr. KYL. Will the Senator yield a moment?\n  Mr. LEAHY. I tried not to interrupt the Senator from Arizona before. \nLet me finish, and then I will be happy to yield for a question.\n  Mr. KYL. Thank you.\n  Mr. LEAHY. The Senate budget reconciliation bill that the Senate \npassed contained no such provision of which I am aware. The House \noriginally had two. Then they end up with one. An unnecessary and \ndangerous antitrust law change is in the conference report on budget \nreconciliation.\n  Again, I do not know where it came from. It did not come from \nhearings or debate, and it certainly did not come from any votes on the \nSenate floor. I am not aware that it came from any votes on the House \nfloor.\n  Yet in proposed new subsection (f), of proposed new section 1853 to \nthe Social Security Act, as contained in section 8001 of title 8 of the \nBudget Reconciliation Conference Report, in a special antitrust rule \nand change in our antitrust policy.\n  What it does is this: It exempts certain groups of doctors and other \nhealth care providers from the so-called per se rule against price \nfixing in our antitrust laws.\n  The conference report does omit the heading ``Special Antitrust Rule \nFor Provider Service Networks''--originally the House-passed bill \nactually had a heading and flagged the change --they took the heading \nout, but they left a rewrite of the section in. Maybe because this \nreconciliation bill is so long and filled with so many special interest \ngimmicks and gimmies and giveaways, maybe they thought that if you take \nthe headings off, people will not know they are there. But it is still \nthere as a subsection.\n  It attempts to enact a special antitrust rule for groups of health \ncare providers. It provides that the conduct of members of a group of \nhealth care providers, such as doctors, in ``negotiating, making, and \nperforming a contract--including the establishment and modification of \nfee schedule--'' with a provider-sponsored organization for services \nunder a MedicarePlus plan cannot be subject to the per se rule against \nprice fixing.\n  Basically, it says, go ahead and agree on whatever you want because \nwe will make it harder for anyone to prove that you are violating the \nantitrust laws. You are on your own.\n  Instead of the per se rule that is usually applied to stop price \nfixing, the only antitrust rule that can be applied is to consider and \ntest the conduct based on its ``reasonableness, taking into account all \nrelevant factors affecting competition, in properly defined markets''.\n  This is changing one of the most basic rules of antitrust law, \nchanging it in a little special gimmie or giveaway provision, tucked in \nthe reconciliation bill for whatever special interest wrote it. It \nchanges the rule from the one that applies to competitors throughout \nthe rest of the economy and that works to protect competition and \nconsumers.\n  The antitrust law treats a very limited category of conduct as per se \nunlawful. That is reserved for naked restraints, that is, those that \nare inherently harmful to competition without conferring offsetting \nbenefits. The classic example, Madam President, I say to my colleagues, \nis an agreement among competitors to fix the price of the products or \nservices they sell when the agreement is not reasonably necessary to \nthe operation of an efficiency-enhancing joint venture.\n  In fact, seeing my friend from Arizona on the floor, I would refer to \nthe Supreme Court decision Arizona v. Maricopa County Medical Society, \n457 U.S. 332 (1982). In that case, the Supreme Court held that a group \nof competing doctors who agreed on the maximum price at which they \nwould sell their services to insurers without substantially \nintegrating, that is, without becoming partners or joint venturers that \nshare financial risk, was engaged in per se illegal price fixing.\n  Madam President, I am advised the leadership would like to make an \nunanimous consent request, and I yield for that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n\n\n                      Unanimous-Consent Agreement\n\n  Mr. KYL. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator \nDomenici have 30 seconds to close, and the Senate then proceed to vote \non the motion to waive without further action or debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. LEAHY. Reserving the right to object, 30 seconds to close after I \nfinish or right now?\n  Mr. KYL. Right now.\n  I am sorry----\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I understand Senator Leahy was going to complete his \nspeech and then that would take place.\n  Mr. KYL. At the conclusion of his remarks.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Instead of giving the full amount, I will take about \nanother half minute, and then I have no objection. I enjoy hearing----\n  Mr. KYL. I amend the unanimous consent request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If the Senator from Arizona would finish his \nrequest?\n  Mr. KYL. The request is that at the conclusion of Senator Leahy's \nremarks, Senator Domenici have 30 seconds to close and we then proceed \nwithout any further debate to a vote on the motion to waive.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Madam President, I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, I understand Members may be trying to \nrestate the question by the Senator from Arizona. I will assure the \nSenator from Arizona and the Democratic leader that when they are \ngetting close to that I will yield immediately for them to make the \nrequest again.\n  Basically the point is a very serious point. I do not want to make \nmotions on this or other reconciliation bills. I do so only \nreluctantly. But this is such a major change in the antitrust law to be \ntucked in here absent hearings, absent debate, and absent votes. I \nthink is wrong.\n  For those Members of the Senate who are here, when we talked about \nthe Byrd rule in the first place, it was specifically for this. We are \ntalking about a reconciliation bill that goes past the normal debate \nrules of the Senate. I see the distinguished senior Senator from West \nVirginia on the floor. I think he would be the first to agree regarding \nthis reconciliation. \n\n[[Page S 17322]]\n\n  The budget reconciliation conference report would cast aside the per \nse rule, and override the Maricopa decision for provider groups and \nprovider-sponsored organizations or PSOs. Members of provider groups, \nsuch as doctors, would not be required to share financial risk in order \nto avoid per se treatment when they collectively set fees at which they \nprovide services. Instead, these loose-knit groups would merely have to \nmeet a checklist of criteria to qualify for the special treatment.\n  None of the group requirements is a substitute for the antitrust \nlaw's requirement of meaningful, shared risk. Under the language of the \nconference report the members need only be part of a group that ``is \nfunded in part by capital contributions made by the members.'' This is \nno substitute for the shared risk required of a joint venture under \nantitrust law.\n  Nor would members of PSOs be required to share financial risk under \ncurrently governing law in order to avoid per se treatment under \ntraditional analysis. Instead, they are provided their own special \nantitrust rule in subsection (e) by which ``affiliated'' providers need \nshare, ``directly or indirectly,'' barely a majority financial interest \nin the PSO. So long as the providers, who would otherwise be \ncompetitors, meet the indirect affiliation provisions of the bill, they \nwill be allowed to exchange information ``relating to costs, sales, \nprofitability, marketing, prices, or fees for any health care product \nor service.''\n  These provisions each require the antitrust enforcement agencies to \nconduct a resource-intensive analysis of the ``properly defined \nmarket'' in order to challenge conduct that normally would be swiftly \ncondemned as price fixing. Given limited enforcement resources, this \nchange in law inevitably would mean that some anticompetitive \nactivities will go unprosecuted. Could it be that this explains the \ndoctors' lobby's insistence on inclusion of this provision in the \nconference report?\n  The provisions regarding the provider groups admittedly have to \nrevenue or savings effect for deficit reduction purposes. The \nprovisions regarding the PSOs did not have a score until, miraculously, \njust before this debate was about to being.\n  Neither set of special rules is integral to Medicare reform. Although \ndefended as a means to encourage provider-sponsored health plans as an \nalternative to insurers, no such special antitrust treatment is needed \nto promote Medicare reform.\n  Provider networks already exist without any special antitrust rule. \nAccording to industry statistics, 20 percent of all PPOs and 15 percent \nof all HMOs are provider-owned. A survey by Modern Healthcare showed \nthat in 1994, without a special antitrust rule, over 9 million people \nwere enrolled in provider-owned PPOs. In addition, many other provider-\nsponsored managed care plans are being developed or planned without the \nenactment of a special antitrust rule. The Physician Payment Review \nCommission concluded in its 1995 Report to Congress that the available \ninformation did not indicate a significant problem of antitrust laws \nimpeding the development of provider-sponsored managed care plans. The \nPPRC Report noted press accounts indicating that many physician-\nsponsored networks are in the process or formation and that ``three-\nfourths of state medical societies are either contemplating or are \nactually in the process of establishing physician-sponsored networks.''\n  Finally, in the past 2 years the Federal Trade Commission and the \nDepartment of Justice have issued literally dozens of staff advisory \nopinions approving the proposed development of provider-sponsored \nnetworks.\n  The Senate bill contains no such provisions. In debate on our bill, \nSenator Frist expressly noted the absence of a Senate provision like \nproposed section 1853(f). Senator Hatch spoke to the ``creative \ntension'' in the health care delivery system involving providers and \ninsurers, and noted Senate consideration of the `` antitrust \nrequirements in current law.'' He concluded that the Senate bill, which \nhad no such special antitrust rule, met the goals of providing real \nhealth care choices while making sure that there is accountability. \nThus, no special antitrust rule was considered necessary when the \nSenate debated its Medicare reform package in its budget reconciliation \nbill a short time ago.\n  These provisions threaten significant injury to competition outside \nthe Medicare program. By allowing competing providers to share \ninformation about ``costs, sales, profitability, marketing, prices, or \nfees'' and to agree on prices in the context of MedicarePlus, the \nexemption is likely to have the effect of dampening competition among \nthose same providers for non-MedicarePlus business. For this reason \namong others, special antitrust rules of this type are opposed by the \nU.S. Chamber of Commerce, the National Business Coalition on Health, \nthe National Manufacturers Association, the ERISA Industry Committee, \nthe Business Roundtable, the APPWP--The Benefits Association, and the \nNational Association of Attorneys General.\n  No language--and certainly not the fig leaf provided in proposed \nsection 1853(f)(1)(B)(ii), which purports to limit the information \nexchanged among providers affiliated with a PSO to having not been used \nfor any other purpose than to establish the PSO--can effectively \nprevent against this spillover effect.\n  Once putative competitors are authorized by statute to share \ninformation about ``costs, sales, profitability, marketing, prices'' \nand fees and to agree on prices for MedicarePlus, they cannot and will \nnot be able to ignore that knowledge they already possess when it comes \nto setting their prices for others.\n  Providers who agree on prices to be demanded from PSOs or as PSOs may \nimplicitly agree to adhere to similar prices with respect to other \nactivities or moderate their competitive behavior based on the \nknowledge gained thereby. Once competing providers have met to \nnegotiate their fees, the information they have exchanged and the \nunderstandings they have reached would likely spill over into their \nother dealings and into non-MedicarePlus areas in which health care \nservices ought to be governed by competitive forces.\n  Thus, Gail R. Wilensky, Ph.D., the Chair of the Physician Payment \nReview Commission, recently testified on September 22, 1995, before the \nHouse Ways and Means Committee on Medicare Reform that ``even if a \nchange (in the antitrust laws) applies only to the Medicare market, it \nmay be difficult to keep potentially anticompetitive practices from \nspilling into other markets served by the networks.''\n  We do not need to enact such provisions and certainly should not do \nso as part of budget reconciliation. I object and trust my colleagues \nwill not approve such changes in our antitrust laws without proper \nanalysis, justification, study or debate.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Madam President, will the Senator from Vermont yield?\n  Mr. LEAHY. Certainly.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I apologize for the second time for interrupting the \ndistinguished Senator from Vermont. We want to accommodate a number of \nschedules, and the clock is ticking. I am trying to see if we can \naccommodate all Senators and arrive at a unanimous consent agreement \nthat will allow us to vote. The distinguished Senator from Florida had \nsome questions.\n  If we could have the unanimous consent request again propounded with \nthe understanding that, in addition to the 30 seconds for the Senator \nfrom New Mexico, the Senator from Florida could have 1 minute to ask \nsome questions, and I would ask unanimous consent that be included, and \npose the motion at this time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? If not, the Chair \nunderstands that there will be 30 seconds for the Senator from New \nMexico, and the Senator from Vermont would have 30 seconds.\n  Mr. LEAHY. No, the Senator from Vermont would complete his statement \nat which point I understand that the Senator from Florida would have a \nminute, the Senator from New Mexico would have 30 seconds, and then we \nwould have the vote that was discussed before.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KYL. Madam President, I further ask unanimous consent that, if \nthe motion to waive is not agreed to and the point of order is \nsustained, that the \n\n[[Page S 17323]]\nSenate proceed immediately to vote on the motion to concur with the \nSenate amendment to the House amendment with no further action or \ndebate, other than 5 minutes for each leader or manager, and that the \nvote be limited to 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Reserving the right to object, I thought I was going to \nget 5 minutes also.\n  Mr. KYL. For each leader and manager, I will amend the request. I am \nsorry. I misread that--each leader and manager.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, to accommodate those Senators who have \nschedules and other debates, I will wrap up with this.\n  The Byrd rule was put here by the distinguished senior Senator from \nWest Virginia because this reconciliation process changes the normal \nprocedures of the Senate. It changes the normal unlimited debate. It \nwas done to handle these fiscal matters, and not to allow a whole lot \nof things to come in without the debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. LEAHY. No. Madam President. That was not the unanimous consent \nrequest, I say to the Chair. The unanimous consent request was that at \nthe conclusion of my time we would have a minute for the Senator from \nFlorida, and 30 seconds for the Senator from New Mexico.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator from Vermont has \nexpired. He had 8 minutes, and the time has expired.\n  Mr. LEAHY. The Chair is correct in that.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the material of the Chamber of Commerce, \nthe National Business Coalition, Health, the National Association of \nAttorneys General and others, who objected to this provision be printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                         Federal Trade Commission,\n\n\n                                        Department of Justice,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, October 31, 1995.\n     Hon. Patrick J. Leahy,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Leahy: The Federal Trade Commission and the \n     Department of Justice (the ``Agencies'') are writing in \n     response to your letters of October 26, 1995, requesting the \n     Agencies' comments on two antitrust provisions in H.R. 2425, \n     the Medicare Preservation Act of 1995. The Administration \n     supports the increased availability of provider networks to \n     promote competition and expand competitive choices for \n     consumers. Further, the Administration believes that \n     legislative reforms, which include appropriate consumer \n     protection safeguards, are necessary to achieve this goal. \n     The Federal Trade Commission has taken no position on aspects \n     of Medicare reform other than the comments in this letter on \n     the two antitrust provisions of H.R. 2425.\n       However, the two antitrust provisions of H.R. 2425--one a \n     broad exemption for medical self-regulatory entities and the \n     other a relaxation of antitrust rules for provider service \n     networks--are unnecessary and could seriously undermine the \n     cost containment goals of Medicare reform efforts. Moreover, \n     these provisions would deprive all consumers--not only \n     Medicare beneficiaries--of the benefits of competition in \n     health care markets. The Agencies urge that Congress not \n     enact these provisions.\n\n\n        antitrust exemption for medical self-regulatory entities\n\n       Section 15221 of H.R. 2425, ``Exemptions from Antitrust \n     Laws for Certain Activities of Medical Self-Regulatory \n     Entities,'' would create a special antitrust exemption for \n     medical groups' setting or enforcing of ``standards'' that \n     are ``designed to promote quality of health care services.'' \n     If enacted, it would provide broad antitrust immunity for \n     anticompetitive activities that purport to improve the \n     quality of care, but in fact raise health care costs and \n     deprive consumers of choices in the marketplace, by \n     anticompetitively excluding other economic participants from \n     health care markets.\n       Antitrust enforcement actions have stopped physicians, \n     acting through medical societies and hospital medical staffs \n     under the guise of quality concerns, from engaging in \n     boycotts, price fixing, and other conduct harmful to \n     consumers. These enforcement actions have been instrumental \n     in enabling competitive alternatives to traditional fee-for-\n     service medicine to enter health care markets in the face of \n     provider opposition. For example, the Agencies enforcement \n     actions have challenged: medical societies' standards that \n     banned procompetitive alternatives to traditional fee-for-\n     service medicine--including physicians' employment by HMOs \n     and affiliation with non-physicians; hospital medical staff \n     boycotts, coercion of hospitals, and abuse of the \n     credentialling process, to block the development of \n     innovative forms of health care delivery, such as health \n     maintenance organizations; and medical societies' boycotts of \n     insurers to force them to pay higher fees to the societies' \n     members.\n       The unfortunate fact is that self-regulatory bodies \n     sometimes act to obstruct competition, and when they do so \n     their actions are often couched in quality-of-care terms. \n     This kind of conduct is not a thing of the past. Continued \n     antitrust enforcement against such anticompetitive activities \n     is essential if competitive forces are to play a role in \n     containing health care costs.\n       Encouraging industry self-regulation that is aimed at \n     improving quality is a laudable goal, but legitimate self-\n     regulatory activity is already permitted under current \n     antitrust law. The Federal Trade Commission and the \n     Department of Justice have not brought suits against such \n     legitimate conduct. In fact, they have repeatedly spread the \n     message that such conduct is lawful.\n       The Report of the House Committee on Ways and Means on H.R. \n     2425 indicates that the exemption for medical self-regulation \n     is intended to address concerns about private lawsuits \n     challenging peer review. The Report states that the Health \n     Care Quality Improvement Act of 1986, 42 U.S.C. Sec. 11101, \n     which eliminated private damage actions for good faith peer \n     review that is undertaken with certain procedural safeguards, \n     has been beneficial, but that antitrust suits have continued. \n     Even if some unjustified suits continue to be brought, \n     concerns about possible imperfections in that statute's \n     limitations on private damage actions would not justify H.R. \n     2425's broad exemption from all antitrust enforcement, \n     particularly including actions by the government.\n       The potential harm from the broadly worded exemption is not \n     significantly limited by Section 15221(b)(2)'s exclusion from \n     immunity where conduct is undertaken ``for purposes \n     of financial gain.'' As noted above, quality of care is \n     typically offered as a justification for anticompetitive \n     conduct by health care providers, sometimes based on the \n     sincere--but erroneous--belief that competition is \n     inappropriate in the health care industry. Moreover, \n     making the availability of immunity turn on defendants' \n     intent, rather than on the objective market consequences \n     of the challenged behavior, offers no real protection for \n     consumers. The absence of a motive for personal financial \n     gain does not lessen the injury to consumers that occurs \n     when competitors engage in conduct that is unreasonably \n     anticompetitive.\n       The Congressional Budget Office concluded that this \n     provision would increase federal spending, rather than \n     promote the cost containment goals of H.R. 2425. And the \n     impact would not be limited to the Medicare program. Granting \n     private medical organizations the power to adopt and enforce \n     standards without the check against abuses that antitrust law \n     provides is likely to stifle innovation, unnecessarily limit \n     consumer choice, and frustrate health care cost containment \n     efforts.\n\n\n       special antitrust treatment for provider service networks\n\n       Section 15021 of Subtitle A of H.R. 2425, ``Special \n     Antitrust Rule for Provider Service Networks,'' would exempt \n     certain groups of health care providers from the per se rule \n     against price-fixing that applies throughout the rest of the \n     economy. This provision is not necessary for the development \n     of the provider-sponsored entities that the Medicare reform \n     bills seek to encourage. It could, however, both undercut \n     H.R. 2425's reliance on competition to provide more cost-\n     effective services to Medicare beneficiaries, and impair non-\n     Medicare competition as well.\n       Like the Senate Medicare bill, H.R. 2425 would permit \n     certain provider organizations to contract directly with the \n     Medicare program to provide all covered services in return \n     for a monthly capitation payment. These organizations are \n     called ``provider service networks'' in the Senate bill and \n     ``provider-sponsored organizations'' (PSOs) in H.R. 2425. \n     ``Provider service networks'' (PSNs) under H.R. 2425 are \n     groups of providers that may contract with a PSO--in essence \n     as subcontractors--to provide services to Medicare \n     beneficiaries.\n       Section 15021(a) provides that the conduct of a PSN or its \n     members in fixing prices would be evaluated only under the \n     ``rule of reason'' antitrust analysis, rather than under the \n     ``per se'' rule usually applicable to price fixing by \n     competitors. Legitimate provider joint ventures already \n     receive ``rule of reason'' treatment, for example, where \n     their members share substantial financial risk. This is \n     because risk-sharing among members of such a group gives each \n     member the incentive to assure that the group as a whole \n     provides services in a cost-effective manner, achieving \n     efficiencies and cost-savings that competition is intended to \n     secure. Under Section 15021(a), however, members of a PSN who \n     do not share any financial risk, and thus do not have those \n     same incentives for cost-savings, would be able to set fees \n     collectively for services provided through a PSO without \n     regard to the usual ``per se'' rule against price fixing.\n       No special antitrust rule is necessary to allow providers \n     to form groups or networks, develop fee schedules for \n     participating providers, or set up providers panels, so long \n     as the providers share financial risk. In fact, \n\n[[Page S 17324]]\n     risk-sharing among providers in a group appears integral to the \n     purposes of the legislation: PSOs and other entities offering \n     Medicare products are required to assume full financial risk \n     for the provision of all covered services, in exchange for a \n     predetermined capitation payment. Under existing antitrust \n     law, such groups already receive rule of reason treatment, \n     and any other provider group that similarly shares financial \n     risks would receive the same antitrust treatment. H.R. 2425 \n     would allow PSNs that do not involve risk-sharing to qualify \n     for special antitrust treatment by meeting certain criteria. \n     However, none of these criteria is a substitute for the \n     incentives created by substantial financial risk-sharing.\n       The goal of promoting more cost-effective delivery of \n     Medicare services would not be furthered by allowing groups \n     of competing providers in a PSN to agree on the prices they \n     would demand from the PSO for treating patients under a \n     Medicare PSO contract, bargain collectively with the PSO, and \n     threaten a boycott if the PSO did not accept the providers' \n     terms. In such a case, even though the anticompetitive effect \n     of the conduct is clear and no countervailing efficiencies \n     are produced, the bill would require the antitrust agencies \n     to conduct a resource-intensive analysis of the market under \n     the rule of reason. Given the constraints on federal \n     antitrust enforcement resources, this can only mean that some \n     plainly anticompetitive activities will go unprosecuted.\n       The impact of the exemption could also extend beyond PSOs \n     to all managed care organizations operating in a particular \n     market. By allowing competing providers to agree on prices in \n     the context of bargaining to provide services to a Medicare \n     PSO, the exemption could have the unintended effect of \n     dampening competition among those same providers for non-PSO \n     business. Providers who agree on prices to be demanded of \n     PSOs may implicitly agree to adhere to similar demands when \n     dealing with other plans. Even absent bad intentions, once \n     competing providers have met to negotiate their fees for PSO \n     business, the information they have exchanged and the \n     understandings they have reached would likely spill over into \n     their dealings not only with other MedicarePlus \n     organizations, but also with the various organizations that \n     provide health care benefits to non-Medicare patients.\n       In sum, the antitrust provision in H.R. 2425 would harm \n     consumers and would run counter to the cost-reduction goals \n     of Medicare reform efforts.\n       The Department of Justice has be advised by the Office of \n     Management and Budget that there is no objection to the \n     submission of this letter from the standpoint of the \n     Administration's program.\n           Sincerely,\n     Anne K. Bingaman,\n       Assistant Attorney General.\n       By direction of the Commission.\n     Robert Pitofsky,\n       Chairman.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                               September 26, 1995.\n     Hon. William V. Roth, Jr.,\n     Chairman, Committee on Finance\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: We are a coalition of physician group \n     practices, non-physician providers, employers, managed care \n     networks and insurers who are opposed to including special \n     antitrust preferences for physicians as part of Medicare \n     reform legislation.\n       Physicians are not alone in feeling the pressure of \n     increased competition. All of us doing business in the health \n     care market are facing increased competition. Yet, we do not \n     believe that competitive pressures warrant special antitrust \n     preferences for physicians or any other provider. Such \n     preferences are unnecessary and harmful to competition and \n     consumer choice in the marketplace. If the goal is to apply \n     the successes of the private health care market to reforming \n     the Medicare program, then weakening the antitrust laws for \n     physicians is truly misguided. Senior citizens and all \n     consumers should have health plan choices--but choices that \n     are indeed competitive.\n       The attached Washington Post article underscores the need \n     to maintain strong antitrust enforcement in order to ensure \n     that consumers, not competitors, determine the range and \n     prices of goods and services offered in the health care \n     marketplace.\n       Unfortunately, the American Medical Association (AMA) is \n     seeking special treatment under the antitrust laws. Under the \n     AMA's proposal, physicians would be allowed to agree on the \n     prices they will charge and collectively negotiate with \n     lawyers while essentially remaining individual competitors. \n     In other words, little substantial risk-sharing on the part \n     of physicians would be required, effectively reducing \n     incentives to compete on cost, quality and efficiency. In \n     addition, physician networks would be subject to more lenient \n     enforcement of the law than all other providers.\n       Advocates of changes to the law contend that current \n     antitrust laws and enforcement must be relaxed to allow \n     physicians to compete on a ``level playing field'' with other \n     network organizers such as hospitals. HMOs and insurers. \n     While this argument may appear reasonable at a glance, a \n     closer examination of the issue reveals quite the opposite. \n     The antitrust changes that the AMA seeks to include as part \n     of Medicare reform are little more than well-disguised \n     attempts to side-step the strong free market protections \n     afforded by current law.\n       The following briefing paper tells the real story.\n           Sincerely,\n         American Group Practice Association, American Association \n           of Nurse Anesthetists, Academy of Nurse Practitioners, \n           American Nurses Association, AETNA, American Managed \n           Care and Review Association, American College of Nurse \n           Mid-wives, Association of Private Pension and Welfare \n           Plans, American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, \n           Blue Cross & Blue Shield Association, CIGNA, FHP Health \n           Care, Group Health Association of America, Health Care \n           Compare, Corp., Health Insurance Association of \n           America, Kaiser Permanente, Kansas City Blue Cross & \n           Blue Shield, Metrahealth, National Association of \n           Manufacturers, National Capital PPO, Nat's Assoc. of \n           Nurse Practitioners in Reproductive Health, Opticians \n           Association of America, Sierra Health Services, The \n           Erisa Industry Committee, The Principal Financial \n           Group, The Prudential, U.S. Healthcare, Inc., Wausau \n           Insurance Companies.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n               [From the Washington Post, Sept. 14, 1995]\n\n              Doctors, Hospitals Sued on Monopoly Charges\n\n       The Justice Department yesterday charged doctors and \n     hospitals in two states with using monopoly power to block \n     lower-priced managed health care systems from competing--in \n     one case for almost a decade.\n       It was the first time the agency's anti-trust division \n     filed price-fixing lawsuits accusing hospitals of scheming \n     with doctors to ensure their own higher profits while health \n     care costs rise.\n       Both groups--in Danbury, Conn., and St. Joseph, Mo--denied \n     the charges. But both also agreed to consent decrees in which \n     they promised to change the way they do business.\n       The complaint said that beginning in May 1994 and \n     continuing through August, Danbury Hospital, the only \n     acutecare facility in the area, forced patients to use its \n     outpatient facilities, joined with ``virtually all of the \n     doctors on its medical staff' to raise fees, and purposely \n     limited the size and mix of its medical staff to reduce \n     competition among local doctors.\n       In Missouri, the Justice Department said, the price-fixing \n     conspiracy occurred from April 1986 through June 1995. The \n     complaint said about 85 percent of the doctors in Buchanan \n     County formed a group in 1986 ``to prevent or delay the \n     development of managed care in the area.''\n       In 1990, the group then joined with the only local \n     hospital, Heartland, to form Health Choice to further lock up \n     the medical services and profits in the area, the lawsuit \n     said.\n\nSpecial Antitrust Preferences for Physicians Limit Competition, Choice \n                and Innovation in the Health Care Market\n\n       Current antitrust law does allow for the formation of \n     physician-sponsored networks.\n       Physicians can join together and agree on price and other \n     terms of business so long as they ``integrate'' by sharing \n     financial risk. Risk-sharing can be achieved in a variety of \n     ways and is critical to ensure that physicians do not come \n     together to simply fix prices while remaining separate \n     competitors. Numerous physician networks have successfully \n     ``integrated'' and are now competing in virtually every \n     market in the country. Some of the most notable examples are \n     the Mayo Clinic in Minnesota and the Cleveland Clinic in \n     Ohio. These multi-specialty physician group practices were \n     formed under existing antitrust laws, without special \n     preferences.\n       Alternatively physicians can also join together to form \n     Preferred Provider Organizations (PPOs) and negotiate fees \n     with HMOs and other third-party payers without integrating \n     their practices. These more loosely organized groups can \n     perform many of the same functions as their fully integrated \n     counterparts, including quality assurance, utilization \n     review, and administrative services. Guidelines issued by the \n     Department of Justice (DOJ) and the Federal Trade Commission \n     (FTC) make this clear.\n       Loosening integration requirements is harmful to consumers \n     because it reduces the incentive for providers to compete. \n     Current integration requirements are not barriers to the \n     formation physician-sponsored plans. They are barriers to \n     price-fixing, boycotts and other forms of anti-market \n     activities. Ultimately, substantial financial integration is \n     what drives competition on quality, efficiency and cost.\n       Physicians are not disadvantaged with respect to other \n     providers under the antitrust laws.\n       The purpose of strong antitrust enforcement policies is to \n     protect consumers, not competitors. The notion that \n     physicians need special antitrust preferences because the \n     antitrust laws are biased against physicians is inaccurate \n     and misleading. Joint ventures arranged by like competitors \n     in every other industry are subject to essentially the same \n     level of scrutiny as physician-sponsored networks.\n       Similarly, insurers and other providers are not exempt from \n     antitrust enforcement. If insurers either agreed among \n     themselves on payment levels or tried to wield market power \n     by driving prices down, they too would run afoul of the \n     antitrust laws.\n       In its 1995 Report to Congress, the Physician Payment \n     Review Commission (PPRC) \n\n[[Page S 17325]]\n     concluded that ``the available evidence of problems is not sufficient \n     to warrant creating safe harbors or other exemptions from the \n     antitrust laws for physician-sponsored networks at this time. \n     Amending the antitrust laws is a serious step that should be \n     undertaken only in the face of compelling evidence that \n     change is required. The limited available factual evidence, \n     however, does not currently suggest the widespread existence \n     of problems.''\n       Consequently, what the AMA is really asking for is the \n     ability to compete outside the free market principles that \n     every other competitor must abide by.\n       Special antitrust treatment for physicians, such as loose \n     integration requirements and substitution of the rule of \n     reason for the per se rule would diminish consumer power in \n     the marketplace.\n       A number of changes to the antitrust laws have been \n     advocated by the AMA, ranging from outright exemptions to \n     relaxing risk-sharing requirements and elimination of the per \n     se rule. The per se rule has allowed the courts and \n     enforcement agencies to efficiently call a halt to activities \n     that are blatantly harmful to consumers. It reflects a \n     determination that some conduct--such as price-fixing and \n     group boycotts--is so likely to harm consumers that it should \n     be found unlawful in all circumstances. It is a rule that \n     applies to all providers and all industries.\n       The rule of reason, in contrast, requires a balancing of \n     the competitive harm arising from particular conduct against \n     the possible economic benefits it produces. However, it is \n     also more difficult under this rule to challenge \n     anticompetitive conduct because many more creative defenses \n     and justifications can be raised. If antitrust enforcement \n     agencies could only prosecute antitrust violations by \n     provider physician-sponsored networks under the rule of \n     reason, they would be forced to utilize greater resources and \n     face a reduced likelihood of success. If rule of reason \n     treatment was extended to provider-sponsored networks, but \n     not to other types of health care networks, provider \n     organizations would enjoy distinct advantages that would not \n     be shared by other health plans. This would put those plans \n     at a competitive disadvantage.\n       History is replete with examples of physician group \n     boycotts and efforts to keep other physician group practices \n     and non-physicians, such as nurse mid-wives and nurse \n     anesthetists, from offering consumers choice. One of the best \n     examples of this is the experience of the physician-owned \n     Cleveland Clinic. In 1991, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) \n     put a halt to physician boycotts aimed at preventing \n     Cleveland Clinic doctors from establishing a practice in \n     Florida. This case was brought under the per se rule--the \n     very rule from which AMA seeks an exemption. Similarly, prior \n     to 1979, the AMA bound its members to rules that prevented \n     physicians from contracting with HMOs. These rules \n     effectively prevented price competition among doctors and \n     hindered the development of new, innovative health care \n     delivery systems, such as HMOs and PPOs. The Supreme Court \n     agreed and forced the AMA to drop its anticompetitive rules.\n       The DOJ and FTC have provided substantial guidance to \n     health care providers to address their concerns.\n       In response to concerns raised by providers, the Department \n     of Justice (DOJ) and the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) \n     jointly issued the Statements of Antitrust Enforcement Policy \n     in the Health Care Area. These statements, or guidelines, \n     provide a detailed road map of the analysis that the federal \n     enforcement agencies will apply to the most significant \n     issues facing the health care industry. The guidelines \n     include ``safety zones'' clarifying what types of mergers, \n     joint ventures, and other activities would be considered \n     lawful. The DOJ/FTC have made a special effort to address \n     physician networks and rural health care markets.\n       For physicians and other providers who have questions about \n     forming integrated networks, the agencies offer opportunities \n     for more specific advice through their business review and \n     advisory opinion letter process. The agencies' business \n     review and advisory opinion procedures allow parties to \n     obtain a statement of the agencies' enforcement intentions \n     before the transaction is implemented. The agencies have \n     committed to providing expedited 90-day reviews. The agencies \n     have also committed to continued monitoring of evolving \n     health care markets so they can respond to changes on an on-\n     going basis. To date, virtually every physician-sponsored \n     network has been approved.\n       The health care industry has responded enthusiastically to \n     these initiatives. According to a January 1995 Bureau of \n     National Affairs (BNA) survey of counselors advising \n     providers, the ``almost blanket clearances by the Justice \n     Department and FTC of proposals to create managed care \n     networks is assuaging health care industry concerns about the \n     impact of antitrust law . . .''\n                                                                    ____\n\n         Business for Medicare Reform: APPWP--The Benefits \n           Association; The Business Roundtable; The ERISA \n           Industry Committee; National Association of \n           Manufacturers; National Business Coalition on Health; \n           U.S. Chamber of Commerce,\n                                                 October 17, 1995.\n     Hon. Newt Gingrich,\n     Hon. William Archer,\n     Hon. Michael Bilirakis,\n     Hon. Thomas Bliley,\n     Hon. Dennis Hastert,\n     Hon. Gerald Solomon,\n     Hon. William Thomas.\n       Dear Representatives: We are writing as representatives of \n     small and large businesses who have been supportive of your \n     efforts to save Medicare by passing the Medicare Preservation \n     Act. We have been gratified by the commitment you have made \n     to fundamentally restructuring Medicare by drawing on the \n     successful health care reform strategies pioneered by private \n     employers. Moreover, employers have been willing to accept \n     considerable costs in order to save Medicare.\n       Just a very few years ago, most health care policymakers \n     and analysts believed that the private sector could not \n     contain health care costs. Employers have proved this wrong, \n     by using their purchasing power to create more competitive \n     markets and demanding better care at lower cost. Based on our \n     knowledge of what it took to get this job done, we have \n     important reservations about a limited number of the Medicare \n     Preservation Act's provisions. We are concerned that these \n     provisions would undermine the very strategies that (a) \n     employers have used to control costs and improve quality and \n     (b) the Act uses as the foundation for a new and sustainable \n     Medicare program. We urge you to reconsider these provisions.\n       Our most important concerns are as follows:\n       Antitrust Changes for Health Care Providers. We are \n     extremely concerned by the antitrust law changes included in \n     Sections 15021 and 15221 of the Act, which would affect \n     employer-sponsored health plans as well as MedicarePlus \n     plans. We ask that they be stricken.\n       Unfortunately, organized medicine has a long history of \n     attempting to suppress alternative health care delivery \n     systems. Antitrust enforcement has been an important tool in \n     overcoming this opposition to innovative ways of delivering \n     higher quality care at lower cost. Section 15221's changes to \n     antitrust law would allow organized medicine to engage in a \n     much higher level of anticompetitive activity, thereby \n     increasing costs and reducing the quality of care. In \n     contrast, employers have created the new, competitive health \n     care market and better ways to measure and improve quality \n     under current antitrust law, which also leaves broad \n     leeway for health care providers to collaborate in \n     legitimate self-regulatory activity.\n       Employers have been able to control costs and improve \n     quality by using their purchasing power to create competitive \n     health care markets. The antitrust law changes in Section \n     15021 would shift the balance between health care providers \n     and purchasers in favor of providers, undermining employers' \n     ability to be effective purchasers and jeopardizing their \n     hard won victories over health care cost inflation and poor \n     quality care. Putting purchasers at a disadvantage by \n     changing antitrust law risks a return to health care \n     hyperinflation and unaccountability for quality.\n       Medical Liability Reforms. Employers have long supported \n     medical liability reform, including changes to the collateral \n     source rule. However, the version of collateral source rule \n     reform in the Act eliminates employers' right of subrogation. \n     This shifts the cost of treating injuries caused by a \n     negligent provider from the provider who caused the injury to \n     employers. We urge that you revise the Act to provide for a \n     different version of collateral source rule reform that \n     appropriately prevents double recovery by plaintiffs without \n     inappropriately shifting responsibility for injuries caused \n     by negligent providers to employers.\n       Medicare Secondary Payer Expansions. The Act expands \n     employers' Medicare secondary payer liability. This does \n     nothing to improve health care efficiency or quality. Rather, \n     it simply shifts costs to private sector payers. Small \n     employers in particular are vulnerable to this kind of cost-\n     shifting. We urge that the expansions of Medicare secondary \n     payer liability be eliminated.\n       As you know, managed care plans able to efficiently deliver \n     high quality care have played a key role in employers' \n     market-based health reform strategy. No aspect of the \n     Medicare Preservation Act is more important to employers than \n     its treatment of managed care plans. We are gratified that \n     the Act as introduced by Chairman Archer and Chairman Bliley \n     did not include antimanaged care rules. Including antimanaged \n     care rules in the Act would increase costs and reduce \n     quality. Moreover, including antimanaged care rules would \n     directly and adversely affect employer-sponsored health plans \n     as well as MedicarePlus plans, since the same networks will \n     serve Medicare beneficiaries and employer-sponsored plans.\n       It is our understanding that most of the antimanaged care \n     rules adopted in committee as amendments to the Act have been \n     stricken. (These amendments included restrictions on (1) the \n     criteria health plans may use when selecting providers, (2) \n     efforts to eliminate medically inappropriate emergency room \n     treatment and (3) denial of care that is not medically \n     necessary.) We applaud this result. We urge you to strike the \n     remaining antimanaged care amendment (restricting permissible \n     contractual relationships between health plans and providers) \n     and to continue adhering to the policy of avoiding \n     antimanaged care rules as the Medicare Preservation Act moves \n     through the legislative process.\n\n[[Page S 17326]]\n\n       It also is our understanding that a technical error in the \n     medical liability reforms that would have inadvertently \n     expanded employers' liability by interfering with current \n     grievance procedures provided for under the Employee \n     Retirement Income Security Act has been resolved. We \n     appreciate your efforts to resolve this matter, which is \n     vitally important to employers who voluntarily sponsor health \n     benefits for their employees.\n       Again, we strongly support your efforts to save Medicare. \n     It is essential that they succeed. However, as \n     representatives of the businesses that originated the \n     strategies that the Medicare Preservation Act is built on, we \n     urge adoption of a few technical changes that would greatly \n     strengthen the Act's ability to achieve its goals. These \n     changes also would eliminate our concerns about the Act's \n     effects on businesses that voluntarily offer health benefits \n     to their employees.\n       We would be pleased to further discuss these issues with \n     you at your convenience.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                         U.S. Chamber of Commerce,\n\n\n                                 Business for Medicare Reform,\n\n                                                 October 23, 1995.\n     Hon. William V. Roth, Jr.,\n     Chairman, Finance Committee,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Roth. We are writing as representatives of \n     small and large businesses that are working hard to control \n     health care costs and improve quality. We have been gratified \n     by the Finance Committee's decision to fundamentally improve \n     Medicare by drawing on the successful health reform \n     strategies pioneered by private employers.\n       Just a few years ago, most health care policymakers \n     believed that the private sector could not contain health \n     care costs. Employers have proved this wrong, by using their \n     purchasing power to create more competitive markets, \n     demanding better care at lower costs, measuring outcomes and \n     consumer satisfaction, and developing networks through \n     selective contracting with the best providers. Based on our \n     knowledge of what it took to get this job done, we are \n     concerned that potential floor amendments to the Finance \n     Committee bill would undermine the very strategies that (a) \n     employers have used to control costs and improve quality and \n     (b) the bill uses as the foundation for a new and sustainable \n     Medicare program. These potential amendments include \n     antitrust exemptions for health care providers and mandated \n     point-of-service coverage by network-based plans. We strongly \n     oppose these potential amendments to the Finance Committee \n     bill.\n       The damage that would be caused by adding these amendments \n     to Medicare reform legislation would not be limited to higher \n     Medicare costs and lower quality. Because Medicare is such a \n     large factors in health care markets and because Medicare and \n     employer-sponsored health plans will use the same provider \n     networks, antitrust exceptions for providers and antimanaged \n     care rules would directly harm employer-sponsored plans. \n     Working Americans and their families would face higher costs, \n     reduced coverage and lower quality.\n\n\n                   opposition to antitrust exemptions\n\n       One potential amendment would grant an antitrust exemption \n     to medical self-regulatory organizations. Unfortunately, \n     organized medicine has a long history of attempting to \n     suppress coordinated health care delivery systems. Antitrust \n     enforcement has been an important tool in overcoming this \n     opposition to innovative ways of delivering higher quality \n     care at lower cost. An antitrust exemption for medical self-\n     regulatory organizations would allow organized medicine to \n     engage in a much higher level of anticompetitive activity, \n     thereby increasing costs and reducing the quality of care. \n     Notably, current antitrust law leaves broad leeway for health \n     care providers to collaborate in legitimate self-regulatory \n     activity.\n       Employer-led efforts to improve accountability and quality \n     in the health care system by making data available to health \n     care consumers has been a leading cause of the positive \n     changes in the health care market. This data has become \n     available--often in the face of provider resistance--only \n     because private employees took the initiative to develop it \n     and demand that providers supply it. Granting providers an \n     antitrust exemption, thereby permitting them to monopolize \n     the quality standard-setting process, will seriously erode \n     accountability for quality and value.\n       Another potential antitrust amendment would grant an \n     exemption to provider-sponsored organizations. Employers have \n     been able to control costs and improve quality by using their \n     purchasing power to create competitive health care markets. \n     An antitrust exemption for provider-sponsored organizations \n     would shift the balance between health care providers and \n     purchasers in favor of providers, undermining employers' \n     ability to be effective purchasers. Putting purchasers at a \n     disadvantage by changing antitrust law risks a return to \n     health care hyperinflation and unaccountability for quality.\n\n\n                 opposition to point-of-service mandate\n\n       A recent Lewin-VHI study found that a point-of-service \n     mandate would add even more to the nation's health care bill \n     than an ``any willing provider'' mandate. Experience confirms \n     a point-of-service mandate's high cost. A study of Florida \n     employers' 1993 health crisis found that point-of-service \n     plans cost over 20 percent more than HMOs. Prohibiting \n     closed-panel plans from participating in Medicare would force \n     even those Medicare beneficiaries who want to enroll in a \n     closed-panel plan--such as the 3 million seniors who already \n     have chosen such plans over the traditional Medicare system--\n     to pay higher premiums.\n       A point-of-service mandate undermines the entire purpose of \n     Medicare reform. Because the traditional Medicare program is \n     unsustainable, the Finance Committee bill encourages \n     beneficiaries to shift to private health plans. A point-of-\n     service mandate would drive up private plans' costs, \n     encouraging continued enrollment in the government-run \n     system. As a result, Medicare reform would fail to produce a \n     modernized, more efficient Medicare.\n       Both point-of-service plans and closed panel plans have \n     earned an important place in the market--based on consumers' \n     choices, not government mandates. In fact, employers have \n     found that employee enrollment in closed panel HMOs increased \n     at the same time that point-of-service plan availability and \n     enrollment increased. Market forces rather than government \n     microregulation should determine point-of-service plans' role \n     in Medicare. Certainly, the federal government should not \n     deny consumers the freedom to choose and the savings of \n     private health plans that only contract with selected \n     providers. Moreover, the Finance Committee bill requires all \n     plans that only contract with selected providers, like every \n     other private plan (but not the traditional government-run \n     Medicare program), to meet quality standards.\n       The Finance Committee made the right choice by keeping \n     antitrust exemptions for organized medicine and a point-of-\n     service mandate out of its Medicare reform bill. We urge you \n     to oppose any floor amendments that would add these \n     provisions, or any other antimanaged care rules, to the \n     Finance Committee's Medicare bill.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                           National Association of\n\n\n                                            Attorneys General,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, October 26, 1995.\n     Hon. Newt Gingrich,\n     Speaker of the House, House of Representatives,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Speaker Gingrich: As Chair and Vice-Chair of the \n     Antitrust Committee and Chair and Vice-Chair of the Health \n     Care Task Force of the National Association of Attorneys \n     General (NAAG), we are writing to express our concern about \n     two antitrust provisions included in H.R. 2425, the Medicare \n     Preservation Act of 1995. These provisions, sections 15021 \n     and 15221 of the Act, are unnecessary and could frustrate the \n     cost-containment goals of the Medicare legislation. We urge \n     that these provisions not be included in the final Medicare \n     reform package.\n       The Attorneys General, as chief law officers of their \n     states, are the primary enforcers of the states' antitrust \n     law, and also represent their states and the citizens of \n     their states in federal antitrust litigation. As chief legal \n     officers, the Attorneys General have had and continue to have \n     an important role in the development of national competition \n     policy. We know first-hand that the antitrust laws benefit \n     consumers by protecting competition and promoting efficiency, \n     innovation, low prices, better management and greater \n     consumer choice. Although the Attorneys General as a group \n     have not had an opportunity to consider this legislation, \n     past NAAG policy positions have consistently opposed both new \n     antitrust exemptions and the weakening of antitrust \n     enforcement standards for specific industries.\n       Section 15221 of the Act provides an exemption from both \n     state and federal antitrust laws for activity relating to \n     medical self-regulation. We believe that inclusion of this \n     provision is inadvisable. Unfortunately, state Attorneys \n     General have had experience with physicians and other health \n     care providers who have engaged in anticompetitive \n     activities, including physicians' attempts to eliminate \n     competition from HMOs, PPOs and allied health care \n     professionals. For this reason, in a 1993 Resolution, the \n     Attorneys General stated their belief that exempting health \n     care providers from the antitrust laws is undesirable. Nor is \n     the exemption contained in section 15221 necessary. Current \n     antitrust law permits collaborative activities, including \n     standard-setting activities, that benefit the public and do \n     not injure competition.\n       Section 15021 of the Act provides that certain actions of a \n     provider service network or an individual member of that \n     network shall not be deemed illegal per se under either \n     federal or state antitrust law, but shall instead be judged \n     under the ``rule of reason.'' We are concerned that this \n     relaxation of antitrust standards could lead to higher \n     prices and fewer choices for consumers. Under current law, \n     per se treatment is reserved for the most anticompetitive \n     conduct, including horizontal price-fixing. As stated in a \n     1986 NAAG Resolution, the Attorneys General oppose new \n     industry-specific antitrust standards because present \n     antitrust standards adequately protect the interests of \n     businesses, as well as consumers, by preventing activities \n     that have no pro-competitive justification. More \n     specifically, in the health care area, the Attorneys \n     General believe that competition promotes more affordable \n     health care, development of innovative new delivery \n     systems, and increased information for health care \n     consumers.\n       Finally, we are concerned about the broad preemption of \n     state antitrust enforcement, particularly in section 15221, \n     which is not limited to protection of activities within the \n     Medicare program. In a 1994 Resolution, the \n\n[[Page S 17327]]\n     Attorneys General opposed preemption of state antitrust enforcement in \n     the health care area because such preemption crodes state \n     sovereignty and threatens the system of federalism \n     established by the Constitution. Health care is predominately \n     a local industry that varies significantly from state to \n     state. The Attorneys General, as chief law enforcement \n     officers, should continue to be able to prevent \n     anticompetitive behavior within each state.\n       If you have any questions about our views, please feel free \n     to contact us or Emily Myers, NAAG Counsel for Antitrust and \n     Health at (202) 434-8015.\n           Very truly yours,\n     J.

It is our understanding that the \n     reconciliation bill before the Senate includes a number of \n     anti-consumer provisions which may violate the Byrd rule. \n     Those provisions include antitrust exemptions for provider \n     service networks, elimination of laboratory testing standards \n     for most tests performed in physician offices, preemption of \n     state authority to implement consumer protection standards \n     for managed care plans and physician self-referral.\n       On behalf of the following organizations, we strongly ask \n     that you support every effort to remove these harmful \n     provisions from the reconciliation bill. Inclusion of the \n     items listed above will drive up costs, threaten patient \n     safety and reduce the quality of health care for all \n     Americans.\n           Sincerely,\n         AIDS Action Council, American Public Health Association, \n           Church Women United, Citizen Action, Consumer \n           Federation of America, Consumers Union, National \n           Association of Social Workers, National Farmers Union, \n           National Council of Senior Citizens, Neighbor To \n           Neighbor, Public Citizen's Congress Watch, Service \n           Employees International Union.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida is recognized for a \nminute.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Madam President, I would like to ask if the Senator from \nArizona would please respond to a question. I hope they could be \nanswered ``yes'' or ``no''.\n  Mr. KYL. If I can.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Does this provision relate exclusively to the Federal, or \ndoes it apply to State antitrust law?\n  Mr. KYL. My understanding is that it applies to both Federal and \nState.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Please refer to the bottom line, page 17, No. 2. Does \nthis provision relate exclusively to Medicaid, or does it apply to \nother forms of health care?\n  Mr. KYL. It refers only to the Medicare contracts, and the \norganizations pursuant to obtaining the Medicare contract.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. I would ask the Senator to refer to 318, paragraph B.\n  Thank you, Madam President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, the Byrd rule was put into effect--not \nthat it would rule all the time but that it would be waived.\n  I submit that anybody in this body that wants the Medicare law to \nwork in rural areas, if you talked to anybody in rural areas, they will \ntell you one of the most important things pending before us, to see \nthat we get delivery in rural areas, is this provision which is being \ndropped, if we make it subject to the Byrd rule. Because, without it in \nrural areas there will be no ability for doctors and hospitals in the \nrural areas to get together and have new units to deliver health care. \nThere will be no competition and no service except for monster HMOs in \nthe rural areas.\n  We really ought to waive the Byrd rule in this instance.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has expired. The question is on \nagreeing to the motion to waive the Congressional Budget Act with \nrespect to the antitrust provision. On this question, the yeas and nays \nhave been ordered, and the clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Are there any other Senators in the Chamber \nwho desire to vote?\n  The yeas and nays resulted--yeas 54, nays 45, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 583 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--54\n\n     Abraham\n     Ashcroft\n     Baucus\n     Bennett\n     Bond\n     Breaux\n     Brown\n     Burns\n     Campbell\n     Coats\n     Cochran\n     Cohen\n     Coverdell\n     Craig\n     D'Amato\n     DeWine\n     Dole\n     Domenici\n     Faircloth\n     Frist\n     Gorton\n     Gramm\n     Grams\n     Grassley\n     Gregg\n     Hatch\n     Hatfield\n     Helms\n     Hutchison\n     Inhofe\n     Jeffords\n     Kassebaum\n     Kempthorne\n     Kyl\n     Lott\n     Lugar\n     Mack\n     McCain\n     McConnell\n     Murkowski\n     Nickles\n     Nunn\n     Pressler\n     Roth\n     Santorum\n     Shelby\n     Simpson\n     Smith\n     Snowe\n     Stevens\n     Thomas\n     Thompson\n     Thurmond\n     Warner\n\n                                NAYS--45\n\n     Akaka\n     Biden\n     Bingaman\n     Boxer\n     Bradley\n     Bryan\n     Bumpers\n     Byrd\n     Chafee\n     Conrad\n     Daschle\n     Dodd\n     Dorgan\n     Exon\n     Feingold\n     Feinstein\n     Ford\n     Glenn\n     Graham\n     Harkin\n     Heflin\n     Hollings\n     Inouye\n     Johnston\n     Kennedy\n     Kerrey\n     Kerry\n     Kohl\n     Lautenberg\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Lieberman\n     Mikulski\n     Moseley-Braun\n     Moynihan\n     Murray\n     Pell\n     Pryor\n     Reid\n     Robb\n     Rockefeller\n     Sarbanes\n     Simon\n     Specter\n     Wellstone\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. On this vote, the yeas are 54, the nays are \n45. Three-fifths of the Senators duly chosen and sworn not having voted \nin the affirmative, the motion is not agreed to.\n  The Chair is prepared to rule on the points of order made by the \nSenator from Nebraska.\n  The Chair sustains both points of order.\n  The question before the Senate is whether the Senate shall recede \nfrom its amendment to H.R. 2491 and concur therein with a further \namendment. Pursuant to the Budget Act, that amendment is the text of \nthe conference report (House Report 104-350) excluding the provisions \nstricken on the points of order.\n  According to the previous order, each leader and each manager have 5 \nminutes for debate.\n  Who seeks recognition? Who seeks recognition under the previous \norder? Under the previous order, each leader and each manager has 5 \nminutes.\n  The Senator from Nebraska is recognized for 5 minutes.\n  (Mr. GORTON assumed the chair.)\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, in a few minutes, the Senate will \nunfortunately adopt this conference report to the reconciliation bill.\n  Although I will not vote for the legislation, I certainly want to \ncongratulate Chairman Domenici for his leadership and for the many \nmonths of yeoman labor that he put in on this piece of legislation. He \nmade the hard choices, some good and, in my opinion, many bad, but he \nwas a true leader of great merit, and I congratulate him.\n  Mr. President, my colleagues on the other side of the aisle will \nsavor their victory, but I must also say to all Senators that it is \ntime to move on. With victory short lived and the fate of this bill \ncertain, it will soon take its place in veto history.\n  Mr. President, where do we go from here? In my 17 years in the \nSenate, I have never seen such a poisonous atmosphere as the one that \nhangs thick over the Nation's Capitol. The nervous truce that existed \nin January has collapsed. We are, in the words of President Lincoln, \n``a house divided against itself.'' I still nurture the hope that we \nwill find a way out of this morass and that our leaders--especially \nthose in the other body--will set aside pettiness, vanity, and rigid \nideology for the good of the Nation. There is no honor in the dishonor \nthat has been brought about by the actions of the last few days and the \nlast few hours.\n  I firmly believe, with every fiber in my body, that we should balance \nthe budget. So do the American people. It is the stark route that the \nRepublican majority took, however, that cleaves our ranks.\n  I tell my Republican friends that if we ever can come to an agreement \non a balanced budget, we cannot adhere to the current formulas that \nexist in the conference report. It hobbles any hope that we can redeem \nour differences in a constructive alliance to balance the budget. But \nwe must keep trying.\n  I yield my remaining time. \n\n[[Page S 17328]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from New \nMexico is recognized.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, fellow Senators, I have a lot of people \nto thank for this evening. While the Senators on that side do not think \nit is a very joyous or auspicious occasion, Senators on this side do, \nand I do. I have waited a long time, as a U.S. Senator, to see this \nevening arrive. It is truly a historic opportunity for politicians \nbecause, as I see it, this was the one chance we have to vote for the \nfuture. We have an opportunity every day to vote for something for \ntoday, a program for today, something to give to people today. But, \nessentially, what we are voting on this evening is a vote for the \nfuture of this country and for children not yet born and for those who \nare not yet receiving anything from the Federal Government, but who \nwant an opportunity and have a dream.\n  We are saying the one thing that makes that more and more difficult \nis 25 years of fiscal policy that has the United States borrowing as if \nno one else needed any money, as if those that work, those that need \ninvestment did not need money, just the Federal Government needed it. \nAnd it was like we were a money tree, America was a money tree, and the \nmoney all went to Washington. And when we did not have enough, we \nborrowed it from foreigners--from Japan, from our banks, from our \npeople. The question is: Who will pay the piper?\n  We have decided here tonight that the piper will not be our children \nand grandchildren, but rather in due course, the adults who live today \nwill pay for what we give to our people today and provide a future for \nour children and grandchildren.\n  Now, I understand that the President is going to veto this bill, and \nI have a word for the President. Since he has told us in advance, I \nwould like to tell him in advance. As he sits down with his veto pen, I \nhope he feels heavy, because on his shoulders is our future and our \nchildren's future. As he signs with that left hand of his, he better \nhave something pretty good in mind for our children in the future, \nbecause he is throwing away a real legacy of opportunity, and he better \nbe prepared to tell us and tell the American people and tell our senior \ncitizens what he has in mind, because I have not seen anything yet that \nhe has in mind that comes anywhere close to what we are giving to our \nchildren and grandchildren here tonight when we vote ``aye'' on this \nmeasure.\n  For those who have voted these many times--58 votes on the budget \nresolution, and I do not know how many different times--I say to each \none of them, your vote was not in vain. And if those on the other side \nand in the White House think they will use this against us, just think \nwhat we are going to use against them if this President vetoes this and \nwe end up with nothing.\n  For those who are against that, there is a real chance that we will \nget nothing, except $200 billion in deficits for as far as the eye can \nsee. I also say to those who voted for it, and will vote for it again \ntonight, you have changed the course of fiscal policy and the way we \nspend our people's money forever, because no longer will a Budget \nCommittee in the future have its hearings and hear ``there is no way we \ncan cut spending, and we cannot do this and we cannot cut that.''\n  Well, we have shown that, in a very fair way, we can do what is \nnecessary to get a balanced budget. So we have changed forever the \nprofligacy of a great Nation, and we ought to be proud of it and \nthankful for it.\n  To all the chairmen who worked so hard, thank you. I want to close \nand say to our leader, Senator Dole, thank you for all the confidence \nyou placed in me. When I had to get things done, you told me ``do \nthem.'' When I needed tough decisions and I could not get the votes, \nyou said, ``Bring them in my office.'' And last, I thank the \nbudgeteers. You have a tough job; you do not get to pass anything \nexcept this crazy resolution that cuts everything, but I thank you for \nyour unity and your support. It has been a privilege being your \nchairman. Thank you very much.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Democratic \nleader is recognized for a period of not to exceed 5 minutes.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I yield 2 minutes to the Senator from New \nJersey.\n  Mr. BRADLEY. Mr. President, this reconciliation bill, from top to \nbottom, is intoxicated with the fantasy that it is abandoning the \nwelfare state. Mr. President, we do not have a welfare state, we have a \nsafety net for a few poor people. This drives big holes in that safety \nnet. Welfare reform--block grants replace welfare. What it does is take \nmoney from Federal pols and give it to State pols. The theory is, if \nyou do not like Washington, you are going to love Lansing, or Trenton, \nor the State capital. Hardly. What this does is, in the Federal \ncommitment to poor children, 1.2 million more children will be plunged \ninto poverty because of this. The Medicaid block grant. Send it all \nback to the States. Do not say who is eligible, and do not say what the \nbenefits will be, or how the providers will provide the benefits. Just \nsend the money back.\n  The only thing we know is that when we pass this bill, 12 million \nAmericans will be uninsured. Uninsured. I predict that, 5 years from \nnow, there will be Medicaid scandals in States where Governors are \nputting in a health care program that will help their constituencies.\n  Why are State governments different? They are not. For what purpose? \nThe purpose is that we are giving a gigantic break to wealthy \nAmericans. On the other side, they say, ``Oh, no, only 35 percent of \nthe cut goes to people above $75,000.'' Yes, but they only represent 13 \npercent of the people. And embedded in this bill for estates of $2.5 \nmillion is an $800,000 tax cut. At the same time, we are ripping holes \nin the safety net, we are giving estates of $2.5 million an $800,000 \ntax cut. We should say ``no.''\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I want to commend the distinguished \nranking member for the excellent job he has done in representing our \ncaucus and commend all of the Members who have played a role in on our \nside, as we have debated this bill.\n  I believe that this is the most dangerous document in America. I \nbelieve it is one of the most extreme documents that we have had before \nthis Congress in the time that I have served here. When the lowest 20 \npercent of the people in this country lose more than all the other 80 \npercent combined, that is extreme. When the upper 20 percent gain more \nthan all the other 80 percent combined, that is extreme.\n  When you see the biggest shift in income from the middle class to the \ntop brackets in history--Mr. President, there is no other word to \ndescribe it but extreme. When it represents the biggest cut in health \ncare benefits in history, Mr. President, this document belongs in the \nGuinness Book of World Records.\n  The American people did not vote to see the kind of change this \ndocument represents. No one in this country voted to gut Medicare $270 \nbillion to provide tax breaks for those who do not need them. No one \nvoted to cut Medicaid $163 billion to provide tax breaks for those who \ndo not need them.\n  The distinguished Senator from New Mexico talked about protecting our \nchildren. How in Heaven's name do we protect our children when we cut \nthe legs out from under them in education, in student loans, in \nnutrition programs, in housing, in virtually every single area of \nopportunity this country has provided them--how do we do that? How in \nthe name of children can we stand up and support this document?\n  Mr. President, we can do better than this. The American people now by \nmore than a 2 to 1 margin believe--demand--we do better than this. The \nPresident will veto it, and he has good reason to veto it.\n  We need to sit down together and take the extreme measures out of \nthis document. We need to work to govern better. We need to send a \nbetter message to the American people.\n  We will not gut the investments in people that we have committed to \nfor a long, long time. The most dangerous document in America needs to \nbe vetoed and, indeed, it will be.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order the majority leader \nis recognized for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I think probably the most extreme thing that \nhas happened in the last 2 or 3 years is \n\n[[Page S 17329]]\nthe $265 billion tax increase passed by this Congress without a single \nRepublican vote. You talk about extremism--that is a good example, \nparticularly when the initiator confesses that he raised taxes too \nmuch, the President of the United States.\n  I believe we have a good package here. We have had a lot of work, and \nI want to thank, first of all, Senator Domenici and the entire Budget \nCommittee, but everyone else on this side of the aisle who have been \nworking the past several weeks to bring us to this moment.\n  I really believe, and I am sitting here thinking I have cast a lot of \nvotes in the U.S. Senate. I think this is probably the most important \none that I will cast, knowing it is not bipartisan. I would like to \nhave it bipartisan. But it is a very important vote. It is a \nfundamental change in America. It is a fundamental change in direction \nin this country. I think it is probably the most important vote I have \ncast in my years in the Senate.\n  I have never been so certain that we are doing something right--yes, \nright--for our children, as the Senator from New Mexico pointed out, \nfor our grandchildren, and for everybody else.\n  It is right for States. Yes, we are giving some power back to the \nGovernors. We are following the admonition of the 10th amendment of the \nConstitution, part of the Bill of Rights, 28 words in length, that \nsays, in effect, if the power is not reserved to the Federal Government \nit belongs to the States and to the people. We believe when the people \ngave us a majority last November, they wanted us to give power back to \nthe States and back to the people.\n\n  This bill is right for senior citizens. We will save, preserve, and \nstrengthen Medicare. It will still grow at a rate of 6.4 percent. We \nbelieve that is a step in the right direction.\n  But looking at other beneficiaries, somebody who buys a home will \nsave a lot of money because interest rates will come down. If you buy a \ncar, if you are going to buy farm machinery, if you take out a loan to \nsend your child to college, or if you are trapped in a failed welfare \nsystem--not anyone in this body would say we do not have a failed \nwelfare system.\n  It seems to me that if we are going to promise to end business as \nusual, we have to start putting up or shutting up. We cannot do all of \nthe things that my colleagues on the other side say--keep spending more \nmoney, spending more money, more taxes, more regulations, more \ngovernment--and ever make a fundamental shift in America.\n  I hope, again, knowing the bill is going to be vetoed, but I hope the \nAmerican people know that we are not going to mortgage their future \nwith this bill; that we are going to cut taxes for families with \nchildren; we are going to encourage savings and investment and economic \ngrowth. We have kept our promise. We kept our promise to shift power \nout of Washington, DC, to the States, and we have kept our promise \nthere.\n  I just conclude, because I know there are some of us going to another \ndebate, and some are getting nervous, which is all right with me, but I \nsimply ask the President of the United States to take another look at \nthis product. This is a good product, Mr. President. You ought to sign \nit. You ought to make up for all the things you have done wrong in the \npast 3 years and sign this bill. Then you would be right on target \nagain. You would be that new Democrat you wanted to be or thought you \nwere or might have been.\n  Mr. President, we are doing the right thing. We are doing it because \nwe stuck together, because we kept our promise, and because we love \nAmerica.\n  Mr. President, soon after my election to the Kansas State House of \nRepresentatives, a reporter asked me whether I had a legislative \nagenda. And I replied that my agenda was simple--it was to stand up for \nwhat I thought was right.\n  And I have tried to follow that philosophy throughout my career.\n  In just a few minutes I will vote to approve the Balanced Budget Act \nof 1995.\n  I believe the vote is one of the most historic votes ever taken in \nthis Chamber--and certainly the most important one I have cast in my \nyears in the Senate.\n  And as I cast my vote to approve this landmark legislation, I can say \nthat I have never been so certain that I am standing up for what's \nright.\n  I have never been so certain that the U.S. Senate is standing up for \nwhat is right.\n  Mr. President, the Balanced Budget Amendment Act of 1995 is right for \nAmerica's future.\n  It is right for the American people.\n  It is right for our children and grandchildren.\n  It is right for our States, our cities, and our neighborhoods.\n  It is right for our senior citizens.\n  It is right for every American who is saving to buy a home.\n  It is right for every American who is buying a car.\n  It is right for every American who takes out a loan to send a child \nto college.\n  It is right for those trapped in our failed welfare system.\n  Mr. President, last fall, Republicans asked voters to give us a \nmajority on Capitol Hill. And we left absolutely no doubt about what we \nwould do if we got that majority.\n  We promised we would put an end to business as usual. Tonight, \nAmericans know that we have kept our promise.\n  We promised to stop the mortgaging of our children's and \ngrandchildren's future, and to put America on a path to a balanced \nbudget. Tonight, Americans know that we have kept our promise.\n  We promised to replace our failed welfare system with one based on \nthe principles of work, family, and personal responsibility. Tonight, \nAmericans know that we have kept our promise.\n  We promised to cut taxes for America's families, and to encourage \nsavings, investment, and economic growth. Tonight, Americans know that \nwe have kept our promise.\n  We promised to shift power out of Washington, DC, and to return it to \nwhere it belongs--our States, our cities, and our people. And tonight \nAmericans know that we have kept our promise.\n  A balanced budget. True welfare reform. Lower taxes. More freedom and \npower for our States, our cities, and our people. That's what \nRepublicans are all about. And that's what this bill is all about.\n  President Clinton has said that he will veto this bill. He will, as \nis his habit, stand in the way of change. And I would simply say to the \nPresident to take another look at this bill.\n  We are told that the President's pollsters are advising him that the \nAmerican people have concluded that his actions don't match his words. \nBy signing this bill, President Clinton would prove that his actions do \nmatch his words on a number of issues.\n  President Clinton has told the American people many, many times that \nhe is for a balanced budget.\n  He said on June 4, 1992 he would balance the budget in 5 years.\n  He said on May 20, 1995, he could balance the budget in less than 10 \nyears.\n  He said on June 13, 1995, he would take 10 years.\n  And on October 19, 1995 he said he could balance it in either 7 \nyears, 8 years, or 9 years.\n  Despite these claims, President Clinton did everything he could to \ndefeat a balanced budget amendment, and the Congressional Budget \nOffice-- which the President has previously endorsed as an honest \nscorekeeper--has said that the budgets the President did propose left \nus with $200 million in deficits far into the next century.\n  President Clinton said in 1992 that he would end welfare as we know \nit. Yet, he admitted recently that the only welfare bill he proposed \nwas a disappointment.\n  The President promised in 1992 that he would give middle-class \nAmericans a tax cut. Yet, in 1993 he gave America the largest tax \nincrease in history.\n  The President said that he wants to prevent Medicare from going \nbankrupt, as three of his Cabinet members have projected it will do \nwithin 7 years. Yet, he has refused to work in a bi-partisan manner \nwith Republicans to save Medicare. Instead, according to a remarkable \neditorial in the Washington Post, the President has ``shamelessly used \nthe Medicare issue * * * demagogued on it * * * and taken to the \nairwaves with a slick scare program.''\n  So, Americans have every reason to be confused. Just where does the \nPresident stand on balancing the budget? Where does he stand on \nreforming welfare? Where does he stand on cutting \n\n[[Page S 17330]]\ntaxes for America's families? Where does he stand on saving Medicare?\n  The President's decision on this bill will, once and for all, clear \nup all confusion. Because by signing this bill, the President will \nfinally allow his actions to match his words. But by vetoing it, he \nwill make very clear that he is against a balanced budget, and the \nbenefits it will bring. He is against welfare reform. He is against tax \nreduction. He is against saving Medicare.\n  And by vetoing this bill, the President will be against many other \nprovisions. He will be against a capital gains tax cut. He will be \nagainst putting an end to the marriage penalty tax. He will be against \nmedical savings accounts. He will be against adoption tax credits. He \nwill be against helping Americans who provide care to their parents.\n  Now, when President Clinton vetoes this bill, he will shake his head, \nand he will say what many of his liberal allies have said today. He \nwill say that he would like to sign this bill, but it's just too harsh. \nHe will say that we are cutting spending on programs for the less \nfortunate among us. He will say we are cutting Medicare. He will say \nour tax cuts favor the business community.\n  He will say all that again and again. And he will be wrong every time \nhe says it.\n  He will be wrong because this bill does not cut overall Federal \nspending--it allows it to grow by 22 percent over the next 7 years.\n  He will be wrong because this bill does not cut Medicare. In fact, \nMedicare will continue to grow at a rate of 7.7 percent a year.\n  He will be wrong because this bill does not cut programs to the \nneedy--it allows 34 percent growth over the next 7 years.\n  He will be wrong because total funding for student loans will be \nincreased by nearly 50 percent over the next 7 years.\n  He will be wrong because 73 percent of the tax cuts in this bill will \nhelp families throughout their lives.\n  Those are the facts. The President will try his best to obscure these \nfacts with emotional rhetoric. In fact, the Democrat National Committee \nalready has a television commercial on the air trumpeting the \nPresident's so-called balanced budget proposal, and saying that the \nRepublican plan will cut Medicare.\n  It's a nice commercial with catchy music, but not a word of it is \ntrue. As I have said, the President has never submitted a budget \nanywhere near balance. And the Republican plan increases Medicare \nspending.\n  Mr. President, I'm from a farm State, and I want to say to the \nfarmers of Kansas and the farmers of America that this bill is also \nimportant to them.\n  Since the days of Franklin Roosevelt, the Government has been in the \nbusiness of telling farmers how to farm. Under this bill, that will \nend, and beginning in 1996, farmers will be planting for the market \nplace.\n  Under this bill, farmers will have full planting flexibility, \nelimination of set-asides, program simplicity, and a farm policy that \ntransitions farmers into the next century without disrupting the farm \neconomy or land values.\n  While I am concerned about farmers receiving payments in good years, \nI am pleased we were able to cap the entitlement spending of \nagriculture programs. We accomplish this goal through a declining \ntransition payment which is guaranteed to the farmer. In exchange, \nfarmers will be required to maintain their land conservation efforts in \nboth good and bad years. And this bill also protects family farms by \nproviding some much needed estate tax relief.\n  Mr. President, let me conclude by saying that I know that the \nAmerican people have wondered about the events taking place in \nWashington this week. They have wondered why the Government was shut \ndown. They have wondered why Congress and the White House aren't \ntalking to each other.\n  Well, as I have said many times this week, I wonder why we haven't \nspent more time talking to each other. And I remain ready to talk with \nthe President any time to put all Federal employees back to work.\n  But I also would tell Americans that if ever there was a debate you \nwanted your elected Representatives to have, this is it. This is it. \nBecause we are debating your future. We are debating the future of your \nchildren and grandchildren. We are debating the future of America.\n  I speak for all Republicans in saying that, as we approach \nThanksgiving, we are thankful to have the opportunity to stand for \nsomething.\n  We are thankful to have the opportunity to stand for fundamental \nchange.\n  We are thankful to have the opportunity to stand for a better future \nfor the next generation of Americans.\n  And let me close by saying--and I know I speak for all Members of the \nSenate--that we are thankful that we have the opportunity to serve with \na Senator as courageous and committed as Pete Domenici, and I salute \nhim for his many years of leadership in support of a balanced budget.\n  Mr. President, let's do the right thing for America's future. Let's \npass the Balanced Budget Act of 1995.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader is informed the yeas and \nnays have not been ordered.\n  Mr. DOLE.

Mr. President, I think many of us were shocked to read \ntoday that the commander of U.S. forces in the Pacific called the \nrecent rape of a 12-year-old Okinawan girl ``absolutely \n\n[[Page S 17331]]\nstupid,'' and said Friday the incident could have been avoided if the \nU.S. servicemen had simply paid for sex. The commander of the Pacific \nfleet in essence said, if they had taken the money that they spent to \nbuy a van, they could have bought a girl.\n  Mr. President, that is a sickening statement, and I want to commend \nmy colleague from California, Senator Feinstein, for responding very \nquickly when she heard of this. And what she said is very important. \nWhat she said is that rape is not about sex, and it is not about money. \nIt is a violent act.\n  I am very pleased that on the floor this evening is the author of the \nViolence Against Women Act, Senator Biden of Delaware. I was so honored \nwhen I was in the House to be coauthor and carried the bill on that \nside, and after many years the bill became law.\n  But I say to my colleagues that until this attitude changes, until \npeople view rape as a violent act--it is about power, it is about the \nabuse of power--then we are never going to make any progress.\n  For the commander of the Pacific fleet to have said this--and he did \napologize, I am happy to say--it is extraordinary. I only hope that the \nSecretary of Defense will take proper action in this matter.\n  Mr. President, I know others will speak about this tonight. But I am \ngoing to shift very briefly to another subject.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/11/17/senate-section/article/S17330-1", "month": "11", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "17", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S17331]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            NO BUDGET-NO PAY\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, we are in day 4 of the partial shutdown of \nthe Federal Government. It is causing harm to many people in this \ncountry who require and need the services of the Federal Government, be \nthey veteran, be they the elderly, or be they the business community. \nOne example is someone desperately needed a passport in order to \nconduct some very important business for a small business, was denied \nit, and missed a chance maybe at the American dream. So we are dealing \nwith a very serious circumstance.\n  There is 1 Federal employee who is getting paid during this period. \nThey are all getting docked except for the Members of the Senate and \nthe Members of the House.\n  I took to the floor last night with Senator Snowe and Senator Harkin \nto protest this situation. Where we stand is that the bill, the no \nbudget-no pay bill, is stuck in the DC conference. And who knows? It \nmay never emerge because the Speaker of the House is not pushing the no \nbudget-no pay bill.\n  Senator Snowe and I authored another bill, and we have been trying to \nget it before this body. The Republican side of the aisle has objected. \nMaybe they will not object tonight. Last night, the excuse was, gee, \neveryone had to go home. We cannot take it up. Well, what about today? \nWe waited. Senator Snowe was working hard to get it through. We could \nnot get it.\n  Some of my colleagues are making charitable contributions. Some are \nleaving their money in escrow. Some are giving it back. And that is \nnoble. But this is not about the good guys doing something; this is \nabout institutional failure.\n  In case, my colleague, you want to know what people think about this, \nlook at the poll in the San Francisco Examiner. They put out a \ntelephone poll, and it came back today. Eighty-nine percent say we \nshould not get our pay during the shutdown. By the way, they included \nthe President, which our bill includes, and 11 percent say we should. \nThat 11 percent maybe is our relatives.\n\n  But I have to tell you. This is a total and complete outrage. We \nshould be treated like every other Federal employee. Our staffs are \nworking into the night, and they are being docked. But not us.\n  So I ask unanimous consent that the Senate immediately proceed \ntonight to the Snowe-Boxer bill. I make that request.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Further, since it has been objected to, I ask unanimous \nconsent that we go to the Snowe-Boxer bill the first thing in the \nmorning.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Let me just say, is the time mine, Mr. President?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is no time. The Senator from California \nhas the floor.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Thank you very much. I want to express my disappointment \nand my despair of this. We should not treat ourselves better than our \nown staff. We should not treat ourselves better than the good people \nwho work for the Federal Government. I think now that we finally have \nseen the light here. There was an objection yesterday, there is an \nobjection today, there is an objection for tomorrow, and I will be back \nin the morning making the same unanimous-consent request.\n  I am sad to say--I thought the Senate was bipartisan on this. Senator \nSnowe has 27 Members in a bipartisan way on this bill, but you hear \nobjection from the leadership, the Republican leadership, of the \nSenate. And I hope people let them know that they are wrong, that this \nis wrong.\n  Mr. BIDEN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. BIDEN. I will be brief. I know the Republican whip wants to \nspeak.\n  Mr. President, I do not want to repeat what I said last night. I \nagree with Senator Boxer, Senator Snowe, and Senator Harkin about the \nfact that we should not be getting paid. I will not elaborate. I think \nit speaks for itself. It is clear.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/11/17/senate-section/article/S17331-1", "month": "11", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "17", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S17331-S17332]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            THE OKINAWA RAPE\n\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I want to speak very briefly to something \nthat was called to my attention only an hour or 2 hours ago. That is, \naccording to the wire services, Admiral Macke said, and I quote, with \nregard to the case where two Marines and a Navy seaman are on trial in \nOkinawa on charges that they abducted a 12-year-old girl on September 4 \nin a rental car, drove her to a secluded sugar cane field where one of \nthe persons, Seaman Marcus D. Gill, admitted in court that he had raped \nthe girl.\n  In response to that incident, which has international consequences \nfor us, it is probably the most significant disagreement we have had \nwith Japan, including trade agreements, caused as much of a stir and \noutrage, and understandable stir and outrage, on the part of the \nJapanese.\n  This admiral, probably one of the two or three most visible people \nknown by name in Japan, because he is head of the Pacific Fleet, \ninstead of him getting off of his ship, getting in a car and going to \nwherever the hell that family or the relatives of that child lived, and \nbegging the forgiveness on the part of this Nation for something in the \nnature that occurred back when Attila the Hun came down into Japan and \nraped and pillaged centuries ago, instead of doing that, this fellow \nsays--if this is true, this guy should be disciplined. If any one of us \nsaid this, it would be enough, in my view, for the voters to never vote \nfor us again. If it were a Cabinet Member, we would probably dismiss \nthem. We have had Cabinet Members dismissed for less insensitive things \nthan this.\n  He says--if this is true, because what the press says is not always \ntrue; so that is the one caveat that I will make--but if he said, ``I \nthink that it was absolutely stupid, I've said several times,'' Macke \nsaid, ``for the price they paid to rent the car they could have had a \ngirl.''\n  I realize I am accused, rightfully so, by my colleagues on occasion \nof being a little too emotional, but I want to tell you, if that were \nmy daughter and that admiral said that, I would go find the son--I \nwould go find him. I would look for him. I would--it would not be \nright; I would be wrong; it would be a violation of law--but I would \nfind him and rip his ears off, if I could, or get killed in trying.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. BIDEN. I will yield to my friend from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I share my friend's anger. Where was this--how was this \nreport carried?\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, it is carried by the AP Wire Service. Date: \nThe 17th, today, 19:22 hours, Eastern Standard Time, Copyright 1995. \nAll rights reserved, AM----\n  Mr. McCAIN. I thank my friend. The AP.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Again, I will publicly apologize--I want to make this \ncaveat. \n\n[[Page S 17332]]\n If he did not say this, then this is unwarranted, what I am saying. \nBut I just do not think that after all the time and all the effort we \nhave made here, the men in the Senate--not just the women in the \nSenate--the men in the Senate, the people on this floor, to deal with \nthe Violence Against Women Act, which is all about changing attitudes--\nand my friend, the Senator from the State of Arizona, I know how he \nfeels about these things. I know how he votes on these things. I know \nhow the Senator from Mississippi and the Senator from Iowa feel about \nthis. We have tried very hard to change attitudes, attitudes about \nwomen and whether or not women are property, whether or not women are \n``our woman,'' whether or not we men have a right to ever touch them. \nThat has been a central debate in this Nation.\n  And to have one of the highest ranking military officers of the \nUnited States of America saying--in command of thousands of young, \nimpressionable men--that his response to this tragedy, instead of being \nan instinctive gut-wrenching anger and empathy, is, ``They could have \ngotten a girl.'' Why would he do this? That is simple. Unfortunately, \nwe know a fair number of people think like this. ``This is kind of \ndumb. If they wanted sex, they could have gotten and bought it in \nOkinawa for the price they rented the car. That is a reasonable \ncalculation, is it not?''\n\n  And until recently, the last decade or so, that was kind of an \naccepted notion. ``We should think of these things logically.'' Well, \nmy God, it is absolutely--I mean, all the debates that we have had on \nthe floor, all the times--and, Mr. President, if there is anyone who is \nguilty of ``hoof in mouth'' disease, if there is anyone who has stuck \nhis foot in his mouth more than this Senator, if there is anybody that \nhas made more verbal faux pas than me, I do not know.\n  I challenge anyone to think, in 23 years, of any time I have gotten \nup on the floor and criticized someone like this for misspeaking, \nbecause I am a champion at it, I have made a career of it, \nunfortunately, but, thank God, never on something like this, never on \nsomething that has affected someone, affected the representation of the \nphilosophy of a nation.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. BIDEN. I will be glad to yield.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I thank the Senate for bringing this to my attention. I \nnever heard of this, like the Senator from Arizona. I can say, as \nsomeone who spent 4 years in the Navy ROTC, 5 years as a Navy pilot on \nactive duty, 3 more years in the Active Reserve flying for the Navy--\nthat adds up to a lot of time in the Navy--I have an instinctive pride \nin the Navy. We all do, those of us who served. And I love the Navy. I \nlove its rich history. But I must say to the Senator from Delaware, \nthat if this is true--I just heard this; I went over and read the AP \nwire report that the Senator had--I say, if this is true, if this is \nwhat Admiral Macke said, I would go the Senator one better. It is not \nthat he should be disciplined. Our Commander in Chief, the Commander in \nChief of the Armed Forces of the United States, which is the President \nof the United States, ought to bring him to Washington and publicly \nstrip him of his rank and take away his commission in the U.S. Navy.\n  The Commander in Chief of the Armed Forces, the President of the \nUnited States, has the power to do that. And I call upon President \nClinton, if this is true--and I share the Senator's thought--I want to \nmake sure that he actually said that. If Admiral Macke said that, I \ncall upon President Clinton to bring Admiral Macke to Washington, strip \nhim of his rank, take away his commission, and deny him all the \nbenefits that he has accrued as a naval officer to send a signal to \nevery other naval officer that this kind of action, this kind of \nattitude, will never be tolerated again in the United States Navy.\n  I thank the Senator for bringing this to our attention. It is a sad \nday for those of us who so dearly love the United States Navy.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I will not take any more time--I see the \nRepublican leader--except to say it was not--I cannot take credit or \nblame for bringing this to the attention of the Senate. It was the \nSenator from California. But let me just say, to look at it the other \nway around, let us assume that Japanese troops--let me give it an \nanalogy. When the Prime Minister of Japan made a reference several \nyears ago that the reason why we were not productive is because of race \nrelations with our black population, this country, understandably, was \nin a furor. And it ended up being one of the elements to bring down \nthat Prime Minister in his own country.\n  Let me just ask the rhetorical question--and I will yield the floor \nafter I do--what do we think we would do if a 12-year-old girl was \ndriven to a cornfield in any one of our States by three Japanese \nservicemen stationed in the United States of America, was brutally \nraped, and one of the Japanese sailors saying, ``I did it,'' in open \ncourt, and then the commander of the Japanese fleet, sitting off of San \nDiego, said in an interview with American reporters, that ``This was \nstupid on the part of the Japanese sailors. All they had to do was, for \nthe money they had to rent a car in San Diego, they could have went and \ngotten a girl and had her''?\n  Can you imagine the indignation of this Nation? There would be every \nother Senator on the floor of this Nation demanding a public apology \nand action taken against that admiral. I just think sometimes we do not \nunderstand that what is good for the goose is good for the gander. We \ndo not understand how people feel. We never put ourselves in their \nshoes.\n  And I will say, if we had a problem with United States-Japanese \nrelations before, as a consequence of this rape, just what are they \nnow? Purely in terms of the United States naked self-interest in the \nrelations with Japan, what has this guy done, if this is true?\n  I think it is deplorable. I do not know--I am not as certain as my \nfriend from Iowa what the appropriate action is--but I just think as a \nNation, we should be publicly apologizing to the people of Japan and we \nshould be publicly vilifying anyone who says things like this.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. HARKIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/11/17/senate-section/article/S17331-2", "month": "11", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "17", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S17332]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         THE BAD DEBT BOXSCORE\n\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, on that evening in 1972 when I first was \nelected to the Senate, I made a commitment to myself that I would never \nfail to see a young person, or a group of young people, who wanted to \nsee me.\n  It has proved enormously beneficial to me because I have been \ninspired by the estimated 60,000 young people with whom I have visited \nduring the nearly 23 years I have been in the Senate.\n  Most of them have been concerned about the total Federal debt which \nis slightly in excess of $11 billion shy of $5 trillion (which will be \nexceeded later this year). Of course, Congress is responsible for \ncreating this monstrosity for which the coming generations will have to \npay.\n  The young people and I almost always discuss the fact that under the \nU.S. Constitution, no President can spend a dime of Federal money that \nhas not first been authorized and appropriated by both the House and \nSenate of the United States.\n  That is why I began making these daily reports to the Senate on \nFebruary 25, 1992. I wanted to make a matter of daily record the \nprecise size of the Federal debt which, at the close of business \nyesterday, Thursday, November 16, stood at $4,989,792,104,452.15 or \n$18,941.34 for every man, woman, and child in America on a per capita \nbasis.\n  The increase in the national debt since my report yesterday (which \nidentified the total Federal debt as of close of business on Wednesday, \nNovember 15, 1995) shows an increase of $1,452,054,077.58.

On March 22, President Clinton signed \ninto law Senate Bill 1, a bill to stop unfunded Federal mandates on \nState and \n\n[[Page S 17333]]\nlocal governments. At that time, this country's elected leaders \naffirmed their belief in the 10th Amendment.\n  The National Highway System bill continues that commitment by \nstopping not only future mandates, but by addressing current mandates. \nIn fact, section 205, ``Relief from Mandates,'' speaks clearly to that \nconcern.\n  The No. 1 issue for the Idaho Department of Transportation in this \nbill is the suspension of the Management Systems provision that burdens \nthem with onerous paperwork requirements. They're spending valuable \ntime and resources on federally-mandated paperwork instead of doing the \nwork on roads, bridges and other needed projects. This bill frees the \nStates from excessive Federal bureaucracy.\n  S. 440 removes the federally-mandated crumb rubber asphalt \nrequirement. In some States, like Idaho, crumb rubber in road surfaces \njust doesn't work. The climatic conditions aren't right. That's not to \nsay crumb rubber won't work somewhere else. In this bill we turn the \nmandate into a grant program to encourage pilot projects so any State \nthat wants to utilize recycled tires in their road projects may do so. \nBut the key is, the States will have that option. I need to \ncongratulate Chairman Chafee for developing this innovative grant \nprogram.\n  This legislation also allows States to set their own maximum speed \nlimits. Some will argue that this is a threat to public safety. I say \nthis is not anti-safety, it's pro-States rights. We have 50 governors, \nState legislatures, and law enforcement agencies that can determine \nwhat is the best and safest for their citizens. They care just as much \nas those of us in Washington, DC do about safety. But there are parts \nof Idaho where conditions may permit a different speed limit. Congress \nmust let those local authorities decide what's best.\n  Another mandate we eliminate is the penalties for non-compliance of \nmotorcycle helmet laws. Now I'm not one to advocate unsafe usage of any \nmotor vehicle, but I think it's wrong to blackmail a State by \nthreatening to withhold Federal highway funds if they don't strictly \nenforce a Federal helmet law. Once again, State police authorities and \nlawmakers in each of our 50 States knows what's the best for their \nresidents.\n  S. 440 establishes designation of thousands of miles of highways \nunder the Federal system, making them eligible for Federal funding--\n$6.5 billion in highway funds will be released to States as soon as \nthis bill is signed into law. Under this bill, States will be able to \naddress their most pressing highway and bridge repair and construction \nprojects. Nearly 90 percent of all American residents will live within \nfive miles of an NHS route. That is good for rural States like my home \nState of Idaho. Improved and efficient road systems will speed up \ncommerce and trade and will be an economic boon for our cities, \ncounties and businesses.\n  Another benefit for the motoring public is the public-private \npartnership for safety. S. 440 allows public companies to install \nemergency roadside telephone call boxes. I'm pleased that the conferees \naccepted my amendment requiring at least 20 percent of those call boxes \nbe installed in rural areas. My State of Idaho has hundreds of miles of \nisolated highways. In many of these areas, a phone could be a lifesaver \nfor a stranded motorist. I would like to see more of these partnerships \nutilized by this Congress to meet important needs.\n  Finally, Mr. President, I'm proud that this bill finally provides \nfunding for the National Recreational Trails Act. I take great pride in \ncompleting the task begun by my good friend and predecessor, Steve \nSymms, who is the author of the Recreational Trails Act. Unfortunately, \nCongress has been collecting money from off-road vehicle gasoline taxes \nfor this program, but has not made it available for trails. This bill \nprovides $30 million over the next 2 years for States to build, repair, \nand maintain hiking, biking, snowmobile, equestrian, and off road \nvehicle trails. States will also have the money too for recreational \ntrails that are accessible to our disabled citizens.\n  I hope the President signs this bill. It is a winner for all \nAmericans. And, it does not raise one dime in taxes. This bill utilizes \nthe funds already collected from our nation's motorists and deposited \nin the highway trust fund. We need to get those dollars out of the bank \nand into the States where they can do the most good.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/11/17/senate-section/article/S17332-2", "month": "11", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "17", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S17333]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        A TRIBUTE TO TERI ELLIS\n\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Mr. President, I rise today to extend my \ncongratulations to Teri Ellis, an exceptional South Dakotan. President \nBill Clinton recently named Teri the travel and tourism employee of the \nyear.\n   Teri is executive director of the Sioux Falls Convention and \nVisitors Bureau. I am not at all surprised that Teri has been chosen \nfor the award. Teri has shown extraordinary dedication and service in \npromoting the South Dakota tourism industry. Teri also has been a \ntireless promoter of the convention center currently being built in \nSioux Falls, SD. She believes that the tourism industry must remain \ncompetitive, convenient, and have a thorough marketing plan. She is \nabsolutely right.\n  The tourism industry plays a vital role in the economic development \nof South Dakota. Tourism has been very important to my State in the \npast and will continue to be in the future. I can say with confidence \nthat South Dakota tourism will thrive for years to come because Teri \nEllis will continue to be a strong force in a thriving and productive \ntourism industry for South Dakota and the Nation. I thank Teri for her \ngreat work on behalf of South Dakota tourism and wish her continued \nsuccess.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that an article be printed in \nthe Record from the Sioux Falls Argus Leader acknowledging Teri Ellis' \nrecent award.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n           [From the Sioux Falls Argus Leader, Oct. 31, 1995]\n\n                 Promoter Named Top Employee by Clinton\n\n                        (By Brenda Wade Schmidt)\n\n       A Sioux Falls promoter was named travel and tourism \n     employee of the year Monday by President Bill Clinton.\n       Teri Ellis, executive director of the Sioux Falls \n     Convention & Visitors Bureau, was in Washington, D.C., at the \n     White House Conference on Travel and Tourism, the first for \n     the Clinton administration.

HISTORIAN\n\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Mr. President, as the United Nations celebrates 50 \nyears in operation, I am reminded of the rich history of the \ninternational organization--a history filled with challenges, \ncriticism, and hope for many war-torn areas of the world. As my \ncolleagues know, I have been a supporter of the U.N. as well as an \noutspoken critic of its wasteful and abusive management practices. \nWhile waste, fraud, and abuse still run rampant within the world body, \nthese mismanagement practices should not overshadow the valiant efforts \nof dedicated public servants to do the right thing at the United \nNations.\n  Ambassador Joseph Verner-Reed, U.N. Under-Secretary-General for \nPublic Affairs, is one such committed public servant. Throughout his \nmany years at the United Nations, he has worked tirelessly to promote \npeace and stability in our chaotic world.\n  During his service to the United Nations, the Ambassador has compiled \na wealth of knowledge about the United Nations and its history. In \nresponse to the golden anniversary of the United Nations, Greenwich \nMagazine talked \n\n[[Page S 17334]]\nwith Ambassador Reed about what he viewed to be the most notable events \nof the U.N.'s past 50 years. The Greenwich Magazine recently published \nthe Ambassador's rich, detailed account of U.N. history. For example, \nReed describes the famous 1960 Khrushchev shoe-banging incident and the \ntime in 1994 when the United Nations monitored the historic, peaceful \nelections in South Africa following the end of Apartheid.\n  I can think of few others who could offer a better account of \nhistorical events at the United Nations than Joseph Verner-Reed. He is \na devoted man, who cares deeply about the United Nations and the people \nit serves around the globe. Mr. President, in tribute to my friend, \nAmbassador Reed, I ask unanimous consent to place Tanya Hochschild's \narticle, ``Highlights of U.N. History'' from the Greenwich Magazine in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the Greenwich Magazine, May 1995]\n\n                       Highlights of U.N. History\n\n                         (By Tanya Hochschild)\n\n       Television brings the world's wars into our living rooms \n     and we witness the horror. In the last five years, we have \n     watched a brutal war in Bosnia, been with our troops as they \n     landed on the beach in Somalia, seen the hell of Rwanda and \n     Liberia, the crises in the Middle East and in Haiti. These \n     images remind us we live in an unstable world, a world of \n     violence, of human abuses and inhumanity.\n       In the eye of these international storms is the United \n     Nations, monitoring, intervening, trying to keep the peace. \n     This year the world organization celebrates its golden \n     jubilee. Yet many who have seen the slaughter have less than \n     an enthusiastic response to the efficacy of the U.N. during \n     the past fifty years. These are not the sentiments, however, \n     of Ambassador Joseph Verner Reed, under-secretary-general for \n     Public Affairs at the United Nations and one of the highest \n     ranking American officials at the world organization. (The \n     ambassador had served as under-secretary-general for \n     Political and General Assembly Affairs and Secretariat \n     Services from 1986 to 1988, when he was asked to be chief of \n     protocol by President George Bush. He had previously served \n     President Reagan as ambassador to Morocco.)\n       Relaxing at his home, Denbigh Farm in backcountry \n     Greenwich, Ambassador Reed talked about some memorable \n     moments in the history of the United Nations. He considers \n     himself a citizen of the world, with his first allegiance to \n     the world organization. ``I want to be very clear. I will \n     always serve as an international civil servant, so my optic \n     is different from that of a U.S. national.''\n       On the occasion of the fiftieth anniversary of the United \n     Nations, Ambassador Reed found it both difficult and easy to \n     limit his reflections to only a few highlights in its \n     history. Difficult, because he is so unabashedly a proud and \n     enthusiastic U.N. man--and has such a fund of stories, whose \n     telling remind him of ten others. Easy, because he is a \n     consummate diplomat, courteous, elegant, knowledgeable. A man \n     whose acuity and aplomb enables him to communicate succinctly \n     all he wants you to hear. Nevertheless, when pinned down, he \n     mentioned eight significant dates:\n       December 10, 1948.--The General Assembly adopts the \n     Universal Declaration of Human Rights.\n       The United Nations has helped enact agreements on \n     political, civil, economic, social and cultural rights. \n     Complaints of human rights abuses are investigated and the \n     U.N. Human Rights Commission has focused the world's \n     attention on cases of torture and arbitrary detention.\n       ``That document is a benchmark of success, one of the great \n     pieces of high thinking for our planet,'' said Ambassador \n     Reed. ``It set a standard for other declarations such as the \n     one on women's rights, which improves the quality of life for \n     women in over 100 countries. Programs helped raise the female \n     literacy rate in developing countries from thirty-six percent \n     in 1970 to fifty-six percent in 1990.''\n       October 24, 1949.--Cornerstone laid for United Nations \n     headquarters in New York City.\n       While Ambassador Joseph Verner Reed is a dedicated \n     international civil servant, he expresses sentiments about \n     his own country that leave the listener in no doubt as to his \n     feelings about the United States.\n       ``Every American, man, woman and child should be very proud \n     of the incredible contribution the United States has made to \n     the United Nations. Our country, the host country, has played \n     a pivotal role in the management of the world organization, \n     not the least of which has been assuming obligation for \n     twenty-five percent of the regular budget. In 1948 Congress \n     approved an interest-free loan of sixty-five million dollars \n     for the headquarters building. The site is a gift (tax \n     deductible, yes) from the Rockefellers.''\n       November 6, 1956.--The first U.N. peace-keeping force \n     established.\n       ``Obviously peace keeping is an extraordinary success, and \n     an ongoing attempt to meet the challenges of a troubled \n     world,'' the ambassador said. ``We have thirty-five peace-\n     keeping observer missions and seventeen peace missions \n     currently active around the world, made up of 80,000 people, \n     the most there has ever been.''\n       The ambassador spoke of his concern in conveying to the \n     general public the importance of the U.N.'s peace-keeping \n     accomplishments--in Kashmir, the Congo, Cyprus. He recalled a \n     ``wonderful'' response of Boutros Boutros-Ghali to a question \n     on Cyprus: ``Whatever it has cost [in terms of peace \n     keeping], it's a great deal cheaper than if Turkey and Cyprus \n     and Greece had gone to war.''\n       ``There are certainly problems--in Somalia and Bosnia,'' \n     the ambassador said. ``Yugoslavia is a nightmare, but you \n     have to view the tough points, tough years, tough arenas and \n     tough skirmishes along with the successes. Golan Heights, El \n     Salvador were great successes.''\n       The U.N.'s peace-keeping budget is an indication of both \n     the magnitude of the problem and the efforts to solve \n     conflicts. Two years ago, he pointed out, the budget was $280 \n     million. This year it is $3.5 billion.\n       In an interesting aside, the Greenwich resident also noted \n     that eighty percent of the media's coverage of the work of \n     the United Nations is on peace-keeping forces and only twenty \n     percent on its efforts in economic and social development. \n     ``One could argue slightly on the percentage points, but I \n     will say categorically that twenty percent of the work of the \n     U.N. is peace keeping and eighty percent, economic and social \n     development. I think the world's views are guided by CNN.''\n       In recognition of its accomplishments, the United Nations \n     Peace-keeping Force was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in \n     1988, joining the ranks of other Nobel Prize winners: the \n     Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees; \n     the United Nations Children's Fund; and U.N. individuals \n     Ralph Bunche, Lester Pearson, Dag Hammerskjold and others.\n       September 1960.--Seventeen newly independent states, \n     sixteen of them African, join the United Nations, the biggest \n     increase in membership in any one year.\n       ``The key number one success of the U.N. has been as the \n     midwife of history.'' Ambassador Reed said.\n       ``Take Africa as an example, Ethiopia, South Africa, \n     Liberia and Egypt (included on the continent) signed the \n     original charter in 1945--only four African countries--and \n     now we have fifty-one member nations from Africa. That's an \n     amazing statement right there! The independence! The bursting \n     of sovereign states!''\n       October 12, 1960.--Khrushchev bangs shoe on desk--media \n     reaction ecstatic. As proof positive, Ambassador Reed pointed \n     out that a photograph of that occasion is one of the most \n     sought-after pictures in the world, and almost impossible to \n     get.\n       Truculence was Khrushchev's style, which proved to be more \n     atmosphere than substantive. Most people recall the incident \n     as the behavior of a reckless peasant in an establishment \n     priding itself on restraint and decorum.\n       Ambassador Reed considers it an unfortunate reaction \n     flashed around the world, one that makes for good anecdotes \n     in a course on public diplomacy. ``From a protocolary \n     point of view, I think the world was aghast.''\n       October 25, 1971.--General Assembly seats representatives \n     of the People's Republic of China.\n       ``The Republic of China, commonly known as Taiwan, was \n     voted out of the General Assembly and replaced by the \n     People's Republic of China (mainland China). This was a major \n     event for the United Nations and a turning point for the \n     world organization. I do remember as a young international \n     banker saying over and over again that some formula has to be \n     worked out here to recognize this behemoth.''\n       April 27, 1994.--Apartheid ends in South Africa. U.N. \n     monitors peaceful elections.\n       Two world maps hanging in the hall at the United Nations \n     graphically illustrate how the United Nations has enabled \n     people in over forty-five countries to participate in free \n     and fair elections. It has provided electoral advice, \n     assistance and monitoring of results.\n       December 15, 1994.--The island of Palau, in the Pacific \n     Ocean, is the latest member nation to be admitted. Once a \n     colony of Japan, it is the last of U.N. territories to \n     achieve independence.\n       ``Today, less than two million people live under colonial \n     rule,'' the ambassador said. ``Decolonization has got to have \n     been the high mark of the world organization. I maintain it \n     is the mark of success--there has been an explosion from \n     fifty-one members to one hundred and eighty-five. The very \n     first step an infant nation takes to achieve sovereignty is \n     to apply for membership in the United Nations.''\n       Ambassador Joseph Verner Reed understands public diplomacy. \n     His world is a world of protocol and motorcades, \n     representing, as he does, Boutros Boutros-Ghali at state \n     funerals, inauguration ceremonies and commonwealth \n     conferences.\n       Being a participant in the ``House''--whether it be in the \n     ``super dome of the world diplomacy'' as he refers to the \n     General Assembly Hall, or striding its corridors with fleet-\n     foot compassion--enables him to foster harmony through \n     understanding. He believes this is the principal mission of \n     the United Nations. And he points to the number of treaties \n     that have effectively prevented the spread of nuclear weapons \n     around the world.\n       The circular study in his home at Denbigh Farm reflects a \n     career peppered with pomp and majesty. Numerous pictures of \n     him with \n\n[[Page S 17335]]\n     world dignitaries cover the wall. He was in this manor born and he has \n     furnished the room with a needlepoint carpet made by his \n     mother; bronze American eagles; flags from the U.S. services; \n     ``and that one over there is George Washington's flag, isn't \n     that great?'' There are boxes of memorabilia and copies of \n     speeches and letters--a note from Barbara Bush. ``Know you \n     were a large part of the happy times''; a plaque of wood that \n     President Truman stood on at the dedication of the United \n     Nations and on which he later wrote, ``It was quite a day! \n     Harry S. Truman.''\n       The continued financial support of member countries is of \n     great concern to Ambassador Joseph Verner Reed. He terms the \n     situation ``donor fatigue'' and views the new Republican \n     Congress's push to lower contributions from the United States \n     to the regular U.N. budget as a cause for alarm.\n       Yet he is confident and tireless in his dedication to \n     seeing to it that the job is well done. The job at hand right \n     now is the golden jubilee and its theme is particularly \n     poignant: ``We the people--United for a better world.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/11/17/senate-section/article/S17333-2", "month": "11", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "17", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S17335]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       TRIBUTE TO JAMES ROTHSTEIN\n\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Mr. President, today I pay tribute to a great South \nDakotan--James Rothstein. I was saddened to receive word that James \npassed away recently. He was my friend, and I will miss him.\n  James spent his life in the Midwest. Though born in Eden Valley, MN, \nand a high school student in Haynes, ND, James Rothstein spent most of \nhis life in Mobridge, SD. He played a vital role in his community, \nwhere he served on many local and State boards. He dedicated his life \nto the development of his State and community. Indeed, James Rothstein \nwas a leader who cared deeply about the people of South Dakota.\n  For years, James served in the South Dakota House of Representatives. \nHe was a vocal member of the South Dakota legislature. In fact, he \nserved as majority leader of the State House from 1969 until 1973.\n  James worked hard all his life. He devoted his time to building the \neconomy in Mobridge. He helped the city grow, develop, and prosper. I \nam privileged to have known James. His leadership, good will, and \nservice have inspired me in my own life. He will be missed.\n  Mr. President, the Sioux Falls, SD, Argus Leader newspaper recently \nprinted an article praising James Rothstein's life-long \naccomplishments. I ask unanimous consent that the article be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n        [From the Sioux Falls, SD, Argus Leader, Nov. 11, 1995]\n\n     James Rothstein Dies at 81; From Politics to Sales, He Fit in\n\n                         (By Denise D. Tucker)\n\n       Mobridge--James Leland Rothstein maintained relationships \n     with people from all walks of life. Rubbing elbows with \n     farmers or governors, he fit in.\n       ``He was a distinguished gentleman,'' said Rothstein's son, \n     John of Mobridge.\n       Rothstein, 81, died Tuesday, Nov. 14, 1995, at the Mobridge \n     Regional Hospital.\n       Rothstein, described by his son as a humble man, enjoyed \n     being with people.\n       ``He was in the insurance business and he liked it because \n     it put him in front of lots and lots of people,'' said John \n     Rothstein.\n       Through his volunteer efforts, Rothstein was able to help \n     and influence a number of lives. He volunteered for civic \n     organizations and served in political office.\n       He was a member, past president and director of the \n     Mobridge Chamber of Commerce; was past president and director \n     of the Mobridge Community Hospital Association; was the \n     cochairman of the Mobridge Community Hospital fund drive; was \n     past president and board member of the Mobridge School \n     district; chairman of the Walworth County School Board; past \n     president, director and member of the Mobridge Rotary Club; \n     founding member, past secretary and director of the Mobridge \n     Rodeo Association; fund drive chairman for the Boy Scouts; \n     chairman of the Walworth County Cancer Society; member of the \n     Oahe Sportsman Club; past president and director of the \n     Mobridge Country Club; and the Walworth County director for \n     Radio Free Europe.\n       ``He had a huge capacity for taking on chores,'' said \n     Rothstein's son. ``He was a multidimensional person.''\n       Rothstein's political contributions included serving in the \n     state Legislature from 1963 until 1974. He was voted \n     outstanding freshman legislator in 1965. He served on various \n     committees and was majority leader from 1969 to 1973 in the \n     House of Representatives. He also served on the \n     Transportation Department board from 1979 until 1992. He was \n     inducted into the South Dakota Transportation Hall of Fame in \n     1993.\n       John Rothstein said his father decided young age that he \n     wanted to do something that would make him a distinguished \n     man. He was able to do so through his contributions.\n       Rothstein was born April 10, 1914, at Eden Valley, Minn. He \n     moved with his family to Haynes N.D., and graduated from \n     Haynes High School. He later moved to Bismarck, N.D., where \n     he was employed by Liggett & Myers Tobacco Co. as a salesman. \n     In 1936, he moved to Aberdeen, where he was employed by \n     Griggs-Cooper Co. as a salesman.\n       He married Lucille Adkins on July 20, 1938, in Aberdeen. \n     They made their home there. In June 1940 he was transferred \n     to Mobridge. In 1943, he resigned from the Griggs-Cooper Co. \n     and began a career in insurance.\n       From April 26, 1944, until Dec. 10, 1945, he served in the \n     U.S. Navy, during World War II. After his discharge, he began \n     his association with Provident Life which lasted more than 50 \n     years.\n       He was a member of St. Joseph's Catholic Church, Knights of \n     Columbus, VFW and the Parker-Browder American Legion Post of \n     Mobridge.\n       He was also a member of the Life Underwriters of South \n     Dakota, Aberdeen Association and has received the National \n     Quality Award for more than 35 years.

Mr. President, I am pleased to cosponsor S. 1043, the \nNatural Disaster Insurance and Protection Act.\n  Our country's present method of addressing natural disasters makes no \nsense. Natural disaster relief has cost taxpayers $45 billion over the \npast 6 years. Too much of our Federal efforts are spent on dealing with \ndamage after it has occurred rather than undertaking mitigation efforts \nto prevent as much damage as we can. The only way to reduce the total \nsocial cost of natural disasters is mitigation undertaken before \nnatural disasters occur. The Natural Disaster Insurance and Protection \nAct is designed to foster these mitigation efforts.\n  Presently, when a natural disaster occurs, relief efforts often are a \npolitical game: especially when the disaster impacts populous, \npolitically important States. In addition, some areas of the country \nare particularly prone to natural disasters. Taxpayers from the rest of \nthe country end up subsidizing residents of those disaster-prone areas \nthrough ever-increasing disaster relief payments. This subsidy must be \nreduced. Taxpayers simply should not be asked to continue to bear such \nhigh relief costs.\n  The need for natural disaster relief funds can be reduced if \nindividuals in disaster prone areas are properly insured. S. 1043 seeks \nto establish a mechanism to assure both that insurance is available in \ndisaster-prone areas and to encourage individuals to purchase that \ninsurance.\n  The Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation, which I \nchair, has already held one hearing on this bill. At that hearing some \nraised concerns about the insurance entity the bill establishes. This \nis a complex and important bill. It will be further examined by \nCommerce Committee. As that examination proceeds, we need to make \ncertain the insurance entity functions as intended. The insurance \nentity established should place private capital at risk and use market-\nbased methods to achieve appropriate pricing of the insurance offered. \nFurthermore, that insurance entity should not need, or in any way \nobligate, the infusion of Federal funds to maintain solvency.\n  This bill attempts to put our policy on better footing. The Commerce \nCommittee will continue its work on this legislation and it is my hope \nwe can address the concerns raised and pass a bill that will establish \na program to help victims of disaster recover while limiting the \nexposure of other taxpayers to pay for a Federal bailout every time \ndisaster strikes.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/11/17/senate-section/article/S17335-2", "month": "11", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "17", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S17335-S17336]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 3:47 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Ms. Goetz, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House \nagrees to the report of the committee of conference on the disagreeing \nvotes of the two Houses on the amendments of the Senate to the bill \n(H.R. 2491) to provide for reconciliation pursuant to section 105 of \nthe concurrent resolution on the budget for fiscal year 1996.\n\n[[Page S 17336]]\n\n\n                   EXECUTIVE AND OTHER COMMUNICATIONS\n\n  The following communications were laid before the Senate, together \nwith accompanying papers, reports, and documents, which were referred \nas indicated:\n\n       EC-1600.

Mr. President, today I am introducing the Prisoner \nFraud Prevention Act. This legislation would crack down on prisoners \nwho continue to commit crime from behind bars by cheating American \ntaxpayers and our welfare system. Recently the Senate passed H.R. 4, \ncomprehensive welfare reform legislation. This bill would go a long way \ntoward reducing fraud and abuse in the Supplemental Security Income \n(SSI) program. The legislation I am introducing today would take our \nanti-fraud efforts one step further.\n  Under current law, it is illegal for prisoners to receive SSI \npayments while incarcerated. To carry out this mandate, the Social \nSecurity Administration enters into agreements with federal and state \nprisons to collect the names of inmates. However, these agreements do \nnot completely prevent inmates from fraudulently receiving benefits, \nbecause about one-third of prisoners in the U.S. are held in county \n\n[[Page S 17337]]\njails. Unbeknownst to the Social Security Administration, these local \nprisoners often continue to receive SSI payments.\n  The legislation I am introducing today would offer local sheriffs an \nincentive to work with the Social Security Administration to stop \npayment of these fraudulent benefits. The bill would reward sheriffs \nwho voluntarily turn inmate lists over to the Social Security \nAdministration by allowing them to keep one-half of the value of the \nfirst checks that are intercepted. This would speed up the process of \nremoving prisoners from SSI rolls as well as catch those prisoners who \nslipped through the system. This is a money saver for American \ntaxpayers. In fact, the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimated \nthat this proposal would save $127 million over five years.\n  Additionally, this legislation would bar anyone who received SSI \nfraudulently while in prison from receiving benefits for the next ten \nyears.\n  By allowing sheriffs to collect a ``bounty'', we can do a number of \npositive things: we can provide some seed money for local law \nenforcement and help put an end to the abuse for which the SSI program \nunfortunately has become famous. This type of abuse is an insult both \nto hard-working taxpayers who struggle daily without government \nassistance as well as families on assistance who play by the rules. \nCongress must take a no-tolerance stance toward fraud and abuse of \npublic assistance. This bill establishes the get-tough approach we \nneed.\n  I am pleased that the National Sheriffs Association has endorsed this \nlegislation. I hope my colleagues will join me in sponsoring it.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n       There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be \n     printed in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1418\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to impose sanctions against Nigeria; to the Committee \non Foreign Relations.\n\n\n                       THE NIGERIA DEMOCRACY ACT\n\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation \non behalf of myself, Senators Leahy, Feingold, and others, imposing \nsanctions against the Government of Nigeria.\n  Before I explain a bit about this legislation, let me just say I very \nmuch appreciate being able to introduce it at this point, because I \nknow we are anxious to begin the debate on the Balanced Budget Act of \n1995, a very important piece of legislation, but there has been a \ntragic occurrence and an escalation of events in Nigeria which I think \nneeds to be addressed.\n  Last week, the Nigerian military regime, led by General Sani Abacha, \nexecuted nine Nigerian political activists, including Ken Saro-Wiwa, \nfollowing a seriously flawed judicial proceeding. This action, in the \nface of international pleas for clemency, is the latest in a series of \nvery tragic, tragic, outrageous actions by the Nigerian military \ngovernment.\n  Until this last atrocity, the international community had engaged in \na policy of limited sanctions and diplomatic engagement. In Congress, \nwe sent letters expressing our concern. We engaged the Nigerian \nAmbassador. We held hearings. But the situation has reached the point \nwhere we simply must respond in a forceful and clear manner.\n  Nigeria is a country heading for collapse, Mr. President. Its \neconomic system has deteriorated dramatically. Political repression \ncontinues to grow. Ethnic tensions have increased.\n  General Abacha and Nigerian military leadership must understand that \ntheir isolation will only increase unless they move toward respecting \nhuman rights and a civilian democratic government.\n  Nigeria is a country that has enormous potential, enormous resources \nto call upon, and it can only be a real tragedy for the African \nContinent and the rest of the world to see this collapse into such a \nvery tragic situation.\n  The legislation that we are introducing today imposes a series of \nsanctions against the Nigerian Government. It codifies the number of \nsanctions already imposed by the administration, including a ban on \nforeign aid, military sales and export financing; a termination of air \nflights between Nigeria and the United States; an end to U.S. support \nfor Nigeria at the World Bank, IMF and other international financial \ninstitutions; and a visa ban on any Nigerian who formulates, implements \nor benefits from policies which hinder Nigeria's transition to \ndemocracy.\n  The legislation also imposes several new tough sanctions. It bans all \nnew United States investment in Nigeria, including in the energy \nsector. While some may argue that this step may hurt U.S. businesses, \nthere can be no doubt that the Nigerian regime profits from American \ninvestment. Several large projects under consideration personally \nbenefit the top Nigerian leadership.\n\n  It also freezes the personal assets of the top officials of the \nNigerian regime. If these leaders pull the country into a downward \nspiral of repression and economic decline, there will be a personal \ncost to them.\n  It expresses a sense of Congress that the international community \nshould consider suspending Nigeria from international sports \ncompetitions. South Africa recently expelled Nigeria from a soccer \ntournament. We should consider following their example in other fora.\n  In addition, recognizing the importance of multilateral action, the \nlegislation urges the President to build international support for \nother actions, including a U.N. arms embargo, a multilateral oil \nembargo and a U.N. Human Rights Commission condemnation.\n  It is critical that the United States work closely with other members \nof the international community, particularly Great Britain and South \nAfrica, in this effort to promote democratic change in Nigeria.\n  Finally, the legislation makes clear our intent to pursue even \ntougher sanctions if the Nigerian regime continues its brutal and \nlawless ways. \n\n[[Page S 17338]]\n\n  I am one who believes we must be very cautious in applying sanctions \nagainst foreign governments, but I believe the situation in Nigeria has \nreached the point where we must send an unambiguous and tough signal to \nGeneral Abacha. We will not stand by idle as he drags his country into \nchaos. If General Abacha would move toward respecting human rights and \ninstituting a new civilian regime, the sanctions would be lifted and we \nwould welcome Nigeria back as a partner and friend in the international \ncommunity. If he continues to move in the wrong direction, the \nisolation will grow and the economic price will be high.\n  Mr. President, I know that Senator Leahy has long been interested and \nconcerned about this situation, as has Senator Feingold. I welcome the \nopportunity to have them speak to this issue as well. I yield the \nfloor, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Kansas. I note \nthat this is introduced on behalf of her, myself and cosponsored by the \nSenator from Wisconsin, Mr. Feingold. I ask unanimous consent that when \nit is introduced, also added after us as a cosponsor be the Senator \nfrom Minnesota, Mr. Wellstone.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am proud to join with Senator Kassebaum \non this. I am sad that it is necessary that we do this. Last week, \npeople around the world were horrified to learn that Ken Saro-Wiwa, who \nwas a respected Nigerian writer, a human rights activist, known not \nonly throughout Nigeria but around the world, was executed, along with \nothers, after a flagrantly unfair trial by a military court.\n  The legislation we introduce today is a tribute to Mr. Saro-Wiwa and \nto other Nigerians who have given their lives--and there are others--or \nlanguish in prison because of the pursuit of democracy and a better \nlife for the Nigerian people.\n  On November 10, Mr. Saro-Wiwa, who was a member of the Ogoni Tribe \nwho live in poverty in the rich, oil-producing delta region of southern \nNigeria, was hanged with eight of his colleagues. They had been accused \nof inciting the murder of four other Ogoni leaders.\n  Ken Saro-Wiwa and his colleagues were the latest casualties of one of \nthe most brutal military regimes in the world. Gen. Sani Abacha, who \nseized power in a 1993 coup, has mimicked the tyrannical rule of his \nAfrican neighbor, President Mobutu of Zaire, who plundered his country \nand killed or imprisoned anyone who dared to oppose him.\n  President Mobutu will go down as one of the great tyrants of this \ncentury, one of the greatest robbers of this century, and General \nAbacha seems to be trying to catch up.\n  Like Mobutu, General Abacha has become a multimillionaire, while \nNigeria, a country with enormous human and economic potential, the most \npopulous country in sub-Saharan Africa, has been brutalized and \nimpoverished. Saro-Wiwa's execution is part of a countrywide repression \nof utter brutality, marked by arbitrary arrests, detention without \ntrial, kangaroo courts when trials do take place, and prisons so \nappalling that death might be preferable.\n  Despite claims that he is leading Nigeria to democracy and civilian \ngovernment, there is absolutely no reason to believe that General \nAbacha will ever willingly give up power. His hands are too bloody to \nrisk the restoration of the rule of law in Nigeria.\n  Today in Ogoniland, armed troops encircle the cemetery where Saro-\nWiwa is buried to prevent access by the public, and anyone caught with \na photograph of him is arrested. The Washington Post reports today that \nthere may be even more executions in the coming days.\n  Mr. President, along with others, I sought clemency for Ken Saro-Wiwa \nfor more than 1 year. I wrote to the Nigerian Foreign Minister, the \nNigerian Ambassador, the Secretary of State, and have even appealed to \nother African leaders on his behalf. All to no avail. While I was not \nprivy to the evidence against Mr. Saro-Wiwa, I believed strongly, like \nso many others, that the Nigerian Government should have either \nreleased him or tried him in a civil court in accordance with due \nprocess.\n  There is no doubt that General Abacha wanted to silence Ken Saro-\nWiwa. He had led a popular campaign against the oil companies that have \nravaged and poisoned the land of his people. Oil accounts for 90 \npercent of Nigeria's export earnings, and whoever controls it controls \nthe country's wealth, and controls the Nigerian Army. General Abacha \napparently decided that he was better off with Saro-Wiwa dead, rather \nthan as a continuing champion of Ogoni resistance. He probably figured \nthat the rest of the world would forget him.\n  The world will not soon forget Ken Saro-Wiwa. He was a champion of \nthe rights of his people, and a world leader in the struggle to protect \nthe environment. While our efforts to save his life ultimately failed, \nhis memory inspires us to support the cause for which he and others \ngave their lives.\n  This bill aims to support and strenthen the measures already taken by \nthe administration, both before and since Mr. Saro-Wiwa's execution. In \naddition, it prohibits new United States investment in Nigeria, \nincluding investment in a liquefied natural gas project that the \nInternational Finance Corporation has refused to finance, and which \nGeneral Abacha reportedly has a personal interest in.\n  It also freezes the assets of Nigerians who are responsible for or \nbenefit from policies which hinder Nigeria's transition to democracy. \nThe Nigerian Government should think long and hard before it retaliates \nagainst American assets in Nigeria, because there is far more that we \ncan do.\n  Of particular importance, the legislation calls on the President to \nactively seek multilateral support for these sanctions in the United \nNations. We are already hearing of similar steps by the European \ncommunity, but frankly the response of the international community has \nbeen shamefully timid. The United States has even run into resistance \nat the United Nations to a resolution condemning Nigeria for executing \nSaro-Wiwa. And Shell Oil, which derives a seventh of its global \nproduction of oil from Nigeria, seems to care about nothing but its own \nprofits.\n  These and other sanctions are modeled on the sanctions we imposed \nagainst South Africa in the 1980's. They may be waived by the President \nif the Nigerian Government releases political prisoners, and \ndemonstrates a commitment to human rights and an unequivocal commitment \nto democratic government.\n  We also provide a waiver if the President determines it is important \nto the national interest. This was included, in part, to encourage the \nNigerian Government to increase its cooperation in counternarcotics. \nNigeria is a center of drug trafficking and money laundering, and the \nUnited States has a strong interest in obtaining the Nigerian \nGovernment's cooperation to curtail it.\n  But the real trigger in this legislation is General Abacha himself. \nIf he continues to imprison and murder his political opponents, the \nsanctions will get even stronger. We will consider everything including \nan oil embargo. Nigeria will become even further isolated, and General \nAbacha will eventually go the way of other African tyrants--forced from \npower and either shot or imprisoned, or sent into exile overturned in a \ncoup. If, on the other hand, he decides to respect the rights of his \npeople, the sanctions will end.\n  I am not so naive to believe that General Abacha will comply with the \nconditions in this legislation. His decision to execute Ken Saro-Wiwa \nwas a sign that he would rather be branded an international pariah, \nthan save his country from ruin. But the choice is his.\n  Mr. President, I also want to mention the oil companies who were the \nfocus of Ken Saro-Wiwa's campaign. Had it not been for the \nenvironmental damage they have caused in Ogoniland, I suspect Ken Saro-\nWiwa would be alive today.\n  We have not included sanctions against the oil companies in this \nlegislation, but we expressly reserve the right to do so if the \nsituation does not improve in Nigeria. Only 10 percent of our oil comes \nfrom Nigeria, but that 10 percent comprises 40 percent of Nigeria's \ntotal oil exports.\n  I strongly urge those companies, whether they are American companies \n\n[[Page S 17339]]\n  or foreign companies, to reconsider their activities in Nigeria. They \nare responsible for propping up an extraordinarily brutal and corrupt \nregime, and for destroying the livelihoods of many of the poorest \npeople in Nigeria, the people who Ken Saro-Wiwa gave his life for. \nPrivate business has a responsibility to the betterment of society, not \nonly to accruing profits. If there ever were a place to apply that \nprinciple it is in Nigeria today.\n  Mr. President, we cannot bring Ken Saro-Wiwa back to life, but as he \nsaid before he was executed, his words will live on. This legislation \naims to carry on the campaign he gave his life for.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that an article in today's New \nYork Times on the recent arrest of nine Nigerian human rights \nactivists, be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the New York Times, Nov. 17, 1995]\n\n    Rights Group Says Nigeria Seized 9 to Thwart Protest of Hangings\n\n       Lagos, Nigeria, November 16.--A Nigerian human rights \n     organization said today that nine of its members had been \n     arrested because the military Government feared they were \n     about to protest publicly against the execution of nine \n     Government critics last week.\n       Jiti Ogunye, secretary general of the Committee for the \n     Defense of Human Rights, said two student union leaders in \n     the university in Benin were arrested on Wednesday and the \n     other members of the group were arrested here last week. \n     ``All of them are detained in the Lagos police headquarters \n     but we have been denied access to them,'' he said.\n       There was no official confirmation of the arrests.\n       Nigeria's military rulers provoked international outrage on \n     Friday after the hanging of Ken Saro-Wiwa, a prominent \n     Nigerian author, and eight other campaigners for minority \n     rights. They were sentenced by a tribunal for the murder of \n     four pro-Government chiefs in the oil-rich Ogoniland region. \n     They had been campaigning for compensation for the Ogoni \n     tribe in the southeast for oil produced there for decades by \n     multinational corporations, principally the Anglo-Dutch oil \n     giant Shell.\n       Gen. Sani Abacha, Nigeria's ruler, in his first reaction to \n     the international furor over the hanging of the rights \n     activists, accused foreign powers of interference, local \n     newspapers reported.\n       Several nations have recalled their ambassadors to protest \n     the executions, Nigeria has recalled its own envoys in \n     retaliation.\n       The United States and Britain--Nigeria's former colonial \n     ruler--imposed an arms embargo on Lagos and the European \n     Union froze development aid.\n       In Strasbourg today, the European Parliament urged the \n     European Union to impose an oil embargo on Nigeria, but a \n     European Union diplomat in Brussels said an effective embargo \n     could only be carried out through the United Nations Security \n     Council, ``and I don't think the votes are there.''\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin is recognized.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I am proud to join with my colleagues in \nintroducing the Nigeria Democracy Act. I appreciate the statements of \nthe Senator from Kansas and the Senator from Vermont. This tough \nsanctions measure comes on the heels of the chilling execution of 9 \nhuman rights activists, including renowned playwright Mr. Ken Saro \nWiwa, in Nigeria on Friday, and at a time when the regime of General \nSani Abacha has intensified its crackdown against its own people.\n\n  The bill we are introducing today is intended to ratchet up the \npressure on this brutal military regime, and improve the protection of \nbasic human rights in Nigeria and indeed the whole region. Let this \nmeasure be a warning that if the human rights situation deteriorates--\nthat is, if any more political prisoners are executed, or more decrees \nviolating basic human rights are enacted--the United States will \nrespond with yet harsher measures, and will actively seek multilateral \nsupport from our friends and allies. The reported arrest of 9 more \nhuman rights activists peacefully protesting last week's executions is \nnot a good sign.\n  Mr. President, Nigeria has the potential to become a major world \ntrading partner, and an influential member of the international \ncommunity. Yet General Abacha is squandering his country with rampant \ncorruption; brutal policies of repression and execution; and severe \neconomic mismanagement.\n  Some observers will say that General Abacha is simply trying to \nmaintain the integrity of Nigeria while the country adjusts to a \ndrastic political change. I am wholly unconvinced, however, that the \nmurder, assault, and suppression that Abacha has engaged in will hold \nthe country together; in fact, I believe that as a consequence of the \nrepression, Nigeria is more likely to break out in civil war.\n  Mr. President, I applaud the steps the administration has taken thus \nfar on Nigeria. But I think we should take an even tougher stand with \nGeneral Abacha at this point. Engagement has not worked, as witnessed \nin last Friday's executions. International pleas to commute the death \nsentences and to re-try the defendants were ignored. Faxes and phone \ncalls from several of us introducing this bill today to Nigerian \nofficials were never returned. I am not persuaded that engagement and \ndialog with Abacha has been terribly effective.\n  The Nigeria Democracy Act will codify the sanctions already ordered \nby the President, and would impose further sanctions on Nigeria as \nwell. Many of the measures suggested in this bill come from the \nComprehensive Anti-Apartheid Act, which was quite successful in helping \nto secure democratic transition in South Africa. In fact, it was \nNigeria, ironically, that led the world in sanctioning South Africa for \nits human rights abuses under apartheid.\n  As the Chair has indicated, one of the toughest measures in this bill \nis a prohibition on new investment in Nigeria, including banning United \nStates firms from investing in Shell Oil's ill-timed, $3.8 \nbillion project in Bonny, Nigeria, which was reported yesterday.\n\n  While I believe there are moral and strategic benefits in the United \nStates acting unilaterally, of course, it would be better and I would \nprefer to see these sanctions to be applied multilaterally. Thus, our \nbill also directs the President to urge actively other countries to \njoin our sanctions effort in order to promote human rights and \ndemocracy in Nigeria.\n  Mr. President, as the Senator from Vermont suggests, perhaps we \nshould also take a look at an oil embargo, either unilateral or \nmultilateral, at this time.\n  Since over 90 percent of Nigeria's foreign exchange income comes from \nits oil industry--and since Abacha personally benefits from most of \nthese sales through corruption--it makes sense that an oil embargo \nwould hit the regime hard. I am also deeply disappointed in how Shell \nOil has conducted itself in the midst of this turmoil. However, there \nare other considerations to look at seriously as well, and over the \nnext few weeks I will be carefully considering the intricacies and \ncomplexities of such an oil embargo proposal.\n  For the moment, though, let me conclude by saying I believe the bill \nwe are introducing takes a responsible approach in urging the President \nto build support for a multilateral oil embargo. Grassroots support for \nsuch an initiative seems to be growing. South African President Nelson \nMandela, who before the executions was advocating diplomatic engagement \nwith the Nigerians, came out yesterday in support of an oil embargo \nagainst the Abacha regime. If the situation deteriorates, we must \nprepare for such an action.\n  Let me congratulate the Chair of the subcommittee, Senator Kassebaum, \non her initiative. I look forward to working with my colleagues on this \nbill in the coming months.\n  Our bill will not bring back Ken Saro-Wiwa and the other executed \nactivists. But perhaps it will help create an environment in which \noppression and brutality like that already exhibited will no longer be \ntolerated.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I ask unanimous consent that Senator McCain and Senator \nPell be added as cosponsors.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  By Mr. STEVENS (for himself, Mr. Breaux, Mr. Chafee, Mr. Johnston, \nand Mr. Murkowski):\n  S. 1420. A bill to amend the Marine Mammal Protection Act of 1972 to \nsupport International Dolphin Conservation Program in the eastern \ntropical Pacific Ocean,and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nCommerce, Science, and Transportation.\n\n\n           THE INTERNATIONAL DOLPHIN CONSERVATION program ACT\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation to \nallow for the domestic implementation of an international agreement \nrelating to \n\n[[Page S 17340]]\nthe protection of dolphins and harvest of tuna in the eastern tropical \nPacific Ocean (ETP).\n  Senators Breaux, Chafee, Johnston, and Murkowski join me as original \ncosponsors of this legislation.\n  On October 4, 1995, twelve nations agreed in the ``Declaration of \nPanama'' in Panama City, Panama, to seek to create a legally binding \ninstrument to reduce dolphin mortality in the ETP.\n  The instrument is to be based on the La Jolla Agreement, a \nmultilateral nonbinding agreement adopted in 1992, which included \nannual and per-vessel limits on dolphin mortality and observer coverage \nstandards for tuna vessels. It will be called the ``International \nDolphin Conservation Program'' (IDCP).\n  In addition to strengthening the La Jolla provisions and continuing \nthe La Jolla goal of reducing and eventually eliminating dolphin \nmortality in the ETP, this new binding agreement will: first, improve \nconservation and management measures for tuna stocks and other living \nmarine resources in the ETP; second, reduce the bycatch of juvenile \nyellowfin tuna and nontarget species; and third, establish a system of \nincentives to vessel captains to continue to reduce dolphin mortality.\n  Under existing U.S. law (16 U.S.C. 307(a)), tuna that is caught using \na purse seine net intentionally deployed on or to encircle dolphin \ncannot be labeled as ``dolphin safe'' and is prohibited (since June 1, \n1994) from being sold in the United States.\n  The successful adoption of the binding agreement envisioned in the \nDeclaration of Panama is contingent upon a change in U.S. law to allow \n``dolphin safe'' to mean tuna that is caught by a vessel in a set in \nwhich no dolphin mortality occurred. This would mean that tuna caught \nin a purse seine net intentionally deployed to encircle dolphins could \nbe labeled as ``dolphin safe'' and imported into the United States, as \nlong as no dolphin mortality occurred during the set.\n  The legislation we are introducing today would make this change to \nthe Marine Mammal Protection Act (MMPA). Since the passage of the MMPA \nin 1972, dolphin mortality in the ETP has been reduced from over \n400,000 per year, to below 5,000 in 1994.\n  The countries that have continued to fish for tuna by encircling \ndolphins have shown that it can be done without killing dolphins.\n  We've learned from our own fishermen that alternative methods, such \nas setting on logs, can result in substantial bycatch of nontarget \nspecies and juvenile tuna.\n  The IDCP would make binding an ETP mortality limit of 5,000 dolphins \nand allow encirclement to continue, but would maintain the goal of \neliminating dolphin mortality altogether in the ETP. The IDCP would, \nfor the first time, provide international species-specific mortality \nlimits that will help guarantee the recovery of individual dolphin \nspecies. The IDCP and legislation we are proposing today will give U.S. \nconsumers a guarantee that no dolphin mortality occurred when the tuna \nthey bought was caught.\n  It will allow U.S. fishermen to encircle dolphins in the course of \ntuna fishing, but require them to comply with the dolphin mortality \ncaps and provisions of the IDCP to reduce mortality, and will prohibit \nthem from selling tuna in the United States if dolphin were killed when \nthe tuna was caught.\n  Specifically, the bill we are proposing would implement the IDCP \nthrough changes to the MMPA that would: prohibit the importation of \nyellowfin tuna caught with purse seine nets in the ETP unless the tuna \nwas caught by the vessel of a nation participating in, and in \ncompliance with, the IDCP; prohibit tuna caught in the ETP from being \nlabeled as ``dolphin safe'' unless both the captain of the vessel and \nan observer approved under the IDCP have certified that no dolphins \nwere killed during the set in which the tuna was caught; direct the \nSecretary of Commerce to implement regulations for U.S. tuna vessels \nfishing in the ETP under the IDCP, including regulations to require \nobservers on each vessel; give the Secretary of Commerce emergency \nregulatory authority to reduce mortality and injury of dolphins; \nrequire research on (among other things) the effect of the encirclement \non dolphins by purse seine nets; implement a new permitting system, \nwhich includes permit sanctions, to allow U.S. vessels to fish for tuna \nin the ETP; make it unlawful to sell or ship tuna in the United States \nunless it is dolphin safe or has been harvested in compliance with the \nIDCP; and create a general advisory committee and scientific advisory \ncommittee to assist the U.S. section to the IDCP.\n  These changes to the MMPA would take effect once the Secretary of \nState has certified that the legally binding instrument establishing \nthe IDCP has been adopted.\n  This legislation supports the goals of La Jolla Agreement and the \nDeclaration of Panama, and will set a strong example for other nations \nto follow in joining and implementing the IDCP.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1419\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

PURPOSE AND FINDINGS.\n\n       (a) Purpose.--The purpose of this Act is to give effect to \n     the Declaration of Panama, signed October 4, 1995, by the \n     Governments of Belize, Colombia, Costa Rica, Ecuador, France, \n     Honduras, Mexico, Panama, Spain, the United States of \n     America, Vanuatu and Venezuela, including the establishment \n     of the International Dolphin Conservation Program, relating \n     to the protection of dolphins and other species, and the \n     conservation and management of tuna in the eastern tropical \n     Pacific Ocean.\n       (b) Findings.--The Congress finds that twelve nations, \n     including the United States, agreed in the Declaration of \n     Panama to, among other things--\n       (1) require that the total annual dolphin mortality in the \n     purse seine fishery for yellowfish tuna in the eastern \n     tropical Pacific Ocean not exceed 5,000, with the commitment \n     and objective to progressively reduce dolphin mortality to \n     levels approaching zero through the setting of annual limits;\n       (2) establish a per-stock per-year mortality limit up to \n     the year 2001 of between 0.2 percent and 0.1 percent of the \n     minimum population estimate;\n       (3) starting with the year 2001, require that the per-stock \n     per-year mortality of dolphin not exceed 0.1 percent of the \n     minimum population estimate;\n       (4) require that in the event that the mortality limits in \n     paragraphs (1), (2), or (3) are exceeded, all sets on \n     dolphins in the case of paragraph (1), or sets on such stock \n     and any mixed schools containing members of such stock in the \n     case of paragraph (2) or (3), shall cease for that fishing \n     year; in the case of paragraph (2), to conduct a scientific \n     review and assessment in 1998 of progress toward the year \n     2000 objective and consider recommendations as appropriate; \n     and, in the case of paragraph (3), to conduct a scientific \n     review and assessment regarding that stock or those stocks \n     and consider further recommendations;\n       (5) establish a per-vessel maximum annual dolphin mortality \n     limit consistent with the established per-year mortality \n     caps; and\n       (6) provide a system of incentives to vessel captains to \n     continue to reduce dolphin mortality, with the goal of \n     eliminating dolphin mortality.\n\n     SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.\n\n       Section 3 (16 U.S.C. 1362) is amended by adding at the end \n     the following new paragraphs:\n       ``(28) The term `International Dolphin Conservation \n     Program' means the international program established by the \n     agreement signed in La Jolla, California, in June 1992, as \n     formalized, modified, and enhanced in accordance with the \n     Declaration of Panama.\n       ``(29) The term `Declaration of Panama' means the \n     declaration signed in Panama City, Republic of Panama, on \n     October 4, 1995.''.\n\n     SEC. 4.

EFFECTIVE DATE.\n\n       Sections 3 through 6 of this Act shall become effective \n     upon certification by the Secretary of State to Congress that \n     a binding resolution of the Inter-American Tropical Tuna \n     Commission or other legally binding instrument establishing \n     the International Dolphin Conservation Program has been \n     adopted and is in effect.\n\n Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, today, along with Senator Stevens \nand others, I am introducing legislation that will implement the Panama \nDeclaration on the protection of dolphins in the tuna fishery of the \neastern tropical Pacific Ocean. The United States signed the Panama \nDeclaration on October 4, 1995, along with the Governments of Belize, \nColombia, Costa Rica, Ecuador, France, Honduras, Mexico, Panama, Spain, \nVanutatu, and Venezuela. By agreeing to the Panama Declaration, these \ncountries have demonstrated their commitment to the conservation of \necosystems and the sustainable use of living resources related to the \ntuna fishery in the eastern tropical Pacific.\n  By implementing the Panama Declaration, we will strengthen the Inter-\nAmerican Tropical Tuna Commission [IATTC] which has proven to be an \nextremely effective international resource management organization. In \nconjunction with strengthening the IATTC, we will ensure the reduction \nof dolphin mortalities associated with tuna fishing in the eastern \ntropical Pacific Ocean. In addition, we will enable American tuna \nfishermen to re-enter that tuna fishery on the same footing as foreign \nfishermen.\n  Since 1949, the IATTC has served as the regional fishery management \norganization for the tuna fishery of the eastern tropical Pacific \nOcean, managing that fishery in an exemplary manner. One of the fishery \nissues addressed under IATTC auspices is that of dolphin mortality \nassociated with the yellowfin tuna fishery of the eastern tropical \nPacific Ocean. In that fishery, tuna fishermen use dolphins to locate \nschools of mature yellowfin tuna which, for unknown reasons, associate \nwith schools of dolphin. Once the tuna have been located, the fishermen \nuse purse seine nets to encircle schools of dolphin with the objective \nof catching the tuna swimming below the dolphins and then safely \nreleasing the encircled dolphins.\n  In recent years, there has been some concern about these fishing \npractices which, in the past, have resulted in excessive incidental \nmortality to dolphins. In 1992, in an effort to address this problem, \n10 nations with tuna vessels operating in the eastern tropical Pacific \nsigned an agreement known as the La Jolla Agreement. The La Jolla \nAgreement established the International Dolphin Conservation Program, \nor IDCP, which is administered by the IATTC.\n  The regional objective of the IDCP is to reduce dolphin mortalities \nto insignificant levels approaching zero, with a goal of eliminating \nthem entirely. Pursuant to that program, the number of dolphins killed \naccidentally in the tuna fishery has been reduced to less than 4,000 \nannually from a previous average of over 300,000 killed annually. The \ncurrent dolphin mortality represents approximately four one-hundredths \nof one percent of the 9.5 million dolphins of the eastern tropical \nPacific. Thus, the IDCP has been remarkably successful in achieving its \ngoal of reducing unintended dolphin mortalities to biologically \ninsignificant levels approaching zero.\n\n  This legislation will implement the Panama Declaration, formalizing \nthe 1992 La Jolla Agreement and making it a legal agreement binding on \nthe member countries of the IATTC as soon as it is formally adopted. \nThe Panama Declaration strengthens the IDCP and \n\n[[Page S 17344]]\nfurthers its goals by placing a cap of 5,000 per year on dolphin \nmortalities.\n  Although U.S. fishermen developed the techniques now used in \ncapturing tuna and safely releasing dolphins, they effectively have \nbeen foreclosed from fishing in the eastern tropical Pacific since the \n1992 amendments to the Marine Mammal Protection Act, which prohibit the \nencirclement of dolphins. The legislation to implement the Panama \nDeclaration will eliminate the inequitable treatment of United States \ntuna fishermen and enable them to re-enter this important fishery on an \nequal footing with foreign fishermen.\n  The 1992 ban on encirclement of dolphins has required fishermen to \nturn to alternative fishing practices, the use of which causes \nexcessive bycatch of endangered sea turtles, sharks, billfish, and \ngreat numbers of immature tuna and other fish species. This legislation \nwill result in a reduction of this bycatch problem, as well, as it will \npermit fishermen to encircle dolphins as long as they comply with the \nstringent regulations imposed by the IATTC.\n  The purpose of this bill is to improve and solidify efforts to \nprotect dolphins in the eastern tropical Pacific Ocean, as well as to \neliminate the bycatch problems caused by alternative fishing methods. \nThe Panama Declaration establishes a common environmental standard for \nall countries fishing in the region. By formalizing the La Jolla \nAgreement, U.S. and foreign fishermen in the eastern tropical Pacific \nwill be subject to the most stringent fishery regulations in the world. \nThe Panama Declaration represents a tremendous environmental \nachievement, and it enjoys support from such diverse interests as \nenvironmental groups, the U.S. tuna fishing fleet, the Clinton \nadministration, and other countries whose fishermen operate in the \neastern tropical Pacific. I encourage my colleagues to join me in \nsupporting this legislation in order that we may implement this \nimportant international agreement.\n Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I am pleased to join as an original \ncosponsor of legislation introduced by Senators Stevens and Breaux to \nimplement the Panama Declaration. A dozen countries, several major \nenvironmental organizations, the administration, and Senators on both \nsides of the aisle have come together in support of this effort.\n  If we are going to sustain our renewable resources, and particularly \nour marine resources, we need to take a comprehensive ecosystem \napproach toward resource use. After all, management of a single species \ndoes not always produce benefits for the entire ecosystem. It is \nimportant that we seek to reduce bycatch of other marine species, such \nas sharks, sea turtles, and billfish, while we minimize our impact on \ndolphins. That is why this bill is about more than just tuna and \ndolphins. This bill includes changes in current law that will have a \npositive impact on numerous species in the marine environment.\n  The Declaration that this bill would implement will commit the United \nStates and a number of cosignatory nations to conserving the valuable \nmarine life in the eastern Pacific. Moreover, by doing so on a \nmultilateral basis, many of the ongoing international disputes over \ntuna may effectively be resolved. Such strong and sound international \nefforts are therefore welcome.\n  This legislation represents an important opportunity for all parties \ninterested in marine resources to work together toward our common goal: \neffective conservation of dolphin and other marine species in the \neastern Pacific ecosystem. I urge my colleagues to take the time to \nexamine this legislation, and offer comments and suggestions. We have \nthe chance to fashion a long-term solution to the question of marine \nmammal conservation, and it is my hope that this bill will serve as the \nvehicle toward that end.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. MOYNIHAN (for himself and Mr. D'Amato):\n  S. 1422. A bill to authorize the Secretary of the Interior to acquire \nproperty in the town of East Hampton, Suffolk County, NY, for inclusion \nin the Amagansett National Wildlife Refuge, and for other purposes; to \nthe Committee on Environment and Public Works.\n\n\n                    shadmoor acquisition legislation\n\n Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I offer legislation with my \nesteemed colleague Senator D'Amato that would allow the Secretary of \nthe Interior to acquire a parcel of land on Long Island known as \nShadmoor. The land would be added to the Amagansett National Wildlife \nRefuge. Shadmoor supports one of the largest populations of New York \nState's most endangered plant, the sandplain gerardia. The gerardia \nlives in only 12 places in the world, 6 of which are on Long Island.\n  The privately owned land was targeted by the Fish and Wildlife \nService for acquisition in 1991, but no money has been available. \nMeanwhile, the possibility of development on the parcel has increased \ndramatically. New York has received little of the already scarce \nFederal money for the acquisition of land to protect endangered plants. \nThis is clearly an opportunity to begin to rectify that.\n  Shadmoor has other significance. It contains six other rare plants. \nIt has bunkers built during World War II. The dramatic coastline has \n70-foot cliffs eroded by wind and surf. In all, it would be a \ntremendous addition to the Amagansett Refuge.\n  Mr. President, the sandplain gerardia is a part of our natural \nheritage that could easily disappear forever. This is our chance to \npreserve one of its last strongholds. I ask my colleagues to support \nthis authorization.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1422\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. AUTHORITY TO ACQUIRE PROPERTY FOR INCLUSION IN THE \n                   AMAGANSETT NATIONAL WILDLIFE REFUGE.\n\n       (a) Authority To Acquire Property.--The Secretary of the \n     Interior may acquire, for inclusion in the Amagansett \n     National Wildlife Refuge, the area known as the ``Shadmoor \n     Parcel'', consisting of approximately 98 acres (as determined \n     by the Secretary) located along the Atlantic Ocean adjacent \n     to municipal park land in the town of East Hampton, Suffolk \n     County, New York.\n       (b) Management of Acquired Interests.--Land and interests \n     in land acquired by the United States under this section \n     shall be managed by the Secretary of the Interior as part of \n     the Amagansett National Wildlife Refuge.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. GREGG (for himself, Mrs. Kassebaum, Mr. Nunn, Mr. \n        Jeffords, and Mr. Gorton):\n  S. 1423. A bill to amend the Occupational Safety and Health Act of \n1970 to make modifications to certain provisions, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Labor and Human Resources.\n\n\n     the occupational safety and health reform and reinvention act\n\n Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I am pleased to be joined by \nSenators Kassebaum, Nunn, Gorton, and Jeffords in introducing the \nOccupational Safety and Health Reform and Reinvention Act. Let me say \nat the outset that in proposing and considering OSHA reform, worker \nsafety was our first concern. I am firmly committed to ensuring a safe \nand healthy workplace and will not support legislation which puts that \nin jeopardy. I believe in this bill that we have accomplished true OSHA \nreform without compromising the safety of our workers in any way.\n  Throughout my career in public office, I have worked to make \nGovernment more efficient and more user and consumer friendly. Federal \nGovernment agencies have grown so large and become so bureaucratic that \nthey are often not providing the kinds of services and proper oversight \nthat was originally intended when they were created. Too often \nGovernment carries a heavy stick, but no carrot, when it interacts with \nindividual citizens and businesses throughout our country.\n  I believe that it is high time we take a close look at how we can \nimprove the way Government works and, at the same time, provide \nincentives for the private sector to act more responsibly. Americans \nwill be better served in a climate where people in Government, and in \nbusiness, can work together to solve problems in a spirit of \ncooperation, rather than in an atmosphere strictly of threats, \nintimidation, and punitive measures.\n\n[[Page S 17345]]\n\n  When OSHA was enacted, its intended purpose was to make the workplace \nfree from ``recognized hazards that are causing, or likely to cause \ndeath or serious physical harm to . . . employees.'' As is the case \nwith many programs established by Congress over the years, OSHA has \ndeveloped a well-earned reputation for over-regulation. OSHA has moved \nfrom its original purpose of protecting workers to hindering businesses \nwith excessive mandates.\n  While I feel that much of the problem within OSHA is of a cultural \nnature, the bill we are introducing today will concentrate on relieving \nOSHA's oppressive and burdensome regulations, thereby removing a \nfeeling among American employers and employees that OSHA is the ``bad \ncop.'' Our legislation puts in place partnerships for assuring safety \nand health in the workplace.\n  This balanced approach will include a consultation program, voluntary \ncompliance and third-party certification, employee involvement, \nwarnings in lieu of citations for nonserious violations, and reduced \npenalties for nonserious violations. This legislation will use \nincentives, rather than penalties to enhance workplace safety. It will \nallow companies with ``clean'' safety records to implement their own \nhealth and safety programs.\n\n  In closing, I would like to thank Senator Kassebaum on her leadership \nas chairman of the Labor and Human Resources Committee. Without her \ndedication and hard work this legislation would not be possible. I \nwould also like to thank Senator Nunn, Senator Jeffords, and Senator \nGorton. They both have been instrumental in the drafting of this \nimportant legislation. I look forward to working with them and the \nmembers of the Labor Committee on continuing to bring this legislation \nto fruition.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1423\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, I join my colleagues, Senators \nGregg, Nunn, Jeffords, and Gorton, in introducing the Occupational \nSafety and Health Reform and Reinvention Act of 1995. Senator Gregg has \nbeen instrumental in crafting this legislation, which is an important \nstep toward revitalizing a troubled agency.\n  As chairman of the Committee on Labor and Human Resources, I \nfrequently hear that OSHA focuses too much on paperwork and is too \nquick to issue citations in spite of good faith compliance efforts. \nDespite these criticisms, I remain committed to a strong OSHA program \nand will not compromise workplace safety.\n  Mr. President, as committed as I am to this issue, we also must \nrecognize that a great deal has changed since Congress first enacted \nthe Occupational Safety and Health [OSH] Act in 1970. We have learned \nthat although strong enforcement is important, we do not need a one-\nsize-fits-all OSHA enforcement policy. Most employers agree that safety \nmakes good business sense, so we should not treat all employers the \nsame way. We also have watched the Labor Department become preoccupied \nwith paperwork rather than real safety hazards, and that needs to be \nchanged.\n  Mr. President, this OSHA reform bill will refocus OSHA on its primary \nmission, which is to improve the health and safety of American workers. \nIt also requires OSHA to differentiate among employers based on their \ncommitment to workplace safety.\n  The legislation we introduce today provides positive incentives for \nemployers to comply with the law. As a result, OSHA's limited resources \nwill focus on the most dangerous work sites. Rather than offering more \nmandates and punitive sanctions, this bill rewards employers that \nestablish effective health and safety programs or that utilize \ncertified, private sector safety and health professionals by exempting \nthese employers from regular, programmed OSHA inspections.\n  In this way, OSHA may concentrate its efforts on the most dangerous \nworkplaces. OSHA must use its resources efficiently.\n  In addition, the bill reduces penalties for paperwork and other \nnonserious violations. OSHA must concentrate on serious hazards and not \non posting requirements and paperwork.\n  Mr. President, the administration has already endorsed many of the \nreforms in this proposal in their Reinventing Government report. I \napplaud those efforts and will assist the Labor Department as we move \ntoward our common goal of improved safety.\n  Mr. President, this legislation is long overdue, and I urge my \ncolleagues to support it.\n Mr. NUNN. Mr. President, I would like to join my colleagues \nSenators Kassebaum, Gregg, and Gorton in introducing legislation to \nreform the Occupational Safety and Health Administration [OSHA].\n  As my colleagues know, OSHA is one of the most frequently criticized \nagencies in the Federal Government. Recent polls show that OSHA ties \nwith the Internal Revenue Service as the Federal agency which causes \nthe most dissatisfaction among Americans. While everyone agrees that \nGovernment has a responsibility to help ensure safe and healthy \nworkplaces, OSHA's reputation in this area is one of inefficient \nmethods of promoting workplace safety that often alienate businesses \nand workers alike.\n  I understand that some in Congress favor abolishing the agency \nentirely in order to remove the expensive and bureaucratic compliance \nburdens from business. Others favor maintaining the status quo or would \nhave OSHA impose stiffer penalties and more specific requirements on \nbusinesses in order to coerce greater levels of workplace safety. I do \nnot agree with any of these approaches. Instead, I am pleased to join \nmy colleagues in crafting a common-sense approach which addresses past \nproblems and keeps OSHA as a viable agency that is more responsive to \nthe needs of business and more efficient in protecting workers.\n  The bill has two main thrusts. The first is to rebalance the focus of \nOSHA away from solely the ``stick'' method of ensuring compliance which \nconsists of stiff fines and to-the-letter enforcement of rules. \nInstead, we attempt to codify and extend OSHA's ongoing efforts to \nshift toward the ``carrot'' method, which rewards companies making \nsuccessful, good-faith efforts at maintaining and improving safety in \n\n[[Page S 17348]]\nthe workplace. The enforcement authority available to OSHA would still \nremain, however OSHA would be able to utilize other tools to improve \nworkplace safety.\n  The second thrust of the bill is to make OSHA's operations more \nefficient. Studies have shown that many sites of serious workplace \naccidents have not been inspected by federal OSHA inspectors for \nseveral years prior to the accident. The studies showed that this \nproblem is due in part to a shortage of inspectors and a mandate that \nOSHA follow up all complaints, no matter how minor. This proposed \nlegislation would allow OSHA greater flexibility in allocating its \nresources so it can give the most serious workplace problems its \nhighest priority.\n  Mr. President, this bill, like all other legislative proposals, needs \ncareful examination and can be approved.

Mr. President, I hereby submit to the Senate the \nbudget scorekeeping report prepared by the Congressional Budget Office \nunder section 308(b) and in aid of section 311 of the Congressional \nBudget Act of 1974, as amended. This report meets the requirements for \nSenate scorekeeping of section 5 of Senate Concurrent Resolution 32, \nthe first concurrent resolution on the budget for 1986.\n  This report shows the effects of congressional action on the budget \nthrough November 15, 1995. The estimates of budget authority, outlays, \nand revenues, which are consistent with the technical and economic \nassumptions of the 1996 concurrent resolution on the budget (H. Con. \nRes. 67), show that current level spending is below the budget \nresolution by $389.4 billion in budget authority and above the budget \nresolution by $224.8 billion in outlays. Current level is $5.7 billion \nabove the revenue floor in 1996 and $147 billion above the revenue \nfloor over the 5 years 1996-2000. The current estimate of the deficit \nfor purposes of calculating the maximum deficit amount is $20.8 \nbillion, $230.5 billion below the maximum deficit amount for 1996 of \n$251.3 billion.\n  Since my last report, dated November 8, 1995, Congress cleared and \nthe President signed the Perishable Agricultural Commodities Act \nAmendments of 1995 (H.R. 1103). The President has also signed the \nEnergy and Water Development Appropriations Act (H.R. 1905) and the \nTransportation and Related Agencies Appropriations Act (H.R. 2002). \nCongress also cleared for the President's signature the Treasury, \nPostal Service and General Government Appropriations Act (H.R. 2020) \n\n[[Page S 17356]]\nand the Alaska Power Administration Sale Act. (S. 395). These actions, \nand the expiration of continuing resolution authority on November 13, \n1995, changed the current level of budget authority and outlays and \nrevenues. In addition, the revenue aggregates have been revised \npursuant to section 205(b)(2) of House Concurrent Resolution 67.\n  The report follows:\n                                      Congressional Budget Office,\n\n\n                                                U.S. Congress,\n\n                                Washington, DC, November 16, 1995.\n     Hon.

The estimates of \n     budget authority, outlays and revenues are consistent with \n     the technical and economic assumptions of the 1996 Concurrent \n     Resolution on the Budget (H. Con. Res. 67). This report is \n     submitted under Section 308(b) and in aid of Section 311 of \n     the Congressional Budget Act, as amended.\n       Since my last report, dated November 8, 1995, Congress \n     cleared and the President signed the Perishable Agricultural \n     Commodities Act Amendments of 1995 (H.R. 1103). The President \n     has also signed the Energy and Water Development \n     Appropriations Act (H.R. 1905) and the Transportation and \n     Related Agencies Appropriations Act (H.R. 2002). Congress \n     also cleared for the President's signature the Treasury, \n     Postal Service and General Government Appropriations Act \n     (H.R. 2020) and the Alaska Power Administration Sale Act (S. \n     395). These actions, and the expiration of continuing \n     resolution authority on November 13, 1995, changed the \n     current level of budget authority, outlays and revenues. In \n     addition, at the request of the Senate Committee on the \n     Budget, the revenue estimates for the concurrent resolution \n     have been revised, pursuant to Section 205(b)(2) of H.

Mr. President, I want to take a few moments to \ncomment on what happened last night in the other body with respect to \nthe issue of banning gifts to Members of Congress.\n  As my colleagues will recall, we had a very spirited and very \ncontentious debate on this issue just a few short months ago. We \nstarted with a proposal from the previous Congress, which would have \nbanned gifts and meals from lobbyists and allowed some gifts from non-\nlobbyists.\n  As a counterproposal, the distinguished Senator from Kentucky [Mr. \nMcConnell] offered a set of rules on gifts, that most of us recognized \nas being not much of a reform effort. That proposal, in fact, would \nhave allowed a Senator to accept an unlimited number of gifts under \n$100. By my math, if a Senator accepted a $100 gift from a single \nlobbyist every day of the year, that proposal would have allowed a \nSenator to accept $36,500 worth of gifts, at least, from a single \nlobbyist.\n  Recognizing how far apart the two sides were, my friend, the \ndistinguished Senator from Arizona [Mr. McCain] stepped forward with a \nthoughtful compromise, which essentially applied the executive branch \ngift rules to the U.S. Senate. The Senator from Arizona argued that \nwhat was good for the Secretary of State was good for a U.S. Senator, \nand of course, he was right.\n  After much good-faith negotiating, we ended up with a set of new gift \nrules that passed this body by a vote of 98 to nothing. It was a tough, \nfair and bipartisan compromise. Those new rules, effective this January \n1, will do the following:\n  First, Senators will be prohibited from accepting any gift with a \nvalue of more than $50. Moreover, Senators may not accept from any \nsingle source--lobbyists or non-lobbyists--more than $100 total in \ngifts under $50. Gifts under $10 will not count towards this $100 \nannual cap. We have also banned all travel that is substantially \nrecreational in nature, including these so-called charity trips that \noften double as expense-paid vacations for Members and their spouses.\n  But the key, Mr. President, to what we did in July, was that for the \nfirst time there is an aggregate cap on how many gifts Senators can \naccept from a single source. They cannot accept $36,500 in gifts from a \nsingle lobbyist and they cannot be wined and dined by the same lobbyist \nmore than a couple times a year.\n  Last night, I am pleased to report, the House of Representatives took \non the issue of banning gifts, and successfully passed legislation that \non a strong bipartisan vote that will essentially ban gifts to Members \nof the House.\n  Interestingly, the debate in the House was not all that different to \nthe debate we had here in the Senate. The House began with the Senate-\npassed language--that was the underlying language. But much like what \nhappened here in the Senate, there was an effort by the Gentleman from \nIndiana [Mr. Burton] to gut the Senate-passed language and merely \nprovide for phantom reform.\n  Had the Burton amendment passed, the House would have passed \nsomething that its supporters would have liked to have called a gift \nban, but what in reality would have been an enshrinement of the \noutrageous degree of gift giving that takes place in this city.\n  Current House rules allow Members to accept up to $250 worth of gifts \nfrom a single source. However, gifts under $100 do not count against \nthat aggregate limit. The Burton amendment \n\n[[Page S 17357]]\nwould have continued the current $250 cap, but would have now stated \nthat gifts under $50 would not count against the cap.\n  So instead of being allowed to accept at least $36,500 worth of gifts \nfrom a single lobbyist per year, a Member could have accepted at least \n$18,250 worth of gifts from a single lobbyist per year. For the \nproponents of the Burton amendment, that was their idea of reform.\n  It would have said to the American people that it is perfectly \nacceptable for Members of the House to accept an unlimited number of \ngifts from lobbyists. Thankfully, Mr. President, the Burton amendment \nmet the same fate as the original McConnell proposal. The Burton \namendment was, in fact, obliterated on the House floor by a vote of \n276-154.\n  Republicans and Democrats alike in the House stood up and said that \nthey were not going to continue the status quo, they were not going to \nsnub their noses at the American people, and they were going to finally \ngive the American people the kind of gift reform they have been asking \nfor some time now.\n  The House, in fact, went on to pass a watertight gift ban, one very \nsimilar to the rule of the Wisconsin State Legislature which \nessentially prohibits legislators from accepting anything of value. By \nan overwhelming bipartisan vote of 422-6, the House passed a new gift \nrule that is essentially a zero-tolerance rule. It prohibits the \nacceptance of free gifts, meals and recreational trips.\n  There is no $10 de minimis. There is no $50 limit on single gifts and \nthere is no $100 limit on aggregate gifts. The House, beginning January \n1, will simply prohibit the acceptance of any gifts, other than those \nof little intrinsic value.\n  For 20 years, Mr. President, the Wisconsin State Legislature has \nlived under such a zero-tolerance policy and has achieved a national \nreputation for its sense of ethics and integrity government. Since I \ncame to the U.S. Senate, my office has lived under these Wisconsin \nrules, and we have essentially created a gift-free zone in our Senate \noffice building. It has been our experience that it is not all that \ndifficult to say ``no thanks\" to the lobbyists.\n  Though long overdue, this represents another step on the road to \nmeaningful reform of our political process, and I offer my strongest \npraise and commendation for the actions taken by our colleagues in the \nHouse last night.\n  As I have said countless times since I first set foot in Washington \nnearly 3 years ago, it is my preference that the Senate also abide by \nthese Wisconsin-style rules. No gifts, no trips, no free meals. Those \nare the rules my office lives by and those are the rules that the \nWisconsin Legislature has had in place for 20 years.\n  If the Senate rules can one day be changed so we are on equal ground \nwith the House, I will be the first to stand up and fight for such a \nchange. But the Senate rules are tough, they are fair, and they will \nhave a profound impact on changing the culture of special interest \ninfluence that has pervaded this institution for so many years.\n  I want to briefly acknowledge some of my colleagues in the other \nbody, from both sides of the aisle, who fought the good fight and were \ninstrumental in the House's successful effort. I want to thank \nCongressman John Bryant for his longstanding leadership on this issue, \nas well as Representatives Chris Shays and Tom Barrett, who recognized \nhow important bipartisan cooperation and compromise is to this process.\n  Mr. President, the fight to reform the ways of Washington is far from \nover. The gift ban is just the first skirmish. We will insist on \npassage of lobbying reform legislation. We will insist that the \nCongress take up legislation to shut down the revolving door between \npublic service and special access lobbying. And most important, we will \ninsist that the Congress take up meaningful and comprehensive campaign \nfinance reform.\n  Like the gift rules that have now passed both the House and Senate, \nnone of these efforts will be successful without bipartisan leadership. \nReforming this institution, and working to restore the faith and trust \nof the American people should not be a partisan issue. It does not make \nyou a good Democrat, or a good Republican--it simply makes you a good \nAmerican.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/11/17/senate-section/article/S17356-1", "month": "11", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "17", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S17357-S17358]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       TIME TO BALANCE THE BUDGET\n\n Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I made a pledge to the people of my \nState last year that I would fight hard in the U.S. Senate to limit \nGovernment spending, reduce taxes, and cut the size of Government. I \ndid not say that just to get elected. I did not say it just to \ncompromise once I got to Washington. I meant what I said.\n  Mr. President, our government has been spending the Nation into \nbankruptcy. It has been taxing our people into mediocrity. By trying to \ndo too much for all of us, it has--in the words of former Education \nSecretary Bill Bennett, ``created inefficiency, sapped individual \nresponsibility, and intruded on personal liberty.''\n  The people of Arizona--the people of the United States--did not send \nus here to split the difference with the President when it comes to \nlimiting spending, cutting taxes, or balancing the budget. In fact, \nthey tossed out the Members of Congress whose only solution was the \nPresident's solution: to tax more, spend more, and expand Government. \nThey did not send us here for more of the same.\n  The American people sent us here to make the difficult decisions to \nput our Nation's fiscal house in order, and they expect us to do it. As \nof this morning, calls and faxes to my office were running 10-to-1 in \nsupport of our staying the course. The great majority know this is \ncrunch time; that it is no time for weak knees and hand-wringing.\n  Mr. President, this is the fourth day of the Government's partial \nshutdown, and do you know what? The sky has not fallen. The economy has \nnot collapsed. People have not stopped sending their kids to school, \nvolunteering in their communities, or doing their part to clean up the \nenvironment. I suspect that many people haven't even noticed that the \nGovernment has been shut down.\n  Now I know the shutdown has caused hardship and anxiety for many \nFederal employees. We did not ask for that to happen. Congress passed \nlegislation earlier this week to keep them on the job and keep them \npaid. The President vetoed that bill and sent them home.\n  We passed a second bill yesterday to try to get Federal employees \nback to work--to process Social Security claims and VA widows' \nbenefits, to pay our military, and fund educational and environmental \nclean-up activities. The bill will ensure that these employees are paid \nbefore the holidays, but the President has said that he will veto it, \ntoo. In fact, President Clinton is threatening to keep parts of the \nGovernment shut down, ``even if it is 90 days, 120 days or 180 days.'' \nTalk about blackmail: it is the President who is holding the Government \nhostage until Congress gives him more of the American people's money to \nspend.\n  If President Clinton is so bound and determined to prolong this \nsuspension, maybe we should ask ourselves why he thinks he can get away \nwith it. The President's own Office of Management and Budget has \ndetermined that 67 percent of the Commerce Department's staff was \n``non-essential'' and sent them home. OMB determined that 99 percent--\nthat is right, 99 percent--of the staff at the Department of Housing \nand Urban Development was non-essential. It determined that 89 percent \nof the Education Department's staff was non-essential. That is \naccording to President Clinton's own Office of Management and Budget.\n  If the President makes good on his pledge to keep the Government shut \ndown for 90 to 180 days, I guess the Nation will have a chance to see \nif he is right that the great majority of his own Commerce, HUD and \nEducation workers are non-essential. Maybe we do not need all of those \npeople after all. Maybe the President is on to something. We will have \na chance to examine that later.\n  Mr. President, what can it be, though, that the administration \nobjects to in the latest spending? President Clinton said he would \naccept no riders. There are none in this bill. There is nothing in here \nabout tax cuts, nothing about Medicare, nothing about the environment. \nThis is a clean bill that represents a good-faith effort to get \nGovernment operating in the \n\n[[Page S 17358]]\nshort term. Yet, he still says he will veto it.\n  I will tell you this, Mr. President. For me, this measure represents \nmy bottom line. In return for giving President Clinton the money to \nreopen the Government, we are asking for one simple thing: for the \nPresident to commit to a balanced budget in 7 years using real numbers.\n  That should be easy. It is something he says he wants anyway. Just \nTuesday of this week, he said: ``Let me be clear: we must balance the \nbudget.''\n  In 1992, he pledged to balance the budget in just 5 years. Since \nthen, he has said he could support a plan to balance the budget in 10 \nyears, 9 years, 8 years and 7. So, if he really means what he says, he \nshould be able to support a balanced budget in 7 years, as we are \nproposing.\n  In his State of the Union message in 1993, he promised to judge the \nscope of the problem by the very same criteria that Congress uses, so \nthat together we can find viable solutions. Here is what he told the \nAmerican people on February 17, 1993 in his State of the Union message:\n\n       Well, you can laugh, my fellow Republicans, but I will \n     point out that the Congressional Budget Office was normally \n     more conservative in what was going to happen and closer to \n     right than previous presidents have been.\n\n  He went on to say:\n\n       In the last 12 years, because there were differences over \n     the revenue estimates, you and I know that both parties were \n     given greater elbow room for irresponsibility. This [that is, \n     using CBO numbers] is tightening the rein on the Democrats as \n     well as the Republicans. Let us at least argue about the same \n     set of numbers so the American people will think we are \n     shooting straight with them.\n\n  I hope the President will remember his words and how important it is \nto use credible numbers to get to a balanced budget. It is important \nbecause, according to a recent Wall Street Journal report, his own \nTreasury Department just ``tweaked'' its economic forecasts to show \n$475 billion more in Government revenue by the year 2000.\n  Mr. President, tweaks will not get us to a balanced budget. That is \nthe same irresponsible approach that has kept the deficit in the range \nof $200 billion for so many years. And it is why the Congressional \nBudget Office projects that President Clinton's so-called ``balanced \nbudget'', a budget the Senate unanimously rejected on two separate \noccasions this year--will result in $200 billion deficits for the \nforeseeable future. Let me say that again, President Clinton's budget \ndid not get the vote of any Senator, even from his own party.\n  Even our Democrat colleague from North Dakota, Senator Dorgan, \ncandidly said in this Chamber on October 24 that: ``The President did \nnot propose a budget that calls for a balanced budget.'' So, there is \nnothing partisan in recognizing that President Clinton has never \nproposed--never sent to Congress--the balanced budget he claims he \nwants.\n  Two days ago, President Clinton appeared on a news program and talked \nabout how he would veto the balanced budget because he knows what is \nbest for the country. Well, that is the problem, Mr. President. The \nAmerican people do not want Washington--they do not trust Washington--\nto decide what is best for them. In a poll just conducted by the \nBehavior Research Center in Arizona, 58 percent of people said that \nthey put their trust in the people of their own communities. Only 10 \npercent indicated their confidence in the Federal Government.\n  The American people know what is best for them. They do not need a \nnational nanny in the White House to make every decision for them--to \ndecide how to spend the money they work hard to earn. This balanced \nbudget is about empowering American families to make their own \ndecisions about how to lead their lives and make their communities \nbetter places.\n  A balanced budget will save the average family of four an estimated \n$2,791 per year. It means lower mortgage payments, less money paid out \non car loans and student loans. It means more jobs. It means that our \nchildren and grandchildren will have an opportunity to do more than \njust work hard to pay the interest on the debt we are accumulating \ntoday.\n  So this is the bottom line. I supported this latest short-term \nspending bill. But I will not support any further stop-gap measures \nthat do not, at a minimum, commit to a balanced budget in 7 years using \nreal numbers.\n  We can compromise on how to get there, but I will not compromise on \nthe fundamental principle of a balanced budget. The Nation's economic \nsecurity is too important to delay any more.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/11/17/senate-section/article/S17357-1", "month": "11", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "17", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S17358-S17359]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         LA COLLINE RESTAURANT\n\n  Mr. HEFLIN. Mr. President, for several years, La Colline \nrestaurant has been designated by Washingtonian magazine as one of the \narea's best eating establishments. To those of us on Capitol Hill, it \nhas become somewhat of an institution.\n  Last month, the magazine Report on Business designated our own La \nColline as one of the world's 20 best restaurants for business, \nreflecting a national, even international, following.\n  On behalf of the Senate, I congratulate my friends at La Colline for \nreceiving this honor, and ask that the Report on Business article on La \nColline be printed in the Record.\n  The article follows:\n\n                [From Report on Business, October 1995]\n\n                           ``I Know a Place''\n\n       The largest media merger in U.S. history was set in motion \n     by a chat, over dinner, between Disney chairman Michael \n     Eisner and Capital Cities chairman Thomas Murphy. It's not \n     important that we know exactly what the two men ate, or \n     whether the chef is now entertaining bids for the movie \n     rights to the menu. What's important is that $19 billion \n     (U.S.) eventually changed hands because something about the \n     style, the personality, the rightness of the setting allowed \n     two executives to get friendly over food. No one says the \n     outcome of a working lunch hinges on the amount of lemongrass \n     deployed in the scallop ravioli. But when you're dealing \n     while you dine, selecting the right restaurant matters. At \n     home, you know what works, which place fits the tenor and \n     times of your business. You may even know the name of the \n     maitre d', and so you get the right table, and Marco brings \n     the S. Pellegrino with lime without you even having to ask. \n     When you're out in the world, on someone else's turf, \n     selecting the ideal spot for Tuesday's get-to-know-session \n     gets trickier. One wants to be au courant (nothing could be \n     deadlier than appearing drastically out of date), but one \n     wants not to be brushing chairs with the latest grunge music \n     phenoms. Once you sit down, applying the rules that work at \n     home can be disastrous--every city's corporate style is \n     different. Many Atlantans like to brandish a smoking stogie \n     the first chance they get. Try that in Toronto and waiters \n     will pull back your thumbs until you cry. To help you avoid \n     the pitfalls among the profiteroles, we've enlisted writers \n     familiar with the current attitudes and idiosyncracies of the \n     corporate communities in 18 of the world's most important \n     cities.

As each \n     new patron arrives in the dining room, eyes rise, flick \n     across the newcomer, and return to the conservation at hand. \n     If you're Newt Gingrich, the lunch-hour chatter will stop. \n     But since you're not, it won't.\n       This rite of tribal life in status-obsessed Washington, \n     D.C., has been taking place for more than 13 years at La \n     Colline, the definitive establishment restaurant on Capitol \n     Hill. Two blocks of lawn from the senate side of the Capitol \n     Building, La Colline is one of the closest restaurants to the \n     legislative centre. Under the guidance of co-owner and \n     executive chef Robert Greault, La Colline has kept its large \n     green-carpeted dining room filled by sticking to the \n     Escoffier basics in a town that, whatever the politics of the \n     moment, remains a bastion of cultural conservatism. It was \n     (modestly) revolutionary last year when Greault decided to \n     institute seasonal menus. But regulars--lobbists, lawyers and \n     other congressional congregants--didn't have to worry. Along \n     with such new arrivals as blackened tuna and a few pasta \n     dishes, survive the old standbys: vichyssoise, lobster \n     bisque, steak and fries, medallions of pork and eggs \n     Benedict.\n       Because Washingtonians tend to work through dinner, lunch \n     is when to join the local crowd. You have to be fast, though. \n     The efficient and attentive service is designed to meet the \n     Washington rule of the 45-minute lunch. Like the restaurant, \n     the wine list is conventional and not exorbitantly priced. \n     If, however, you wish to emulate the denizens, iced tea or \n     sparkling water are your drink of choice.\n     \n[[Page S 17359]]\n\n\n             DESPITE LEGAL ISSUES, VIRTUAL DICE ARE ROLLING\n\n Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I ask that the following article be \nprinted in the Record.\n\n                    [From USA Today, Nov. 17, 1995]\n\n             Despite Legal Issues, Virtual Dice Are Rolling\n\n                          (By Linda Kanamine)\n\n       Forget Las Vegas. Skip Atlantic City.\n       In an instant, on-line card games, slots, roulette, keno, \n     craps and sports betting could be available to everyone with \n     a computer and a phone.\n       Everyone is ready--the games, the virtual casinos, even a \n     new way to pay.\n       Billions of dollars are riding on just one more thing, the \n     government's OK.\n       But so far, law officials are saying ``No dice.'' The \n     technology may be fine, but there's no protection for \n     bettors.\n       ``People are literally being asked to send money to \n     somebody 4,000 miles away, who is not regulated and not \n     controlled,'' says Minnesota Deputy Attorney General Tom \n     Pursell. ``Just give him your credit card number and trust \n     him to tell you when you've won. Now, what's wrong with this \n     picture?''\n       Even as law enforcement balks at virtual casinos, the vast, \n     unregulated Internet computer network has about 200 gambling-\n     related sites.\n       While most are how-to-play tutorials or ads for future \n     games, a handful are defiantly taking wagers.\n       ``The vice watchers are really taking a look at this,'' \n     says Jeff Frentzen, who follows Internet trends for PC Week \n     magazine. ``The Internet is insecure. It's become a major \n     hot-button issue and there will be many attempts to put \n     controls on it.''\n       But how to control it?\n       Upstart operators already are in business in the Caribbean \n     and Liechtenstein as they capitalize on the appeal of gaming.\n       Players, propelled by a new electronic cash system that \n     replaces credit cards, already can click their computer mice \n     on a handful of on-line sites and place their bets.\n       Most of those still look like a kid's video game. \n     Blackjack? Your cards come up under the dealers' hand, you \n     choose ``hit'' or ``stay,'' the computer adds up your cards \n     for you. Roulette? The wheel turns on screen as you click \n     your ``red'' or ``black,'' ``even'' or ``odd'' numbers.\n       Some are clearly adults-only. Sex World, for instance, \n     features topless female dealers.\n       Still, it's hardly the $10 billion bonanza that gambling \n     afficionados predicted would explode across the Internet six \n     months ago. Gambling enthusiasts remain worried about \n     ripoffs.\n       The first court challenge comes in December when Minnesota \n     Attorney General Hubert ``Skip'' Humphrey Jr. tries to stop \n     Las Vegas-based Granite Gate Resorts Inc. from offering on-\n     line gambling.\n       Humphrey says simply advertising a future service is \n     consumer fraud because federal and state laws bar betting \n     over communications wires or with credit cards.\n       ``We're trying to raise the issue before the cat's out of \n     the bag with this,'' says Pursell, his deputy. ``This sets a \n     precedent on dealing with the Internet in general.''\n       Policing computer users could ultimately affect cyberspace, \n     from chat rooms and shopping to pornography and, of course, \n     gambling. But blocking computer gambling may be tougher than \n     hitting a royal flush.\n       A recent study found nearly 37 million people in the USA \n     and Canada now have access to the Internet.\n       And polls have found at least 65% of adults have gambled, \n     from lotteries and office pools to illegal sports bets. \n     Wagering on legal games (casinos, lotteries and racetracks) \n     has skyrocketed from $17 billion in 1976 to $480 billion last \n     year and more than $500 billion this year.\n       Last month, St. Louis' Mark Twain Bank opened the first \n     electronic-cash accounts. The bank turns account dollars into \n     e-cash credits, which the customer spends on-line. The \n     customer sends an encrypted code to the bank, which approves \n     the payment.\n       ``I absolutely believe there will be billion-dollar \n     companies 10 years from now doing interactive gambling,'' \n     says Colleen Anderson, president of IWN Inc. in Carlsbad, \n     Calif., which develops interactive gambling programs.\n       ``The potential is phenomenal. But we've got big hurdles to \n     get over, like the regulations to say it's legal,'' she adds.\n       Meanwhile, entrepreneurs have headed offshore to take \n     advantage of lax regulations abroad and the distance from \n     U.S. law enforcement officials.\n       Many, like 34-year-old Toronto businessman Warren Eugene, \n     are betting that U.S. agents will be too busy to bother with \n     at-home gamblers.\n       His Internet Casinos is run from the Caribbean islands of \n     Turks and Caicos. Click onto the site's home page and an eye-\n     patched pirate runs a hand through coins and jewels \n     overflowing a treasure chest at this ``Caribbean Casino.''\n       Registered players with passwords choose from 18 games, \n     including Asian favorites, and casino themes ranging from the \n     cowboys-in-leather West World to the topless Sex World.\n       In five months, he claims 25,000 have registered to play; \n     2,800 from Canada, Europe and especially Asia bet regularly. \n     Casino jackpots have paid up to $1,400 and a football bet \n     ``well over $100,000.''\n       With 22% of the gross going to the company--far higher than \n     Las Vegas casinos, which hold about 8%--and no sizeable \n     overhead costs, Eugene predicts ``huge, huge, huge profits, \n     almost obscene profits.''\n       He says he doesn't accept U.S. gamblers unless they have an \n     offshore bank account and even warns Americans on the home \n     page to stay away.\n       There's no such warning on one of the newest gambling \n     sites, a weekly Lotto run by the government of tiny \n     Liechtenstein. Launched Oct. 7, it promises a minimum weekly \n     jackpot of $1 million.\n       Justice Department officials concede gambling isn't a top \n     priority. ``The Internet, we have no set policy,'' says \n     spokesman John Russell. ``It's a very exciting time to be in \n     law enforcement looking at these issues. The scope is so \n     obviously huge.''\n       Yet most law enforcement agents insist that gambling is so \n     stigmatized by links with organized crime, scandals and fraud \n     that it must be regulated.\n       Critics say virtual casinos will increased debt and social \n     angst. ``People will get involved over their heads,'' says Ed \n     Looney of the Council on Compulsive Gambling in New Jersey.\n       ``On-line hits a bunch of people who are the shut-ins, who \n     will now have access to a casino,'' he says.\n       And many will be underage wagering behind the anonymity of \n     a modem and their parents' credit cards.\n       So where is all this going?\n       ``There isn't a lot of activity yet. I think there's a \n     wait-and-see attitude while the martyrs go out and . . . make \n     the mistakes,'' says PC Week's Frentzen. ``The Internet is a \n     free system. It was never intended to be used for commercial \n     purposes. The biggest hurdle will be consumer confidence, is \n     this safe?''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/11/17/senate-section/article/S17358-1", "month": "11", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "17", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S17359]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     WALTER J. BROWN: A TRUE FRIEND\n\n Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, it is with great sadness that I \nrise today to pay tribute to one of my dearest friends, Walter J. Brown \nof Spartanburg, who passed away this morning at the age of 92. My \npersonal sense of loss is compounded as the city of Spartanburg and the \nentire State of South Carolina also will miss Walter's warmth, service, \ngenerosity, and integrity.\n  Mr. President, Walter Brown was a pioneer in television and the \ncommunications industry in South Carolina. As founder in 1940 of the \nSpartan Radiocasting Co., now Spartan Communications, Inc., Walter \nbuilt WSPA into a broadcasting powerhouse. His WSPA-AM was South \nCarolina's first radio station. Similarly, WSPA-FM was the State's \nfirst FM station and the first to broadcast in stereo in the Southeast.\n  But Walter Brown's crowning achievement is how he built WSPA-TV into \na CBS stronghold in the Piedmont area. First on the air in 1956, WSPA-\nTV is known throughout South Carolina and the South as a premier \nbroadcaster that reports the news, but also works to better the \ncommunity.\n  Mr. President, Walter Brown was born in Bowman, GA. He was educated \nat Georgia Tech and the University of Georgia's Henry W. Grady School \nof Journalism. After managing his own news bureau in Washington, DC, he \nmoved to Spartanburg to continue his career in journalism.\n  During World War II, Mr. Brown returned to Washington to serve as a \nspecial assistant to James F. Byrnes--before and during the times when \nhe was Secretary of State. Later, after he had returned to Spartanburg, \nhe wrote a book that remembered all that Senator Byrnes had done for \nthe Nation.\n  Mr. President, in the years since I was Lieutenant Governor in the \n1950s, Walter Brown was my close friend and adviser. I will miss the \nwise counsel that Walter provided--not only politically but on the full \nrange of communications issues. He was fair, insightful, and visionary. \nOur loss is the Nation's loss.\n  Mr. President, as we mourn the loss of Walter Brown, let's remember \nhow he made South Carolina a better place. Our prayers are with his \nfamily during this difficult time.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/11/17/senate-section/article/S17359-1", "month": "11", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "17", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S17359-S17360]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      STAMPING OUT THE LITTLE GUYS\n\n  Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, Victor Navasky, publisher of the Nation and \nmany years ago an aide to Senator Ed Muskie, recently had an item in \nthe Washington Post that we ought to be paying attention to; and I hope \nthe Postal Rate Commission will look at carefully.\n  What the Postal Service should be doing is encouraging the free flow \nof ideas.\n  We talk about the melting pot strength of America sometimes as if it \n\n[[Page S 17360]]\n  were a breeding process. The Italians marry the Germans and the Germans \nmarry the Chinese and so forth. In fact the melting pot strength of \nAmerica is the cross-fertilization of ideas. And anything that weakens \nthat flow of ideas weakens America.\n  Journals like the Nation and their counterparts on the conservative \nside render a huge public service.\n  It is of interest to me to note that as you look at the rise in the \nrate of delivering packages containing everything from diapers to \ncashews, the increase in the rate of growth of sending these through \nthe Postal Service has not been as great as the increase in sending \nideas through the mail.\n  Frankly, Federal Express and United Postal Service and all their \ncounterparts can deliver diapers and cashews just as well as the postal \nservice. But the Postal Service provides the ideas that are important \nto the Nation.\n  One other item that I frankly was not aware of until I read Victor \nNavasky's column op-ed piece was that ``periodicals heavy in editorial \ncontent * * * will for the first time be charged postage by the mile.''\n  If that is accurate, and I am asking my staff to check that out right \nnow, that is a great disservice. People in Alaska or Hawaii or the \nremotest U.S. territory should have the opportunity for ideas as much \nas people that live in Chicago or New York City or Washington, DC.\n  I ask that the Victor Navasky op-ed piece be printed in the Record \nand I urge my colleagues to read it.\n  The material follows:\n\n  Stamping Out the Little Guys--Don't Let Postal Rate Reform Crush Us \n                        Small Opinion Magazines\n\n                          (By Victor Navasky)\n\n       The Founding Fathers saw the circulation of opinion and \n     intelligence as a condition of self-governance, and a postal \n     service as the circulatory system of democracy. That is why, \n     among other reasons, Benjamin Franklin agreed to serve as \n     postmaster general. That is why Thomas Jefferson sought to \n     persuade President Washington to appoint Thomas Paine as \n     postmaster general. That is why Washington himself believed \n     that all newspapers--which in those days were frequently \n     partisan, radical and rabblerousing--should be delivered free \n     of charge.\n       And that is why (not to put myself in such illustrious \n     company) I agreed to add my two pence to the 17,000 pages of \n     testimony accumulated by the Postal Rate Commission, which is \n     considering a proposal that would undermine the postal \n     principle deemed by the Founding Fathers to be essential to \n     the enlightenment of the Republic. Namely, preferential \n     treatment for carriers of information and opinion.\n       While we have heard too much about how Time Warner's rap \n     records have contributed to the degradation of public \n     discourse, we have heard too little about how lawyer-\n     lobbyists for Time Warner and Dow Jones are pushing a \n     proposed postal ``reform.'' Its main consequence would be to \n     reward advertising-crammed mass magazines and newspapers and \n     penalize small periodicals. It would especially hurt those \n     with the highest percentage of editorial content, such as the \n     journal of opinion whose financially precarious business it \n     is to carry on the policy debate that democracy requires. To \n     German philosopher Juergen Habermas, such journals are house \n     organs to the public sphere and their role is nothing less \n     than ``to set the standard for reasoned argumentation.''\n       One would have thought that the Magazine Publishers of \n     America, which in theory represents all magazines large and \n     small, would sound the alarm. But no, that job has been left \n     to the American Business Press, which represents mostly \n     smaller publications. Whether or not it is because a minority \n     of its members, including Time Warner, pay a majority of its \n     dues, MPA, along with the Postal Service, has been \n     aggressively promoting a reclassification scheme whose \n     consequence will be a de facto transfer of expense from \n     magazines with a circulation in the millions, like People, to \n     magazines with comparatively small circulations, among them \n     the Nation.\n       On the surface, the reclassification proposal makes free-\n     market sense. The plan would divide what is now second-class \n     mail into two sub-classes and reward those periodicals that \n     save the Postal Service sorting time and shipping costs by \n     giving them a lower rate. The catch, however, is that for the \n     most part, only the nation's largest magazines will qualify \n     for the lower rate. Periodicals that do not have 24 or more \n     subscribers in 90 percent of the relevant ZIP codes need not \n     apply. Magazines too small to print regional editions and \n     hire private trucks to deliver them to regional post offices \n     will suffer. So will periodicals heavy in editorial content \n     (which will for the first time be charged postage by the \n     mile, reversing nearly two centuries of postal policy \n     favoring editorial content over advertising). And so too will \n     those without the technology to do what is quaintly known as \n     ``pre-sortation'' (sorting in advance by ZIP code, which the \n     Nation does but some of our smaller siblings can't).\n       Time Warner and other biggies will save millions on their \n     postal rates; journals of opinion and most magazines with \n     circulations under 100,000 will pay at least 17 percent more. \n     No wonder, then, that the Postal Rate Commission's own Office \n     of the Consumer Advocate denounced the plan because it would \n     offer ``deeper discounts only to the largest and most \n     technologically sophisticated mailers.''\n       So the Postal Service would turn the historic mission of \n     second-class mail on its head. Until now, the independent \n     Postal Rate Commission has barred the door against those who \n     would drive the public-interest factor out of the rate-making \n     process. It would be a tragedy if, at a time of unprecedented \n     media concentration, one of the few remaining institutions \n     dedicated to the propagation, circulation and testing of new \n     policy ideas--the journal of opinion--were the casualty of \n     lobbying by the very forces making it more important than \n     ever that the independent voice be heard--whether the Nation, \n     the New Republic or the new Weekly Standard.\n       The Postal Service is chartered as a public service and, as \n     economist Robert Nathan testified on behalf of the American \n     Business Press, it cannot and should not adopt, ``in the \n     guise of abstract economics, the profit-maximizing strategies \n     of private enterprise.''\n       In September, Loren Smith, ``chief marketing officer'' of \n     the Postal Service, sent a form letter extolling the reform \n     proposals on cost-saving grounds, conceding that some \n     magazines would get hit with higher costs but suggesting that \n     even these might achieve savings through ``co-mailing.''\n       Thus, when I appeared before the Postal Rate Commission in \n     October to make the case I have outlined above, I was not \n     surprised to be asked why the Nation couldn't qualify for the \n     lower rate category either by co-mailing with other weeklies \n     (time and logistics would make that impractical) or by \n     cutting isolated subscribers from our rolls (business and \n     social policy considerations would make that invidious).\n       What I didn't expect was to be cross-examined (on colonial \n     history, yet) by counsel from both Time Warner and Dow Jones. \n     They made much of the fact that in the 1790s Congress had \n     singled out newspapers but not magazines for preferred \n     treatment. That is a neat debater's point, but as historian \n     Donald Stewart has documented, by far the greatest number of \n     newspapers in those days were weeklies, the line between \n     newspapers and magazines was murky at best (both were called \n     journals), and the highly partisan colonial press was the \n     equivalent of today's journal of opinion.\n       When asked, inter alia, the source for my assertion that \n     Jefferson had nominated Paine for postmaster general, I \n     happily cited a Jan. 31, 1974, editorial commentary by Arthur \n     Schlesinger Jr. from the Wall Street Journal's editorial \n     page. This perhaps is what prompted counsel to ask, in the \n     three-and-a-half-hour colloquy's most esoteric query: Could I \n     name any job from which citizen Paine had not been fired? I \n     thought the question a non sequitur, but it did occur to me \n     that these too are times that try men's souls.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/11/17/senate-section/article/S17359-2", "month": "11", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "17", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S17360-S17361]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CLARIFICATION OF VA AUTHORITY\n\n Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, earlier this week, I heard the \nSenator from Texas [Mrs. Hutchison], both on the floor and elsewhere, \nexpress her view that VA has existing authority to pay veterans' \nbenefits during this time of the shutdown of the Federal Government. In \nsome of those statements, she indicated that she had received legal \nopinions, including from the Congressional Research Service, which \nsupported this position.\n  Because I was vitally interested in this issue, I asked Veterans' \nAffairs Committee staff to acquire copies of these opinions and advise \nme of their content. Initial inquiries found that CRS had not issued \nany opinion on this issue. However, today, an opinion, authored by \nMorton Rosenberg, Specialist in American Public Law in the American Law \nDivision of CRS, was issued. In the most relevant passage, the opinion \nstates--\n\n       Veterans' benefits are entitlements, but since they are \n     entitlements that require annual appropriations, the absence \n     of spending authority, either through an appropriations \n     measure or a continuing resolution, appears to preclude the \n     scheduled payments by VA or by the Treasury Department \n     through the tapping of a trust fund.\n\n  This certainly seems clear to me and should resolve any lingering \nconfusion over VA's authority to pay benefits during this period when \nthere is no appropriation in effect.\n  Mr. President, I ask that the full text of the opinion be printed in \nthe Record.\n  The material follows:\n\n[[Page S 17361]]\n\n                                   Congressional Research Service,\n\n\n                                      The Library of Congress,\n\n                                Washington, DC, November 17, 1995.\n     Subject: Necessity of Appropriations Legislation to Pay \n       Compensation and Pension Benefits By The Department of \n       Veterans' Affairs on December 1, 1995.\n     Author: Morton Rosenberg, Specialist in American Public Law.\n\n       The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) has advised that if \n     a continuing resolution is not enacted into law by November \n     22, 1995, compensation and benefit checks scheduled to be \n     mailed on December 1 would be delayed. Two questions are \n     raised. First, are veterans' compensation and premium \n     benefits entitlements? Second, if they are entitlements, \n     isn't the government obligated to pay them on time, even if \n     appropriations for the payments have not been passed, such as \n     by tapping the civil service retirement fund?\n       Veterans' benefits are entitlements, but since they are \n     entitlements that require annual appropriations, the absence \n     of spending authority, either through an appropriations \n     measure or a continuing resolution, appears to preclude the \n     scheduled payments by VA or by the Treasury Department \n     through the tapping of a trust fund.\n       Both the Constitution and federal statutory law place \n     specific limits on what government entities may do in the \n     absence of appropriated funds. The Constitution prohibits the \n     withdrawal of any money from the Treasury ``but in \n     Consequence of Appropriations made by the Law,'' U.S. \n     Constit. art. I, sec. 9, cl. 7. By the terms of this clause, \n     government entities may continue to obligate funds during a \n     temporary lapse in appropriations, but they may not pay out \n     any monies. This gap has been closed by the Antideficiency \n     Act which prohibits the obligation of funds under such \n     circumstances. Under that Act, it is a crime for an official \n     or employee of the United States Government or of the \n     District of Columbia to make expenditures in excess of \n     appropriations or involve the Government ``in a contract or \n     obligation for the payment of money before an appropriation \n     is made unless authorized by law.'' 31 U.S.C. 1341(a)(1) \n     (1988). The Act also prohibits any officer from accepting \n     ``voluntary services,'' or ``employ[ing] personal services \n     exceeding that authorized by law except for emergencies \n     involving the safety of human life or the protection of \n     Property''. 31 U.S.C. 1342. The exceptions clause was amended \n     in 1990 to specifically preclude ``ongoing, regular functions \n     of the government the suspension of which would not \n     imminently threaten the safety of human life or the \n     protection of property.'' Id. Thus on its face the Act \n     appears to leave little room for the continuance of most \n     government functions in advance of appropriations.\n       It is clear that veterans' compensation and pension \n     benefits are ``entitlements''. See, e.g., 38 U.S.C. 310. \n     However, there are two types of entitlements: (1) Those that \n     have permanent appropriations contained in authorizing \n     legislation. These do not require funding through annual \n     appropriation acts. The leading example is social security \n     legislation and its trust funds mechanism. See 42 U.S.C. 401. \n     (2) Also, there are those entitlements authorized in basic \n     legislation for which funding is provided in annual \n     appropriations acts. Veterans' compensation and pension \n     benefits fall within this latter category. See Departments of \n     Veterans' Affairs and Housing and Urban Development, and \n     Independent Agencies Appropriations Act, 1995, Pub. L. 103-\n     327. As a consequence, the congressional failure to enact an \n     annual appropriation act or a further continuing resolution \n     constrains the VA's authority to spend, both with respect to \n     the benefits themselves and the personnel necessary to \n     administer the programs. VA therefore appears to be acting \n     within the parameters of the Department of Justice and Office \n     of Management and Budget guidelines for funding lapses. There \n     are no ``no-year or multi-year or other funds available''. \n     However, if funding legislation is passed, even after \n     November 22, VA would then be properly authorized to issue \n     checks and personnel necessary to issue them would be \n     available.\n       The coincidence of the current debt limit situation \n     provides no additional option for payment of the benefits. \n     Reaching the debt limit and the failure to provide \n     appropriations are distinctly different problems that are \n     accompanied by different consequences and solutions. By law \n     the total amount of government debt that may be outstanding \n     is limited to $4.9 trillion. 31 U.S.C. 3101(b). When that \n     limit is reached, if Congress has not increased it, the \n     government must rely on taxes and miscellaneous receipts such \n     as loan deposits and fees to replenish its operating \n     balances. In essence, it must go on a cash basis. The \n     statutory debt ceiling, therefore, limits the ability of \n     government agencies to exercise spending authority that they \n     have received in a appropriations measure because the \n     Treasury will, at some point, not take in sufficient receipts \n     to pay for all appropriated actions.\n       In contrast, a funding lapse involves the authority of \n     agencies to spend money. Thus appropriations lapses and \n     reaching the debt ceiling limit present distinct budgetary \n     and legal issues for VA. The Department's decision to delay \n     payments rests upon its lack of spending authority in the \n     first place. There is no question of inability to pay. \n     Indeed, in the absence of appropriations we are not aware of \n     any legal basis for making the benefits payments by tapping, \n     for instance, the civil service retirement fund for such and \n     unfunded purpose. Stated differently, the lack of VA spending \n     authority leaves Treasury without any apparent legal \n     authority to use retirement trust fund resources or any other \n     available monies for activities which have not been \n     authorized ``in Consequence of Appropriations made by the \n     Law''. What the Treasury is doing now is paying obligations \n     that have come due either by using current revenues or by \n     tapping the civil service retirement fund or the G fund, as \n     authorized by statutes governing those funds. These \n     obligations--unlike the VA entitlements--arise from \n     activities for which appropriations have been \n     enacted.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/11/17/senate-section/article/S17360-1", "month": "11", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "17", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S17361]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 UNANIMOUS-CONSENT REQUEST-- H.R. 2127\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to the immediate consideration of H.R. 2127, the Labor-HHS \nappropriations bill, and that the language on page 21, lines 3 to 10, \nrelating to striker replacement, be stricken; that all other committee \namendments be agreed to en bloc; that the bill be read a third time and \npassed; and that the motion to reconsider be laid upon the table, with \nthe above occurring without intervening action or debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I object to that at this point.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I will not take much time. I knew that \nwould be objected to. I just want to say we had hot lined this on our \nside and hot lined it on the Republican side.\n  I just want the Record to show that there are no objections to this \nunanimous consent request on the Democratic side.\n  I will also state for the Record, I repeat from the Record of \nSeptember 29, 1995, in a colloquy among this Senator, Senator Specter \nand Senator Dole, the majority leader, when we tried to bring up the \nLabor-HHS appropriations bill.\n  Senator Dole, the Senate majority leader, said and I quote from the \nRecord of September 29, 1995:\n\n       I agree with the Senator from Pennsylvania and the Senator \n     from Iowa that we ought to pass that bill on a voice vote. We \n     cannot get cloture. There are two votes, 54-46 party line \n     votes.\n\n  And he is referring here to the striker replacement votes.\n\n       So my view is we ought to do it, pass it and find out what \n     happens after the veto in the next round.\n\n  Mr. President, I just want to point out that these riders that we \nhave on the Labor-HHS bill can be dropped. For example, this week the \nRepublicans have dropped their effort to attach the Istook antilobbying \nrider to the Treasury-Postal conference agreement, thereby clearing the \nbill for congressional approval.\n  They agreed to a compromise to the abortion rider on the defense \nappropriations conference agreement, also clearing it for approval in \nboth Houses. And they dropped all 17 House-approved EPA riders on the \nHUD-VA conference agreement.\n  So this unanimous-consent request that I propounded--and I also want \nto state, Mr. President, that I had checked with the chairman of the \nAppropriations subcommittee, Senator Specter. I am the ranking member \non that. I used to be chairman and he was ranking member. I checked \nwith him earlier. He is in favor of this unanimous-consent request, and \nI asked if I could have his permission to so state that for the Record, \nand he said yes.\n  Again, Mr. President, I want to point out, on this side of the aisle, \nwe have no objections to bringing up Labor-HHS and simply passing it on \na voice vote if these riders are dropped, just as I pointed out riders \nwere dropped from other bills, clearing them for action.\n  With that I thank the Senator from Mississippi.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/11/17/senate-section/article/S17361-1", "month": "11", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "17", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S17361-S17362]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  PRIVATE SECURITIES LITIGATION REFORM\n\n  Mr. LOTT.

Mr. President, the Coast Guard Authorization Act of 1995 \n(S. 1004) is bipartisan legislation to reauthorize the activities of \nthe U.S. Coast Guard for fiscal year 1996.\n  On March 15, 1995, the Committee on Commerce, Science, and \nTransportation held a hearing to review the administration's request \nfor this bill.\n  Senators Pressler, Hollings, Kerry, and Breaux joined me as \ncosponsors of the legislation, which I introduced in June 1995.\n  The Commerce Committee reported my bill on July 20, 1995 and filed \nits report on October 19, 1995.\n  The manager's amendment I am offering improves on the reported bill \nand adds several new provisions that were requested by the Coast Guard \nor Members of the Senate, or that were included in the House-passed \nCoast Guard bill.\n  Senators Pressler, Hollings, Kerry, Snowe, and Hutchison join me as \ncosponsors of the amendment.\n  The bill authorizes a total of $3.69 billion for the Coast Guard in \nfiscal 1996, including $2.6 million for operations and maintenance, \n$428 million for acquisition and construction, and $582 million for \nretired pay.\n  It authorizes an end-of-year military strength for Coast Guard active \nduty personnel at 38,400 for fiscal year 1996.\n  I cannot emphasize enough how important the Coast Guard is in \nprotecting the lives of Americans along the coasts.\n  On the average day, the Coast Guard will save 14 lives in the United \nStates alone, and assist 328 people.\n  On the average day, the Coast Guard will save $2.5 million in \nproperty, and will seize almost 400 pounds of marijuana and cocaine.\n  On the average day, the Coast Guard will interdict 176 illegal \nimmigrants, and conduct 191 search and rescue missions.\n  In 1 year--in Alaska alone--the Coast Guard will save approximately \n200 lives.\n  I cannot emphasize enough how much the Coast Guard means to Alaskans \nand to Americans who work out on the ocean or use our waterways for \nrecreation.\n  I want like to take this opportunity to thank Admiral Kramek, the \nCommandant of the Coast Guard, and to specifically thank the Commander \nof the 17th District, Admiral Ernest Riutta, and all of the Coast Guard \npersonnel in Alaska for their dedication to the protection of Alaskans.\n  The Coast Guard is an integral part of our coastal communities in \nAlaska, and we are grateful for their presence.\n  I also want to note that 2 days ago the President signed the \nTransportation appropriations bill we passed for the next fiscal year, \nso the Coast Guard was only temporarily affected by the current \ngovernment shutdown.\n  I am offering a separate amendment (cosponsored by Senators Chafee, \nSnowe, and Breaux) to fix a problem in the Oil Pollution Act of 1990 \n[OPA] relating to financial responsibility requirements for offshore \nfacilities.\n  The section of OPA we are fixing is under the jurisdiction of the \nEnvironment and Public Works Committee. My summary contains an \nexplanation of the changes we are making.\n  An amendment Senator Kerry is offering would modify the existing \ncoordinates of an Army Corps of Engineers dredging project in Cohasset \nHarbor.\n  This provision, too, is under the jurisdiction of the Environment and \nPublic Works Committee. \n\n[[Page S 17387]]\n\n  I further request that my summary of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  Before I conclude, I want to thank the Commerce Committee staff who \nhelped us prepare this legislation: Tom Melius, Jim Sartucci, and \nTrevor McCabe on the majority side and Penny Dalton, Lila Helms and \nCarl Bentzel on the minority side.\n  I also want to thank Admiral Kramek and the Coast Guard for their \nhelp with the bill. We've particularly appreciated the assistance of \nCoast Guard Congressional Liaison personnel: Captain Guy Goodwin (Chief \nof Congressional Affairs), Commander John Jaskot (Senate Liaison \nOfficer), and Commander Larry Kiern (Counsel for Congressional \nAffairs).\n  I know of no opposition to the bill or amendments we are offering \ntoday.\n  There being no objection, the summary was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record; as follows:\n\n                           Summary of S. 1004\n\n       The reported bill authorizes appropriations for the Coast \n     Guard in the amount of 3.69 billion dollars for fiscal year \n     1996. It authorizes end of year military strengths for active \n     duty personnel of 38,400 for fiscal year 1996 and authorizes \n     several personnel management improvements requested by the \n     Coast Guard.\n       In the area of marine safety and waterway services \n     management, the bill imposes a new civil penalty for alcohol \n     and dangerous drug testing violations, increases existing \n     civil penalties for documentation, marine casualty reporting, \n     and uninspected vessel manning violations, and enables the \n     Coast Guard to collect foreign passenger vessel inspection \n     user fees.\n       The bill renews several advisory committees that provide \n     the Coast Guard with key private sector input, authorizes the \n     electronic filing of certain vessel commercial instruments, \n     and establishes a new regulatory system for oil spill \n     response vessels. It amends certain document endorsement and \n     towing vessel manning requirements to improve the \n     competitiveness of Great Lakes vessels.\n       The bill improves the management of the Coast Guard \n     Auxiliary, a 36,000 member volunteer organization that \n     provides the Coast Guard with low-cost assistance with its \n     boating safety mission. It defines the status of and provides \n     protection for Auxiliary members while performing official \n     Coast Guard duties. It also improves their ability to \n     cooperate with State authorities and obtain excess Coast \n     Guard resources.\n       The bill improves recreational boating safety by \n     restructuring the process for providing states with \n     recreational boating safety grants, stimulating non-\n     trailerable vessel facility construction, requiring young \n     children to wear a Coast Guard approved personal flotation \n     device under certain circumstances, and requiring a plan to \n     increase the reporting of vessel accidents.\n       A key provision of the bill reduces the regulatory burden \n     on U.S. commercial vessel operators by shifting away from \n     excessive U.S. vessel standards towards accepted \n     international standards. This title also authorizes the use \n     of third party and self inspection programs as alternatives \n     to Coast Guard inspections and extends U.S. vessel inspection \n     intervals. These changes are supported by the Coast Guard, \n     and will enable Coast Guard inspectors to focus more on the \n     problem of substandard foreign vessels calling on U.S. ports. \n     The bill also includes numerous technical changes to \n     authorize the establishment of alternate international vessel \n     measurement system requirements for existing statutes that \n     contain U.S. vessel measurement thresholds. These alternate \n     tonnages will enable U.S. vessel designers and operators to \n     be competitive in the international vessel market.\n       The bill strengthens statutes intended to reduce pollution \n     from ships, establishes a Marine Debris Coordinating \n     Committee to improve the effectiveness of marine pollution \n     statutes, and continues and improves an existing pollution \n     prevention public outreach program.\n       The bill includes a number of provisions to strengthen the \n     Coast Guard's authority to combat drug smuggling by sea and \n     air, and to protect Coast Guard personnel during boardings at \n     sea.\n       The bill provides for the conveyances of several pieces of \n     Coast Guard property which the Coast Guard no longer needs, \n     as well as several miscellaneous provisions.\n\n\n                      Summary of Stevens Amendment\n\n       The amendment makes a number of technical corrections to \n     the bill. Among its substantive provisions, the amendment: \n     (1) enhances the federal government's ability to collect \n     fines and penalties from owners and operators of foreign \n     vessels that call on U.S. ports; (2) authorizes the \n     conveyance of unneeded National Defense Reserve Fleet \n     equipment to museum ships; (3) provides new authority for the \n     Coast Guard, similar to the authority that has been included \n     in the Defense authorization bill for other branches, to \n     obtain family housing units, unaccompanied housing units and \n     support facilities; (4) authorizes the Coast Guard to \n     exchange its dock and facilities in downtown Juneau, Alaska \n     for other property it determines suitable; (5) establishes a \n     nonjudicial alternative to Federal court action for marine \n     lenders in cases of vessel defaults; (6) authorizes the use \n     of Canadian oil spill response and recovery vessels in the \n     U.S. waters adjacent to Canada at the Maine border in \n     emergencies when no suitable U.S. vessels are available; (7) \n     facilitates the sale by courts of recreational vessels to \n     non-U.S. citizens; (8) improves the Coast Guard's authority \n     to sell recyclable material; (9) authorizes waivers to the \n     Jones Act for several vessels; and (10) authorizes an \n     experimental vessel inspection program in the State of \n     Minnesota.\n       The amendment also makes certain changes to section 1113 of \n     the reported bill to ensure that the section is not used to \n     circumvent U.S. coastwise laws. The purpose of the section is \n     to eliminate technical impediments to certain financing \n     techniques for vessels in the domestic trade.\n       Section 1113 adds a new subsection (``(e)'') to section \n     12106 of title 46, United States Code, to permit coastwise \n     endorsements for vessels owned by non-U.S. citizens where: 1) \n     the owner is primarily engaged in the financing of the \n     vessel; and 2) where the owner has transferred, through a \n     bona fide demise charter of at least three years, full \n     possession, control and command of the vessel to a person \n     qualifying as a citizen of the United States, so that the \n     demise charterer is considered the owner pro hac vice during \n     the charter term. The amendment ensures that the demise \n     charter is bona fide by requiring a certification that no \n     other agreements, arrangements or understandings (other than \n     the demise charter) exist between the owner and charterer, \n     and a requirement that the charter hire not be significantly \n     greater than that prevailing in the commercial market. The \n     latter requirement is intended to ensure that the ``owner'' \n     under the demise charter is a bona fide lessor.\n       The Secretary of Transportation establish the necessary \n     regulations to administer the new subsection, including \n     providing for the filing of demise charters and amendments to \n     such demise charters for vessels issued coastwise \n     endorsements under the new subsection, as part of the vessel \n     documentation procedures administered by the Coast Guard, or \n     its successor. Provisions will also be made so that \n     interested persons can register their concerns with respect \n     to any lease finance transaction which may not be bona fide. \n     Section 1113 prohibits vessels which receive documentation or \n     a coastwise endorsement under the new subsection 12106(e) \n     from receiving a fishery endorsement under section 12108 of \n     title 46, United States Code.\n\n\n                  Summary of Stevens/Chafee Amendment\n\n       Section 1016 of the Oil Pollution Act of 1990 (OPA) \n     requires a ``responsible party with respect to an offshore \n     facility'' to ``establish and maintain evidence of financial \n     responsibility in the amount of $150,000,000.'' ``Offshore \n     facility'' is defined in OPA as ``any facility of any kind \n     located in, on, or under the navigable waters of the United \n     States,'' and ``facility'' under OPA is defined to include \n     even motor vehicles. Further, the definition of ``navigable \n     waters'' under the Clean Water Act is quite broad, \n     encompassing wetlands and other areas. The Minerals \n     Management Service (MMS) has concluded that it cannot issue \n     regulations for this section of OPA because the $150 million \n     financial responsibility requirement would apply too broadly, \n     and the statute does not provide the agency with flexibility.\n       The amendment limits the application of the financial \n     responsibility requirement to responsible parties with \n     respect to offshore facilities that are: 1) seaward of the \n     line of ordinary low water (i.e. seaward of the line of low \n     tide and actually in the ocean, including inland bays and \n     estuaries); 2) used for exploring for, drilling for, or \n     producing oil, or for transporting oil from facilities \n     engaged in exploration, drilling, or production; and 3) that \n     have a worst case discharge potential of 1,000 barrels of oil \n     or more. This narrows the broad meaning of section 1016 to \n     include only the offshore facilities Congress intended in \n     1990. The President would have the discretionary authority to \n     require evidence of financial responsibility for offshore \n     facilities with a worst case discharge of less than 1,000 \n     barrels if the facility poses risks necessary to justify such \n     evidence.\n       In addition, the language lowers the amount of financial \n     responsibility for responsible parties with respect to \n     offshore facilities from $150 million down to $35 million for \n     facilities outside of three miles, and to $10 million for \n     facilities inside the State three-mile limits. The provision \n     allows the President to increase the amount (back up to $150 \n     million) if the facility is determined to pose a risk \n     requiring a higher amount, based on a risk assessment of a \n     number of variables. If a State has financial responsibility \n     requirements that are equal to or greater than the federal \n     requirements, the federal requirements will not apply. This \n     will help to eliminate duplicative reporting requirements for \n     responsible parties in demonstrating evidence of financial \n     responsibility for offshore facilities.\n       The amendment eliminates the problem under OPA as passed \n     which would require even small and low-risk offshore \n     facilities to have evidence of $150 million in oil spill \n     liability coverage. The amendment will further prevent \n     responsible parties with respect to marinas and other \n     facilities which are not involved in exploration, drilling or \n     the production of oil from having to satisfy financial \n     responsibility requirements intended to apply to traditional \n     offshore facilities engaged in these activities. Nothing in \n     the provision affects the liability of responsible parties \n     for oil spills under OPA, just the amount \n\n[[Page S 17388]]\n     of financial responsibility they must show with respect to offshore \n     facilities.\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Mr. President, I am pleased that today the Senate is \nconsidering S. 1004, the Coast Guard Authorization Act of 1995, along \nwith a manager's amendment to the bill.\n  The Coast Guard has broad ranging responsibilities--from enforcing \nAmerica's maritime laws to ensuring the safety of recreational boaters.\n  Like other Federal agencies, the Coast Guard faces the challenge of \ncontinuing to provide better government at less cost. It is clear the \nAmerican taxpayers are demanding a smaller, more accountable federal \ngovernment. At the same time, the demand for certain government \nservices, including those provided by the Coast Guard, continues to be \ngreat. The Commandant of the Coast Guard, Adm. Robert E. Kramek, \nrecently announced his national plan for streamlining the Coast Guard, \nwhich will save, on a cumulative basis, nearly $1 billion by the year \n2005 and make available over $1 billion in property for other uses. \nDespite cuts of this magnitude, the Coast Guard will continue to \nperform all its current missions. I am pleased the Coast Guard is \nmaking a serious effort to improve it's efficiency while maintaining \nits effectiveness.\n  The bill before us authorizes appropriations for the Coast Guard for \nfiscal year 1996 and authorizes several management improvements \nrequested by the Coast Guard. Many members on both sides of the aisle \nhave expressed interest in this bill and we have addressed their \nrequests as best we could. The bill and amendment have broad bipartisan \nsupport.\n  Mr. President, I would now like to make special mention of certain \nportions of the bill and amendment.\n  The bill improves the management of the Coast Guard Auxiliary, a \n36,000 member volunteer organization that provides the Coast Guard with \nlow-cost assistance with its boating safety mission. The bill also \nimproves recreational boating safety by restructuring the process for \nproviding States with recreational boating safety grants and \nstimulating nontrailerable vessel facility construction. These \nprovisions will help ensure the safety of recreational boaters \nthroughout the Nation, including places like Lewis and Clark Lake in my \nhome State of South Dakota.\n  Mr. President, I believe the Coast Guard is up to the challenge of \nmaintaining its status as the world's premier maritime organization \ndespite the intense budget pressure. It is my belief this authorization \nbill provides the Coast Guard with the support it needs to meet that \nchallenge.\n  Let me take this opportunity to thank the very capable Senator \nStevens, who is Chairman of our Oceans and Fisheries Subcommittee, for \nhis leadership in developing this bill and amendment.\n  I would also like to recognize Senator Hollings, the ranking \nDemocratic member on the full committee for his bipartisanship \nthroughout this process.\n  And finally, I wish to thank my colleagues for their contributions \nand support and I urge the adoption of the manager's amendment and \npassage of S. 1004.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, in recent weeks there have been numerous \nbattles on the Senate floor over efforts to take a budgetary meat ax to \nthe Federal Government, eliminating agencies and slashing funding. \nToday, I am pleased to join with my Commerce Committee colleagues in \nsupporting legislation to authorize the activities of one Federal \nagency, the U.S. Coast Guard, which has been spared by the budget \nhackers. The reason for this success is simple--there is bipartisan \nrecognition that the Coast Guard has an important job and does it well. \nIndeed, the widespread support for the Coast Guard budget reflects the \nbreadth and complexity of its missions--from protecting our maritime \nboundaries and the safety of life at sea to preserving the ocean \nenvironment and enforcing maritime laws and treaties. On an average day \nin 1994, the Coast Guard saved 14 lives, assisted 328 people, responded \nto 34 oil or hazardous chemical spills, inspected 64 commercial \nvessels, seized 379 pounds of illegal drugs, serviced 150 aids to \nnavigation, and interdicted 174 illegal aliens.\n  Over the years, we have continued to ask the Coast Guard to do more \nwith less. In typical fashion, the Coast Guard has responded with a \nstreamlining plan that will trim $400 million from the budget by 1998 \nand allow personnel reductions of 4,000 people. As an example of the \npragmatic approach the Coast Guard has taken in this plan, next summer \nwe will welcome the Coast Guard high endurance cutters, Dallas and \nGallatin, to their new homeport at the Charleston Navy Base. By \nrelocating Coast Guard assets from expensive locales like Governors \nIsland to areas where the quality of life is high and the cost of \nliving is reasonable, everyone benefits. Coast Guard is better able to \nmeet both its budgetary bottom line and its personnel needs.\n  Today, the Senate is considering S. 1004, the Coast Guard \nAuthorization Act of 1995. The bill authorizes a Coast Guard budget of \n$3.7 billion in fiscal year 1996, covering six appropriations accounts: \nFirst, operating expenses; second, acquisition, construction, and \nimprovement of equipment and facilities; third, research and \ndevelopment; fourth, retired pay; fifth, alteration and removal of \nbridges; and sixth, environmental compliance and restoration. The \nauthorization levels are consistent with the administration's budget \nrequest for fiscal year 1996.\n  S. 1004 also provides for end-of-year military strength and training \nloads and addresses a backlog of Coast Guard-related administrative and \npolicy issues. Among such issues, the bill provides for: Personnel \nadministrative reforms requested by the administration, marine safety \nand waterways management improvements, updated authority for the Coast \nGuard Auxiliary, funding for State recreational boating safety grants, \nregulatory reforms for the U.S. maritime industry, tougher controls to \nreduce marine plastic pollution, and law enforcement enhancements to \nreduce drug smuggling and money laundering. At this point, I would like \nto highlight some key provisions of the legislation.\n\n\n                         alteration of bridges\n\n  Under the Truman-Hobbs Bridge Act, the Federal Government shares with \nthe States the cost of altering publicly owned bridges that obstruct \nthe free movement of marine traffic. The administration requested no \nfunding for this account in fiscal year 1995, initiating a new policy \nunder which the Coast Guard no longer will seek direct funding for \nalteration of highway bridges. Instead, the administration proposes \nthat the Federal share of such projects be financed from the \ndiscretionary bridge program funds of the Federal Highway \nAdministration, under the continuing program direction of the Coast \nGuard. This new policy would not apply to railroad bridges. S. 1004 \nprovides the Secretary of Transportation--Secretary--with the \ndiscretionary authority to implement the administration policy.\n\n\n                          Boat Safety Account\n\n  Similar to legislation approved by the committee last Congress, S. \n1004 would ensure that States receive financial assistance for the \ndevelopment and implementation of a coordinated national recreational \nboating safety program. The State grants are not funded from general \nrevenues, but rather from motorboat fuel tax revenues that are \ndeposited in the Boat Safety Account of the Aquatic Resources Trust \nFund--Wallop-Breaux Fund. The Wallop-Breaux Fund also supports State \ngrant programs administered by the Department of the Interior [DOI]. \nUnlike the DOI programs, however, the Coast Guard grant program is \nscored against agency operating expenses and competes directly with \nother Coast Guard missions for funding priority. S. 1004 would continue \nState boating safety grants and allow the budget scoring to be \npatterned after DOI programs under the Wallop-Breaux fund by increasing \nthe funding available under the Clean Vessel Act of 1992. Under the \nbill, authorized funding for State boating programs would increase from \n$45 million in fiscal year 1995 to $59 million by fiscal year 1999. S. \n1004 also would improve recreational boating safety by requiring \nchildren age 6 and younger to wear lifejackets and calling for plans to \nbe developed to improve reporting of vessel accidents.\n\n\n                     coast guard regulatory reform.\n\n  Last year, Coast Guard worked with the maritime industry in \ndeveloping a package of amendments to existing marine safety laws that \nwould allow their implementation in a more cost-\n\n[[Page S 17389]]\neffective and efficient manner, reduce the regulatory burden on the \nindustry, and provide greater flexibility in making safety decisions. \nThe amendments contained in the bill before us today specifically \nwould: Implement the International Safety Management Code for U.S. \nvessels engaged in foreign commerce; allow qualified third parties such \nas the American Bureau of Shipping to conduct vessel safety \ninspections; allow greater use of foreign manufactured safety \nequipment; and extend the validity of Coast Guard certificates of \ninspection from 2 to 5 years, allowing earlier scheduling of annual \ninspections. The changes will help U.S.-flag vessels to become more \ncompetitive in international trade and reflect the Cost Guard's \ncommitment to harmonize U.S. regulations with international \nrequirements.\n\n\n                         population from ships\n\n  S. 1004 also includes a provision developed in cooperation with \nSenator Lautenberg that would amend the act to prevent pollution from \nships [APPS] to strengthen requirements that ports maintain reception \nfacilities to off load plastic wastes generated by vessels at sea. The \nbill calls for the Secretary to inspect and maintain a list of such \nfacilities and for port operators to post placards encouraging \nreporting of any inadequacies. S. 1004 also amends the Marine Plastic \nPollution Research and Control Act to: Continue the Secretary's \nbiannual reporting to Congress on compliance with APPS; add a \nrequirement to publish an annual list of APPS violators; establish a \nMarine Debris Coordinating Committee; and continue and expand the \nFederal Public Outreach Program to include the use of grants.\n\n\n                      law enforcement enhancement\n\n  In 1970, Secretary of the Treasury Alexander Hamilton ordered the \nconstruction of revenue cutters to stop smuggling and enforce tariffs. \nToday, the Coast Guard continues that mission, facing and increasingly \nsophisticated threat from illegal drug smugglers. Proving new authority \nto deal with an old problem, S. 1004 contains administration-requested \nmeasures to enhance law enforcement. These measures establish \nsanctions--including seizure and forefeiture--for failure to land an \naircraft at the order of a Federal officer enforcing drug or money-\nlaundering laws, and for obstructing boarding of a vessel by a Federal \nlaw enforcement officer. These measurers provide for Federal Aviation \nAdministration [FAA] revocation of aircraft or airman certificates for \nsuch a violation, establish Coast Guard and Customs Service air \ninterdiction authority, and set civil penalties of $15,000 for \nviolations of that authority. In addition, the managers' amendment \nwould revise these provisions to require that FAA establish conditions, \nbased on observed conduct or prior information, for ordering a plan to \nland. These provisions are not intended to restrict or affect in any \nway the Federal Government's current broad authority to conduct boarder \nsearches. I am optimistic that the bill strikes an appropriate balance \nwith the need to assure innocent citizens that they will not be forced \nto land.\n\n\n                        cruise ship tort reform\n\n  Before closing, Mr. President, there is one matter I would like to \naddress regarding the House-passed Coast Guard authorization bill. The \nHouse bill, H.R. 1361, contains tort reform proposals regarding foreign \ncruiseline companies. The provisions, which I strongly oppose, would \nalter U.S. tort law in three significant areas: First, medical \nmalpractice claims by passengers on U.S. cruiselines; second, emotional \ndistress claims by U.S. passengers; and third, physical injury suits by \nforeign cruise ship employees.\n  First, in medical malpractice suits against foreign cruise shiplines \nbrought by American passengers, the legislation would permit the \ncruiselines arbitrarily to select the State law that governs the \naction. This right of selection would apply regardless of the State \nwhere the plaintiff resides, or where the suit is brought. The \nlegislation would, for the first time under American tort law, permit \nthe law of one State to govern actions in another State, merely at the \nself-interested discretion of foreign companies.\n\n  Second, with respect to limitations on pain and suffering damages, \nthe legislation would allow foreign companies to use the fine print of \nticket sales to absolve themselves of liability for pain and suffering \ndamages. Foreign cruiselines would be permitted to limit their \nliability for such damages to cases involving substantial physical \ninjury. The legislation would allow the companies to use the fine print \non tickets to determine what constitutes a substantial physical injury. \nThis is unfair, particularly considering that most passengers often are \nunaware of such limitations when purchasing tickets.\n  Third, the House-passed bill would ban suits in U.S. courts by \nforeign cruise ship workers for injuries or death, if the employee \npurportedly is part of a collective-bargaining agreement providing for \na dispute forum, or redress is available in their home countries. The \nprovision would be applicable even if there is evidence that such \ncruiselines substantially use U.S. ports and resources or transport \nU.S. passengers. I am concerned that this provision will permit foreign \ncruiselines to exploit foreign employees, who often have no adequate \nredress available in their country of origin. The provision also will \nencourage the hiring of foreign workers as cheap and exploitable labor, \nat the expense of U.S. workers.\n  Mr. President, I am pleased that the bill we are considering today \ndoes not include these questionable provisions. They have not had the \nbenefit of hearings or other close scrutiny by the Senate Commerce \nCommittee and are inappropriate for inclusion within a bill to \nauthorize appropriations for the U.S. Coast Guard.\n  Over the past two centuries, the U.S. Coast Guard has built an \nenduring reputation throughout the world for its maritime safety, \nenvironmental protection, humanitarian, and lifesaving efforts. We have \nall watched the valiant and often heroic work of Coast Guard seamen and \nofficers as they rescue desperate refugees who have taken to the seas \nin crowded and makeshift boats. Even in the remote regions of the \nworld, the Coast Guard is present, actively engaged in the enforcement \nof United Nations' embargoes against countries like the former Republic \nof Yugoslavia and Iraq. The men and women of the Coast Guard respond \nwith equal dedication during times of war and peace. I ask my \ncolleagues to recognize this service by joining me in supporting S. \n1004.\n  Mr. KERRY: Mr. President, I am pleased to join my distinguished \ncolleagues, Senators Stevens, Hollings, Pressler, and Breaux in \ncosponsoring the bill before us today to authorize the programs and \nactivities of the U.S. Coast Guard for fiscal year 1996.\n  In this time of draconian budget cuts and dramatic changes in our \nsociety and our Government, it is unusual to find an agency which \neveryone agrees is a good investment. But that is true of the U.S. \nCoast Guard.\n  Mr. President, Massachusetts with its hundreds of miles of coastline, \nunforgiving storms, active maritime and fishing industries, and \nthriving recreational boating population, needs the Coast Guard at full \nstrength. So does the rest of the nation.\n  The Coast Guard is essential to the safety and well-being of citizens \nin every coastal State and in every State with navigable waters. Today, \nover 50 percent of the U.S. population lives within coastal areas and \ndirectly benefits from the services the Coast Guard provides.\n  But, indirectly, the Coast Guard, in the performance of its mission, \nprotects every American. In fact, more than two-thirds of the total \nbudget for the Coast Guard goes to operating expenses to protect public \nsafety and the marine environment, to enforce fishery and other laws \nand treaties, maintain aids to navigation, prevent illegal drug \ntrafficking and illegal immigration, and preserve defense readiness.\n  The Coast Guard is the oldest continuous seagoing service. As a \nmilitary service it has fought in almost every war since the \nConstitution became the law of the land in 1789, and it has performed \nits myriad of peacetime missions during the intervening years. It has \nproven that it is a multi-mission service flexible enough to adjust to \nthe needs of the nation in peacetime as well as wartime.\n  Since its origins as the Revenue Cutter Service, enforcing tariff \nlaws of the young nation for Treasury Secretary Alexander Hamilton the \nCoast Guard has expanded its missions to include saving lives, \nenforcing U.S. laws and treaties, ensuring maritime safety and \n\n[[Page S 17390]]\ndefense, maintaining safe navigation and protecting the environment. \nGiven this legacy of service and the degree to which Americans depend \non it for their vital services, I believe it is our responsibility to \nensure that the Coast Guard has adequate resources for its missions as \nit prepares for the next century. Our actions should ensure that the \nCoast Guard is capable of meeting its existing mandates and recognize \nthe Coast Guard's ever-expanding role and missions in our coastal \nwaters and beyond.\n  The Commonwealth of Massachusetts has a long and storied involvement \nwith the sea and the Coast Guard. One of Alexander Hamilton's ten \noriginal revenue cutters was built in the City of Newburyport and was \nnamed the Massachusetts. The successors of the Massachusetts--today's \nCoast Guard cutters--are stationed in the ports of Boston, Gloucester, \nWoods Hole and New Bedford. The first lighthouse built in the United \nStates was Boston Light in 1716. Today, Boston Light stands as the only \nmanned lighthouse still in operation in the United States. The people \nof Massachusetts love the ocean. Over 145,000 recreational boats are \nregistered in Massachusetts. Many rely on the sea for their livelihood. \nThe men and women of the Coast Guard keep watch over the fishing \nfleets, the maritime industry, and recreational boaters. While \nMassachusetts has a long and close relationship with the Coast Guard, \nmany other States can demonstrate similar ties.\n  We all know that the Coast Guard's mission does not end at our shore. \nIt protects our interests throughout the world in times of war and \npeace. From supporting U.S. peacekeepers in Haiti, to responding to oil \nspills in the Persian Gulf, to supporting drug interdiction efforts in \nSouth and Central America the Coast Guard has been there.\n  Its work has been exemplary, but it seems that we continually ask the \nCoast Guard to do more with less and have been doing this for a long \ntime. The Coast Guard is now in the process of a 4-year downsizing and \nstreamlining which ultimately will reduce the service by 4,000 people \nand $400 million--a 12 percent reduction. We must eventually \nacknowledge the finite limitations on Coast Guard capabilities and \nresources and I am concerned about some of the choices it will be \nforced to make.\n  The bill before us today assists the Coast Guard in facing these \ndilemmas, allowing it to do its job more effectively and efficiently. \nI'll describe some of the ways it will do this.\n  The bill includes provisions that would ensure continued funding for \nstate boating safety grants by changing the funding mechanisms--\nexpanding the existing boating safety grant program that was \nestablished by the Clean Vessel Act of 1992 and ensuring access to \nfunds from the Boat Safety Account of the Aquatic Resources Trust Fund, \nor the Wallop Breaux fund as it is known.\n  Long awaited by the maritime industry, the Coast Guard regulatory \nreform provisions of the bill will eliminate unnecessary and burdensome \nregulations on American shipping companies in order to make them more \ncompetitive in the world market. These reforms will save precious \nresources while also removing an unnecessary burden from a struggling \nindustry.\n  The bill enhances protection of the ocean and coastal environment by \namending the act to prevent pollution from ships, strengthening Coast \nGuard capability to enforce regulations to minimize pollution from \nplastics. It includes provisions to ensure that adequate waste \nreception facilities for plastics are available at ports and terminals \nand to encourage development and implementation of public education \nprograms about the harm of plastics in the environment.\n  To increase the weapons in our arsenal for the war on drugs, the bill \nadds new authority for federal law enforcement officials by providing \nsanctions for aircraft and vessel operators suspected of smuggling \ndrugs or laundering money, who intentionally disobey the orders of a \nFederal law enforcement officer to land or halt their aircraft or \nvessel. These operators will face criminal and civil penalties of \nimprisonment of up to a year, fines up to $15,000, seizure of the \naircraft or vessel and forfeiture of the aircraft's registration.\n  The bill instructs the Coast Guard to develop a plan for making the \ntransition from the current ground-based radionavigation system [LORAN-\nC] to a satellite-based technology--global positioning system or GPS--\nafter it is determined that GPS is ready to serve as the sole means of \nsafe and efficient navigation. The plan must take into consideration \nthe need to ensure that LORAN-C technology purchased by the public \nbefore the year 2000 has a useful economic life.\n  As part of the response to the Exxon Valdez oil spill, the Oil \nPollution Act of 1990 (or OPA 90), required that offshore facilities \ndemonstrate the ability to pay certain costs of oil cleanup and damages \nup to $150 million that could result from an oil spill. The Minerals \nManagement Service of the Department of the Interior recently \ndetermined that the present language of the law extends the financial \nresponsibility requirement over an unnecessarily large group of \nfacilities that includes traditional inshore facilities such as marinas \nand oil terminals, some of which may be located far inland. There \nappears to be consensus that the intent of the law was to require \ndemonstration of financial responsibility for offshore drilling rigs \nand production platforms, not inshore facilities. Applying these same \nfinancial requirements to the thousands of inshore facilities in \nMassachusetts and throughout the country which pose a much smaller oil \nspill risk, would impose potentially severe financial burdens. \nTherefore, amendment to the bill will be offered to clarify the \nstatutory requirements for financial responsibility as they apply to \nfacilities traditionally located in inshore areas and facilities \ntraditionally located in offshore areas. The bill also amends the \nfinancial responsibility requirements so that responsibility is \nproportional to the oil spill risk posed by the facility. Although I \ngenerally do not support letting potential oil polluters off the hook \nfinancially, these provisions allow us to maintain protection of the \nmarine environment and prevent requiring unreasonable levels of \nfinancial responsibility requirements for facilities that do not pose a \nsubstantial risk of a oil spill risk.\n  I would also like to mention another and highly controversial \nprovision relating to OPA that is contained in the House-passed Coast \nGuard authorization bill but which has been omitted--properly--from the \nSenate bill. The House provision would eliminate ``direct action'' \nauthority which has been in U.S. law since 1970 relating to clean-ups \nand damage claims from oil spills. ``Direct action'' entitles a \nclaimant to proceed directly against the responsible party's financial \nresponsibility provider, usually an insurer, in order to obtain \ncompensation for loss associated with a pollution incident.\n  Direct action enhances prompt payment by a spiller by assuring that \ngovernments and other claimants do not get caught in the middle of \narguments concerning reasons why insurers do not have to pay those they \ninsure. Direct action in connection with oil spill liability is not an \nOPA creation. Direct action is a key component of the ``polluter pays'' \nmandate of Congress which makes potential spillers act more responsibly \nand has been an underpinning of oil pollution financial responsibility \nlaws, both national and international, for 25 years.\n  The oil industry has voiced a concern that no insurer will provide \ninsurance guarantees under the OPA regime, with its direct action \ncomponent. Apparently some insurers fear they will be exposed to \nunlimited liability because the courts will circumvent OPA's explicit \nprovisions limiting a guarantor's liability. I believe this fear is \nwithout practical basis, however, because insurers currently provide \ndirect action guarantees for facilities located on the outer \ncontinental shelf under a regime that is almost identical to that \nestablished under OPA. Furthermore, I am deeply concerned about the \nprecedent that rolling back the direct action provisions applying to \noffshore facilities will have. I believe that these provisions would \nundermine an important tenet in marine environmental protection, and I \ntherefore strongly oppose their inclusion in the final legislation.\n  Given the fiscal constraints being imposed on the Coast Guard as the \nCongress moves to balance the federal \n\n[[Page S 17391]]\nbudget, the service's efforts to downsize and streamline have \nbeen demonstrated admirable seriousness. In general, I support the \nCoast Guard's goals of streamlining and consolidating operations where \npossible. I applaud its recently announced plans to streamline without \nclosing or consolidating any frontline operating units while reducing \npersonnel slots by 1,000 and overhead expenses by $100 million. \nHowever, I am very concerned by the administration's budget proposal to \nclose 23 Coast Guard small boat stations as a cost-cutting effort to \nsave $6 million.\n\n  I have looked closely at the criteria used by the Coast Guard to \ndevelop the closure and station modification lists and was surprised to \nfind absent from the criteria any consideration of local and regional \nfactors, including water temperature and unusual tidal or current \nconditions. The Coast Guard uses a one size fits all approach to \ndetermining response time for their small boat stations. I do not \nbelieve this is appropriate because severe weather and ocean patterns \nin some regions can slow down the average response time and colder \nwater temperatures necessitate a quicker response to prevent death and \nserious physical injury.\n  Alexander Hamilton, the Secretary of the Treasury and Coast Guard \nfounding father, was the first to acknowledge such differences when he \nallowed additional funding in 1789 for the construction of two larger \nrevenue cutters in order to handle the harsh winters off the New \nEngland coast. These conditions have not changed and still require that \nspecial local and regional needs be addressed in any Coast Guard \ndecision process. This is not a parochial Massachusetts issue. Similar \nconditions exist in throughout the country--in the Great Lakes and the \nNorthwest Pacific.\n  The Coast Guard criteria also appear to exclude consideration of \nvital Coast Guard missions besides search and rescue--including marine \nenvironmental protection, boating safety, and enforcement of drug, \nillegal alien, and fisheries laws. In the consideration of whether or \nnot to close a station, I believe all the services provided by the \nstation should be taken into account.\n  When, after consideration, the Coast Guard concludes a station should \nbe closed, it must take steps to ensure that necessary services will \ncontinue to be available in the station's area.\n  The provisions in the bill establish a more detailed and public \nprocess that addresses these issues and those voiced by the Senate \nAppropriations Subcommittee on Transportation and Infrastructure and \nset forth in the conference report on the Transportation appropriations \nbill.\n  The conference committee in resolving the differences between the \nHouse and Senate versions of the Transportation appropriations bill \nvoted to preclude the Coast Guard from closing any small boat stations \nduring Fiscal year 1996. The authorization bill incorporates the \nappropriators' prohibition against closure of any small boat stations \nin fiscal year 1996 and sets forth more detailed criteria for making \nsuch decisions in subsequent years. Such criteria would include unique \nweather conditions as I have noted, a station's deterrent effect on \ncrime, and its role in protecting life, property, the environment, \npublic safety or national security. Coastal communities most impacted \nby the closure of a station will be able to submit comments on their \nconcerns before that final decision is made.\n  While we take these steps to increase the probability that \nsignificant damage will not result from station closures, I realize \nthat the process may make station closures more cumbersome, \nconsequently, the bill allows the Secretary of Transportation to \nimplement management efficiencies within the small boat system, such as \nmodifying the operational posture of units or reallocating resources as \nnecessary to ensure the safety of the maritime public nationwide.\n  I believe that this provision gives the Coast Guard the flexibility \nto make the operational changes needed to make for streamlining \nservices but ensures that coastal communities and the environment are \nnot put at undue risk by closing of a station.\n  In closing, I also want to express my concerns about three highly \ncontroversial provisions relating to foreign cruise ship liability that \nare contained in the House version of the Coast Guard authorization \nbill. No hearings have been held in either house on this matter, and \nthe issue of the liability of foreign-flag cruise vessels is not \ngermane to the legislation before us. I am pleased none of these \nprovisions has been included in the Senate bill.\n  The House provisions in question appear solely to benefit the \nforeign-flag cruise line industry. If enacted, they would jeopardize \nthe health and safety of American passengers traveling on foreign \ncruise ships, and would deal a tremendous blow to the economic well-\nbeing of American workers and American businesses which are in \ncompetition for American tourist dollars with the foreign-flag cruise \nline industry.\n  The first provision would allow foreign cruise ship owners to use the \nfine print on the back of tickets to deny liability for emotional \ndistress claims brought by passengers, unless the passengers also \nsuffered substantial physical injuries. A number of women's groups and \norganizations across the country, including the Women's Legal Defense \nFund, the Women's Law Center, and the NOW Legal Defense Fund, have \nexpressed strong opposition to this provision. They are rightfully \nconcerned that it could make it more difficult for victims of rape on \nforeign-flag cruise vessels, who suffer tremendous emotional scars but \nsometimes only minor physical injuries, to bring civil lawsuits against \nthe cruise lines that bear responsibility for their trauma. I am in \nagreement with their concern and would strongly oppose inclusion of \nthis provision as drafted by the House in the final bill.\n\n  The second provision would allow foreign cruise vessel owners to take \nadvantage of any statutory limitation on liability for medical \nmalpractice available to any doctor or medical facility wherever a \nforeign cruise ship passenger is taken ashore for treatment. This \nlanguage should send chills through anyone who is thinking about taking \na cruise. A very broad measure, it all but sets the stage for U.S. \ncitizens to lose their right to sue for medical malpractice if they are \ntaken for medical treatment to a remote foreign island where doctors or \nhospitals are not held accountable for malpractice. I would not want to \nplace U.S. citizens in such jeopardy.\n  Finally, the most egregious provision relates to foreign seamen's \nrights. This provision would undermine the competitiveness of U.S. \nmaritime labor and further disadvantage U.S. businesses that compete \nwith the foreign-flag cruise line industry. It would overturn centuries \nof maritime law by taking away the basic right of seamen--without \nregard to nationality--to maintain cases against their cruise line \nemployers in U.S. courts for wages and necessary medical care, so long \nas current ``long-arm'' jurisdiction exists. The U.S. Supreme Court, as \nwell as our treaties with foreign nations, have long provided that such \nsuits are proper if there exists a sufficient ``nexus'' with this \ncountry, and that such suits are necessary to maintain a competitive \nbalance between foreign and U.S. labor, because U.S. seamen have such \nrights. Foreign interests should not be granted a special ``exception'' \nfrom the established long-arm jurisdiction of the U.S. justice system, \nnor should we be granting foreign-flag vessels additional economic \nadvantage over the interests of American workers and businesses. \nAmerican maritime labor is certainly justified in its strong opposition \nto this provision.\n  Mr. President, these provisions would directly benefit the narrow \ninterests of foreign cruise line owners while threatening the health \nand safety of American passengers. They have no place in the Coast \nGuard authorization legislation, and I will strongly oppose their \ninclusion in the final legislation.\n  This bill is the culmination of almost two years of effort, and I \nwould like to thank the Chairman of the Subcommittee, Senator Stevens, \nthe Chairman of the Commerce Committee, Senator Pressler, and the \nCommittee's ranking Democrat, Senator Hollings for their hard work in \npreparing this bipartisan bill and bringing it to the floor.\n  I also would like to acknowledge the hard work and long hours \ninvested by staff on both sides, including Penny Dalton and Lila Helms \non the Commerce Committee minority staff and on the majority side, Tom \nMelius, Trevor McCabe, and Jim Sartucci. I \n\n[[Page S 17392]]\nwould like to acknowledge the work of Kate English and Carole Grunberg \nof my staff and Steve Metruck, a congressional fellow in my office. I \nurge my colleagues to support this bill.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the Coast \nGuard authorization bill. The Coast Guard plays a critical role in \nprotecting lives, property and the environment, and it deserves the \nstrong support and admiration of this Congress.\n  In addition to funding the mission of the Coast Guard, Mr. President, \nthis bill will help keep plastics and other garbage off our beaches by \nimproving implementation of the 1987 Marine Plastic Pollution Research \nand Control Act. I have been pursuing these improvements for the last 3 \nyears and it is gratifying to see those efforts come to fruition in \nthis bill.\n  Mr. President, our marine waters are an essential national resource. \nThey perform important ecological functions by providing habitat, \nnursery grounds and a source for a great diversity of plants, and fish, \nbirds and other species. The resources in these waters support \ncommercial and recreational fishing, tourism, recreation, and related \nopportunities. They result in annual expenditures of tens of billions \nof dollars and unquantifiable enjoyment for our citizens.\n  In New Jersey, the lure of the Shore is a major element of the \nState's $18 billion tourism sector, our second largest revenue-\nproducing industry. In 1991, 8.8 million people stayed overnight at the \nShore and an additional 59 million made day trips to New Jersey's \nbeaches. Furthermore, 353,000 people serviced these visitors in some \ncapacity, making the tourism industry the number one employer in the \nState.\n  Mr. President, this critical industry is jeopardized every time a \nperson visits the beach and finds it littered with bottles, cans and \nother garbage. And so it is essential that our beaches are kept free \nfrom waste. I have participated in nationally sponsored beach cleanup \nevents in New Jersey, and with other volunteers, have collected the \ntrash that washes up on our shores.\n  Mr. President, during their 1991 beach cleanup, the Center for Marine \nConservation found nearly 90,000 pieces of plastic rope, 40,000 plastic \ntrash bags, 33,000 plastic gallon jugs, and many other plastic items \nwhich originate aboard commercial vessels. There is likely to be far \nmore ship-generated waste that is not documented because it is \nimpossible to determine the origins of most beach trash.\n  Furthermore, not all of the plastic that is discharged by vessels \never reaches the beach. Often, plastic fishing lines and other \nmaterials are ingested by marine mammals, which mistake them for food. \nSometimes marine organisms wash up on the shore entangled in plastic.\n  In 1987, I sponsored legislation that prohibited ships from \ndischarging plastic and restricted other types of waste discharge into \nthe sea. There has been substantial improvement as a result of my \nlegislation. More, however, remains to be done.\n  The Environmental Protection Agency's 1990 National Water Quality \nInventory revealed that more than 8,500 square miles of the Nation's \nestuarine waters fail to meet water quality standards. In New Jersey \nalone, 141 square miles of estuarine waters are failing to meet water \nquality standards.\n  The Office of Technology Assessment, in a 1987 report, concluded that \nthe overall health of our coastal waters is ``declining or \nthreatened,'' and that in ``the absence of additional measures, new or \ncontinued degradation will occur in many estuaries and some coastal \nwaters around the country.'' OTA also determined that contamination of \nthe marine environment has a wide range of adverse effects on birds and \nmanuals, finfish and shellfish, aquatic vegetation and other organisms. \nIn addition, OTA concluded that existing programs, even if fully \nimplemented, are not adequate to maintain and improve our coastal \nwaters.\n  Since the Marine Plastic Pollution Research and Control Act was \npassed in 1987, I have worked with the Coast Guard to monitor and \nimprove the law's enforcement. As past Chairman of the Transportation \nAppropriations Committee, I saw to it that the Coast Guard received \nmore resources to implement this Act than it requested. Yet an \noversight hearing that I conducted highlighted numerous deficiencies in \nthe Coast Guard's enforcement of this Act.\n  To address these deficiencies I introduced the Marine Plastic \nPollution Research and Control Act Amendments of 1993 which has been \nincluded in the Coast Guard Reauthorization Act of 1995. This addition \nwill provide the Coast Guard with additional authority and impose \nstricter requirements on it, all aimed at improving enforcement of \nwaste disposal practices aboard vessels and at ports.\n  One of the most difficult enforcement problems associated with Annex \nV of the international MARPOL Convention, which the 1987 legislation \nratified, is determining whether garbage or plastics were dumped at \nsea.\n  The MARPOL section of the bill before us today addresses the ocean \ndumping problem by requiring adequate waste reception facilities at all \nports and terminals. It provides that adequacy can only be determined \nthrough on-site inspections by the Coast Guard, at which time a \ncertificate can be issued. In order to insure that facilities are \nmaintained, the certificate must be renewed every 5 years, or sooner if \nthere is a transfer of ownership or responsibility for operation.\n  At a Transportation Appropriations Subcommittee hearing I chaired \nabout 2 years ago on the Coast Guard Budget, I questioned then-Admiral \nKime about my proposals. Admiral Kime expressed strong support for this \nlegislation, indicating that it is badly needed and goes a long way \ntoward overcoming problems in inadequate enforcement.\n  Mr. President, I encourage my colleagues to support the Coast Guard \nReauthorization Act of 1995 that supports the Coast Guard and improves \nenforcement of waste disposal practices aboard vessels and at ports. \nThis bill takes a significant step toward ensuring that oceangoing \nvessels take responsibility for properly disposing of their waste, \ninstead of putting their trash onto our beaches or into the bellies of \nmarine life.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I support this bill. It contains a \nnumber of improvements in Coast Guard policy, and I commend the \nCommittee for its work.\n  I appreciate that the managers were able to include in their \namendment a provision that is important to my state. And I am very \npleased that the provision is in the bill. The provision will allow the \nState of Minnesota and the Coast Guard to cooperate in conducting a \npilot project that will allow the State in some cases to undertake the \nsafety inspection of small commercial vessels on certain navigable \nwaters of the U.S.\n  There is no more important mission of the Coast Guard than to protect \nthe safety of citizens on U.S. waters. I certainly hope we in Congress \nwill not act to diminish that mission or the Coast Guard's ability to \nperform it. I believe the provision which the managers have included to \nallow a pilot project in Minnesota can help demonstrate an innovative \nway under some circumstances to fulfill that mission completely, \nefficiently, cost-effectively and consistent with common sense.\n  The provision allows the Secretary of the Department in which the \nCoast Guard is operating to enter into an agreement with the State of \nMinnesota. Under the agreement, the State may inspect small commercial \npassenger vessels 40 feet in length or less operating in some navigable \nwaters in Minnesota. Minnesota, through its Department of Labor and \nIndustry, already operates a safety inspection program for such boats \non thousands of non-Federal bodies of water. The State has fully \ndemonstrated its competence in this program and its ability to protect \nthe public. Indeed the State's program is closely modeled already after \nthe Coast Guard's inspection program.\n  Under the provision, the State would be required to perform \ninspections that will ensure the safety and operation of the vessels in \naccord with standards that would apply if the Coast Guard itself were \nconducting the inspections. And it would require the State to report \nannually to the Secretary on the inspection program. The provision also \nallows the Secretary to adjust or waive the user fee which Congress has \nrequired the Coast Guard to collect from owners of inspected vessels \nwhen the State takes over their inspection. \n\n[[Page S 17393]]\n\n  It is my hope that the success of this model of limited \ndecentralization over the course of a 3-year pilot project can show the \nway for an appropriate sharing of responsibilities between Federal and \nState authorities in this area of public policy. At the same time, the \nprovision in no way is meant to allow any erosion or circumvention of \nsafety standards in Minnesota or in any other State. There may be other \nareas in the country where it will make sense and be completely \nconsistent with the public interest for additional States to undertake \nsimilar responsibilities. I expect that this pilot project can \ndemonstrate that possibility. But this provision itself implies no \nfuture expansion of the sharing of authority. It certainly should not \nbe interpreted to mean that consistent, uniform standards of safety and \noperation on navigable waters are unnecessary. It is necessary to have \nconsistent and uniform standards. As the provision makes explicit, all \nvessels will continue to be required to be inspected, and those \ninspections will be in accord with standards that would apply if the \nCoast Guard were conducting the inspections.\n  Mr. President, with the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990, \nCongress began to require that the Coast Guard collect fees from owners \nof vessels it inspects to offset the government cost of those \ninspections. That made sense. Unfortunately, however, the fees \nestablished have seemed very high to many who are being asked to pay \nthem, even onerous. That is why I support the cap on such fees which \nthis bill establishes for the inspection of small commercial vessels. A \n$300 fee-cap is reasonable for small vessels.\n  Additionally, though, the collection of fees revealed a certain \ninefficiency in the current inspection program--a method of operating \nwhich does not make common sense. There are certain lakes in the \ninterior of Minnesota, for example, which are designated navigable \nwaters of the U.S. because the Mississippi River, in its formative \nstage, runs through it. One of the lakes most affected by this issue is \nLake Winnibigoshish. At the Northwest end of Lake Winnibigoshish, where \nthe Mississippi River enters the lake, the river is very narrow. I \nbelieve a number of Senators could very easily swim across it at that \npoint. There is a dam at the other end of the lake, where the river \nleaves it, so there is no river traffic or commerce that uses the lake \nfor transport.\n  Lake Winnibigoshish, incidentally, Mr. President, is a large lake in \nNorthern Minnesota. It is located in the beautiful Chippewa National \nForest, and also on the Leech Lake Indian Reservation. It is an \nexcellent lake for catching walleye, our state fish, although some also \nfish there for Northern Pike and even for Muskies. In the winter a \nnumber of people drag small houses out onto the lake behind their cars \nor snowmobiles, and usually leave them there through the season, so \nthey can fish through the ice. I mention these things to give Senators \na flavor of the area of Minnesota I am discussing. Neither the cars nor \nthe fish-houses are subject to Coast Guard authority out on the ice.\n  During summer months on Lake Winnibigoshish, to continue that \nexample, there are a number of small businesses which operate what the \nfederal government considers small commercial passenger vessels. These \nin most cases are resort owners who operate fishing-guide businesses \nthat take anglers out on the lake on boats which are generally under 30 \nfeet long.\n  Until last year, Coast Guard inspectors drove once each year from \nDuluth, about 100 miles away, and inspected these boats for free. \nObviously, that was no problem for the owners. But suddenly last year, \nthe Coast Guard informed the boat owners that it would cost $545 or \n$670 per boat for the inspections, depending on the boats' length. This \nwould be an annual fee for the inspection of these small boats that are \nused for an open-water fishing season which is effectively only four or \nfive months long.\n  Now, the resort owners have acknowledged that collection of a fee is \nappropriate. They understand the value and importance of the \ninspections. But they object that the fees now being assessed are \nburdensome and out of line. Some of the resorts reportedly have stopped \noffering their fishing-guide services for groups of more than six \npassengers. The requirement does not apply when there are fewer \npassengers. But this means that they are foregoing business, which is \nnot fair and is not convenient for the visitors. Furthermore, it is \nhighly irritating to some of the resort owners, who point out that the \nState of Minnesota is conducting equivalent inspections of virtually \nidentical boats on neighboring lakes for under $100.\n  Mr. President, that is the type of situation that this provision is \nmeant to address. We want to protect the public and uphold safety \nstandards in every way. The State of Minnesota is fully capable of \ndoing that and I am sure will demonstrate so through this pilot \nproject. And these small businesses will not suffer unnecessarily \nburdensome fees. It is an example of how we can make appropriate \nregulation work in common-sense fashion by adjusting the current \ncookie-cutter, one-size-fits-all federal approach.\n  I point out that it is my understanding that the State of Minnesota \nis not interested in taking over any Coast Guard inspection duties on \nbodies of water such as Lake Superior or the Mississippi, which carry \nsubstantial interstate commerce. And I repeat that the State will \ninspect only small commercial vessels under 40 feet in length on bodies \nof water agreed upon by the State and by the Secretary.\n  I thank the managers for including the provision. And I thank the \nState of Minnesota and the Coast Guard for their cooperation during the \ndrafting process. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a letter \nof support for the provision signed by Minnesota's Commissioner of \nLabor and Industry be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                         Minneapolis Department of\n\n\n                                           Labor and Industry,\n\n                                                 November 8, 1995.\n     Hon. Paul Wellstone,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Wellstone: I write in support of the Small \n     Passenger Vessel Pilot Inspection program as included in S. \n     1004, the Coast Guard Reauthorization Act of 1995. As \n     Commissioner of the Minnesota Department of Labor and \n     Industry, I oversee the state boat inspection program. I look \n     forward to working with the United States Coast Guard to \n     expand on the efficiency of the state boat inspection safety \n     program in order to better meet the needs of the citizens of \n     Minnesota.\n       Thank you for your efforts in developing this pilot \n     project.\n           Yours truly,\n                                                  Gary W. Bastian,\n                                                     Commissioner.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3058\n\n(Purpose: To make technical minor changes in the bill as reported, and \n                          for other purposes)\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk on behalf of \nSenator Stevens.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Mississippi [Mr. Lott], for Mr. Stevens, \n     for himself, Mr. Pressler, Mr. Hollings, Mr. Kerry, Ms. \n     Snowe, Mrs. Hutchison, and Mr. Breaux proposes an amendment \n     numbered 3058.\n\n  (The text of the amendment is printed in today's Record under \n``Amendments Submitted.'')\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise as a cosponsor of the Stevens \nmanager's amendment, and I urge my colleagues to support this \namendment, along with the Chafee amendment and the underlying bill, S. \n1004.\n  S. 1004 renews the authorization for the U.S. Coast Guard--an agency \nof special importance to a State like Maine which has over 3,000 miles \nof coastline and many commercial and sport fishermen, sailing \nenthusiasts, and merchant mariners. The Commerce Committee has reported \na good, bipartisan bill, and I believe that it deserves unanimous \napproval in the Senate.\n  Among the provisions contained in this bill and in the manager's \namendment are several that I had the pleasure to author or coauthor \nwith other Senators, and that I wanted to mention here on the floor.\n  One of the longest lasting legacies of this bill will be the \npreservation of 35 lighthouses on the coast of Maine. I introduced this \nprovision as a stand-alone bill earlier in the year, S. 685, and I am \nvery pleased that we were able to include it in the Commerce \nCommittee's version of S. 1004.\n\n[[Page S 17394]]\n\n  This provision will create the Maine lights program to transfer these \nhistorically and environmentally important lighthouses to new owners \nwho will agree to maintain them, preserve their historic character, \npreserve ecological resources on adjacent property like seabird nesting \nhabitat, and provide access to the public. In short, this legislation \nprovides a way to protect these lighthouses well into the future at no \ncost to the Federal Government. Long after this bill passes, Mr. \nPresident, when our grandchildren or their children visit the Maine \ncoast and admire the lighthouses, they will have this Congress to thank \nfor its vision and its commitment to preserving such a valuable piece \nof the Nation's coastal heritage.\n  Lighthouses no longer play the crucial role in ensuring maritime \nsafety that they once did, and, in fact, the original designers of the \nlighthouses could never have imagined the impressive array of \ntechnological resources that today's Coast Guard brings to the critical \njob of protecting the maritime public. But despite the new hardware and \ntechnology, the heart of the Coast Guard's mission is still the human \nemergency response, the rescues at sea. It is critical that the Coast \nGuard maintain this capability to respond promptly and professionally \nto all accidents in American waters, even while we are engaged in the \nnecessary process to balance the budget and protect the fiscal health \nof the Nation.\n  Senator Kerry and I authored an amendment in the Commerce Committee \nthat will prevent the Coast Guard from closing any of its boat stations \nunless the Secretary first certifies that the closure will not result \nin a degradation of services that threatens life, property, the \nenvironment, or public safety. Language that I included in this \namendment provides, in particular, that a proposed station closure will \nnot hamper the Coast Guard's ability to meet its 2-hour standard for \nresponding to search-and-rescue requests.\n  Both of these provisions have been included in S. 1004, and they \nenjoy broad bipartisan support.\n  Mr. President, while S. 1004 is a good bill and deserves this body's \nsupport, the manager's amendment offered by Senator Stevens makes a \nnumber of constructive changes to S. 1004 that will improve it further. \nAmong these is a provision that I sponsored to facilitate a timely and \neffective response in the event of an oil spill in Passamaquoddy Bay on \nMaine's border with Canada.\n  Passamaquoddy Bay is a large, virtually pristine bay and estuary \nsystem that is internationally recognized as a staging area for \nmigratory waterfowl and shorebirds. In addition, the bay area has \nsubstantial economic value, hosting major aquaculture and commercial \nfishing operations, a vibrant tourism industry that depends on the \nhealth of the bay, and one of Maine's three major cargo ports.\n  Unfortunately, this important resource would be relatively \nunprotected in the event of a major oil spill. The State of Maine does \nnot have an adequate number and type of oil spill response vessels in \nthe vicinity of Passamaquoddy Bay. There are some Canadian-registered \nvessels north of the bay that could do the job, but current Federal law \nprevents these vessels from operating in U.S. waters.\n  To address this problem, I drafted a provision that has been included \nin the manager's amendment which will allow Canadian-registered vessels \nto be used in U.S. waters near the Maine-Canada border in the event of \nan oil spill. The authority only applies on a temporary and emergency \nbasis, however, and it only applies as long as U.S.-documented \nresponse-and-recovery vessels are not available to respond in a timely \nmanner. This provision will help to ensure that Passamaquoddy Bay \nreceives the maximum amount of protection from an oil spill, while \ngiving U.S. recovery vessels priority consideration for doing the work \nif they are available.\n  Finally, I wanted to reference Senator Chafee's amendment on \nfinancial responsibility under the Oil Pollution Act. I offered an \namendment in the Commerce Committee that addressed the aspect of this \nissue dealing with marinas and onshore fuel terminals. Under some \ncurrent interpretations of OPA, these facilities could have been \nsubjected to the act's extremely expensive financial responsibility \nrequirements, even though the act was intended to cover offshore \ndrilling platforms and other large production facilities that could be \ninvolved in large oil spills.\n  Mr. President, the language in the Chafee amendment reflects a \ncompromise that Senators on the Commerce and EPW Committees were able \nto reach on this issue. Among other things, it simply clarifies that \nmarinas and onshore fuel terminals are not subject to OPA's financial \nresponsibility requirements. This legislation will benefit many small \nbusinesses, boaters, commercial fishermen, oil distributors, and fuel \nconsumers across the country without jeopardizing important \nenvironmental protections.\n  These amendments will strengthen an already good bill, and I hope \nthat my colleagues will support them, and support S. 1004 on final \npassage.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the amendment \nbe agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  So the amendment (No. 3058) was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3059\n\n    (Purpose: To amend the Oil Pollution Act of 1990 to clarify the \n     financial responsibility requirements for offshore facilities)\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I send a second amendment to the desk on \nbehalf of Senator Stevens.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Mississippi [Mr. Lott], for Mr. Stevens, \n     for himself, Mr. Chafee, Mr. Breaux, and Ms. Snowe, proposes \n     an amendment numbered 3059.\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place in the bill, insert the following \n     new section:\n\n     SEC.   . OFFSHORE FACILITY FINANCIAL RESPONSIBILITY \n                   REQUIREMENTS.\n\n       (a) Amount of Financial Responsibility.--Section 1016(c)(1) \n     of the Oil Pollution Act of 1990 (33 U.S.C. 2716(c)(1)) is \n     amended to read as follows:\n       ``(1) In general.--\n       ``(A) Evidence of financial responsibility required.--\n     Except as provided in paragraph (2), a responsible party with \n     respect to an offshore facility that--\n       ``(i)(I) is located seaward of the line of ordinary low \n     water along that portion of the coast that is in direct \n     contact with the open sea and the line marking the seaward \n     limit of inland waters; or\n       ``(II) is located in inland waters, such as coastal bays or \n     estuaries, seaward of the line of ordinary low water along \n     that portion of the coast that is not in direct contact with \n     the open sea;\n       ``(ii) is used for exploring for, drilling for, or \n     producing oil, or for transporting oil from facilities \n     engaged in oil exploration, drilling, or production; and\n       ``(iii) has a worst-case oil spill discharge potential of \n     more than 1,000 barrels of oil (or a lesser amount if the \n     President determines that the risks posed by such facility \n     justify it),\n\n     shall establish and maintain evidence of financial \n     responsibility in the amount required under subparagraph (B) \n     or (C), as applicable.\n       ``(B) Amount required generally.--Except as provided in \n     subparagraph (C), the amount of financial responsibility for \n     offshore facilities that meet the criteria in subparagraph \n     (A) is--\n       ``(i) $35,000,000 for offshore facilities located seaward \n     of the seaward boundary of a State; or\n       ``(ii) $10,000,000 for offshore facilities located landward \n     of the seaward boundary of a State.\n       ``(C) Greater amount.--If the President determines that an \n     amount of financial responsibility for a responsible party \n     greater than the amount required by subparagraphs (B) and (D) \n     is justified by the relative operational, environmental, \n     human health, and other risks posed by the quantity or \n     quality of oil that is explored for, drilled for, produced, \n     stored, handled, transferred, processed or transported by the \n     responsible party, the evidence of financial responsibility \n     required shall be for an amount determined by the President \n     not exceeding $150,000,000.\n       ``(D) Multiple facilities.--In the case in which a person \n     is a responsible party for more than one facility subject to \n     this subsection, evidence of financial responsibility need be \n     established only to meet the amount applicable to the \n     facility having the greatest financial responsibility \n     requirement under this subsection.\n       ``(E) State jurisdiction.--The requirements of this \n     paragraph shall not apply if an offshore facility located \n     landward of the seaward boundary of a State is required by \n     such State to establish and maintain evidence of financial \n     responsibility in a manner comparable to, and in an amount \n     equal to or \n\n[[Page S 17395]]\n     greater than, the requirements of this paragraph.\n       ``(F) Definition.--For the purpose of this paragraph, the \n     phrase ``seaward boundary of a state'' shall mean the \n     boundaries described in section 2(b) of the Submerged Lands \n     Act (43 U.S.C. 1301(b)).''.\n\n\n                 regarding opa-90 amendment to S. 1004\n\n  Mr. Chafee. Mr. President, I rise as a cosponsor in support of the \npending amendment to the Coast Guard reauthorization bill, S. 1004. The \namendment would modify the financial responsibility requirements for \noffshore facilities under the Oil Pollution Act of 1990.\n  These requirements mandate that offshore oil-related facilities \ndemonstrate evidence of access to resources sufficient to cover the \nlikely costs of clean-up and damages arising from an oilspill. The \nimportant purpose served by these requirements is to ensure that the \npolluter--not the United States taxpayer--bears the financial burdens \nresulting from oil pollution.\n  The Environment and Public Works Committee, of which I am chairman, \nhas jurisdiction over the issues addressed in the pending amendment. In \nrecognition that jurisdiction, the primary sponsor of the amendment and \nmanager of the bill, Senator Stevens, and the Chairman Pressler of the \nCommerce Committee, which reported S. 1004, asked for my assistance in \ncrafting the amendment.\n  I am pleased to report that we were able to work together to fashion \nan amendment that will bring the financial responsibility requirements \nof the Act more into line with common sense and the original intent of \nCongress. It will allow us to avoid imposing undue and unintended \neconomic burdens while also ensuring that the act's important \nenvironmental purposes will continue to be served.\n  In particular, the amendment would do three things.\n  First, it would correct an unjustifiably broad interpretation of the \nact by the Department of the Interior. The interpretation would apply \nthe financial responsibility requirements for offshore facilities to \ntraditional onshore facilities like land-based oil terminals and \nmarinas.\n  We have many such onshore facilities in my State of Rhode Island. \nThey were never intended to be subject to the Act's financial \nresponsibility requirements for offshore facilities, even if they have \ncertain appurtenances that extend onto submerged land. This amendment \nserves to make our original intent unmistakably clear.\n  Second, the amendment would exempt from financial responsibilities \nrequirements small offshore operators who, even under a worst-case \nscenario, lack the capacity to cause a major oil spill. This de minimis \nexemption removes the potential for imposing an unjustifiably heavy \nfinancial burden on small businesses that pose only minimal \nenvironmental risk.\n  Importantly, however, the amendment does not affect the liability of \na facility that actually engages in a spill. Moreover, the President \nretains the discretion to require even a small offshore facility to \ndemonstrate evidence of financial responsibility if the risk justifies \ndoing so.\n  Third, the amendment would allow for some flexibility in the amount \nof financial responsibility to be required of non de minimis offshore \nfacilities. The Act currently directs the promulgation of regulations \nthat would require all offshore facilities to meet financial \nresponsibility requirements at a $150 million level.\n  The amendment, on the other hand, calls for use of the current $35 \nmillion requirement in the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act for \nfacilities in Federal waters, while giving the President discretion to \nincrease the requirement on the basis of risk. A similar approach is \ntaken with respect to offshore facilities in State waters, except that \nthe minimum financial responsibility requirement is $10 million given \nthat many Coastal States impose their own such requirements.\n  In sum, this amendment will remove the potential for unnecessary and \ninefficient economic burdens while preserving the act's fundamental \npurpose of ensuring that oilspill polluters pay for their pollution. It \nalso preserves the act's important safeguards and deterrents against \noil pollution in the first instance.\n  This amendment reflects a thoughtful and carefully tailored approach \nto specific issues of concern about operation of an environmental \nstatute. I want to tank Senators Stevens and Pressler gain for their \ncooperation and fine work on the amendment.\n  Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, I want to start by thanking the \ndistinguished managers of the bill, the Senator from Alaska, Senator \nStevens, and the Senator from South Carolina, Senator Hollings, and the \nSenator from Rhode Island, Senator Chafee, the distinguished chair of \nthe Environment and Public Works Committee, for all the work they have \nput into helping to craft this amendment. It retains many of the \nfeatures of S. 33, which I introduced in January of this year. I \nbelieve that it is an amendment that all of our colleagues should \nsupport.\n  This amendment addresses a serious concern--the shutting down of \nonshore and offshore oil and gas producers because they cannot meet \nonerous Federal financial responsibility standards mandated by the Oil \nPollution Act of 1990. This amendment gives the Secretary of the \nInterior the flexibility to adjust Federal financial responsibility \nrequirements to reflect the risks actually posed. Unless, this \nflexibility is provided for offshore facilities, the Oil Pollution \nAct's financial requirements will freeze out small and independent \ncompanies that drill most of the wells offshore.\n  Congress passed the Oil Pollution Act of 1990 in response to the \nExxon Valdez oilspill. It was designed to prevent oilspills and if \noilspills do occur to make sure sufficient financial resources are \navailable to clean up those spills. The statute establishes liability \nlimits and requirements of financial responsibility to meet those \nlimits. However, recent interpretation of the statute by the Department \nof the Interior indicates that legislative changes are needed to meet \ncongressional intent concerning financial responsibility for onshore \nfacilities and to correct the overly burensome financial responsibility \nrequirements for offshore facilities that threaten the viability of \nmany offshore producers.\n  When the Congress adopted the Oil Pollution Act, it clearly intended \nthat onshore facilities would not have to show evidence of financial \nresponsibility. However, a recent Interior Department solicitor's \nopinion indicates that due to the interrelationship of several \ndefinitions in the act, that they interpret the statute to require \nfinancial responsibility be shown by onshore facilities. Mr. President, \nclearly, Congress did not and does not want to require small marina \noperators or other onshore facilities to show $150 million of financial \nresponsibility. This legislation clarifies the congressional intent on \nthe law with respect to financial responsibility for onshore \nfacilities.\n  Also, this amendment gives the Minerals Management Service the \nauthority to require evidence of financial responsibility between $35 \nand $150 million based on the environmental risk posed by the facility. \nCurrent law is inflexible on this point, all offshore facilities must \nprovide evidence of $150 million regardless of how much oil they \nhandle, their history of oilspills, or other factors that would \ndetermine the true risk of an oilspill. In addition, this amendment \nprovides that any producer that handles less than 1,000 barrels of oil \nat any one time would be exempt from the financial responsibility \nrequirement. Both the $35 million financial responsibility level and \nthe 1,000 barrels were included in prior law--the Outer Continental \nShelf Lands Act.\n  This approach preserves OPA's oilspill prevention, response and \nenvironmental safeguards and liability standards, while setting \nreasonable financial responsibility requirements for offshore \nfacilities. It also recognizes the low level of risk of oilspills \nassociated with the offshore industry generally, and the fact that no \nspill on the Federal Gulf of Mexico offshore has exceeded the $35 \nmillion of financial responsibility in force before OPA. I look forward \nto working to further revise this legislation. This legislation is one \nstep that can be accomplished now to help maintain a viable domestic \nenergy industry.\n  We know that oil imports continue to rise, while the domestic energy \nindustry continues to decline.\n  In 1973--at the time of the Arab oil embargo--domestic U.S. crude oil \nproduction was 9.2 million barrels per day \n\n[[Page S 17396]]\n(mbd). By 1977, that figure had fallen to 8.1 mdb, before increasing as \nAlaska production flowed through the Trans-Alaska Pipeline System. By \n1985, domestic crude production had climbed to a post-embargo high of \n9.0 mbd. Now, 10 years later, domestic crude oil output runs at 6.6 \nmbd.\n  In 1973, the U.S. imported about 35 percent of its daily oil \nconsumption. Now, we import almost half our total oil needs--8.1 mbd \nout of a daily consumption of about 18 mbd.\n  This nation would never allow us to import more than 50 percent of \nour food supply--Is our energy supply any less important? Let us not \nforget the oil shocks of the seventies and let us not forget that just \na few years ago we sent young Americans to the Persian Gulf to protect \nour strategic interest in the oil there.\n  Thousands of oil industry workers have been laid off and it looks \nlike many more may become unemployed in the future. More than 400,000 \njobs have been lost in the oil and gas industry in the last 10 years. \nBy some estimates, 40,000 to 50,000 may have been lost in 1992 alone.\n\n  The jobs in the oil industry today are very different from those of \nyesterday. The reserves that are fast and easy to recover through \nsimple hard labor are no more. Increasingly, extraction of oil and gas \nrequires very sophisticated technology that requires a highly-skilled, \nhighly educated work force. The energy industry of today creates the \nkinds of jobs we want for tomorrow--high technology, high paying jobs.\n  Our national security depends on access to dependable domestic energy \nreserves. Unfortunately, our domestic oil and gas industry cannot turn \non a dime. No magic spigot can be turned on when the need for secure \ndomestic oil reserves become acute. The expertise needed to develop oil \nand gas is highly-specialized, particularly now that the remaining \ndomestic reserves are increasingly difficult to recover.\n  This is not just an oil and gas state interest--this is a national \ninterest. Energy fuels our cars, heats our homes, runs our factories in \nevery part of the country. Also, let us not forget the thousands of \njobs created in non-energy related sectors to service the energy \nindustry: computers, metals, transportation, financial and other \nservice industries. When domestic oil and gas producing increases so do \nthe jobs created in all these sectors.\n  Unless we take steps to help preserve a viable domestic industry, the \nnext energy crisis may be chronic and very damaging to our economy. \nUnless we act to preserve a core of talent and capital in the United \nStates, the domestic industry may not be able to deploy the necessary \ncapital investment and trained labor necessary to quickly add large \nincrements to our overall domestic supply of oil and petroleum \nproducts.\n  We can change politics as usual--the politics of crisis management--\nand we can work now to avert an energy crisis in the future. Mr. \nPresident, I believe that this amendment is a good starting point. It \ndoes not address some issues that I believe need to be addressed, but I \nlook forward to continuing to work with my colleagues to make changes \nto the Oil Pollution Act that I believe are necessary to maintain our \ndomestic energy security.\n  Again, I thank Senator Stevens, Senator Hollings and Senator Chafee, \nfor their involvement, their assistance and their encouragement in this \neffort. And, I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this \nimportant legislation.\n\n\n   An amendment to s. 1004, the coast guard authorization act of 1995\n\n  Mr. CHAFEE. The pending amendment to the Coast Guard reauthorization \nbill clarifies the financial responsibility requirements for offshore \nfacilities under the Oil Pollution Act of 1990, or ``OPA-90.'' Issues \nrelated to such requirements lie within the exclusive jurisdiction of \nthe Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works. As Chairman of \nthat Committee, I join Senator Stevens as a co-sponsor of the \namendment. I also want to take a moment to provide the background of \nthe amendment and to explain the understanding on which it is based.\n  Earlier this year Senator Breaux introduced a bill, S. 33, that \naddresses the matters contained in this amendment and was referred to \nthe Committee on Environment and Public Works.\n  Although we did not hold a formal hearing on the bill, efforts to \namend OPA-90 to clarify its offshore facility financial responsibility \nrequirements have been ongoing for several months. The House included \nsuch an amendment in its version of the Coast Guard reauthorization \nbill, H.R. 1361.\n  Upon being received in the Senate, H.R. 1361 was referred to the \nCommittee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation. Recognizing and \nrespecting the fact that OPA-90's financial responsibility requirements \nare within the jurisdiction of the Environment and Public Works \nCommittee, the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation \ndeclined to include an amendment to such requirements in the Coast \nGuard reauthorization bill it reported, S. 1004.\n\n  Instead, the chairman of the full Committee, Senator Pressler, and \nthe Chairman of the Subcommittee on Oceans and Fisheries, Senator \nStevens, wrote to ask for my cooperation and assistance in crafting an \noffshore OPA-90 amendment that could be offered upon consideration of \nS. 1004 on the Senate floor. Seventeen Senators, including four members \nof the Environment and Public Works Committee, also sent me a letter \nurging me to work with the Committee on Commerce, Science, and \nTransportation to achieve the same result.\n  In response, I agreed to work with the leadership of the Committee on \nCommerce, Science, and Transportation in an effort to forge an \namendment that would accommodate the request of my colleagues. All work \nwas done in consultation with the ranking member of the Committee on \nEnvironment and Public Works, Senator Baucus. The product of that \ncooperative labor is the amendment before the Senate at this time.\n  Also resulting from our negotiations with the Committee on Commerce, \nScience, and Transportation is an agreement that will ensure continued \nrecognition of the jurisdiction of the Committee on Environment and \nPublic Works as S. 1004 and H.R. 1361 move forward. It is especially \nimportant given the abbreviated process that I have agreed to follow \nwith respect to the OPA-90 amendment.\n  Our agreement provides that, upon passage of S. 1004 and H.R. 1361 by \nthe Senate, the Committee on Environment and Public Works will conduct \nany negotiations or discussions with the House of Representatives on \nany OPA-90 issues within the Committee's jurisdiction, including all \nissues addressed in the pending Senate amendment. If these negotiations \nor discussions fail to resolve any differences that may exist between \nthe two Chambers on such issues, the Committee on Environment and \nPublic Works will be the source of conferees on all OPA-90 issues under \nthe Committee's jurisdiction, including all issues addressed in the \npending Senate amendment. In the spirit in which the pending amendment \nwas developed, members of the Committee on Environment and Public Works \nengaged in any such negotiations or conference will consult with \nmembers of the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.\n  In conclusion, I simply would ask my good friend, the chairman of the \nCommittee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation, if what I have just \nstated comports with his understanding of our agreement.\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Yes, it does in all respects. As chairman of the \nCommittee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation, I recognize that \nthe issues addressed in the OPA-90 amendment clearly fall under the \njurisdiction of the Committee on Environment and Public Works. I have \nappreciated the willingness of the chairman of that Committee to work \nwith the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation so this \namendment could be added to the Coast Guard reauthorization bill.\n  Mr. CHAFEE.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place insert the following:\n\n     SEC.  .

Deauthorization of navigation project, Cohasset Harbor, \n              Massachusetts.\n\n\n                       cohasset dredging project\n\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I wish to engage the distinguished Chairman \nof the Committee on Environment and Public Works, Senator Chafee, in a \ncolloquy. The colloquy relates to a freestanding amendment that I have \noffered which would deauthorize portions of a navigation project at \nCohasset Harbor, MA. This deauthorization provision is clearly and \nwholly within the jurisdiction of the Committee on Environment and \nPublic Works. I recognize that it would most appropriately be dealt \nwith as an amendment to the 1995 Water Resources Development Act. \nHowever, this deauthorization is a purely technical action which \nrequires no expenditure of funds. In addition, I have recently been \ninformed that the necessary dredging of Cohasset Harbor, which cannot \nproceed without this deauthorization, will lose an existing \nappropriation of funds if this technical action is not approved by the \nCongress expeditiously. The amendment simply provides for a \nmodification to the existing coordinates of the U.S. Army Corps of \nEngineers' Cohasset Harbor dredging project.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. I have carefully reviewed the proposed amendment and \nconcur that it is a purely technical project deauthorization which \ninvolves no expenditure of funds. As such, I give my consent to the \nrequest of the Senator from Massachusetts [Mr. Kerry]. I would ask, \nhowever, that if any changes are made to this amendment, I be consulted \nbefore any final action is taken in a conference with the House.\n  Mr. STEVENS. As the manager of the Coast Guard authorization bill, I \nconcur with the views expressed here by my colleagues.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the amendment \nbe agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  So the amendment (No. 3060) was agreed to.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I further ask unanimous consent that the \ncommittee amendment be agreed to, as amended; that the bill be \nconsidered read for a third time and passed; that the motion to \nreconsider be laid upon the table; and that a number of colloquies and \nstatements appear at the appropriate place in the Record as if read.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  So the committee amendment, as amended, was agreed.\n  So the bill (S. 1004), as amended, was deemed read the third time and \npassed.\n  The bill, as passed, is as follows:\n\n                                S. 1004\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Coast Guard Authorization \n     Act of 1995''.\n\n     SEC. 2.
