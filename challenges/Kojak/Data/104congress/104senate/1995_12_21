Mr. President, we will immediately go to House Joint \nResolution 132 regarding the use of the CBO economic assumptions. There \nwill be 60 minutes of debate equally divided with an amendment ordered \nto the resolution. There should be a rollcall vote around 10:30, 10:35.\n  Also, this morning we will take up the veto message to accompany H.R. \n1058, the securities litigation. It may also be that we will take up \nthe welfare reform conference report today. It just arrived.\n  There is objection to taking up the resolution concerning application \nfor veterans' benefits unless we can add to it a CR to open up the \nGovernment. So that may or may not come up today.\n  There are other time lines that we need to address concerning AFDC \nrecipients, and other groups, that unless we have a CR, we will take \nspecific action on. I will try to determine what that is during the \nday.\n  I have not had a report on the meeting this morning between Chief of \nStaff Leon Panetta, Senator Domenici, chairman of our Budget Committee, \nand Chairman John Kasich of the House Budget Committee. I understand \nthere was some progress made.\n  It is my hope that sometime today we can meet again with the \nPresident of the United States and see if we can resolve some of the \nmajor differences still outstanding. There really are not that many big \nones, but there is Medicare and Medicaid and tax cuts. I mean there are \nsome very, very important provisions that need to be addressed.\n  Whether or not that meeting will occur, I think it is too early to \ntell. I know the Speaker and I are prepared to meet with the President \nat any time during the day.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/12/21/senate-section/article/S19025-4", "month": "12", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "21", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S19025]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Inhofe).

Under the previous order, the Senate will now \nproceed to consider House Joint Resolution 132, which the clerk will \nreport.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A joint resolution (H.J. Res. 132) affirming that budget \n     negotiations shall be based on the most recent technical and \n     economic assumptions of the Congressional Budget Office and \n     shall achieve a balanced budget by fiscal year 2002 based on \n     those assumptions.\n\n  The Senate proceeded to consider the joint resolution.\n  Mr. MACK addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. MACK. Mr. President, the night before last there was an effort to \nbring this resolution to the floor of the Senate for debate and vote \nunder a unanimous-consent request. There was objection to that request. \nMy understanding is that those who objected did so because the full \ntext of the previous language from the continuing resolution that was \npassed 30 days ago was not included. The resolution only contained \nlanguage dealing with the the requirement that the President submit to \nthe concept of a 7-year balanced budget using real numbers as generated \nby the Congressional Budget Office. That was the resolution.\n  As I understand it, there will be an effort this morning to add \nadditional language to the resolution. Frankly, I have no objection to \nthis proposal. The additional language provides for the protection of \nvarious programs, including: ensuring Medicare solvency, something that \nwe have all been working toward; reforming welfare, which clearly \n\n[[Page S19026]]\nI think we are on the verge of accomplishing; and the adoption of tax \npolicies that help working families and stimulate economic growth.\n  So I suspect there will be strong support for this resolution. But it \nis unfortunate that the Senate has to spend its time this morning on \nthis issue. It is unfortunate that the Congress has to take this time \nto remind the President of the commitment which he made over 30 days \nago.\n  There is a real question as to why the President of the United States \nhas not submitted a 7-year balanced budget plan. The President has \nsubmitted a number of budget proposals this year. I think it is three. \nI could be wrong about that. Some indicate that the President has \nsubmitted four. However, not a single one of those four budget \nproposals has eliminated the deficit in the seventh year. The \nPresident's budget plans still accumulates a tremendous amount of debt. \nThey maintain many wasteful liberal programs that have failed--that \npeople throughout the country recognize as having failed, but not one \nsingle budget proposal that the President has submitted reaches a \nbalance by the year 2002.\n  There are many people who would expect me, a Republican Senator, to \nsay these kinds of things. But I think there is evidence to indicate \nthat Senators on both sides of this aisle--and clearly the Members in \nthe other body--have rejected the President's proposals because, \nfrankly, they do not meet the test of a balanced budget as scored by \nthe Congressional Budget Office.\n  I do not remember the date or the exact vote in the Senate, but I \nremember bringing the President's first budget proposal to the Senate \nfor a vote. As I recall, not a single--well, maybe there was one \nSenator who voted for the President's proposal. But it was soundly \nrejected by both sides of the aisle. And the reason that it was \nrejected was because it did not reach a balanced budget by the year \n2002.\n  Just a few days ago the other body brought the most recent of the \nPresident's proposals to the floor of the House and it was also soundly \ndefeated. In fact, I believe there was absolutely no support, again, on \neither side of the aisle for the President's budget proposal.\n  Let me give a little explanation as to what that budget proposal was.\n  The fourth submission by the President which the administration \nclaimed to be in balance was finally scored by the Congressional Budget \nOffice and was, in fact, $116 billion short in the seventh year. Again, \nthe administration wants to create the impression that it is for a \nbalanced budget but continues to fail to come forward with a plan that \nbalances the budget in 7 years with CBO numbers.\n  Now, I am under the impression, or I have been given information \nwhich indicates that the minority leader has a proposal now that would, \naccording to their numbers which we have been told are based on CBO \nassumptions reach a balance in the budget by the year 2002. I think \nthis is a helpful first step.\n  But again, the President just absolutely refuses to come forward with \na plan that balances the budget. Let me give you my perspective as to \nwhy he will not do it. He simply does not want to tell the people in \nthe country those things that he supports. He does not want to choose \nthose Federal programs which he thinks are so important that they need \nto be protected. Oh, clearly he has made his statement with respect to \nMedicare and Medicaid, but he has not talked about any other programs \nin the Federal Government that he wants to continue in force. Because \nin order for the President to keep those programs in force, to keep \nthem growing, to keep them as part of the Federal budget, he has to \nindicate what other programs he is willing to cut. And he does not want \nanybody to know what programs he is willing to cut or eliminate.\n  It is time. The country is waiting. The country is committed to a \nbalanced budget in 7 years. Eventually, the polling data is going to \nindicate that. Eventually, the President is going to get the message.\n  There is one other indicator that I think will get the President's \nattention as well. I do not know whether this is a record, and my \ncolleague, Senator Exon, may be aware of whether it is a record or not. \nBut I understand that yesterday while the President was announcing that \nthere would not be a meeting between himself and the leaders of the \nHouse and the Senate, the market fell 50 points in somewhere between 10 \nand 15 minutes. I have been told that that is a record.\n  I have a feeling that what is happening in the markets, a decline of \n100 points 2 days ago, or 3 days ago and a decline yesterday of an \nadditional 50 points, probably has the President's attention. I say \nthis because the point which we have been making on this side is that \none of the benefits derived from a balanced budget is lower interest \nrates. This means lower mortgage payments. This means more affordable \nstudent loans. This means lower taxes for American families. Everybody \nbenefits from a balanced budget. But when the market heard that the \nPresident was not going to meet with the leaders of the House and the \nSenate, the market dropped 50 points in about 15 minutes. I would \nsuggest to the President it is time now to get serious about balancing \nthe budget, doing it with real numbers, using CBO, and getting it done \nover a 7-year period.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. EXON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, the matter before us is one that I think \ndoes not require a great deal of debate and consideration. I think \nprobably it is going to be overwhelmingly approved if we have a voice \nvote on the matter. I simply say that I am not sure at this particular \njuncture, when the Government is shut down, when there is great anxiety \nin America that we get on with this matter of balancing the budget, it \nis particularly helpful to go on another diatribe and sharp debate in \nthe Senate on scolding the President or scolding other people.\n  I noticed with interest the manager of this measure on the other side \nindicated that we never have come forth. We have a program, of which \nthis Senator was a chief author, that does, indeed, balance the budget \nin 7 years, does, indeed, balance the budget based on CBO numbers, \nperiod, without any caveats whatsoever.\n  So in total keeping with the cooperation that has come forth from the \nDemocratic side, we are in basic agreement with what we are attempting \nto do here, and therefore it is simply a statement of what once again \nis the obvious.\n  What I am attempting to do at this time is to restrain our rhetoric, \nto restrain our differences of opinion as to how we reach that goal of \na balanced budget in 7 years using the conservative scoring techniques \nof the Congressional Budget Office, which, I might add, has been proven \nwrong. The figures by CBO have been wrong the last 2 years by a very \nlarge proportion and all other scoring outside of CBO has been right \nwith regard to what the economy has been doing. There cannot be any \nquestion about that.\n  Regardless of that, I simply say that I think this is the time of \ncoming together rather than to try to blame everybody else for what has \nor has not happened up to date. The facts are that it is a national \ndisgrace that here we are in a situation 2 or 3 or 4 days before \nChristmas Eve, people are being sent home and laid off, the Government \nis being shut down, while at the same time I see certain leaders \nrushing to the floor or rushing to the microphones to say, ``Well, all \nyou employees that have been sent home because of the impasse that we \nhave created, regardless of whose fault it is, do not worry; you are \ngoing to be paid. We are going to have the taxpayers pay you even \nthough you are not at work.''\n  That is one of the reasons, Mr. President, that as far as this \nSenator was concerned and many others, I kept each and every one of my \nemployees at their post during the last Government shutdown when others \nwere rushing to send them home in the spirit of shutting down \nGovernment. I knew that was a ridiculous proposal because I knew that \nif I had sent my good associates and coworkers, over which I have \ncontrol, home, they would be sitting at home twiddling their thumbs, \ndoing nothing, wishing that they were at work with the full realization \nthat they were going to be paid even though we sent them home. That is \npart of the phoniness, I suggest, of this whole process that we are \ngoing through. If we cannot come to an understanding of \n\n[[Page S19027]]\na continuing resolution to keep Government fully operating between now \nand Friday, which is 2 days from now, then it shows how ridiculous all \nthis impasse has been, meant to create something, I guess, from the \nstandpoint of a revolution, a revolution that is taking place without \ndue consideration for all others.\n  With regard to the President of the United States, I have not agreed \nwith the original budget presented by the President of the United \nStates as the Democratic leader on the Budget Committee, but I think \nthe President of the United States is not all right or all wrong. I do \nnot know whether I am all right or all wrong in our proposal. I believe \nthe Democratic leader, Senator Daschle, does not claim that the plan \nthat we have put together and offered that does, indeed, do exactly \nwhat has been demanded by some, balancing the budget in 7 years, with \nCBO scoring--we have met all those commitments in the plan we offered \nyesterday--is all right or all wrong.\n  Our plan has not been universally blessed by the President of the \nUnited States, but I believe the President of the United States \nrealizes and recognizes there is going to have to be some give and \ntake, there is going to have to be some compromise, there is going to \nhave to be some understanding, there is going to have to be something \nmore than political rhetoric back and forth on both sides. If we are to \ncome together, as I think we must, as reasoned adult people, to \nrecognize with 535 Members of the Congress of the United States, there \nis no way we are going to write a budget that each and every one of \nthose 535 Members says, ``Boy, that's fine. That's just what I want.''\n  So I would simply say, Mr. President, that we are working very hard \nin a bipartisan fashion to try and come together, and I am not sure \nthat a great deal of rhetoric on this measure that probably is not \ngoing to be seriously contested from either its intent or its language, \nbecause we generally agree.\n  I yield whatever time is necessary to the Democratic leader.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I thank the distinguished Senator from Nebraska.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3108\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I have an amendment and ask for its \nimmediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from South Dakota [Mr. Daschle] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 3108 as follows:\n       On page 2, line 2, strike office''; and insert the \n     following: ``Office, and the President and the Congress agree \n     that the balanced budget must protect future generations, \n     ensure Medicare solvency, reform welfare, and provide \n     adequate funding for Medicaid, education, agriculture, \n     national defense, veternas, and the environment. Further, the \n     balanced budget shall adopt tax policies to help working \n     families and to stimulate future economic growth.''\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, the purpose of this amendment is simply \nto restate the principles that we outlined on November 19, when we \npassed the last complete continuing resolution. In that continuing \nresolution, we did two things. We asserted again our belief in the need \nto find a way to balance the budget within 7 years, ultimately scored \nby CBO, but to also protect the priorities that we as Democrats have \nbeen talking about for a long period of time; Medicare, Medicaid, \nreforming welfare, education, agriculture, defense, veterans, the \nenvironment. These are fundamental investments that this country has \nmade in our people, strengthening the nation and enhancing our \nsecurity.\n  So as we debate the importance of a balanced budget in 7 years, we \nalso must debate the consequences of that we make toward that end. And \nso this amendment--in my view, improves upon the resolution that is \npending. And I hope that it will enjoy unanimous support given the fact \nthat the continuing resolution received such support on November 19.\n  The distinguished Senator from Nebraska said a number of things with \nwhich I wish to associate myself. Most importantly, while this is a \nfine resolution in which we again assert our support for a balanced \nbudget, the more pressing resolution ought to be the one that funds the \nGovernment. We should take care of the immediate and unnecessary crisis \nbefore us, as we proceed with negotiations for a 7-year balanced \nbudget.\n  The taxpayers are getting cheated, Mr. President, when tens of \nthousands of Government employees are not at work. They are not getting \nthe services they deserve and expect when people are sent home. And the \nsad tragedy of it all is that it is not necessary. There is no direct \nconnection between funding the Government through these appropriations \nbills and passing a budget resolution. It has been the design of some \nto make that connection, but there is none. And people should not be \nconfused by it.\n  So I hope that sometime today we could pass a continuing resolution \nputting people back to work, making sure that the taxpayers get not \nonly what they expect in a 7-year budget resolution, but also the \nservices that they pay for with their tax dollars every day.\n  I might just say one other thing with regard to this particular \nresolution. I am sure that many of our colleagues will continue to \ninsist that whatever we agree upon be scored by the Congressional \nBudget Office. CBO has been a very important institution within the \nCongress now for over 20 years. We have turned to the CBO time and \nagain for objective analysis in the hope that we could project with as \nmuch clarity as possible the economic repercussions that will result \nfrom the decisions we make.\n  In the past, every single CBO director has had strong bipartisan \nsupport--bipartisan support--prior to the time he or she has taken \noffice. Unfortunately, that was not the case this year. In the past, on \na bipartisan basis, Members have acknowledged the authenticity, the \nclarity, and the integrity of CBO numbers, even when they worked \nagainst us.\n  I can recall so vividly the health care debate 2 years ago where CBO \nargued with us vociferously about our projections with regard to the \nimpact of the health care reform bill. We didn't like what they had to \nsay, but we had to deal with that. We had to accept that because the \ndirector at the time was the appointed official in charge of making \nthose projections. And while we disagreed, we accepted his authority.\n  I must say, Mr. President, I am disturbed this year about the \ncredibility of this particular director and CBO's activities in the \nlast 7 months. I hope in the future that they will be especially \ncareful to not in any way reflect a partisan bent in the work that they \ndo. Because I am troubled by the very difficult time we have had in \ngetting responses and getting information. And I am troubled by the \nmanner in which much of the information has been presented to the \nCongress.\n  I am also troubled, frankly, by the projections themselves. While I \nwould like to believe that these projections are not driven by a \npartisan motivation, I am concerned when I see the very esteemed blue-\nchip forecasters agreeing virtually down the line with the Office of \nManagement and Budget about what happens when we actually achieve what \nwe say we want in this resolution.\n  We have all made our speeches about the importance of a balanced \nbudget in terms of bringing down the rates of interest, about the \neffect it will have on unemployment, about the effect it will have on \ncorporate profits, about the effect it will have on the economy itself. \nAnd it has been that expectation that has driven my support for a \nbalanced budget.\n  So it is troubling to see CBO projections predicting just the \nopposite, predicting a decline in real wages, a decline in corporate \nprofits, a decline in economic growth, a decline in overall economic \nactivity and vitality within the economy. These issues ought to be a \nvery central feature as we debate this overall resolution.\n  Do we expect to see better economic performance than CBO now \nprojects? I think we will. If we do not, what does it say about the \nimpact of a balanced budget? Democrats all expect good things to \ndevelop. I believe that under a balanced budget they will develop. And \nit is one of the reasons we have fought so hard on this point, because \nwe think that the economy will do a lot better than CBO now projects. \nSo this issue should remain on the table, and the very positive effects \nof our actions ought to be something that remains a part of these \nnegotiations. \n\n[[Page S19028]]\n\n  So, today, once again we will express our support for a CBO-scored \nresolution at the end of all of this, not at the beginning, not during \nthe debate, not during the negotiations, but at the end. We expect that \nCBO and the blue-chip forecasters and OMB can give us the best \ninformation available about what this means in terms of the policy \nramifications, and we look forward to receiving that information when \nwe have an agreement.\n  So it is with a caveat that we say, yes, we will score our numbers \nwith CBO, as we have done for more than 20 years. But let us be \nrealistic about projections and be a little more optimistic about what \nall this may mean, for I fear that we are going to send exactly the \nwrong message if we do not.\n  But perhaps of all of the considerations to be made, as we vote on \nthis resolution later on this morning, is the insistence that these \npriorities be identified and be assured as we consider how we balance \nthe budget in 7 years.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Santorum). Who yields time?\n  Mr. MACK. Mr. President, how much time remains on our side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There are 21 minutes 55 seconds remaining.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, because the amendment amends the \npreamble, I ask unanimous consent that the amendment be in order at \nthis time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. MACK. How much time is remaining on the Democratic side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There are 15 minutes 31 seconds remaining.\n  Mr. MACK. I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from Oklahoma.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I was interested to hear my friend and \ncolleague, Senator Daschle, express concern about the integrity and the \naccuracy of the Congressional Budget Office. I could not help but be \namused because earlier this year Senator Daschle offered a balanced \nbudget constitutional amendment on behalf of the other side of the \naisle that wrote the Congressional Budget Office's authority in these \nmatters into the Constitution. I just find kind of interesting that now \nhe is questioning their methods or partisanship.\n  I am very supportive of the resolution before the Senate. I am \noptimistic it will pass. A similar resolution has already passed \noverwhelmingly in the House, and I hope this one will pass \noverwhelmingly in the Senate today. Maybe the President will pay \nattention to it. It has been very, very bothersome to me, after the \nGovernment shutdown of a month ago when the President signed on to a \nresolution that agreed to a balanced budget in 7 years using CBO \nnumbers, that he still has not done so. One would think if he signed \nthat law, he would comply with it. He has yet to do so.\n  President Clinton has now submitted four budgets, none of which are \nin balance as scored by CBO, none of which are even close to being in \nbalance.\n  His first budget had deficits increasing from $200 billion up toward \n$300 billion. His second budget, which came out in June, had deficits \nof $200 billion forever, as scored by CBO. His third budget, which came \nwithin the last month, had a deficit of $115 billion in the seventh \nyear. It may be better than $200 billion, but it is still $115 billion. \nThat is not even close to being balanced.\n  His fourth budget submitted last week still has deficits very close \nto $100 billion. It also has a back-door tax increase. The President \nsays, ``Well, if we don't meet our deficit targets, we'll have \nautomatic tax increases.'' What Congress has done in the past if we did \nnot meet our deficit targets is have automatic spending reductions. But \nno, the President does not want to reduce the amount of money \nWashington spends; he wants to take more money from individuals. That \nwas his approach under his fourth budget.\n  Even given the President's automatic tax increases in the last couple \nyears, he still does not come up with a balanced budget. So now \nCongress feels it is necessary to remind the President, ``The current \nnegotiations between Congress and the President shall be based on the \nmost recent technical and economic assumptions of CBO and that we are \ngoing to reach agreement this year.''\n  You would think the President's common sense would say, ``Let's \nsubmit a balanced budget using CBO numbers.'' He still refuses to do \nthat.\n  A lot of people are asking, ``Why did we have the breakdown in talks \nyesterday?'' Speaker Gingrich and Leader Dole come out of a meeting \nwith the President the day before and they said, ``Everyone agrees to \nuse CBO numbers. We're going to work hard. We're going to be the \nprincipals, with the President of the United States, and we're going to \nnegotiate the agreement. We're going to try to get it done this year.'' \nThat was the statement made by the leaders.\n  Shortly after that, the Vice President came out and said the \nPresident did not agree to that. They said the final agreement may be \nscored by CBO, but they never said the President would be willing to \nsubmit a balanced budget. The House of Representatives, understandably, \nbecame quite upset. Many House Members said, ``Wait a minute, this \nsounds like the same reaction we got when we thought we had an \nagreement with the administration a month ago,'' and they have yet to \ncomply.\n  Then last night, the President went on TV and said, ``I thought the \nSpeaker and the Republican leader gave their word that we would \ncontinue funding Government. And who can I deal with if they can't keep \ntheir word?\"\n  That bothered me, because I remember the President of the United \nStates standing in the well of the House before a joint session of \nCongress and the entire American public and saying, ``We're not going \nto hassle over which numbers and which economic assumptions to use, \nwe're not going to use smoke and mirrors, we're going to use \nCongressional Budget Office numbers and we're going to work together to \nget the deficit down.''\n  He has not done that. He has not kept his word, and that bothers me. \nFor the last month, he has yet to submit a balanced budget. We are \ntrying to negotiate, we are trying to enact a balanced budget, and yet \nthe President is on a different playing field. We are trying to work \nout our differences. We want to compare apples to apples, and yet he \nwill not agree to the same assumptions, and it is impossible to do.\n  I compliment my colleagues on the other side of the aisle who \nevidently today are going to submit a balanced budget using CBO \nnumbers. I compliment them for that. They are on the same playing \nfield. We can work out the differences, even though that is not easily \ndone. I know it is not easily done. So, again, I compliment my \ncolleagues who are willing to do that. Let us work together. There are \na lot of us who want to make this happen. We are not just interested in \nRepublicans scoring points or the Democrats scoring points or who is \ngoing to win.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for an additional \n1 minute.\n  Mr. MACK. I yield the Senator 1 additional minute.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, for us to have success, it cannot be a \nRepublican victory or a Democratic victory or a Presidential victory, \nit is going to have to be an American victory. It is going to have to \nbe a victory where we unite, where we curtail the growth of entitlement \nprograms, where we make responsible decisions and both sides can \ndeclare victory. A victory on behalf of Congress, a victory on behalf \nof the administration and, most importantly, a victory on behalf of the \nAmerican people. It needs to happen, and it needs to happen this year.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and thank my colleague from Florida.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. EXON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska is recognized.\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, once again, I say that I am tempted to \nanswer word for word, charge for charge what is being made on the other \nside. I will be restrained. When I get up in the morning, I go through \na few exercises, maybe take a little walk and then have breakfast. My \nmain desire when I get out of bed in the morning is not to come to the \nfloor of the U.S. Senate to bash the President of the United States. \n\n[[Page S19029]]\n\n  I will simply say, while the President of the United States has not \nalways come up with the numbers with regard to a balanced budget that \nthis Senator would like to see, as I said a few moments ago, I simply \nsay that the record is pretty clear that this President has done a \nbetter job than most Presidents of the United States in modern times \nwith regard to trying to restrain the deficit.\n  The fact of the matter is that in 3 straight years under President \nClinton, we have had a significant reduction of nearly 50 percent in \nthe annual deficits. That is the first time that has happened since the \nadministration of another Democratic President by the name of Harry S. \nTruman.\n  So I do not know that Clinton bashing--although it is vogue in some \nquarters today--is particularly helpful at this juncture when we are \ntrying to come together rather than split ourselves further apart. I \nyield 7 minutes to the Senator from Minnesota.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota is recognized for 7 \nminutes.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Thank you, Mr. President. Mr. President, let me, first \nof all, thank the Senator from Nebraska. I do not think there is \nprobably one Senator here, Democrat or Republican alike, who does not \nhave tremendous respect for the work that he has done. I am really \nsorry to see him leave the Senate. I think it is a great loss for the \ncountry.\n  When I came here, I only knew about the Senator from Nebraska. Boy, \nas I had a chance to watch him, if you want to talk about a marriage of \npersonal integrity with commitment to people and commitment to country, \nthere is not anybody who does any better than the Senator from \nNebraska.\n  Mr. EXON. May I interrupt for just a moment and thank my friend from \nMinnesota. I only yielded him 7 minutes, but with the tone he is \nfollowing, he can have about 5 hours. [Laughter.]\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, first of all, just to try to cut \nthrough all the rhetoric--and we are trying to get past all of that--\nthe fact of the matter is, and we all know it, this is not just a \ndebate about numbers. We are talking about policies that will \ndramatically affect people's lives, the quality or lack of quality of \npeople's lives, depending on what we do. We do not just disagree about \nnumbers. There are major policy differences in the health care area, in \nchildren's issues, environment issues, in terms of what constitutes \nfair taxes--you name it.\n  The fact of the matter is--and people in the country know it--there \nshould not be some rush to recklessness. These differences are not \ngoing to be worked out in 4 days. Nobody can force that or make a \nthreat to make that happen. We all ought to be serious about the \nnegotiations, and I think we all are. We should have difficult and \nsubstantive negotiations and debate, not hate. But you cannot shut the \nGovernment down and say, ``If we do not get exactly what we want when \nwe want it, the Government will stay shut down.'' This does not serve \nthe country well or serve any of us well. That is my first point.\n  My second point is that I would like to thank the Senator from \nNebraska, and others. I have been involved in many of these meetings, \nand many of us have worked very hard. I think there is much in the \nDemocratic alternative that makes sense. That is to say, it is clear to \nme that there is no question when laid alongside what the Republicans \nhave proposed, what the Democrats have proposed, I think, at least \ncomes much closer to meeting the Minnesota standard of fairness. It \ndoes not make any sense when my colleague from Oklahoma says, ``We want \nto do something that benefits the American people.'' The question \nbecomes: Which people?\n  If you are going to have huge numbers of tax cuts, several hundred \nbillion dollars of tax cuts, which, in the main, flow to the people who \nare most affluent, to the largest corporations, multinational \ncorporations, and at the same time you have reductions in health care \nprograms that are so important to seniors or children or working \nfamilies, I am not sure that it does benefit most of the American \npeople. To have zero in tax giveaways makes a great deal of sense. To \nmake a strong commitment to medical assistance and children--everybody \nhas heard our priorities--I think makes a great deal of sense. To do a \nlittle bit better in terms of asking some of the larger corporations to \npay their fair share to eliminate some of the tax loopholes and \noutright tax giveaways, I think, meets a standard of fairness in this \ncountry.\n  So, Mr. President, I think that this budget, compared to the \nRepublican budget, comes much closer to meeting a basic standard of \nfairness. I congratulate colleagues for their work on this.\n  Mr. President, there is, however, one question that I still have \nabout all of this. That has to do with why it is that there is not more \non the table in terms of where we can make cuts. There was a book \nwritten by Donald Barlett and James Steele, called ``America: What Went \nWrong.'' It won a Pulitzer Prize. Then this book came out, which is \ncalled ``America: Who Really Pays the Taxes.''\n  On the first page, the sentence that caught my attention says: ``That \nwhen members of Congress talk about cutting entitlements, they mean \nyours--not theirs.''\n  Then they go on and they talk about tax law and they say there is \n``one for the rich and powerful--call the Privileged Person's Tax Law; \nanother for you and everyone else--call it the Common Person's Tax \nLaw.''\n  Now I jump to a letter that the Senator from Massachusetts sent in \nresponse to some ads that have come out by some of the leading \ncorporate executives calling for resolution of this budget crisis where \nthe Senator from Massachusetts calls on them to agree that tax \nsubsidies for wealthy individuals and corporations should bear their \nfair share of the reductions needed to reach a balanced budget.\n  I now read from one paragraph I think is extremely interesting:\n\n       I make the following proposal, the Republican plan would \n     provide a reduction of 17 percent in the Federal budget in \n     the next 7 years, exclusive of defense spending and Social \n     Security. Reducing the $4 trillion in tax subsidies by 17 \n     percent would achieve savings of $680 billion. If we applied \n     the 17 percent reduction to only one-quarter of the tax \n     expenditures, we would save $170 billion, a huge step toward \n     providing the additional savings needed in the current \n     impasse to balance the budget fairly in 7 years.\n\n  This is the disconnect between Washington and the rest of the country \nthat I do not understand, because 70 to 80 percent of the country will \nsay, ``Look, if you are going to ask everybody to tighten their belts, \nlook at some of these tax giveaways to some of these huge multinational \ncorporations and ask them to be a part of the sacrifice. Why focus on \nnutrition for children, or Medicare for seniors, but not these \nsubsidies for oil companies, or tobacco companies, or pharmaceutical \ncompanies, you name it?\"\n  Mr. President, I do not understand why it is we cannot do more. As \nSenator Kennedy said in this letter, we are talking about a tiny \npercentage, which can net $170 billion. It seems to me that what \nexplains the difference is sort of power in America. I really think if \nthis deficit reduction is going to be based upon a standard of \nfairness, this corporate welfare has to be on the table, and we have to \ndo a better job in terms of plugging some of these loopholes and doing \naway with some of these tax giveaways.\n  The second point is the Pentagon budget. Mr. President, let me simply \nsay that by a conservative estimate, over 10 years, you could have $114 \nbillion of reduction in Pentagon expenditures. I have a chart of a \nvariety of different ways. Many people have said, my God, can we not \nalso look at the military contractors and have some reductions here? \nMr. President, I remind my colleagues that the real national security \nis not more B-2 bombers that the Pentagon says it does not need, to the \ntune of $1.5 billion each. The real national security is when we invest \nin people in our own communities. I would argue that the corporate \nwelfare and some of the military contracts ought to be on the table and \nthat we can do better in terms of meeting the standard of fairness, \nsince we all agree that we have to balance the budget.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. MACK. Mr. President, I yield 4 minutes to the distinguished \nSenator from Michigan.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I want to make a couple of comments today \nin response to some issues that have been raised and then focus on what \nI think we are about here. \n\n[[Page S19030]]\n\n  Earlier, concerns were raised with respect to the manner in which the \nnonpartisan Congressional Budget Office scores the various polices and \neconomic projections that make up the budget. In response to these \nremarks, I would like to say this: In my State of Michigan, people are \nconcerned with the way Washington does its bookkeeping. For them, the \nprincipal criticism of the Congressional Budget Office, leaving aside \nthe issue of whether it is partisan or not, is that it is too \noptimistic.\n  In Michigan, and other States as well, average working men and women \nthink Washington has been way too liberal in our bookkeeping for way \ntoo long. Too often in the past, we relied on rosy economic projections \nto make it appear as if we were taking action, whether it was in \ndeficit reduction or in any other area of Federal Government activity, \nonly to see those rosy scenarios unrealized.\n  For that reason, it is in our interest to have a budget office that \nscores our legislation on a conservative basis. Mr. President, I have \nvery little fear that Congress will have difficulty figuring how to \nspend the surplus, should the Congressional Budget Office's numbers \nprove to be too conservative. On the other hand, I am confident, based \nupon the last 25 years of behavior, that Congress will have a very \ndifficult time making additional spending cuts, if we use too \noptimistic projections that result in future deficits.\n  I should point out that the Congressional Budget Office is taking the \nsame kind of conservative approach that the average American family \ntakes when it projects how it is going to handle its finances. I know \nin my family, and in families across the country, nobody sits down and \nsays, ``I think there is a good chance I am going to get a big raise in \n2 years or 4 years,'' and base all of their spending decisions on that \nassumption. Instead, they try to be, if anything, conservative in their \nexpectations so that they do not end up in debt. So I applaud the \nCongressional Budget Office for its efforts to finally bring a \nconservative, practical approach to the way it does its business.\n  Second, Mr. President, I think it is important that this resolution \nbrings us back to what we are about. What we are about is balancing the \nbudget and reducing the growth of Government. We are about trying to \nmake sure that Government does not consume so much of our wealth so \nthat the people in America, the families in this country, find \nthemselves spending too much of their time working for us in Washington \ninstead of the other way around.\n  In addition, Mr. President, what we are about is allowing those \nfamilies to keep more of what they earn. This resolution--and I think \nwe should not lose sight of it--includes provisions for reducing the \ntax burden on families and stimulating economic growth. That is \nimportant.\n  We learned in previous budget deals that increasing taxes on this \ncountry's job creators hurts families. I believe there was a \nsignificant luxury tax on boats that was imposed 5 years ago. What \nhappened? To no one's surprise, at least to people who look at these \nthings in the economic sense, the number of boats being produced in \nthis country quickly and dramatically dropped. Numerous boat builders \nwent out of business, and thousands of jobs were destroyed. So that \nluxury tax was repealed. A whole industry of working people with \nfamilies found themselves suffering because we thought you can tax and \ntax and not have repercussions that affect average people. Instead, as \nthis resolution makes clear, we should reduce the tax burden on \nfamilies and businesses alike.\n  In conclusion, Mr. President, what we are about is balancing the \nbudget, letting people keep more of what they earn, and putting our \npriorities in the right order. That is why this resolution should pass. \nI urge its adoption.\n  Mr. MACK. I yield 4 minutes to the distinguished Senator from \nGeorgia.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I rise in support of the resolution as \nwell. I want to reinforce the remarks that have just been made by the \ndistinguished Senator from Michigan.\n  I point out that since the Congressional Budget Office began \nforecasting in 1976, it has been more accurate than OMB private \nforecasters on the four economic indicators most important to the \nbudget: inflation, economic growth, 3-month Treasury bills, and 10-year \ninterest rates. In long-run forecasts, CBO has outpurchased OMB for 12 \nof the last 15 years. In fact, both CBO and the past five \nadministrations have been more likely to be too optimistic instead of \ntoo pessimistic. As June O'Neill says, it is CBO's view that erring on \nthe side of caution increases--increases--the likelihood that a \nbalanced budget will actually be achieved in the time desired.\n\n  Mr. President, I want to respond to my colleague from Nebraska, \nSenator Exon's remarks, about acrimony. Certainly we have seen that, \nbut the President does not escape the admonition of the Senator from \nNebraska. If you watch any of the newscasts or any of pronouncements \nthat have been made by the President with regard to the balanced \nbudget, you would see immediately that he is engaged in the very \npractice that you suggested that we should not.\n  Today, because of paid advertising and the President's remarks about \nour proposals for Medicare, a majority of Americans believe that our \nbudget either freezes the investment per beneficiary, or a third of the \nAmericans believe that our budget cuts the payments--cuts them. That is \nnot true. But the President continues to say that over and over and \nover. Now, in time, I am not concerned about it because the truth will \ncome out. The fact that we are increasing our spending on Medicare by \n71 percent--actually a bit more than suggested by the First Lady in the \nhealth care debate last year-- that is not true, but it is repeated \ndespite the fact that even Washington Post editorials have called his \ncomments shameless. If you talk about the demeanor of the Senate, I \nhope that you would address some of those remarks to the White House \nitself.\n  With regard to the balanced budget, I think it useful from time to \ntime to review the lineage of the debate, Mr. President. It began with \nthe effort to pass a balanced budget amendment which failed in this \nSenate by one vote. Had the President supported the balanced budget \namendment, I believe it would have passed with 75 votes in the Senate, \nbecause clearly a number of Members on the other side of the aisle \nchanged their vote over the President's admonition or suggestion that \nwe not have a balanced budget amendment.\n  At the time, the argument made was that the Congress simply had to \nhave the will. We did not need an amendment to the Constitution, we \nneeded the will. For the first time, this Congress in almost three \ndecades has developed a will and passed a balanced budget.\n  I rise in support of this. I hope all my colleagues will come to the \ntable for a Balanced Budget Act this session.\n  Mr. EXON. I yield 2 minutes to the Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. FORD. I thank my friend.\n  Mr. President, I am a little bit older than some in this Chamber and \ngoing back to the years when I was growing up, my grandfather would not \nmake any kind of a contract on Sunday. He never had to worry about \nsigning a paper during the week; we always shook hands. A handshake was \nour bond, and our word was our bond.\n  I hear a lot about all the blame on the President. I listened to the \nmajority leader say now we are finally going to get some adults to \nnegotiate the balanced budget--some adults. Well, the President calls \nto get the adults together, I guess. That was the majority leader, the \nSpeaker of the House of Representatives, and the President of the \nUnited States. They shook hands after 2\\1/2\\ hours, or better than 2 \nhours, I understand, on what they would do.\n  The Democratic Caucus in the Senate voted unanimously under those \ncircumstances to give to our minority leader, our Democratic leader, \nthe ability to go and represent us. I assumed from the remarks of the \nmajority leader that he had the same respect and admonition from those \non his side. But, lo and behold, the Speaker of the House could not get \nhis caucus to agree to sit down and work out a CR, to develop the \nframework, to arrive at a balanced budget in 7 years.\n  We hear the CBO is conservative and OMB is optimistic. Let me just \nsay, something happened to CBO. They got optimistic and increased their \nprojection by $135 billion and got them closer to OMB. I yield the \nfloor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida has 7 minutes and 25 \n\n[[Page S19031]]\n  seconds, and the Senator from Nebraska has 1 minute.\n  Mr. MACK. I yield 4 minutes to the Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I rise in support of the resolution. It \nseems to me it is a very important restatement of where we have been.\n  I appreciated the enumeration of the Senator from Kentucky of what \nhas happened here. One of the difficulties is that the Vice President \ncame on TV and said there is no agreement, and that caused people to \nhave some concern.\n  I take my 3 minutes to get away a little bit from the numbers and put \nmyself back in Cody, WY, where I grew up, and say, what is the \nresponsibility here to do something about balancing the budget as a \ncitizen? It seems to me there are several that are very meaningful.\n  No. 1, it is personal, it is parochial, it is selfish, I suppose.\n  I think if we can balance the budget, it means that every family that \nhas loans on their home, every family that has loans on their car, \nevery family that has educational loans will find, because of lower \ninterest, there is a benefit of $2,500 or $3,000 to many families.\n  I think, second, it has something to do with responsibility. If we \nare going to enjoy some benefits, those of us who are enjoying them, we \nshould pay for them. This idea of enjoying the benefits and putting it \non the credit card for someone else does not fly. This is a democracy. \nThis is freedom that we protect. With that goes some responsibility to \ndo some things.\n  Concern about our kids--we have to be concerned about the future, \nwhen interest becomes the largest single line item in the budget, \ninterest on the debt, and we simply pass that along, along with $5 \ntrillion in debt.\n  I think we have to have some consideration for change in the \ndirection of Government. I really believe most people say the Federal \nGovernment is too big and it costs too much and we need to change that. \nThat is a fundamental change we are seeking to do here. Balancing the \nbudget and doing something about containing the growth of entitlements \nis a fundamental issue. It is not arithmetic. That is what is going on \nhere. I think it is terribly important.\n  Credibility--I think there is a certain function of credibility in \nthis body. We have said we are going to balance the budget. We have \nsaid, in a resolution some 30 days ago, we are going to balance the \nbudget in 7 years, using CBO numbers. We ought to do that. Many of us \ncame here--we have not been here as long as some others--and we said \none of the things we want to do is we want to be responsible in \nspending and balancing the budget. There is a credibility question here \nfor all of us.\n  So, Mr. President, I certainly think we have a great opportunity to \nmove forward, not only this morning but in this total matter of \nbalancing the budget. We can do it. We have an opportunity, the first \nopportunity in nearly 30 years. It would be a shame not to take \nadvantage of it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. MACK. I inquire how much time remains.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There remains 4 minutes and 30 seconds.\n  Mr. MACK. I yield 1 minute to the Senator from Idaho.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho is recognized for 1 \nminute.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, let me reminisce, if I could, with the \nSenator from Wyoming. When we talk numbers, we talk people. If we do \nnot believe our actions here and if the President does not believe his \nactions have consequences on people, then we are not thinking very \nstraight.\n  We watched the stock market bounce around this week as the Congress \nand the President tried to come to a budget agreement. While the stock \nmarket is a reaction of people, it is also a barometer of the economy \nand how people think the economy will work. The economy in our country \nclearly translates to jobs and incomes, spendable incomes, and the \nsecurity of a home and a family and food on the table--and it always \nhas.\n  What we are talking about in a balanced budget and a tax cut is 32 \nbillion dollars' worth of real, disposable income. That is family \nincome. That is food on the table. That is a college education. Mr. \nPresident, $66.2 billion of consumer expenditure, that is what the \nstock market was reacting to yesterday.\n  My time is up. Let me close.\n  Mr. President, our actions have consequences and a balanced budget \nand a tax cut going with it create the kind of economic vitality in \nthis country that is good for people, working people, families, income, \nsecurity.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. EXON. How much time do I have remaining, Mr. President?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 1 minute and 12 seconds.\n  Mr. EXON. I understand there is some talk about a unanimous consent \nagreement to extend the time. Does the manager on the other side know \nabout this?\n  Mr. MACK. I was under the impression what we were going to do was to \nhave the vote at 11 o'clock; we were not extending the time on the \ndebate.\n  Mr. EXON. I think that would be the best of all worlds. Let me \nconclude, then, on the remainder of the time that I have.\n  Despite the temptation that has been offered me by those on the other \nside, trying to bait this Senator into rancorous political discussions, \nI said at the outset that was not my goal. I just received a call from \nLeon Panetta, the Chief of Staff. Some progress has been made. We are \ngoing to have a meeting at 1 o'clock today and another meeting at 5 \no'clock. Then the chief negotiators on the Senate side, Democrat and \nRepublican, will make presentations of how well we are going forward to \nthe White House in the morning, as I understand it, in front of the big \nfive.\n  We are trying to move things along. So, despite the baiting, I am not \ngoing to become involved in a partisan debate at this time to pick each \nother apart. This is a time to come together, and I hope, if we extend \nthe time for the vote, we do not extend the debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired. The \nSenator from Florida.\n  Mr. MACK. Mr. President, again I state it is my intention to conclude \nthe debate. I believe we are extending the time for the vote to \naccommodate Members of the Senate, but I do not see any need to \ncontinue the debate.\n\n  Mr. President, let me close then with my remarks in asking the Senate \nto support the resolution that is before us. As I said a moment ago, it \nis unfortunate the Senate would have to spend this time to remind the \nPresident of a commitment that he made over 30 days ago.\n  I can remember the excitement that occurred when there was an \nagreement on the part of the President to a 7-year balanced budget \nscored by the Congressional Budget Office, thinking that that really \nset us on the road toward an agreement. We have now seen, again, over \n30 days go by and the administration has failed to put forward a budget \nthat balances in 7 years.\n  Several speakers on the other side spoke about the failure to have a \ncontinuing resolution. Frankly, I believe the House has failed to \nprovide a continuing resolution because they have looked at the actions \non the part of the administration and, based on what they perceived \ntheir promises to be over 30 days ago, they in fact feel that they were \nfooled. One of the things that people have learned over the years is, \nif you get fooled one time, you do not fall for the same trick a second \ntime. So the House has said they want to see a balanced budget before \nthey extend Government activities.\n  There is, in fact, a fundamental difference between our approach and \nthat of our colleagues on the other side of the aisle. Our first \nobjective is getting a balanced budget. Then Government will proceed. \nTheir first concern is getting Government to move forward and then we \nwill discuss a balanced budget. To us, the No. 1 concern is balancing \nthe budget.\n  The reason we are concerned is because we think that as a result of \nthat balanced budget, everyone in America will have greater \nopportunities--greater opportunities for jobs, there will be more \nbusinesses created, we will see interest rates come down, we will see \nlower payments on mortgages, on automobile loans, on student loans and \nso \n\n[[Page S19032]]\nforth. America's opportunity will be tremendous if we can just get to \nthe point where we agree that we should not spend more than we are \ntaking in, that we ought to let hard working men and women keep more of \ntheir earned income.\n  There were some remarks made with respect to corporate welfare. It is \ninteresting, my colleagues on the other side of the aisle talk about \nthe moneys earned by individuals and corporations as if it were the \nGovernment's and we were going to decide how much they get to keep of \ntheir money, as opposed to the other way around.\n  I yield whatever time I have.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired. The \nSenator from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAIG. May I inquire where the Senate is at this moment, with the \ntime having expired?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senate is \nsupposed to adopt the amendment of the Senator from South Dakota and \nthen proceed to an immediate vote on the resolution.\n  The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. MACK. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the vote occur on \nadoption of House Joint Resolution 132 at 11 a.m.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, I would like \nto agree with my colleague on this. I would like to offer a substitute \nby asking unanimous consent that the vote occur on the adoption of \nHouse Joint Resolution 132 at 11 a.m., with the time between now and 11 \na.m. equally divided as in morning business, with the time remaining on \nthis side under the control of the Senator from North Dakota.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. MACK. Mr. President, reserving the right to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. MACK. I suggest to my colleague that we just, since there seems \nto be some interest in this issue, since we are going to have the vote \nat 11, that we now just continue the debate with time equally divided.\n  Mr. EXON. No objection. Whatever you want.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Who yields time? The Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, how much time do I have remaining under my \ncontrol, under the new arrangement?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska has 9 minutes and 40 \nseconds.\n  Mr. EXON. How much?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Nine minutes and 40 seconds.\n  Mr. EXON. I yield 9 minutes and forty seconds to the Senator from \nNorth Dakota, with his allotment to any other Senators on our side \nwishing to speak out of that time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota is recognized \nfor 9 minutes and 33 seconds.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I appreciate the Senator from Nebraska \nproviding me the time. If it is the intent of some on the other side \nwho want to speak in the middle of this, I would be happy to \naccommodate that as well. I know the Senator from Idaho is waiting to \nspeak. I will speak for a couple of minutes, and then I would be happy \nto let the Senator from Idaho speak, after which I would like to \nreclaim the balance of the time.\n  Mr. President, as I was listening to the debate this morning, it \noccurred to me that it is time, on December 21, to turn down the volume \njust a bit on the discussion that has been held on these budget issues, \nespecially on the floor of the Senate and here in Washington. It is \nappropriate for us to be struggling to find a way to put this puzzle \ntogether. The pieces do not always seem to fit just right. It has been \ndifficult to find a way to put it together to make it work.\n  On the other side, we hear that they say the top priority is a \nbalanced budget. It is a priority. I have said two or three times--let \nme say again this morning--that I give the majority party credit for \npushing for the balanced budget. They deserve credit for that. But it \nis only one of the goals. Let us balance the budget and at the same \ntime protect other important priorities. In other words, let us balance \nthe budget and do it the right way. If one says the only goal we have \nis to balance the budget, you fall short, it seems to me. Balance the \nbudget, and do it the right way.\n  As we struggle to do this the right way by cutting spending, \nprotecting Medicare and Medicaid, and trying to make sure those who are \nvulnerable in this country are not going to be hurt, I ask that as we \nsort through the menu of how we get to a balanced budget that we do it \nthoughtfully. And at the end of the day when people turn the page on \nthe plan, if there is a plan that is agreed to--and I hope there is--\nthat you do not come to a page that says, ``Wait a second. What is \nthis? What is this deal? Who put this in? Why on Earth would this be \npart of the plan?''\n  The plan was passed here that balanced the budget. It includes a \nlittle thing called repeal of 956(A). I will bet there are not four \npeople here in Congress who know what this meant or what it did or why \nit was done. I do not know whether the other Members on the Senate \nfloor know about the repeal of section 956(A). It is only $244 million.\n  So when I say only in the scheme of the billions of dollars that are \nput into these agreements, $244 million probably does not seem like \nmuch to somebody who wrote this. What is repeal of Section 956(A)? It \nsays to U.S. companies which have moved their jobs overseas--\nmanufacturing plants that might have been closed in America and moved \nthe jobs overseas--that we will give you a tax break to do that and we \nwill make the tax break even a little more generous by about $244 \nmillion by repealing section 956(A). If anybody thinks there is a \nreason to make it more attractive to move American jobs overseas at \ntaxpayer expense, about $244 million, I would like to hear the reason \nfor that.\n  I only use this as an example of the things that are in a plan that, \nin my judgment, does not make sense. Let us decide that we will put a \nplan together that balances the budget, score it with the Congressional \nBudget Office and do it in 7 years, but do it in a way that all of us \ncan go home and talk to people and say, ``We protected Medicare. We \nprotected Medicaid. We are not going to hurt the vulnerable people in \nthis program. We will protect programs that make this a better place.''\n  If we can do all of that, then we will have succeeded in doing \nsomething important for the future of this country. The difference, it \nseems to me, is that for the moment someone on the other side says we \nhave only one goal and that is balance the budget. You need to expand \nthat to a goal of balancing the budget while protecting the things that \nare important and are priorities to our country.\n  I understand the Senator from Idaho has a time constraint. If you do \nnot mind, I will relinquish the floor with the intention of reclaiming \nthe floor when the Senator from Idaho is completed.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. MACK. Mr. President, I yield 3 minutes to the Senator from Idaho.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I thank my colleague for yielding.\n  Let me respond in part to the Senator that has just spoken because so \nmany have been arguing for so long. Balancing the budget is fine. I \nhappen to be one of those who for well over a decade has argued that \nthis country must come to grips with its spending habits, that we are \nindebting a future generation in such a dramatic way that the \nconsequences will be incalculable.\n  Now, there is an interesting drumbeat down at the White House amongst \nsome who, while they will argue they support a balanced budget by \nconcept, say let us do so without any consideration of tax cuts. The \nSenator happened to suggest one that is offered. I think he is right. \nFew would know all the details of that particular tax cut, but there is \none thing that becomes very clear in the whole of what we try to do \nwith a balanced budget.\n  To reduce Federal spending alone--because Federal spending has become \nsuch a very large part of the U.S. economy--does, in fact, have \neconomic consequences that in part can become negative unless there is \nan appropriate stimulus on the other side that balances it out so that \nyou get accelerated \n\n[[Page S19033]]\ngrowth in the private sector, the job-creating kind of stimulus that \noffsets some of that expenditure. And I happen to think that it is a \nmore positive kind of expenditure if it is going on out in the private \nsector and not necessarily money being taken from the private sector \nfunneled through the public sector and allowing us to decide how it \ngets spent.\n  There is no doubt that a pure pattern of spending reductions by \nGovernment with no consideration for economic stimulus on the outside--\nby recognizing some capital gains, by assuredly recognizing the ability \nof the individual wealth-creating, job-holding family to properly \ninvest and to have more money to spend--might not have the right kind \nof economic consequences in the macro sense of the economy.\n  That is why we have tried to couple some tax cuts along with it to \nmiddle and lower income Americans and to some of the economic job-\ngenerating sectors of our country to create positive stimulus all the \nway around. There are few economists that will disagree with what I \nhave just said; that as you offset one side of the overall large \neconomy of Government, you have to stimulate the other. That is exactly \nwhat we are trying to do at this moment.\n  I have spoken enough on this. I think it is important that we talk \nabout linking the two together. Balancing the budget is something I \nhave strongly supported, and will, but let us also talk about the value \nof leaving money in the private sector and stimulating it for economic \ngrowth purposes and job creation.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I want to continue this discussion because \nI think it is a good discussion. I have enormous respect for the \nSenator from Idaho. He has been faithful to the issue of wanting to \nbalance the budget. He and I would disagree as to whether it makes \nsense to propose a very significant tax cut at the same time you are \ntrying to balance the budget. I happen to think first things first: cut \nspending and balance the budget. When you are done with that job, then \nturn to the Tax Code and talk about cuts for those who need it.\n  Every time I hear someone, especially on the other side, talk about a \nstimulating tax cut, I always look at who they are stimulating. The \nwrong people get stimulated. It is interesting to me that the changes \nthat the majority party would propose in their plan on the earned \nincome tax credit--I do not think there is any great dispute about \nthis--would result in a higher tax burden than is now experienced by \nmany Americans, millions of Americans who earn less than $30,000 a \nyear.\n  So if one is stimulating some of the folks in this country who have \nthe largest incomes but saying to those who have $20,000 or $15,000 in \nincome, ``By the way, the stimulus does not work for you, you are going \nto have to pay a little more in taxes,'' I say, ``Gee, I think those \nfolks might want to be stimulated a while by the majority party as \nwell.''\n  I would like to yield for just a moment for a point that the Senator \nfrom New Mexico wants to make, Senator Bingaman.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I did want to ask the Senator from North \nDakota a question. He referred to the old phrase ``first things \nfirst,'' and I have tried to read Peter Drucker and Steven Coffey and \nsome of these people who advise us on proper management procedures, and \nthey all make that same point--first things first. It seems to me the \nfirst thing we ought to be doing in this Congress is to be passing a \ncontinuing resolution to fund the Government.\n  My question relates to an article that is in the morning paper where \nit says, ``GOP Pledges to Pay Furloughed Workers.'' It says, \n``Congressional Republican leaders promised yesterday that the 260,000 \nFederal workers idled by the budget battle would eventually actually be \npaid for their days they are furloughed.''\n  Then it goes on to say, ``At a GOP meeting yesterday, House Speaker \nNewt Gingrich persuaded party members to agree to pay employees for \ndays missed. The employees are losing about $40 million a day in wages, \naccording to the administration.''\n  The question I get most from people in my State is, if you promise to \npay these people, why not send them to work? It is one thing to charge \nthe taxpayers $40 million a day for their services--and you can argue \nwhether that ought to be done or not if you do not like the \nGovernment--but why are we paying people and not letting them work? It \njust does not make any sense to the people I represent.\n  It seems to me that this place is becoming more Alice in Wonderland \nevery day, and that is a classic example. If the Senator has a comment \non that, I would be interested in hearing it.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I heard Ted Koppel ask one of the Members \nof the House last evening twice the same question: What kind of \nleverage are you getting if you say to Federal workers you cannot come \nto work but we will pay you anyway? Are you not just penalizing \ntaxpayers? What kind of leverage do you think you are getting with \nthat?\n  He asked the question twice, and, of course, there is not an answer \nfor it. It is a case of someone having an argument with their relative \nand deciding, well, I am angry at my uncle here who I just had an \nargument with. I think I will walk across the street and punch my \nneighbor.\n  What sense does it make to suggest the Government ought to be shut \ndown so the American taxpayer can pay Federal workers who are not \nallowed to come to work? That just makes no sense to me at all. And \nthat is first things first. The Senator from New Mexico is correct. We \nought to pass a clean funding resolution, a funding bill right now, \nwithin 20 minutes have those people come back to work, and at least \nsolve that issue first.\n  But, second, then we ought to go to the balanced budget amendment. I \nam hopeful that these talks at the White House will bear some fruit. I \ndo not believe I have the time to continue to talk about how you get to \na balanced budget.\n  How much time is remaining, Mr. President?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 29 seconds.\n  Mr. DORGAN. But I was going to make the point about those who say, \nhere is the menu, including all kinds of special little deals. Let us \ngive a $7 million tax cut each to 2,000 corporations by changing the \nalternative minimum tax--a $7 million check to 2,000 corporations. And \nI am asking myself--I happen to think we ought to balance the budget--\nis this the way we ought to balance it?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. MACK addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. MACK. The time remaining, please.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 6 minutes 30 seconds.\n  Mr. MACK. I yield 6 minutes to the Senator from New Hampshire.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire is recognized \nfor 6 minutes.\n  Mr. GREGG. I thank the Senator from Florida.\n  I rise in support of the resolution. I guess the real question here \nis why we have reached the point where we need this resolution, which \nonce again states that we want to have a balanced budget in 7 years and \nthat we want to use CBO figures.\n  The reason we have arrived at this point is because there has been an \ninconsistency from the administration, specifically from the President, \nas to what his position is on a balanced budget, as to what his \nposition is on a timeframe for a balanced budget, as to what his \nposition is on how we will account for getting to a balanced budget.\n  We have had four different budgets sent up here by this \nadministration. Not one of them has been in balance. Every one of them \nhas been rejected by their own party within this Senate, if not on a \nformal vote, at least informally, a couple at least with formal votes, \nand we have an administration which has one day been in favor of a \nwelfare reform bill which was passed by this Senate and then a few days \nlater been opposed to the welfare reform bill passed by the Senate. We \nhave an administration, the chief spokesman of which on health care, \nthe wife of the President, has said that she wants to see a rate of \ngrowth in Medicare at 6 to 7 percent and the President in the same \nbasic timeframe excoriating Republicans because we have proposed a rate \n\n\n[[Page S19034]]\nof growth in health care, in Medicare, which is 6 or 7 percent.\n  The inconsistency that comes forth from this administration is \nconsistent. That is about the only consistent thing about this \nadministration--its inconsistency.\n  So we are once again calling on the administration to commit to what \nwe thought they committed to 3 or 4 weeks ago but which they have \nbacked off of, which is to balance the budget in 7 years and use CBO \nfigures.\n  We have heard a lot of discussion about why this is important, but I \njust want to reiterate that unless you look at the issue of how you are \nbalancing the budget off the same baseline, unless everybody is looking \nat the same numbers, you can never get to any agreement assuming an \nagreement is possible. But there is a big issue here also, and that is \nthat the few times we have been able to get any definitive direction \nout of the White House, it has become very clear that there are some \ndeep philosophical differences between the two parties.\n  We believe that borrowing from our children to pay for the costs of \noperating the Government today is wrong, that it is fundamentally \nwrong. I heard the Senator from North Dakota talk about the vulnerable \npeople in our society. Who is more vulnerable than our children, people \nwho are being asked, even though they do not have any ability to \nconfirm this decision, to take on the debt which our generation is \nrunning up? We have, as Republicans, said this is not right, and \ntherefore we put together a real budget that reaches balance in 7 \nyears.\n  Second, we have said you cannot run a system to assist our senior \ncitizens if we know the system is going to go bankrupt in 7 years. We \nhave been told by the trustees of the Medicare trust fund that it goes \nbankrupt in 7 years unless something is done, and so we have stood up \nand made a proposal which puts that system into solvency.\n  We have done it in a way which gives seniors more choices than they \nhave today, which gives seniors the same options essentially as Members \nof Congress in choosing their health care. We have done it by using the \nmarketplace.\n  We have further said that if you have a welfare system which says to \npeople, you can stay on welfare all your life and then you can have \nyour children on welfare, whether they are legitimate or illegitimate, \nand they can have their children on welfare, that is wrong; that people \nshould not be on welfare for the remainder of their existence in this \ncountry but they should be asked to participate in the system of \nproductivity which creates the ability to benefit those who are in \nneed, and it is called work.\n  So we have proposed under our welfare proposal that people be \nrequired to go to work after a reasonable amount of time, 2 years, and \nafter 5 years of being on welfare they not be any longer a charge to \nthe State but be required to be out in society being a productive \ncitizen.\n  These goals which we have--balancing the budget so that our children \ndo not get the bills for this time but have an opportunity in their \ntime to be successful; creating a Medicare system which is, first of \nall, solvent and, second of all, gives our seniors the same choices in \nthe marketplace as citizens who are in the private sector; which allows \na welfare system which is really directed at caring for the people who \nneed support, not for the people who are abusing and using the system--\nthese basic goals which we have put forward have been essentially \nrejected by this administration. They have either been rejected out of \nhand or they have been rejected in indirect ways through the \nmanipulation of the numbers or the proposals that they have brought \nforward.\n  Underlying this administration's basic philosophy there appears to be \na goal, or maybe it is their philosophy that is the goal, and it is \ncalled reelection. That is what is driving the basic decisions which we \nhear from the White House. There is no desire for substantive change \nfor the purposes of improving the Medicare system or improving the \nMedicare system and getting our Government into balance. There does \nappear, however, to be a substantive drive for reelection. And that \ndrive for reelection has caused this administration to time and again \nput forward proposals which are superficial, inconsistent.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Time has expired.\n  Mr. GREGG. I thank the Chair for noting that. I will just simply wrap \nup by saying if we are going to accomplish a balanced budget, we have \nto get this administration to agree to a balanced budget, to do it in 7 \nyears, to do it with CBO figures, and to do it by addressing the \nspending that the Government is presently involved in.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has expired.\n  Mr. MACK. Have the yeas and nays been ordered?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. They have not been.\n  Mr. MACK. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There is a \nsufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senate adopts \nthe amendment of the Senator from South Dakota, Senator Daschle.\n  So the amendment (No. 3108) was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on the engrossment of the \namendment and third reading of the joint resolution.\n  The amendment was ordered to be engrossed, and the joint resolution \nto be read a third time.\n  The joint resolution was read a third time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The joint resolution having been read the \nthird time, the question is, Shall the joint resolution pass?\n  The yeas and nays have been ordered. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. LOTT. I announce that the Senator from Texas [Mr. Gramm], the \nSenator from Indiana [Mr. Coats], and the Senator from Delaware [Mr. \nRoth] are necessarily absent.\n  I also announce that the Senator from Missouri [Mr. Ashcroft] is \nabsent due to a death in the family.\n  I further announce that, if present and voting, the Senator from \nMissouri [Mr. Ashcroft] would vote ``yea.''\n  Mr. FORD.

Mr. President, I understand the veto message with \nrespect to the securities litigation bill has arrived from the House.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct. \n  \n[[Page S19035]]\n\n  Mr. BENNETT. I ask unanimous consent that the veto message be \nconsidered as having been read and it be printed in the Record and \nspread in full upon the Journal.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER laid before the Senate a message from the \nPresident of the United States to the House of Representatives, as \nfollows:\n\nTo the House of Representatives:\n  I am returning herewith without my approval H.R. 1058, the ``Private \nSecurities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.'' This legislation is \ndesigned to reform portions of the Federal securities laws to end \nfrivolous lawsuits and to ensure that investors receive the best \npossible information by reducing the litigation risk to companies that \nmake forward-looking statements.\n  I support those goals. Indeed, I made clear my willingness to support \nthe bill passed by the Senate with appropriate ``safe harbor'' \nlanguage, even though it did not include certain provisions that I \nfavor--such as enhanced provisions with respect to joint and several \nliability, aider and abettor liability, and statute of limitations.\n  I am not however, willing to sign legislation that will have the \neffect of closing the courthouse door on investors who have legitimate \nclaims. Those who are the victims of fraud should have recourse in our \ncourts. Unfortunately, changes made in this bill during conference \ncould well prevent that.\n  This country is blessed by strong and vibrant markets and I believe \nthat they function best when corporations can raise capital by \nproviding investors with their best good-faith assessment of future \nprospects, without fear of costly, unwarranted litigation. But I also \nknow that our markets are as strong and effective as they are because \nthey operate--and are seen to operate--with integrity. I believe that \nthis bill, as modified in conference, could erode this crucial basis of \nour markets' strength.\n  Specifically, I object to the following elements of this bill. First, \nI believe that the pleading requirements of the Conference Report with \nregard to a defendant's state of mind impose an unacceptable procedural \nhurdle to meritorious claims being heard in Federal courts. I am \nprepared to support the high pleading standard of the U.S. Court of \nAppeals for the Second Circuit--the highest pleading standard of any \nFederal circuit court. But the conferees make crystal clear in the \nStatement of Managers their intent to raise the standard even beyond \nthat level. I am not prepared to accept that.\n  The conferees deleted an amendment offered by Senator Specter and \nadopted by the Senate that specifically incorporated Second Circuit \ncase law with respect to pleading a claim of fraud. Then they \nspecifically indicated that they were not adopting Second Circuit case \nlaw but instead intended to ``strengthen'' the existing pleading \nrequirements of the Second Circuit. All this shows that the conferees \nmeant to erect a higher barrier to bringing suit than any now \nexisting--one so high that even the most aggrieved investors with the \nmost painful losses may get tossed out of court before they have a \nchance to prove their case.\n  Second, while I support the language of the Conference Report \nproviding a ``safe harbor'' for companies that include meaningful \ncautionary statements in their projections of earnings, the Statement \nof Managers--which will be used by courts as a guide to the intent of \nthe Congress with regard to the meaning of the bill--attempts to weaken \nthe cautionary language that the bill itself requires. Once again, the \nend result may be that investors find their legitimate claims unfairly \ndismissed.\n  Third, the Conference Report's Rule 11 provision lacks balance, \ntreating plaintiffs more harshly than defendants in a manner that comes \ntoo close to the ``loser pays'' standard I oppose.\n  I want to sign a good bill and I am prepared to do exactly that if \nthe Congress will make the following changes to this legislation: \nfirst, adopt the Second Circuit pleading standards and reinsert the \nSpecter amendment into the bill. I will support a bill that submits all \nplaintiffs to the tough pleading standards of the Second Circuit, but I \nam not prepared to go beyond that. Second, remove the language in the \nStatement of Managers that waters down the nature of the cautionary \nlanguage that must be included to make the safe harbor safe. Third, \nrestore the Rule 11 language to that of the Senate bill.\n\n  While it is true that innocent companies are hurt by frivolous \nlawsuits and that valuable information may be withheld from investors \nwhen companies fear the risk of such suits, it is also true that there \nare innocent investors who are defrauded and who are able to recover \ntheir losses only because they can go to court. It is appropriate to \nchange the law to ensure that companies can make reasonable statements \nand future projections without getting sued every time earnings turn \nout to be lower than expected or stock prices drop. But it is not \nappropriate to erect procedural barriers that will keep wrongly injured \npersons from having their day in court.\n  I ask the Congress to send me a bill promptly that will put an end to \nlitigation abuses while still protecting the legitimate rights of \nordinary investors. I will sign such a bill as soon as it reaches my \ndesk.\n                                                  William J. Clinton.  \n  The White House, December 19, 1995.\n\n  The Senate proceeded to reconsider the bill (H.R. 1058) to reform \nFederal securities litigation, and for other purposes, returned to the \nHouse by the President on December 19, 1995, with his objections, and \npassed by the House of Representatives, on reconsideration, on December \n20, 1995.\n  The question is, Shall the bill pass, the objection of the President \nof the United States to the contrary notwithstanding? Who yields time?\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, we had a long, I think, careful and \nreasoned debate on this issue. It passed the Senate by a very \nsubstantial margin, indeed by a margin, which, if it had been the final \nvote, would have been sufficient to override a Presidential veto.\n  I am not sure what purpose will be served by our spending a great \ndeal of time repeating the arguments that were made, but I am sure we \nwill. The procedure and tradition in the Senate being what it is, we \nwill go over this one more time.\n\n  I believe the President has made a mistake in vetoing this bill. I \nbelieve the House of Representatives has made the right decision in \noverriding the veto. I know the bill has been characterized as an issue \nbetween investors and corporations. The President, in his veto message, \nindicated that he was going to strike a blow for the investors.\n  Mr. President, I need to point out once more, perhaps, that the \nowners of corporations are the investors, and anything which damages \nthe economic health of the corporation damages the investors who place \ntheir money in that corporation. Anything that prohibits the \ncorporations' ability to earn a return on investment damages the \ninvestors who are seeking that return on investment.\n  I find it difficult to understand, therefore, those who say that we \nare going to help investors by supporting activities which damage the \nprofitability of the corporation in which the investors have placed \ntheir money.\n  The key provisions of this bill are proinvestor provisions. I think \nthe most significant provision of this bill is the one that allows the \ninvestors to determine who will prosecute the lawsuit when a class \naction suit is brought. Let me illustrate the importance of that, Mr. \nPresident, with an example that is admittedly overdrawn, but we need to \noverdraw these issues because some people do not seem to understand \nthem when they are not overdrawn.\n  Let us assume that the ABC Corp. has 100 shares outstanding; let us \nassume that one investor has purchased one of those shares, and another \ninvestor has purchased the other 99. When a class action suit is \nbrought, it is brought on behalf of all members of the class. In the \ncircumstance I have just described, there are two members of the \nclass--the class being the investors: One who has one share, the other \nwho has 99 shares. If a class action suit is brought by the investor \nwho has one share and the effect of that class action suit is to damage \nthe ability of that corporation to perform, who is most damaged by the \nsuit? It is the shareholder who owns the other 99 shares.\n  Yet the way the thing is structured now, the shareholder who owns one \nshare can bring a class action suit on behalf of the entire class, and \nif he gets \n\n[[Page S19036]]\nto the courtroom first, he is determined to be the lead plaintiff in \nthis suit. Now, the investor who owns the 99 shares sits down with him \nand says, ``Sam, this is stupid. This is going to damage the \ncorporation. This is going to damage all of us.''\n  Sam smiles sweetly at Joe and says, ``Joe, what is it worth to you to \nget me to drop my suit?''\n  Joe says, ``Well, Sam, you know you will lose if we get in court.''\n  And Sam says ``Joe, that's not the point. What's it worth to you?''\n  Sam says, ``It will cost the corporation a million dollars to defend \nagainst your suit.''\n  Joe says, ``Fine, offer me half a million and I go away.''\n  It is blackmail, Mr. President, pure and simple.\n  So Joe finally says, ``OK, Sam, here is your $500,000. Drop your \nsuit.''\n  Sam takes his $500,000 and he goes away until the next time.\n  I have told this story before. I have to repeat it again because I \nthink it is an important part of the point I am trying to make. We are \noften told here, ``No, the only reason lawsuits are settled out of \ncourt is when the management has something to hide.'' Well, the story I \nam about to tell you is a real story. It really happened. It happened \nto my father. He served here in the Senate for some 24 years. When he \nretired from the Senate he was not ready to retire from life so he got \nhimself another life and another series of activities. One of them was \nserving on boards of directors. He was on a number of boards. Some were \ncharitable, some were nonprofit, some were very much profit.\n  On one of the boards he served, he would go to the board meetings and \ntake his duty seriously--as my father always did--and then one day he \nreceived a stack of papers in the mail notifying him that he was being \nsued. The suit was made out to Wallace F. Bennett, et al., and the suit \nwas claiming all kinds of things. My father looked through this. He was \nquite disturbed. It became clear to him that the ``et al.'' in this \ncase were the other directors of the corporation. He called the legal \ndivision of the corporation whose board he was serving on and said, \n``What is this all about?\"\n  The lawyer said to him ``Oh, don't worry about that, Mr. Bennett. The \nreason you are named is because the directors are listed alphabetically \nand ``B'' comes before the letters of any of the other directors so \nthey are suing you and all of the directors, but it is just a \ncoincidence that your name comes first, that you are named in the suit. \nThe entire board is being sued.''\n  Dad said, ``That is a little bit of comfort, but what are we being \nsued for? What did we do wrong?''\n  Well, the lawyer says ``You raised your salary.''\n  Dad said, ``Pardon me?''\n  And he said, ``Well, remember, the way this thing is structured, the \ncompensation of the directors are tied to the profitability of the \norganization. So when the organization makes more money the directors' \ncompensation goes up.''\n  Dad says, ``That is logical. That is proper. What is the basis of the \nsuit?''\n  ``There is a lawyer in New York who watches this, and whenever the \ncompensation of the directors goes up for whatever reason, he \nautomatically files a lawsuit against us claiming that the directors \nare looting the proceeds and assets of the corporation for their own \nprofit.''\n  Dad said, ``Well, that lawsuit is absolutely absurd. It is sound \nbusiness practice to tie the directors' compensation to the \nprofitability of the company. That means the directors will take the \nactions that will make the company more profitable.''\n  ``Don't worry about it, Senator, this lawyer knows he will never win \nhis suit. He knows we will never spend the money to take him to court. \nIt would cost us about $500,000 to prosecute this suit and take him to \ncourt and win and it is cheaper for us to send him a $100,000 check to \nsettle this.''\n  So every time this happens, that is, there is a change in the \ncompensation of the directors, he files the suit, we send him a \n$100,000 check, he goes away and the problem is solved. That is exactly \nwhat happened. They sent the lawyer a $100,000 check, he dropped his \nsuit, and everybody went forward.\n  My father was outraged. But they told him, ``Senator, you can be as \noutraged as you want to be, but our alternative is to prosecute this \nlawsuit, take him to court, beat him in court, see a $500,000 legal \nbill run up in the process. The logical thing for us to do for the \nshareholders, the investors, if you will, is to pay him his $100,000, \nand hope he will go away.''\n  Now, my father was pleased when another member joined the board whose \nlast name began with an ``A'' because then the papers were always filed \non the new director rather than my father, but again and again they \nsent the $100,000 bribe money off to the lawyer in New York who had \nhimself a really wonderful legal practice. All he had to do was file \nthese papers and collect his check. There was no merit whatever in his \nclaim and he knew it and everybody else knew it.\n  There is an end to this story that I kind of like. The lawyer decided \nto expand his practice and he started suing other companies besides the \none of which my father served as a director. One of the companies he \ndecided to sue was owned by Merrill Lynch, and the Merrill Lynch \nlawyers looked at this and decided the time has come to put an end to \nit and we have deep enough pockets that we can take this man to court \nand ruin him in his legal costs, trying to defend himself.\n  So the system that had worked for the lawyer in the one circumstance \nthen turned against him. Merrill Lynch said, ``Whatever it takes in \nlegal costs, it takes, but we are going to put a stop to this, force \nthis man to go to court and force him to defend his position.'' And \nthey ultimately did put a stop to it because when he was faced with \nactually proving his position in a court of law and running up the \ncosts connected with that kind of litigation, the lawyer was finally \nforced to back down.\n  I tell this story because I want to lay to rest, once and for all, \nthe canard that is raised on the other side of this issue by those who \nsay that by passing this legislation we are damaging investors for the \nbenefit of big corporations. The investors in the company where my \nfather served as a director were benefited by the actions of Merrill \nLynch and their legal department when they finally stepped in. They \nwould be benefited by the passage of this legislation, and Merrill \nLynch investors would be benefited by the fact that Merrill Lynch would \nno longer have to spend that kind of money to clean up that sort of an \noutrage.\n  If you want to vote on behalf of the investors, you vote for the \noverride of the President's veto of this bill.\n  I was sorry to hear that the President had vetoed. We were told \ninformally on the floor when the bill was passed that the President \nwould probably sign it. We were told that the President and the people \nadvising him understood that this was proinvestor legislation and the \nPresident, obviously, wants to position himself as being proinvestor.\n  I was also told by those who watch these kinds of things that the \nPresident would probably sign it because this legislation is very, very \nimportant in Silicon Valley. The companies that have been the target of \nthese frivolous lawsuits are primarily located in the high-technology \nindustry, and Silicon Valley in California is considered the seed bed \nof high technology in this country.\n  I might, in a parochial way, Mr. President, note that there are more \nsoftware companies in Utah Valley than there are in Silicon Valley, but \nthat is a parochial comment made by the Senator from Utah.\n  Why would it be important for the President to sign a bill that would \nbenefit Silicon Valley? One need only look at the political map and the \nnumber of electoral votes that are contained in California to realize \nthat anything that improves the California economy would be of \npolitical benefit to a politician who could take credit for improving \nthe California economy. The California delegation as a whole has been \nmost vigorous in their support of this bill. The senior Senator from \nCalifornia [Mrs. Feinstein] has been a supporter of this bill. But the \nPresident decided, apparently, that whatever political benefit would \naccrue to him by doing something that would be good for Silicon Valley \nmight be offset by his ability to pose as the defender of the small \ninvestor.\n  There have been many editorials written by people who perhaps do not \n\n[[Page S19037]]\n  understand this bill, to say, no, this really does support the small \ninvestor, and the President decided to go with that rhetoric rather \nthan with what I consider to be the true substantive benefit of this \nbill.\n  So we are back again. We have gone through this argument in \ncommittee. The bill was reported out of committee by a strong \nbipartisan margin. We are back into it here on the floor. As indicated, \nthe bill was passed by the Senate by a strong bipartisan margin. It has \ngone through the House. The override vote was 319 to 100, more than 3 \nto 1. It needed only be 2 to 1, but it was more than 3 to 1. So that \nmakes it very clear there is a strong bipartisan message here.\n  I am interested that the authorship of this bill began on the \nDemocratic side of the aisle with Senator Dodd, joined on the \nRepublican side of the aisle by Senator Domenici. It was known as the \nDodd-Domenici bill in the previous Congress. Now, given the results of \nthe election, it is called the Domenici-Dodd bill. But it demonstrates \nthe bipartisan nature, rising above partisan bickering, that has marked \nthis entire effort. The effort has taken years, and in the years since \nSenator Dodd began his crusade to get this problem fixed, there have \nbeen millions, if not hundreds of millions of dollars wasted, investor \ndollars wasted in dealing with these frivolous lawsuits. If this veto \nis upheld, there will be millions, if not hundreds of millions of \ndollars wasted in the future.\n\n  This legislation will ultimately pass. It will ultimately pass \nbecause it is the right thing to do and more and more people recognize \nthat it is the right thing to do. The only question is whether it \nshould pass in this Congress and become law in this year. I believe the \ntime has gone long enough for us to debate this and repeat the \narguments back and forth. The time has come for us to pass this bill.\n  So I hope the Senate will respond, as the House has done, with a \nstrong bipartisan majority to override the President's veto. I \nexpressed my concern that I think the President was misguided by his \nadvisers on this one, both those who advised him on the substance and \nthose who may have advised him on the politics. I hope we will help \ncorrect this Presidential mistake by what we do here on the floor.\n  Mr. President, I could go on and repeat all of the arguments that \nhave been made in committee and on the floor on this issue, but I see \nthe senior Senator from Maryland, who was the ranking member of the \nBanking Committee and who is opposed to this bill, and undoubtedly in \nsupport of the President's veto. He is on the floor, and I will be \nhappy to yield to him for whatever opening statement he might have. \nThen we can go forward from there.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, as I understand it, the distinguished \nSenator from Tennessee would like to address the Senate for a short \nperiod of time. I ask unanimous consent the Senator from Tennessee be \nrecognized, and at the conclusion of his remarks I then be recognized.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Tennessee.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/12/21/senate-section/article/S19034-1", "month": "12", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "21", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S19037]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  THE HOWARD H. BAKER, JR. COURTHOUSE\n\n  Mr. THOMPSON. I thank the Senator from Maryland, and I thank the \nChair.\n  Mr. President, one of the highest honors that I have in serving in \nthe U.S. Senate is the fact that I hold a seat once occupied by Howard \nH. Baker, Jr. I have no doubt that this seat will always be known as \nthe Baker seat, and that is how it should be.\n  This morning I rise and it is my honor to rise in support of the \naction of the Senate taken last night, just prior to adjournment. The \nSenate passed H.R. 2547 to name the new U.S. courthouse in Knoxville, \nTN, in the Senator's beloved east Tennessee, after Senator Baker.\n  I know that the Howard H. Baker, Jr. Courthouse will always serve as \na reminder of the love and respect that all Tennesseans, as well as all \nMembers of this body, have for him.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, let me simply say I am delighted to hear \nthe courthouse has been named for our very able colleague, Howard \nBaker. I did wonder whether Howard Baker would be able to practice law \nin the Howard Baker Courthouse, but I guess that issue can be settled \nwhen the time arises. But it is certainly a recognition that his very \ndistinguished career here in the Senate makes well deserved.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/12/21/senate-section/article/S19037-1", "month": "12", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "21", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S19037-S19060]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 SECURITIES LITIGATION REFORM ACT--VETO\n\n  The Senate continued with the reconsideration of the bill.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, first I want to say that the logic of my \ncolleague from Utah is absolutely right. I think he said right at the \nend of his remarks that I was against the bill and, therefore, he \nassumed that I would be in support of the veto. And he is obviously \ncorrect. I will not now--I may later--talk a bit about the broader \ndefects which I see in the legislation. But I want to address now the \nitems that were touched upon in the President's veto message as the \nbasis for his vetoing the legislation.\n  My own view is that there are other reasons as well that go well \nbeyond what the President indicated. But I want to focus on that for \nthe moment since it is the veto message, the veto, that is before us. \nAnd the issue, of course, would be whether to override the veto.\n  I listened to my distinguished colleague from Utah as he talked, and \nto the various examples that he gave as a reason for why we should pass \nthis legislation in terms of the kinds of suits that had been brought \nand the frivolousness of the actions. And I want to simply say to him \nthat, if that is all the bill did, if the bill were crafted in a way to \nget at the kind of examples he was citing, I think the bill would have \npassed 99-0. So I do not really differ with him in the examples that he \ncited as being problems and saying that those are problems and measures \nought to be taken in order to correct them. The problem is that this \nbill goes way beyond that. That is the problem.\n  The President, since the conference report was passed 2 weeks ago, \nhas now vetoed it. That actually reflects, I think, the overwhelming \nposition taken by newspaper and magazine editors around the country who \nhave analyzed this legislation and who have no vested interest in it. \nThere are a number of interest groups who have an interest on either \nside of this legislation. But these are common indicators outside of \nthat framework. They have by and large strongly come down against it.\n  The President said in his message, ``Those who are victims of fraud \nshould have recourse in our courts. Unfortunately, changes made in this \nbill during conference could well prevent that.''\n  I hope that the Senate will sustain the President's veto so that we \ncould get about the business of crafting legislation better targeted at \nthe goal that I think we all share--deterring frivolous lawsuits. I \nwant to emphasize that again. I know of no one who argues against \nreasoned measures to deter frivolous lawsuits.\n  The President's veto message recognizes that this bill is not a \nbalanced response to the problem of frivolous lawsuits. This \nlegislation will affect far more than frivolous lawsuits. As I said at \nthe outset, if the bill dealt only with the problem of frivolous \nlawsuits, I would be for it, and presumably the President would have \nsigned it.\n  Unfortunately, this bill that is before us will make it more \ndifficult for investors to bring and recover damages in legitimate \nfraud actions. Investors will find it far more difficult to bring and \nto recover damages in legitimate fraud actions.\n  The editors of Money magazine concluded that this legislation hurts \ninvestors, stating in their December editorial as follows: ``Now only \nClinton can stop Congress from hurting small investors like you.'' That \nis Money magazine. The President has tried to do that through the veto. \nWe should do our part now by supporting this veto.\n  The President's message identified three areas of concern with the \nbill: The pleading standard, the safe harbor, and the rule 11 \nprovision. On the first point, the President said, and I quote him: \n``The pleading requirements of the \n\n[[Page S19038]]\nconference report with regard to a defendant's state of mind impose an \nunacceptable procedural hurdle to meritorious claims being heard in \nFederal courts.''--``an unacceptable procedural hurdle to meritorious \nclaims being heard in Federal court.''\n  What are pleading standards? Some of this, of course, gets very \nlawyerly, but it has to get lawyerly because you are really talking \nabout the basis on which people have access to the courts. That may \nappear to be a highly technical legal matter, and in some respects it \nis. But the practical result is very real for people who may have been \ndefrauded or abused in terms of making their investment decisions.\n  Pleading standards refer to what an investor must show in order to \ninitiate a securities fraud lawsuit. In other words, what must you \nestablish in order to get the lawsuit started? The bill that was \nreported by the Senate Banking Committee adopted the pleading standard \nused by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. That standard \nsays that investors seeking to file securities fraud cases must, and I \nquote: ``specifically allege facts giving rise to a strong inference \nthat the defendant acted with the required state of mind.''\n  In other words, the plaintiff in setting out his pleading has to \nspecifically allege facts that give rise to a strong inference that the \ndefendant acted with the required state of mind. This is a standard \nmore stringent than the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. It, in fact, \nis a minority view amongst the circuit courts in terms of the threshold \nthat the plaintiff has to cross in order to initiate a securities fraud \nlawsuit.\n  But that was a standard adopted in the committee, in the committee-\nreported bill. When the bill came to the Senate floor, the Senate \nadopted an amendment to this provision that was offered by the \ndistinguished Senator from Pennsylvania, Senator Specter. Senator \nSpecter's amendment codified, brought into the statute, additional \nsecond circuit holdings clarifying this standard. These additional \nsecond circuit holdings state that a plaintiff may meet the pleading \nstandard by alleging facts showing the defendant had motive and \nopportunity to commit fraud or constituting strong circumstantial \nevidence of state of mind. What the second circuit has done is they \nhave enunciated this holding with respect to pleadings, and then in \nsubsequent opinions they had clarified this standard to make it clear \nthat motive and opportunity to commit fraud, or facts constituting \nstrong circumstantial evidence of a state of mind, would also meet the \npleading standard.\n  The argument made was that, if you are going to take the second \ncircuit standard, then you ought to take the second circuit's \nelaboration of its standard, which seems to me an eminently logical and \nreasonable position.\n  I think it is probably safe to say that the only pro-investor \namendment adopted on the Senate floor was the Specter amendment.\n  I thought it was a constructive contribution to the legislation, and \na majority of this body, I think on a vote of 57 to 42, agreed with \nthat.\n  Unfortunately, this amendment was dropped in conference, the Specter \namendment. The conference report deleted the Specter amendment, leaving \ninvestors without the protection of the additional second circuit \nholdings. And the President in his veto message said the following:\n\n       The conferees deleted an amendment offered by Senator \n     Specter and adopted by the Senate that specifically \n     incorporated Second Circuit case law with respect to pleading \n     a claim of fraud. Then they specifically indicated that they \n     were not adopting Second Circuit case law but instead \n     intended to strengthen the existing pleading requirements of \n     the Second Circuit. All this shows that the conferees meant \n     to erect a higher barrier to bringing suit than any now \n     existing--one so high that even the most aggrieved investors \n     with the most painful losses may get tossed out of court \n     before they have a chance to prove their case.\n\n  Mr. President, I think that President Clinton was well advised to \nobject to that provision of the conference report. A number of eminent \nlaw professors, experts without any axe to grind, wrote to the \nPresident warning of the consequences of that provision.\n  Professor Arthur Miller of the Harvard Law School, a nationally \nrecognized expert on civil procedure, warned that the pleading standard \nadopted in conference, and I quote him, ``effectively will destroy the \nprivate enforcement capacities that have been given to investors to \npolice our Nation's marketplace.''\n  John Sexton, the very able and distinguished dean of the New York \nUniversity School of Law, one of our Nation's preeminent law schools, \nand also an expert on civil procedure, wrote, ``It simply will be \nimpossible for the plaintiff, without discovery, to meet the standard \ninserted by the conference committee at the last minute.'' Let me \nrepeat that from Dean Sexton. ``It simply will be impossible for the \nplaintiff, without discovery, to meet the standard inserted by the \nconference committee at the last minute.''\n  Joel Seligman, dean of the University of Arizona School of Law and an \nexpert in securities law, also expressed concern that the pleading \nstandard would ``prevent a significant number of meritorious lawsuits \nfrom going forward.''\n  These are all very distinguished legal experts, very knowledgeable on \nthis particular area of the law, and all expressing these very strong \njudgments about the impact of what was done in the conference with \nrespect to this issue.\n  I ask unanimous consent that those letters be printed in the Record \nat the end of my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Coverdell). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, sustaining the President's veto would \ngive the Congress a chance to craft a more reasonable pleading \nstandard. This is a very important issue. It may not appear to be so, \nbut the end result of not having a reasonable pleading standard is that \nyou will prevent people with meritorious claims from being able to \ninitiate and carry through their suit. I wish to underscore, I am \ntalking about people with meritorious claims.\n  A reasonable pleading standard, as was in the original proposed bill \nand enhanced by the Specter amendment, would not provide any opening \nfor frivolous lawsuits but it would ensure that meritorious lawsuits \nwere not barred from the courtroom.\n  Let me turn to safe harbor, which, of course, was an issue on which \nthere was extended discussion in this Chamber in the course of the \nconsideration of this legislation and then again on the conference \nreport. The President stated with respect to the safe harbor \nprovision--this is the President in the veto message:\n\n       While I support the language of the conference report \n     providing a ``safe harbor'' for companies that include \n     meaningful cautionary statements in their projections of \n     earnings, the Statement of Managers--which will be used by \n     courts as a guide to the intent of the Congress with regard \n     to the meaning of the bill--attempts to weaken the cautionary \n     language that the bill itself requires. Once again, the end \n     result may be that investors find their legitimate claims \n     unfairly dismissed.\n\n  The safe harbor provision creates a statutory exemption from \nliability for so-called forward-looking statements. Forward-looking \nstatements are broadly defined in the bill to include both oral and \nwritten statements--both oral and written statements. Examples include \nprojections of financial items such as revenues and income for the \nquarter or for the year, estimates of dividends to be paid to \nshareholders, and statements of future economic performance such as \nsales trends and developments of new products. In short, forward-\nlooking statements include the type of information that is important to \ninvestors deciding whether to purchase a particular stock.\n  I differ somewhat with the President on his analysis because I think \nthe safe harbor language in the bill as well as the language in the \nstatement of managers is troublesome. It is my very deep concern that \nthe safe harbor provision in this legislation will, for the first time, \nprotect fraudulent statements under the Federal securities law. The \nAmerican Bar Association wrote the President that the safe harbor ``has \nbeen transformed not simply into a shelter for the reckless but for the \nintentional wrongdoer as well.''\n  Think of that, not simply into a shelter for the reckless but for the \nintentional wrongdoer as well.\n  Projections by corporate insiders will be protected, even though they \nmay be \n\n[[Page S19039]]\nunreasonable, misleading, and fraudulent, if accompanied by boilerplate \ncautionary language.\n  The claim is made that the bill codifies a legal doctrine applied by \nthe courts known as ``bespeaks caution.'' As I understand it, all \ncourts that have applied this doctrine have required that projections \nbe accompanied by disclaimers specifically tailored to the projections. \nIf companies want to immunize their projections, they must alert \ninvestors to the specific risks affecting those projections.\n  In other words, general boilerplate language will not do that. The \nbill before us today does not include--does not include--this \nrequirement of specific cautionary language to investors.\n  The Association of the Bar of the city of New York warned of this \nprovision stating:\n\n       . . . the proposed statutory language, while superficially \n     appearing to track the concepts and standards of the leading \n     cases in this field, in fact radically departs from them and \n     could immunize artfully packaged and intentional \n     misstatements and omissions of known facts.\n\n  Let me just repeat that because the Association of the Bar of the \ncity of New York is a very distinguished organization and they do in-\ndepth studies of important legal issues. Their studies are widely \nrespected and widely referred to in the legal profession.\n  What they warned about in this safe harbor provision was that:\n\n       . . . the proposed statutory language, while superficially \n     appearing to track the concepts and standards of the leading \n     cases in this field, in fact radically departs from them and \n     could immunize artfully packaged and intentional \n     misstatements and omissions of known facts.\n\n  This letter was signed for the bar association by Stephen Friedman, a \nformer SEC Commissioner.\n  Prof. John Coffee, a distinguished professor at the Columbia Law \nSchool, wrote to the President:\n\n       . . . rather than simply codify the emerging `bespeaks \n     caution' doctrine, it is much closer to the truth to say that \n     the Act overrules that doctrine.\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Coffee letter \ndiscussing this issue and another by him be printed in the Record at \nthe conclusion of my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 2.)\n  Mr. SARBANES. While I believe the safe harbor language in this bill \nis a problem, the President in his veto message has raised an \nadditional valid point with respect to the safe harbor language in the \nstatement of managers.\n  The President points out that the language in the statement of \nmanagers attempts to weaken the cautionary language that the bill \nitself requires. The President received advice on this point from \nProfessor Coffee, who wrote:\n\n       . . . under the proposed legislative history there now \n     appears to be no obligation to disclose the most important \n     reasons why the forward-looking statement may prove false.\n\n  And Professor Coffee went on to state:\n\n       . . . no public policy justification can support such \n     selective disclosure of the less important facts while \n     withholding the most important.\n\n  So I have difficulty with the provision in the legislation itself, as \nI have indicated, but on top of that you have this Statement of \nManagers seeking to create legislative interpretation which, as the \nPresident pointed out, attempts to weaken the cautionary language that \nthe bill itself requires.\n  So that a weak provision has been rendered, well, Professor Coffee, I \nguess, would say, nonexistent. He stated earlier:\n\n       . . . rather than simply codify the emerging ``bespeaks \n     caution'' doctrine, it is much closer to the truth to say \n     that the Act overrules that doctrine.\n\n  Sustaining the veto would give the Congress the chance to craft a \nmore reasonable legislative approach on the safe harbor issue.\n  Let me turn to the rule 11 provision. The President's veto message on \nthis matter states:\n\n       . . . The Conference Report's Rule 11 provision lacks \n     balance, treating plaintiffs more harshly than defendants in \n     a manner that comes too close to the ``loser pays'' standard \n     I oppose.\n\n  We had a discussion about this when we dealt with the conference \nreport, I say to my colleagues. When we sent the bill to conference, \nthe way we drafted the bill in the Senate, under Rule 11, we treated \nplaintiffs and defendants evenhandedly with respect to either bringing \nof frivolous suits or asserting a frivolous defense.\n  It is clear to me that that is the way it ought to be done. Rule 11 \nof the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure is the principal sanction \nagainst the filing of frivolous lawsuits in the Federal courts. It \nrequires all cases filed in the Federal courts to be based on \nreasonable legal arguments and supported by the facts. As passed by the \nSenate, the bill required that courts include specific findings in \nsecurities class actions regarding compliance by all parties and \nattorneys with rule 11(b) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.\n  This is as passed by the Senate. If a court found a violation of rule \n11 by the plaintiff or the defendant, the court was required to impose \nsanctions. The provision was balanced. The sanctions would have applied \nequally to plaintiffs and defendants. This was intended as a deterrent \nto frivolous cases. I believe it would have worked well. In conference, \nthis balance was removed so the legislation now applies more harshly to \ninvestors than to corporate insiders.\n  The Senate bill as we passed it contained a presumption that the \nappropriate sanction for failure of the complaint or the responsive \npleading or motion to comply with rule 11 was an award of reasonable \nattorneys fees and other expenses incurred as a direct result of the \nviolation.\n  The conference changed this presumption so it no longer applies \nequally to plaintiffs and defendants. I defy any of my colleagues to \njustify this either in logic or reason. This was a change made by the \nconference so that it no longer applies equally to plaintiffs and \ndefendants. If the defendant substantially violates rule 11, he pays \nonly reasonable attorneys fees and other expenses incurred as a direct \nresult of the violation; this is the standard that was in the Senate-\npassed bill. If the plaintiff is found to have substantially violated \nrule 11, he pays all attorneys fees incurred in the action, not just \nthose resulting from the violation.\n  This is a major and significant disparity. There is no justification \nfor such disparate treatment. Of course, its result will be to scare \ninvestors from bringing meritorious fraud suits. The legal experts \nagree that that will be the result of this provision.\n  Professor Miller, of Harvard Law School, wrote of this provision--and \nI quote him--and listen carefully to this quote:\n\n       . . . It is inconceivable that any citizen, even one with \n     considerable wealth and a strong case on the merits, could \n     undertake securities fraud litigation in the face of the \n     risks created by these provisions.\n\n  Dean Sexton, of New York University Law School, wrote:\n\n       . . . the obvious effect of these provisions: who but a \n     fool would risk the remainder of his or her life savings, \n     having already been defrauded out of much of them? Even \n     wealthy interest will not expose their assets to the possible \n     onslaught of unlimited defense costs, or judicial fee-\n     shifting excesses.\n\n  Sustaining the President's veto would give Congress the chance to \ncraft a more reasonable rule 11 provision, actually to go back to the \nprovision that the Senate passed before it was mutilated in the \nconference committee.\n  Sustaining the President's veto, of course, obviously would not be \nthe end of this legislative effort. There is, obviously, very strong \nsupport in the Congress for dealing with the issue of frivolous \nlawsuits. The difference is not to go so far that you have an \nunbalanced product. The debate tends to be a citation of abusive \ninstances, and I want to make it very clear that those of us who \nsupport the veto do not defend the abusive instances and would support \nlegislation designed to deal with it.\n  But this legislation goes too far, as I have indicated, in the three \nprovisions the President focused on in his veto message: the pleading \nstandard, the safe harbor and the now unbalanced rule 11 provision. In \neach instance, that would make it more difficult for innocent investors \nto bring lawsuits and to recover damages when they have been defrauded.\n  This is a piece of legislation people are going to have to live with \non their history, and I am prepared to predict here today that the \nconsequence of this legislation will be that innocent people \n\n[[Page S19040]]\nwith meritorious claims will not be able to assert them in court; the \npeople who have been defrauded will not be able to obtain a remedy; the \nCharles Keatings of the world will walk free; and senior citizens, \npension plans, ordinary investors will have no recourse. The stories \nthen that are going to be told are going to be the stories of predatory \nactions against innocent people, with them not having any way to obtain \njustice.\n  The President said in the veto message:\n\n       It is not appropriate to erect procedural barriers that \n     will keep wrongly injured persons from having their day in \n     court.\n\n  The Congress ought to take the opportunity to rework this legislation \nto eliminate these defects, to get a piece of legislation that we could \nall agree on as being worthwhile and meritorious, that was not \nsubjected to the sort of scathing criticism that is reflected in these \nletters from some very distinguished legal scholars with respect to \nthis matter.\n  These people do not argue against doing something about frivolous \nlawsuits, but they are saying in the course of trying to do that, do \nnot go so far that you are ruling out meritorious lawsuits. There is \nplenty of time remaining in this Congress. It is not as though we are \nat the end of a Congress, so that if you do not act, you have to start \nall over again. There is plenty of time remaining in this Congress to \ndeal with this matter.\n  Other provisions in this legislation, which no one has raised an \nissue about, provide protection against the professional plaintiff, \nagainst class action lawyers who abuse investors who have been \ndefrauded. Those provisions no one is questioning.\n  Most of the debate focuses on extreme cases. The provisions in the \nlegislation that address the extreme cases no one is arguing against. \nSo I want it clearly understood, when we hear these various horror \nstories, the provisions that would get at those instances, no one is \nquestioning. We are prepared to see those go into law.\n  But I think we have to really narrow the focus down to what is at \nissue here.\n  There is a great tendency to cite the extreme examples, but no one is \ncontesting the extreme examples. We need to craft a piece of \nlegislation, of which we can be proud, that stands legal scrutiny and \nthat will not result in individual investors, pension funds, local \ngovernments suffering when they are defrauded in the securities markets \nand are denied their day in court.\n  Sustaining the veto would enable us to do that, and I think the end \nresult would be that we would have a better piece of legislation, and \nthe end result then would be that we would not come back on another day \nciting the horror stories of investors who have been defrauded who, by \nany standard, ought to be able to obtain justice and are denied their \nday in court.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n\n                                           Harvard Law School,\n\n                                 Cambridge, MA, December 19, 1995.\n     Hon. William J. Clinton,\n     President of the United States,\n     The White House,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. President: On December 12 I wrote to you \n     concerning the so called ``securities reform'' legislation, \n     then embodied in Senate Bill 240. I urged you to oppose that \n     legislation because (1) it was based on a totally erroneous \n     assumption that there had been a sharp increase in securities \n     litigation in the recent past, which is completely belied by \n     every statistical measure available; (2) the federal courts, \n     exploiting a variety of procedural tools such as pretrial \n     management, summary judgment motions, sanctions, and enhanced \n     pleading requirements, were achieving many of the goals of \n     the so called reformists, most particularly the deterrence of \n     ``frivolous'' litigation; (3) recent history suggests that \n     the same vigilance is needed today to guard against market \n     fraud as was needed during the superheated activity in the \n     securities business in the mid-1980's; and (4) the SEC simply \n     is unable to perform the necessary prophylaxis to safeguard \n     the nation's investors, and private enforcement is an \n     absolutely integral part of policing the nation's \n     marketplaces.\n       I am writing again because the latest version of the \n     legislation, H.R. 1058, contains provisions regarding \n     pleading in securities cases and sanction procedures that, if \n     anything, make the legislation even more draconian and \n     access-barring than Senate Bill 240. It simply is perverse to \n     consider it a ``reform'' measure.\n       I have always taken great pride in the fact that the words \n     ``equal justice under law'' are engraved on the portico of \n     the United States Supreme Court. I fear, however, that if the \n     proposed legislation is signed into law, access to the \n     federal courts for those who have been victimized by illicit \n     practices in our securities markets will be foreclosed, \n     effectively discriminating against millions of Americans who \n     entrust their earnings to the securities markets. As \n     difficult as the existing Federals Rules of Civil \n     Procedure already make it to plead a claim for securities \n     fraud sufficient to survive a motion to dismiss, \n     especially given existing judicial attitudes toward these \n     cases, the passage in House Bill 1058 requiring that the \n     plaintiff ``state with particularity facts giving rise to \n     a strong inference'' that the defendant acted with \n     scienter, in conjunction with the automatic stay of \n     discovery pending adjudication of dismissal motions, \n     effectively will destroy the private enforcement \n     capacities that have been given to investors to police our \n     nation's marketplace. Despite misleading statements in the \n     Statement of Managers that this provision is designed to \n     make the legislation consistent with existing Federal Rule \n     9, the truth is diametrically the opposite, since the \n     existing Rule clearly provides that matters relating to \n     state of mind need not be pleaded with particularly. \n     Indeed, it would be more accurate to describe the proposal \n     as a reversion to Nineteenth Century notions of procedure. \n     The proposed legislation also does considerable damage to \n     notions of privilege and confidence by demanding that \n     allegations on information and belief must be accompanied \n     by a particularization of ``all facts on which that belief \n     is formed.''\n       The situation is compounded by the proposed fee shifting \n     and bond provisions that relate to the enhanced sanction \n     language in the legislation. It is inconceivable that any \n     citizen, even one with considerable wealth and a strong case \n     on the merits, could undertake securities fraud litigation in \n     the face of the risks created by these provisions. As the \n     person who was the Reporter to the Federal Rules Advisory \n     Committee during the formulation and promulgation of the 1983 \n     revision of Federal Rule 11, the primary sanction provision \n     in those Rules, I can assure you that no one on that \n     distinguished committee would have possibly supported what is \n     now so cavalierly inserted into the legislation.\n       I use the word ``cavalierly'' intentionally, because, as I \n     indicated to you in my earlier letter, there is not one whit \n     of empiric research that justifies any of the procedural \n     aspects of this so called ``reform'' legislation. Not only \n     does every piece of statistical evidence available belie the \n     notion that there is any upsurge in securities fraud cases, \n     but these proposals, with their devastating impact on our \n     nation's investors, have completely bypassed the carefully \n     crafted structure established in the 1930's for procedural \n     revision that has enabled the Federal Rules to maintain their \n     stature as the model for procedural fairness and currency. \n     Thus, the proposed legislation represents a mortal blow both \n     to the policies that support the private enforcement of major \n     federal regulatory legislation and to the orderly \n     consideration and evaluation of all proposals for the \n     modification of the Federal Rules. From my perspective, which \n     is that of a practitioner in the federal courts, a teacher of \n     civil procedure for almost thirty-five years, and a co-author \n     of the standard work on federal practice and procedure, I \n     fear that all of this is extremely regrettable.\n       I hope you will give serious consideration to vetoing the \n     legislation. If I can be of any further assistance to you or \n     your staff in considering these and related matters, please \n     do not hesitate to inquire. My telephone number is 617/495-\n     4111.\n       My very best to you and your family during this wonderful \n     holiday season.\n           Sincerely yours,\n                                                 Arthur R. Miller,\n     Bruce Bromley Professor of Law.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n\n                                    The University of Arizona,\n\n                                    Tucson, AZ, December 13, 1995.\n     Hon. William J. Clinton,\n     The President,\n     The White House,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. President: I am writing to urge you to veto \n     pending legislation, The Private Securities Litigation Reform \n     Act H.R. 1058.\n       For the past 18 years, my principal work has been in the \n     field of federal Securities Regulation. I am the co-author \n     with Harvard Law School Professor Louis Loss of an 11 volume \n     treatise on Securities Regulation, published by Little, Brown \n     & Co., which is generally considered to be the leading \n     treatise in the field. I have written four other securities \n     regulation related books and over 25 Law Review articles in \n     this area. Earlier I had a discussion with respect to a \n     different version of H.R. 1050 with your General Counsel, \n     Abner Mikva.\n       The current bill, while an improvement over legislation \n     that was introduced last January, is unduly heavy handed and \n     clumsily drafted and would prevent a significant number of \n     meritorious law suits from going forward. I am particularly \n     concerned no only about the safe harbor provisions, but also \n     about provisions concerning Rule 11, the pleading \n     requirements; and the extraordinarily one-side language that \n     appears in the legislative history. Legislative history may \n     not be a point many people have emphasized, but it is my \n     understanding that it was written without earlier review by \n     the Securities and Exchange Commission or its staff, and \n     reflects policy preferences more typical of what appeared in \n     the January 1995 version of this legislation. I take \n     legislative history very seriously, for having studied every \n     reported federal securities Law decision over \n\n[[Page S19041]]\n     the past 12 or so years as a result of my work with Professor Loss, I \n     am well aware that it is frequently dispositive in questions \n     such as those addressed in this particular legislation.\n       If this bill is vetoed, I am confident it will not be the \n     end of the road for this process. It is possible for Congress \n     if the veto is sustained to draft a more balanced and \n     appropriate bill within a matter of weeks. On the other hand, \n     if this bill is not vetoed, this will provide opportunity for \n     that small number of corporations that do engage in federal \n     securities fraud to feel a greater sense of immunity from \n     private litigation, and in many instances, given the \n     limitations of the SEC and Justice Departments budgets, from \n     any litigation deterrent at all.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                    Joel Seligman,\n     Dean and Samuel M. Fegtly Professor of Law.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                               New York University\n\n\n                                                School of Law,\n\n                                  New York, NY, December 13, 1995.\n     President William J. Clinton,\n     The White House,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. President: I am a student and teacher of Civil \n     Procedure and the principal active author of the most widely \n     used textbook on the subject. I approach matters of Civil \n     Procedure not as an advocate for particular parties, but as a \n     scholar interested in coherence, fairness and efficiency in \n     the system. I am imposing upon your time with this letter \n     because I feel compelled to convey my view that the \n     Conference Committee Securities Litigation Reform bill (which \n     in critical respects is dramatically different from the \n     Senate bill) is a procedural nightmare that will chill \n     meritorious litigation by victims of securities fraud--and \n     equally importantly, will provide a precedent for substantive \n     procedural rules which most certainly will be copied with \n     disastrous consequences in other areas (for example, in the \n     area of civil rights).\n       The Conference Committee bill effects far-reaching \n     procedural changes that will govern both class and individual \n     litigation in one type of federal case--litigation under the \n     federal securities laws. These will affect not only \n     shareholder claims, but also insurance policyholders and \n     limited partnership claims, among others, which seek relief \n     under federal securities laws. The bill advances these \n     procedural changes, which undermine fifty years of procedural \n     reform, without consulting even a single judicial witness in \n     its hearings. Cumulatively, the reforms will impose obstacles \n     that will make it impossible for the average citizen to \n     pursue, let alone to prevail upon, virtually any securities \n     claims, no matter how valid.\n       I will not examine every section of the bill; rather, I \n     will confine my comments to the provisions which, viewed from \n     the perspective of a proceduralist, seem most perverse.\n\n\n                    Heightened Pleading Requirements\n\n       Although the Senate bill purported to adopt the Second \n     Circuit's already elevated (beyond Rule 9) pleading \n     requirements for fraud, the Conference Report goes beyond \n     that, requiring that the complaint shall ``state with \n     particularity facts giving rise to a strong inference'' that \n     the defendant acted with scienter (emphasis supplied). In \n     addition, the Conference Report contains an automatic stay of \n     discovery pending adjudication of a motion to dismiss.\n       In essence, the Conference Report establishes almost \n     insurmountable hurdles in the form of pleading requirements \n     as a barrier to federal court. Absent the most extraordinary \n     circumstances (such as a prior federal indictment), it simply \n     will be impossible for the plaintiff, without discovery, to \n     meet the standard inserted by the Conference Committee at the \n     last minute, which is to state ``with particularity'' facts \n     that give rise to a strong inference that a defendant acted \n     with the required state of mind at the outset of the case. \n     While the Statement of Managers recites that the words ``with \n     particularity'' were added to make this requirement \n     consistent with Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 9, that Rule \n     explicitly states that facts on state of mind need not be \n     specifically set forth. No other type of case requires such \n     precise pleading--because it was long ago recognized as \n     impossible to achieve except for those intimately involved in \n     an action, a status not enjoyed by people buying stock on the \n     open market.\n       In addition, the pleading requirement states that ``if an \n     allegation regarding a fraudulent statement or omission is \n     made on information and belief, the complaint shall state \n     with particularity all facts on which that belief is \n     formed.'' That requirement would appear to provide that the \n     plaintiff would have to set forth all confidential sources in \n     the complaint, including the names of whistleblowers and \n     members of the media. This disclosure requirement deters pre-\n     complaint investigation and completely reverses the attorney-\n     work product protection afforded other types of litigants.\n\n\n                Enhanced Sanctions and Bond Requirement\n\n       I am opposed to fee-shifting, and I always have understood \n     that was your policy as well. Any significant chance of fee-\n     shifting will deter all meritorious cases in which a \n     plaintiff has little to gain in potential recovery in \n     relation to the magnitude of the fees to be shifted, as is \n     frequently the case in securities class action litigation. In \n     these circumstances, any significant chance of fee-shifting \n     is going to be a major deterrent. The simple mathematics of \n     the situation suggests the obvious effect of these \n     provisions: who but a fool would risk the remainder of his or \n     her life savings, having already been defrauded out of much \n     of them? Even wealthy interests will not expose their \n     assets to the possible onslaught of unlimited defense \n     costs, or judicial fee-shifting excesses.\n       Similarly the bond provision, which has no standard to \n     guide its administration, is completely inequitable and will \n     operate only against plaintiffs. The notion that such a bond \n     provision could run against defendants is preposterous, as it \n     is clearly unconstitutional to require an individual to post \n     a bond in order to defend himself or herself in court.\n\n\n           perverse cumulative synergy of procedural changes\n\n       The disastrous effects of all these changes on meritorious \n     litigation can be seen easily if one hypothetically shifts \n     the context to Title VII litigation--the likely next target \n     for the ``reformers'' if this bill becomes law. Given the \n     extraordinarily high economic exposure (resulting from the \n     possibility of sanctions), the necessity of a bond, and the \n     difficulty in meeting the pleading requirement without \n     discovery, is it possible to imagine many plaintiffs (even \n     those with what appear to be winning cases) taking the risk \n     even of initiating litigation? And, of course, this will be \n     the case in securities litigation as well. Essentially, \n     through ``procedural reform'' and a selective return to \n     Nineteenth Century pleading rules, real victims will be \n     prevented from seeking redress.\n       Because much litigation will never come to be, it would be \n     wrong to assert that the courts will be able to ameliorate \n     these rules. Moreover, in the case of the highly problematic \n     pleading requirements, even in those suits which materialize \n     the courts would not have the power to overrule a directive \n     from a statute. Thus, though the Second Circuit could \n     promulgate its interpretation of the pleading requirement of \n     Rule 9 on matters other than intent, it could not have \n     applied its test in the area of intent, because the Rule (by \n     its terms) exempted intent; so also, if the Committee Bill \n     becomes law, the Second Circuit would not be free to exempt \n     intent, because the statute includes it.\n       In my opinion, you should veto this bill. I would \n     appreciate any consideration you can give to my views. If any \n     member of your staff has questions, please do not hesitate to \n     call me at 212-998-6000.\n       Best of luck in this and all things. Love to all.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                      John Sexton.\n\n                               Exhibit 2\n\n                                            Columbia University in\n\n\n                                         the City of New York,\n\n                                   New York, NY, December 6, 1995.\n     The President,\n     The White House,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. President: I am writing with regard to the \n     proposed ``Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995'' \n     (the ``Act'') in light of the November 28, 1995 Proposed \n     Conference Report and the accompanying ``Statement of \n     Managers'', which constitutes its primary legislative \n     history.\n       The special focus of my letter is on the proposed ``safe \n     harbor for forward-looking statements'' that the Act would \n     codify. Although there are other serious problems with the \n     Act, it is this area where its deficiencies are the most \n     glaring and where the recently drafted legislative history \n     most clearly distorts the original intent of the proponents \n     of such a safe harbor. Over the last two years, I have \n     repeatedly testified before Congressional committees on the \n     subject of securities legislation, have drafted a proposed \n     administrative ``safe harbor'' rule at the request of the \n     SEC, and have served as an informal consultant to attorneys \n     on the staff of the White House counsel on the subject to \n     such a safe harbor. Throughout this process, I have strongly \n     supported the desirability of such a safe harbor, believing \n     that it will encourage fuller disclosure from issuers who \n     would otherwise be chilled from making projections by the \n     threat of private civil liability. Unfortunately, I believe \n     the formulation of the proposed ``safe harbor'' in Section \n     102 of the Act, when read in light of its legislative \n     history, does the reverse. That is, its adoption would \n     seriously erode the quality of disclosure in our national \n     securities markets and, in some cases, would give issuers a \n     virtual ``license to lie''.\n       Simply put the core problem is that the Act's safe harbor, \n     as finally drafted, does not require the issuer to identify \n     the substantive factors known to it that are most likely to \n     cause actual results to differ materially from projected \n     results. Rather, the issuer could simply provide a \n     representative list of ``important factors'' that could cause \n     actual results to differ materially from projected results. \n     Thus, for example, an issuer might be aware of ten factors \n     that could cause its projection to go awry and could \n     deliberately list only the third, fifth, seventh and tenth \n     most important factors, intentionally omitting the first, \n     second, fourth factors (or three out of the first four). This \n     outcome is very different from what would be tolerated today \n     by the federal courts, because these courts have crafted a \n     protective doctrine (known) as the ``bespeaks caution'' \n     doctrine) to shelter issuers from liability when their \n     projections prove materially inaccurate. However, this \n     judicial doctrine applies only when the projection is \n     accompanied by cautionary language that is ``specifically \n     tailored'' to the actual projection made and the \n\n[[Page S19042]]\n     special risks faced by the issuer. Not only does the Act lack any \n     requirement that the cautionary statements be in any \n     respect ``tailored'' to the projections made, but its \n     legislative history now makes clear for the first time \n     (and at the last minute) that the issuer need only \n     disclose some of the reasons known to it why the \n     projection may prove false (and apparently not the most \n     important such reasons). In this light, rather than simply \n     codify the emerging ``bespeak caution'' doctrine, it is \n     much closer to the trust to say that the Act overrules \n     that doctrine.\n       To understand this assessment, it is necessary to focus \n     briefly on the legislative language and its accompanying \n     legislative history. Under proposed Sec. 27A (and also under \n     a companion provision that amends the Securities Exchange Act \n     of 1934), a defendant cannot be held liable in a private \n     action with respect to a forward-looking statement if and to \n     the extent that either of the following occurs:\n       (A) The forward-looking statement is identified as such and \n     ``is accompanied by meaningful cautionary statements \n     identifying important factors that could cause actual results \n     to differ materially from those in the forward-looking \n     statement;'' or\n       (B) the plaintiff fails to prove that the defendant (or \n     certain officers thereof) had ``actual knowledge . . . [of] \n     an untrue statement of a material fact or omisssion of a \n     material fact. . .''\n       Thus, even if knowingly false statement is made, the \n     defendant escapes liability if ``meaningful cautionary \n     statement'' are added to the forward-looking statement. This \n     is bad enough, but under the proposed legislative history \n     there now appears to be no obligation to disclose the most \n     important reasons why the forward-looking statement may prove \n     false (so long as some ``important factors'' are indicated). \n     Specifically, the Statement of the Managers directs:\n       ``Failure to include the particular factor that ultimately \n     causes the forward-looking statement not to come true will \n     not mean that the statement is not protected by the safe \n     harbor. The Conference Committee specifies that the \n     cautionary statements identify ``important' factors to \n     provide guidance to issuers and not to provide the \n     opportunity for plaintiff counsel to conduct discovery on \n     what factors were known to the issuer at the time the \n     forward-looking statement was made. . . .The first prong of \n     the safe harbor requires courts to examine only the \n     cautionary statement accompanying the forward-looking \n     statement. Courts should not examine the state of mind of the \n     person making the statement.'' (at pp. 17-18).\n       On this basin, a court would not be able to ascertain what \n     ``important factors'' the issuer was aware of but failed to \n     disclose. It is at least arguable than if the issuer \n     disclosed factors that were ``important'' but not among the \n     top four or five reasons why actual results might deviate \n     materially from predicted results, such disclosure would \n     still satisfy this standard. Simply put, no public policy \n     justification can support such selective disclosure of the \n     less important factors while withholding the most \n     important.\n       Throughout the legislative drafting process, the managers \n     of the Act have argued that their safe harbor provision \n     largely codified the ``bespeaks caution'' doctrine, but just \n     avoided overly exacting (and litigation-promoting) terms, \n     such as ``specifically tailored.'' Perhaps, it was \n     understandable those fearful of an excessive incentive to \n     litigate would wish to avoid such a formulation. Thus a weak \n     compromise was reached under which the disclosures would only \n     have to include ``meaningful cautionary statements.'' Now, \n     however, with the appearance of the legislative history, even \n     that compromise has been undercut by language suggesting that \n     only a few representative factors need be disclosed.\n       The impact of this change is shown by the following \n     entirely realistic examples:\n       1. A biotech company, whose future depends on the \n     development of a new drug, projects that it will be in the \n     market within 18 months, but acknowledges that this \n     projection is subject to the uncertainties of FDA approval. \n     However, it fails to disclose that the FDA has just \n     questioned the adequacy of its tests and suggested that a new \n     round of testing may be necessary.\n       2. A company projects a 50% increase in its earnings for \n     the next year and specifies that this projection is \n     conditioned on (i) the current level of interest rates, (2) \n     continued high demand for its products, (3) the availability \n     of certain scarce supplies, and (4) its ability to obtain \n     adequate financing from its lenders to exploit business \n     opportunities. Omitted from this list of important factors is \n     the critical factor that 50% of its sales come from a single \n     contract with a major customer, who has experienced major \n     business and financial difficulties and has sought to \n     renegotiate its future payments, claiming that it might be \n     unable to pay for future deliveries.\n       In both these cases, some ``important factors'' are \n     disclosed, but the critical facts are omitted. Under current \n     law, the forward-looking statements would not be protected, \n     because the cautionary statements were not ``specifically \n     tailored.'' However, under the Act, they may be insulated \n     from private liability--with the result that the securities \n     market will become somewhat more ``noisy'' and less \n     transparent and investors will have to discount projections \n     for the risk that material information was not disclosed.\n       So what should be done? Ultimately, the options at this \n     point are limited. Nonetheless, I suggest that there are two \n     options that do not require the sacrifice of the federal \n     securities laws' traditional objective of full and fair \n     disclosure:\n       (1) Veto Plus An Administrative Rule. The President could \n     veto the Act, but simultaneously announce the promulgation by \n     the SEC of an administrative safe harbor rule that protects \n     forward-looking statements so long as the principal risk \n     factors known to management at the time the forward-looking \n     statement is made are disclosed (along with any material \n     facts bearing on these risk factors); or\n       (2) Signature Plus An Administrative Rule. The President \n     could sign the Act, but instruct the SEC to adopt an \n     interpretative rule defining what constitutes adequate \n     ``meaningful cautionary statements'' for purposes of the \n     Act's safe harbor. This administrative definition would, of \n     course, require an issuer to identify the principal factors \n     known to it that are in its judgment most likely to cause \n     actual results to deviate from projected results.\n       This second option deserves a brief word of explanation. \n     Although the legislative history in the Statement of Managers \n     is adverse, it is not decisive. Nothing in it clearly \n     prohibits an SEC interpretative rule along the lines \n     indicated above. In any event, the Supreme Court is divided \n     on the weight to be given to legislative history. \n     Particularly because the term ``meaningful cautionary \n     statements'' is not self-evident, but has soft edges, courts \n     are likely to give substantial discretion to an \n     administrative agency to define the critical terms in the \n     statute under which it operates. See Chevron, U.S.A. Inc. v. \n     Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., 467 U.S. 837 (1984) \n     (agency has substantial powers to resolve legal ambiguities \n     in its statute and federal court should give deference to its \n     greater expertise).\n       The advantage of this latter approach is that allows the \n     other provisions of the Act to take effect. Although I and \n     many others also have problems with these provisions, they \n     are of a lesser order of magnitude.\n       to sum up, the latest changes and associated legislative \n     history has made a bad provision worse. I, therefore, urge \n     you to either veto the Private securities Litigation Reform \n     Act of 1995, or sign it only after receiving the assurance of \n     the SEC that it can and will correct the excesses of the safe \n     harbor provision through administrative rule-making.\n           Respectfully submitted,\n     John C. Coffee, Jr.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                            Columbia University in\n\n\n                                         the City of New York,\n\n                                  New York, NY, December 13, 1995.\n     Re private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 (the \n         ``Act'') Safe Harbor Provisions.\n\n     Bruce Lindsey, Esq.\n     Associate White House Counsel, The White House,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Lindsey: This is a follow-up to my letter to the \n     President of December 6, 1995, in which I voiced my \n     criticisms of the ``safe harbor for forward-looking \n     statements.'' While I stated (and continue to believe) that \n     the safe harbor provisions represent the most glaring \n     deficiency in the Act, I also suggested that these problems \n     could be substantially corrected by SEC rule-making. \n     Subsequently, I have been asked to clarify my views on the \n     SEC's authority to adopt a definitional rule in light of the \n     legislative history that will accompany the Act (which I had \n     reviewed but did not specifically discuss in my earlier \n     letter).\n       Initially, it should be noted that both the Securities Act \n     of 1933 (in Section 19) and the Securities Exchange Act of \n     1934 (in Section 3(b)) delegate broad authority to the SEC \n     ``by rules and regulations to define technical, trade, \n     accounting, and other terms used in this title, consistently \n     with the provisions and purposes of this title.'' \\1\\ Indeed, \n     the Commission used this authority over a decade ago to adopt \n     a ``safe harbor for forward-looking information.'' See SEC \n     Rules 175 and 3b-6 (''Liability for Certain Statements by \n     Issuers'').\n     \\1\\ This is the language of Sec.  3(b); Sec.  19(a) of the \n     1933 Act has some immaterial differences, which, if anything, \n     give broader authority to the SEC ``to make, amend, and \n     rescind such rules and regulations as may be necessary to \n     carry out the provisions of this title.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n       My suggestion was that the SEC could adopt a new rule under \n     both the 1933 Act and the 1934 Act to define what constituted \n     ``meaningful cautionary statements.'' I asserted that the \n     Supreme Court's decision in Chevron, U.S.A. Inc. v. Natural \n     Resources Defense Council, Inc., 467 U.S. Sec. 837 (1984) \n     indicated that courts would be required to deter to such an \n     agency rule. As I understand it, some concern has been raised \n     as to whether the legislative history to the Act so clearly \n     indicates a contrary Congressional intent on this question as \n     to preclude such a rule. this letter is intended to address \n     this concern.\n       Under the Chevron decision, judicial review of an agency's \n     construction of the statute that it administers has two \n     stages. First, the court considers ``whether Congress has \n     directly spoken to the precise question at issue.'' Id. at \n     842. Second, ``[i]f * * * the court determines Congress has \n     not directly addressed the precise question at issue,'' the \n     court determines ``whether the agency's answer is based on a \n     permissible construction of the statute.'' Id. at 843. In \n     this latter inquiry, substantial deference must be given to \n     the agency's greater institutional expertise.\n     \n[[Page S19043]]\n\n       Let us suppose then that the SEC were to adopt a \n     definitional rule defining ``meaningful cautionary \n     statements'' so as to require the corporation seeking to rely \n     on the statutory safe harbor to ``identify those substantive \n     factors then known to the corporation's executive officers \n     that were in their judgment most likely to cause actual \n     results to differ materially from the results projected in \n     the forward-looking statement.''\\2\\\n     \\2\\ Of course, this is intended only as a first \n     approximation, but I do not believe that such a rule would be \n     hard to draft.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n       Obviously, the first issue is whether the legislative \n     history indicates that Congress has directly spoken to ``the \n     precise question at issue.'' Whether ``the precise question'' \n     be broadly defined as the meaning of ``meaningful cautionary \n     statements'' or more narrowly defined as whether such \n     statements should indicate the most important reasons why \n     actual results may deviate from predicted results, my answer \n     is the same: Congress has not spoken to either question. \n     Reviewing the Statement of Managers, one finds only two \n     statements that address these issues, even indirectly. First, \n     at p. 17, it states:\n       ``The Conference Committee expects that the cautionary \n     statements identify important factors that could cause \n     results to differ materially--but not all factors. Failure to \n     include the particular factor that ultimately causes the \n     forward-looking statement not to come true will not mean that \n     the statement is not protected by the safe harbor.''\n       This understandable position does not, however, conflict \n     with an SEC definition that required the issuer to identify \n     the most important factors then known to it. Logically, the \n     failure to identify the particular factor may have been \n     because that factor was remote and unlikely to occur (i.e. \n     number thirteen on a list of fifteen recognized factors). \n     Hence, there is no necessary conflict. Moreover, the proposed \n     rule could accommodate this point by expressly providing that \n     the failure to identify the particular factor would not be \n     decisive if the issuer had not perceived it to be among the \n     most important factors (ranked either in order of probability \n     of occurrence or magnitude of the consequences if it \n     occurred) or had identified several other factors that it \n     considered to be of greater importance. Put simply, a \n     Congressional intent to permit omission of the actual factor \n     does not preclude a rule requiring disclosure of the most \n     important factors.\n       A second and more oblique statement of Congressional intent \n     may arguably be inferred from the Statement of Managers' \n     attempt to limit discovery. At pp. 17-18, that statement \n     directs:\n       ``The Conference Committee specifies that the cautionary \n     statements identify `important' factors to provide guidance \n     to issuers and not to provide an opportunity for plaintiff \n     counsel to conduct discovery on what factors were known to \n     the issuer at the time the forward-looking statement was \n     made. * * * The first prong of the safe harbor requires \n     courts to examine only the cautionary statement accompanying \n     the forward-looking statement. Courts should not examine the \n     mind of the person making the statement.''\n       Initially, it should be observed that the above language \n     addresses only discovery and not the substantive content of \n     the ``meaningful cautionary statements.'' Moreover, this \n     language may be in direct conflict with the statutory \n     language (in which case the statute should trump the \n     legislative history). Both Sections 27A((f) and 21E(f) \n     expressly authorize discovery ``specifically directed to the \n     applicability of the exemption provided for in this \n     Section.'' Nonetheless, someone may potentially argue that \n     this hostility to discovery as to issuer's state of mind \n     precludes a rule requiring the ``meaningful cautionary \n     statements'' to identify the most important risk factors then \n     known to the issuer. This seems a weak and very inferential \n     claim. Even without discovery addressed to the issuer's state \n     of mind, a court can assess whether the factors most likely \n     to cause a projection not to be realized have been disclosed. \n     Indeed, one possible answer to this objection is to frame the \n     definition in terms of disclosure of the factors that a \n     reasonable person in the corporation's position would have \n     foreseen as being most likely to cause actual and predicted \n     results to deviate materially. Then, the focus becomes \n     objective and not subjective, and there is no conflict with \n     the Congressional prohibition on discovery as to the \n     corporation's state of mind. Discovery could then focus on \n     whether the risk factors were generally recognized in the \n     relevant industry (without focusing on the issuer's state of \n     mind). In short, both objections to the proposed rule can be \n     easily outflanked.\n       This then takes us to the second level of analysis: is the \n     SEC's interpretation ``based on a permissible construction of \n     the statute?'' See Chevron, U.S.A. v. Natural Resources \n     Defense Council, 467 U.S. at 843. If it is, ``a court may not \n     substitute its own construction of a statutory provision for \n     a reasonable interpretation made by the administrator of an \n     agency,'' Id. at 844. There seems no need to belabor the \n     reasonableness of requiring disclosure of the factors most \n     likely to cause the projection to go awry. Disclosure of \n     remote factors would indeed not be ``meaningful'' because it \n     would not convey an accurate sense of the relevant risk \n     level.\n       Independently, I should note that respected legal \n     commentators have recently stressed the role of presidential \n     interpretations in the proper judicial construction of a \n     statute's meaning. See Thomas W. Merrill, Judicial Deference \n     to Executive Precedent, 101 Yale L.J. 969 (1992). While it is \n     not necessary to rely on this ``executive precedent model,'' \n     its availability could be strengthened by a contemporaneous \n     statement by the President as to how he believes the term \n     ``meaningful cautionary statements'' should be read. Such a \n     declaration is not necessary, but cannot hurt.\n       I hope these comments are useful. If I can be helpful in \n     any way, please do not hestitate to contact me.\n           Yours tryly,\n                                               John C. Coffee, Jr.\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from New \nMexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Parliamentary inquiry, Mr. President. There are no time \nlimits on this yet, are there?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There are no time limits.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Have we agreed on the time to vote yet?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. We have not.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I am pleased to have an opportunity to \nspeak before 1 o'clock, because I will not be back on the Senate floor \nfor a few hours after that. I thank the floor manager for accommodating \nme, and I thank the Senate for giving me this chance to talk for just a \nfew minutes.\n  I think the issue is pretty simple, although my good friend from \nMaryland can, indeed, make it very complex with reference to rules of \nprocedure, cites of precedent and Federal rule requirements. This issue \nis very simple, we have a situation in the country where many who want \nto sustain the President's veto talk about saving, protecting the \ninvestors so that lawsuits can be filed on their behalf against those \nwho would perpetrate fraud against them as the management or executive \npart of a corporation. The scenario is ``people need protection because \nsomebody is going to do them in.''\n  Let me tell you, the basic problem is that the system we have right \nnow does in the investor and it does in the company. It does the \nstockholder in, whether it is a small stockholder or somebody who is in \none of the giant investment groups in the country as a stockholder. \nRemember, there are always shareholders on both sides of a case. The \nnonsuing shareholders receive lower dividends and lower stock prices \nwhen their companies are sued in these class actions. And the members \nof the plaintiff class don't do too well either. The ones who do well \nare the class action lawyers. The attorneys run these cases, decide who \nto sue and when to settle. According to the Millberg Weiss data that \nwere submitted to the U.S. Senate, and it was not a submission that we \neasily obtained, the problem is that if you collect total damages in \none of these suits and let us just say it is a dollar--it is never a \ndollar, it is more like $30 million--if it is a dollar, 14 cents of \nthat goes to the investors. I am not saying that the entire 86 cents \ngoes to the lawyers, but it does not go to the investor.\n  Essentially, there is a lot going on behind that simple fact. There \nare many factors that affect what is going on in the litigation cosmos \nagainst corporations on the so-called behalf of the so-called \nstockholders. But, in essence, the system we have is not working. In \nfact, it is detrimental to the people we allege we are trying to \nprotect by a Federal court-made rule, the private right of action under \nSection 10b.\n  There is no statutory law in America that created class action \nlawsuits under section 10b of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934.\n  The courts created the implied private right of action as a method of \ngetting justice and expediting matters so that each stockholder, in the \ncase of these kinds of suits, did not have to file their own lawsuits. \nIn the process, let me suggest that it is very simple to come to the \nfloor and say we ought to fix that. It is very simple for my friend \nfrom Maryland to come to the floor and say, ``We agree on some \nthings.''\n  Mr. President, we have been trying to reform the system, in an active \nway, for at least 5 years. We probably have been trying to fix it for \n10 years. But, that I am aware of, we have been actively trying to fix \nit for 5 years--fix this problem, the problem that lawyers are no \nlonger lawyers in the sense that people understand them to be. They are \nentrepreneurial lawyers. That means \n\n[[Page S19044]]\nthey are in the business of manufacturing lawsuits and making money, if \nthey can find the situation where a stock price drops and the lawyers \ncan allege fraud. Believe you me, they look for them, they find them, \nthey recruit them, and they use the same plaintiff many times in many \nsuits. They have their favorites. They are called professional \nplaintiffs or pet plaintiffs.\n  In one set of facts before the committee last year, we found that a \nvery elderly man--I think he was over 90--owned small amounts of stock \nin a whole in a large number of corporations because, if he had enough, \nhe would be the favored plaintiff of this new breed of lawyers. In \nexchange for letting the lawyer use your name, the professional \nplaintiff gets a bonus payment of thousands of dollars. Entrepreneurial \nlawyers agree with statements that say, ``Once we get one of these \nsuits, it is wonderful. We do not work for the stockholders, we work \nfor ourselves because our interest becomes how much money can we \nfinally get if a president of a company, an auditor who did part of the \nwork, a CPA that did work, a board of directors that voted it--how many \nof these can we bring into a lawsuit?'' At some point, they all add up \na little money and they have a nice pot, and it is looking good. ``Gee, \nwe might make $10 million, $20 million out of this.'' And now we settle \nit. And this results, right here on this chart.\n  My friend from Maryland would say, well, you have come a long way, \nand many of the provisions in this bill we agree with. But my question \nis: How long do we have to debate? How many hearings do we have to \nhave? How many Senators do we have to have voting for this? How many \nHouse Members do we have to have voting on it--only to find that those \nthat support the President's veto come to the floor and say there is \nsomething really bad with what is going on out there. And this is a \ngood bill.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. But the opponents say we did not quite fix it right. \nLet me suggest to the Senators that are going to vote here tonight, we \nfixed it about as right as Democrat and Republican Senators--Democrat \nand Republican House Members, in large numbers--can do with a piece of \nlegislation over a sustained period of time, with a lot of effort. And \nthey did it. As a matter of fact, there has been more bipartisan \nparticipation on this bill, and from different spectrums of the \nideological makeup of this Congress, than any bill I have seen since I \nhave been here.\n  It has Senators Helms, Lott, and Gramm voting for it, and it has \nSenators Mikulski, Kennedy, and Harkin on the bill and voting for the \nbill. And then when the bill came back from conference, a wide spectrum \nof Senators voted for it again.\n  So, Mr. President, the truth of the matter is--I do not say this to \nmy friend from Maryland, I make it as a broad statement--there are \nabout 90 lawyers out there in the United States--maybe 110, or \nsomething like that--that you will never satisfy. They are powerful, \nthey are strong, they have a lot of money, and they are listened to by \na lot of people; they make huge political contributions, and everybody \nknows that. And you will never satisfy them because they like the \nsystem as it is.\n  There is an old gypsy curse that goes like this: ``May you be the \ninnocent defendant in a frivolous lawsuit.'' It is a curse stopping \ncompanies from creating good jobs, high-paying jobs. It is a curse for \nour economy. If it was not the most powerful around, we would probably \neasily find the enormous damage being done. It is so big and so strong \nthat all we can do is add up all the horror stories and find out that \n``something is wrong in Denmark.'' It is a curse of the Silicon Valley, \nwhich breeds entrepreneurial companies that have scattered across \nAmerica and made growth in jobs and competition a reality. All of the \nhigh-tech companies are concerned almost every day that the President \nmakes any statements about their company--biotech and high-growth \ncompanies.\n  This issue is the electronics industry's No. 1 issue.\n  Frankly, you will find them listed by the hundreds--not a few, but by \nthe hundreds--through their chief executive officers, begging the \nPresident to sign this legislation. I am sorry he did not. I think he \nmade a very bad mistake.\n  It has been a difficult job. This bill was first introduced--and it \nwas not as good as it is now--by Senator Dodd and Senator Domenici 3\\1/\n2\\ years ago. It was introduced by Senator Domenici and Senator Dodd, \nand there was a counterpart in the House sponsored by Congressman \nTauzin. It has been dramatically improved and we are here with it \ntoday.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Will the Senator yield for a question on the President's \naction?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Yes.\n  Mr. SPECTER. The President, in his veto message, focused on one \nnarrow question. Actually, he focused on three, but they boil down to \none. That is, on the somewhat arcane question of pleading. The question \ngoes to the distinguished Senator from New Mexico, whom I compliment \nfor his laborious work here. He is an attorney himself, and he is the \nproud father of an attorney, as am I.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Three attorneys.\n  Mr. SPECTER. He is the proud father of three attorneys. He only \ntalked to me about one, so I will have to find out about the other two. \nI want to ask the Senator from New Mexico a question which relates to \nthe core problem here about the requirements on proving state of mind, \nwhere the President's veto message takes up this question, with the \nconference report adopting the toughest standard in existence, the \nstandard of the second circuit. But the conference report dropped an \namendment which this Senator had offered, which was approved by a \nsubstantial majority, 57 to 42, codifying the second circuit's method \nof proving state of mind. And then the conference report also added the \nrequirement that state of mind be pleaded with particularity, which is \na direct contradiction to the general rule of civil procedure that \nstate of mind be averred generally as opposed to fraud, which has to be \npleaded with particularity.\n  Now, this is classified as an arcane subject, which means very few \npeople know anything about it. The President called me the night before \nlast because I had written to the President--and I will go into this a \nlittle more when I seek the floor on my own behalf--but in the context \nwhere you have a short statute of limitations, where you have the \nunique--not unusual, but unique--provision in the law for a mandatory \nstay of discovery when a defendant files a motion to dismiss, so that \nyou have a requirement that the plaintiff plead with particularity \nfacts on the defendant's state of mind. Does that not go too far in \nclosing the courthouse door to plaintiffs? I say that without an ax to \ngrind, and with some substantial experience as a practicing lawyer, \nalthough not in class action fields for the plaintiff. I represented \nsome defendants in securities act litigation.\n  As I take a look at the current state of the bill, different from the \nbill passed by the Senate, the President raises three points which \nwould change in the conference report, but they boil down to this \nextraordinarily high standard of pleading. Is it fair to require \ninvestors in a field where we have stock security transactions, \napproximating $4 trillion in this country each year, bearing in mind \nthe gross national product in this country is----\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I have great respect for the Senator, but I would like \nhim to ask the question.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Is it fair to have that kind of particularity required \nin that bill?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I think it is fair. My answer is briefer than your \nquestion but let me insert in the Record a letter dated October 31, \nfrom the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit, Judge Scirica, \ncircuit judge. He writes on behalf of the Judicial Conference.\n  One portion of the concern you have, as expressed by the Senator from \nPennsylvania, is that the Senate Banking Committee provision provided \nthat the complaint must ``specifically allege facts giving rise to a \nstrong inference.'' The conference report states that the complaint \nmust ``state with particularity the facts giving rise to a strong \ninference.''\n  The reason we put in ``state with particularity the facts giving rise \nto a strong inference'' is because that is what Judge Scirica, speaking \non behalf of the Judicial Conference, asked Congress to do. He \nindicated in this letter \n\n[[Page S19045]]\nthat he thought--and he was speaking for many others that are concerned \nabout pleadings--that it was more appropriate to say ``state with \nparticularity facts giving rise to a strong inference'' as compared \nwith ``specifically allege facts giving rise to a strong inference.'' \nThat is the change made, and it was made at the suggestion of an \neminent jurist.\n  Now, let me complete my remarks. The point I want to make is that \nthere have been many Senators on both sides of the aisle work on this \nlegislation. I want to thank Senator Dodd, in particular, for the \ntremendous effort he made in behalf of this legislation. I am not sure, \nMr. President, and I say this to all of those who are out there in \nAmerica--and they are by the hundreds of the thousands--who were \noverjoyed when this bill passed the Senate and passed the House and who \nwill be overjoyed tonight if we override the President. Without Senator \nDodd, we would not have made it.\n  Second, there is no doubt that without the tremendous efforts put \nforth by the chairman of that committee, the Senator from New York, \nSenator D'Amato, who started out skeptical and ended up powerfully on \nthe side of common sense and protecting our investors while we protect \nour corporations from the abuses of a burgeoning entrepreneurial \nlitigation complex out there where lawyers decide who get sued, when \ncases are settled, when they have gotten enough out of the system, to \ntake it and run, and when the end product is that they and the process \ntake most of the money.\n  I am delighted that those two Senators--there are many others--\ndecided to take this thing to heart. I had an early role, and I can \ntell you my role came because I read about this litigation. I had no \ninterest. I just have a lot of time traveling from here to New Mexico \nand occasionally I read--not often--and I read one story and it enticed \nme to read two, and finally I read three or four major stories, \nexposes, stories, about this burgeoning type of American litigation. I \ncould not believe that nothing could be done about it.\n  Frankly, I set about to draft a bill. Senator Dodd actually was not \nthe first cosponsor. Actually, Senator Sanford was my first cosponsor. \nThat only lasted 3 or 4 months, and then Senator Dodd came on board. We \nhave had nothing since then but a difficult battle. We have had \nadvertisements, we have had millions spent talking about what evil \npeople we are, how we are taking things away from the small investors \nof America. Who are we trying to protect? Obviously, not average folks.\n  I am very, very pleased that for once there was a countervailing \nmessage out there from people who know we have fixed some abuses that \nshould not go on in this country under the name of using the courts to \nprotect small investors. We do not have to have that kind of system. \nToday, if the vote goes right, we will strike--without question, we \nwill restore integrity to our securities litigation reform system--a \ngiant strike will be made for commonsense, reasonable litigation in \nAmerica, instead of litigation that goes to the extreme as far as the \nminds of bright lawyers can carry. There are many who think that is the \nway the system ought to evolve. I do not believe so. I do not think we \nought to put to work the genius of our minds in figuring out how to \nlitigate to get something out of the system. That is what I think has \nhappened. I think we will fix that.\n  There are 182 Members of the House from both sides of the aisle as \noriginal cosponsors. There were 52 in the U.S. Senate as original \ncosponsors. I must say, in all honesty, the bill is much better now \nthan when they cosponsored it. In fact, I must say it is even better \nfor that portion of the plaintiff's bar that chooses to participate in \nthis kind of litigation. It is better for them, too because they will \nbe forced to be better lawyers and to make the merits matter.\n  I came to the floor just to express a few remarks. We will be here \nfor perhaps a few hours. I also want to say the President's veto \nmessage leads me to conclude that we ought to pass this legislation. I \ndo not see in this message from the President a scathing attack on the \nlegislation. I see some very technical points. Frankly, a statement \nthat the managers report might go too far. I do not know--I say this \nwith a degree of caution, but I am not sure that I have seen a \nPresident veto a bill on the basis of what is in the statement of \nmanagers, but maybe I am wrong. I would not think Presidents would do \nthat. I do not think this President intended that. A statement of \nmanagers is not law, everyone knows that. Interpretation will evolve \nover time, without any question. There are more than 12,000 words in \nthis bill and the President quibbled with 11 of them. I know this \nbecause Senator Dodd did the analysis.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the October 31 letter from the third \ncircuit be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                            U.S. Court of Appeals,\n\n\n                                                Third Circuit,\n\n                                                 October 31, 1995.\n     Ms. Laura Unger,\n     Mr. Robert Giuffra,\n     Senate Committee on Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs, \n         Washington, DC\n       Dear Laura and Bob: I have a few suggestions for your \n     consideration on the Rule 11 issue.\n       Page 24, line 11: Insert ``complaint'' before ``responsive \n     pleading.''\n       Page 24, line 19: Insert ``substantial'' before \n     ``failure.''\n       ``Complaint'' would be added to item (i), so there is a \n     clear provision that reaches any failure of the complaint to \n     comply with Rule 11. A small offense would be met by \n     mandatory attorney fees and expenses caused by the offense; \n     if item (ii) is modified without this change, a gap is left \n     in the statutory scheme. The result still is a big change \n     from present Rule 11, which restricts an award of attorney \n     fees to a sanction ``imposed on motion and warranted for \n     effective deterrence.'' A serious offense--filing an \n     unfounded action--would be reached under item (ii).\n       I also wish to confirm our prior conversation on scienter \n     and the pleading requirement.\n       Page 31, line 5: Delete ``set forth all information'' and \n     insert in its place ``state with particularity.''\n       Page 31, line 12: Delete ``specifically allege'' and insert \n     in its place ``state with particularity.''\n       As I indicated, this would conform with the existing \n     language in Rule 9(b) which provides that ``the circumstances \n     constituting fraud or mistake shall be stated with \n     particularity.''\n       Also, page 24, line 1: Delete ``entering'' and substitute \n     ``making.''\n       Page 24, line 4: Delete ``of its finding.''\n       Many thanks.\n           Sincerely,\n                                               Anthony J. Scirica.\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I have sought recognition to amplify some \nof the comments and some of the issues which I had raised in the \nquestion I posed to the distinguished Senator from New Mexico.\n  The narrow issue which has been raised in the President's veto \nmessage is one of enormous importance but is generally not understood \nunless someone has delved into the intricacies of the legal pleadings, \nwhich are, candidly, not well known, not of very great interest, but \nare very, very important. The issue arises in a historical context \nwhere at common law lawsuits which had great merit on the substance \nwere thrown out of court because lawyers did not put in an adequate \nwritten pleading--a pleading is a document that is filed to start a \nlawsuit--because lawyers, acting on behalf of clients, did not put \nenough in the pleading to satisfy the requirements of law.\n  Most people do not really understand what the litigation process, the \ncivil litigation process is all about. There is enormous publicity on \nthe O.J. Simpson case, and television and radio and books talk a lot \nabout criminal trials, but very few really go into detail on what \nhappens in a civil lawsuit. But that is a process where one person sues \nanother, or corporations may be involved as parties, in order to assert \na cause of action or a claim for relief based on a civil wrong, where a \nremedy is sought. It may be money damages or an injunction to stop \nsomeone from doing something.\n  In the old common law, many people who had been severely injured were \nnot given a day in court because their lawyers did not put down the \nproper words. There is a famous textbook, Chitty on Pleading, to tell \nyou how to write the pleadings. These problems have been carried over \nto the present day. As a younger lawyer, I went to the prothonotary's \noffice in Philadelphia. On many occasions I had my complaints returned \nfor failure to go into the kind of specificity needed.\n  The leading architect, the draftsman of the Federal Rules of Civil \nProcedure, \n\n[[Page S19046]]\nwas a Yale Law School professor named Charles E. Clark. Charles E. \nClark later became the dean of the Yale Law School and he later became \na distinguished judge on the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit \nand ultimately was the Chief Judge there. Judge Clark felt so strongly \nabout civil procedure that he took time from his busy schedule to \ncontinue to teach a class at the Yale Law School long after he left as \ndean and was a distinguished Federal judge. I had the good fortune to \nhave Judge Clark as a professor on civil procedure.\n  Judge Clark, in a very eloquent way--and I wish he were on the floor \ntoday to talk about his deep feelings about procedure and the work that \nhe had done--spoke about the unfairness of having highly technical \nrules of pleadings which stop people who have valid claims from getting \ninto court. He developed, in the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, what \nis called ``notice pleading.'' It was a very famous case, DiGuardia \nversus Gurney, that involved a man who was injured, wrote something on \na slip of paper and filed it in Federal court, and that was sufficient \nto start a lawsuit, start the process. The defendant obviously \nobjected. He wanted a lot more specification. What he really wanted to \ndo was to win the lawsuit. He wanted to get the plaintiff, DiGuardia, \nout of court. But that is why we have judges who make decisions.\n  The distinguished Senator from New Mexico made a statement that ``the \nlawyers decide when cases are settled.'' It is not true. These class \naction cases are not settled until judges decide when the cases are \ngoing to be settled and when the cases are going to be concluded. These \nactions all require court approval. If one person sues another, he can \ndiscontinue the lawsuit by simply filing a praecipe, or paper saying \nthe lawsuit is over. But in class actions the lawyers do not decide \nthese matters, they are decided by judges. The Federal Rules of Civil \nProcedure were set up in an elaborate way to provide fairness, to give \nboth parties a fair chance.\n  There is an interesting editorial in today's USA Today, commenting \nabout this arcane, esoteric subject. The caption of it is, ``Sorry \nSecurities Law.'' The key sentence is, ``President Clinton did \nsomething smart this week. He sided with investors and taxpayers in a \nbattle for fair securities litigation reform.''\n  I ask unanimous consent this editorial be printed in the \nCongressional Record, following my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. SPECTER. The essence of my concern, albeit narrow, is very, very \nimportant, and that is what this conference report coming back from the \nconferees provides on how pleadings are articulated, bearing in mind \nthat this has an enormous impact, a controlling impact on the \nlitigation.\n  When this bill was before the Senate, I offered an amendment which \nwould give some direction to how plaintiffs met a very strong pleading \nrequirement, which was taken from the Federal Court of Appeals for the \nSecond Circuit. It has jurisdiction over New York, Vermont, and \nConnecticut, and many of the big security cases are brought there. \nEverybody agrees that the Second Circuit has articulated the toughest \nstandard around. That has been accepted.\n  When I read the decisions of the court of appeals, I noted that the \ncourt of appeals had pointed out how this tough standard could be \nsatisfied, and I offered an amendment, which was opposed by the \nmanagers. I had a little discussion with the distinguished Senator from \nUtah, Senator Bennett, who was managing the bill that day. And my \namendment was adopted by the Senate by a pretty convincing vote, 57 to \n42--which is a big vote around here, when the managers are opposed to \nit and you have about 60 cosponsors.\n  That amendment provided as follows:\n\n       The required state of mind may be established either by \n     alleging facts to show the defendant had both motive and \n     opportunity to commit fraud, or by alleging facts that \n     constitute strong circumstantial evidence of conscious \n     misbehavior or recklessness by the defendant.\n\n  That was adopted by a strong vote in this body. Why was it adopted? \nBecause, while the Senate agreed that we ought to have a tough standard \non pleading, the Senate said we ought to look to the same court which \nestablished that pleading standard which explained how the proof would \nbe made. But this important provision was dropped in the conference. \nThat means the conferees did not like it. There was a little feeding \nfrenzy as to how this legislation is finally crafted, in my opinion. \nThere is a little feeding frenzy going on in a lot of subjects in the \nCongress today.\n  Not only was this important provision dropped, but the conference \nreport came back and made it even tougher, saying that plaintiff had to \nplead ``with particularity'' the facts giving rise to a strong \ninference that the defendant acted with a certain state of mind.\n  This is a little tough, but I hope my colleagues, who will be voting \non this matter, will follow this, will listen to it--or the staffs \nwill.\n  In the context of what the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure provide, \nand these are worked out by the judges and by the rules committee of \nthe Judicial Conference after years of experience as to what is fair, \nrule 9(b) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure requires that fraud \nbe pleaded with particularity. That is where you have fraud.\n  But the same rule, when dealing with state of mind, says that the \nparticularity pleading is not required because it is unrealistic. That \nrule says that state of mind can be ``averred generally.'' Here we come \nback with legislation on this subject which virtually closes the \ncourthouse door to plaintiffs in legitimate cases, where there are very \nimportant issues and very important damages.\n  When the distinguished Senator from New Mexico, Senator Domenici, was \nsaying that hundreds of thousands of people will be pleased with \noverriding the President's veto, I would respond that millions of \nAmericans will be displeased when they understand that what the Senate \nhas done here is to make it virtually impossible for them to get a case \ninto Federal court.\n  These are not trivial matters. It is hard to comprehend the enormous \nbillions and trillions of dollars which we talk about in the Senate. \nThe gross national product of the United States of America--that is \nwhat everybody produces, all the cars, washing machines, and the \nservices--what everybody produces in this country amounts to $7 \ntrillion, everything that goes on in this country. The transactions on \nthe stock exchanges, the sale of stock, approximate $4 trillion.\n  We are not talking about a small group of lawyers, or a hundred \nthousand people who Senator Domenici says will be pleased if we \noverride the President's veto. We are talking about millions of people \nin America who invest in stocks and bonds and who need to be treated \nfairly. We are talking about the greatest country in the world with an \neconomic development which has developed a corporate mechanism, the \ncorporate machine for acquiring capital by stock offerings on the basis \nof fairness where we have laws which say what the offerors must do in \nterms of honest representations. These are matters involving enormous \nsums of money.\n  Just a few of the cases are:\n  Wedtech, which involved a matter where investors recovered $77 \nmillion of their losses which had exceeded more than $100 million in a \nclass action suit;\n  Platinum Software, where investors lost over $100 million, recovered \n$22 million in a class action suit against the company for overstating \nrevenues;\n  The famous Charles Keating, American Continental, Lincoln Savings \ncase where a jury awarded $4.4 billion against Mr. Keating and others \nfor fraud;\n  The Drexel Burnham Lambert case where a New York securities law firm \nsettled the claims of 40,000 class members who had invested in \nmunicipal bonds underwritten by Drexel for $26.5 million. Drexel \nsubsequently went bankrupt in the aftermath of the Michael Milken \ninsider trading scandal;\n  A matter pending today involving investors in Orange County municipal \nbonds who lost more than $1.5 billion due to the high-risk trading and \ninvestment strategy pursued by Orange County, and suit is currently \npending;\n  Hedged Investments Associates, a $40 million settlement against \nKidder, Peabody and Morgan Stanley to resolve a class action brought on \nbehalf \n\n[[Page S19047]]\nof 1,000 investors, mostly elderly retirees who had sustained losses of \n$72 million where there was a Ponzi-like scheme;\n  The case of LA Gear, an athletic equipment maker, a class action \nsettled for over $35 million to resolve a suit over allegations of a \nfalse public statement about stock value;\n  Chambers Development suit settled for $75 million on allegations of \nfalse statements by management over corporate earnings and accounting \nmethods;\n  The Washington Public Power Supply System, 26,000 investors were \ndefrauded of over $2 billion for fraud in selling bonds using false \ninformation, and over $800 million was recovered in a class action \nsuit.\n  This is a very brief statement illustrating the kind of problems for \nwhich these cases are brought.\n  Let me point out, Mr. President, that President Clinton has committed \nto signing the bill with three changes which would leave the reform \nprogram provisions essentially intact.\n  There would be reform of joint liability, which has been urged by \nmany. That stays in. Safe harbor for forward-looking nonfraudulent \nstatements which turn out to be incorrect--that change stays in. The \nelimination of liability under RICO, something which should have been \nchanged a long time ago, stays in. Procedural changes to make certain \nthat the plaintiffs, rather than their attorneys, control the \nlitigation stays in.\n  The Wall Street Journal has an interesting comment in today's edition \nsaying that only one of the three major--let me read a paragraph. It is \nrelatively brief. ``While supporters [that is, supporters for the bill] \nweren't admitting it publicly yesterday, only one of the three major \ninterest groups pushing the bill, the high technology companies often \ntargeted for fraud suits, regard the bill's strict pleadings standards \nas essential. The other two groups, accounting and securities firms, \nare more interested in other aspects of the lawsuit-limiting bill such \nas limits on their financial liability.'' And those would all be \nretained.\n  President Clinton went into this pleading issue in some detail. He \nfiled a short three-page veto message. But I can personally attest to \nthe thoroughness of the President's analysis of this issue because he \ncalled me on Tuesday night, night before last, rather late, 10:15 at \nnight, and told me that he was issuing a veto message and made a \ncomment that a letter which I had written him on December 8 this year \nhad brought to his attention matters that he had not previously \nunderstood.\n  The letter which I wrote to him said, in part, that I urged the veto \nbecause of the restrictive method of pleading scienter; that is, \nknowledge on the behalf of the defendants, and talking about the \nsanctions which could be applied and the strong limitations on \nplaintiffs' suits where you have this extraordinary standard of \npleading, the short statute of limitations, and the mandatory review \nfor sanctions under rule 11, which would so discourage any litigation \nfrom being brought. And, at the bottom of the letter, I printed in \nlonghand this note: ``Going back to my roots on studying this issue at \nthe Yale Law School, I think that my Federal procedure professor--Judge \nCharles Clark--would roll over in his grave to see the specific \npleading standard in this bill, prohibition on discovery until a motion \nto dismiss is denied, and the chilling sanctions. Your veto would send \nit back for important revisions.''\n  When the President called--and we had a conversation lasting about \nhalf an hour--he went in into these pleading provisions in detail, and \ntalked about his own procedure professor at the Yale Law School, fully \nunderstood precisely what he was doing, and said in his veto message \nthat he was prepared to sign the bill and supported the goals of the \nbill but thought it unfair to virtually close the courthouse door with \nthese requirements.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the following documents \nbe printed in the Record following my statement:\n  No. 1. My letter to the President dated December 8, 1995;\n  No. 2. The President's veto message dated December 19;\n  No. 3. My ``Dear Colleague'' letter dated December 20;\n  No. 4. The article in the Wall Street Journal of today, December 21; \nand\n  No. 5. The editorial in USA Today dated December 21, today.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibits 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5.)\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, in conclusion, the two most popular words \nof any speech, I ask my colleagues and the staffs just to take a look \nat what we are doing here. The President is prepared to sign a bill and \nto sign into law very substantial changes in the securities fields \nwhich have been urged and would become law--limitations on joint \nliability, reforms, so-called, in the safe harbor provisions, the \nelimination of liability under RICO--and I have had many people, \nespecially the accountants, urge that change be made--procedural \nchanges to ensure plaintiffs, not their attorneys, control the \nlitigation; really very major and enormous changes.\n  But this one provision as to how you state your case is just \nunfairly, unduly restrictive in this bill because it turns the Federal \nRules of Civil Procedure on their head. It turns in a revolutionary \nway--more than revolutionary, really destructively revolutionary--the \nestablished rules of notice pleading. It strikes the amendment which \nthis body had adopted on my introduction telling people how to meet the \ntough standard of specific pleading and then adds to it a particularity \nrequirement which makes it a virtual impossibility that sufficient \nfacts can be alleged and in a unique way cuts off discovery. The only \nsituation like it that I know about. It mandates the cut off of \ndiscovery when a motion to dismiss is pending, because \ncharacteristically and especially when you want to get inside \nsomebody's head you cannot do it unless you ask them a question or two.\n  So this is something of really enormous importance. What we would be \ndoing in effect is returning to a common law pleading standard, the \ncommon law of ancient England, probably even tougher than common law in \nancient England, which would be closing the courthouse doors on \nmillions of Americans who invest their money. And the long-range effect \nof what it does to the lawyers is minuscule but not what it will do to \ninvestors and what it will do to capital formation in the United \nStates. So I think that if we make these changes, simple but critical, \nas the President has said he will sign this law and we can move forward \nin a fair way.\n  I thank the Chair. I yield the floor.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n                    [From USA Today, Dec. 21, 1995]\n\n                          Sorry Securities Law\n\n       Caught between two big Democratic Party contributors--trial \n     attorneys and new high-tech companies, President Clinton did \n     something smart this week. He sided with investors and \n     taxpayers in a battle for fair securities-litigation reform.\n       Clinton vetoed a bill aimed at limiting frivolous lawsuits \n     against corporations that simply went too far.\n       As passed last week, the legislation gave a deserving slap \n     to a group of trial attorneys who've literally paid people to \n     start class-action suits against companies whose stocks \n     decline dramatically.\n       To defend against such suits, companies on average pay \n     $700,000 in attorney fees and lose nearly a half-year's worth \n     of top managers' time. Such high costs especially threaten \n     new high-tech firms. All of Silicon Valley's young \n     electronics companies report being hit by so-called strike \n     suits.\n       Legitimate investors aren't helped either when lawsuits \n     harass a company in which they've put money.\n       The bill would benefit investors and business by allowing \n     executives to speak more freely about their plans with less \n     fear of suits if the plans go sour.\n       That's what securities reform was supposed to be about. But \n     the legislation Clinton vetoed leapt beyond that with \n     provisions that would open the door to fraud.\n       For example, the bill would allow executives to knowingly \n     deceive investors as long as they included general cautions \n     while hyping products. Thus, a drug company executive talking \n     up a new drug could keep from investors the fact that the \n     government had denied approval of it without risking suit as \n     long as he noted the uncertainty of the drug approval \n     process.\n       Worse, the legislation also would require investors to \n     provide proof of intent to commit fraud when a complaint is \n     filed. That standard would have kept the government from \n     recovering money from Charles Keating and other savings and \n     loan crooks for their billions of dollars in fraud against \n     depositors and taxpayers.\n       Those problems are easily remedied. As Sen. Arlen Specter, \n     R-Pa., argues, plaintiffs aren't mind readers. They should \n     only have to show motive and opportunity to commit \n\n[[Page S19048]]\n     fraud to lodge a complaint. And honest executives and businesses don't \n     need a safe harbor for lies.\n       Wednesday, the House foolishly rejected those quick Clinton \n     fixes to the bill and voted to override the veto. The Senate \n     should take Clinton up on them.\n       Securities laws need to be fair to all, starting with \n     investors and taxpayers.\n\n                               Exhibit 2\n\n                                                      U.S. Senate,\n\n\n                                   Committee on the Judiciary,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, December 8, 1995.\n     The President,\n     The White House, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. President: This week, both the Senate and the \n     House of Representatives passed the conference report to H.R. \n     1058, the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.\n       I urge you to veto this conference report. While the bill \n     contains some reasonable provisions to eliminate frivolous \n     securities suits, it goes too far. The bill fails to extend \n     the statute of limitations shortened by the Supreme Court \n     several years ago. It imposes a highly restrictive method for \n     pleading scienter. It provides a mandatory stay of discovery \n     when a motion to dismiss is filed, thereby preventing \n     plaintiffs from discovering salient facts that would allow \n     them to amend their complaints to satisfy the new pleading \n     standard. It requires mandatory review at the completion of \n     each case for sanctions under Rule 11 of the Federal Rules of \n     Civil Procedure and, in what amounts to fee-shifting, \n     provides a presumption that the remedy for any Rule 11 \n     violation in the complaint is reimbursement of the \n     defendants' attorneys' fees.\n       As a practical matter, this combination of factors will \n     choke off many important law suits to protect innocent \n     investors. In very few cases will either potential plaintiffs \n     or their lawyers have a sufficient interest to justify \n     risking sanctions because, after the fact, a judge decides \n     that they may have violated a stringent and arbitrary \n     pleading standard. I fear that enactment of this bill would \n     represent the end of the private enforcement of the nation's \n     securities laws, which have provided the most stable markets \n     in the world.\n       I assure you that in the event that you veto this bill, I \n     will support your veto and work to defeat any override \n     effort.\n       Thank you for your consideration.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                    Arlen Specter.\n\n                               Exhibit 3\n\n       To the House of Representatives:\n       I am returning herewith without my approval H.R. 1058, the \n     ``Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.'' This \n     legislation is designed to reform portions of the Federal \n     securities laws to end frivolous lawsuits and to ensure that \n     investors receive the best possible information by reducing \n     the litigation risk to companies that make forward-looking \n     statements.\n       I support those goals. Indeed, I made clear my willingness \n     to support the bill passed by the Senate with appropriate \n     ``safe harbor'' language, even though it did not include \n     certain provisions that I favor--such as enhanced provisions \n     with respect to joint and several liability, aider and \n     abettor liability, and statute of limitations.\n       I am not, however, willing up to sign legislation that will \n     have the effect of closing the courthouse door on investors \n     who have legitimate claims. Those who are the victims of \n     fraud should have resource in our courts. Unfortunately, \n     changes made in this bill during conference could well \n     prevent that.\n       This country is blessed by strong and vibrant markets and I \n     believe that they function best when corporations can raise \n     capital by providing investors with their best good-faith \n     assessment of future prospects, without fear of costly, \n     unwarranted litigation. But I also know that our markets are \n     as strong and effective as they are because they operate--and \n     are seen to operate--with integrity. I believe that this \n     bill, as modified in conference, could erode this crucial \n     basis of our markets' strength.\n       Specifically, I object to the following elements of this \n     bill. First, I believe that the pleading requirements of the \n     Conference Report with regard to defendant's state of mind \n     impose an unacceptable procedural hurdle to meritorious \n     claims being heard in Federal courts. I am prepared to \n     support the standards of the Second Circuit, but I am not \n     prepared to go beyond that. Second, remove the language in \n     the Statement of Managers that waters down the nature of the \n     cautionary language that must be included to make the safe \n     harbor safe. Third, restore the Rule 11 language to that of \n     the Senate bill.\n       While it is true that innocent companies are hurt by \n     frivolous lawsuits and that valuable information may be \n     withheld from investors when companies fear the risk of such \n     suits, it is also true that there are innocent investors who \n     are defrauded and who are able to recover their losses only \n     because they can go to court. It is appropriate to change the \n     law to ensure that companies can make reasonable statements \n     and future projections without getting sued every time \n     earnings turn out to be lower than expected or stock prices \n     drop. But it is not appropriate to erect procedural barriers \n     that will keep wrongly injured persons from having their day \n     in court.\n       I ask the Congress to send me a bill promptly that will put \n     an end to litigation abuses while still protecting the \n     legitimate rights of ordinary investors. I will sign such a \n     bill as soon as it reaches my desk.\n                                               William J. Clinton.\n       The White House, December 19, 1995.\n\n                               Exhibit 4\n\n                                                      U.S. Senate,\n\n\n                                   Committee on the Judiciary,\n\n                                Washington, DC, December 20, 1995.\n       Dear Colleague: I urge you to sustain the President's veto \n     on the Securities Bill.\n       The President vetoed the Conference Report because it \n     significantly changed the Senate's version of the Bill. If \n     the Senate changes three provisions, the President has \n     committed to signing a revised Bill which would contain most \n     of the legislative reforms such as: reform of joint \n     liability; safe harbor for forward-looking nonfraudulent \n     statements which turn out to be incorrect; elimination of \n     liability under RICO; procedural changes to insure that \n     plaintiffs, not their attorneys, control cases.\n       The President vetoed the Conference Report because it \n     established virtually impossible pleading requirements. The \n     President accepted the toughest pleading standard of the \n     Second Circuit on the defendant's state of mind, but the \n     President wanted the Bill to include my amendment (adopted by \n     the Senate 57 to 42) which codified the Second Circuit's \n     standard on how that state of mind could be proved.\n       That tough pleading standard becomes even more important in \n     the context that the Bill prohibits discovery while the \n     defendant's motion to dismiss is pending. That means that the \n     plaintiff must specify his entire case without the benefit of \n     discovery. That is a virtually impossible pleading standard \n     which turns the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure on their \n     head.\n       The Conference Report's safe harbor provision excludes \n     liability for knowingly false forward-looking statements. The \n     President would sign a bill which retained the Senate's \n     version.\n       Sustaining the President's veto would retain most of the \n     reform measures in the Conference Report but will not close \n     the courthouse door to legitimate claims by these draconian \n     pleading standards.\n       Transactions on the stock exchanges now approximate $4 \n     trillion annually which is more than half the U.S. gross \n     national product.\n       Fairness to investors requires these revisions in the final \n     bill which would follow the Senate's sustaining the \n     President's veto.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                    Arlen Specter.\n\n                               Exhibit 5\n\n             [From the Wall Street Journal, Dec. 21, 1995]\n\n          House Votes To Override Veto of Securities-Suit Bill\n\n                          (By Jeffrey Taylor)\n\n       Washington.--The House voted 319-100 to override President \n     Clinton's unexpected veto of a bill restricting investors' \n     securities-fraud lawsuits, but the bill's supporters may find \n     an override harder to come by in the Senate\n       Late Tuesday night, Mr. Clinton stunned a coalition of \n     publicly owned companies, accountants and securities firms \n     advocating the bill by vetoing the legislation--after \n     indicating earlier that he planned to sign it. The bill would \n     make it harder for investors to file lawsuits seeking damages \n     when companies' stock prices drop and would limit the \n     liability of accountants and underwriters for fraud by their \n     corporate clients.\n       An override vote in the Senate may come as early as today. \n     White House aides expressed confidence that Mr. Clinton's \n     legislative staff could muster enough votes to defeat it. The \n     Senate approved the final version of the bill two weeks ago \n     by a 65-30 vote, barely enough for the two-thirds margin \n     needed for an override. Both sides in the debate spent much \n     of yesterday lobbying five senators who voted for the bill \n     but are seen as swing votes.\n       In addition to his usual Republican adversaries, the \n     president faces some unaccustomed opponents in the override \n     fight including Sen. Christopher Dodd (D., Conn.), the \n     Democratic National Committee chairman who aggressively \n     supports the bill. In a speech to House Democrats yesterday \n     morning, Sen. Dodd urged them to vote for their body's \n     override. And in a terse public statement, Mr. Dodd vowed to \n     ``work hard . . . to enact this legislation into law,'' which \n     would amount to a defeat for his own party's president.\n       If the Senate override effort fails, the bill's supporters \n     may be forced to reshape the bill to conform with some of Mr. \n     Clinton's concerns about it. The first of these, the \n     president said in his veto message, was that the bill's so-\n     called pleading standards--or the facts investors must \n     establish so courts will let their lawsuits proceed--impose \n     ``an unacceptable procedural hurdle'' to many worthy lawsuits \n     in the federal-court system. Thus, he concluded, the \n     standards would damage the legal rights of defrauded \n     investors.\n       While supporters weren't admitting it publicly yesterday, \n     only one of the three major interest groups pushing the \n     bill--the high-technology companies often targeted for fraud \n     lawsuits--regards the bill's strict pleading standards as \n     essential. The other two groups--accounting and securities \n     firms--are more interested in other aspects of the lawsuit-\n     limiting bill, such as its limits on their financial \n     liability.\n       Mr. Clinton appears to have counted on that fact in \n     crafting his veto message. In it, he calls for restoration of \n     an amendment introduced by Sen. Arlen Specter (R., Pa.), who \n     opposes the bill, which would have softened \n\n[[Page S19049]]\n     the pleading standards. The amendment was approved by the Senate in \n     June but was dropped in subsequent negotiations to merge the \n     Senate bill with its House counterpart.\n       In a letter to Mr. Clinton this month, Sen. Specter urged \n     Mr. Clinton to veto the bill and, if he did, promised to help \n     defeat any override effort in the Senate. Sen. Specter, who \n     like Mr. Clinton is an alumnus of Yale Law School, said in \n     his letter that his former federal-procedure professor at \n     Yale would ``roll over in his grave to see the specific \n     pleading standard in the bill.''\n       In a statement issued before yesterday's House vote, Rep. \n     Christopher Cox (R., Calif.), one of the bill's architects \n     and most ardent supporters, dismissed the concerns raised in \n     Mr. Clinton's message and painted the veto as a concession to \n     class-action trial lawyers who oppose the bill. Mr. Clinton \n     vetoed the bill, Rep. Cox asserted, ``at the bidding of \n     securities lawyers who are some of his and the Democratic \n     Party's biggest donors.''\n       The President's message also criticized the managers' \n     statement that accompanied the bill, in which its \n     congressional supporters explained what their intentions were \n     in drafting it. Mr. Clinton complained about how the \n     managers' statement described a key provision of the bill \n     protecting companies from legal liability for their forecasts \n     about earnings and other matters. The statement, he said, \n     ``attempts to weaken the cautionary language'' the bill \n     requires for companies to describe factors that might skew \n     their forecasts.\n\n  Mr. BENNETT addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Kyl). The Senator from Utah is recognized.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Pennsylvania.\n  If we were not in the veto circumstance we are in, we might well be \nable to work out some of the issues that he raises. My only comment \nwith respect to some of the comments he made is to remind Senators that \nthis bill deals with forward-looking statements, not with fraud that is \ncommitted in terms of reporting inaccurate stock prices, earnings, \nasset value, et cetera. I hope Members of the Senate and any who are \nlistening will understand the point we have made over and over again, \nthat had this bill been in place at the time of Charles Keating's \ndefalcations this bill would not have prevented a class action suit \nagainst Charles Keating. Had this bill been in place at the time of the \nclass action suit brought in Orange County, this bill would not have \nprevented those class action suits.\n  There is a clear difference between fraud when one is making a false \nstatement about the performance in the past and forward-looking \nstatements where one is making predictions about the future. That is \none of the cruxes here of this argument that has been lost. People have \nstood in the Chamber again and again and said to those of us who are in \nsupport of this legislation, how can you support fraud on the part of \ncorporate executives? The answer is, we do not support fraud on the \npart of corporate executives. We have never supported fraud on the part \nof corporate executives.\n  If I may be somewhat predictive in my forward statements, Mr. \nPresident, I see charts that are being set up in the Chamber that we \nhave seen before which make this point, that investors are being \ndefrauded and therefore how can you support legislation that would \nsupport this kind of defrauding.\n  The fact is, stating it once again for the record, we are not talking \nabout the Charles Keatings of this world. We are not talking about that \nfor which Michael Milken was sent to jail, acts where information is \nhidden from investors or information is distorted to defraud and \nmislead investors. We are talking about the circumstance where an \nexecutive is asked a question about the future and gives his best \nanswer, and then after the fact, if the future does not come to pass \nthe way that executive had speculated, he gets sued.\n  If I may, Mr. President, I would like to put that in the context of \nthe present budget debate because that is so much on everybody's mind. \nWe are seeing estimates of the future that are coming out of the Office \nof Management and Budget. We are seeing estimates of the future that \nare coming out from the Congressional Budget Office. We are seeing \nestimates of the future that are coming out of the Mainstream \nBipartisan Coalition, with whom I met yesterday, about what the economy \nis going to do and what the budget is going to do. Without the \nprotection contained in this bill, if the Members of the Senate and the \nHouse, if, indeed, the President himself, were corporate executives \nmaking these estimates about the future, we would all be subject to \nclass action lawsuits if it turned out we were wrong.\n\n  I guarantee you, Mr. President, we are all wrong. The only thing I \nknow about the Congressional Budget Office projections for the future \nand the Office of Management and Budget projections for the future and \nthe President's projections for the future and my projections for the \nfuture is that we will all be wrong. The future is not knowable with \nany degree of certainty. If it were, we would all be rich because we \nwould all bet on the right side of every football game. We would all \nmake the right choices for every stock that was purchased. We would all \nbe rich because we could all predict the future with certainty.\n  None of us can, and yet that is the standard to which too many \nexecutives have been held in this arena: You said you were going to \nhave product x ready for us by September and you missed it by 30 days. \nWe are going to sue you for misleading us.\n  What protection does the executive have in that circumstance when \nthey say, Mr. Executive, when do you expect to have product x ready for \nmarket? He says, I will not tell you because if I say September and it \nturns out to be October, you are going to sue me. And if I say \nSeptember and it turns out to be August, you are going to sue me. So I \nwill not tell you. Well, how can I make an intelligent guess as to \nwhether or not I should invest in your company if you will not even \ntell me what you expect to happen? Tough luck.\n  That is what we have now, Mr. President. In the name of protecting \nthe investor, we are depriving the investor of the very best guesses so \nlabeled, estimates so labeled, conjectures so labeled, of the people \nwho know the most about the company. We are asking the investor to fly \neven more blind than they would be if they had those guesses.\n  So let us understand as we debate this that we are talking about \nprotecting people from lawsuits based on their inability to guess the \nfuture, not about protecting people from liars, cheats, and thieves. \nThe liars, cheats, and thieves will still be subjected to class action \nlawsuits and the class action lawsuits will still end up recovering \nmillions of dollars for investors. But if this legislation passes, \nhonest executives who want to share their best guesses of the future \nwith investors will be able to do so with the knowledge that if they \nhappen to be wrong and product x comes out in October rather than \nSeptember, they will not have to spend millions of the investors' money \nto pay off some professional plaintiff that has brought a suit against \nthem on the technicality that exists in the present circumstance.\n  Mr. President, I see that my colleagues are now prepared. I am happy \nto yield the floor to those who have a differing point of view.\n  Mrs. BOXER addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Thank you very much, Mr. President.\n  I think we have an opportunity here to make a bill better, to fix \nsome flaws in a bill that had the best of intentions when it started \nout, to make sure that we let people know if they are even thinking of \nfiling fraudulent, frivolous lawsuits that they should not even think \nabout it because they are not going to succeed in the end.\n  That is something I care a lot about. I represent a State that has a \nlot of businesses which have been hit by lawsuits that in many cases \nshould not have been filed. On the other hand, many of them should have \nbeen filed.\n  My concern here is for small investors. I do not worry about the \ngiant, wealthy investors who, frankly, can take a hit or two and not \nhave any problem. I am worried about those people who save for their \nretirement, who are basically in the middle class of this country, who \ncount on--the truth in deciding where to put their money so it is there \nfor their retirement.\n  If they do get hit with one of these problems, it means big trouble. \nWe saw it coming home to roost in the case of those who were defrauded \nby Charles Keating. We certainly do not want to pass a bill here--I do \nnot think any of us would--that would make it easier for the Charles \nKeatings of the world to succeed in defrauding unsuspecting investors. \nNobody wants that--nobody. \n\n[[Page S19050]]\n\n  Yet, we know that as this bill has been analyzed by the experts, by \nthe people in academia, by the people who know the law, by people who \nare really charged with protecting small investors, they are suggesting \nto us in very strong language that this is not a good bill.\n  The President heard those people, and I think it took some courage \nfor him to veto this legislation. I think this override vote is going \nto be very, very close. I do not know where it is going to come out. \nBut I hope, if Senators are making up their minds on this matter, that \nthey would read the President's veto statement. I think it is very \nclear as to what problems he sees. I hope, also, they will read some of \nthe many, many newspaper editorials that have appeared all across the \ncountry warning this Congress not to move forward with this bill.\n  Here is Money magazine. This is not a magazine of lawyers. As the \nSenator from New Mexico, Senator Domenici, said, ``Well, it is only the \nlawyers.'' This is Money magazine. It is very interested in this \neditorial in warning investors about this bill. ``Congress Aims at \nLawyers and Ends Up Shooting Small Investors in the Back.'' I just \nthink that sums it up.\n  We want to stop frivolous lawsuits. We want to stop anyone who would \nput a company through a lawsuit where there was no foundation for it. \nBut we do not want to in the end shoot small investors in the back. \nThey say:\n\n       At a time when massive securities fraud has become one of \n     this country's growth industries, this law would cheat \n     victims out of whatever chance they may have of getting their \n     money back * * *. In the final analysis, this legislation * * \n     * would actually be a grand slam for the sleaziest elements \n     of the financial industry at the expense of ordinary \n     investors.\n\n  Mr. President, that is strong language. What they are saying here is \nwhat I said when I began: we had a reason to take a look at all this. \nOur reason was frivolous lawsuits. And what we wound up doing is \nhurting small investors and creating a climate where the lowest of the \nlow, the people who prey on others, who count on information to make \ninvestment decisions, are going to be rewarded by this bill. We do not \nwant to do that, I believe.\n  I think what the President has done is to call our attention to the \nfailings of this bill. I was a stockbroker many, many years ago. I was \nquite young at the time. But the one thing I understood was that people \nrelied on me. It was a big responsibility. I often thought, you know, \nif you really did not have the best interests of the people in mind, \nyou could get these people in an awful lot of trouble. You could churn \ntheir investments so that you would get a commission. You could hurt \npeople.\n  It seems to me that type of person certainly is not the majority, but \nthey do exist. As a matter of fact, if you look at current trends, \nunfortunately, there are more and more of these people than we would \nlike to believe.\n  Here are some other newspapers. These are editors who have absolutely \nno stake in this from a financial point of view. As a matter of fact, \nmost newspapers tend to be more conservative, more conservative, more \nprobusiness than others. But look what they say.\n  ``Protecting Investors From Securities Fraud.'' This is the Oakland \nTribune.\n\n       Say you have a spare $1,000 or so, and don't want to salt \n     it away in a simple savings account. You hear about a \n     company's stock that is touted to go up because executives \n     are forecasting greatly increased earnings. You decide to use \n     your $1,000 to buy that company's stock based on the rosy \n     predictions of future earnings, but the earnings forecasts \n     turn out to be bogus. You learn the executives knew their \n     earnings forecast was unattainable, yet they hyped their \n     stock anyway. The stock price does not rise as the company's \n     executives hinted it would, and your $1,000 is not worth \n     $1,000 anymore, but less. And if you want to sue to recover \n     your losses--\n\n  They point out--\n\n     you can now. But if a House-Senate conference bill passes--\n\n  And that is what is before us, Mr. President--he basically says:\n\n     it will be much more difficult to do so--\n\n  Meaning to sue. And they call on President Clinton to veto the \nmeasure--\n\n     because it leaves individual investors and an array of \n     institutional investors, like pension funds, municipalities \n     and other Government units without enough protection from \n     manipulators like Charles Keating, Ivan Boesky and Michael \n     Milken.\n\n  They go on to explain the bill. And they talk about how in fact these \ncharlatans would really be popping their champagne in their boardrooms, \nin their homes tonight if we in fact do not sustain this veto.\n  Another editorial, the San Francisco Chronicle. The reason I think it \nis important, Mr. President, to read these is because, again, the way \nthis bill is presented to us by the people who want to pass it is as if \nthere were 90 lawyers in the entire country who really care about this, \nthat they control this debate. Clearly, I am going to prove by the type \nand number of examples that I raise here that is not the case.\n  ``Opening The Door To Fraud.'' And this says:\n\n       Legislation would wipe out important consumer protections. \n     Securities fraud lawsuits--\n\n  This is in the San Francisco Chronicle--\n\n       Securities fraud lawsuits are the primary means for \n     individuals, local governments and other investors to recover \n     losses from investment fraud, whether that fraud is related \n     to money, invested in stocks, bonds, mutual funds, individual \n     retirement accounts, pensions or employee benefit plans. As \n     the draft report stands--\n\n  That is essentially what is before us--\n\n     investors would be the losers, and their hopes of receiving \n     convictions in suits similar to those against such well-known \n     con men as Michael Milken and Ivan Boesky would be severely \n     hampered. In the name of the little guy, Clinton should not \n     let that happen.\n\n  Our President did not let that happen. Now there is a chance for us \nto stand up and be counted on behalf of the little guy, the little guy, \nthe small investor, those of us in America--and that is most of us--who \nare really in the middle class, who would be greatly hurt if in fact we \ndid not have the ability to go to court and to, if we were defrauded, \nhave a chance at recovering even some of our investment.\n  This is a Michigan headline, and I think it is pretty strong. ``How \nCome GOP's `Contract' Allows Ripoffs Of Investors?'' The reason they \ntalk about it as the ``GOP contract''--and it is in many ways certainly \nsupported on both sides of the aisle--is that the contract contains \nlanguage that is in many ways the father of this bill. The Michigan \npaper says:\n\n       . . . let the bill's backers explain to the rest of us why \n     stock swindlers need to be ``protected'' from lawsuits.\n\n  This is in the Muskegon Chronicle in Michigan.\n  The fact is we can stop this bill now. We can start all over again \nwith a better bill. We can follow the advice of President Clinton. He \nhas given us for the record, many, many letters from experts in this \nfield who really convinced him that, in the end, this bill, as written, \nwould hurt middle-class investors.\n  We have a road map from the President of some of the things that we \ncan fix.\n  I would like to read a letter from the Fraternal Order of Police that \nI have to read before on this floor. It is a letter to the President:\n\n       On behalf of the National Fraternal Order of Police, I urge \n     you to veto the ``Securities Litigation Reform Act.'' The \n     single most significant result of this legislation would be \n     to create a privileged class of criminals. . . our 270,000 \n     members stand with you in your commitment to war on crime. I \n     urge you to reject a bill which would make it less risky for \n     white collar criminals to steal from police pension funds \n     while the police are risking their lives against violent \n     criminals.\n\n  I think this really says it all. Here is a letter written by police \nwho are protecting our lives, they are on the line, and they are \nworried that their pensions will not be protected because this bill \nwould make it possible for their pension plan to be raided and for them \nto lose their retirement funds.\n  Those who present this as an issue about special interests have a \nperfect right to do that, but I say to you, what we are doing goes \nquite beyond that. It termed called reform, but it overturns legal \nprotections that have been there for investors since the thirties. How \nquickly we seem to forget history, that people, small investors deserve \nand need this protection.\n  We do not need to do this so much for those who are wealthy. They are \nnot too worried about their being defrauded. But it is our small \ninvestors, \n\n[[Page S19051]]\nit is our people, particularly the elderly, who count on getting their \nretirement from these investments, that we should be protecting. The \nwealthiest do not need us to worry about them and, frankly, the very \npoor simply do not have the funds to make these investments. So I think \nthis is a vote on whether you are going to stand behind the middle \nclass, the small investor, or are you going to abandon them in the name \nof frivolous lawsuits, which is a wonderful and noble objective which, \nfrankly, has just gone awry.\n  The President vetoed this bill because I think he wants to stand with \nthe middle class. He is certainly standing with them in this budget \nfight, and there is a connection. When you fight for the elderly to \nprotect their Medicare, you are saying you care about these people. But \nat the same time, if you leave their pension plans open to raiding by \npeople like Keating and Boesky, and we know the cast of characters we \nhave seen come out of the eighties, then you are harming them. If you \nprotect their Medicare on the one hand, but you leave their pension \nplans and retirement savings prey to those that, frankly, would take \nadvantage of them only too quickly if they knew that the legal \nprotections have been changed, you abandon them.\n  So I say the bill, as it is currently, is against the middle class. \nThe bill targets small investors, the elderly and those saving for old \nage through their retirement.\n  Again, I do not think we can really bifurcate this argument from the \nrest of what we are trying to do. We stand here and we say we fight for \nthe middle class. We are fighting against those Medicare cuts, those \nMedicaid cuts to our elderly in nursing homes and to make sure that \nkids have access to college loans so their middle-class families can \nafford to send them to college. Protecting them from securities fraud \nis part of standing up and fighting for people who count on us and who \nrely on us.\n  Many of us stand up here and say we are not going to see a budget go \ninto effect that gives large tax cuts to the wealthiest among us while \nwe hurt our middle class by cutting all these other programs. There is \na nexus here. We should stand proudly for the small investor and those \nwho need us.\n  The President's three objections, I think, are very clearly stated in \nhis veto message. First of all, he talks about the bill's pleading \nstandards which he believes would make it virtually impossible for \nthose who have been defrauded to even bring a lawsuit in the first \nplace. I think this is very important, because the bill, as it \ncurrently stands, requires defrauded investors to know the state of \nmind of the people who defrauded them before they even file a lawsuit.\n  How can you possibly know what is in the heads of people you have \nnever even met? How can you prove what was in their minds before you \nhave had a chance to find out what, in fact, they did have on their \nminds when defrauding you? You cannot. That is an impossible standard.\n  The President was willing to accept a bill which adopted the most \ndifficult pleading standards adopted by any Federal Circuit Court of \nAppeals, and that is the second circuit. But what the President was not \nwilling to do, was to make those standards even more difficult.\n  That is very important. The President is not saying in his veto \nmessage this is a terrible thing, we should not even be looking at this \nbill. He is saying there are things wrong with it. One of them is its \npleading standards. In the President's own words,\n\n       the bill would erect a barrier so high that even the most \n     aggrieved investors with the most painful losses may get \n     tossed out of court before they have a chance to prove their \n     case.\n\n  The President was particularly concerned that the conference dropped \nan amendment overwhelmingly adopted by the U.S. Senate, an amendment \noffered by Senator Specter. I know Senator Specter was on the floor \ntalking about his amendment. It would have remedied the problem that \ntoo draconian a pleading standard would have created. The Specter \namendment would have allowed lawsuits to be filed if the defrauded \ninvestors could show that the defendant had the ``motive and \nopportunity'' to defraud them.\n  After that standard was met, the plaintiffs would be allowed to go \nforward and test whether the defendants actually defrauded them. But \nthe operative language here, ``motive and opportunity,'' would be the \nstandard, instead of the impossible standard where you have to describe \nthe mind of people you do not even know who have defrauded you, proving \nwhat was their state of mind before you can even get into the \ncourthouse.\n  That is not what American justice is all about. We are proud of our \nlegal system because its doors are open. They are open to the \nwealthiest. They are open to the poorest. This really would slam that \ndoor on the small investor. That is wrong.\n  The President also opposes the bill's draconian safe harbor which \npermits outright frauds as long as they are couched as predictions and \nestimates of future profits and income. The President is saying, if you \nallow companies who do not tell the truth to cover over outright lies \nusing ``predictions'' and ``estimates,'' then you are not giving these \ncompanies a safe harbor, but rather, what has been described on this \nfloor, as a ``pirate's cove'' filled with sharks and barracudas. You \nare going to have sharks and barracudas hiding in the safe harbor, \ncalling something a prediction and the investor, who is not \nsophisticated making an investment based on this very misleading \nlanguage.\n  Fraudulent future predictions and estimates would be permitted under \nthis bill if those defrauding attach ``some'' possible reasons why the \nprediction might not come true. Those defrauding can hide the real \nreason that their fraudulent prediction will not come true and they \ncannot be sued.\n  In other words, they know that what they are saying to unsuspecting \ninvestors is not true, but they couch it in terms such as ``this is a \nprediction,'' ``this is an estimate.'' Then they are home free \nprotected by the ``safe harbor'' from successful suit.\n  The President has been reasonable. He is willing to allow greater \nprotections for predictions and estimates of a company's prospects, but \nhe is not willing to permit outright fraud.\n  I think the President is being extremely reasonable when he says bill \nneeds to be changed. The safe harbor is the one change and the pleading \nrequirements are the other.\n  The President is also opposed to the bill's unfairly treating \nplaintiffs more harshly than defendants. That moves us toward a loser-\npay standard which we all say we do not think is a good thing but, \nfrankly, it is in this bill.\n  The bill creates a presumption that small investors must pay all of \nthe other side's legal fees if their initial fraud complaint violates \nrule 11 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, but it does not \nrequire defendants who violate that same rule in similar situations to \npay all of the plaintiff's legal fees. So what kind of justice is that? \nThat is so blatantly unfair, I do not even know how to express my \noutrage at that particular provision.\n  I do not happen to believe in loser-pays for either side. I just \nthink that is a way to basically send a message to people that they \ncould get stuck--mightily stuck--with large bills. They could be small \ninvestors or, frankly, small companies. I think that is totally wrong. \nThe fact is, we have a legal system that has worked pretty well, and I \nam very fearful that if we start introducing a modified version of \nloser-pays in this bill, there is no stopping it. I think that would be \na very dangerous thing to do.\n  If you are a very small investor and you think you have a really good \ncase, but you know if you have an unfriendly judge, for example, you \ncould get stuck paying the other side's legal fees, you might walk away \nand allow a real swindler to get off the hook. So this troubles the \nPresident, as well it should, and it troubles me, as well.\n  We believe, really, that small investors would be terrorized into not \nfiling lawsuits for fear of having to pay these legal fees of large \nwell-heeled corporate defendants who could run up very large legal \nbills. So for at least 100 years, the American court system has \nrejected loser-pays because it prevents aggrieved parties from \nasserting their rights.\n  I have already put into the Record today a number of newspaper \narticles. But I have to say, Mr. President, again, to those who try to \ndismiss the opposition of this bill, they are really not \n\n[[Page S19052]]\nbeing fair. It is true that everybody wants to stop frivolous lawsuits. \nSo it was hard for many of us to stand up and oppose this bill. But I \nhave to tell you, if you listen to some of the groups in the country \nwho oppose this bill, I think it would be an impressive list:\n  The Government Finance Officers Association [GFOA], a professional \nassociation of State and local government officials, both elected and \nappointed, whose duties include the investment of cash balances and \npension funds and issuance of municipal debt. These are the people who \nknow what is at stake here. The Government Finance Officers Association \nopposes this bill.\n  The U.S. Conference of Mayors opposes this bill. Why? Because they \nhave large security investments, including pension funds. For example, \nthe city of San Jose in California was completely ripped off by an \nunscrupulous broker many years ago. They were able to recover because \nwe had good laws on the books--laws that are going to be changed, and \ntheir city attorney came before our committee to testify and said it \nwould be very dangerous to change these laws.\n  Then there is the North American Securities Administrators \nAssociation, who represents the 50 States' securities regulators, \nresponsible for investor protection, and the efficient functioning of \nthe capital market at the grassroots level. The North American \nSecurities Administrators Association opposes this.\n  I have a letter from the California County Officials. They oppose \nthis.\n  The American Bar Association.\n  I just, Mr. President, fear very much that we will be back on this \nfloor if we cannot work this into a better bill, when the first scandal \nhits, with Senators saying, ``My God, I never knew, we did not mean it, \nand we have to take another look at this.'' You know that is going to \nhappen.\n  I think we should listen to the people in the local counties across \nour country. I think it is pretty effective. We have a letter signed by \n99 California government officials, including the mayors of San \nFrancisco, San Jose, and officials in 43 of our State's 58 counties. \nMr. President, I want to say that many of these counties who signed \nthis letter are extremely conservative local government officials. It \nis rare that they call me and are so united on such an issue.\n  I have, also, a letter signed by 34 county treasurers in Arkansas, 51 \npublic officials in Georgia, 58 public officials in Massachusetts, \nincluding the Massachusetts Association of County Commissioners. I have \na letter signed by 39 officials in New Jersey, including the New Jersey \nConference of Mayors and the New Jersey State League of Municipalities.\n  So it is very important. In this letter signed by California county \nofficials that I talked about, they say:\n\n       In recent years, local California governments, most notably \n     Orange County, have lost more than $2 billion in the \n     securities markets, partly due to derivative investments. \n     Some of these governments have pending securities fraud \n     cases; others are still deciding whether to use the courts to \n     pursue recovery of losses.\n       Now is not the time to weaken defrauded investors' rights \n     to pursue civil action, as would occur--\n\n  Under the bill that is pending before us--\n\n     unless institutional investors that are defrauded have the \n     ability to recover their losses in court, they will have to \n     make the unenviable choice [as Orange County did] between \n     cutting essential services, such as education programs, or \n     raising taxes.\n       We urge you to do the right thing and protect taxpayers' \n     investments from securities fraud and oppose this unbalanced, \n     unnecessary and dangerous legislation.\n\n  Again, this is from Fresno to Los Angeles to Riverside and Stanislaus \nCounty, Kings County, Tulare County, Yuba, Shasta, Monterey, Siskiyou, \nSierra. I am talking about counties from the city to the rural areas--\neverywhere. Inyo, Mariposa, Santa Ana, Fremont, Stockton, Riverside, \nOceanside, Elmonte, Thousand Oaks, Westminster, Newport Beach, Arcadia, \nBarstow, Contra Costa Water District, South Pasadena, South Tahoe \nPublic Utility District, city of Hemet, San Benito County, and others. \nMy State has 31 million people in it--31 million people in it, Mr. \nPresident. Every time we do something here, it affects my State more \nthan any other State just by virtue of that fact. To have these \nRepublican and Democratic elected officials be so united in their \nopposition is very, very unusual. Retirement associations all \nthroughout the State, including my home county of Marin, where I served \non the county board of supervisors--they are very conservative--they do \nnot want to see us weaken these laws.\n  The American Bar Association, their new president, Roberta Ramo, has \nwritten an excellent letter to the President outlining their problems \nwith this bill.\n  I want to conclude my remarks, Mr. President, by saying this: Again, \nmy State represents a lot of the companies that have legitimate \nproblems with frivolous lawsuits. I promised those companies I would do \neverything I can to work on legislation that really addressed their \nproblems. I do not want to see anything hurt decent business people. On \nthe other hand, I want a balanced bill and one that does not go so far \nthat the charlatans that may be stockbrokers, investment advisers, \ncorporations--we have seen them so much in the 1980's, and we see more \nnow--we do not want to open the door to that kind of investor fraud.\n  I think the President took a strong stand to protect the middle-class \ninvestors. I applaud him. I hope we can in fact sustain that veto. I \nknow if we do, it will be very close one way or the other, if we fail \nor if we succeed. But I have to say this: What is at stake here is \nreally, I think, in the long run, the health of the securities markets. \nThe worst thing we can do is have a situation where the laws on our \nbooks have been weakened to a point where they do not provide investor \nconfidence. People will not invest their money, and we will have a \nsituation where decent companies are going to have to pay a premium--it \nis really a premium--in order to convince people to invest with them. \nThat will cost these good companies more money. They will have to pay \nmore interest to these investors because many investors, as soon as we \nhave that first scandal, are going to say, ``You know what? Maybe I am \nbetter off with Government bonds. Maybe I am just better off getting a \ncertificate of deposit that is insured by the Federal Government.''\n  So that would be the worst thing that could happen, in the long run--\nif we try to address one problem, frivolous lawsuits, and weaken our \nlaws to such a point that people do not have confidence to invest their \nmoney in the market.\n  So I hope we will stand with the President. He has really laid out a \nclear path on how to fix this bill. I want to thank Senator Bryan and \nSenator Sarbanes.\n  I have been proud to be on their time as we have tried to bring these \nissues to the President's attention, to our colleague's attention and \nfrankly to the attention of the American people. I hope we will sustain \nthis veto. I yield the floor.\n  (Mr. CAMPBELL assumed the chair.)\n  Mr. GRAMS. As a conferee for this bill, I am here on the floor today \nto also join those others in urging my colleagues to vote to override \nthe President's--what I consider--ill-advised veto of the conference \nreport on securities litigation reform.\n  Back on December 5, 65 of us voted in favor of the conference report \nthat the President has now vetoed. Mr. President, 69 of us voted for S. \n240, which was substantially similar to the conference report.\n  Now, the principal authors of this legislation are Senators D'Amato, \nSenator Dodd, and Senator Domenici. These Senators put aside their \npolitical and partisan differences to do something right for small \ninvestors, for workers and for the consumer. All of us did. When you \nhave legislation that is authored and supported by the general chairman \nof the Democratic National Committee and the chairman of the Republican \nSenatorial Committee, I believe that is what you would call compromise. \nWhen you have almost 70 Senators from both sides of the aisle voting \nfor this legislation, that is also called compromise. So, why did the \nPresident veto this measure?\n  Well, in his letter accompanying the veto, the President said that he \nwants to protect innocent investors from being defrauded. Well, this \nlegislation protects those investors. It preserves the right of these \ninvestors who are truly victimized by securities fraud, but it does \nmuch more than that, as \n\n[[Page S19053]]\nwell. It also will protect the worker who is out there and worried \nabout being laid off because his employer had to pay attorney's fees \ninstead of being able to pay his salary.\n  It will help the consumer who has to pay higher prices for products \ntoday because of the hidden costs of frivolous legislation and \nlitigation.\n  It will pay off for the legitimate investors and for the pensioners \nwhose life savings are being jeopardized by strike-suit attorneys.\n  Finally, it will also benefit the thousands of honest, hard-working \nattorneys who have watched the public image of their profession being \ntarnished by a few greedy quick change artists.\n  It is also for the sake of those Americans that we have put in long \nhours of hard work to craft what I believe is a very balanced and \nreasonable bill.\n  The only people who will lose under this legislation are the small \nclass of attorneys who have used professional plaintiffs to file \nfrivolous and meritless suits, again just to make a quick dollar. They \nuse joint and several liability to bring secondary defendants into \ntheir cases simply to try and extort a higher settlement out of them as \nwell.\n  Now, the social costs of these suits are very, very high. Again, they \nwould result in fewer jobs because employers would be paying high costs \nfor frivolous litigation, rather than being able to put that money \nwhere it would make a difference, and that is in the higher salaries or \nmore jobs. Higher prices for the consumers who end up having to pay \nthese costs because they are passed along in the cost of doing \nbusiness. They go into the products and the services that these people \nprovide, so consumers end up paying more because, again, of the costs--\nthe hidden costs--of frivolous litigation, and it has diminished \nreturns for the innocent investors. The very investors that the \nPresident says he wants to help protect are the ones who would benefit \nfrom this bill, as well.\n\n  What do investors get in return for those abusive lawsuits? In the \npast they have received about 6 cents on the dollar that has gone back \nto the victims. The rest has gone into litigation, legal expenses and \nlawyer's fees. Who is the President really trying to protect? \nInvestors, the consumers, or the workers, or a small group of unethical \nlawyers? I think that answer was obvious.\n  Legislation is not meant to protect political constituencies. When we \ndo the work of the people we should think of what the voters called for \nin the last election--not the commercials that consultants will be \nrunning in the next election. That is not what the President did when \nhe vetoed this bill. We should not stand for it as well.\n  For those reasons and for the sake of the small investors and the \nconsumers, the job creators and the workers, we should override this \nveto, because if the White House will not stand up for these \nindividuals, who will? We must. I believe that we will.\n  Again, I urge my colleagues to override the veto and to enact the \ncommonsense legal reform that is contained in this bill. I yield the \nfloor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah [Mr. Hatch] is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. HATCH. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, on December 19, 1995, President Clinton vetoed the \nconference report to H.R. 1058, the Securities Litigation Reform Act of \n1995. This act represents a very modest step forward in addressing some \nof the egregious abuses present in our litigation system today. In \ndoing so, I believe President Clinton has sided with a handful of very \nwealthy lawyers and against the interests of the American people at \nlarge. President Clinton is a tenacious defender of the status quo. I \ndo not think the status quo is serving us well.\n  The securities bill was developed over the past several Congresses by \na dedicated, bipartisan, moderate group of reformers who have long seen \nthe need to change our securities litigation system. Senators \nChristopher Dodd and Pete Domenici have led this effort for a number of \nyears and finally saw the opportunity for meaningful reform in this \nCongress.\n  The securities litigation conference report passed the Senate by a \nbipartisan vote of 65 to 30. A total of 19 of our colleagues on the \nother side of the aisle voted in support of this moderate and \nmeaningful bill.\n  The legislation sought to make securities litigation fairer by \ncurbing the abusive litigation practices that have been employed by a \nsmall number of plaintiffs lawyers in securities litigation class \naction lawsuits. That very small group of trial lawyers who specialize \nin securities litigation lawsuits represents the only ones who are \ntruly hurt by the securities litigation reform bill. Likewise, they are \nthe only ones who are helped by the President's veto--just a few, very \nwealthy litigation lawyers in the field of securities law.\n  The plaintiffs lawyers who benefit from the President's veto are the \nones who perfected the so-called strike suits. Strike suits are filed \nagainst companies after a drop in the stock price, frequently without \nregard to whether there has been any fraud or wrongdoing on the part of \nthe company. And by the time the suit really gets in full swing, the \nlitigation is so expensive for the companies that many of these \ncompanies just settle for defense costs to get rid of the problem and \nthe embarrassment, and to not have to take a chance with some of the \njuries in some of the more, shall we say, jury-liberal States in our \ncountry.\n  For example, in 1990, when LA Gear, the sportswear and sneaker \nmanufacturer, announced lower than expected earnings, one law firm \nfiled 15 lawsuits just 3 days after the announcement.\n  The Banking Committee heard testimony concerning other cases in which \nsecurities lawsuits were filed within 90 minutes of the drop in share \nprices. These kinds of filings without regard to the merits are \nridiculous. They are hurting American businesses and consumers.\n  I am particularly concerned because perhaps hardest hit have been \nhigh-technology companies. Those companies form a key part of the \nAmerican economy and are vitally important to the economies of Utah and \nmany other States. They are being disproportionately hurt by these \nlawsuits.\n  A Stanford University law professor, conducting a study of securities \nclass action lawsuits filed in the 1980's, most involving high-\ntechnology firms, found that every single company, every single high-\ntechnology firm that experienced a market loss in stock price of at \nleast $20 million was sued. Every single company. Those kinds of abuses \nare an outrage and an affront to the legal system. These are some of \nthe most successful American companies, and they are being besieged \nwith lawsuits. Some think it should be called legal extortion. It \nsimply cannot be that every single high-technology firm that has \nsuffered a $20 million or more loss is engaged in securities fraud. It \njust is not true. But by the time the lawsuits start and the litigation \nbegins, and the depositions start and the discovery becomes burdensome \nand onerous, a lot of companies just throw up their hands in the air \nand pay whatever they have to to get out of it because they know that \nkind of litigation is never ending.\n  The current litigation system encourages wasteful and needless \nlitigation even where there is absolutely no evidence of wrongdoing. \nThe unavoidable fact is that because of current skewed incentives in \nthe litigation system, the small group of lawyers who file most strike \nsuits are not filing such suits to protect shareholders against \ncorporate fraud and wrongdoing. They are doing so to line their own \npockets.\n  I happen to be a lawyer. I happen to understand securities law. And I \ncan tell you that is what is happening. The Banking Committee heard \ntestimony that plaintiffs in these suits typically receive only 14 \ncents for every dollar while the trial lawyers collect a whopping 39 \npercent of these settlements. That is abominable and everybody knows \nit. Other studies have suggested even lower plaintiff recoveries. We \nare talking about the people who are supposedly wronged getting 14 \ncents out of every dollar while the attorneys get 39 cents out of every \ndollar.\n  These lawyers are filing these lawsuits so that they can terrorize \nAmerican companies into paying exorbitant settlements because they know \nthese companies cannot afford the high legal fees that would be \nrequired to defend themselves even against meritless lawsuits.\n  When companies must pay for needless litigation, settlement and \ninsurance costs with dollars that could be \n\n[[Page S19054]]\ngoing to create jobs or to further research and development, consumers \nand stockholders, virtually all Americans in fact are hurt. Due to \nwasted resources, profits and stock prices are lower than they would \notherwise be and the shareholders in the end lose out. That should not \nbe lost in this debate.\n  The truth is that shareholders are very well protected under the \nsecurities laws and under this securities bill. This legislation \nensures that the class action device remains available for those \nshareholders who have been in fact victims of securities fraud. In \nfact, it improves that device so that injured investors, not a small \ngroup of greedy lawyers, can control the litigation.\n  Although the President pointed to what he claimed are a number of \nshortcomings in the bill that justify his veto, his excuses are just \nthat--slender excuses for siding with some of these jackal lawyers.\n  First, the President nitpicked with the bill's pleading requirements. \nHowever, legislative history in the House and Senate makes clear why a \nheightened standard requiring pleading with particularity is necessary \nto eliminate securities lawsuit abuses. The conference report sensibly \nrequires a heightened pleading standard to weed out frivolous \nlitigation and to free parties against whom claims are made from being \nsubject to abusive and expensive discovery.\n  Second, the President went after the safe harbor provision, which \ncreates a safe harbor for forward-looking, predictive statements. Some \ncompanies have faced damaging lawsuits merely on the basis of vague but \noptimistic projections that the company would do well even though it \nwas clear that the prediction was speculative and future oriented. The \nsafe harbor provision sensibly addresses those problems.\n  In fact, President Clinton notes that he supports the conference \nreport language but is concerned with some language in the statement of \nthe managers of the bill on this provision. Now, the Constitution gives \nthe President the authority to veto legislation, but nowhere does it \ngive the President authority to veto legislative history. I think a \nveto on the grounds of legislative history in this case is extreme, \nespecially in light of the clear language of the bill.\n  In short, President Clinton was stretching for excuses to veto this \nlegislation. The only thing President Clinton has shown with his veto \nof the securities litigation reform bill is that he will side with a \nhandful of trial lawyers against the interests of all Americans--\nespecially American consumers and shareholders. He has proven that he \nis not an agent of meaningful and needed change but instead a tenacious \ndefender of the status quo.\n  I encourage my colleagues to override his veto so we can provide \nmeaningful change to Americans who are fed up with lawsuit abuse in \nthis country. My good friend and colleague from Pennsylvania has joined \nthe Clinton administration in questioning the pleadings standards \ncontained in this bill. I should note, for the record, that in June of \nthis year this very administration that has vetoed this bill called the \nbill's pleadings standards ``sensible'' or ``workable.'' I would also \nnote that these pleadings standards were based, in part, on the \nrecommendations of Judge Anthony Scirica of the Third Circuit Court of \nAppeals.\n  Mr. President, I ask that the June administration policy statement \nand an October 31 letter from Judge Scirica be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                   Statement of Administration Policy\n\n       The Administration supports appropriate reforms of the \n     federal securities laws. The goal should be to and litigation \n     abuses and to clarify the law, without improperly limiting \n     the rights of investors to pursue civil actions against \n     financial fraud.\n       As reported by the Senate Banking Committee, S. 240 \n     contains a number of provisions designed to end litigation \n     abuses which the Administration endorses. A number of its \n     original provisions that had been the focus of committee \n     discussions have been modified appropriately or deleted. S. \n     240 is now a substantial improvement on H.R. 1058, which the \n     Administration could not support. For instance, S. 240 \n     rejects certain of H.R. 1058's egregious provisions, such as \n     its ``loser-pays'' approach and its too-stringent definition \n     of recklessness. At the same time, S. 240 adopts several \n     sensible provisions, including a workable pleading standard \n     taken from the Second Circuit, and appropriate class action \n     reform provisions.\n       The Administration recommends the following modifications \n     to two provisions in the bill:\n       Safe Harbor--The Administration supports the Committee's \n     attempt to craft a statutory safe harbor that would encourage \n     the dissemination of forward--looking statements without \n     protecting statements made with an intent to mislead. The \n     Administration does not believe a safe harbor should protect \n     statements known to be materially false or misleading when \n     made. The Senate should clarify whether the safe harbor's \n     current language would protect such statements.\n       Proportionate Liability--The Administration opposes the \n     bill's provision that would establish proportionate liability \n     for reckless defendants because in cases involving insolvent \n     defendants, the provision would leave investors unable to \n     recover their full damages. Culpable solvent defendants, \n     rather than defrauded investor, should at least bear a \n     substantial portion of this noncollection risk. Accordingly, \n     the Administration supports an amendment that would require \n     culpable solvent defendants to pay up to twice their \n     proportionate share of damages (rather than 150 percent as in \n     the Committee bill), when other defendants have gone bankrupt \n     or fled.\n       The Administration recommends that the Senate adopt the \n     following measures, which are not included in S. 240:\n       Private Aiding-and Abetting--The Committee bill explicitly \n     retains the SEC's authority to take action against those who \n     knowingly aid and abet securities fraud. Congress should also \n     restore this action for the SEC against reckless aiders and \n     abetters, as well as for private actions that follow a \n     successful SEC action.\n       Status of Limitations--The Administration recommends \n     extending the statute of limitations for private securities \n     fraud actions to five years after a violation occurs. \n     Although S. 240 as originally introduced addressed this \n     issue, the Committee deleted it from the bill.\n       It should be noted that the Securities and Exchange \n     Commission has expressed many of the same concerns with \n     respect to this legislation. The Administration encourages \n     the Senate to continue to work with the Securities and \n     Exchange Commission to ensure that S. 240 redresses \n     litigation abuses while preserving the ability of investors \n     to bring class-action lawsuits against financial fraud, a \n     legal device that is critical to the maintenance and \n     integrity of our financial markets.\n       Pay-As-You-Go Scoring.\n       S. 240 could affect receipts; therefore, it is subject to \n     the pay-as-you-go (PAYGO) requirement of the Omnibus Budget \n     Reconciliation Act of 1990. The preliminary OMB PAYGO \n     estimate is zero. Final scoring of this legislation may \n     deviate from this estimate.\n\n                               United States Court of Appeals,\n\n                               Philadelphia, PA, October 31, 1995.\n     Ms. Laura Unger,\n     Mr. Robert Giuffra,\n     Senate Committee on Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs, \n         Dirksen Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Laura and Bob: I have a few suggstions for your \n     consideration on the Rule 11 issue.\n       Page 24, line 11: Insert ``complaint'' before ``responsive \n     pleading.''\n       Page 24, line 19: Insert ``substantial'' before \n     ``failure.''\n       ``Complaint'' would be added to item (i), so there is a \n     clear provision that reaches any failure of the complaint to \n     comply with Rule 11. A small offense would be met by \n     mandatory attorney fees and expenses caused by the offense; \n     if item (ii) is modified without this change, a gap is left \n     in the statutory scheme. The result still is a big change \n     from present Rule 11, which restricts an award of attorney \n     fees to a sanction ``imposed on motion and warranted for \n     effective deterrence.'' A serious offense--filing an \n     unfounded action--would be reached under item (ii).\n       I also wish to confirm our prior conversation on scienter \n     and the pleading requirement.\n       Page 31, line 5: Delete ``set forth all information and \n     insert in its place ``state with particularity.''\n       Page 31, line 12: Delete ``Specifically allege'' and insert \n     in its place ``state with particularity.''\n       As I indicated, this would conform with the existing \n     language in Rule 9(b) which provides that ``the circumstances \n     constituting fraud or mistake shall be stated with \n     particularity.''\n       Also, page 24, line 1: Delete ``entering'' and substitute \n     ``making.''\n       Page 24, line 4: Delete ``of its finding.''\n       Many thanks.\n           Sincerely,\n                                               Anthony J. Scirica.\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, this is an important bill. It is true \nreform. Having read and studied securities litigation, under the \nsecurities law true fraud can be prosecuted, true fraud can be brought.\n  This bill is not going to interfere with those cases. What it does is \nstop the abuse and misuse of the class action litigation and even \nthings out. This will stop the abuse of companies \n\n[[Page S19055]]\nthat have a downturn in their stocks, which happens to a lot of \ncompanies, and perhaps through no fault of their own or through some \neconomic downturn that affects them, and will stop the litigation that \nis brought in many cases just to get defense costs. Too often, it costs \nmore for companies to defend themselves, even though the case is \nmeritless, than it would just to settle the case and get rid of the \nnasty hornet that has been buzzing around the company's head, for the \nuse of these sometimes very greedy lawyers.\n  Not all lawyers are greedy; not all lawyers are bad. Most of them are \nvery good people. But there are abuses in the law. In this area it is \nparticularly pronounced. This bill is brought to try and correct some \nof those pronounced abuses.\n  Mr. BRYAN. Mr. President, I am looking around the gallery today, as \ncitizens visit our Nation's Capitol, and those that are tuned in on \ntelevision across the country are saying to themselves, ``I do not \nunderstand what this debate is all about. Are there not bigger problems \nthat the Nation faces?\"\n  Clearly, we are in a state of paralysis here in Washington today. \nPart of the Federal Government is shut down. There is no clear path, as \nI speak at near 2 o'clock in the afternoon, eastern standard time, as \nto how we are going to break this gridlock or logjam that has gripped \nus in this confrontation as to how we balance the budget in 7 years, \nand the road we use to get it. That is a major issue. No question about \nthat.\n  Let me try to put this debate into some context because I acknowledge \nthat the country's attention is focused on the macroeconomic picture, \nthe kind of thing that will affect the future of our country and of our \nNation.\n  What is at stake here? Is this an argument between a handful of \ngreedy lawyers, as the proponents of this legislation argue, in \ndisagreement with a small group of people on Wall Street--brokers, \naccountants, entrepreneurs--who wish to access the capital markets of \nour country and issue stock? Is that what this thing is all about? I \nsay to our visitors and Americans across the country, this is a far, \nfar bigger issue.\n  I acknowledge that it is terribly esoteric, arcane, highly technical. \nWhy should somebody listening in on this debate have an interest or \nconcern in the outcome? Anyone who has a single share of stock in any \npublicly traded corporation has an interest in the outcome of this \nlegislation because that individual, he or she, could become a victim \nof a fraudulent action. The ability of that individual to recover as a \nconsequence of that fraud is, in my judgment and those of us who have \nfought this legislation, severely limited and compromised. That is tens \nof millions of people. In addition, there are probably tens of millions \nof people more who do not own a direct interest and say, ``Look, I have \nnever invested in the stock market. I have no money. My wife and I and \nmy family are lucky if we have a few dollars in the local credit union \nor the bank. I don't deal with these Wall Street issues. What do I have \nat stake in this debate? You lawyer types and Senators have sure lost \nme in this debate. I do not understand what I have involved.''\n\n  The answer, that there are tens of millions of people out there in \nthis country, good people who have worked all of their lives, who have \nretirement funds--their security, their safety blanket--these people \nhave tens and tens of millions of shares invested across America in \nretirement funds. Those retirement funds could be victimized by \nfraudulent actions, and as a consequence of that fraud, those \nretirement funds can be severely impaired financially, devastated, and \ndepending upon the magnitude of the fraud could, conceivably, be wiped \nout.\n  What does the average American have that interests him in this piece \nof legislation? His or her retirement could be at risk if they are not \nable to adequately recover against those malefactors, those that have \nbeen involved in perpetrating a fraud. So those who have money in a \nretirement out there, whether a company-sponsored family or one of the \nmany variations of a 401(k), you have an interest in this debate and \nyour children have an interest in this debate, because some of you are \nhoping that you have a little money put away, and maybe their \ninheritance can be affected, as well.\n  Broadly stated, 260 million Americans have an interest in the outcome \nof this debate because we are all taxpayers, every single one of us, \ndirectly or indirectly. That is why such widely divergent groups such \nas State financial officials, State treasurers, State controllers, \nState financial officers--Democrat and Republican, East and West, big \ncities and small towns--have expressed their opposition and concern; \nbecause they know that their community, their village, their town, \ninvesting money on behalf of the taxpayers in a securities portfolio, \nthat they can be victimized as well. They do not want to jeopardize \ntheir ability to recover on behalf of the taxpayers of their town or \ntheir community or village. That is why they have joined in opposition.\n  I do not doubt relatively few if any are lawyers or stockbrokers or \ninvolved as entrepreneurs. So it is their interest on behalf of each of \nus as American citizens that has dictated that they write us to inform \nus they are gravely concerned and strongly oppose this bill. I will go \ninto some of the reasons in a moment.\n  University and college officials who are involved in the management \nof investment portfolios of American colleges and universities--whether \nthey be private universities, private colleges, or the great State-\nsupported institutions in our country--they, too, have called and \nwritten. They strongly oppose this legislation because they know that \nthe investment portfolio upon which their college or university depends \ncan be impaired and financially wiped out if investor fraud occurs and \nthey are unable to recover on behalf of those funds the losses \nsustained as a result of that fraud.\n  So we are here today, not talking about 90 greedy lawyers or the \nentrepreneurs. I think all of us in this country, irrespective of our \npolitical leaning or philosophical inclination, are highly supportive \nof the entrepreneurs in America. They do provide the mainstream for our \nfree enterprise system. But this issue is much broader than that \ndebate. Every citizen in America has an interest in the outcome of what \nwe do.\n  It has been said that only the dead have seen the last of war. \nTragically, I suspect that is true, as much as we would hope that is \nnot the case. Let me just say that only the dead have seen the last of \ninvestor fraud in America. The Wall Street Journal, in a fairly recent \npublication, has told us that investor fraud has increased. In another \narticle we are told that, notwithstanding the efforts of the Securities \nand Exchange Commission--no partisan commentary is intended--that \nindeed they have fallen behind. Maybe to some extent we are losing that \nfight, in terms of pursuing with the kind of diligence that every \nAmerican would want us to pursue those individuals who practice fraud \nin the securities markets and who rip us off. So why are we here \ntalking about this thing less than a week before Christmas? It is \nbecause every American is affected.\n\n  Let me try to say a few words about our system, the system we have \ncreated, Democrats and Republicans alike, over a period of some six \ndecades and a little more now, to protect investors, to protect them \nagainst fraud. To those people out there who are motivated by greed, \nwho cut corners a little tightly and whose primary interest is to line \ntheir own pockets and who care not a whit about whom they hurt--there \nare still those people out there in America. Unfortunately, they are \nstill involved in investor securities activities.\n  We set up, over the years, a system that depends upon three pillars \nto protect the consumer, the investor, the American taxpayer in this \nbroad sense. One, we have empowered the Securities and Exchange \nCommission. It is a Federal agency. They are out there monitoring the \nmarket, responding to complaints. That has been true under Republican \nand Democratic administrations alike. The agency traces its origin back \ninto the aftermath of the collapse in the Great Depression in the \n1930's. And they are out there. By and large they do a good job. Sure, \nsome of us may have some criticism of this or that. Criticism can be \nfound with each of us. But they are out there doing a good job.\n  But the system does not depend, in terms of the enforcement and the \npolicing of the markets, solely upon the Securities and Exchange \nCommission. \n\n[[Page S19056]]\n Its premise and predicate contemplates that there are two additional \npillars upon which investor protection is predicated.\n  Another one of those is what we have done at the State level. If I \nmight say for a moment, as my colleagues know, I have had some \nexperience in the State level serving as the chief executive of my \nState. They are banded together in a group called the North American \nAssociation of Securities Administrators. Their job is to try to \nprotect their citizens in each of the 50 States against the kinds of \nfrauds that occur in our society with respect to the issuance of \nsecurities. By and large, I think they do a good job as well. They are \nnot lawyers per se; accountants, per se. They are individuals \nappointed, by and large, by the respective Governors of their States to \nhelp to protect citizens of those States against the kind of securities \nfraud that occurs. So they, too, have written us in the strongest, most \nurgent, compelling language to say in our considered judgment this \nwould limit the ability to protect the citizens of our State. We do not \nspeak as lawyers. We do not speak as accountants. We speak as one who, \nlike yourself, is impressed with the public trust to protect the \ncitizens of our State. That is the way our system works.\n\n  Finally, the system, contemplated and acknowledged by all, that \nnotwithstanding the fact that we have people at the Federal level and \nat the State level who are part of our system of Federal and State \ngovernment who are charged with protecting the consumer, particularly \nas it relates to investor fraud in the securities market--it is \ncontemplated that the private investor, through his or her ability to \nfile class actions in the Federal court system of America, is a very \nimportant adjunct to this system. It is absolutely indispensable; \nabsolutely indispensable. Those statements can be heard from \nRepublicans who have Chaired the Securities and Exchange Commission, by \nDemocrats, and by all commentators, that the private sector is \ncritically important in terms of monitoring the market and in terms of \nrecovering for investors who are defrauded as a result of security \nfraud.\n  In point of fact, that is going to be even more important. Whether \none characterizes himself or herself as liberal or conservative or \nmiddle of the road, everyone in this Chamber, and I think most people \nin America, would acknowledge today that our budgets over the next few \nyears are going to be tighter and tighter and tighter. And that means, \nno matter how much we would like to allocate to certain programs, there \nis going to be less money. So the notion that somehow we are going to \nbe able to provide the Securities and Exchange Commission with more \nmoney to monitor and enforce in the marketplace so that there needs to \nbe less reliance upon the private sector and its ability, through class \nactions, to bring lawsuits, is simply misplaced.\n  Nobody in this Chamber and nobody in the other body believes for one \nmoment that we are going to have those kind of resources, wish as we \nmay. The budgets are going to be tighter next year and the year \nthereafter and the year after that. I say that, Mr. President, as one \nwho recognizes that, who supports the need for that, who is one \nDemocrat who believes that a constitutional amendment to require a \nbalanced budget is a necessary and desirable objective. And I recognize \nthat there are going to be some constraints. So there is going to be \nless money available.\n  This legislation delivers a series of crippling blows to the small \ninvestor to recover through the process of a class action securities \ncase. Having said that, is there no problem out there? Is nothing \nwrong? The answer to both of those questions is yes, there is a problem \nout there, yes, there are some things that need corrections. I \nacknowledge that. The focus ought to be the frivolous lawsuit.\n  I am a lawyer. I am proud to be a lawyer. I was never involved in \nthis type of work at all, have never represented plaintiffs in class \nactions, mercifully have never been sued as part of a class action, and \nhave never defended anybody. But there are lawyers out there who abuse \nthe process, and who abuse the courts, and I have absolutely no \nsympathy at all for those kind of lawyers. As I have said previously on \nthe floor, let Heaven and Earth and the wrath of God Almighty fall upon \nthose lawyers who abuse the system, and there are some.\n  So the focus, it seems to me, ought to be to deal with the frivolous \nlawsuits and to deal with some of the problems that exist in our \npresent regulatory structure. Let me tell you, there are some things \nthat we can agree upon and that I think are good in this legislation, \nthings that I have agreed to support, and indeed things that I have \nsponsored in other pieces of legislation and which my distinguished \ncolleague from California, who spoke so eloquently a moment ago, would \nagree on. So there is some consensus. Let me talk about those for a \nmoment because I am not opposed to legislation to correct the problems \nin the market. I support that enthusiastically.\n  There has been a practice that has grown up that ought to be \neliminated. That is the payment of referral fees to brokers. We ought \nnot to give incentives to brokers to refer potential security fraud to \nclass action lawyers.\n  So this legislation, my friends, prohibits the payment of referral \nfees to brokers. That is a good and desirable reform. I am for that. \nThere has been a practice that has grown up that sometimes in class \nactions certainly plaintiffs' lawyers are given bonus payments. That, \ntoo, is a practice which is wrong, and we ought to eliminate the so-\ncalled ``bounty'' payments or bonuses.\n\n  This legislation limits the class representative's recovery to his or \nto her pro rata share of the settlement for final judgment, no bonus \npayments, and I agree with that. That has been an abuse that we need to \ncorrect. And there are occasions in which lawyers are involved in a \nconflict of interest. This Senator has no sympathy for those lawyers, \nand we ought to eliminate that practice very wisely, and correctly. \nThis legislation does so. I agree and wholeheartedly support that \nprovision.\n  We need to make sure that, before any settlement is effected, that \nthe person for whose benefit the lawsuit was commenced in the first \ninstance--that is, the investors themselves in the class who have lost \nmoney--ought to be adequately informed as to the proposed settlement \nand what it means for them. That is reasonable, is proper, and we ought \nto make sure that is done.\n  This legislation improves the information requirements to make sure \nthat meaningful information about the terms of the proposed settlement \nare included, that it would also include the average amount of damages \nper share that would be recoverable--and the settlement parties can \nagree on the proposed figure--and it also must explain the attorney \nfees and costs.\n  Let me emphasize that point again. The lawyers have to be up front, \nand their clients ought to know what they are getting out of any \nrecovery. I agree and support that as well.\n  Finally, there is the provision which empowers the court to monitor \nand to limit attorney fees to make sure that no small investor is \ngouged as a consequence of lawyer fees. We agree with this. Let me go a \nlittle bit further.\n  I have sponsored a piece of legislation called the Frivolous Lawsuit \nPrevention Act in which I believe that the provisions of rule 11--that \nis one of the Rules of Civil Procedure--which, in effect, requires a \nlawyer who files a lawsuit to, in effect, show that it is a meritorious \nlawsuit, not that the lawsuit will in fact be won. There are few \ncertainties in life, and certainly filing lawsuits and being certain \nthat you are going to win is not one of them. I tried a number of \nlawsuits in my time, not in this field. I have won cases that I thought \nI had very little chance of winning, and I have lost cases that I \nthought were about as certain as could be possible.\n  So the standard is not whether you are going to win, but is it \nmeritorious? There are some lawyers who file frivolous lawsuits. My \nfriends who support this legislation and I would agree, as I have said \npreviously, about strong sanctions. I favor enhanced sanctions through \nthe rule 11 mechanism that would require a judge who finds that there \nhas been frivolous conduct on the part of an attorney to impose \nsanctions, costs and fees. But let me say that not only plaintiffs' \nlawyers abuse the process in the system. Defense lawyers do as well. \nThose sanctions in the provisions that attach ought to apply equally to \nboth sides. \n\n[[Page S19057]]\n\n\n  It is some indication of the bias of this legislation that the \nsanctions that we provide for, the enhanced sanctions, essentially \napply in a very disparate way only with respect to the lawyers who \nrepresent the plaintiffs. Those lawyers should in fact be subject to \nthe sanctions. But their counterparts who are involved in defending \nactions, if there are frivolous actions undertaken by the defendants' \nlawyers, those lawyers ought to be subject to similar sanctions. There \nis an old expression, ``What is sauce for the goose is sauce for the \ngander.'' I do not think you have to be a Harvard law graduate to \nunderstand the fairness and the soundness of that policy. \nUnfortunately, this legislation does not do that.\n  What has happened as this legislation has been developed is something \nthat is characteristic of what has happened in this Congress. Most of \nthe legislation that has been introduced--not all, but most of it--is \ndesigned to deal with the problem in which in a very broad and generic \nsense there is some legitimacy. Yes, there is a problem there that \nrequires action. But if this Congress is noted for anything, it is \nnoted for its propensity to overreach. Yes, there is a problem. But \nrather than just addressing the problem, what occurs is that the gates \nare opened up, and those folks who, again, are motivated by greed see \nan opportunity to make them immune from liability, fail to address the \nstatute of limitations which has nothing to do with the merits of the \nlawsuit, but just when can an injured or defrauded party be able to \nfile the lawsuit under the law. And this is a classic case of \noverreaching, and it is, in my view, an extravagance.\n  It is also, it seems to me, litigation that takes flight and lift \nonly because of some of the myths that are repeatedly mentioned in this \nChamber. Myth No. 1, securities class action suits are exploding in \nnumber.\n  Mr. President, as I indicated earlier in my comments, this \nlegislation derives much of its support from anecdotal evidence, \ninformation, and from what I call a number of myths that have \ncirculated through the Chamber and around the country that have taken \non a life of their own and have assumed the stature of uncontradicted \nfact. I want to take some of these myths for a moment and discuss them.\n  We are told that we need this legislation with all of the \noverbreadth, in my view, that is contained in it because there is a \nsecurities class action lawsuit explosion crisis in America, that the \ncourts are literally being overwhelmed by these actions that have been \nfiled, and, therefore, the Congress must take action to address that \nsituation.\n  I want my comments to be placed in the context in which I earlier \ncommented. I recognize the need, and do in fact agree with reforms \naddressed to the frivolous lawsuit. But here are the facts with respect \nto the assertions that there is a security class action lawsuit \nexplosion crisis that is overwhelming and inundating our court system \nand that we must urgently address.\n  The Administrative Office of the United States Courts--that is the \norganization that keeps the statistical records, what is happening in \nthe court system. No one has suggested that it has any bias on behalf \nof plaintiffs' lawyers or investor fraud plaintiffs nor with respect to \ndefense lawyers or securities folks. This is an outfit that collects \nthe data. Here is what they have to say.\n  According to the Administrative Office of the United States Courts \nthere were 305 securities class action lawsuits filed nationwide 2 \ndecades ago in 1974. That would be 21 years ago. There were some 305 \nsecurity class actions filed. And slightly less--let me emphasize \nthat--slightly less than that, some 290, in 1994. So rather than the \nclass action explosion argument, in point of fact there is \napproximately a 5 percent decrease.\n  This is at the same time in which the country has grown \nsubstantially. There are nearly 260 million people in this country. So \nour population has grown by millions and millions of people, and yet \nthe number of lawsuits in this area have declined.\n  They go on to say,\n  ``These numbers count multiple filings in the same case before the \nactions are consolidated. So the actual number of new cases is far \nless. Over the last several years on average suits have been filed \nagainst approximately 120 companies annually''--about 120 companies \nannually--``out of more than 14,000 public corporations reporting to \nthe Securities and Exchange Commission. Out of the total of 235,000 new \nFederal court civil filings,''--a civil filing is as opposed to a \ncriminal proceeding--under this total of 235,000 new civil court \nfilings, in fact even using the preconsolidation figure of 290 cases, \n``security class actions represent 0.12 of a percent of the new Federal \ncivil cases filed in 1994.''\n  Those are the facts. I know that sometimes my colleagues who are so \nmuch more eloquent than I, sort of from these lofty heights make it \nappear that we have had a litigation avalanche. But the facts are that \nthere are in fact fewer cases filed today in this area than there were \nin 1974, and that approximately 120 companies annually, out of more \nthan 14,000, are subjected to these filings, which represents about .12 \nof the new Federal civil cases filed in 1994.\n  I do not, by making that observation, suggest that all 120 may be \nmeritorious. There may be indeed some frivolous lawsuits that indeed \nthe reforms that I and I think all of our colleagues can agree upon--\nthere are some things we can do and we ought to do in that area.\n  Let me just share a little insight. The Rand Corp. indicates that \nbusiness-to-business contract disputes, that is one business filing a \nlawsuit against another business, constitutes by far the largest single \ncategory of lawsuits filed in Federal court.\n  Although corporate executives claim that minuscule numbers by \nindividual victims cause them to lose time, divert resources and lessen \ntheir ability to compete, I think it is fair to question why 120 suits \nnationwide are taking such a toll, while thousands upon thousands of \nsuits brought by one business against another business presumably has \nno impact whatsoever.\n  As The Wall Street Journal has noted:\n\n       Businesses may be their own worst enemies when it comes to \n     the so-called litigation explosion.\n\n  I think the Rand Corp.'s observation is of some insight here because \nthis legislation before us, this conference report, does absolutely \nnothing with respect to business suits filed against other businesses. \nIts scope is designed to limit private lawsuits brought as class \nactions to recover for investors who have lost money as a result of a \nsecurities fraud.\n  Here is another myth. We hear this, it is repeated, and the volume is \noverpowering: Securities class action suits are hurting capital \nformation, we are told, and that is a legitimate question. If it is \nhurting capital formation, we need to examine to see if it is true and, \nif it is true, what corrective action might be appropriate for us to \nconsider.\n  But here are the facts, Mr. President. The volume of initial public \nstock offerings has risen exponentially over the past several years, \nand the number and size of public securities offerings has been at an \nall-time high. The number of initial public securities offerings over \nthe past 20 years has risen by 9,000 percent.\n  That is the volume of the offerings, setting aside for a moment the \namount of the capital that is sought to be raised through those \nofferings. So we have had an increase of 9,000 percent. Let me say, I \nthink that is good for America, that is good for job creation, that is \ngood for the economy, and I am pleased to see that.\n  The proceeds raised during that period of time from 1974 to 1993 \nincreased by 58,000 percent from $98 million in 1974 to $57 billion in \n1993. So in slightly less than 20 years, or approximately 20 years, the \namount of capital raised through these offerings has increased from $98 \nmillion in 1974 to $57 billion in 1993, and during the same period of \ntime, the number of securities class actions filed had actually \ndeclined by 2.3 percent.\n  So, Mr. President, I would say that the notion that somehow capital \nformation has been impeded or restricted or limited simply does not \nbear out, under a careful analysis, for the data that is available, \nand, as I say, I think this is extraordinarily good news for \nentrepreneurial companies and their investors, for jobs, for the \neconomy. \n\n[[Page S19058]]\n\n  I note the distinguished chairman of the Senate Banking Committee has \nrisen to his feet. If he needs to interject, I certainly would be happy \nto accommodate him, because I may be a bit longer.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York is recognized.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, I want to thank my colleague for his \ngraciousness, but as I only have several minutes of remarks, I can \ncertainly wait. I would just as soon listen to my colleague, because I \nwant him to know that even when we differ on subject matters, I find \nmyself always learning when he speaks, particularly when he speaks on \nthe subject of law. I have great respect for the cogent arguments that \nmy colleague and friend presents.\n  I might also say, that yesterday we heard some remarks as it relates \nto how members in this body, in particular, should treat each other. I \ndaresay, that while my colleague and I probably had some very \ndiametrically opposed positions, I hope that in the context of our \ndiscourse today, Mr. President, we understand that might even be \nencouraged and learn from these differences at times. I cannot ever \nrecall an occasion where I have felt better about coming away with a \nslightly different opinion. If you keep your mind open, sometimes--even \nif you arrive at a different position--you learn something. You learn \nthat there is something out there that maybe you have not factored in \nfully and later on if we have kept an open mind and are willing to \nlearn, as this is not a static body and the law is not static, whether \nit is securities reform litigation or some other legislation, we can \ncorrect positions if they have to be corrected.\n  I must say, Senator Bryan has been one of those Senators whose views \nhave been very instructive to this Senator personally, and I thank him \nfor the manner in which he has always conducted himself. It is \nexemplary.\n  I do not ever envy or look forward to the opportunity of debating \nwith the Senator. They are always good debates, but I have to tell you, \nhe is one of the finest debaters, and he is a gentleman, in the truest \nsense, in terms of the great traditions of the Senate of the United \nStates.\n  I just thought during this season as we approach a very special \nholiday season, sometimes it would pay for us to reflect, that even \nthough we have differences of opinion and, indeed, as is the case of \nthe legislation that is before this body today, I look back at our \ndifferences and I think we have been able to maintain our position \nwithout losing a sense of balance.\n  Mr. BRYAN. Mr. President, I am most grateful for the very generous \nand kind remarks. Let me just say by way of response before returning \nto the issue of the day, the Senator from New York, the very able \nchairman of this committee, takes a back seat to no Member in this \ninstitution or in the other body in terms of his tenacity, in terms of \nhis persistence and effective advocacy on behalf of the causes in which \nhe believes.\n  I can recall when the Senator occupied a different chair on this \nfloor, more to the rear of the Chamber, where he was absolutely \ndedicated to a proposition which affected the citizens of his State and \nspoke, I do not recall whether it was 10, 11 or 12 hours. This is the \nkind of advocate that you get.\n  So I have learned from experience that he is always civil in \ndisagreement, he has always been courteous and very fair to me, and we \nhave worked together on a lot of issues. I acknowledge and appreciate \nthat. I would rather have him on my side, because when he is with you, \nthings not only happen on that committee but on the floor of the \nSenate. I appreciate his advocacy.\n  Again, I pledge to him we are going to continue the discussion we \nhave on this measure and any other on which we might find ourselves \nhonestly and sincerely having a difference of opinion in the same \nspirit in which our relationship has always been, and I thank him for \nthe very generous comments.\n  We were talking about the underpinning of this legislation and what \nhas been said as an arguable predicate for its enactment, and I shared \na couple of myths. I think it would be helpful if I mentioned two or \nthree more and then comment on a couple of things before yielding the \nfloor to the distinguished chairman.\n  It has been asserted in defense of the legislation that is before us \nthat security suits are filed without reason. Every time a stock price \ngoes down 10 percent or more, there is a lawsuit. We have heard the \nstrike lawyers are out there kind of prowling, and any time there is a \ndip in the stock price, bam, they are out there and they have these \nsuits. That may occur on occasion.\n  I am not here to say there is no abuse. I reemphasize somewhat ad \nnauseam that when there is abuse, we need to change the law to make \nsure that kind of conduct is punished in a way which is most understood \nand that is a financial sanction.\n  But here is the data, here are the facts, not the anecdotal \ninformation, not the story that someone heard about someone who had \nbeen sued in a securities suit. Here are the facts.\n  The empirical data established that over 95 percent of the companies \nwhose stock falls more than 15 percent in one day are not sued. These \nrecent detailed studies document the falsity of the argument of the \nproponents of the legislation. A comparison of the number of stock \nprice drops 10 percent or more in one day between 1986 and 1992, and a \nnumber of suits filed against those companies whose stock price dropped \nrevealed that only 2.8 percent of those companies were sued.\n  A second study by the University of California at Berkeley, completed \nin August of last year, 1994, tested a sample of 589 cases of large \nstock price declines following a quarters earnings announcement. \nExtensive research revealed that only 20 lawsuits, amounting to about \n3.4 percent of the sample, were filed. This finding is hardly \nconsistent with the widespread belief that shareholder litigations are \nautomatically triggered by large stock price declines.\n  The study was consistent with yet a third study conducted by \nacademics at the University of Chicago in March of 1993. That study \nrevealed that out of 51 companies that had sustained 20 percent or \ngreater declines in earnings and sales, only one company of those 51 \nwas the target of a shareholders' suit. Again, one of these myths that \nhave assumed lifelike reality that is being asserted is that the suits \nare filed every time a stock price goes down. That simply is not borne \nout by the evidence.\n  Let me address just a couple more of these myths. Another one is that \nsecurities class action suits do not help investors, and private \nlitigation is, in fact, the only way for individual citizens to collect \ndamages from those who commit fraud. For most small investors, who do \nnot have the resources to file their own lawsuit, class action \nrepresentation is the only hope they have of collecting damages from \nwrongdoers. The Securities and Exchange Commission may prosecute some \nsecurities frauds, but it does not have, as I indicated earlier, the \nresources to help all victims of fraud recover their losses. That is \nthe province and responsibility of private legal actions, which the \nSecurities and Exchange Commission has repeatedly termed a ``necessary \nsupplement'' to its activities.\n  Finally, let me just say the other myth that we hear a good bit is \nthat plaintiff lawyers get all the money in these suits, and victims \nare left with pennies. The average attorney's fee and expense award is \n15.2 percent of recovery, according to the authoritative Journal of \nClass Action Reports. The Journal based its findings on a most \ncomprehensive independent study of attorney's fees in class action \nlawsuits involving 334 securities class actions, in which $4.2 billion \nwas recovered for victims of fraud. The same journal reported in 1993 \nthat, on average, for every dollar recovered in securities class \nactions, approximately 83 cents has been distributed to shareholders, \nand only 17 cents has gone to attorneys, including their expenses.\n  Let me just say that I have heard the argument here from a number of \nmy distinguished and very able colleagues that we have to do something, \nthat innocent investors get only a small pittance of the amount \nrecovered in these class actions. Let us assume, for the sake of \nargument, that were true--assuming but not conceding. Mr. President, \nnot one single thing in this legislation would alter that--nothing. \nThere is nothing in this legislation that would provide any type of \nchange in our present system that would increase the amount of money \nthat \n\n[[Page S19059]]\nwould be allocated in a recovery between plaintiffs' attorneys' fees \nand the amount of money that the individual plaintiff recovers.\n\n  Now, it is argued that this legislation is being introduced on behalf \nof the small investor, that we are really doing this, the proponents \nassert, because the small investor needs protection out there; that we \nhave all of these ravenous lawyers here taking advantage of the system \nand taking advantage of the small investors, and that we really strike \na blow for truth, justice, and the American way, and small investors if \nwe support this legislation.\n  Regardless of how little or how much you may know about this area of \nlaw--and I am frank to disclaim any expertise other than what I have \ngleaned from my review of this legislation as it has been processed--I \nthink it is fair to say, who would best represent small investors in \nprotecting their interests? Let us set aside the lawyers for a moment \nbecause, hey, look, clearly they make money as a result of these \nlawsuits. There is no question about that. Let us set aside the \naccountants, let us set aside the brokerage folks, let us set aside the \ncompanies that are issuing stock. I think it can be conceded that each \nof those groups across the philosophical divide have a vested interest. \nNo question about it. So let us look to other groups that are not \nlawyer-based or involved in securities industry work, or its allied \nfields, and let us see what those folks say about this legislation as \nit has been processed.\n  I think it is fair to conclude that this legislation is proposed by \nevery major consumer group--every one of them, including the Consumer \nFederation of America; all major senior citizens groups, including the \nAARP; all major State and local organizations responsible for investing \ntaxpayer pension funds; the Conference of Mayors; the League of Cities; \nthe Association of Counties; Government and Finance Officers; Law \nEnforcement Officials; the North American Securities Administrators \nAssociation; a good many State attorneys general; the Fraternal Order \nof Police; educational institutions, and others, all have opposed it.\n  Now, any one of those groups may not be your cup of tea. You may have \nsome reason, philosophically to disagree with positions they have taken \non other matters of public policy, or other legislation before this \nCongress. But I think it taxes credibility beyond the point of being \nsustained to conclude that each and every one of these groups oppose \nthis legislation, even in the conference form, unless they were \nasserting that in their own judgment, representing the organizational \ninterests that they do, that they honestly and sincerely believe that \nthis is not in the best interest of the small investor. These are the \nfolks, unless we assert that there is some monstrous conspiracy \norganized by these ravenous plaintiff lawyers that has corrupted these \norganizations, ranging from the Consumer Federation to the Conference \nof Mayors, to the League of Cities, to the Association of Counties, to \nthe Fraternal Order of Police--let me say, even those that are enamored \nwith the Oliver Stone approach to life and film, I suspect, have some \ndifficulty believing that--unless one subscribes to the conspiracy \ntheories in history--there is a conspiracy of this magnitude involved. \nI respectfully submit, Mr. President, that these organizations express \ntheir opposition because they believe it is not in the best interests \nof consumers.\n  The North American Securities Administrators Association is not a \npartisan group. There are 50 States--parenthetically, a majority of \nthose States, I think, or a fair majority, are now States that have \nRepublican Governors. So I offer this context so that it not be \nasserted that there is any partisan bias that may be reflected by this \nstatement.\n  Here is a letter sent by way of fax yesterday, December 20. I think \nit is worth sharing because, you will recall, I mentioned that in terms \nof the enforcement mechanisms that are provided to police for \nmonitoring the securities markets in America--public protection, \ninvestor protection, if you will, are predicated upon three pillars: \nThe Securities and Exchange Commission at the Federal level, the \nprivate class action investor lawsuit which we have talked about in our \ndiscussion this afternoon, and finally, at the State level, the North \nAmerican Securities Administrators Association, which I would daresay, \nwithout having reviewed the legislative structure of each of the \nStates, is subject to appointment through the executive branch of \nGovernment, either the Governor's office or the Attorney's General \nOffice.\n  Here is what that group has to say, representing the States. I think \na State perspective, and rightly so, have taken on an enhanced \nappreciation in this Congress. I commend my colleagues on the other \nside of the aisle for focusing much attention in terms of what is \noccurring at the State level. I think we can gain considerable insight.\n  Here is what their correspondence of yesterday said with respect to \nthis legislation:\n\n       Dear Senator: I am writing today on behalf of the North \n     American Securities Administrator's Association to urge you \n     to sustain President Clinton's veto of H.R. 1058, the \n     Securities Litigation Reform Act. In the U.S., NASAA is the \n     national organization of the 50 State securities agencies.\n       While everyone agrees on the need for constructive \n     improvement in the Federal securities litigation process, the \n     reality is that the major provisions of H.R. 1058 go well \n     beyond curbing frivolous lawsuits and will work to shield \n     some of the most egregious wrongdoers from legitimate \n     lawsuits brought by defrauded investors. NASAA supports \n     reform measures that achieve a balance between protecting the \n     rights of defrauded investors and providing relief to honest \n     companies and professionals who may unfairly find themselves \n     the target of frivolous lawsuits.\n       Unfortunately, H.R. 1058 does not achieve this balance. \n     NASAA is concerned with H.R. 1058 go beyond the concerns \n     articulated by President Clinton in his veto message. In sum, \n     NASAA has the following concerns with 1058.\n\n  Mr. President, I will give these abbreviated treatment. The bill \nfails to incorporate a meaningful statute of limitations. I will say \nmore about that later during the course of our discussion this \nafternoon and this evening. I assure my patient colleague that I will \nwind these comments up so he may have a chance to express his views.\n  The bill's safe harbor lowers the standard for assuring truthfulness \nof predictive statements about future performance. My colleagues will \nrecall it was not until 1974 that future or predictive statements were \neven permitted, because of the inherent risk and the temptation of \nthose who were involved in selling and marketing, to overstate \npropositions to the decided disadvantage of prospective purchasers of \nsecurities.\n  No. 3, the bill fails to include aiding and abetting liability for \nthose who participate in fraudulent activity, and a provision of the \nbill's proportionate liability section is unworkable and disfavors \nolder Americans.\n  Mr. President, I am very interested, and I am sure that those who \nsupport the bill will be addressing themselves on this, but I do not \nknow, how do we impeach the integrity of their comment? These are 50 \nsecurities administrators who tell us that in their judgment small \ninvestors are losing a great deal in terms of protection by this \nlegislation, while acknowledging, as do I, that we need some balance. \nThat, clearly, frivolous lawsuits ought not to be tolerated. Some of \nthat is occurring. We ought to come down with a heavy hammer, in my \nview, to preclude that activity. I think it is instructive to listen to \nwhat that group had to say.\n  Let me be parochial for a moment and then I will leave the floor to \nmy good friend. The State of Nevada, for whatever it is worth, a \nplurality of registered voters in my State are Republican. I offer that \nin the context of what I am about to say in terms of the kinds of \nletters that we are getting and the position taken.\n  Churchill County, a small rural county in our State, expresses their \nopposition to this legislation; the city of Boulder City; the city of \nCarlin, through the mayor; the city of Las Vegas, expressing its \nopposition to the Treasurer; the city of Lovelock, another small \ncommunity; the city of Mesquite, our newest incorporated city, through \nthe mayor; the city of Reno; The city of West Wendover; Clark County, \nthe largest county in our State, the county treasurer expresses his \nstrong opposition; the Clark County school district; the Douglas County \nBoard of Commissioners; the Elko County Board of Commissioners; the \nEureka County Board of County Commissioners; the Nevada League of \n\n[[Page S19060]]\nCities; Nevada Public Agency Insurance Board; the Pershing County Board \nof Commissioners; the Reno Sparks Convention Visitors Authority; the \nNevada Attorney General; the State of Nevada Employees Association in \nWashoe County school district, White Plain County, to name just a few.\n  I find it incomprehensible to believe that all of these folks are \nsimply tools of class action plaintiff lawyers. I just do not think \nthat a fair analysis--just using our own intuitive judgments, why would \nall of those folks in our State, as many other States, have expressed \nthose concerns? They have expressed those concerns, Mr. President, \nbecause cities and school boards rely upon the securities market. They \nhave investor portfolios. They are potential victims of fraud.\n  The Orange County situation is one that each of us is familiar with. \nThey want to be sure on behalf of the local county or city or school \ndistrict, whatever the entity might be, that if indeed they are \nvictimized by fraud, they can be covered on behalf of the constituents \nwhose money ultimately is what is at risk. That is why I have asserted \nevery American has an interest in the outcome of this legislation.\n  I yield the floor and I thank the chairman for his great courtesy in \nallowing me to proceed at some length when I know he has been waiting a \nwhile.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for the purposes \nof bringing the Senate up to date, that I may be permitted to proceed \nfor no longer than 5 minutes in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Smith). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/12/21/senate-section/article/S19037-2", "month": "12", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "21", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S19060]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          SUBPOENA ENFORCEMENT\n\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, yesterday, after a full day of debate, \nthe Senate voted to authorize Senate legal counsel to go to court to \nenforce the subpoena of the Whitewater Special Committee for the notes \nof William Kennedy. Mr. Kennedy took these notes at a Whitewater \ndefense meeting at the offices of Williams and Connolly. This meeting \nwas attended by private counsel for the Clintons and four Government \nemployees.\n  I have today asked the Senate legal counsel to begin the process of \nenforcing the subpoena as quickly as possible. The Senate will ask the \ncourt to rule on a Senate enforcement action on an expedited basis so \nthat we can get a determination in the courts as quickly as possible.\n  Now, the Senate legal counsel will file papers with the court on \nWednesday, December 27. There are a number of things he must do prior \nto that. I have been informed he has attempted to contact counsel for \nMr. Kennedy, personal counsel for the President and Mrs. Clinton, and \nthe White House counsel to discuss a schedule in order to obtain a \ncourt ruling as fast as possible. That is so that we can have an \nexpedited proceeding. I hope they will try to arrange for that.\n  As I have said repeatedly, and I want to reiterate, the Senate will \nstop any action to enforce the subpoena as soon as we have Mr. \nKennedy's notes. Until that time, though, we will continue and take all \naction necessary to enforce the subpoena. So there will be no mistake, \nwhile I hope we can get these notes without having to go to court, we \nare not going to wait or delay and then have a situation where \nnegotiations may break down. I understand they are negotiating--that \nis, ``they'' being White House counsel and the President's counsel--\nright now with Members of the House.\n  As I said before, I believe that the Senate and the American people \nhave a right to all of the facts about Whitewater. If these notes help \nus obtain those, certainly, they should be provided. Again, we are \ngoing forward, but I say if we get the notes we will stop the \nproceedings. At this time, though, we are attempting to get an \nexpedited proceeding. It is our intent to be in court on December 27.\n  Mr. President, I thank my colleague for permitting the opportunity \nfor bringing that update.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a moment?\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Certainly.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Is the Senator now going to address the securities \nbill?\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Yes. I asked I might be permitted to proceed in morning \nbusiness for no more than 5 minutes, just for the purposes of that \nupdate. That was the only thing I asked. But I was now going to address \nthe securities reform litigation.\n  Mr. SARBANES. I would like to address the issue the Senator \naddressed. I can defer until he finishes the securities matter?\n  Mr. D'AMATO. No, I yield to my friend, certainly. I think it would be \nappropriate, if he wants to do that, to yield to him now for purposes \nof making his remarks at this time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I appreciate the Senator from New York \nyielding.\n  I think the report that was just brought to the floor underscores \nwhat I thought was the wisdom and the reasonableness of the amendment \nthat was offered yesterday and the suggestion that we ought to try to \nresolve this matter without moving to a confrontation. I listened \ncarefully to my colleague. As I think he said, he intends to be in \ncourt on the 26th----\n  Mr. D'AMATO. The 27th.\n  Mr. SARBANES. That is, I think, where the majority has intended to be \nall along. We have consistently suggested if we would draw back here \nand try to resolve this matter, it could be worked out without a court \ntest.\n  The assertion is made that by going to court, they will speed the \nprocess up. In fact, they will slow it down. That is very clear. Even \nunder expedited procedures, it is going to take a fair amount of time \nto carry this matter through. So, if you want to get a quick resolution \nof it, obviously the way to do it would have been to follow the path \nthat we outlined yesterday with respect to the furnishing of the notes \nand to try to have worked in obtaining from the House an agreement or \nunderstanding with the White House that would make it possible for them \nto do so.\n  They have offered to do it. They have obviously come forward in an \neffort to try to do it.\n  This push to the courtroom, I think, is simply to create, as it were, \na public issue and a confrontation. As I indicated yesterday, I regret \nthat. I continue to regret it. I think it is unnecessary. I think it is \na provoked controversy, largely for political content. I think as these \nother negotiations seem to bear fruit, it only underscores that point.\n  I do think if the matter is carried to court and resolved there, that \nwe may end up with it being clear that a very serious mistake was made \nby the Senate.\n  I thank the Senator for yielding.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, I am not going to speak for more than 30 \nseconds on this whole issue of the subpoena. I just wanted to serve \nnotice and let the administration know that, again, if they \nsuccessfully complete their negotiations with whoever they are \nnegotiating with--the House and whatever Members--that is fine, as long \nas we get the notes. If we do not, if it gets protracted, we will \ncontinue. I have to do that so that the process does not break down. So \nI thought I would at least bring us up to date on that.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/12/21/senate-section/article/S19060-1", "month": "12", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "21", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S19060-S19073]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 SECURITIES LITIGATION REFORM ACT--VETO\n\n  The Senate continued with the reconsideration of the bill.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to remain firm in \ntheir support of this legislation, legislation that, just two weeks \nago, was passed overwhelmingly in the Senate, legislation that was \npassed overwhelmingly in the House, legislation that was clearly, once \nagain, approved by the House, when the President's veto was overturned \nby a huge majority, the vote was 319 to 100.\n  It is here now for us to consider. Let me say, Mr. President, no one \ncan argue that the current system is not broken because it is broken. \nSome of my colleagues raise some objections related to pleadings, the \npleading requirements and some things of a very technical nature--\nwhether or not, for example, the second circuit opinion should be \nincorporated into this law--we are really getting into hair splitting. \n\n[[Page S19061]]\n\n  But I will tell you an area where no one can split hairs, no one can \ndivide. The system as it presently exists is shameful--shameful--\nhorrendous. This system does not protect investors. This is the Full \nEmployment Opportunity Act for a handful of lawyers. They are out there \nmining, prospecting for gold. They do not protect the average citizen. \nThey do not protect the small fry investor.\n  Let me tell you what the leading advocate of this system says, as it \nrelates to the practice of law. He says, and I quote, ``I have the best \npractice in the world.'' Do you know why he says that? It is amazing. \nDoes he say it because he is able to help people? Because he is able to \nbring comfort to them? Because he is able to help widows and orphans \nwho are in need, who have been ripped off? That he has helped? That \nwould be laudable. Does he say that because he is able to go after \nthose who have robbed, who have pilfered, who have cheated? That would \nbe laudable.\n  ``I have the best practice in the world,'' he says. And why? \n``Because I have no clients.''\n  That is a heck of an attitude. And that is what exists. And he is \nworking, working. I wonder how many millions of dollars--millions, he, \nhimself, has pumped into the system to buy ads to scare people, to tell \nthem they are going to take their rights away.\n  What we are looking to do is see to it that investors are protected, \nnot a handful of attorneys, and one in particular, an attorney who \nsays, ``I have the best practice in the world because I have no \nclients.'' His words. Why does he not come to the floor and explain \nthat? Let him come out here and tell us how he can justify that kind of \nsentiment to the Senators who are going to be voting.\n  Does he care about widows? Orphans? Defrauded people? He cares about \nhis pocketbook. He hires a bunch of people to file claims--hires them, \nprofessional plaintiffs we call them. Some of them get as much as \n$25,000, not based upon what the injury was to them.\n  How would you like to be this stockholder? You have 10 shares--that \nis what some of these guys own, 10 shares. They buy shares in every \ncompany. If the stock of the company goes down, they are recruited, the \nsame handful of professional plaintiffs. You see, each one of them buys \na share, a couple of shares in each company. If the share goes down, \nfour or five of them sign up and this lawyer runs into court. He is now \nrepresenting all the shareholders. In most of those cases, his \nshareholders do not own anything worth anything. You cannot even say \none-tenth of 1 percent. So, when he says he represents no clients, he \nmeans that.\n  Now, he is in there representing, supposedly, all of the \nshareholders. Our bill says you cannot have professional plaintiffs \nanymore. You cannot have the same bunch of thieves, because that is \nwhat they are--thieves for hire. And we permit them, today, under the \nlaw. They should be banned, outlawed, they are robber barons.\n  Here is this lawyer who is pumping in hundreds and hundreds of \nthousands to protest this bill. I have not heard anybody talking about \nhim. I have not seen anybody talking about how much money he has \nsiphoned into various groups, money he has funneled to them so they can \nrun their phony ads, how they fund these little groups who say, ``Oh, I \nam for the little guy.''\n  Little guy my foot. This millionaire lawyer is going around funding \neverybody. Why should he not? He makes tens of millions of dollars. \nRemember who his clients are--nobody. He is operating for himself. He \nis an entrepreneur--not my words, his words. ``I have the best practice \nin the world. I have no clients.''\n  It is a disgrace. We should change this system. And that is what this \nbill does. It protects, for the first time, people who own shares. It \nallows the pension fund managers who are managing hundreds of millions \nof dollars to have a say as to who will be selected to lead in the \nrepresentation of investors when there is fraud and exploitation. Has \nthere been exploitation? Absolutely. We have operators like Charles \nKeating, where people unjustly have enriched themselves at the expense \nof shareholders, stockholders, and pensioners. Of course, we must get \nthem and put them in jail.\n  This legislation makes it easier for the Securities and Exchange \nCommission to do exactly that, to bring lawsuits. We created greater \nresponsibility on the part of auditors and accountants for the first \ntime in this bill. But, my gosh, let us not say that we have a system \nthat is a good system when it is out of control, when we permit legal \nlarceny because somebody may have some economic power, so, therefore, \nwe permit someone else to hold them up and say, ``If you have even the \ntiniest bit of negligence, we are going to hold you liable for whatever \nthe loss is even if you were not part of a conspiracy because you could \nhave done better.'' Our laws should not work on that basis. It should \nbe worked on the basis of fairness, what is fair and what is right.\n  It is really long overdue, the need to reform this kind of litigation \nfrom a money-making enterprise for a handful of lawyers--and it is a \nhandful of lawyers--into a better means of recovery for those who have \nlost out. Curtailing abusive securities litigation while allowing \ninvestors to bring meritorious lawsuits will permit investors to have a \nsystem of redress that serves them, not one that entraps them. This \nbill serves investors and not a handful of lawyers who are proud to \nclaim that they have the best practice because they have no clients.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I want to address the securities \nreform veto override. It is my intention to support the override \neffort, and I would like to summarize for the Record my views on the \nlegislation and my reasons for supporting the bill. Because the senior \nSenator from Connecticut is here, I would like to ask him a series of \nquestions, if I might, and see if I am correct in my assumptions, and, \nif I am not, give him the opportunity to clarify my concerns. As you \nknow, the senior Senator is one of the main cosponsors of this bill.\n  The first involves the so-called license to lie challenge to the safe \nharbor. I spent about 6 hours with various representatives of the high-\ntechnology companies and representatives of the SEC on the safe harbor. \nAt the time the SEC would not sign off on language that they wanted and \nincluded in the bill. Subsequently, SEC Chairman Arthur Levitt did sign \noff on the safe harbor legislation, a decision confirmed by letter from \nChairman Levitt, that has already been introduced into the Record.\n  I would like to state my understanding of the safe harbor and see if \nthe senior Senator of Connecticut concurs.\n  To claim the protection of the safe harbor, an individual company \nofficer must clearly identify the statement, either written or oral, as \na forward-looking statement. By forward-looking statement, I mean a \nstatement that applies it to economic projections, estimates, or other \nfuture events. The safe harbor cannot be claimed by certain groups of \nindividuals--and I will go into that shortly. This statement must be \naccompanied by meaningful cautionary statements, identifying important \nfactors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the \nforward-looking statement. That is to say, the statement must be \naccompanied by a clear warning that identifies the risk that the future \nmay not turn out as forecast. This warning cannot be routine warning \nlanguage, but must be specific to the forward-looking statement.\n  Is that a correct understanding of this bill?\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I say to my colleague from California that \nshe is absolutely correct. This is exactly what the meaning of that \nsafe harbor language is.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I thank the Senator. If the statement is oral, it is \nmy understanding that the individual must identify the statement as \nforward-looking; clarify that actual results may differ materially; \nand, state at the same time that additional information about the \nforward-looking statement is contained in a readily written available \ndocument with additional information which satisfies the same warning \nstandard required of written standards.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I further say to my colleague from \nCalifornia that is absolutely correct.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Or, as a separate test, as I am led to believe, the \nsafe \n\n[[Page S19062]]\nharbor does not apply if the statement is made with ``actual \nknowledge'' that the statement was ``an untrue statement of a material \nfact or omission of a material fact necessary to make the statement not \nmisleading.''\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, the Senator from California is correct as \nwell on that.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I appreciate the Senator from Connecticut's comments, \nwhich, I believe helps clarify the scope of safe harbor.\n  Let me go on.\n  As I understand it, the protections of the safe harbor are not \navailable to reduce the obligations of companies to disclose historical \ninformation or current information truthfully and accurately. For \ninstance, if a company makes misleading statements about known facts, \nthe safe harbor does not protect the company.\n  Mr. DODD. That is correct, I say to my colleague.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I further understand the safe harbor provisions do \nnot apply to certain companies we may have reason to have some doubt \nabout, such as penny stock companies, initial public offerings known as \nIPO's, blank check companies, roll-up transactions, or companies \nrecently convicted of specific securities law violations. All of these \ntypes of companies are excluded, as I understand it, from the \nprotection of the safe harbor provisions. The provisions are only \navailable to companies with an established track record.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I say to my colleague from California that \nis absolutely correct.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I thank the Senator.\n  As we discuss companies or individuals ineligible for the safe \nharbor, I would also want to clarify the safe harbor does not apply to \nbrokers or analysts who may have an incentive to oversell a stock to \nobtain a sale. On this point, the safe harbor would not have applied to \nthe financial concerns we experienced in Orange County, California. If \nMerrill Lynch is a broker selling derivatives to a county government, \nin my state of California or any other state, they are not protected by \nthe safe harbor because the safe harbor does not protect brokers and \ndoes not address derivatives.\n  Mr. DODD. The Senator from California is correct.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I understand the safe harbor does not apply to a new \ncompany, but only applies to seasoned issuers. For instance, NetScape, \na new high-technology company, which saw its stock explode from zero to \n$120 a share or more, can claim no protection under the safe harbor \nbecause it is an initial public offering.\n  Mr. DODD. That is correct.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Finally, I wish to clarify for the record that the \nsafe harbor does not affect the jurisdiction of the Securities and \nExchange Commission or the SEC's authority to work with the Justice \nDepartment to bring enforcement actions against wrongdoers for fraud, \ninsider trading or any other enforcement action. So, in other words, \nthe safe harbor cannot be used as a defense against the jurisdiction of \nthe Securities and Exchange Commission.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I say to my colleague from California that \nis absolutely correct.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I very much thank the Senator. I would like to go on \nand specifically address the concerns of cities because I have received \nexactly some letters from various cities, 26 or so to be precise, \nindicating their concern. We have taken a good look at it.\n  I think one of the core lessons about Orange County is that cities \nshould not be investing in speculative investments. I know from my \ntenure as mayor of San Francisco for 9 years, and I served on the \ninvestment body which was then the retirement board, these kinds of \nspeculative ventures were prohibited.\n  We have heard some discussion about the financial concerns involving \nOrange County, CA, but as was discussed earlier, these circumstances \nwould not be altered by the safe harbor under the bill. In Orange \nCounty, the treasurer was buying derivatives from Merrill Lynch. \nDerivatives are not protected by the safe harbor. Further, Merrill \nLynch, serving as a broker, is ineligible to claim safe harbor \nprotection. So you have protections built in two different ways. \nDerivatives are not protected, and a broker is not protected.\n  I believe--and my vote is cast on this belief--that the cities' \nconcern appears primarily to address the proportional liability section \nof the bill. Under the proportional liability rules adopted in the \nbill, an accountant from a big accounting company would not risk \nbearing the full cost of a plaintiffs' loss if it audits the books, \ncertifies them and fraud causing loss to plaintiffs subsequently \narises. However, even the proportional liability rule, as I understand \nit, has a significant protection built in.\n  While the bill adopts a proportional liability rule, proportional \nliability will not limit the responsibility of a business or an \nindividual who commits ``knowing securities violations.'' I think that \nis very important. Such an individual would remain responsible to pay, \nnot the proportional loss, but the full loss, as I understand it.\n  I know the senior Senator from Connecticut will correct me if he \nbelieves that is inaccurate.\n  ``Knowing securities fraud'' includes any defendant who had actual \nknowledge, or operated under circumstances in which they should have \nhad knowledge, the fraud occurred.\n  So the provision will not permit accountants who commit knowing \nsecurities fraud to eliminate full liability for accountants who \ndeserve to be fully liable. Would the Senator agree with that?\n  Mr. DODD. The Senator from California is correct, I would say, Mr. \nPresident, with that observation.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I think that is very important to the cities that are \nwatching this debate.\n  Further, special rules are provided to force proportionally liable \ndefendants to pay more if a particular plaintiff suffers a high level \nof losses. A significant part of the debate revolves around our concern \nfor poor and potentially vulnerable plaintiffs. Under this bill, if a \nplaintiff can claim damages exceeding 10 percent of their net worth, \nand their net worth is less than $200,000, then a defendant remains \nfully liable for that loss to the plaintiff and no proportional \nliability can be used to reduce that liability.\n  Additionally, many of us have concerns with the application if this \nlaw in instances involving insolvent defendants. If a defendant cannot \npay due to bankruptcy, the defendants who would otherwise be only \nproportionally liable must pay up to 50 percent more to make up the \nplaintiff's shortfall due to the bankruptcy. What this means is that if \nthe battle comes down to an innocent plaintiff who loses and a \nproportionally liable defendant who feels it would be unfair to force \nthem to bear the full loss, the defendant loses and the proportionally \nliable defendants must pay more.\n  These are very important concepts to me, and I wanted to come to the \nfloor to place my understanding with respect to legislative intent in \nthe Record. I am very pleased that the senior Senator and author of \nthis legislation is present and has corroborated these statements.\n  I thank the Chair. I thank the Senator. I yield the floor.\n  Mrs. BOXER addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I thank you very much.\n  My senior Senator from California and I usually, when it comes to \nissues affecting our State, come down on the same side. We have clearly \ncome down on opposing sides here. Before she leaves the floor, I just \nwanted--I do not ask her to stay because I know she has other pressing \nmatters--to talk about the breadth and the depth of the opposition to \nthis bill and the support for the President coming from local elected \nofficials in our home State where she served, as we know, as an \nesteemed and extraordinary mayor of the city and county of San \nFrancisco. I served on the board of supervisors in neighboring Marin \nCounty for 6 years and its president for a time.\n  I think what is important here is that authors of the bill feel very \nstrongly in their work product, what they do and their intentions. I \nhave never once doubted the intentions of those who have brought this \nto us, that their prime intent was to make sure that frivolous lawsuits \nwere a way of the past. But it is the people who invest in securities \nwho have looked at this from the standpoint of protecting investors, \nand I have never seen such a \n\n[[Page S19063]]\nlist of county officials that I placed in the Record from almost every \nsingle county in California, from the county administrators to the \ntreasurers, to tax collectors. These are the people who know that they \nneed to have protection from those who would seek to take advantage of \ninvestors. This list is extraordinary.\n  The League of California Cities wrote a letter to the President dated \nDecember 5, 1995:\n\n       As representatives of municipal Government who oversee \n     billions of dollars in investments, we strongly urge you to \n     oppose the Securities Litigation Reform Act.\n\n  And they say:\n\n       Any securities litigation reform must achieve a balance \n     between protecting the rights of defrauded investors and \n     protecting honest companies from unwarranted litigation. \n     Abusive practices should be deterred and sternly sanctioned. \n     However, we believe that investors would be penalized and \n     become victims of security fraud and that wrongdoers would be \n     rewarded.\n\n  And they call it ``an anti-investor bill which would impose new and \nblatantly unfair requirements on the victims of fraud, making it very \ndifficult for them to seek redress through the courts.''\n  Now, the number of California governments opposed to this is \nstaggering--not only governments but agencies: The Alameda County \nEmployees' Retirement Association, Amador County Treasurer/tax \ncollector, the treasurer of the AFSCME local in Pasadena, the Calaveras \nCounty Board of Supervisors, California Association of Treasurers and \nTax Collectors, California Association of County Treasurers--we have \nmore than 50 counties in our State--California Council of Senior \nCitizens Clubs of San Diego and Imperial Counties, California County \nAdministrative Officers Association--that is the association of the \nadministrators of counties, over 50; I am just listing a few here--the \nCalifornia Labor Federation, the California Government Finance Officers \nAssociation, the California Municipal Treasurers Association, the \nCalifornia Public Interest Research Group, the California State \nAssociation of Counties, the city of Albany, the city of Arcadia, the \ncity of Barstow, the city of Beverly Hills, the cities of Burbank, \nBurlingame, El Monte, Fairfield, Fremont, Glendale, Hayward, Hemet, \nHuntington Beach, Irvine, Long Beach, Manhattan Beach, Moreno Valley, \nNewport Beach, Oceanside, Ontario, Riverside, the city of San \nBernardino, San Fernando, San Francisco, Mayor Frank Jordan; city and \ncounty of San Francisco board of supervisors, city of San Jose, Mayor \nSusan Hammer; city of Santa Ana, city of Santa Rosa, city of Santee, \ncity of South Pasadena, city of Stockton, city of Thousand Oaks, city \nof Ventura.\n  Why am I doing this? Because I am trying to make it clear that the \nopposition to this legislation is broad and it is deep. I will stop \nmentioning the cities, and I will shift to some of the counties: Del \nNorte County, El Dorado County, Fresno County, Glenn County, Humboldt \nCounty, Imperial County, Inyo County, Kern County, Kings County, Lake \nCounty, Lassen County treasurer/tax collector, Los Angeles County \nEmployees Retirement, Los Angeles County Federation of Retired Union \nMembers, Marin County--that is where I am from--Employees Retirement \nCorporation, Mariposa County, Mendocino County--I am at the M's. It \ngoes on and on: San Diego County treasurer/tax collector, Sacramento \nCounty treasurer/tax collector, San Francisco Democratic County Central \nCommittee, San Joaquin County, San Luis Obispo County, Santa Barbara \nCounty treasurer/tax collector, Senior Meals and Activities, Service \nEmployees International.\n  Then it goes to the T's and the U's and the V's, and it ends with \nYuba County Supervisors, county administrator and the treasurer/tax \ncollector. And the number of editorials has been just extraordinary \nfrom my State.\n  One has to wonder why this has happened, and I think it is because \nthis is a very complicated matter.\n  My friend from California had several problems that she wanted to \nclarify, and she feels comfortable that they have been clarified. But \nwhen you are rewriting securities law, Mr. President, which has \nprotected investors since the 1930's, it is very complicated, and as a \nformer stockbroker I can tell you when people used to call me they \ntrusted me. They trusted me. And the fact of the matter is I would lose \nsleep rather than give someone terrible advice. And that is one of the \nreasons I did not stay in that business. It was very, very difficult, \nbecause I worried every time the stock market went down and an elderly \nretiree called me the next day. I just felt it was an enormous \nresponsibility. student. Unfortunately, in our great country, the \ngreatest on Earth, with the greatest free market system and the \ngreatest, frankly, laws protecting investors, there are people who \nwould take advantage of the elderly and of people who really are not \nsophisticated. And it is easy to do.\n\n  What this bill does, as you look at it and its transformation, \nunfortunately, is give people like the Charles Keating and people who \nreally do not care about other people an opportunity to rip off people \nbecause the legal system will not go after them.\n  The way the bill is written, the pleading requirements are so \ndifficult plaintiffs would have a hard time even getting into court. \nAnd even if they get into court, you have a specter over your head that \nan unfriendly judge could decide, if you are an elderly, small \ninvestor, for example, that your lawsuit did not have merit and you are \ngoing to have to pay the bills of those on the other side. And that has \na very chilling effect.\n  Therefore, when the President vetoed this bill, he said very clearly \nthat he would love to sign a securities reform bill. He wants to sign a \nsecurities reform bill. He wants to make sure that there are fewer \nfrivolous lawsuits. He wants to make sure, in fact, that people in the \nSilicon Valley, my constituents, the senior Senator from California's \nconstituents, are not hit with strike suits. None of us wants that.\n  Unfortunately those with another agenda have prevented that. Instead \nof having a bill that goes after those lawyers that are filing \nfrivolous lawsuits, to quote one of the newspapers, ``Instead, the bill \nstabs the small investor in the back.''\n  That is why we have so many county treasurers and county \nadministrators and boards of supervisors and mayors and the League of \nCalifornia Cities opposed to the bill as it is now written--these \npeople know they want to protect their employees and retirees \ninvestments.\n  Mr. President, as we enter the battle of the budget, and we fight \nhard--in my view, this is what the President is doing--fighting hard to \nprotect the middle class, trying hard so that our elderly will have \nMedicare, and the seniors in nursing homes will have Medicaid when they \nneed it, and we have student loans for our children, and we have the \npolice on the beat for our middle-class and all communities--we cannot \ndivorce this bill from that battle. Who would be hurt the most if we do \nthe wrong thing, which the President thinks we are about to do, here?\n  Many of the experts in this field warn us about this bill. Who will \npay the price if we do the wrong thing? Not the very wealthy because, \nif the very, very wealthy get bilked in one investment, they are still \non their feet. They are OK. They can survive. Not the very, very poor, \nbecause the very, very poor do not have money to invest.\n  This bill is going to be aimed at the solid middle class, those \npeople who saved for their retirement and suddenly find out when they \nare bilked that they have no recourse because the securities laws were \nreformed.\n  Mr. President, there is a difference between reform and repeal. And I \nthink the President has laid that out. He is opposed to the pleading \nrequirements. He is opposed to the safe harbor. Many of us believe is \nnot a safe harbor at all, but a pirate's cove because all you have to \nsay to be immunized is, ``This is an estimate. This is just an estimate \nof future activity.'' Then you can hide behind that language.\n  So I hope that we sustain the President's veto. It was a courageous \nthing for him to veto, in my opinion. It is going to be a very close \nvote one way or another, maybe one, two, or three votes. I just hope we \nwill stand with the President because I think he is fighting for the \nmiddle class in this veto.\n  I yield the floor at this time.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California, Senator \nFeinstein. \n\n[[Page S19064]]\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. If I might briefly respond to my respected colleague.\n  It is interesting, I guess, in a State as big as California one can \nhave some different constituencies. My mail is, oh, maybe over 100 to 1 \nfor the legislation rather than opposed to it. When I read the letters \nfrom the counties, that is when I saw they were functioning under a \nmisimpression of what the safe harbor actually did. That is why, in my \ncolloquy with Senator Dodd, I tried to clarify these concerns. As I \nstated earlier, first, the stockbroker who sold the derivatives to \ncities or counties would not gain the protection of the safe harbor \nbecause brokers are ineligible; and, second, derivatives would not be \nprotected by the safe harbor. So I tried to straighten that part out.\n  I want to point out that in California we are going through an \neconomic change. High technology and biotechnology is a big source of \njobs now and in the future. It is estimated that 62 percent of the \nhigh-technology companies that went public from 1988 to 1993 have faced \nsecurities lawsuits. And 62 percent of the companies that have gone \npublic in the last 5 years have faced securities lawsuits in the State \nof California. That alone indicates that there is a problem that needs \nto be addressed.\n  What has concerned me in the legislation is a desire to address the \nproblem and not throw out the goose that laid the golden egg. I want to \nprotect the small investor, protect the county, and yet do away with \nthe kind of lawsuit that happens because a companies' stock drops, a \nsuit is filed, they press discovery and they move and collect a large \nsettlement from the company, when the suit may be baseless.\n  Those kinds of frivolous suits concern me. I think it is a legitimate \nfunction of government to attempt to reform that. I also think it is \nimportant that this legislation strikes a balance and protects the \nconsumer. Based on what I have seen, I believe it does.\n  More fundamentally, if it is proven to have a flaw or a problem, that \nflaw or problem can in fact be corrected. As I understand, it this \nlegislation has taken some 5 or 6 years now to develop. The bill has \nbeen refined and refined over time. The bill has finally passes both \nHouses, the veto override has been supported in the House of \nRepresentatives. It seems to me it is time to get on with it and give \nthe kind of necessary reform that I believe this bill provides in an \nevenhanded manner. I thank the Chair.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Will my friend yield to me for just a comment? And that \nis, I respect her completely for coming down on the other side. Of \ncourse, there are two sides to every story. I was just pointing out \nthat as a former stockbroker myself and having felt that responsibility \non my shoulders, the people who I really do tend to listen to in these \nmatters are people who do not have a stake in it, and that is the \npeople who are the investors.\n  All they want is a safe securities market. I agree with my friend, we \nmay be back here fixing this bill. I think that the President has given \nus a road map to do that. I do not want to go on except to close, and I \nknow my friend from North Carolina has been so patient.\n  Money magazine has really taken this issue on. And I think they make \na very good point here when they say,\n\n       The President should not sign [the bill]. . . . Here's why: \n     The bill helps executives get away with lying. Essentially, \n     lying executives get two escape hatches. The bill protects \n     them if, say, they simply call their phony earnings forecast \n     a forward-looking statement and add some cautionary \n     boilerplate language.\n\n  And they talk about the fact that legitimate lawsuits would not get \nfiled. So reasonable people come down on different sides. I want \nreform, but I want to see it done in a way that we stop these frivolous \nlawsuits but we still protect the small investors. Thank you very much \nfor your patience, I say to my friend from North Carolina. I yield the \nfloor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Carolina is recognized.\n  Mr. FAIRCLOTH. I rise in strong support of the motion to override the \nPresident's veto of H.R. 1058.\n  Mr. President, securities litigation reform is extremely important to \nthe future of our economy. Obviously, the President disagrees. It is \nunfortunate. The President pretends that he supports our high-\ntechnology industry, but his veto showed that he cares more about trial \nlawyers than the growth of business in this country.\n  The Wall Street Journal may have called it right. They said Bill \nClinton could be the President of torts.\n  Mr. President, the irony of this is that it is not a partisan issue. \nThe lead sponsor of this bill is my friend from Connecticut, who is \nchairman of the Democratic National Committee. Republicans and \nDemocrats alike have recognized the strike suits are very serious \nproblems.\n  Mr. President, America is the undisputed leader in technology. No \nother country comes close to our leadership in this area. But a small \ncadre of lawyers have found a way to make a living by launching these \nstrike suits against companies.\n  This is wrong. It is hurting America, it is hurting our economic \ngrowth, it is slowing our job growth, and it has to stop. It is hurting \nour fastest growing high-technology business. This bill is a good \nstart.\n  Mr. President, these lawsuits that have been filed against these \ncompanies have little to no merit, but they are filed for the purpose \nof blackmailing companies into settling rather than going to court. In \nother words, it is cheaper to buy them off than it is to fight it in \ncourt.\n  The cost of these suits to the American economy is no small matter. \nAt the end of 1993, class action lawsuits were seeking $28 billion in \ndamages--$28 billion--which is a staggering amount, and most of these \nlawsuits are totally worthless.\n  The committee has had example after example of how absurd the cases \ncan be. For example, one individual has filed against 80 companies in \nwhich he held stock and, in most cases, an infinitesimal amount of \nstock. Another individual has filed 38 lawsuits, 14 of them with the \nsame law firm.\n  Another man, a retiree since 1990, 5 years, has filed 92 lawsuits, \none for every year of his age. He is 92.\n  One law firm files a securities suit every 5 working days, one a \nweek. They are just churning them out, whether there is any validity or \nnot. That is how much it takes to meet the payroll, so they churn out \none a week. In many cases, these lawsuits are filed within hours of \nprice stock drops. The National Law Journal reported that of 46 cases \nstudied, 12 were filed within 1 day and another within a week of \npublication of unfavorable news about a company.\n  Anybody that has ever run a company knows that all the news is not \nalways favorable, no matter how hard you work at it. Mr. President, a \npoint to remember in this debate is that investors are not helped by \nthese lawsuits. If the President vetoed this bill for the small \ninvestor, then he missed the point in what the bill was about, and he \nis wrong. He is not protecting the little investor, he is only \nprotecting a cottage industry of trial lawyers who make a living out of \nthese lawsuits, and they have made a very plush living.\n  Study after study shows that lawyers get the lion's share of the \nsettlements. We had testimony that the average investor receives 6 or 7 \ncents for every dollar lost in the market because of these suits, and \nthis is before the lawyers are paid and they get the lion's share of \nit.\n  A couple of weeks ago, Fortune magazine had a picture of two lawyers \nwho said, ``Beware of this type of lawyers, they will destroy your \ncompany.'' That was the cover story. So this is going on and the \nbusiness investment community is aware of it.\n\n  One of the significant parts of the bill allows courts to determine \nwho the lead plaintiff is, one that is most adequate to represent the \nclass, not a person who ran to the courthouse and got there first, and, \nin many cases, the way these suits have been filed, it is simply who \ngot to the courthouse first, not who had the real vested interest.\n  If the President wants to protect investors, this is the bill to do \nit. The lead plaintiff must file a sworn statement that he or she did \nnot buy the securities at the direction of counsel. Too often, many of \nthese plaintiffs are straw men acting on behalf of the lawyers who \ninstructed them to buy the stock in order that they could file the \nsuit, and they make a profession out of filing the suits. \n\n[[Page S19065]]\n\n  This provision will encourage institutional investors to be the lead \nplaintiff, the people who have a real vested interest. After all, they \nhave the most at stake in these lawsuits. Institutional investors have \n$9.5 billion in assets. They account for 51 percent of the equity \nmarket. Further, pension funds $4.5 trillion in assets.\n  These funds--mutual funds and pension funds--represent the holdings \nof millions of Americans, many of them small savers. They have every \nright to have fraudulent lawsuits brought fairly and correctly, not \njust because a certain lawyer jumped in front of him and got to the \ncourthouse first.\n  Mr. President, the conference report will punish lawyers that file \nfrivolous lawsuits. The bill requires a mandatory review by the court \nof whether a lawyer filed frivolous motions and pleadings, known as \nrule 11 under the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. What could be the \nproblem with this provision--enforcing the Rules of Civil Procedure?\n  The veto message was concerned with the pleadings standards, but a \nkey part of this bill is stopping lawsuits that allege no specific \nwrongdoing but just generally allege fraud, just blanket fraud, because \nthe stock price dropped. We have seen some pretty sharp stock price \ndrops lately and not because anybody committed fraud. These kinds of \nsuits get the plaintiff into court and then they can start demanding \nsettlement.\n  The bill requires that an attorney in a private action must allege \nfacts giving rise to a strong inference that the defendant had the \nrequired state of mind to make an untrue statement. At the very least, \nthis provision requires that lawyers have more to go on than just \ngenerally alleging fraud.\n  The President's veto message also objected to the discovery process. \nTo put it plainly, once a lawyer files a frivolous lawsuit, with little \nor no facts, he gets the ability to engage in discovery. This allows \nhim or her to rifle through the records of a company looking for \nanything with any particular spin that smacks of fraud. He does not \nhave to have anything when he starts. He gets it after he files his \nsuit.\n\n  Mr. President, 80 percent of the cost of litigation is in the \ndiscovery process. This bill would stop the discovery process while a \nmotion to dismiss is being deliberated. In other words, the court has \nto find that the complaint has merit before the company has to spend \ntime and money responding to voluminous document requests.\n  This goes to the heart of this bill: File a lawsuit and then ask for \nthe world in discovery and hope that the company settles the suit to \navoid the cost of litigation. The lawyers take home a tidy sum of money \nfor very little work. This is what we are trying to stop, and that is \nthe blackmailing of corporate America.\n  Let me just say a word about the safe harbor provision. This is \ncritically important to the flow of information for investors. Right \nnow, companies are literally frightened to project their earnings, or \nanything else for that matter, because if they do and it happens to \nturn out wrong, then they are going to be sued for fraud. They cannot \neven give an honest projection of what they might make, because if it \nhappens to be wrong, if a change in circumstances, events, business \ndown, up, they are subject to fraud.\n  Big investors and small ones alike, mutual funds, pension funds, \nanybody that is investing needs this kind of information projection to \nmake wise and prudent investment decisions. It is a shame that due to \nthe actions of a small group of parasitic lawyers that the free flow of \ninformation has been muzzled, that you simply cannot find out what a \ncompany plans to do or can do.\n  Mr. President, another important reform that is being made by H.R. \n1058 is reform of proportionate liability rules. This bill requires \nthat those who are responsible for causing a loss pay their fair share \nof the loss but no more. If they cause 1 percent of the loss, they pay \n1 percent. This is the way it should be.\n  Too many lawyers have gone after companies looking for the deep \npockets, and this can be anybody that had anything to do with the \noperation of the company. It can be lawyers, accounting firms--anyone \nthat was touched. So they are simply looking for the deep pockets. In \nmany cases, a lawyer would not even bother to file the suit but for the \ndeep pockets of the attorney firm or accountants, whoever might be \ninvolved.\n  Despite this provision, there are some circumstances when individuals \nwill pay more than they really owe. For example, we have a so-called \nwidows and orphans provision that imposes joint and several liability \non everyone to cover the losses for persons with net worth below \n$200,000. In other words, it is protecting those people of less than \n$200,000, and everyone has to pony up to pay their claim.\n  Further, if a defendant is insolvent, other parties have to \ncontribute another 50 percent of their liability to make up for the \ninsolvent defendant.\n  On this particular point, the conference report goes a long way \ntoward protecting small investors financially. They will not be left \nout in the cold if the principal target is insolvent. Small investors \nwill be fully protected. Those who have a net worth over $200,000 will \nbe fairly compensated.\n  Finally, anyone who knowingly commits fraud will be fully liable. \nThere is no retreat from this. If they knowingly commit fraud, they are \nfully liable.\n  Mr. President, I am a strong supporter of securities litigation \nreform, and I am a supporter of overall legal reform. I hope this is \njust the beginning. Some have suggested that the indirect cost of all \nthis litigation is $300 billion a year.\n  This is a heavy price for American business and industry to pay. It \nis a heavy tax on the American public for the rights of a few lawyers \nwho engage in these frivolous strike suits.\n  Mr. President, the SEC has sent a letter to the committee in which \nthey state that the conference report addresses their ``principal \nconcern.''\n  Mr. President, the Washington Post called it a truly useful piece of \nlegislation.\n  As I said earlier, this bill is too important to our economy not to \noverride the President's veto. I urge the Senate to vote to override \nthis veto. I simply feel that American industry and American business--\nparticularly the high-technology businesses--have simply fallen victim \nto the piranha-type lawyer who goes after them whether there is any \njustification to his claim or not. But because of the cost of the \nlawsuit, he gleans a lot of money.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DODD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Gorton). The Senator from Connecticut [Mr. \nDodd] is recognized.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, this is a moment of some unease, obviously, \nfor this particular Senator from Connecticut to be in a disagreement \nwith my President on this issue. But I am going to be urging my \ncolleagues to override the President's veto. I do so because I believe \nthis bill, passed previously in this body and adopted again in a \nconference report, is a good bill and one that deserves support.\n  I appreciate the arguments raised by the President. I have had the \nprivilege of discussing them with him and his staff over a number of \nmonths. And the President arrived at a different conclusion. I respect \nthat.\n  Much has been made of the fact that I have a second hat that I wear \nfrom time to time, that is called the general chairmanship of the \nDemocratic Party. I am very proud of that hat. As I said at the outset \nwhen I accepted that position, there would be times, I suspected, where \nmy President, the leader of my party, and I would disagree on issues. \nThis happens to be one of those moments. I hope there are not many, but \nit is one of those moments. So I regret that. Nevertheless, I feel that \nthis is an important bill, one that I have spent a great deal of time \non going back to 1991, when my colleagues--principally Senator Domenici \nof New Mexico--and others, began to work on this legislation in this \nbody, and through a process of numerous hearings and the like, we \narrived at the point we are at today.\n  I would like to take a few minutes, if I can, and discuss the matters \nof particular controversy at this moment and why I think that an \noverride is appropriate.\n  First of all, I point out to my colleagues--and I think I heard my \ncolleague from New Mexico make this point when he was addressing the \nChamber earlier this morning--this is \n\n[[Page S19066]]\ntruly a bipartisan bill, Mr. President. I realize that may not sound \nlike much. It is certainly not a justification for supporting it. \nUnfortunately, there are fewer and fewer occasions when we have truly \nbipartisan bills like this. It is worthy of note because an awful lot \nof people on both sides of the aisle here have worked very hard to put \nthis bill together. Is it a perfect bill? I suspect not. I have never \nseen one of those in my tenure here in Congress. Have we done \neverything exactly right? Probably not. Only time will tell where we \nhave to make some corrections. But we have addressed some fundamental \nunderlying problems that, by most people's comments, admittedly needed \nto be corrected. Those are the principal concerns.\n  I am grateful, in fact, that the President in his veto statement \nacknowledges that. We are no longer debating safe harbor, which was a \nmatter of great controversy, or proportionate liability. We are no \nlonger debating an issue my colleague from North Carolina pointed out a \nfew moments ago, the right of the most injured plaintiffs to have at \nleast the opportunity--it does not require it--but at least the \nopportunity to be the lead plaintiffs in the case, to require that in \nsettlements or in judicial conclusions that the plaintiffs have an \nopportunity to get the award, and that the attorneys will take a second \nseat to the plaintiffs when it comes to divvying up the money that may \ncome to them as a result of settlements, or a judicial award.\n  These are the principal matters in this piece of legislation. And the \nPresident, in his veto message, agrees with us on virtually all of \nthem. In fact, in his comments--and I commend him for them--he has said \nthis is a good bill. He has problems with two areas: pleadings and rule \n11. I do not say they are unimportant, but certainly when you weigh \nthem in the context of the overall bill, it amounts to just a handful \nof words--a fraction, if you will, of the overall achievement in the \nlegislation.\n  So the bipartisan nature of this legislation, I think, is very, very \nimportant, and shortly I will discuss the specific concerns that I have \nmentioned, the pleadings area and the rule 11 area.\n  As I mentioned earlier, we have been debating this bill for going on \nmore than 4 years now, into our third Congress on this legislation. \nSome 1,600 days have passed since the legislation was first introduced \nin 1991. There have been 12 public congressional hearings on this bill. \nThat is an inordinately high number of congressional hearings on any \nsingle piece of legislation. Yet, that is how many have been held on \nthis bill.\n  We have had 95 witnesses appear before congressional committees, \nrepresenting all the different points of view, on securities litigation \nreform. We have had more than 4,000 pages of testimony, been a part of \nthe legislative history that has led us to this bill that is now before \nus under these procedural circumstances.\n  There have been a half dozen staff and committee reports issued on \nthe substance of the legislation, and, in fact, we have debated this \npiece of legislation for 7 full days over this past year here on the \nfloor of the U.S. Senate.\n  Given this lengthy history, it is particularly disappointing that a \nveto of the bill has occurred, based on the issues that, frankly, have \nnever previously been the subject of most of the contention and most of \nthe debate. In fact, the President has stated his support, as I said \nearlier, for many of the most discussed and central issues, like the \nsafe harbor provisions, proportionate liability provisions, the new \nlead plaintiff provisions, prohibitions on professional plaintiffs, and \nthe discretionary bonding provisions. None of those issues should be \nthe topic of our discussion today because, candidly, the President said \nhe agrees with these issues.\n  What we are talking about are the issues he says he is in \ndisagreement with. It is not an overstatement to say that his veto \nmessage indicates his support for about 95 percent of this legislation, \nand his veto is based on somewhere between 5 percent and 1 percent of \nthe issues that are included in this bill.\n  In fact, when you boil it down, Mr. President, we are having a fight \nover 11 words--11 words out of over 11,000 words in the bill itself. \nEleven words are the subject of the veto.\n  So the President vetoed this bill because of a relatively small \npercentage of the matters included in the legislation and apparently \nsome wording in the statement of managers. It is somewhat rare that a \nveto would involve a statement of managers, but nonetheless, that was \nincluded in the veto message as well. So, Mr. President, I intend, \nobviously, no disrespect at all to the President, but this is the first \nveto I can recall where part of a veto message was based on a statement \nof managers.\n  As we discuss the issues upon which the President vetoed the \nconference report, it is important to remember some of the official \nstatements that the administration has previously made, some of which \ndirectly contradict the veto message itself. Let me begin with the \npleading standards, if I may.\n  Back in May of this year the Senate Banking Committee codified the \nessence of the pleading standards of the U.S. Second Circuit Court of \nAppeals. Then on June 23 of this year, S. 240, the bill before us moved \nto the floor. The administration, as administrations do, issued its \nstatement of policy in which it praised the pleading standards ``as \nsensible and workable.'' That was the administration's statement of \npolicy regarding the pleading standards in June of this year. The only \ndifference between those pleading standards that were applauded in June \nand those endorsed by the administration, the ones before us today, are \nthree words--the only difference between what was in the bill in June \nwhen the statement of policy came out and what is before you today are \nthree words that have changed, and the words represent a technical \nchange requested, by the way, by the Judicial Conference of the United \nStates Federal Judiciary. These are not words we came up with. They \nwere not words of the opponents or proponents, but they were altered at \nthe recommendation of the Judicial Conference, in a letter from Judge \nAnthony Scirica to the committee staff when asked to give their \ncomments on the pleading standards.\n  I know it has been included in the Record, but I ask unanimous \nconsent that the letter dated October 31, 1995, be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                            U.S. Court of Appeals,\n\n\n                                                Third Circuit,\n\n                               Philadelphia, PA, October 31, 1995.\n     Ms. Laura Unger,\n     Mr. Robert Giuffra,\n     Senate Committee on Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs, \n         Dirksen Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Laura and Bob: I have a few suggestions for your \n     consideration on the Rule 11 issue.\n       Page 24, line 11: Insert ``complaint'' before ``responsive \n     pleading.''\n       Page 24, line 19: Insert ``substantial'' before \n     ``failure.''\n       ``Complaint'' would be added to item (i), so there is a \n     clear provision that reaches any failure of the complaint to \n     comply with Rule 11. A small offense would be met by \n     mandatory attorney fees and expenses caused by the offense; \n     if item (ii) is modified without this change, a gap is left \n     in the statutory scheme. The result still is a big change \n     from present Rule 11, which restricts an award of attorney \n     fees to a sanction ``imposed on motion and warranted for \n     effective deterrence.'' A serious offense--filing an \n     unfounded action--would be reached under item (ii).\n       I also wish to confirm our prior conversation on scienter \n     and the pleading requirement.\n       Page 31, line 5: Delete ``set forth all information'' and \n     insert in its place ``state with particularity.''\n       Page 31, line 12: Delete ``specifically allege'' and insert \n     in its place ``state with particularity.''\n       As I indicated, this would conform with the existing \n     language in Rule 9(b) which provides that ``the circumstances \n     constituting fraud or mistake shall be stated with \n     particularity.''\n       Also, page 24, line 1: Delete ``entering'' and substitute \n     ``making.''\n       Page 24, line 4: Delete ``of its finding.''\n       Many thanks.\n           Sincerely,\n                                               Anthony J. Scirica.\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, let me describe what the three words are so \nmy colleagues know what we are talking about. The words that we had in \nthe bill were ``specifically allege facts giving rise to a strong \ninference of fraud.'' That was the language we had--``specifically \nallege facts giving rise to a strong inference of fraud.'' What the \nJudicial Conference recommended was that we change that language to \n``state with particularity facts giving rise to a \n\n[[Page S19067]]\nstrong inference of fraud.'' So the change went from ``specifically \nallege'' to ``state with particularity.''\n  That is the change that occurred from the language that was applauded \nin June by the administration and in its statement of policy as to \nwhere it stood on the bill and what was adopted in the conference \nreport. The change occurred without a great debate or a thunder and \nlightning storm or a conference in which the sides were in contentious \nargument. This recommendation of the Judicial Conference was accepted \nas something the conferees felt made sense.\n  So we did what the judges asked us to do, which is, I thought, how \nyou normally proceed. You ask people who will be sitting on these \nmatters to give us their recommendations--they are not Democrats, \nRepublicans, named in a partisan debate--but merely their \nrecommendations to the conference report.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. DODD. If I could complete my whole comment because I want to get \nto the Specter amendment.\n  Mr. SARBANES. I was not clear what conference the Senator was \nreferring to about thunder and lightning.\n  Mr. DODD. In the conference between the House and the Senate.\n  Mr. SARBANES. There was no legitimate conference. There were meetings \nof all the same-thinking types, and then a meeting of the conference \ncommittee was called to which everyone came, including people who had a \ndifferent point of view, and the thing was simply railroaded through.\n  Obviously, there was not thunder and lightning and this so-called \nconference--there was no such conference.\n  Mr. DODD. If I may regain the floor, maybe my colleague was not at \nthe same conference meeting I was, but I certainly recall a lot of \nthunder and lightning in the meeting about statements being made about \nwhat was in the bill.\n  Mr. SARBANES. But no discussion of substance. The true thinkers had \nworked all the substance out at other secret meetings before they ever \ncame to the conference. The Senator knows that as well as I do.\n  Mr. DODD. If this were the decision of my colleague from Maryland to \nhave vetoed this bill, he would have vetoed the bill, but he would not \nhave vetoed the bill on the basis of pleadings. He would have vetoed \nthe bill because he fundamentally disagrees with the legislation. I \nrespect that.\n  But I was talking about the administration's position when it comes \nto the veto. The administration's position in June, when it came to the \npleadings, was ``to support the pleading standards that were included \nin the bill'' that came out of the Banking Committee. When we went to \nconference there were no comments made by the administration that they \ndisagreed at all with the change of language of ``specifically allege'' \nto ``state with particularity.''\n  That is the point in the veto message. I expect my colleagues have \nmuch more fundamental disagreements with the bill than the President, \nbut we are talking about the Presidential veto.\n  The judges, I might point out, did not request out of thin air that \nthe language be changed. The requested change in the language of the \nstatute, we were told, was to conform with the language of rule 9(b) of \nthe Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, which governs how attorneys \nshould draft fraud complaints.\n  Mr. President, there is absolutely no substantive difference between \nthe phrase ``specifically allege'' and the phrase ``state with \nparticularity.'' The only difference, and the reason that the Federal \njudges wanted the change, is that ``particularity'' already has a \nmeaning under law and ``specifically allege'' does not. Therefore, this \nchange would produce a clearer, more consistent standard in the \npleadings section of the legislation.\n  I also note, Mr. President, in April of this year the Chairman of the \nSecurities and Exchange Commission, Arthur Levitt, urged the Banking \nCommittee to adopt--and I quote from the testimony before the \ncommittee--``the second circuit pleading requirement that plaintiffs \nplead with particularity''--he said--``facts that give rise to strong \ninference of fraudulent intent by the defendant.''\n  I think it is particularly distressing, Mr. President, that the \nadministration has reversed course on the pleading standards based on \nthis technical change requested by the impartial Judicial Conference of \nthe United States.\n  A final note, if I can, regarding this particular section, on the \nlegislative history to which the White House has objected. The White \nHouse has endorsed the pleading standards for the same language in the \nBanking Committee report on S. 240. Neither bill codifies the entire \ncase law of the second circuit, as the administration says it wishes it \ndid, and that is one of the reasons it has expressed its objection. The \nWhite House has also raised the issue of the Specter amendment, which \nwas added to S. 240 several days after the administration endorsed the \npleading standards in the bill that came to the floor of the U.S. \nSenate.\n  Now, our good friend from Pennsylvania, I gather, has already \naddressed this issue on the floor of the Senate earlier today and, of \ncourse, at the time he offered the amendment and at the time we adopted \nthe conference report. As he claimed, his amendment would codify \nguidance on how plaintiffs who establish the strong inference of fraud. \nThe difference was not over the issues of ``state with particularity'' \nor ``specifically allege'' wording, but rather, how do you establish \nthe strong inference of fraud?\n  Unfortunately, because the Specter amendment failed to include key \nguidance from the second circuit, it would have had the effect of \ntotally undermining the pleading standards that we were seeking to \nestablish and that have been supported by both the Securities and \nExchange Commission and the White House in its earlier statements.\n  Let me go into this, if I may. First, I want to read to my \ncolleagues, if I can, a memorandum sent to the President of the United \nStates from Prof. Joseph Grundfest of the Stanford Law School and \npreviously a Commissioner with the Securities and Exchange Commission, \non the subject of pleadings standards and pending securities reform \nlegislation. He is one of the most knowledgeable people in this \nparticular area:\n\n       The pleading standard articulated by the Second Circuit \n     Court of Appeals is intended simply to require the plaintiff \n     to allege facts sufficient to give rise to a strong inference \n     of motive to defraud. Plaintiffs must do more than make bald \n     assertions as to motive, but are not required to develop the \n     entire case in the pleadings. While this standard differs \n     from the standard applied in some more lenient circuits, \n     particularly the Ninth Circuit, it has not resulted in over-\n     deterrence in the Second Circuit or in excessive dismissals. \n     Indeed, the Second Circuit remains one of the most active in \n     the country for 10b-5 claims.\n       As I read the securities litigation conference report, the \n     pleading standard is faithful to the Second Circuit's test. \n     Indeed, I concur with the decision to eliminate the Specter \n     amendment language, which was an incomplete and inaccurate \n     codification of case law in the circuit.\n       As is stated in a recent Harvard Law Review article, \n     codification of a uniform pleading standard in 10b-5 cases \n     would eliminate the current confusion among circuits. The \n     Second Circuit standard is among the most thoroughly tested, \n     and it also balances deterrence of unjustified claims with \n     the need to retain a strong private right of action. Indeed, \n     the Second Circuit is widely respected for its legal \n     sophistication and acumen in matters relating to securities \n     and business litigation. The fact that the Second Circuit \n     evolved the strong inference standard is therefore worthy of \n     particular deference and respect.\n       In short, I support the pleading provision of the \n     conference report.\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the memorandum from Professor \nGrundfest at Standford Law School be printed in the Record at this \npoint.\n  There being no objection, the memorandum was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                               Memorandum\n\n     To: President Clinton, Through Elena Kagan, Office of the \n         White House Counsel.\n     From: Professor Joseph A Grundfest, Stanford Law School, \n         Commissioner, Securities and Exchange Commission, 1985-\n         1990.\n     Subject: Pleading Standard in Pending Securities Reform \n           Legislation.\n     Date: December 19, 1995.\n       The pleading standard articulated by the Second Circuit \n     Court of Appeals is intended simply to require the plaintiff \n     to allege facts sufficient to give rise to a strong inference \n     of motive to defraud. Plaintiffs must do more than make bald \n     assertions as to motive, but are not required to develop the \n     entire case in the pleadings. While this standard differs \n     from the standard applied in some more lenient circuits, \n     particularly the Ninth Circuit, it has not resulted in over-\n     deterrence in \n\n[[Page S19068]]\n     the Second Circuit or in excessive dismissals. Indeed, the Second \n     Circuit remains one of the most active in the country for \n     10b-5 claims.\n       As I read the securities litigation conference report, the \n     pleading standard is faithful to the Second Circuit's test. \n     Indeed, I concur with the decision to eliminate the Specter \n     amendment language, which was an incomplete and inaccurate \n     codification of case law in the circuit.\n       As is stated in a recent Harvard Law Review article, \n     codification of a uniform pleading standard in 10b-5 cases \n     would eliminate the current confusion among circuits. The \n     Second Circuit standard is among the most thoroughly tested, \n     and it also balances deterrence of unjustified claims with \n     the need to retain a strong private right of action. Indeed, \n     the Second Circuit is widely respected for its legal \n     sophistication and acumen in matters relating to securities \n     and business litigation. The fact that the Second Circuit \n     evolved the strong inference standard is therefore worthy of \n     particular deference and respect.\n       In short, I support the pleading provision of the \n     conference report.\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, our colleague from Pennsylvania, when he \noffered his amendment on the floor of the Senate, said that what he \nwanted to do was to take the guidance from the second circuit and \ncodify that as well.\n  With all due respect to my colleague from Pennsylvania, the language \nof his amendment did not really cover all of the guidance. His \namendment stated that ``strong inference of fraudulent intent for \npurposes of paragraph 1, a strong inference that the defendant acted \nwith the required state of mind, may be required, either, A, by \nalleging facts to show that the defendant had both motive and \nopportunity to commit fraud or, B, by alleging facts that constitute \nstrong circumstantial evidence of conscious misbehavior or recklessness \nby the defendant.''\n  What is my problem with that? The problem with it is that is not the \nguidance. He omits what Judge Newman has included as his guidance, and \nthe guidance that was not included in the amendment says, for part B, \n``where motive is not apparent.'' Where motive is apparent, you do not \nhave to make any allegations of a lot of circumstances. If you have a \nclear motive, you do not have to worry about the circumstances or the \nalleged strong facts. Where you do not have motive, apparently, and \nthat can be a case where it is hard to get at that motive, then you are \ngoing to allege circumstances. There Judge Newman says, ``Where motive \nis not apparent, it is still possible to plead scienter by identifying \ncircumstances indicating conscious behavior by the defendant, though \nthe strength of the circumstantial allegations must be correspondingly \ngreater.'' Greater. The Specter amendment did not distinguish at all \nbetween the circumstances in part A or part B of his amendment, and \ntherefore did not really follow the guidance of the second circuit. So \nthat is the reason that amendment was taken out.\n  You could have gone in, I suppose, and said why did you not include \nthe other language here? The problem was, in a sense, by codifying \nguidance you get into an area where you can get some differences of \nopinion on this. And arguably it could have, I suppose, gone back and \nincluded all of it, but the decision was to take it out on the \nassumption that courts will look to the guidance.\n  We have established the standard clearly. We have clearly established \nthe standard of alleging facts with particularity, showing a strong \ninference of motive. Then the guidance of the court would be followed.\n  But the suggestion that the standard and--the guidance, rather, was \nincluded in the Specter amendment, omits--omits that where a motive is \nnot apparent, the strength of circumstantial allegations must be \ncorrespondingly greater. That was omitted. And that is the reason that, \nwith all due respect to the administration, they are, I think, hanging \ntheir hat on the wrong issue here.\n  We have met the second circuit standard here, as indicated by the \nmemorandum from Judge Grundfest, Professor Grundfest at Stanford. We \nhave met that standard. We have left out the guidance. That does not \nmean you disregard it. But if you are going to follow the guidance, as \nSenator Specter suggested, then the guidance must include, in part B, \nthat you have circumstantial allegations that are correspondingly \ngreater than they would be if the motive was apparent.\n  So that is the first issue and frankly it is a marginal issue, I \nwould say. It has some importance. I do not disregard it. But to \nsuggest somehow this bill ought to be vetoed over that, I think is not \ncorrect.\n  I am not going to dwell at length on the rule 11 issues, except to \nmake the following applications. The intent and application of the rule \n11 provisions of the conference report are identical to the rule 11 \nprovisions from S. 240 that the administration states in the veto \nmessage that it now has difficulty with. In fact, the only difference \nin the configuration of this provision in S. 240 is the Senate adopted \na sanction for rule 11 that allowed a victim of a violation to collect \nthe legal fees and costs incurred as a direct result of the violation. \nThe conference report simply makes clear that it was our intent, that a \nsubstantial violation, a substantial violation in the initial complaint \ncould trigger sanctions that included all attorney's fees and costs for \nthe entire action.\n  That was our intent anyway. If you file a complaint that does not \nmeet--that would fall under rule 11, and I will not read all four areas \nwhere a motion or a complaint would be deficient in terms of rule 11--\nbut, if you have initiated a complaint and at the end of the action the \njudge goes back and says that complaint that you brought--and these \nhave to be substantial violations--did not meet that standard, it is \nlogical that it would have to apply to the entire proceeding.\n  If you brought a frivolous lawsuit, initiated a frivolous lawsuit, \nthen all of the costs come thereafter.\n  You do not apply that same standard with motions, obviously, assuming \nthe complaint does not violate rule 11. But if a defense lawyer brings \na motion that is frivolous, then the costs associated with that, \nobviously would have to be borne by the defense lawyers as well, \nregarding that motion. So, logic would indicate that there is a \ndifference here.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. DODD. I will be glad to yield.\n  Mr. SARBANES. The defense would not be held liable for all the costs? \nPlaintiff would but not the defense?\n  Mr. DODD. Yes, they would be. My point was this: if--Let us assume \nfor a second that the initial complaint is a frivolous complaint. The \ninitiation of the action, what begins it, violates rule 11, is a \nsubstantial violation of rule 11, and then at the end of that case the \njudge finds that there was a substantial violation of that, then the \ncosts associated with that entire case, because the initiation of the \naction was wrong.\n  Whereas, if a defense lawyer, in the process of handling the case, \nfiles a motion that violates rule 11, then the costs associated with \nthat motion, as I understand it, would then be borne by the defense \ncounsel incurring plaintiff's attorney's fees.\n  Mr. SARBANES. If the Senator will yield, I find that an absolutely \nstaggering assertion, saying that you should have this disparity in \ntreatment between plaintiff and the defense.\n  The Senate-passed bill contained a presumption that the appropriate \nsanction was an award of reasonable attorney's fees and other expenses \nincurred as a direct result of the violation, and it applied that to \nboth plaintiff and the defendant, as the bill went out of the Senate.\n  The conference changed that. So they imposed a much more onerous \nburden upon plaintiff as compared with the defendant. There is no basis \nin logic or reason to do that.\n  Mr. DODD. Oh, absolutely there is. Absolutely there is.\n  The costs associated are a direct result of the complaint. If you \nhave initiated the complaint here, and all the costs then come after, \nthat is the action that initiated the activity, it seems to me. That is \nthe reason. That was certainly--for those of us who were working on it, \nthat was the intent. At any rate, that is why. And then of course \nthereafter there is a balance.\n  But there is a distinction, obviously. If you start an action and you \nviolate rule 11 here--and for the sake of discussion you have brought \nan action which, to pick out in the first instance here, let us say No. \n1, under rule 11, ``under circumstance that is not being presented for \nany improper purpose such as to harass or cause unnecessary delay or \nneedless increased costs''--let us say ``to harass.'' You violated \nparagraph 1 \n\n[[Page S19069]]\nof rule 11. The sole purpose of your lawsuit was to harass. That is \nwhat you would have to be found guilty of. So you filed a complaint for \nsole purpose to harass a defendant. That is the reason you brought the \naction. If the court finds in fact that was the reason, I think the \nattorney who brought the action not for good cause but solely to harass \na defendant, and incurred costs thereafter that the defendant had to \npay to defend an action brought solely to harass the defendant--yes, I \ndo think that attorney should have to pay the cost of that entire case, \nif the sole purpose was to harass the defendant.\n  Mr. SARBANES. That would be the direct result of a violation under \nthe language of the Senate-passed bill. In the conference, they changed \nthis language.\n  Mr. DODD. No. I do not know.\n  Mr. SARBANES. They changed it in such a way that you get a disparate \ntreatment of the plaintiff and the defendant. There is no basis to do \nthat.\n  Mr. DODD. Let me finish my thought, if I can. Let me tell you what \nthe change is.\n  Mr. SARBANES. I apologize to the Senator.\n  Mr. DODD. Nevertheless, Mr. President, we also provided some \nprotections for plaintiffs, a presumptive sanction for initiating \nillegal litigation. It is not triggered unless the complaint \nsubstantially violates rule 11. So we added that part to it. There are \nplaintiffs who violate rule 11. Only plaintiffs file complaints, \nobviously, and so plaintiffs get the benefit of this heightened rule 11 \nthreshold. Plaintiffs face sanctions only if they committed, as I said, \na substantial violation.\n  So my point here again is that that was certainly our intent to begin \nwith. Again, I have stated earlier, I do not like the idea--my \ncolleagues may recall, and I see my friend from New Mexico is on the \nfloor here--that initially you had proposals that would have said, \n``Well, if you lose the case, you pay.'' That is the British rule.\n  I stated on this floor that I would vehemently oppose this \nlegislation if we had a ``loser pays'' provision. A person could have a \ngood case and lose the case. I would vehemently oppose any legislation \nthat would have such a chilling effect. A plaintiff who thinks they \nhave a good case--who thinks they have been harmed and injured because \nof a defendant's actions--and loses the case, we should make that \ndefendant pay the cost to the plaintiff.\n  That is a very different situation from a violation of rule 11, where \nthe action or the complaint is frivolous, or instances in which the \nplaintiff is out to harass defendants. In that case, frankly, I think \nthe attorney should pay. I think that is the best weapon we have here \nto discourage these frivolous lawsuits. You had better think twice. If \nyou are just going to file these things, make wild accusations not \nbased on fact, and in some cases just designed to harass people, by God \nyou ought to be asked to pay. And that is what people are angry about \nin this country because that is what has happened too often. \nUnfortunately, it is not usually the named defendants who pay. It is \nthe people that insure--the insurance companies--the people who work in \nthese places who end up paying. It usually is not the big guys at the \ntop. It is other people who work in these facilities, people who invest \nin them, or others who end up paying the bill. When that happens, there \nought to be a cost associated with it. Remember, it has to be a \nsubstantial violation in those particular matters.\n  Mr. President, let me also make abundantly clear that in making this \nchange, as I said earlier, we imposed a higher burden of proof in \nviolation of the complaint by a requirement of substantial. The entire \nintent of the legislation is to deter frivolous litigation from the \nbeginning.\n  As I said a moment ago, why should there not be some significant \nsanction for initiating an action that violates the standards of the \nFederal Rules of Civil Procedure? Why have rule 11? Maybe we should \nhave struck rule 11 entirely. If you are going to have rule 11 that \nsays if you harass people or bring frivolous lawsuits, rule 11 has \nexisted for decades. The problem is, it has only been a piece of paper. \nIt has hardly ever been invoked at all. It has never been a threat to \nanybody. Maybe we should have gotten rid of it altogether. Maybe we \nshould have done that to satisfy some people. If you are going to have \nit, make sure it means something. If you harass or bring a suit without \nany basis in fact, think twice about it. If there is no economic \npenalty to it, I do not know how to clean up the mess these frivolous \nsuits have created. That is why it is included.\n  Those are more protections, by the way. As I said earlier, we should \nnot forget that the conference report also gives the judge in these \ncases broad discretion to waive the sanction against the violating \nparty if the judge finds that the violation was de minimis or it would \nbe an unjust burden for the violator to pay the sanctions. Some might \nargue that we should not have included that. But, nevertheless, it is \nin there to have the judge find it is an unjust burden. We are not \ngoing to ask you to pay. You have to violate rule 11. There has to be \nfinding that you have violated this rule of bringing frivolous \nlawsuits--not that you lost or won the case, but that you violated rule \n11.\n  As I said, those are more protections for plaintiffs than currently \nexist in rule 11, which give no discretionary power to a judge to waive \nthe sanctions when he or she finds a violation of rule 11. Under \npresent law, if a judge found a violation of rule 11, then he or she \nhas to impose the sanctions. We provide some protection here for these \nplaintiffs' attorneys if in fact the judge does find that they have \nviolated--a substantial violation.\n  Mr. President, I am sure there will be ample opportunity to debate \nsome of these highly technical matters. I hope we would get to a vote \non this. I do not enjoy belaboring this issue. We spent days on this \nbill.\n  Let me say again that there are a number of my colleagues who \nfundamentally disagree with this bill. I respect that. I disagree with \nthem, but I understand their objections. But I have to repeat: I do not \nunderstand having been through this process now.\n  I was asked months ago--my colleagues ought to know this--to address \nsome concerns that the administration had with the bill, particularly \nwith safe harbor. There were a couple of other areas the administration \nhad problems with--aiding and abetting and the statute of limitations. \nI offered the amendment on the statute of limitations to give a longer \nperiod of time. I lost that in committee, and I lost it here on the \nfloor.\n  In the aiding abetting provisions, we provided half a loaf here by \nallowing the SEC to deal with the class actions. We did not go as far \nas some would like, even I would like. But it was a major point of \ncontention for the administration. In conversation after conversation \nafter conversation, it was safe harbor--fix safe harbor, Senator. Get \nthat safe harbor straightened out.\n  I cannot tell you the hours spent on the safe harbor issue because I \nwanted the President to sign this bill. I kept on telling them that if \nwe did fix safe harbor, I felt confident that the bill would be signed. \nWe worked for days on this, and ended up with language that was \nsupported by the Securities and Exchange Commission. It met their \nconcerns. In fact, the President in his veto message applauded us for \nhaving done it. He supports the safe harbor provision. And then I find \nout after the conference report is voted on that all of a sudden there \nare a couple of issues--not issues that are not of concern to my \ncolleagues on the floor who object to the bill. I understand that. But \nI must say to my colleagues, the issue of pleadings and rule 11 was \nnever a major issue, not to the administration. I was never asked by \nthe administration to address the pleadings or the rule 11 issue. The \nonly thing I was asked to address was safe harbor, aiding, abetting, \nand the statute of limitations. And on those two, there was an \nappreciation that we had done the best we could. But you do not veto a \nbill for what is not in the legislation.\n  I do not disagree that my colleagues here have difficulty with the \npleadings in rule 11, but we are talking about a veto here today and \nthe veto message. The veto message was on pleadings and rule 11 and \nsome language in the statement of managers. That is a very small \npercentage of this bill. It is 11 words out of 11,800 words in this \nbill--11 words. After 4 years, 12 congressional hearings, 100 \nwitnesses, 5,000 pages of testimony, we are down here about to lose \nthat kind of an effort over 11 words.\n  Mr. President, we did not write the Ten Commandants here. This is not \n\n\n[[Page S19070]]\netched in marble. I said this to my colleagues elsewhere. I have been \nmystified. Nobody would stand up with a bill and say that we have \noffered you the perfect piece of legislation. I cannot say that. I \nthink we have done a good job here in both Chambers of the Congress, \nthe House and the Senate, with Democrats and Republicans, and with 4 \nyears of effort. We have put together a good bill, and in my view we \nhave done it the way a bill ought to be adopted. Do we know it is \nperfect? No, we do not. If something comes up a year or two from now \nwhere there is a problem, you fix it.\n  We have had this problem of frivolous law suits for years, and we are \ntrying to fix it. We may lose the opportunity to do that because of \nsome people's concerns about things that I think, frankly, should not \nbe matters of concern, but if they turn out to be, we can correct them. \nBut you do not squander the opportunity to change a situation so \nfundamentally awry it screams out for solution.\n  Today, with great regret, with great regret, I urge my colleagues to \noverride this veto and to adopt this legislation by that action, and \nlet us get on with the business of other matters that are before this \nbody.\n  With that, Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. SARBANES addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I observe for my colleague from \nConnecticut that the two words ``I do''--it is only two words--but they \nhave tremendous, far-reaching significance. So the fact that there are \nonly 11 words, you know, if they are critical 11 words they can make a \ntremendous difference, and in the lives of people there are the two \nwords ``I do.'' They can make an enormous difference in our lives.\n  Mr. DODD. If my colleague will yield, I will not disagree on that, \nhaving said ``I do'' on occasion. Some of our colleagues have said ``I \ndo'' on many occasions. But I appreciate the significance of what he is \nsaying. I am merely trying to put it into balance.\n  Mr. SARBANES. If there are only 11 words, why do you not take this \nbill and rewrite it and meet the objections?\n  It is interesting. I find it very interesting that this is being \ntreated as though Congress were about to end. The fact of the matter is \nthat there is an opportunity to address these problems, eliminate them. \nActually, I am not going to go at great length here because I \nunderstand the distinguished Senator from Minnesota wishes to speak.\n  I can address this problem later, but I am going to quote from some \nof these leading law professors in the country about the problems they \nsee in this legislation. Now, I just want to make a couple of points \nhere though because we were trying to have an exchange and I wish to \nregister them at this point in the Record.\n  It is interesting; there is a lot in this legislation that those of \nus who have opposed its support. We do not disagree with trying to \nfashion legislation to deal with the problem of frivolous lawsuits, and \nthere is much in this legislation that we would support. There are \nother things that are not in it that we think ought to be in it, which \nwe have debated, and there are things in it which we think ought not to \nbe in it, which is the focus obviously of the current attention.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Could I ask the Senator one question?\n  Mr. SARBANES. I yield to the Senator for a question.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I listened to the Senator's remarks to my friend, \nSenator Dodd, when we talked about 11 words.\n  Why does the Senator not draft a bill with those 11 words. It ought \nto be easy to pass an 11-word bill.\n  Mr. SARBANES. I am not sure it will be because--first of all, I do \nnot know that it is only 11 words that are at issue, and I do not think \nthat is correct. But, in any event, those provisions were not included \nin this legislation and were resisted very strongly by those, whoever \nbrought the measure to the floor, and yet they have a significant \nimpact on what the effect of this legislation will be.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I mean, would it not be a pretty good debate on 11 \nwords? The Senator could get that to our committee, and we could debate \nthe 11 words instead of killing the bill.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Well, the President sent the veto here, and the issue \nis whether to sustain the veto. I think we should sustain the veto.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Yes, indeed.\n  Now, let me address a couple of other things. The Senator from \nConnecticut spoke about the thunder and lightning at the conference on \nthis legislation. And I say to the Senator, I was a member of the \nconference committee. I only remember it meeting once. Am I erroneous \nin that remembrance?\n  Mr. DODD. Far be it for the Senator from Connecticut to challenge the \nSenator's remembrances. I do not know if the Senator is erroneous or \nnot in his remembrance. I do not know how many actual meetings \noccurred. There were a lot of conferences.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Of the conference committee.\n  Mr. DODD. I would suggest this is not a unique event. It is common to \nhave back and forth, and so forth, at meetings. Rather than having \nMembers sit, staff does this. I know the Senator from Maryland, having \nchaired committees and conferences, knows it is not uncommon in these \nmeetings to have staffs work back and forth to try to resolve matters \nwithout Members sitting there. It is not unique. Is that a unique \noccurrence?\n  Mr. SARBANES. I say to my colleague from Connecticut, the procedure \nhere that was unusual and somewhat unique, although it is becoming more \nfrequent--I regret to say in the workings of this Congress, it is \nbecoming more frequent--was that all the true believers gathered \ntogether to try to work out the House and Senate differences but did \nnot include in those discussions the people who were on the other side.\n  Now, that is not a good way to legislate, in my opinion, because \nsometimes by having the people on the other side, you have a dialog and \na discussion, and you are able to work out measures and improve them.\n  Now, what happened here, that never took place. What finally took \nplace that encompassed everybody including those who were critical of \nthis legislation was the final meeting where they simply railroaded \nthrough what the conference agreement was, and it is the conference \nagreement that has provoked the President's veto in this instance. The \nPresident, in fact, has indicated that if he had been given a bill as \nit had passed the Senate, he would have signed it, as I understand it. \nSo it is conference action that did it, and the conference action was \ntaken by all, any meaningful action on the substance was taken simply \nby those on one side of issue.\n  Mr. DODD. If my colleague will yield further----\n  Mr. SARBANES. Certainly.\n  Mr. DODD. The bill that is before us, except for a couple of \nprovisions, some of which we would argue improve the bill, is virtually \nwhat the Senate adopted. This is not a bill that even remotely looks \nlike the House-passed bill. In fact, it is the Senate-passed bill. I \nknow my colleague from Maryland was opposed to even the Senate-passed \nbill. But in terms of from the administration's standpoint, again I \npoint out that in June on the pleading standards and the statement of \npolicy from the administration, they endorsed what came out of the \nSenate bill. And regarding the rule 11----\n  Mr. SARBANES. If the Senator will yield on that very point, it was \nchanged then in the conference. The fact that the administration----\n  Mr. DODD. The only thing that was changed, the only thing that was \nchanged was at the recommendation of the Judicial Conference, and it \nwas regarding the words ``effectively allege\" or ``state with \nparticularity.'' Those words were recommended by the Judicial \nConference.\n  Mr. SARBANES. No, two other things were done. In the conference, they \nremoved the Specter amendment that had been adopted in the Senate that \ncarried with it further elaborations, carried with it further \nelaborations by the second circuit with respect to the pleading \nstandard, and second--and this is something the President focused on in \nhis veto message--the statement of managers about the pleading standard \nin effect sought to put a legislative interpretation spin on it which \nraised the standard even higher, and some of the law school deans \n\n[[Page S19071]]\nwho have written in about this matter have focused on that very fact.\n  In other words, what you did is you changed the standard as it passed \nthe Senate to make it more difficult and then the statement of managers \nput a further spin on it.\n  Mr. DODD. If my colleague will yield, let me go back. I tried to do \nthis earlier. The Specter amendment said he was codifying the guidance \nin the second circuit, and that is not the case. That is where the \nproblem occurred here.\n  Mr. SARBANES. I listened to the Senator's comments on that subject, \nand the distinguished Senator from Pennsylvania will have to speak for \nhimself, but even assuming the accuracy of what the Senator stated--and \nI am not in a position to do that. The Senator from Pennsylvania, I am \nsure, will be able to do so. Assuming the accuracy, then the way to \nhave corrected it would have embraced all the guidance, not to \neliminate that guidance, which was designed to provide some additional \nprotection for the investors as the second circuit elaborated their \nstandard.\n  Mr. DODD. If my colleague will yield further--I appreciate him \nyielding--you can make that case.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Yes, you can.\n  Mr. DODD. I understand that. But the suggestion that somehow the \ncourts are going to disregard the guidance because it is no longer in \nthe bill itself, it has not been codified, I think overstates the case, \nwhen you come down to vetoing this whole bill on that particular \nquestion. My point simply has been that I do not think the Specter \namendment was--I think it was an effort to get recklessness in, which \nwould have changed the standard from the second circuit. Nonetheless, \nputting that aside, the guidance is still going to be there. The \nguidance would still be there. And you do not veto the whole bill over \nthe issue of guidance.\n  Mr. SARBANES. If the Senator will yield, you not only took the \nguidance out of the statute from the second circuit but you sought to \ngive the courts a different guidance contained in the statement of \nmanagers in the conference report. So you committed, as it were, a \ndouble violation. You took out the guidance of the second circuit. Then \nyou say, well, if it is not there, the courts will look to the guidance \nin any event. Ah, but what you did is you then interjected in as \nguidance with respect to this provision a statement of managers.\n  Mr. DODD. First of all, Mr. President, I say to my colleague, it was \nthe guidance of the second circuit, No. 1. And by taking it out, the \nstatement of managers is--again, one I have never heard. Maybe my \ncolleague can cite examples where there is some confusion over what was \nintended there, but you do not veto a whole bill over the statement of \nmanagers.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Well, this bill with respect to the statement of \nmanagers is obviously an effort to in part rewrite the bill at that \nlevel of consideration.\n  Now, Mr. President, let me make one other point while my colleague is \nstill here. My colleague made a lot about the number of hearings that \nwere held, but I have to submit to you that those hearings were in a \nsense ignored.\n  My distinguished friend from Connecticut earlier stated that with \nrespect to one provision--I think it was on safe harbor. He quoted \nArthur Levitt, the Chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission. \nBut let me just show you how these hearings are ignored. And so the \nfact that you have a lot of hearings may make no difference at all.\n  On May 12, 1994, the Securities Subcommittee held a hearing, which \nthe distinguished Senator from Connecticut chaired.\n  The Senator himself stated at that hearing:\n\n       Aiding and abetting liability has been critically important \n     in deterring individuals from assisting possible fraudulent \n     acts by others.\n\n  That is my colleague from Connecticut speaking at this hearing. \nTestifying at that hearing, Chairman Levitt, whom he cited earlier for \nanother provision in terms of supporting it, stressed the importance of \nrestoring aiding and abetting liability for private investors.\n\n       Persons who knowingly or recklessly assist in the \n     perpetration of a fraud may be insulated from liability to \n     private parties if they act behind the scenes and do not \n     themselves make statements directly or indirectly that are \n     relied upon by investors. Because this is conduct that should \n     be deterred, Congress should enact legislation to restore \n     aiding and abetting liability in private actions.\n\n  And the North American Securities Administrators Association, the \nAssociation of the Bar of the City of New York, also endorse \nrestoration of aiding and abetting liability in private actions.\n  So what good does the hearing do us? We have the hearing. This is \nwhat the testimony is. The distinguished Senator himself, in a sense, \nled off that hearing by underscoring the importance of aiding and \nabetting liability. And it ends up not being in the legislation.\n  So you can have all the hearings you want. It does not necessarily \ndemonstrate that an appropriate and reasonable piece of legislation has \nbeen crafted.\n  Mr. DODD. If my colleague would yield on that, as I said earlier, he \nmay have missed my statement. He may want to bring up the statute of \nlimitations issues as well. It is not in the bill. I offered the \namendment on that particular instance to include the legislation, as my \ncolleague well knows.\n  Mr. SARBANES. That is accurate. And I commend the Senator for doing \nthat.\n  Mr. DODD. As the saying goes, you make the perfect the enemy of the \ngood. We are a body of 100 Members here. There is not the political \nwill to do what the Senator from Maryland and I would like to do on \naiding and abetting. But let us consider what happens if the President \nprevails today and the veto is sustained.\n  What happens to the statute of limitations and aiding and abetting? \nObviously the statute of limitation does not change. The Supreme Court \nhas ruled on it, so there is no difference. It is not affected by this. \nBut on aiding and abetting we have made a substantial gain in aiding \nand abetting by restoring to the Securities and Exchange Commission the \nright to bring class actions. Without this legislation you even lose \nthat aiding and abetting.\n  So I regret deeply we do not have aiding and abetting here. The \nmajority of our colleagues have rejected that. But the suggestion that \nI ought to lose everything else I have achieved because I was not able \nto get a statute like the statute of limitations or aiding and abetting \nis not a reason to be against the bill.\n  I hope we can convince a number of people in the next couple months, \nin a separate bill, to expand the aiding and abetting and the statute \nof limitations. But I cannot see why I should be opposed to the whole \nbill here, when on portion of liability, on safe harbor, on lead \nplaintiffs and on aiding and abetting, where we do get half a loaf at \nleast, that the SEC wanted, and I am confident my colleague from \nMaryland wanted, and I wanted, that we would not have been able to get \nthat without this piece of legislation. I thank my colleague for \nyielding.\n  Mr. SARBANES addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland has the floor.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, let me just close out by including in \nthe Record a letter from the ABA, from the President of the American \nBar Association, to President Clinton opposing key provisions of the \nlegislation, H.R. 1058, and urging the President to veto the \nlegislation.\n  Let me just quote it very briefly:\n\n       The ABA continues to believe that this proposed legislation \n     can and should be corrected by the Congress to correct the \n     significant difficulties that it would cause in its current \n     state. We agree that underlying problems in the area of \n     securities litigation must be addressed, but that must happen \n     without unduly barring access to the courts to parties who \n     are defrauded.\n\n  And then they enumerate the most objectionable parts of H.R. 1058, \nincluding the rule 11 changes about which my colleague from Connecticut \nhas discussed, and particularly underscoring the fact that the \nprovision now lacks balance in that it treats plaintiffs more harshly \nthan defendants.\n  They also discuss the pleadings rules about which he has spoken, and \nin effect point out the difficulty it would present to people in having \ntheir cases heard, in other words, the danger that meritorious cases \nwill be dismissed at the pleadings stage. It goes on to make other \ncriticisms as well. \n\n[[Page S19072]]\n\n  Mr. President, later I intend to address these comments that we have \nreceived from some of our Nation's leading legal scholars----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is the Senator from Maryland going to make a \nunanimous-consent request?\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the letter \nbe printed in the Record at the end of my remarks that have been made \nwith respect to the provisions that are before us, letters to the \nPresident urging the veto of the bill, which the President made.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n\n                                     American Bar Association,\n\n                               Albuquerque, NM, December 17, 1995.\n     President William Jefferson Clinton,\n     The White House,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. President: I write on behalf of the American Bar \n     Association. The ABA opposes key provisions of legislation \n     presently before you entitled Reform of Private Securities \n     Litigation, H.R. 1058. I strongly urge you to veto the \n     legislation.\n       The ABA continues to believe that this proposed legislation \n     can and should be corrected by the Congress to correct the \n     significant difficulties that it would cause in its current \n     state. We agree that underlying problems in the area of \n     securities litigation must be addressed, but that must happen \n     without unduly barring access to the courts to parties who \n     are defrauded. The most objectionable parts of H.R. 1058 \n     include the following:\n       1. ``Loser Pays'' or Rule 11 Changes.--The ABA opposes any \n     requirement that would impose responsibility on a non-\n     prevailing party for the legal fees of the prevailing party \n     in securities actions. H.R. 1058 contains such a ``loser \n     pays'' provision and would materially change Federal Rule 11, \n     it is called a mandatory sanctions rule. That provision's \n     call for mandatory sanctions in the form of attorneys fees \n     and its lack of balance, treating plaintiffs more harshly \n     than defendants, are unacceptable.\n       2. Other Mandated Changes in Federal Rules for Securities \n     Cases.--H.R. 1058 significantly amends Rule 9(b) on pleadings \n     and Rule 23 on class actions. These because for the first \n     time under the Federal Rules, they would establish special \n     requirements for a particular class of cases.\n       Moreover, the proposals contradict the present Rule 9(b) of \n     the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. In light of the \n     evidence that courts today already enforce heightened \n     pleading requirements. Federal laws should not endorse the \n     dismissal of meritorious cases at the pleading stage. The \n     pleading standards in H.R. 1058 require a plaintiff to plead \n     the ``state of mind'' of each defendant, something utterly \n     impossible to do prior to discovery.\n       The ABA further opposes the proposed limitations on the \n     ability of plaintiffs to amend their pleadings and to pursue \n     discovery. Such limitations while undoubtedly preventing \n     frivolous claims from going forward, would also bar claims \n     with substantial merit. Only through significant discovery \n     and repleading do these important claims get adjudicated; \n     H.R. 1058 would subvert that process.\n       The ABA supports the process called for in the Rules \n     Enabling Act. No amendments to the federal rules should ever \n     occur except after the deliberative process of the Rules \n     Enabling Act has been followed. H.R. 1058 wreaks havoc with \n     that principle and violates the important principle that the \n     Federal Rules of Civil Procedure apply uniformly to all \n     causes of action.\n       3. Immunization of Intentional and Reckless Conduct.--The \n     ABA House of Delegates adopted policy at its last meeting in \n     February that opposed any legislation that eliminates the \n     concept of recklessness from that which is required to be \n     pled or proved in private actions under Rule 10 b-5. H.R. \n     1058 will compromise the principle that those who engage in \n     reckless conduct, to say nothing of intentional conduct, \n     should be held responsible under the federal securities acts. \n     The ABA opposes this legislation's grant of a safe harbor to \n     both intentional and recklessly issued misleading and false \n     statements.\n       4. Choice of Class Plaintiff and Joint and Several \n     Liability.--H.R. 1058 specifies that a wealth qualification \n     directs both the choice of class plaintiff provision and the \n     operation of the joint and several liability section. In one \n     case, you have to be rich enough to be named the class \n     representative and, in the other case, you have to be poor \n     enough to receive the benefits of joint and several liability \n     for reckless conduct. The ABA believes this provision of H.R. \n     1058 would bar access to the courts to shareholders with \n     small holdings.\n       On behalf of the American Bar Association, I urge you to \n     veto H.R. 1058. A veto would motivate Congress to make \n     changes needed so that the many laudable provisions of the \n     legislation may quickly become law.\n           Respectfully,\n                                              Roberta Cooper Ramo.\n\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. CHAFEE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I know the Senator from Minnesota is next. \nAnd my question to the Chair is, whether--I ask unanimous consent that \nI might follow the Senator from Minnesota when he has completed, and \nspeak as in morning business for 10 minutes.\n  Mr. REID addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I reserve the right to object. If I can \nenter a colloquy through the Chair to my friend from Rhode Island, \nthere are a number of us that have been wandering around here for \nseveral hours this afternoon. I am wondering if we might find out how \nlong people want to speak before we go into this situation where we \ngive the floor----\n  Mr. CHAFEE. I did not know the Senator was----\n  Mr. REID. Senator Pell is here.\n  Mr. PELL. I would like 2 minutes.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. How long might people be?\n  Mr. REID. It would be 2 minutes for the senior Senator from Rhode \nIsland. And the junior Senator from Nevada----\n  Mr. CHAFEE. I will follow the Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. How long is the Senator going to be?\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Senator Breaux and I were going to have a little colloquy \nfor 10, 15 minutes, so we would just as soon follow the Senator from \nNevada.\n  Mr. REID. Then if we could--so people know that are watching--if the \nSenator from Minnesota would speak, the senior Senator from Rhode \nIsland, and then the Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. President, I ask that the unanimous-consent request be amended, \nthat following that there be the time allotted to the Senator from \nRhode Island and the Senator from Louisiana.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is that request in the form of a unanimous-\nconsent?\n  Mr. REID. It is.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Reserving the right to object, how long does the \nSenator from Minnesota intend to speak?\n  Mr. GRAMS. About 10 minutes. I would defer to the Senator from Rhode \nIsland making a statement dealing with this pending business ahead of \nmy statement.\n  Mr. PELL. I thank my colleague.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Which Senator from Rhode Island?\n  Mr. GRAMS. The senior Senator.\n  Mr. REID. I ask unanimous consent the request be amended as reflected \nby the Senator from Minnesota.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Could I ask a question?\n  The Senator from Nevada, how long does he think he might be?\n  Mr. REID. About 20 minutes.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. I thank the Senator.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Under the \nunanimous-consent agreement, the senior Senator from Rhode Island is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. PELL. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, today the Senate is considering overriding President \nClinton's veto of the securities litigation reform bill. After careful \nreflection, I have decided to continue my long history of support for \nthis legislation.\n  In doing so, I wish to point out that I do not do so lightly. I \nadmire and honor our President immensely and have always respected the \nprerogative of our President in his use of the veto power and \nespecially so when this power is responsibly and sparingly used, as has \nbeen the case with President Clinton. I do believe the President has \nacted upon personal principle with regard to this bill and that his \ndecision was arrived at in a thoughtful and deliberate manner. \nNevertheless, I respectfully disagree and believe that this particular \nbill should become law.\n  I have been a longtime supporter of legal reform, especially measures \nwhich seek to reduce the excess and frivolous litigation so prevalent \nin our society. On this measure, I was one of the first Democrats to \njoin as a cosponsor some 4 years ago and have been active in promoting \nit ever since. As with any piece of legislation, the final product is \none of compromise and, indeed, does not contain every provision that I \nwould like. Nevertheless, it is a good, carefully considered, \nbipartisan effort \n\n[[Page S19073]]\nat addressing the very real and growing problems associated with \nexcessive and frivolous lawsuits besieging publicly held companies. As \nsuch, this bill deserves to be implemented into law.\n  I do regret being in the opposition in this matter but as a longtime \nadvocate for this legislation, I believe that this bill is both \nresponsible and necessary to address the need for litigation reform \nwith regard to our securities industry.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Chair now \nrecognizes the Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I want to thank the Chair very much, and I \nask unanimous consent that I be allowed to speak as in morning business \nfor up to 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Abraham). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/12/21/senate-section/article/S19060-2", "month": "12", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "21", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S19073-S19074]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           A WONDERFUL LIFE . . . OR JUST ANOTHER NIGHTMARE?\n\n  Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I know this is a very important debate that \nis going on dealing with securities litigation, but there is also an \nimportant debate going on today and has been going on for months, and \nthat is dealing with the budget.\n  The string of budgets that have been coming out of the White House \nlately reminds me of those movies called ``Nightmare on Elm Street.'' \nThey have a few good scares, mixed with a lot of unintentional comedy. \nThe emphasis clearly is on quantity, not quality, and they offer few, \nif any, redeeming values. There have been so many of them that after a \nwhile, you just start losing count.\n  Just to recap: We are talking budgets. We have had Clinton I. That \nfailed in the Senate 99 to 0;\n  Clinton II that did not get a single vote in the Senate as well, \nRepublican or Democrat;\n  Clinton III, that one was pulled before we could even vote on it;\n  And just last Friday, Clinton IV. The Senate did not waste our time \non it after the House late Wednesday dealt a resounding blow by \ndefeating it on a bipartisan vote of 412 to 0.\n  Four budgets submitted by President Clinton, four major \ndisappointments, and not one vote from a single Member of this Congress \nto support any of them.\n  What is it about the President's vision of a balanced budget that is \nso different from everyone else's? By refusing to use honest budget \nnumbers certified by the Congressional Budget Office, the President's \nbudgets have failed the first true test of a balanced budget: They \nnever come close to being balanced.\n  Yet, there are encouraging signs that the White House is shifting its \never-shifting budget policy and now wants to cooperate with Congress to \nproduce the kind of budget plan that the American people are demanding: \nA balanced budget attainable by the year 2002 that reaches balance by \ncutting the growth of Federal spending and does not raise taxes, that, \nin fact, cuts taxes.\n  Following his meeting Tuesday afternoon with Senator Dole and Speaker \nGingrich, I welcome the news that President Clinton has finally agreed \nto work with us, using the economic projections of the CBO, to craft a \nplan that will bring the Federal budget into balance within 7 years.\n\n  It was his refusal to commit to such a basic promise 6 days ago that, \nonce again, led to a Government shutdown, this time idling a quarter of \na million Federal employees. They, and the American people who are \nforced to pay the salaries of workers who are not allowed to work when \nthe Government shuts down, ought to be furious that the President would \nlet this happen, especially so close to the holidays.\n  I hope that by opening the door to now legitimate budget \nnegotiations, the President will sign an agreement reopening the \nGovernment and sending these people back to work immediately. As for \nthe balanced budget plan itself, President Clinton was quoted this week \nas saying, ``I hope we can resolve this situation and give the American \npeople their Government back by Christmas. We also should give them a \nbalanced budget that reflects our values of opportunity, respecting our \nduty to our parents and our children, building strong communities and a \nstrong America.''\n  I could not agree more with the President, but it seems he is doing \nhis Christmas shopping just a little late this year. By so far denying \nthe American people the benefits of a balanced budget, he is making the \ngoals that we share, those expanded opportunities, strong communities \nand a strong America, a lot more difficult to reach. Both the \nbusinesses lining Main Street and the Americans who spend their dollars \nin them are nervous, wondering if Washington is, once again, going to \nlet them down.\n  Monday's drop of more than 100 points in the stock market--and that \nis the worst drop in the market in 4 years--and yesterday's 50-point \ndive is a clear sign that a skittish business community is having real \ndoubts that Washington is serious about ever balancing the Federal \nbudget.\n  That lack of a balanced budget is causing real economic hardship for \nAmerican families, and individuals as well, because for the residents \nof my home State of Minnesota, the benefits that they would reap from \nour balanced budget legislation would be deep and it would be lasting.\n  The statistics tell it all. In fact, if President Clinton had signed \nthe Balanced Budget Act that we originally sent him last month, the \naverage Minnesotan would be saving right now $2,600 a year from lower \nmortgage payments; over $1,000 over the life of a 4-year loan of a car \nworth $15,000; nearly $1,900 on the life of a 10-year student loan of \nabout $11,000; and over $300 every year from lower State taxes due to \nlower State and local interest payments; and also, Mr. President, \nnearly $600 a year from lower interest payments on a student loan.\n\n  If President Clinton had signed the Balanced Budget Act, Minnesota \nfamilies would have received a tax credit as well, a tax credit that \nwould have helped over 529,000 Minnesota taxpayers with over 1 million \ndependents. That is more than $477 million of their own money every \nyear these working families would have been allowed to keep.\n  The tax credit would have completely eliminated the Federal income \ntax bill for over 45,000 Minnesotans, and that is another $38 million \nevery year that would stay with these working families.\n  The tax credit would have paid for nearly 4 years of tuition at the \nUniversity of Minnesota Twin Cities campus if the parents were able to \nbank the $500 per child tax credit for 18 years. Or the tax credit \ncould have saved average Minnesota families enough to buy 3 months of \ngroceries or make 1\\1/2\\ mortgage payments, or pay electric bills for \n11 months.\n  Mr. President, the people are calling on this Congress, this \nPresident, to balance the budget because they have heard those same old \nstatistics and it sounds pretty good to them. Of course, the other \ncomponent of our budget plan is our $245 billion package of tax relief, \nand there are real concerns outside Washington that it, the centerpiece \nof our budget, may be negotiated away.\n  I would like to show on the chart where we stand on tax relief \ncompared to spending and how much has already been negotiated away over \nthese last couple of months.\n  We started out spending $11.2 trillion. That has grown to the latest \nClinton budget of over $12.4 trillion. So spending has continued to \nincrease under these budget plans.\n  But at the same time, they continue to whittle away at the tax relief \nfor Americans. It started out at $354 billion of tax relief over 7 \nyears in the House plan to $245 billion under the Senate plan and now \nthe Clinton budget wants to cut this back to $78 billion, or even less.\n  So we can see over months of negotiations which way they are headed. \nIt is the same old scenario: More spending, but take it away from \ntaxpayers, and less tax relief.\n  I urge the budget negotiators to stand firm in their commitment to \nthe taxpayers of this Nation to let them keep more of the dollars that \nwe are routinely snatching out of their pockets. We need to stop \nWashington's nasty habit of taking money out of the checkbooks of \ntaxpayers and putting them into the checkbooks of politicians.\n  I remind my colleagues that $245 billion is a lot of money to the \ntaxpayers \n\n[[Page S19074]]\nwho finance this Government, who pick up the tab for wasteful and often \nextravagant schemes that Congress is too often eager to throw dollars \nat. Mr. President, $245 billion means a tax credit of $500 per child \nfor 55 million American families.\n\n  It means cutting the capital gains tax so that farmers and other \nfamily businesses are not so badly penalized when it comes time to pass \nalong their assets to another generation. It means eliminating the \nmarriage penalty and ending the discrimination against those who take \non the awesome responsibility of coming together as a family.\n  It means creating an adoption credit that will, hopefully, bring more \nchildren into loving and nurturing homes.\n  It means promoting savings by expanding individual retirement \naccounts.\n  While $245 billion is a huge sum of money, it is just a small, 1.5 \npercent, speck of the more than $12 trillion that Congress will spend \nover the next 7 years. Congress is not happy with 98.5 percent. They \nwant 100 percent. They do not want the taxpayers to have even that \nsmall amount.\n  Mr. President, if the Government is so addicted to spending that it \nwill not survive without that 1.5 percent, well, that is a pretty \nstrong commentary on the sorry state of things in Washington.\n  Despite the protests of the President and some of my colleagues who \nwill not give up a penny of the people's dollars without a fight, the \nGovernment will survive under our balanced budget plan. It will survive \nand the taxpayers will thrive. To be successful, this Congress, \nhowever, cannot give in.\n  Mr. President, there is a movie that has become very popular during \nthe holiday season. I believe it is so beloved because it shares a \nsimple, moving message about the power that each of us has to \nprofoundly influence our world.\n  ``It's a Wonderful Life'' is the name of this film. It was played on \ntelevision just last weekend, in fact, and I am certain that most all \nof my colleagues have watched it and take its message to heart.\n  It is about a good man, George Bailey, who reaches a difficult point \nin his life and begins to question his very existence.\n  With the help of his guardian angel, Clarence, George Bailey is given \nthe opportunity to see the difference he would have been able to make \nin the lives of family, friends, and his neighbors in Bedford Falls, \nand it was a revelation, because he did not realize how much he had \nchanged their lives forever.\n  Mr. President, we have an opportunity in 1995 to forever change the \nlives of each and every American by passing a balanced budget.\n  And we will not need a guardian angel to show us what we have \naccomplished, because 10 years from now, we will be able to see for \nourselves, everywhere we look, the result of our dedication to this \ndream: more jobs, higher salaries, cheaper loans that make homes, \nschooling, and transportation more affordable. A better, stronger \nAmerica for the future.\n  The next 2 weeks will tell the story.\n  Is 1995 going to mark the beginning of ``A Wonderful Life'' for \nAmerica's children and grandchildren? Or just another ``Nightmare on \nElm Street'' sequel?\n  Congress and the President have the power to decide, and I urge them \nto put that power to work on behalf of all Americans and enact a \nbalanced budget.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/12/21/senate-section/article/S19073-1", "month": "12", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "21", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S19074]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           ORDER OF PROCEDURE\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I submit a report of the committee of \nconference on H.R. 2539 and ask for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The report will be stated.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The committee on conference on the disagreeing votes of the \n     two Houses on the amendment of the Senate to the bill (H.R. \n     2539) to abolish the Interstate Commerce Commission, to amend \n     subtitle IV of title 49, United States Code, to reform \n     economic regulation of transportation, and for other \n     purposes, having met, after full and free conference, have \n     agreed to recommend and do recommend to their respective \n     Houses this report, signed by a majority of the conferees.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the Senate will proceed to \nthe consideration of the conference report.\n  (The conference report is printed in the House proceedings of the \nRecord of December 18, 1995.)\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to pass, S. 1396, \nthe Interstate Commerce Commission Sunset Act of 1995. This bill, \nreported out of the Commerce Committee by a unanimous vote, eliminates \nthe Interstate Commerce Commission [ICC], terminates numerous existing \nICC functions, and establishes an Intermodal Surface Transportation \nBoard to carry out the remaining rail and motor carrier regulatory \nfunctions.\n  With this bipartisan bill, the Congress will have completed the work \nbegun with the Motor Carrier Act of 1980, to free the surface \ntransportation industry from unnecessary and outmoded regulation, while \ncontinuing to protect shippers of all commodities and household goods \nfrom possible abuse by carriers. In addition, this bill sunsets the \nFederal Maritime Commission by January 1, 1997, and will move that \nagency's necessary functions to the new Board. Thus, the bill will \neliminate two Federal agencies, combining their remaining functions \ninto one Intermodal Board that is smaller than either of the former \nagencies.\n  The passage of this bill is of some urgency. The ICC will run out of \nmoney within a few weeks, and its elimination without an orderly \ntransition of its key functions is likely to disrupt affected \nindustries. The rail industry and household goods carriers, in \nparticular, want to ensure the continuity of the current regulatory \nscheme.\n  For the most part S. 1396 accomplishes the goal of orderly \ntransition. I note that a very similar bill, H.R. 2539, passed the \nHouse of Representatives by a vote of 417 to 8 late last week. I expect \nthat the differences between the two bills can be resolved quickly. S. \n1396 is a good bill. It is, as reflected in the committee vote, a \nbipartisan effort to develop a transportation oversight program that is \nappropriate to the 21st century. I urge, and hope my colleagues will \nsupport, its consideration and passage.\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, I rise to support this landmark conference \nreport to eliminate the Interstate Commerce Commission [ICC], and to \nreduce regulation on the transportation sector, and to transfer the \nresponsibilities of the Commission to a new independent Intermodal \nSurface Transportation Board [ITSB], and the U.S. Department of \nTransportation.\n  I am pleased to lend my enthusiastic support to this legislative \npackage of two bills to reform the Nation's transportation laws and to \nembrace the labor protection reforms endorsed by the House in the \nWhitfield amendment. If both are enacted, I expect this legislation to \nwin Presidential approval.\n  I support this conference report with only two reservations. To reach \nagreement, difficult, painful and significant compromises had to be \nmade. Two areas which continue to concern me are Carmack amendment \nreview and the transfer of the Federal Maritime Commission \nresponsibilities to the new board. While the conference report embraces \nsolutions to perceived problems in these issue areas. which are \ndifferent from both S. 1140 which I introduced earlier this year and \nthe Senate-passed bill; given the need to bargain, I believe that fair, \ndefensible compromises have been made.\n  Regarding the Carmack amendment, while I would have preferred the \nSenate provision to study the Carmack cargo liability system prior to \nenacting changes to current law, our House counterparts were firmly \nfixed in their \n\n[[Page S19075]]\nposition for dramatic and immediate reform. The compromise reached is \none which very closely follows the Carmack procedures in force when \ntariffs were filed with the ICC.\n  My second reservation concerns the decision of the conference to \ndelay consideration of transferring the responsibilities of the Federal \nMaritime Commission to the new board. The Senate bill embraced my \nvision of an intermodal agency which provided one-stop shopping for all \nsurface transportation. This action is, however, a vision delayed, not \ndenied. When the Senate debates reforms in the Ocean Shipping Act next \nyear, I will continue my push to transfer the responsibilities of the \nFMC to the new board. Notwithstanding these reservations and necessary \ncompromises, I do endorse and urge my colleagues to support this \nconference report.\n  This legislation builds on a bill I introduced earlier this year \nknown as the Transportation Streamlining Act. Following the \nintroduction of that act, Senator Pressler and I and our staff worked \nlong and hard to find broad areas of agreement and compromise. The work \nproduct of that negotiation is S. 1396. This conference report \nrepresents the latest chapter in a thoughtful and deliberate effort to \nreform and deregulate America's great transportation sector.\n\n  As one of the few Members of Congress with regular contact with \nAmerica's oldest independent regulatory agency, I again acknowledge the \ncommitment and hard work of the Commission and all of its employees. A \ngrateful Nation owes a debt of gratitude to these dedicated public \nservants for over a century of hard work. Their vigilance has made the \ncurrent transition to a more market-oriented transportation system \npossible.\n  One might ask, why there is a need for a successor agency to the ICC? \nSimply put, if there were no forum to resolve disputes, oversee \nstandard contract terms, establish national standards and assure fair \ntreatment for shippers and communities; the great, efficient and \nproductive transportation sector will spin into chaos. The failure to \nenact this legislation will produce just such chaos. Efficiency would \nbe replaced with litigation. Certainty would be replaced with buyer \nbeware. The result would be great harm to the notion of interstate \ncommerce.\n  The new ISTB within the Department of Transportation will continue to \nbe the fair referee between shippers, carriers, and communities. It \nwill provide interested parties with one-stop shopping and administer a \nsignificantly streamlined body of law which assures that the public \ninterest is protected in transportation policy.\n  This transfer of responsibility and streamlining of authority will \nreduce costs both to taxpayers and the private sector and assure that \nkey transportation safety responsibilities do not fall between the \ncracks.\n  Mr. President, our Nation takes for granted the blessings of \nAmerica's great transportation system. Every part of the Nation has \naccessible transportation service. As the Congress continues its \nefforts to keep regulation to the minimum necessary to protect the \npublic interest, let us not forget what a valuable asset we have and \nhow critically important it is that the Congress carefully choose the \ncorrect course.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote today to modernize America's \ntransportation policy and enact the pending conference report.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Mr. President, the Senate will now consider the \nconference report to H.R. 2539, the ICC Termination Act. The Senate-\npassed version of this legislation is S. 1396, the Interstate Commerce \nCommission Sunset Act of 1995, which I introduced on November 3, 1995. \nMy bill was adopted by unanimous consent in the Senate on November \n28th. Swift passage of this conference report is necessary to provide \nfor an orderly closure of our Nation's oldest regulatory agency.\n  As my colleagues know, this legislation was crafted in response to \nthe fiscal year 1996 budget resolution which assumes the elimination of \nthe Interstate Commerce Commission [ICC] and the fiscal year 1996 DOT \nappropriations bill, H.R. 2002, which provides no funding for the ICC \nafter December 31, 1995. This means that just over 1 week from now, the \nICC will close its doors forever. This conference agreement ensures the \nagency's sunset will be accomplished in a reasoned fashion and that \ncertain core and vital functions will continue.\n  The conference report authorizes the sunset of the ICC effective \nJanuary 1, 1996. It also eliminates scores of obsolete ICC regulatory \nfunctions. Finally, it transfers residual functions partly to a newly \nestablished independent Surface Transportation Board within the \nDepartment of Transportation and partly to the Secretary of \nTransportation.\n  Mr. President, this is historic legislation. The ICC is America's \noldest independent regulatory agency. It was established in 1887--108 \nyears ago. The ICC originally was created to protect shippers from the \nmonopoly power of the railroad industry. Throughout subsequent years, \nthe ICC's regulatory responsibilities were broadened and strengthened, \nand expanded to other modes. Today, the ICC has jurisdiction over the \nrail industry, certain pipelines, barge operators, bus lines, freight \nforwarders, household goods movers and some 60,000 ``for-hire'' motor \ncarriers.\n  During the past decade, a series of regulatory reform bills \nsignificantly deregulated the surface transportation industries, \nreducing the ICC's authority. Even with this considerable deregulation, \nhowever, the ICC continues to maintain a formidable regulatory \npresence. It determines policy through its rulemaking and adjudicative \nproceedings to ensure the effective administration of the Interstate \nCommerce Act, related statutes, and regulations. Clearly, the positive \nand necessary adjudicatory role of the ICC should not simply cease at \nthe end of the year. This legislation will ensure such limited core \nfunctions continue.\n  Mr. President, this conference report identifies which ICC functions \ncan and should continue to be performed by a successor. While that \npremise is the report's central theme, the agreement also takes into \naccount the fact that the new successor--a 3-member Surface \nTransportation Board--will have a very limited budget. Overall, it \nprovides a reasoned approach designed to ensure continued protections \nfor shippers against industry abuse--protections vitally important to \nshippers in places like my home State of South Dakota--while at the \nsame time, assure continued economic efficiencies in our Nation's \nsurface transportation system.\n  As with any conference report, this is the result of compromise on \nthe part of both the House and Senate. Throughout this process, \nhowever, I have been guided by the need to retain sufficient \nprotections for shippers while reducing unnecessary regulatory burdens \non our Nation's rail and trucking industries. This legislation meets \nthat objective.\n  Mr. President, Senator Dole received a communication yesterday \nafternoon from Secretary of Transportation Federico Pena and Secretary \nof Labor Robert Reich stating the President would veto this legislation \nif we did not adopt a provision supported by rail labor imposing \nmandatory labor protection on small railroad mergers. In my view, the \nClinton administration acted in an irresponsible fashion by threatening \nsignificant regulatory reform and protections for our shippers, farmers \nand ranchers.\n  A veto would create a regulatory black hole on January 1. Statutory \nand regulatory requirements would remain on the books, but no \nGovernment agency or official would be in place to administer them. \nThis legislation would maintain critical functions affecting the rail \nand trucking industries that protect small shippers and others from \nmarket abuse. A veto would be in complete disregard of the needs of \nfarmers and small agricultural shippers who rely on adequate \ntransportation service provided by these surface transportation \nindustries.\n  Therefore, with extreme reluctance we agreed to the administration's \ndemand to modify the legislation to meet the completely unfounded \nconcerns of rail labor. Thus, the conference report to H.R. 2539 is \naccompanied by a concurrent resolution which strips the class II/class \nIII railroad merger provision agreed to in conference that created an \noption to merge such railroads under current law. The administration \ninsisted we use language from the House-passed bill requiring that \nclass \n\n[[Page S19076]]\nII/III mergers proceed only under a special new rule which lowers labor \nprotection from 6 years to 1 year, but which states collective \nbargaining agreements may not be avoided by allowing a shifting of work \nfrom a union carrier to a nonunion carrier.\n  In my view, the language in the House-passed bill is drafted in such \na way as to potentially create serious questions. Therefore, I can \nassure my colleagues we will be revisiting this issue in the next \nsession of Congress. The language is designed to prevent a carrier from \nshifting work from unionized workers to nonunionized workers to avoid \ncontracts as a part of a merger implementation.\n  My point is the Board established in this legislation must use the \npreemption provisions of the legislation to review how laws should be \naccommodated to enable these mergers to occur in a timely fashion and \nin a way that best serves the public interest in continued and \neffective rail transportation. This revised section is not intended to \ncreate a special rule of law that allows labor unions to delay or veto \nmergers between class II and class III railroads. After all, they do \nnot have such power in any other segment of American industry.\n  The provisions of this bill must be read in totality. Again, Mr. \nPresident, I want my colleagues and the new Board to understand this \nchange to the conference report is not intended to give rail labor a \nveto over the transportation needs of communities and shippers who \nwould benefit by a merger between class II and class III railroads.\n  Mr. President, on balance this conference report is the result of \nnearly a year's worth of bipartisan study, discussion and work. It \nrepresents a reasonable compromise. I want to thank the conferees, \ntheir staffs and the staff of the Commerce Committee for all their \ndedicated work and long hours in producing this final legislative \npackage. The legislation before us will eliminate a host of outdated \nand unnecessary laws while ensuring continued protection for America's \nshippers. I urge its adoption.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nconference report be agreed to and that the motion to reconsider be \nlaid upon the table.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  So the conference report was agreed to.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/12/21/senate-section/article/S19074-2", "month": "12", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "21", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S19076-S19077]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n     DIRECTING THE CLERK OF THE HOUSE TO MAKE TECHNICAL CHANGES IN \n                        ENROLLMENT OF H.R. 2539\n\n  Mr. CHAFEE. I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to the \nconsideration of Senate Concurrent Resolution. 37, submitted earlier \ntoday by Senator Exon.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will state the concurrent resolution by title.\n  The bill clerk read a follows:\n\n       A concurrent resolution (S. Con. Res. 37) directing the \n     Clerk of the House of Representatives to make technical \n     changes in the enrollment of the bill (H.R. 2539) entitled \n     ``An Act to abolish the Interstate Commerce Commission, to \n     amend subtitle IV of title 49, United States Code, to reform \n     economic regulation of transportation, and for other \n     purposes.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the immediate \nconsideration of the concurrent resolution?\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nconcurrent resolution.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I have been involved in intense \nnegotiations over the course of the last few days to try to resolve a \nmajor problem with the conference report on HR 2539, the Interstate \nCommerce Termination Act of 1995. We have now resolved that problem, \nthrough an agreement to make a key change in the conference report \nwhich is designed to protect the collective bargaining agreements of \nrailroad employees. With that change, I have agreed to allow the \nconference report to go through without extended debate that could slow \nit down and put at risk its final enactment. Since we are in the final \ndays of this session, and I know it is urgent that ICC legislation be \nenacted to ensure continued consumer protections for all Americans, I \nam delighted that this change has now been agreed to, and I am grateful \nfor the help and support of Senators Exon, Kennedy, Harkin, Kerry, \nSimon and others in this effort.\n  The change will be made through adoption of Senate Concurrent \nResolution 37, submitted earlier today by Senator Exon and myself, \nwhich is to be taken up and agreed to concurrently with the conference \nreport by unanimous consent. I am hopeful that both will also be taken \nup and agreed to by the House later tonight or tomorrow. I understand \nthere are preliminary indications from the House Republican leadership, \nafter fierce and sustained resistance that has lasted for months, that \nthey are finally willing to make this change in order to help avoid a \nPresidential veto.\n  The concurrent resolution would restore labor protections provided \nfor in the Senate bill that were dropped in the House-Senate \nconference. Without this change, the conference report would be \nstrongly opposed by representatives of railroad employees nationwide \nbecause it would significantly reduce existing rights of workers \nemployed by small- and medium-sized railroads. In fact, that is also \none key reason why the administration has indicated its intent to veto \nthis measure. I hope that if this change is made by the House, the \nadministration would take another look at this legislation, and its \ndecision to veto the bill announced yesterday.\n  Let me briefly describe how we came to this point. At various points \nin this legislative process, employees were forced to give up labor \nprotections on line sales to noncarriers, give up mandatory labor \nprotections on line sales to class III carriers, agree to reduced labor \nprotections on line sales to class II carriers, give up mandatory labor \nprotections on mergers between class III carriers, and agree to reduced \nlabor protections on mergers between class II and class III carriers.\n  All these concessions were made by employees in return for the right \nthat every other American worker has--to bargain collectively with \ntheir employers and have those collectively bargained agreements \nenforced in court. Employees asked for just one exception to the \ncurrent ``cram-down'' practice of the ICC, which allows abrogation of \ncollective bargaining agreements under certain circumstances.\n  This may seem somewhat technical, but it is profoundly important to \nthe lives and livelihoods of thousands of rail workers in my State and \nthroughout the Nation. For mergers between class II and class III \nrailroads, likely to become increasingly common over the next decade, \nrailroad employees requested a provision contained in the so-called \n``Whitfield Amendment'' adopted on the House floor by a vote of 241-\n184, to require that a merger could not be used to avoid a collective \nbargaining agreement, or to shift work from a union to a nonunion \ncarrier.\n  But unlike the House and Senate-passed bills, the conference \nagreement does not provide such protection. Instead, it gives the \ncarrier applying for the merger a choice of whether to preserve \ncollective bargaining agreements or to abrogate them unilaterally \nthrough the successor to the ICC. The concurrent resolution will fix \nthis problem by effectively restoring the language of the Whitfield \nAmendment, which prohibits abrogation of such agreements. I am pleased \nwe reached agreement on this key change.\n  At the same time, I understand why the administration has \nreservations about the conference report. Although I support much of \nit, which streamlines the Federal Government while maintaining a fair \nand responsible Federal regulatory structure, this final version is not \nperfect, and there are parts which I oppose. For example, I am \nconcerned about a provision that changes the regulation of household \ngoods shipping. I supported the Senate version which would have ensured \nno Federal preemption of State laws relating to the shipment of \nhousehold goods. Unfortunately, conferees chose to include the House \nlanguage that would allow Federal preemption of State laws relating to \nshipping these goods.\n  I am concerned about this Federal preemption of State laws, because \nconsumers deserve continued State protections when shipping their \nbelongings to a new home. I intend to monitor the implementation of \nthis provision carefully, and if it poses serious problems, as I expect \nit will, to try again to address these problems next year.\n\n[[Page S19077]]\n\n  But my overriding concern has been the fate of thousands of railroad \nemployees across the Nation who could have been harmed under its \nprovisions, and that is why we wanted to try to address this problem \nbefore it passed the Senate. I am delighted that this has now been \ndone, and I am hopeful that the House will act on it immediately to \nensure abroad, comprehensive labor protections for railroad workers. I \nwant to go again thank Senator Exon for his help with this problem.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. I ask unanimous consent that the concurrent resolution be \nagreed to, the motion to reconsider be laid upon the table, that any \nstatements relating to the conference report or the concurrent \nresolution appear at the appropriate place in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  So the concurrent resolution (S. Con. Res. 37) was agreed to, as \nfollows:\n\n                            S. Con.

First of all, I thank the Senator from Nevada for \npermitting us to go ahead of him. That was very gracious.\n  This morning, a bipartisan group of Senators--19 in all--unveiled a \nplan to balance the budget by the year 2002, using CBO, Congressional \nBudget Office, numbers. The group, which Senator Breaux and I had \nconvened several weeks ago--actually, we had our first meeting in \nOctober--includes, as I say, so far, 19 Senators. That is without going \nout and seeking new Members. It is just those who have come to us and \nwant to join in this effort.\n  We are all united in this belief, Mr. President: It is absolutely \nessential that this Nation have a balanced budget by the year 2002, and \nthat it will be impossible to achieve that budget unless those on both \nsides of the aisle are prepared to compromise. This is the essence of \nthe effort of this group of Republicans and Democrats who are getting \ntogether for a common objective.\n  The Senate bipartisan balanced budget plan is a huge step forward on \nthe path to this budget agreement. It represents, I might say, Mr. \nPresident, the first truly bipartisan proposal to balance the budget. \nThere are other groups in the House that are working, but they do not \ninclude Members of both sides. It was made possible, this agreement, \nonly because both sides were willing to compromise on some very \nstrongly held beliefs. We did this for the good of this country of \nours. This is especially true with the compromising aspects with \nrespect to the issues of Medicare and tax cuts. I am grateful to the \nDemocrats in our group for their willingness to go with the CBO \nnumbers. They agreed to that before it became accepted by the White \nHouse. This was a big step for the Democratic Members of our group.\n  Now, undoubtedly, this plan will cause consternation on the \nDemocratic side with number, and on the Republican side with some. But \nwe are committed to reaching this balanced budget, free of gimmickry, \nand we are doing it for the welfare of future generations, for our \nchildren and our grandchildren.\n  To those who disagree with our numbers, let me say this, Mr. \nPresident, and to those who think they can do a better job: Go to it. \nWe welcome their efforts. All I ask is they do it with a bipartisan \ngroup, not just one group from one side and one group from the other. \nSure, we can come out on the Republican side with a massive tax cut and \ntremendous slashes in Medicare, for example. But try that on the \nDemocratic side and see how it goes. So the essence of this was that we \nhad Members from both sides.\n\n  Mr. President, this plan is intended to demonstrate to the \nnegotiators on both sides that, one, it is essential to compromise and, \ntwo, that it can be done. It is a doable task. No one should throw up \ntheir hands in despair and say the sides are too far apart.\n  What did we do? There were significant steps taken to control the \ngrowth of Medicare and other entitlements. Our plan calls for Medicare \nsavings of $154 billion, with a strong commitment from everybody in the \ngroup that the part B premiums stay at 31.5 percent, with affluence \ntesting for those above the regular brackets, and also means testing \nfor those who are in the lower-income areas--and they might well \nqualify for paying less than 31.5 percent.\n  We have agreed to conform the retirement age for Medicare with that \nof Social Security--namely, age 67. This is something that is going to \ntake place in the future and will not contribute any dollars to the 7-\nyear plan. But we feel it is critical to include this needed long-term \nentitlement reform.\n  On Medicaid, we have savings of $67 billion. Underlying this number \nis a view that we should preserve the Federal entitlement for our most \nvulnerable citizens, while, at the same time, we provided the States \nwith broad flexibility to administer the program. This is, again, not \ngoing to make everybody happy, but it was something that we all agreed \nto.\n  We have agreed to $130 billion in tax cuts. We did not delineate how \nthe tax cuts would be. We left that to the negotiators. We did not say \nX amount for capital gains cuts or Y amount for a child tax credit. We \nhave chosen to reduce the CPI, Consumer Price Index, by .5 percent, \nwhich gives us $110 billion in additional savings.\n  Frankly, we did this because we have had all kinds of testimony \nbefore the Finance Committee, which stated that the present CPI is a \nflawed measurement and should be adjusted actually beyond the .5 \npercent. It should be as high as .7 percent, or indeed some economists \nsay as high as 2 percent. We also included $58 billion in savings under \nwelfare, which assumes the Senate-passed welfare reform bill. On \ndiscretionary reductions, we came in slightly below the so-called hard \nfreeze--namely, no increase for inflation over the 7-year period.\n  Finally, Mr. President, we support the immediate adoption of a clean \ncontinuing resolution, on a short-term basis, until sometime next week, \nto get people back to work and get these budget negotiations back on \ntrack.\n  Mr. President, this is not a perfect plan, and it is not offered in \nthe sense that we are budget negotiators. It is an illustration that a \nresponsible balanced budget agreement using CBO numbers is doable. I \nhope it will help our negotiators as they go about the difficult task \nof securing a final budget accord.\n  Mr. President, I am delighted to be joined here on the floor with the \ndistinguished Senator from Louisiana, who was absolutely crucial in all \nthese negotiations that we had.\n  I yield the floor to him.\n  Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, at a time when most Americans believe that \nmany Members of Congress ruined this Christmas season, and are probably \non the verge of killing each other because we have not been able to \nagree on the principles and even how to keep the Government open, I \nwant to say what a great privilege and pleasure it is to be able to \nwork with the senior Senator from the State of Rhode Island. His \nwisdom, his experience, his knowledge, his compassion for people, and \nyet his dedication to making Government work really is a pleasure to \nme, as a Democratic Member on this side of the aisle, to be able to \nwork with a person of great common sense and great compassion and just \ncommon sense that understands that in order to make Government work \nthere is such a thing as the art of compromise. That makes sense.\n  I think we have gotten to a point in this Congress where the word \ncompromise is almost a dirty word that you should never utter for fear \nof moving away from the party principles. All of us who have been here \nlonger than 12 months have to understand the way to get things done is \nto put forth the best ideas from both sides of the aisle and recognize \nthat on difficult issues that those principles that we stand for need \nnot be compromised, but how to get to those goals in fact does \nnecessitate \n\n[[Page S19078]]\ncompromise if we are ever going to make Government work.\n  Unfortunately, there are some who do not want to make Government work \nwho have been elected to the Congress who are more concerned with \nshutting it down in order to make a point than in being willing to \nnegotiate and talk with the other side and compromise with the other \nside in an effort to reach a legitimate compromise.\n  I think there is enough blame to go around. This is not a partisan \nstatement at all. In fact, it is the opposite. I think both sides have \nhad various Members at various times stake out lines in the sand and \nsay we will not go any further than this, but there is a consequence to \nthose type of speeches. The consequence is that the American people are \nshouting. They are not whispering any longer. They are shouting, \n``Enough is enough. We have sent all of you here, Democrats and \nRepublicans, to make Government work, not to shut it down, not to close \nthe doors on the services that people need, not to make political \npoints.''\n  That is what elections are about. After you are here, it is about \nservice, and after you are here it is about making Government work for \nthe people that elected us. We are at a point now where we are, both \nsides, losing the faith of the American people to do exactly what we \nare supposed to be doing.\n\n  That is why the press conference that we had this morning, Senator \nChafee and myself, accompanied by about 19 Members, 18, 19, 20--half \nand half; half Democrats and half Republicans--who stood up and said, \nwe have heard the pleas of the American people to get the job done. We \nhave heard the pleas of our constituents who have said ``Stop the \nmadness. Make Government work again. Trust us to accept your judgment \nwhen you reach a compromise,'' and we presented that plan. It is a \nblueprint. It is an outline. It has specific numbers on how to reach a \nbalanced budget in 7 years, scored by the CBO in a way that is not \neverything that both sides would want, but I think reflects a fair \nmiddle ground.\n  We have called for a continuing resolution. This is a bipartisan \ngroup that says we should continue the Government so we can have the \nnegotiators work without the pressure of having the Government shut \ndown. This is Republicans and Democrats saying, at the same time, and \nin the same forum, we need a simple continuing resolution, uncluttered, \ngive us until January 15th so the negotiators can work in peace and do \nthe job that they are supposed to do. A very important point, the first \ntime that a bipartisan group has said that.\n  Second, this group has called for tax cuts. These tax cuts are \nsmaller than many Republicans would like but at the same time these tax \ncuts are larger than many Democrats would like. But it is a tax cut, a \nsignificant tax cut, which is designed to increase growth and \nproductivity and savings in this country.\n  The second thing we do is we say there will have to be more cuts in \nentitlement programs--propose less cuts than Republicans would like and \ncertainly more cuts than Democrats would like. But we are recommending \nthat there be entitlement cuts to these programs to restore their \nsolvency, to assure they will be around for the next generation, \nrecognizing that to do that we have to have some significant reforms.\n  Mr. President, what we have offered is a blueprint. Part of that \nblueprint is something that some people think is so horribly \ncontroversial that we cannot even utter the word except in closeted \nsurroundings, and that is an adjustment in the Consumer Price Index. \nEvery economic expert, the people that read numbers every day and wear \nthe green eyeshades and look at how much it costs to buy a typical \nbasket of groceries, have told the Congress that we overestimate the \nConsumer Price Index, and taxes are indexed to that. Entitlement \nincreases are indexed to that. But the index needs to be adjusted.\n  You would think that that is not too difficult a thing to do. But our \nside does not want to go first because people will say it is a tax \nincrease or a cut in entitlement programs. Republicans do not want to \ngo first because of the same reason. So as a result, nothing gets done. \nOur side stood up today in a public forum and said yes, we think it \nought to be fixed. It is broken. The suggestion is that there be a .5 \npercent adjustment in the Consumer Price Index, which will generate \nabout $110 billion over the next 7 years that we can use for programs \nthat need greater funding, that will meet the needs of the people of \nthis country.\n  I will conclude by saying this: Mr. Chafee has offered some real \nleadership here, and the other Republicans who have joined him have \nsaid, yes, it is time to recognize that compromise is all the way out. \nSo we call for a truce today. We called for a ``stop the shouting and \nstop the blame game'' today. It was a significant statement. The \nproduct that we have put on the table, I think, is one that makes \nsense. It may not be the final answer, but it certainly offers a \nblueprint for us to get out of the mess that we are in.\n  We would hope that our colleagues will take a look at the product. I \nhope the negotiators will consider it as we present it to them this \nafternoon. I think the negotiations are going well. And hopefully, with \na continuing resolution, they will have adequate time to get the job \ndone. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I want to thank the distinguished Senator \nfrom Louisiana for the kind comments. It was a joint leadership. He was \nkind enough to say it was my leadership. No, no, it was the joint \nleadership in which we shared the responsibilities and the effort \ntogether, Senator Breaux and I, and we certainly had wonderful support \nfrom everybody involved.\n  Mr. President, the agreement that we submitted today in the press \nconference and have outlined here on the floor was remarkable for this \nfact: Everybody agreed on every point. Now, that does not mean we \nstarted that way, but when we finished people did not say, ``Well, I am \nfor points 1 through 4 but include me out on points 5, 6 and 7. But I \nam there for points 8, 9, and 10.'' Everybody signed on for all of the \npoints. That was tough. It was tough for the Democrats to go to the \n$140,000 tax cut; it was tough for the Republicans to agree on the \nMedicare cut. We think we could have done better on the Medicare cut. \nWe do not use the word ``cut''; ``reduction in the rate of increase.''\n  In order to reach an agreement we all compromised. I think it was a \nwonderful effort, and along with the Senator from Louisiana, I commend \nit to our colleagues and hope they take a good look at it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order the Senator from \nNevada is now recognized.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Will the Senator from Nevada yield to me for just 2 \nminutes?\n  Mr. REID. As soon as I yield to the Senator from West Virginia for \nwhatever time he may consume, as long as I do not lose my right to the \nfloor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I thank the Senator for his characteristic \ncourtesy. I will be brief.\n  Mr. President, today Senator Robert Dole equals the record set by \nCharles McNary, of Oregon, as the longest serving Republican floor \nleader. Senator McNary served as floor leader for 10 years, 11 months, \nand 18 days, until his death on February 25, 1944.\n  Senator Dole, who began his service as leader on January 3, 1985, \nwill have served 10 years, 11 months, and 18 days, as of the close of \nbusiness today. That is quite a record. Tomorrow, the Lord willing, \nSenator Dole will break the all-time record for the longest serving \nRepublican floor leader.\n  I have been majority leader, minority leader, and majority leader \nagain. I know something about the burdens that a leader carries. It is \na thankless task. All of his colleagues think that they can do a better \njob than he can do as leader, or at least I kind of had that feeling \nwhen I was leader. And it is a heavy responsibility.\n  Senator Dole has served his country on the far-flung battlefields, he \nhas sacrificed for his country on foreign battlefields, and he has \nserved his country on the legislative battlefield. I salute him and \ncommend him.\n  He broke Everett Dirksen's record as second longest serving \nRepublican floor \n\n[[Page S19079]]\nleader on September 4 of this year. I served here when the late Everett \nDirksen graced this Chamber, serving at that desk where Senator Dole \nnow serves as majority leader. And I also served with Howard Baker, who \nwas Everett Dirksen's son-in-law. Dirksen served 10 years and 8 months, \nextending from January 7, 1959, to September 7, 1969.\n  So, I salute Bob Dole and I wish him many, many happy returns on this \nday. It is not his birthday, but he equals the record of the longest \nserving Republican leader. I look forward to tomorrow, when he will \nbreak that record.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a list of all the \nRepublican floor leaders with their dates and length of service be \nprinted in the Record at this point.\n  There being no objection, the list was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                        REPUBLICAN FLOOR LEADERS                        \n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n        Length of service                Name          Service as leader\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n10 years, 11 mos., 18 days......

I thank my friend from Nevada, Senator Reid, for his \nkindness and courtesy in yielding.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, before my friend, the distinguished senior \nSenator from West Virginia leaves the floor, I join in commending the \nmajority leader for his service.\n  But I was thinking, as the distinguished Senator was speaking, that \nRobert Dole has been Republican floor leader longer than I have been in \nthe Senate, a year longer than I have been in the Senate. If there were \never an illustration of why the term limit argument is so worthless, we \nneed only look at the distinguished services rendered by Senator Robert \nDole.\n  Those people who are still beating the drums--the unconstitutional \ndrums, I might add--of term limits are people who do not recognize that \nbeing a great leader does not come overnight. Even though I do not \nalways agree with the majority leader I have always found him to be \nfair, deliberate, and really statesmanlike in the things that he does \nin the Senate. That did not come by accident. He, as has been outlined \nby the Senator from West Virginia, has served not only in the military \nbut in this body for many years. And the only thing term limits would \ndo is increase the power of bureaucrats, those nameless, faceless \npeople that do not answer phones, who we continually hear complaints \nabout. It would also greatly increase the power of the lobbyists who \nfill these hallways of the U.S. Senate, and, of course, it would also \nincrease the power of congressional staff and weaken the ability of the \nAmerican public to be served well.\n  So, I commend and applaud the Senator from West Virginia for \nrecognizing the great services of the Senator from Kansas, service that \nwill go down in the history books. And also my editorial comment, that \nterm limits are a bad idea today, tomorrow, and any other time.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Will the Senator yield for just a moment?\n  Mr. REID. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, if I might just make an observation, I was \nstruck by the comments offered by the Senator from West Virginia and by \nthe Senator from Nevada. I have had exactly the same thoughts, \nespecially in recent days when we have seen, sometimes, behavior that \nseems intemperate and behavior that does not always do this institution \nproud, to recall there are people who have served many, many years in \nthis institution, whose knowledge, whose understanding, and whose \nwisdom serves this country well.\n  With respect to Senator Dole, I have said before on the Senate floor \nand I will say again today, while I do not always agree with him--in \nfact, sometimes we have very vigorous debate about policy--I have \nenormous respect for his capabilities, and I have enormous respect for \nhis service to this country as a U.S. Senator.\n  It seems to me that this country has been well served for many, many \ndecades by service from people with names like Webster and Calhoun and \nClay, and so many others, and in this century, Goldwater and Humphrey, \nand so many others, including Senator Robert C. Byrd. And it especially \nincludes Senator Robert Dole.\n  I think almost all of us in this Chamber, no matter where we come \nfrom or what our political philosophy is, respect the leadership and \nthe service offered this country by the distinguished majority leader.\n  I appreciate very much hearing the comments, the generous and \nappropriate comments offered today about Senator Dole, by the Senator \nfrom West Virginia. And I appreciate the Senator from Nevada yielding \nto me.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Will the Senator from Nevada yield as well?\n  Mr. REID. I am happy to yield to the Democratic leader.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I appreciate, again, the Senator yielding \nthe time. I know the Senator from Nevada did not come to the floor to \ntalk specifically about this issue, but I want to commend the \ndistinguished Senator from West Virginia for calling to the attention \nof the Senate this important day. I think it is obvious, from many of \nthe comments made by Members on this side of the aisle, the respect and \nthe extraordinary degree of real friendship that we have for the \nmajority leader. As many have also indicated, there are many, many \noccasions when we find ourselves in disagreement, but never, hopefully, \nto be disagreeable.\n  Our view is that we have been led well by this majority leader and, \nobviously, in the tradition of the majority leadership of the Senator \nfrom West Virginia, Senator Dole has served us very ably. He is a \nperson who wants to get things done. He is a person who recognizes the \nphilosophical differences, the partisan differences that we hold. But \nhe is also a person I have found to be immensely helpful and supportive \nin my new role as the Democratic leader.\n  I have had the good fortune to work with many people on both sides of \nthe aisle since coming to the Senate, but I know of no one on the \nRepublican side of the aisle with whom I have enjoyed working more and \nfor whom I have greater respect. So it is important that on this \nspecial day we call attention to his service and to the great affection \nin which he is held by so many Members on this side of the aisle.\n  I share my congratulations with the Senator from West Virginia, the \nSenator from North Dakota, and the Senator from Nevada, in expressing \nour best wishes to him as we mark this special occasion.\n  I yield the floor, and I thank the Senator for yielding.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from \nNorth Dakota is recognized.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I believe that order should be that the \nSenator from Nevada had the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator yielded 2 minutes under a previous \norder.\n  So I recognize the Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. My understanding is that the Senator from North Dakota \nwished the floor. I would be happy to yield the floor for whatever time \nthe Senator may take and I still maintain my right to the floor.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Nevada for his \nvery generous willingness to give me some time.\n  First, on the matter of the majority leader, I want to join my \ncolleagues in recognizing his service as a leader in the U.S. Senate. \nHis period of time as leader, I understand, has extended over 10 years. \nThat is longer than I have served in the U.S. Senate. I, too, admire \nthe Senator from Kansas. I have found that he is somebody who commands \nrespect. He does his homework. He leads his side of the aisle in a very \nvigorous and determined way. While there are many times that we \ndisagree on a policy issue, I have never thought that he is someone who \ncommands anything other than full respect. And I want to add my voice \nto the voices of others. \n\n[[Page S19080]]\n\n  Frankly, I think we could use a good bit more of that around here, \nrecognizing the worth of people on both sides, because I have found \nthat colleagues on both sides of the aisle in this Chamber are some of \nthe finest people I have ever known. Just because we have differences \nand we debate vigorously does not diminish the value nor the humanity \nof anyone on either side. Maybe that is a word that needs to go out \nfrom this Chamber more; that people who serve here are worthy, and they \nare good people.\n  In fact, I think my constituents sometimes are surprised when I tell \nthem that I find, on both sides of the aisle, the people that I serve \nwith are some of the finest people I have ever known, the people who \nare in the U.S. Senate.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/12/21/senate-section/article/S19078-1", "month": "12", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "21", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S19080]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          THE LEADERSHIP OF SENATOR CHAFEE AND SENATOR BREAUX\n\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I would like for just a moment to single \nout two of my colleagues who, I think, are showing real leadership at a \ntime of gridlock in Washington. I want to single out Senator Chafee, \nthe Senator from Rhode Island, and Senator Breaux, the Senator from \nLouisiana, who have led our bipartisan effort to put together a budget \nplan that would merge the differences, that would find common ground, \nthat would break the gridlock, and that demonstrates that the two sides \ncan work together here to achieve a result that is important for the \ncountry.\n  Mr. President, earlier today we were able to hold a news conference \nand indicate that last night we reached agreement between 19 Senators--\n10 Republicans and 9 Democrats--on the outlines of a plan to balance \nthe budget on a unified basis over 7 years using CBO scoring, and that \nwe were able to do it in a way that is fair and balanced.\n  Mr. President, I must say I have been very proud to participate in \nthis effort because we did it without raised voices, we did it without \nhurling brick bats across the barricades, we did it by sitting \ntogether, by reasoning together, and by working together to achieve a \nresult that is important to the country.\n  I think the leadership of Senator Chafee and Senator Breaux should \nserve as an example to others who are negotiating on this budget matter \nbecause I think our group has blazed the trail showing others how we \ncould achieve a result that will get the Government back to working and \nbreak the gridlock.\n  Mr. President, every day in this town there is a news conference that \nputs a spotlight on the differences between the two parties. This was \nthe first news conference in many days in this city in which we were \nnot talking about differences but we were talking about the ability of \npeople of good will on both sides to get together, to reason together, \nand to achieve a breakthrough.\n  Mr. President, we just had an opportunity to make a presentation on \nthat plan to the negotiators from both sides. I was pleased by the \nreaction.\n  I am just hopeful now that in the hours ahead cooler heads will \nprevail and that both sides will understand that to achieve an \nagreement neither side can get precisely what it wants but that we can \nhave a principled compromise and one that advances the interests of \nthis Nation.\n  Mr. President, I want to end as I began by saluting the leadership of \nSenator Chafee and Senator Breaux. It takes courage to compromise.\n  Mr. President, as in the words of the ``Liberty Song'' by John \nDickenson, ``By uniting we stand, by dividing we fall.''\n  This is an example of Senators working together to unite, of Senators \nreasoning together to unite, and I hope our colleagues will begin to \nfocus on the need for uniting. That is what has made America strong--\npulling together, working together, and uniting in order to achieve a \nresult.\n  I thank the Chair. I yield the floor.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada has the floor.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, will the Senator allow me 30 seconds on \nthe subject of Bob Dole?\n  Mr. REID. I am happy to yield without losing my right to the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/12/21/senate-section/article/S19080-1", "month": "12", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "21", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S19080]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            SENATOR BOB DOLE\n\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. With great precision and with equal interest, Mr. \nPresident, it has been a quarter of a century since I first knew Bob \nDole and worked with him. He would find it interesting that we began \nworking in an effort with a Republican President to establish a \nguaranteed income as a way of getting us out of our welfare problems. \nWe are still in them. We will be in them much of the evening.\n  But in 25 years I have not known a man I have respected more. I have \nnot worked with anyone with greater consequence. He is an ornament to \nthis institution and to this Nation. We are proud of him.\n  I thank the Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, we have heard some talk on the floor today \nabout we should have a balanced budget within 7 years. I would \ncertainly acknowledge that. But I think the thing we should be \nconcerned about today is getting Government back to work.\n  There have been statements made by the Republican leadership that \nthose 250,000 Federal employees who are on furlough will be paid. Well, \nif they are going to be paid, it seems logical to me that the taxpayers \nwould be getting a much better deal if they were doing something for \ntheir pay, like maybe doing their job.\n  I would suggest that just sheer logic tells me that, if the \nRepublican leadership said that the furloughed employees are going to \nbe paid their wages for not working, that we should go the next step \nand allow them to work so that the taxpayers are getting their money's \nworth. This way they are getting a real bad deal. The taxpayers are \ntold that the parks are going to be closed. There are various Federal \nagencies where 250,000 people work and are not going to be operable but \nthe people are going to be paid anyway. If I were a taxpayer, I would \nsay that does not sound like a real good deal for me.\n  So I say for the third time here in the last few minutes, if the \nRepublican leadership has said they will pay the furloughed workers, it \nseems to me logical that we should get them all back to work.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Will the Senator yield on that point?\n  Mr. REID. I am happy to yield for a question.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I would like to ask the Senator a question \nabout that because I feel much as he does--that somehow, sometime \ntoday, or immediately, if possible, we ought to have the Federal \nworkers come back to work and end the shutdown and still continue to \nnegotiate on a balanced budget agreement.\n  It does not make any sense to see a circumstance where Federal \nworkers--some 300,000--will not be allowed to come to work but will \nstill be paid for work they did not do. And the bill is going to be \npaid by the American taxpayer.\n  I ask the Senator from Nevada, is not this a period several days \nbefore Christmas where it is for most a magic time, a time of family, \nreflection, lights, music, worship, and now we have a circumstance \nwhere we have 1 million checks that have been written sitting in a \nwarehouse here in Washington, DC, that are supposed to go out to the \nveterans and are supposed to be in their mailboxes on January 1 for \nveterans and survivors? Unless a continuing resolution is passed \nimmediately, that is not going to happen. We have 4 million children \nwhose AFDC payments for their daily needs relates to the question of \nwhether the continuing resolution will be passed so the money and the \nresources will be available for them.\n  You can imagine what will happen if on January 2 or 3 a veteran's \nsurvivor expecting a check needing to pay the rent or to buy food or to \nprovide for their children's needs discovers the check is not there \nbecause of this shutdown. That is why I hope somehow this evening all \nof this gets unlocked and we can pass a CR. Does the Senator from \nNevada see any reason that it provides any leverage for anyone to \ncontinue to have a Government shutdown in which people are sent home, \n\n[[Page S19081]]\nsome 300,000, but yet we pay them for work they did not do? Is there \nanybody that gets penalized other than the American taxpayer with this \nkind of strategy?\n  Mr. REID. I would say to my friend from North Dakota, they are being \npenalized, the taxpayers that is, to the tune of $40 million a day. \nThat is my understanding of the wages that are going to be paid for not \ndoing the work. So you multiply just a little bit the time they have \nalready been out of work--this is counted on Saturdays and Sundays. \nThey get paid no matter what day it is--2 days, 80, 120, 160. It gets \nup pretty quickly.\n  That is where we are now. And the American taxpayer gets nothing in \nthe way of services. We have here in Washington now one of the finest \nart exhibits to have been here in decades, the greatest still lifes \nprobably ever painted, but it is only going to be here a short time and \npeople have come from all over the United States to see that. They \ncannot see it. But yet those people who should be working are not \nworking but are being paid, and the taxpayer gets a real bad deal on \nthat.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Will the Senator yield for an observation?\n  Mr. REID. I would be happy to yield to my friend without losing my \nright to the floor.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. It has been mentioned once or twice, but I do not think \nthe full impact of the shutdown of the Government has really been \naccurately described. If you were one of the 260,000 people sitting \nhome and being paid for nothing, first of all, that is demeaning, to \nordinary people. They would much rather be working, despite the fact \nthey are sitting home and being paid to sit home. But the dimension \nthat I am going to mention is here is the most joyous season of the \nyear, Christmas, that everybody looks forward to and among the 260,000 \nworkers at home, I promise you, a lot of them live from paycheck to \npaycheck, and a lot of them were depending on spending money for gifts \nfor their children for Christmas. And you know, sometimes I think the \nCongress ought to be charged with child abuse because a lot of children \nare not going to have the Christmas they otherwise would have.\n  I am not saying this is going to be massive, but obviously a lot of \npeople are affected by the fact that they do not have a paycheck and \ntherefore cannot spend any money unless they have a credit card that \nhas a little bit left on the limit. But it is one of the most \nunfathomable things--I have been here 21 years. This is the most \nirresponsible, unfathomable, irrational things I have ever seen in my \n21 years here. What on Earth are we doing?\n  Mr. REID. I would say to my friend from Arkansas, I repeat, \nespecially when the Republican leadership has said these 250,000 or \n260,000 people are going to be paid anyway. So would not the next step \nbe to say, OK, you are going to get paid; go to work?\n  Mr. BUMPERS. It is an interesting thing about how we are cutting \neverybody under the shining Sun in the interest of a balanced budget \nbut willing in the interest of some kind of unfathomable, absolutely \nincomprehensible to me ideology that says you cannot keep the \nGovernment going and talk about balancing the budget at the same time. \nIt is a nondebate about whether we are going to balance the budget or \nnot. That is a no-brainer. Everybody agrees on that point.\n  What we are arguing about mostly is the tax cut. If the Republicans \nwould forgo all or just a significant portion of the tax cut, this is a \ndone deal. Everybody knows that we have to cut Medicare. Everybody \nknows that we are going to have to slow the escalation of Medicaid \ncosts. But I am not for slowing the environment and I am not for \nslowing education, an observation that has been made on this floor time \nand time again and just seems so patently clear and obvious, and yet I \npick up the paper and it never points it out except ``Congress Bogged \nAgain,'' ``Congress Can't Gets Its Act Together,'' blah, blah, blah. \nAnd all you have to do is sit down and say let us crank the Government \nup, pass a continuing resolution. After all, a continuing resolution \nfunds these agencies at a dramatic discount from what they have been \ngetting.\n  Mr. REID. Twenty-five percent.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. I thank the Senator for yielding. We can sit here I \nguess and engage in this colloquy all evening. I thank the Senator very \nmuch for allowing me to interject this.\n  Mr. REID. As always, I appreciate the statement of my friend from \nArkansas.\n  Mr. President, I see the majority leader in the Chamber. I have \nyielded to everybody else and certainly I am happy to yield to him.\n  I am told, Mr. President, that the leaders want to have a unanimous-\nconsent request entered. I am happy to yield to them without my losing \nthe right to the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The majority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Nevada, Senator \nReid.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/12/21/senate-section/article/S19080-3", "month": "12", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "21", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S19081-S19082]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   UNANIMOUS-CONSENT AGREEMENT--CONFERENCE REPORT ON H.R. 4 AND VETO \n                          MESSAGE ON H.R. 1058\n\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that following \nSenator Reid's remarks, the veto message be laid aside, and the Senate \nturn to the conference report to accompany H.R. 4, the welfare bill, \nthat it be considered under the following time restraints: 3 hours to \nbe equally divided in the usual form.\n  Mr. President, I further ask unanimous consent that at 10:15 a.m., on \nFriday, there be 30 minutes for closing remarks on securities, to be \nequally divided in the usual form, and that at 10:45 a.m., there be 30 \nminutes for closing remarks on welfare, to be equally divided in the \nusual form.\n  Finally, Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that at 11:15 a.m., \nthe Senate proceed to vote on the question shall H.R. 1058 pass, the \nobjections of the President to the contrary notwithstanding, to be \nfollowed immediately by a vote on adoption of the Welfare conference \nreport.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there any objection?\n  Mr. KENNEDY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Reserving the right to object. If the result of this \nunanimous-consent request is made, we will vote on the two matters that \nare referred to, but we will not have an opportunity, given what the \nHouse of Representatives has just done--and that is, effectively they \nare recessing tomorrow without a continuing resolution, which will mean \nthat millions of children will be unattended to, millions of the \ndisabled will be unattended to. Effectively, do I understand the \nmajority leader is making a request for those votes tomorrow on those \ntwo without giving any indication as to what the majority's intention \nis going to be, particularly without a continuing resolution, the \nimpact that it is going to have on children and the disabled in this \ncountry?\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I say to the Senator from Massachusetts, \nthere is a meeting with the President tomorrow morning with the \nleadership in the Senate and the House. It is my hope that after the \nmeeting is concluded we may be in a position to do something under the \nCR. I can only speak for myself. I am prepared to do that now, but the \nHouse has not sent us one.\n  I think there will be an effort by the Democratic leader to call up \nand amend the bill that is now pending, which I would be constrained to \nobject to. But there are others that will be affected in addition to \nveterans. I think there are four or five groups. It seems to me, if \nnothing else is successful, we ought to amend the one that the House \nsent over dealing with veterans and put all the other groups on so they \nwill not be deprived of any benefits or delay in their checks, if \neverything else fails, as far as the CR is concerned.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I will just take another moment.\n  Mr. President, I appreciate the willingness and the commitment of the \nmajority leader to do that. As the Senator knows, the House has passed \nnow their resolution just a few moments ago which effectively puts them \nin recess for 3 days, with the possibility of extending 3 more days, \nthe possibility of extending 3 more days, with a 12-hour call-back, and \nwithout any continuing resolution, which will be in effect as of 2:30 \ntomorrow afternoon.\n  We are being asked to consent to this agreement, where the final \nvotes of which will be some time in the midday; \n\n[[Page S19082]]\nand the House of Representatives, according to the House rules and the \nSenate rules, then will be permitted to effectively recess without \ncorresponding necessary action by the Senate. And the particular groups \nthat the majority leader has addressed, their needs will be left \nunattended.\n  I just want to know what the intention of the majority is going to be \nwith regard to those individuals, particularly since the majority \nleader has indicated to the minority leader that he has every \nindication that he is going to object to a clean continuing resolution.\n  This appears to be the only avenue that is left open to us. I just \nlearned a few moments ago that this was the action that was taken in \nthe House. And this is the inevitable action that will result if the \nHouse takes off and we pass this. Those individuals which the majority \nleader has identified, they will be left unattended while the House of \nRepresentatives recesses and while evidently we will be unable to take \nany action. We will be foreclosed from taking any action too. And I \nfind that that is a troublesome response.\n  I want to say at this point, I know that the majority leader has been \nvery positive and constructive in trying to move the larger issue about \nthe reconciliation on the budget forward. I think all of us understand \nthat he has tried to be and is a positive force toward moving in that \ndirection. So I am not at this time trying to interrupt that continued \nkind of effort.\n  But that really is independent from the groups that the majority \nleader has mentioned, from their needs being served. I fail to see how \nwe are going to be able to reach any conclusion with regard to those \nindividuals because it will require both bodies taking action.\n  Is that the understanding of the majority leader?\n  Mr. DOLE. It is my understanding--I would have to check--but what \nhappened in the House was simply to give the Speaker authority to \nrecess for 3-day periods in accordance with their rules. I do not \nbelieve the recess takes effect at 2:30 tomorrow. It is my \nunderstanding our meeting at the White House should end about 11:15, \n11:30.\n  If we can accomplish something tomorrow morning, which I believe we \ncan, then it would be my hope that the House would then--either we \namend the bill that is over here with a CR or they send us a CR. I am \nnot an advocate of shutting down the Government. I never have been.\n  We have indicated in a letter to Senator Warner and others that we \nwould support on this side and the House side paying all those who were \nfurloughed. But I think we have a larger problem, as pointed out by the \nSenator from Massachusetts. If everything else fails, I think the least \nwe should do is take up the bill that is now here concerning veterans \nand add to it the other categories that might be affected.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I appreciate that. So that would be the intention of the \nmajority leader.\n  I will not object to the request. I want to commend the majority \nleader for that responsible action. I hope that during the time between \nnow and tomorrow that he would use his persuasive powers, which he uses \nso frequently around here, to encourage that action be taken in a \nsimilar way by the House of Representatives.\n  Mr. DOLE. I thank my colleague from Massachusetts. I certainly will \nmake every effort. I am not certain I will be successful, but I share \nmany of the views he has expressed.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, and I \nshall not object, it would be the right of any Senator to ask at this \ntime that the conference report to accompany H.R. 4, the Personal \nResponsibility Act, be read in its entirety by the clerk. Such a \nreading would provide the first indication to most Senators of what is \nin this conference report. It has been 3 full months since the bill \npassed the Senate, but the conference committee met only once, 2 months \nago, October 24, and conducted no business at the meeting other than \nopening statements. The entire conference process was conducted behind \nclosed doors and without participation by the minority, which is one \nreason why there is not a single Democratic signature on this \nconference report.\n  I was able to obtain a copy of the conference report only a few hours \nago, as the House completed its consideration. We are woefully \nuninformed as to the details, but may I say that all any Senator needs \nto know about this legislation is that it would repeal title IV-A of \nthe Social Security Act, Aid to Families with Dependent Children, and \nthat it will be vetoed by President Clinton. Mr. President, I do not \nobject.\n  I simply want to make the point that this partisan mode is not the \nway great social-political issues are addressed successfully in our \ncountry, and I hope this will pass with the coming of Christmas.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/12/21/senate-section/article/S19081-1", "month": "12", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "21", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S19082]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              UNANIMOUS-CONSENT AGREEMENT--START II TREATY\n\n  Mr. DOLE.

Mr. President, I associate myself with the remarks made \nby the distinguished Senator from Massachusetts. Many of us have \nwatched with some dismay as the House continues to refuse to offer a \nresolution which funds the Government. They have now provided for a \nresolution which only funds that part of the continuing resolution \ndealing with veterans. We have no objection at all to the veterans \nresolution coming to the floor and passing it.\n  We would like to offer an amendment which does that for everything \nelse, including the children and many others who are adversely affected \nby this Government shutdown.\n  It is our hope that at some point, certainly before the end of the \nweek, that can be done and would like to see if it could be done \ntonight.\n  So, Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate now \nproceed to House Joint Resolution 134, the veterans' continuing \nappropriations resolution; that the bill be read a third time and \npassed, as amended, with an amendment that will reopen the Government \nand keep it open until January 5, 1995; and that the motion to \nreconsider be laid upon the table.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I do reserve the right to object and I shall \nobject, because it does not seem to me this will serve any constructive \npurpose at this time.\n  We are going back tomorrow. The principals are going to meet on a \nbalanced budget in 7 years. I am not certain what action the House will \ntake on this this evening, in any event.\n  As I indicated to the Senator from Massachusetts, and I will again \nstate to the Democratic leader, it is my hope we can make enough \nprogress tomorrow that we can do precisely what he recommends. Maybe \nthe date will not be January 5. I do not know about that date. It does \nseem to me we have made progress today. If we make some in the morning, \nperhaps we cannot only do some other legislative business, but also \npass a continuing resolution. Therefore, I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, let me just say, I hope as a result of \nthe meeting tomorrow at the White House we can move forward with some \nform of a continuing resolution tomorrow. I would like it to be a \ncomplete continuing resolution, obviously, dealing with \n\n[[Page S19083]]\nveterans and children and the whole range of those who are adversely \naffected by this shutdown.\n  It must not go on. We simply cannot leave with this matter left \nunresolved. And so it is important that regardless of what happens at \nthe meeting tomorrow, the Senate be on record in support of a \ncontinuing resolution which completely funds the Government for a \nperiod of time. I am hopeful the majority leader and I can work \ntogether to make that happen at some point tomorrow under any set of \ncircumstances.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DORGAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada has the floor and \nyielded to the two leaders for the purpose of the unanimous-consent \nrequest. Does the Senator from Nevada yield or reclaim the floor?\n  Mr. DOLE. What is the pending business now?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Completing the statement of the Senator from \nNevada, the pending business will be the conference report.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I simply want to make an inquiry of the \nmajority leader. I wonder if the Senator from Nevada will allow me to \ndo that.\n  Mr. REID. I will, without losing my right to the floor. We talked \nabout records. Senator Dole talked about his record. I think I have \nbroken a record. I have been here and yielded 12 times. I will be happy \nto make it for the 13th.\n  [Laughter.]\n  Mr. DORGAN. Make mine the 14th.\n  Mr. REID. This is the 13th.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/12/21/senate-section/article/S19082-2", "month": "12", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "21", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S19083]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             THE FARM BILL\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I appreciate the Senator yielding to me. I \nwould like to inquire of the majority leader on the subject of the farm \nbill. Senator Dole comes from farm country, as many of us do in the \nChamber, and we face an unusual circumstance toward the end of this \nyear. This is the year we normally would have written a 5-year farm \nplan. A plan has not been written. One was in the original legislation \nthat was passed by the Senate that was vetoed by the President, the \nreconciliation bill.\n  Many of us are concerned, as are farmers from across the country, \nabout what will be the decision of Congress, what kind of circumstance \nmight exist for them and their lenders to anticipate with respect to \nplanting next year, what kind of support prices and so on.\n  I just rise to inquire of the majority leader what his thinking is \nabout the movement of a farm bill or the extension of the current farm \nprogram for a year. What is the current thinking of the majority leader \non that subject?\n  Mr. DOLE. Obviously, I share the concern expressed by the Senator \nfrom North Dakota.\n  Let me first indicate, there will be no more votes today, because I \nhave had inquiries.\n  It is my understanding that at 3:30 or 4 o'clock this afternoon, \nthere was a discussion of the so-called farm bill with different \nrepresentatives from the White House and others who were there. I would \nlike to see it part of this package that I hope we can agree on that \nwill give us a balanced budget but still include the agriculture \nlegislation. It is important not only to the Midwest where we are from, \nbut very important to consumers in America and other farmers across \nthis country.\n  A 1-year extension, if everything else fails, might be an option. As \nthe Senator knows, if that does not happen, we go back to, what is it, \n1948, 1949, which would not be very productive, in my view. It would be \nvery high price supports. So I am hopeful that we can work--we are \nworking in a bipartisan way. I say to the Democratic leader, talking \nabout when we get to agriculture, it must be one of the areas we must \nagree on if we are going to come together and pass a package.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I appreciate the answer. I point out, as the Senator \nknows, the urgency with which many farmers view this process, whether \nit is in or out of a reconciliation bill. I think farmers and their \nlenders need some understanding of what will be the circumstances for \ntheir planting next year, what might or might not be the price support \nsystem.\n  I am not suggesting there is blame here. I am suggesting somehow we \nneed to get to a decision and it might be the extension of the current \nfarm bill or it might be a different plan put in the reconciliation \nbill. If a reconciliation bill does not occur, then would there be a \ncontingency and does the Senator share the urgency many of us feel on \nthis floor about the need to resolve this issue?\n  Mr. DOLE. I have been on the Ag Committee--I think I have the record \nof more service on the Ag Committee than any other member on that \ncommittee. We have gone through this a number of times. Certainly, it \nis very important, very significant for America's farmers. I feel, I \nhope, as deeply as the Senator from North Dakota and others in the \nChamber, when we have large numbers of farmers and ranchers in our \nStates. I hope we can reach some conclusion. If not, we may have to \nlook at an extension for a year.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Thank you.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, if I can ask the Senator from Nevada to \nyield just one more time.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/12/21/senate-section/article/S19083-1", "month": "12", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "21", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S19083]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        SENATOR BYRD'S COMMENTS\n\n  Mr. DOLE.

Mr. President, I am here to speak on the securities \nlitigation veto override. I want everyone in Nevada to know that this \nis the same issue that a few weeks ago Senator Bryan and I disagreed \non. It is not a new issue. You see, in Nevada, Mr. President, it is \nnews when Senator Bryan and Senator Reid disagree on an issue, so I \nrepeat for the people of Nevada this is the same issue; it is not a new \nissue, because we vary so little in our outlook on what is good \nGovernment.\n  Mr. President, there are a lot of issues today that perhaps I would \nrather be debating, but the parliamentary measure now before us is the \nsecurities litigation. A balanced budget or welfare reform would \ncertainly be more timely. There are a number of other issues we should \nperhaps be dealing with. But the matter that is now before this body is \na bipartisan piece of legislation designed to curtail the filing of \nfrivolous security strike suits.\n  Yesterday, in the House of Representatives, 83 Democrats voted to \noverride, joining the Republicans to obtain, of course, over 300 House \nvotes, significantly more than enough to override the President's veto.\n  I am distressed that the President has decided to veto this moderate, \ncentrist approach to litigation reform. I am concerned that he has \nvetoed this legislation for the wrong reasons.\n  I have reviewed closely his veto message. It does not take very long \nto read. It would appear he has found very few substantive reasons for \nvetoing the measure. I believe that the President of the United States \nreceived very bad staff advice. One need only look at a number of \neditorials written this morning in the papers around the country. One \nin the Washington Times today says, among other things ``According to \nadministration aides, the crucial moment came when New York University \nLaw School Professor John Sexton visited the White House to personally \nargue that the legislation should be vetoed.''\n  I do not know who John Sexton met with, whether it was staff in the \nWhite House or whether it was the President, but if it were staff and \nthe message was carried to the President, it was pretty bad information \nbecause had the staff properly advised the President, they would have \nfound that this man is not really a law professor in the true sense of \nthe word but, rather, he is the dean of a law school. In fact, if this \nadvice was delivered from a professor, as has been stated, without \nclear vested interests on either side of the hotly contested issue, \nthen the staff gave the President some pretty bad advice, because \naccording to The Wall Street \n\n[[Page S19084]]\nJournal that is what decided things for Mr. Clinton, because he \nreceived advice without clear vested interests on either side of the \nhotly contested issue.\n\n  I believe the staff gave the President some very bad advice. Why? \nBecause Mr. Sexton is not just a professor at New York University \nschool of law, but rather he is the dean of the school of law.\n  One of the prime functions of the dean of a law school is to raise \nmoney for the law school. It is interesting to note--and I think the \nPresident should have known this--and it is too bad that the staff did \nnot tell him, that one of the first major donations to New York \nUniversity School of Law during Mr. Sexton's tenure as dean of the law \nschool was in 1990 when Mr. and Mrs. Melvin Weiss donated $1 million to \nthe school, and then led a campaign to raise another $5 million.\n  It is interesting to note, Mr. President, that this Mr. Weiss is the \nWeiss in Milberg, Weiss, Bershad, Haynes & Lerach.\n  So it seems to me that the staff and the advisors that gave this \ninformation to the President failed to tell him that this man and his \nlaw school received $1 million from Mr. Lerach's law firm. Then the \nsame partner in the law firm went ahead and helped raise $5 million. \nSo, I think it goes without saying that he received some biased advice.\n  None of the objections were raised by the White House prior to the \nvote on the conference report. I understand it is a large bill and that \nthere may be parts the White House disagrees with, but the veto message \nwas pretty skimpy, Mr. President. It makes little sense to reject this \nmeasure and all the bipartisan efforts that went into drafting it.\n  The current system encourages plaintiffs to file strike suits at \nwill.\n  Mr. President, I think the President got some bad advice. I think \nwhat he should have done and what his staff should have shown to him is \na memorandum that is dated December 19, directed to the President of \nthe United States, to the Office of White House Counsel. In this, there \nwould have been a clear statement as to answering the main problem the \nPresident said in his very brief veto statement.\n  This memorandum was written by Prof. Joseph A. Grundfest, of Stanford \nSchool of Law. Professor Grundfest is a man who can speak with some \nauthority. He is not only a professor at Stanford, one of the foremost \nlaw schools in the entire world, but he joined Stanford's faculty 5 \nyears ago after having served as Commissioner of the United States \nSecurities and Exchange Commission. I will not go through his entire \nresume, but he knows something about securities.\n  What he said to the President is that the pleading standard is \nfaithful to the second circuit's test.\n\n       Indeed, I concur with the decision to eliminate the Specter \n     amendment language, which was an incomplete and inaccurate \n     codification of case law in the circuit.\n       As is stated in a recent Harvard Law Review article, \n     codification of a uniform pleading standard in 10b-5 cases \n     would eliminate the current confusion among circuits. The \n     Second circuit standard is among the most thoroughly tested, \n     and it also balances deterrence of unjustified claims with \n     need to retain a strong private right of action. Indeed, the \n     second circuit is widely respected for its legal \n     sophistication . . . .\n\n  This is the type of scholarly counsel the President should have been \nprovided by the staff. In fact, they were directed to one of the law \npartners' donatees, someone who had given the law school large sums of \nmoney.\n  Mr. President, the current system encourages plaintiffs to file \nstrike suits at will. The system almost operates like a pyramid scheme \nwhere investors are encouraged to get in early but ultimately lose out \nto the operators of the scam--in this case, these attorneys. How quick \nare these suits filed? We heard statements this morning that they have \nbeen filed within minutes of the stock dropping. I heard a statement \ntoday of 90 minutes.\n  In dismissing the Philip Morris securities litigation, the court in \nthe Southern District of New York, noted that 10 lawsuits were filed \nwithin 2 business days of a drop in earnings being announced. In one \ncase, a suit was filed within 5 hours of the announcement. They were \nslow. They have beaten that by at least 3\\1/2\\ hours. In that case, the \ncourt states:\n\n       . . . in the few hours counsel devoted to getting the \n     initial complaints to the courthouse, overlooked was the fact \n     that two of them contained identical allegations, apparently \n     lodged in counsel's computer memory of ``fraud'' form \n     complaints, that the defendants here engaged in conduct to \n     prolong the illusion of success . . . .\n\n  The judge, in that case, found it hard to believe that the \nshareholders could have contacted their lawyers to file suit so \nquickly. The speed with which they file these suits suggests that these \nattorneys are constantly on a hunt for any drop in a stock price. This \nis really a form of Wall Street ambulance chasing. The Philip Morris \ncase is, unfortunately, not the unusual. It is a competitive business \namong a very small group of lawyers. Each attempts to get in on the \nbottom floor of each action. They follow the old Chicago corollary on \nelections: file early and file often. Why? Because the lawyer that is \ndesignated the lead counsel by the court is in the best position to \ncollect attorney's fees.\n  Mr. President, in a single 44-month period, one plaintiff's law firm \nalone filed 229 separate 10b-5 suits around the country, the equivalent \nof filing one 10b-5 every 4.2 business days. Almost 70 percent of the \n10b-5 class actions filed by Milberg Weis, the leading securities \nlitigation plaintiffs firm, over a 3-year period were filed within 10 \ndays of when the stock price dropped.\n  Now, if you look at the editorial today from the Wall Street Journal, \nyou find it quite interesting. They ask rhetorically, why did President \nClinton veto this? They say, among other things:\n\n       So what is the big show-stopper? Mr. Clinton singles out \n     several minor clauses, especially the language on ``pleading \n     requirements.''\n\n  I already addressed that:\n\n       This is the part of the bill designed to ensure that \n     lawyers state a specific cause of action . . . before being \n     allowed to paw through a company's files. Mr. Clinton says he \n     is prepared to accept a higher pleading standard, just not as \n     high as the one called for here.\n\n  They go on to say:\n\n       This is why he vetoed the entire bill? Give us a break. \n     Even Sen. Dodd doesn't buy it. In a statement, he said, \n     [Senator Dodd] ``While I respect the President's decision, \n     frankly I'm surprised at the reasons, raised at the 11th \n     hour, which are relatively minor given the real scope and \n     degree of the strike-suit problem. In fact, they have been \n     resolved over the course of the more than four years it took \n     to carefully craft this compromise, bipartisan legislation.''\n\n  That is a statement from Senator Chris Dodd.\n  The Wall Street article goes on to say:\n\n       If the Democrats are to put together a forward-looking, \n     next-century agenda that can attract widespread support, \n     they've got to get off their bended knee before groups like \n     the trial lawyers.\n\n  Defrauded investors are not adequately compensated because attorneys, \nnot investors, control these class actions. The average class action \nsettlement gives investors only 14 cents for every dollar lost, while \none-third of each settlement and more goes to the attorneys.\n  The legitimacy of the plaintiffs must be examined. Some are clearly \nprofessional plaintiffs who lend their names to any class action suit. \nOne study of 229 cases showed 81 people were plaintiffs more than once. \nThese are not aggrieved, injured parties, but professional plaintiffs, \nand the lawyers know it.\n  If you do not believe me, Mr. President, listen to the words of one \nof the plaintiff's attorneys who benefit from the status quo. An \nattorney by the name of William Barrett told Forbes Magazine, ``I have \nthe best practice in the world because I have no clients.'' This might \nbe funny if it were not so true and so costly.\n  Just how expensive is maintaining the status quo? One report stated \nthat it cost companies an average of $8.6 million in settlement fees, \n$700,000 in attorney's fees, and about 1,000 hours of management time \nto settle the typical frivolous securities suit.\n  Status quo means companies will have to pay these costs rather than \ncreate new products and, I submit, new jobs.\n  Mr. President, who pays for these costs? These costs are passed on to \ninvestors in the form of stock price devaluation and lower dividends. \nThis undermines the confidence of all investors in our capital markets.\n  Let us look at specific costs one company faced because of the \ncurrent pro-\n\n[[Page S19085]]\ntrial lawyer's laws. After one company, called Adapt Technology, went \npublic, it was advised to carry $5 million in director and officer \nliability insurance. This cost them $450,000 each year for premiums. \nPrior to going public they paid a few thousand dollars per year. To be \nexact, less than $29,000. The additional insurance is needed because of \nthe virtual certainty that the company will be sued for securities \nfraud within a short time after going public, and then they have to be \nconcerned about the different margins where the stock falls. If Adapt \ndid not have to pay this additional liability insurance they say they \ncould hire at least five new engineers.\n  I know there have been mayors and other officials around the country \nwho have been given information, mostly from these lawyers, that this \nis bad for them. They write to me and others, still talking about the \noriginal House version of the bill which certainly is not anything we \nhave before us now, saying this is not what they want.\n  I would like to refer to some people who support this legislation \nbecause there is lots of support of our people at home who want this \nlegislation approved. They want this veto overridden.\n  Bill Owens, State treasurer of the State of Colorado, in a letter \nstates, ``The plaintiffs typically recover only a small percentage of \ntheir claims and the lawyers extract large fees for bringing the suit. \nA system that was intended to protect investors now seems to benefit \nthe lawyers.''\n  We also have a letter, part of a letter from the State treasurer of \nDelaware. Certainly Delaware--that is where most corporations are \nformed--I think we should give some credence to the treasurer of the \nState of Delaware, where she says, ``Investors are also being harmed by \nthe current system as it shortchanges people who are being victimized \nby real fraud. The plaintiff's lawyers who specialize in these cases \nprofit from bringing as many cases as possible and quickly settling \nthem, regardless of the merits. Valid claims are being undercompensated \nin the current system because lawyers have less incentive to vigorously \npursue them.''\n  Another State treasurer, Judy Topinka, from the State of Illinois, in \na letter to Senator Moseley-Braun writes, ``Because shareholders are on \nboth sides of this litigation it merely transfers wealth from one group \nof shareholders to another. However it wastes millions of dollars in \ncompany resources for legal expenses and other transaction costs that \notherwise could be invested to yield higher returns for company \ninvestors.''\n  ``The concern about and reaction to meritless lawsuits has caused \naccountants, lawyers and insurance companies to insure their directors \nwith price tags ultimately paid by the consumer and investing public \nincluding a large part of our retirees and pension holders.'' So says \nJoe Malone, Treasurer of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.\n  The treasurer of North Carolina: ``I agree,'' he says, ``that the \ncurrent securities fraud litigation system is not protecting investors \nand needs reform.''\n  The treasurer of the State of Ohio and the treasurer of the State of \nOregon say similar things. The treasurer of the State of South \nCarolina, the treasurer of the State of Wisconsin, the treasurer of the \nState of California state similar things.\n  So, if we look to our States for guidance we should follow what our \ntreasurers say.\n  But there are others who support this securities litigation reform \nand there would be many more that would support the securities \nlitigation reform had they not been given such bad information early on \nthat scared them to death. The information was given to them by these \nlawyers who make a fortune with these security litigation lawsuits. \nSupporters of the securities litigation reform, I will read off a few \nof the names: American Business Conference, American Electronics \nAssociation, American Financial Services Association, American \nInstitute of Certified Public Accountants, Association for Investment \nManagement and Research, Association of Private Pension and Welfare \nPlans, Association of Publicly-traded Companies, BIOCOM--formerly \nBiomedical Industry Council--Biotechnology Industry Association, \nBusiness Round Table, Commissioner of Corporations of the State of \nCalifornia, Champion International Pension Plan--one of the largest in \nthe United States--Director of Revenues of the city of Chicago, \nCoalition to Eliminate Abusive Security Suits, Connecticut Retirement \nand Trust Fund, Eastman Kodak Retirement Plan, Electronics Industries \nAssociation, chief administrative officer of the State of Florida, \nInformation Technology Association of America, Massachusetts Bay \nTransportation Association, National Association of Investors Corp., \nNational Association of Manufacturers, National Investor Relations \nInstitute, National Venture Capital Association, Governor of the State \nof New Mexico, Comptroller of the City of New York, New York City \nPension Funds, Oregon Public Employees Retirement System, Public \nSecurities Association, Securities Industries Association, \nSemiconductor Industry Association, Silicon Valley Chief Executives \nAssociation, Software Publishers Association, Teachers Retirement \nSystem of Texas, Washington State Investment Board--just to name a few \nof those that want something to happen, namely that this veto be \noverridden.\n  There are a lot of good reasons to support this measure. Frivolous \nstrike suits are not simply windfalls to unscrupulous attorneys, but \nthey are costing our Nation jobs. They are inhibiting the development \nof high technology in every State in the Union. It is almost a \ncertainty that start-up companies will get, with the formation of the \ncompany--a strong chance that soon thereafter there will be a \nsecurities class action lawsuit after they have gone public. The \ninformation provided to the Senate Banking Committee indicates that 19 \nof the largest 30 companies in Silicon Valley have been sued since \n1988.\n  According to another study, 62 percent of all entrepreneurial \ncompanies that went public since 1986 have been sued. This was by 1993, \nwhen the records were made available to us. In the last year and a \nhalf, I will bet we are nearing 80 or 90 percent. They file them almost \nas fast as they can. This is just in Silicon Valley.\n  So, as one of the Senators from Nevada, I find this disappointing. \nThere are other reasons for supporting this legislation. By \ndiscouraging frivolous security suits, companies can use their capital \nto increase shareholder returns. They could expand research and \ndevelopment. They could create new jobs. The conference report also \nensures that victims of securities fraud and not their lawyers are \nwinners.\n  I think that one reason we are hearing the screaming from these \nlawyers is that under this conference report, under this legislation, \nthe people who will benefit if they have been cheated will be the \npeople who have been cheated, not the lawyers and the professional \nplaintiffs. Too often these attorneys collect millions of dollars while \ntheir clients collect only pennies.\n  What about investors? Investors are harmed by the status quo because \ncompanies are reluctant to provide estimates about future performance \nfor fear they will be sued. The conference report remedied this by \nproviding for the safe harbor, while the Chairman of the SEC said he \napproved this.\n  Let us also talk about the work done on this legislation by the \nsenior Senator from the State of Connecticut. I remind my colleagues, \nmy Democratic colleagues who voted for this measure originally, that \nthis issue is not about supporting the President. This issue is about \nsupporting the chairman of the Democratic National Committee, who has \nspent countless hours working on this legislation, drafting this \nlegislation, debating this legislation, and who worked with the White \nHouse up to the very end to get their approval on what was done. So \nthis is not a question about supporting the President. It is a question \nof those who originally supported this bill yanking the rug out from \nsomebody who has worked very hard on this legislation. He has done so \nin consultation with the White House. The White House has been included \nfrom the very beginning. That is a tribute to the senior Senator from \nConnecticut.\n  He was instrumental in including the White House in developing this \nlegislation. There have been good-faith efforts to consult with the \nadministration every step of the way. And when this legislation left \nthe Senate, the senior Senator from Connecticut said, ``I will \n\n[[Page S19086]]\nsupport this legislation when it comes back from conference only if it \nmatches what we have done here in the Senate.'' That is, that it \nfollows what we have done here in the Senate.\n  Certainly that is what it did. The Senate position was what was \nadopted. The President's weak ideas for vetoing this, we have gone \nover.\n  There are people who do not like this legislation, and I respect them \nfor that. I respect them for that. But those people who supported this \nlegislation initially should understand that one of our leaders, \nSenator Dodd, has spent a great deal of time and effort on this \nlegislation and he does not deserve any of the 18 Democratic Senators \nwho voted for this to have jerked the rug out from under him. He \ndeserves more than that. He works on a daily basis for all Democratic \nSenators. But certainly let us not do this to him. As chairman of the \nDNC, he is probably more in sync with the desires of the body politic \nthan the rest of us. He knows what direction our party should be \nheaded, and he realizes that the centrist commonsense proposals, such \nas we are now asking of the majority of this Senate should be given our \nsupport.\n\n  I ask my Democratic colleagues to consider this when voting on the \noverride. Consider the work that has gone into this by the senior \nSenator from Connecticut.\n  This is needed legislation that will do much good. This will put some \nlawyers out of the kind of work they have been doing making fortunes. \nThey may have to get another practice, or another type of law, or maybe \nstart doing work in which they get paid on an hourly basis. But in the \nlong run, it will also create many new jobs and benefit small \ninvestors. It represents the moderate centrist approach to legislating \nthat we ought to be engaged in here.\n  I respect the opposition to this legislation. There are some people \nwho simply did not like it to begin with. It is a very small minority. \nBut I respect them for that. But those that supported this legislation \non this side of the aisle should stick with our leader on this issue, \nthat is, Senator Dodd who has spent so much time on this legislation.\n  This legislation does not represent the ideology of the liberal left \nor the radical right. It represents a commonsense, bipartisan \nconsensus, and I believe that is what the voters sent us here to do.\n  There is speculation as to why it was vetoed. I am not going to \nengage in that other than to say that the President got some real bad \nadvice. The absence of persuasion in the veto message does little to \nquell any speculation.\n  I must say, however, that the death of this legislation only benefits \na very small group of lawyers who have ruthlessly exploited current \nlaws. They do so to the detriment of small investors and those who have \nlegitimate claims. Their access to money has endowed them with \ntremendous influence in this debate, and I believe that is regrettable.\n  I believe, Mr. President, that this legislation is fair. I think it \nis directly going to help clear up an area of law that needs clearing \nup.\n  To those people who are talking about investors not being protected, \nI repeat that Senator Dodd went to great lengths to work with the vast \nmajority of people on the other side of the aisle, with the White \nHouse, and a number of Senators on this side, making sure that \ninvestors would still be protected. Investors will be protected, but \nthe lawyers who have been getting these exorbitant fees will not be \nprotected if this veto is overridden, which I hope it is.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/12/21/senate-section/article/S19083-3", "month": "12", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "21", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S19086-S19107]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n    PERSONAL RESPONSIBILITY AND WORK ACT OF 1995--CONFERENCE REPORT\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Without objection, the Senate will proceed to \nthe consideration of the conference report.\n  (The conference report is printed in the House proceedings of the \nRecord of December 20, 1995.)\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, sometime ago the American people reached a \nturning point concerning welfare reform. They understand that despite \nhaving spent over $5 trillion over the past 30 years, the welfare \nsystem is a catastrophic failure.\n  In 1965, 15.6 percent of all families with children under the age of \n18 had incomes below the poverty level. And in 1993, 18.5 percent of \nfamilies with children under the age of 18 were under the Federal \npoverty level. The system created to end poverty has helped to bring \nmore poverty. By destroying the work ethic and undermining the \nformation of family, the welfare system has lured more Americans into a \ncruel cycle of dependency. The size and cost of the welfare programs \nare at historically high levels and are out of control. Federal, State, \nand local governments now spend over $350 billion on means-tested \nprograms.\n  Between 1965 and 1992, the number of children receiving AFDC has \ngrown by nearly 200 percent. Yet, the entire population of children \nunder the age of 18 has declined--declined by 5.5 percent over this \nsame period. More than 1.5 million children have been added to the AFDC \ncaseload since 1990. And if we do nothing, if we do nothing to reform \nit, the number of children receiving AFDC is expected to grow from 9.6 \nmillion today to 12 million within 10 years.\n  That is what the future holds if the current system is allowed to \ncontinue. A welfare system run by Washington simply costs too much and \nproduces too little in terms of results.\n  Twenty years ago, 4.3 million people received food stamp benefits. In \n1994, that number had grown to 27.5 million people, an increase of more \nthan 500 percent. And between 1990 and 1994 alone, the number of people \nreceiving food stamps grew by nearly 7.5 million people.\n  In 1974, the Supplemental Security Income Program was established to \nreplace former programs serving low-income elderly and disabled \npersons. SSI was considered to be a type of retirement program for \npeople who had not been able to contribute enough for Social Security \nbenefits. Of the 3.9 million recipients in 1974, 2.3 million were \nelderly adults. The number of elderly adults has actually declined by \n36 percent.\n  But consider this: In 1982, noncitizens constituted 3 percent of all \nSSI recipients. By 1993, noncitizens constituted nearly 12 percent of \nthe entire SSI caseload. Today, almost 1 out of every four elderly SSI \nrecipients is a noncitizen.\n  Before 1990, the growth in the number of disabled children receiving \nSSI was moderate, averaging 3 percent annually since 1984. Then, in the \nbeginning of 1990, and through 1994, the growth averaged 25 percent \nannually and the number trimmed to nearly 900,000 children. The number \nof disabled children receiving cash assistance under the Supplemental \nSecurity Income Program has increased by 166 percent since 1990 \nalone. The maximum SSI benefit is greater than the maximum AFDC benefit \nfor a family of three in 40 States.\n\n  Welfare reform is necessary today because while the rest of the \nNation has gone through a series of social transformations, the Federal \nbureaucracy has been left behind, still searching in vain for the \nsolution to the problems of poverty. It simply will not be found in \nWashington.\n  Our colleague, Senator Moynihan, has reminded us on a number of \noccasions that the AFDC Program began 60 years ago as a sort of widow's \npension. Consider that the AFDC Program cost $697 million in 1947 \nmeasured in constant 1995 dollars. In 1995, the Federal Government \nspent $18 billion on the AFDC population, an increase of 2,500 percent \nmeasured in constant dollars. \n\n[[Page S19087]]\n\n  Now, the AFDC Program was originally intended to be a modest means to \nkeep a family together in dignity. But much has changed since then and \nthe system has become a cruel hoax on our young people. It has torn \nfamilies apart and left them without the dignity of work.\n  Washington does not know how to build strong families because it has \nforgotten what makes families strong. It has failed to understand the \nconsequences of idleness and illegitimacy.\n  Last March, the House of Representatives charted an ambitious course \nfor welfare reform in the 104th Congress. H.R. 4, the Personal \nResponsibility Act of 1995, was a bold challenge to all of us. It was a \ncreative and comprehensive response to the many problems we currently \nface in the complex welfare system.\n  Since then, the Senate has continued the national debate and built on \nthe blueprint provided by the House. Just 3 months ago, the Senate \ndemonstrated that it recognized dramatic and sweeping reforms are \nnecessary. The Work Opportunity Act passed the Senate with an \noverwhelming and bipartisan vote of 87 to 12.\n  Today, I am here to present to the Senate and to the American people \nH.R. 4, the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Act of 1995. \nH.R. 4 ends the individual entitlement to Federal cash assistance under \nthe current AFDC Program. It also caps the total amount of Federal \nfunding over the next 7 years. These are the critical pieces of welfare \nreform which will institute dramatic changes the American people want.\n  These two provisions are the key to everything else which will \ntranspire in the States. They make all other reforms possible. They \nguarantee the national debate about work and family will be repeated in \nevery statehouse. Fiscal discipline will force the State to set \npriorities. Block grants will provide them with the flexibility needed \nto design their own system to break the cycle of dependency. And most \nimportantly, this legislation restores the work ethic and reinforces \nthe value of the family as the fundamental cell of our society.\n\n  Mr. President, after decades of research and rhetoric, it is indeed \ntime to end welfare as we know it. This welfare reform initiative is \nbuilt on three basic platforms and contains all the necessary \nrequirements of authentic welfare reform.\n  First, individuals must take responsibility for their lives and \nactions. The present welfare system has sapped the spirit of so many \nAmericans because it rewards dependency. It has also allowed absent \nparents to flee their moral and legal obligations to their children. \nThis legislation ends the individual entitlement to public assistance \nand provides for a stronger child support enforcement mechanism.\n  Second, it restores the expectation that people who can help \nthemselves must help themselves. For far too long, welfare has been \nmore attractive than work. This legislation corrects the mistakes of \nthe past which allowed people to avoid work. We provide additional \nfunding for child care and incorporate educational and training \nactivities to help individuals make the transition from welfare to \nwork. Under this legislation, welfare recipients will know that welfare \nwill truly be only a temporary means of support and must prepare \nthemselves accordingly.\n  Finally, this legislation transfers power from Washington back to the \nStates where it belongs. This will yield great dividends to recipients \nand taxpayers alike. As the power is drained from Washington, Americans \nshould eagerly anticipate the reciprocal actions that take place in the \nStates. States will find more innovative ways to use this money to help \nfamilies than Washington ever imagined.\n  Freed from the current adversarial system, the States will be able to \ndesign their own unique methods to help families overcome adversity. \nThe current system insults the dignity of individuals by demanding a \nperson prove and maintain destitution. States will reverse this \ndisordered thinking and raise expectations by shifting the emphasis \nfrom what a person cannot do to what a person can do.\n  On balance, you will find that the conference reflects the work of \nthe Senate on the major issues within the Finance Committee \njurisdiction. And as you examine the individual parts and the bill as a \nwhole, I believe you will find we have been responsive to the concerns \nof the Senate.\n  The conference report provides the right mixture of flexibility to \nthe States but still retains appropriate accountability. And I think \nthe States will find this transfer of power to be a reasonable \nchallenge.\n  Here are the major specific items included in title I which creates \nthe new block grants to States for temporary assistance for needy \nfamilies with minor children.\n  Each State is entitled to receive its allocation of a national cash \nwelfare block grant which is set at $16.3 billion each year, and in \nreturn the States are required to spend at least 75 percent of the \namount they spent on cash welfare programs in 1994 over the next 5 \nyears.\n  In terms of funding, the States will be allowed to choose the greater \nof their average for the years 1992 to 1994 or their 1994 level of \nfunding or their 1995 level of funding. By allowing the States to use \ntheir 1995 funding level, we have increased Federal spending for the \nblock grant by $3.5 billion over the Senate-passed bill. We have \nmaintained the $1 billion contingency fund.\n  The States will be required to meet tough but reasonable work \nrequirements. In 1997, the work participation rate will be 20 percent. \nThis percentage will increase by 5 percentage points each year. By the \nyear 2002, half of the State total welfare caseload must be engaged in \nwork activities. As provided by the Senate bill, States will be \nrequired to enforce ``pay for performance.'' If a recipient refuses to \nwork, a pro rata reduction in benefits will be made.\n  We provide the resources to make this possible with $11 billion in \nmandatory child care funds for welfare families. Let me repeat. The \nconference report includes $1 billion more for child care than the \nSenate welfare bill.\n  Another $7 billion in discretionary funds are provided to assist low-\nincome working families. There will be a single block grant \nadministered through the child care and development block grant, but \nguaranteed funding for the welfare population.\n  The House has agreed to accept the Senate definition of work \nactivities to include vocational training.\n  The House has agreed to drop its mandatory prohibition on cash \nassistance to teenage mothers. As under the Senate bill, this will be \nan option for the States to determine. The House has accepted the \nSenate authorization for the creation of second chance homes for \nunmarried young mothers.\n  The family cap provision has been modified from both positions. Under \nthe new proposal, States will not be permitted to increase Federal \nbenefits for additional children born while a family is on welfare. \nHowever, each State will be allowed to opt out of this Federal \nprohibition by passing State legislation.\n  The sweeping reforms in child support enforcement has unfortunately \nbeen overlooked in the public debate. This has been an important area \nof bipartisan action and an important method of assisting families to \navoid and escape from poverty.\n  We are strengthening the enforcement mechanism in several ways. In \ngeneral, the conference report more closely reflects the Senate bill. \nWe reconciled several of the differences between the House and Senate \non items such as the Director of New Hires and the expansion of the \nFederal Parent Locator Service simply by choosing a midpoint. We have \nincreased funding over the Senate bill for the continued development \ncosts of automation from $260 to $400 million.\n  One particular child support enforcement issue which may be of \ninterest to you is the distribution of child support arrears. Beginning \nOctober 1, 1997, all post-assistance arrears will be distributed to the \nfamily before the State. As of October 1, 2000, all preassistance \narrears will go to the family before the State will be allowed to \nrecoup its costs.\n  We believe that improving child support collection will greatly \nassist families in avoiding and escaping poverty.\n  The American Bar Association strongly supports our child support \nenforcement changes. The ABA recently wrote that, ``if these child \nsupport reforms are enacted, it will be an historic \n\n[[Page S19088]]\nstride forward for children in our nation.'' Mr. President, we cannot \nafford to miss this historic opportunity.\n  SSI is now the largest cash assistance program for the poor and one \nof the fastest growing entitlement programs. Program costs have grown \n20 percent annually in the past 4 years. Last year, over 6 million SSI \nrecipients received nearly $22 billion in Federal benefits and over $3 \nbillion in State benefits. The maximum SSI benefit is greater than the \nmaximum AFDC benefit for a family of 3 in 40 States.\n\n  The conference agreement contains the bipartisan changes in the \ndefinition of childhood disability contained in the Senate-passed \nwelfare reform bill. I am pleased we have addressed this problem on \ncommon ground.\n  The conference rejected the House block grant approach. All eligible \nchildren will continue to receive cash assistance. We retain our \ncommitment to serving the disabled while linking assistance to need.\n  For children who become eligible in the future, there will be a two-\ntier system of benefits. All children will receive cash benefits. Those \ndisabled children requiring special personal assistance to remain at \nhome will receive a full cash benefit. For families where the need is \nnot as great, such children will receive 75 percent of the full \nbenefit.\n  No changes in children's benefits for SSI will take place before \nJanuary 1, 1997. This will allow for an orderly implementation and \nprotect the interests of current recipients.\n  These changes will restore the public's confidence in this program \nand maintain our national commitment to children with disabilities.\n  Current resident noncitizens receiving benefits on the date of \nenactment may continue to receive SSI, food stamps, AFDC, Medicaid, or \ntitle XX services until January 1, 1997. After January 1, 1997, current \nresident noncitizens may not receive food stamps or SSI unless they \nhave worked long enough to qualify for Social Security. States will \nhave the option of restricting AFDC, Medicaid, and title XX benefits.\n  Legal noncitizens arriving after the date of enactment are barred \nfrom receiving most Federal means-tested benefits during their first 5 \nyears in the United States. SSI and food stamps will remain restricted \nuntil citizenship or until the person has worked long enough to qualify \nfor Social Security. The States have the option to restrict AFDC, \nMedicaid, and title XX benefits after 5 years.\n  Mr. President, it is time to correct the fundamental mistakes made by \nthe welfare system over the past three decades. All too often, the \nsystem simply assumes that if a person lacks money, he or she also \nlacks any means of earning it. The present welfare system locks \nfamilies into permanent dependency when they only needed a temporary \nhand up. It creates poverty and dependence by destroying families and \ninitiative. To end welfare as we know it, we must put an end to the \nsystem which has done so much to trap families into dependence. The \nPersonal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Act of 1995 will \naccomplish precisely these goals.\n  From the early days of his administration, President Clinton promised \nwelfare reform to the American people. H.R. 4 meets all principles he \nhas outlined for welfare reform. If the President vetoes H.R. 4, he \nwill be preserving a system which costs and wastes billions of \ntaxpayers' dollars. More importantly, however, if the President vetoes \nH.R. 4, he will be accepting the status quo in which another 2\\1/2\\ \nmillion children will fall into the welfare system.\n  On January 24, 1995, President Clinton declared at a joint session of \nCongress, ``Nothing has done more to undermine our sense of common \nresponsibility than our failed welfare system.''\n  Mr. President, vetoing welfare reform will seriously undermine the \nAmerican people's confidence in our political system. The American \npeople know the present welfare system is a failure. They are also \ntired of empty rhetoric from politicians. Words without deeds are \nmeaningless. The time to enact welfare reform is now.\n  Mr. President, I yield back the floor.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, just as a point of inquiry, we have 3 \nhours this evening, and I assume it will be equally divided? Is that \nagreeable to my friend, the distinguished chairman?\n  Mr. ROTH. That is correct. That is my understanding.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, first, may I express my appreciation for \nthe thoughtfulness and sincerity with which the Senator from Delaware \nhas addressed this troubled issue. It is not necessarily the mode of \naddress in these times with regard to this subject. And if I do not \nagree with him, it is not for lack of respect for his views. He knows \nthat.\n  He mentioned the subject of a presidential veto, sir. And I must say \nthat there will be such. The President this morning issued a statement \nsaying that, ``If Congress sends me this conference report, I will veto \nit and insist that they try again.'' And I hope we will try again.\n  He spoke to the idea that, as he says as he concludes, ``My \nadministration remains ready at any moment to sit down in good faith \nwith Democrats and Republicans in Congress to work out a real welfare \nreform plan.''\n  May I say in that regard, first of all, that it is disappointing \nconsidering the degree of bipartisan efforts we have made with respect \nto the Social Security Act. As the Senator from Delaware stated, this \nbill would repeal the individual entitlement under title IV-A of the \nSocial Security Act, the Aid to Families with Dependent Children \nprogram.\n  The conference report before us states:\n\n       The committee on conference on the disagreeing votes of the \n     two Houses on the amendments of the Senate to the bill (H.R. \n     4), to restore the American family, reduce illegitimacy, \n     control welfare spending and reduce welfare dependence, \n     having met, after full and free conference, have agreed to \n     recommend--\n\n  Full and free conference? No, Mr. President. There was one meeting of \nthe conferees on October 24, 2 months ago. We took the occasion to make \nopening statements, and the conference, as such, has never met since. \nWe received a copy of this report late this afternoon. This is no way \nto address a matter of this consequence. Let me, if I may, state to you \nwhat consequence I refer to.\n  It is possible to think of the problem of welfare dependency, an \nenormous problem, as somehow confined to parts of our society and \ngeography, the inner-city, most quintessentially. It is certainly \nconcentrated there but by no means confined there.\n  The supplemental security income provision, established in 1974, is \nwhat is left of President Nixon's proposal for the Family Assistance \nPlan that would have created a guaranteed level of income. I remarked \nearlier, a quarter century ago I found myself working with our \nmasterful majority leader in this purpose--the children were left out. \nBut we established a guaranteed income for the aged, the blind and \ndisabled and later expanded it greatly for children. But, basically, \nthe provision to replace AFDC with a negative income tax was dropped.\n  In the course of the 1960's we developed a new set of initiatives, in \nparticular the Economic Opportunity Act of 1965. We had learned, as a \nmatter of social inquiry, that there is just so much you can do with a \none-time survey of the population to understand the condition of that \npopulation. You can extrapolate, you can use your mathematical skills \nas much as possible, sampling and surveying periodically. But we said, \nif you are going to learn more, you are going to have to follow events \nover time. Longitudinal studies, as against vertical. The distinguished \nPresiding Officer knows those words from his experience as an applied \neconomist in the world of business. In 1968, we established the panel \nstudy of income dynamics at the University of Michigan at the Survey \nResearch Center, and they have been following a panel of actual \npersons, with names and addresses, for almost 30 years. We now know \nsomething about how people's incomes go up and down, and such.\n  A distinguished social scientist, Greg J. Duncan, at Northwestern \nUniversity and Wei-Jun Jean Yeung of the University of Michigan have \ncalculated the \n\n[[Page S19089]]\nincidence of welfare dependency in our population for the cohort, by \nwhich we mean people born, between 1973 and 1975. These people will be \njust going into their twenties and out of age of eligibility.\n  Mr. President, of the American children born from 1973 to 1975, now \njust turning 20, 24 percent had received AFDC benefits at some point \nbefore turning 18. That includes 19 percent of the white population and \n66 percent of the black population. Do not ever forget the racial \ncomponent in what we are dealing with.\n  If you include AFDC, supplemental security income, and food stamps, \nyou find that 39 percent of your children, 81 percent of African-\nAmericans and 33 percent of whites--received benefits at some point in \ntheir youth.\n  Problems of this magnitude deserve careful analysis and careful \nresponse. That is why persons whose voices have been most persuasive in \nthis debate, those asking, ``What are you doing?'' have been \nconservative social analysts, social scientists. James Q. Wilson at the \nUniversity of California, Los Angeles, for example; Lawrence Mead on \nleave at Princeton. His chair is at New York University. And George \nWill, a thoughtful conservative, who had a column when we began this \ndiscussion last September called ``Women and Children First?'' He said:\n\n       As the welfare reform debate begins to boil, the place to \n     begin is with an elemental fact: No child in America asked to \n     be here.\n\n  No child in America asked to be here.\n\n       Each was summoned into existence by the acts of adults. And \n     no child is going to be spiritually improved by being \n     collateral damage in a bombardment of severities targeted at \n     adults who may or may not deserve more severe treatment from \n     the welfare system.\n\n  We are talking about these children.\n  I ask unanimous consent that this column be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Washington Post, Sept. 14, 1995]\n\n                       Women and Children First?\n\n                          (By George F. Will)\n\n       As the welfare reform debate begins to boil, the place to \n     begin is with an elemental fact: No child in America asked to \n     be here.\n       Each was summoned into existence by the acts of adults. And \n     no child is going to be spiritually improved by being \n     collateral damage in a bombardment of severities targeted at \n     adults who may or may not deserve more severe treatment from \n     the welfare system.\n       Phil Gramm says welfare recipients are people ``in the \n     wagon'' who ought to get out and ``help the rest of us \n     pull.'' Well. Of the 14 million people receiving Aid to \n     Families with Dependent Children, 9 million are children. \n     Even if we get all these free riders into wee harnesses, the \n     wagon will not move much faster.\n       Furthermore, there is hardly an individual or industry in \n     America that is not in some sense ``in the wagon,'' receiving \n     some federal subvention. If everyone gets out, the wagon may \n     rocket along. But no one is proposing that. Instead, welfare \n     reform may give a whole new meaning to the phrase ``women and \n     children first.''\n       Marx said that history's great events appear twice, first \n     as tragedy, then as farce. Pat Moynihan worries that a \n     tragedy visited upon a vulnerable population three decades \n     ago may now recur, not as farce but again as tragedy.\n       Moynihan was there on Oct. 31, 1963, when President \n     Kennedy, in his last signing ceremony, signed legislation to \n     further the ``deinstitutionalization'' of the mentally ill. \n     Advances in psychotropic drugs, combined with ``community-\n     based programs,'' supposedly would make possible substantial \n     reductions of the populations of mental institutions.\n       But the drugs were not as effective as had been hoped, and \n     community-based programs never materialized in sufficient \n     numbers and sophistication. What materialized instead were \n     mentally ill homeless people. Moynihan warns that welfare \n     reform could produce a similar unanticipated increase in \n     children sleeping on, and freezing to death on, grates.\n       Actually, cities will have to build more grates. Here are \n     the percentages of children on AFDC at some point during 1993 \n     in five cities: Detroit (67), Philadelphia (57), Chicago \n     (46), New York (39), Los Angeles (38). ``There are,'' says \n     Moynihan, ``not enough social workers, not enough nuns, not \n     enough Salvation Army workers'' to care for children who \n     would be purged from the welfare rolls were Congress to \n     decree (as candidate Bill Clinton proposed) a two-year limit \n     for welfare eligibility.\n       Don't worry, say the designers of a brave new world, \n     welfare recipients will soon be working. However, 60 percent \n     of welfare families--usually families without fathers--have \n     children under 6 years old. Who will care for those children \n     in the year 2000 if Congress decrees that 50 percent of \n     welfare recipients must by then be in work programs? And \n     whence springs this conservative Congress's faith in work \n     programs?\n       Much of the welfare population has no family memory of \n     regular work, and little of the social capital of habits and \n     disciplines that come with work. Life in, say, Chicago's \n     Robert Taylor housing project produces what sociologist Emil \n     Durkheim called ``a dust of individuals,'' not an employable \n     population. A 1994 Columbia University study concluded that \n     most welfare mothers are negligibly educated and emotionally \n     disturbed, and 40 percent are serious drug abusers. Small \n     wonder a Congressional budget Office study estimated an \n     annual cost of $3,000 just for monitoring each worldfare \n     enrollee--in addition to the bill for training to give such \n     people elemental skills.\n       Moynihan says that a two-year limit for welfare \n     eligibility, and work requirements, might have worked 30 \n     years ago, when the nation's illegitimacy rate was 5 percent, \n     but today it is 33 percent. Don't worry, say reformers, we'll \n     take care of that by tinkering with the incentives: there \n     will be no payments for additional children born while the \n     mother is on welfare.\n       But Nicholas Eberstadt of Harvard and the American \n     enterprise Institute says: Suppose today's welfare policy \n     incentives to illegitimacy were transported back in time to \n     Salem, Mass., in 1660. How many additional illegitimate \n     births would have occurred in Puritan Salem? Few, because the \n     people of Salem in 1660 believed in hell and believed that \n     what today are called ``disorganized lifestyles'' led to \n     hell. Congress cannot legislate useful attitudes.\n       Moynihan, who spent August writing his annual book at his \n     farm in Delaware County, N.Y., notes that in 1963 that \n     county's illegitimacy rate was 3.8 percent and today is 32 \n     percent--almost exactly the national average. And no one \n     knows why the county (which is rural and 98.8 percent white) \n     or the nation has so changed.\n       Hence no one really knows what to do about it. \n     Conservatives say, well, nothing could be worse than the \n     current system. They are underestimating their ingenuity.\n\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, in our family, we have had the great privilege and joy \nsince the years of the Kennedy administration to have a home, an old \nfarmhouse on a dairy farm in up-State New York, Delaware County, where \nthe Delaware River rises. Mormonism had some of its origins on the \nbanks of the Susquehanna in our county.\n  The population of Delaware County is largely Scots, the one main \ngroup that you can identify. This was sheep raising country in the 19th \ncentury. Presbyterian churches are everywhere. It is not so very \nprosperous, but more so now than when we moved there. In 1963, 3.5 \npercent of live births in Delaware County were out of wedlock; in 1973, \n5.1; 1983, 16.6; 1993, 32.6. We are, in fact, above the national \naverage in this rural traditional society.\n  We talk so much about how the welfare system has failed. Mr. \nPresident, the welfare system reflects a much larger failure in \nAmerican society, not pervasive, but widespread, which we had evidence \nof, paid too little attention to, but still do not truly understand. It \nwill be the defining issue of this coming generation in American social \npolicy and politics.\n  There is nothing more dangerous to writer Daniel Boorstin, that most \neminent historian, former Librarian of Congress, who said that it is \nnot ignorance that is the great danger in society, it is ``the illusion \nof knowledge.'' The illusion exists where none exists. I have spent \nmuch of my lifetime on this subject and have only grown more perplexed.\n  In the Department of Labor under Presidents Kennedy and Johnson, we \nbegan the policy planning staff and picked up the earthquake that \nshuttered through the American family. We picked up the first trembles. \nIf you told me the damage would be as extensive as it is today, 30 \nyears ago if I was told what would be the case, I would have said no, \nno, it would never get that way. It has.\n  Now, we did make an effort. We did, indeed, do something very \nconsiderable, and in 1988, by a vote of 96-1, we passed out of this \nChamber the Family Support Act, which President Reagan signed in a \nwonderful ceremony. Governor Clinton was there, Governor Castle for the \nGovernors' Association, in a Rose Garden ceremony, October 13. He said:\n\n       I am pleased to sign into law today a major reform of our \n     Nation's welfare system, the Family Support Act. This bill \n     represents the culmination of more than 2 years of effort and \n     responds to the call in my 1986 State of the Union message \n     for real welfare reform--reform that will lead to lasting \n     emancipation from welfare dependency.\n\n  The act says of parents:\n\n       We expect of you what we expect of ourselves and our own \n     loved ones: that you will \n\n[[Page S19090]]\n     do your share in taking responsibility for your life and the lives of \n     the children you bring into the world.\n       First, the legislation improves our system of securing \n     support from absent parents. Secondly, it creates a new \n     emphasis on the importance of work for individuals in the \n     welfare system.\n\n  All we are saying all this year has been what President Reagan said. \nWe put that legislation into place.\n  I offered on the floor a bill to bring it up to date, the Family \nSupport Act of 1995. It got 41 votes, all, I am afraid, on this side, \nbecause both the present and previous administration, to be candid, \nhave somehow not been willing to assert what has been going on under \nthe existing statute.\n  I stood on the floor when we were debating the welfare bill and \nSenator after Senator on our side talked about the extraordinary things \ngoing on in his or her State by way of welfare changes, and none \nacknowledging that they are going on under the existing law.\n  On Wednesday, Senator James T. Fleming, a Republican, the majority \nleader of the Connecticut Senate, had an op-ed article, as we say, in \nthe New York Times, called ``Welfare in the Real World.'' He talked \nabout Connecticut's new welfare legislation, which is tough. ``It \nimposes the Nation's shortest time limit on benefits, 21 months, and \nreduces payments under the Aid to Families with Dependent Children \nprogram by an average of 7 percent.''\n  Then he goes on to complain that to do this, the State had to get a \nwaiver from Washington, which it did, particularly objecting to the \nfact that the administration has also refused to permit a two-tier \npayment system which discourages welfare migration by paying newcomers \na lower cash benefit. He says the administration desperately clings to \nthe discredited theory that Washington knows best.\n  Mr. President, I have spoken to our extraordinarily able, concerned, \nSecretary of Health and Human Services about this proposition. Why did \nyou refuse the two-tier system? And she said, because it was \nunconstitutional, that is why. We have a Constitution which provides \nthat an American citizen has equal rights with any other citizen of any \nState he or she happens to live in. That is what it means to be an \nAmerican citizen--and that Connecticut cannot say you came from New \nYork and therefore you get half of what somebody who was born here \ngets. We do not do that. That is all they did.\n  In point of fact, under the Clinton administration, 50 welfare \ndemonstration projects have been approved in 35 States; 22 States have \ntime-limited assistance in their demonstrations. This kind of \nexperimentation is going on around the country. Governors have finally \ncome to terms with the reality here. A new generation of public welfare \nofficials is learning that they are no longer dealing with the old \nsystem. Frances Perkins, who I had the privilege to know years ago, was \nSecretary of Labor when the Social Security Act was passed, which \ncreated the Aid to Families with Dependent Children program. It was \nsimply a bridge program until old age assistance matured, as there was \nold age assistance. She described a typical recipient as a West \nVirginia coal mine widow. The widow was not going to go into the coal \nmines and was not going to get into the work force.\n  A wholly new population has come on to the rolls. We know it is \nextraordinary. We have had intense efforts. Douglas Besharov describes \nthem in an article in the current issue of Public Interest, which I ask \nunanimous consent to have printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the Public Interest, Winter, 1995]\n\n                     Paternalism and Welfare Reform\n\n             (By Douglas J. Besharov and Karen N. Gardiner)\n\n       After years of collective denial, most politicians (and \n     welfare policy makers) have finally acknowledged the link \n     between unwed parenthood and long-term welfare dependency, as \n     well as a host of other social problems. But it is one thing \n     to recognize the nature of the problem and quite another to \n     develop a realistic response to it. For, truth be told, there \n     has been a fair amount of wishful thinking about what it \n     takes to help these most disadvantaged parents become self-\n     sufficient.\n       Young, unwed parents are extremely difficult to help. \n     Besides living in deeply impoverished neighborhoods with few \n     social (or familial) supports, many suffer severe educational \n     deficits and are beset by multiple personal problems, from \n     high levels of clinical depression to alcohol and drug abuse. \n     As a result, even richly funded programs have had little \n     success with these mothers; and they rarely, if ever, try to \n     reach the fathers.\n       The best remedy, of course, would be to prevent unwed \n     parenthood in the first place. But, even if the number of \n     out-of-wedlock births were somehow reduced by half, there \n     would still be over 600,000 such births each year. Thus \n     social programs must do a much better job of improving the \n     life prospects of unwed mothers and their children (without, \n     of course, creating more incentives for them to become unwed \n     mothers). This will require de-emphasizing the voluntary \n     approaches of the past that have proven unsuccessful, and, in \n     their place, pursuing promising new policies that are more \n     paternalistic.\n\n\n                        unwed mothers on welfare\n\n       In the last four decades, the proportion of American \n     children born out of wedlock has increased more than \n     sevenfold, from 4 percent in 1950 to 31 percent in 1993. In \n     that year, 1.2 million children were born outside of \n     marriage. These children, and their mothers, comprise the \n     bulk of long-term welfare dependents.\n       Images of Murphy Brown notwithstanding, the vast majority \n     of out-of-wedlock births are to lower-income women: nearly \n     half are to women with annual family incomes below $10,000; \n     more than 70 percent are to women in families earning less \n     than $20,000. In Addition, most unmarried mothers are young \n     (66 percent of all out-of-wedlock births were to 15- to 24-\n     year-olds in 1988), poorly educated (only 57 percent have a \n     high-school diploma), and unlikely to have work experience \n     (only 28 percent worked full time and an additional 8 percent \n     part time in 1990).\n       Consequently, most unwed mothers go on welfare. In \n     Illinois, for example, over 70 percent of all unwed mothers \n     go on welfare within five years of giving birth to a child. \n     Nation-wide, an unmarried woman who has a baby in her early \n     twenties is more than twice as likely to go on welfare within \n     five years than is a married teen mother (63 percent versus \n     26 percent). And, once on welfare, unwed mothers tend to stay \n     there. According to Harvard's David Ellwood, who served as \n     one of President Clinton's chief welfare advisors, the \n     average never-married mother spends almost a decade on \n     welfare, twice as long as divorced mothers, the other major \n     group on welfare.\n       Unwed parenthood among teenagers is a particularly serious \n     problem. Between 1960 and 1993, the proportion of out-of-\n     wedlock births among teenagers rose from 15 percent to 71 \n     percent, with the absolute number of out-of-wedlock births \n     rising from 89,000 to 369,000.\n       Teen mothers are now responsible for about 30 percent of \n     all out-of-wedlock births, but even this understates the \n     impact of unwed teen parenthood on the nation's illegitimacy \n     problem. Sixty percent of all out-of-wedlock births involve \n     mothers who had their first babies as teenagers.\n       Because so many unwed teen mothers have dropped out of \n     school and have poor earnings prospects in general, they are \n     even more likely to become long-term welfare recipients. \n     Families begun by teenagers (married or unmarried) account \n     for the majority of welfare expenditures in this country. \n     According to Kristin Moore, executive director of Child \n     Trends, Inc., 59 percent of women currently receiving Aid to \n     Families with Dependent Children (AFDC) were 19 years old or \n     younger when they had their first child.\n       These realities have changed the face of welfare. In 1940, \n     shortly after AFDC was established as part of the Social \n     Security Act of 1935, about one-third of the children \n     entering the program were eligible because of a deceased \n     parent, about one-third because of an incapacitated parent, \n     and about one-third because of another reason for absence \n     (including divorce, separation, or no marriage tie). By 1961, \n     the children of widows accounted for only 7 percent of the \n     caseload, while those of divorced or separated and never-\n     married mothers had climbed to 39 percent and 20 percent, \n     respectively. In 1993, the children of never-married mothers \n     made up the largest proportion of the caseload, 55 percent, \n     compared to children of widows (1 percent) and divorced or \n     separated parents (29 percent).\n       The face of welfare dependency has changed for many and \n     infinitely complex reasons. But there should be no denying \n     that the inability of most unwed mothers to earn as much as \n     their welfare package is a major reason why they go on \n     welfare--and stay there for so long. (A common route off \n     welfare is marriage, but that is a subject for another \n     article.) Hence, since the 1960s, most attempts to reduce \n     welfare dependency have focused on raising the earnings \n     capacity of young mothers through a combination of \n     educational and job-training efforts. Given the faith \n     Americans have in education as the great social equalizer, \n     this emphasis has been entirely understandable. However, the \n     evaluations of three major demonstration projects serve as an \n     unambiguous warning that a new approach is needed.\n\n\n                          three demonstrations\n\n       Beginning in the late 1980s, three large-scale \n     demonstration projects designed to reduce welfare dependency \n     were launched. Although the projects had somewhat different \n\n[[Page S19091]]\n     approaches, they all sought to foster self-sufficiency through a \n     roughly similar combination of education, training, various \n     health-related services, counseling, and, in two of the \n     three, family planning.\n       New Chance tried to avert long-term welfare recipiency by \n     enhancing the ``human capital'' of young, welfare-dependent \n     mothers. Designed and evaluated by Manpower Demonstration \n     Research Corporation (MDRC), the program targeted those at \n     especially high risk of long-term dependency: young welfare \n     recipients (ages 16 to 22) who had their first child as a \n     teenager and were also high-school dropouts. Its two-stage \n     program attempted to remedy the mothers' severe educational \n     deficits--primarily through the provision of a Graduate \n     Equivalency Degree (GED) and building specific job-related \n     skills.\n       The Teen Parent Demonstration attempted to use education \n     and training services to increase the earnings potential of \n     teen mothers before patterns of dependency took root. \n     Evaluated by Mathematical Policy Research, the program \n     required all first-time teen mothers in Camden and Newark, \n     New Jersey, and the south side of Chicago, Illinois, to \n     enroll when they first applied for welfare. The program \n     enforced its mandate by punishing a mother's truancy through \n     a reduction in her welfare grant.\n       The Comprehensive Child Development Program (CCDP), which \n     is still operating, seeks to break patterns of \n     intergenerational poverty by providing an enriched \n     developmental experience for children and educational \n     services to their parents. A planned five-year intervention \n     is designed to enhance the intellectual, social, and physical \n     development of children from age one until they enter school. \n     Although not a requirement for participation, the majority of \n     families are headed by single parents. The program, evaluated \n     by Abt Associates, also provides classes on parenting, \n     reading, and basic skills (including GED preparation), as \n     well as other activities to promote self-sufficiency.\n       These three projects represent a major effort to break the \n     cycle of poverty and to reduce welfare dependency. New Chance \n     involved 1,500 families at 16 sites and cost about $5,100 per \n     participant for the first stage, $1,300 for the second, and \n     $2,500 for child care (for an 18-month total of about $9,000 \n     per participant). The Teen Parent Demonstration, involving \n     2,700 families at three sites, was the least expensive at \n     $1,400 per participant per year. The most expensive is the \n     CCDP, which serves 2,200 families at 24 sites for $10,000 per \n     family per year. Since it is intended to follow families for \n     five years, the total cost is planned to be about $50,000 per \n     family. These costs are in addition to the standard welfare \n     package, which averages about $8,300 per year for AFDC, food \n     stamps, and so forth.\n       All three projects served populations predominantly \n     comprised of teen mothers and those who had been teens when \n     they first gave birth. The average age at first birth was 17 \n     for New Chance and Teen Parent Demonstration clients, while \n     half of the CCDP clients were in their teens when they first \n     gave birth. As the project evaluators soon found, this is an \n     extremely disadvantaged--and difficult to reach--population. \n     Over 60 percent of Teen Parent Demonstration and New Chance \n     clients grew up in families that had received AFDC at some \n     point in the past. If anything, early parenthood worsened \n     their financial situations. All Teen Parent Demonstration \n     clients, of course, were on welfare, as were 95 percent of \n     those in New Chance. The average annual income for CCDP \n     families was $5,000.\n       The mothers also suffered from substantial educational \n     deficiencies. Although most were in their late teens or early \n     twenties, few had high-school diplomas or GEDs. Many of those \n     still in school (in the Teen Parent Demonstration) were \n     behind by a grade. In New Chance and the Teen Parent \n     Demonstration, the average mother was reading at the eighth-\n     grade level. Their connections to the labor market were \n     tenuous at best. Almost two-thirds of the New Chance \n     participants had not worked in the year prior to enrollment, \n     and 60 percent had never held a job for more than six months. \n     Only half of Teen Parent Demonstration mothers had ever had a \n     job. These young mothers also had a variety of emotional or \n     personal problems. About half of New Chance clients and about \n     40 percent of those in CCDP were diagnosed as suffering \n     clinical depression. The mothers also reported problems with \n     drinking and drug abuse. Many were physically abused by \n     boyfriends.\n\n\n                         Disappointing results\n\n       Besides the intensity of the intervention, what set these \n     three demonstrations apart from past efforts is that they \n     were rigorously evaluated using random assignment to \n     treatment and control groups. Random-assignment evaluations \n     are especially important in this area because, at first \n     glance, projects like these often look successful. For \n     example, one demonstration site announced that it was \n     successful because half of its clients had left welfare, and \n     their earnings and rate of employment had both doubled. These \n     results sound impressive, but the relevant policy question \n     is: What would have happened in the absence of the project? \n     This is called the ``counterfactual,'' and it is the essence \n     of judging the worth of a particular intervention.\n       Unfortunately, despite the effort expended, none of these \n     demonstrations came anywhere near achieving its goals. After \n     the intervention, the families in the control groups (which \n     received no special services, but often did receive services \n     outside of the demonstrations) were doing about as well, and \n     sometimes better, than those in the demonstrations. In other \n     words, the evaluations were unable to document any \n     substantial differences in the lives of the families served. \n     Here is a sample of their disappointing findings:\n\n\n                           welfare recipiency\n\n       All three evaluations were unanimous: Participants were as \n     likely to remain on welfare as those in the control groups. \n     Robert Granger, senior vice president of MDRC, summed up the \n     interim evaluation of New Chance: ``This program at this \n     particular point has not made people better off \n     economically.'' At the end of 18 months, 82 percent of New \n     Chance clients were on welfare compared to 81 percent of the \n     control group. The Teen Parent Demonstration mothers did not \n     fare any better. After two years, 71 percent were receiving \n     AFDC, only slightly fewer than the control group (72.5 \n     percent). CCDP participants were actually 5 percent more \n     likely to have received welfare in the past year than were \n     those in the control group (66 percent versus 63 percent).\n\n\n                           earnings and work\n\n       Only the Teen Parent Demonstration program saw any gains in \n     employment. Its mothers were 12 percent more likely to be \n     employed sometime during the two years after the program \n     began (48 percent of the treatment group versus 43 percent of \n     the control group) and, as a result, averaged $23 per month \n     more in income. In most cases, however, employment did not \n     permanently end their welfare dependency. Nearly one in three \n     of those who left AFDC for work returned within six months, \n     44 percent within a year, and 65 percent within three years.\n       The other programs did not show even this small gain. Fewer \n     New Chance clients were employed during the evaluation period \n     than controls (43 percent versus 45 percent), in part because \n     they were in classes during some of the period. Those who did \n     work tended to work for a short time, usually less than three \n     months. Given the lower level of work, New Chance clients had \n     earned 25 percent less than the control group at the time of \n     the evaluation ($1,366 versus $1,708 a year). Only 29 percent \n     of the CCDP mothers were working at the time of the two-year \n     evaluation, the same proportion as the control group; there \n     was no difference in the number of hours worked per week, the \n     wages earned per week, or the number of months spent working.\n\n\n                         education and training\n\n       All three demonstrations were relatively successful in \n     enrolling mothers in education programs. Teen Parent \n     Demonstration mothers were over 40 percent more likely to be \n     in school (41 percent versus 29 percent), and about one-third \n     of the CCDP clients were working towards a degree, 78 percent \n     more than the control group.\n       About three-quarters more New Chance participants received \n     their GED than their control-group counterparts (37 percent \n     versus 21 percent). But the mothers' receiving a GED did not \n     seem to raise their employability--or functional literacy. \n     The average reading level of the New Chance Mothers remained \n     unchanged (eighth grade) and was identical to that of the \n     control group. This finding echoes those from evaluations of \n     other programs with similar goals, including the Department \n     of Education's Even Start program. Jean Layzer, senior \n     associate at Abt Associates, concluded that, rather than \n     honing reading, writing, and math skills, GED classes tended \n     to focus on test-taking: ``What people did was memorize what \n     they needed to know for the GED. They think that their goal \n     is the GED because they think it will get them a job. But it \n     won't--it won't give them the skills to read an ad in the \n     newspaper.''\n       In this light, it is especially troubling that, while \n     increasing the number of GED recipients, New Chance seems to \n     have reduced the number of young mothers who actually \n     finished high school (6 percent versus 9 percent). According \n     to one evaluator, the projects may have legitimated a young \n     mother's opting for a GED rather than returning to high \n     school.\n\n\n                           subsequent births\n\n       Although the young mothers in New Chance and the Teen \n     Parent Demonstration said they wanted to delay or forego \n     future childbearing, the majority experienced a repeat \n     pregnancy within the evaluation period, and most opted to \n     give birth. Mothers in one project spent only 1.5 hours on \n     family planning, while they spent 54 hours in another, with \n     no discernible difference in impact.\n       All New Chance sites offered family-planning classes and \n     life skills courses that sought to empower women to take \n     control of their fertility. Many also dispensed \n     contraceptives. In the Teen Parent Demonstration, the family \n     planning workshop was mandatory. Despite these efforts, over \n     7 percent more New Chance mothers experienced a pregnancy (57 \n     percent versus 53 percent). One-fourth of both Teen Parent \n     Demonstration clients and the control group experienced a \n     pregnancy within one year; half of each group did so by the \n     two-year follow-up. Two-thirds of all pregnancies resulted in \n     births. Although it was hoped that the CCDP intervention \n     would reduced subsequent births, this was not an explicit \n     goal of the demonstration; nor was family planning a core \n     service provided by the sites. But, \n\n[[Page S19092]]\n     again, there was no real difference between experimental and control \n     groups: 30 percent of mothers in both had had another birth \n     by the two-year follow-up.\n\n\n                          Maternal depression\n\n       Two of the projects, New Chance and CCDP, attempted to \n     lessen the high rates of clinical depression among the \n     mothers. All New Chance sites provided mental-health \n     services, most often through referrals to other agencies \n     (although the quality of such services differed by site). Yet \n     program participants were as likely as those in the control \n     group to be clinically depressed (44 percent). CCDP clients \n     likewise received mental-health services as needed. But, \n     again, there was no discernible impact. Two years into the \n     program, 42 percent of the mothers in both the program and \n     control groups were determined to be at risk of clinical \n     depression. Measures of self-esteem and the use of social \n     supports also showed no differences.\n\n\n                  Child development and child rearing\n\n       The CCDP sought to prevent later educational failure by \n     providing five years of developmental, psychological, \n     medical, and social services to a group of children who \n     entered the program as infants. Developmental screening and \n     assessments were compulsory for all the children; those at \n     risk of being developmentally delayed were referred to \n     intervention programs.\n       A major CCDP goal was to improve the ability of the parents \n     to nurture and educate their children. But, at the end of the \n     first two years, the evaluation found only scattered short-\n     term effects on measures of good parenting, such as time \n     spent with the child, the parent's teaching skills, \n     expectations for the child's success, attitudes about child \n     rearing, and nurturing parent-child interactions. More \n     disheartening, especially given the success of other early \n     intervention programs, CCDP had small or no effect on the \n     development of the children in the program. Participating \n     children scored slightly higher on a test of cognitive \n     development but about the same in terms of social withdrawal, \n     depression, aggression, or destructiveness. They were only \n     slightly more likely to have their immunizations up to date \n     (88 percent versus 83 percent). CCDP's lack of success may be \n     explained by its approach to child development (delivering \n     about one hour per week of early childhood education through \n     in-home visits by case managers or, some-times, early-\n     childhood-development specialists), which did not focus large \n     amounts of resources squarely on children.\n       All in all, it's a sad story. But what is most discouraging \n     about these results is that the projects, particularly New \n     Chance and CCDP, enjoyed high levels of funding, yet still \n     seemed unable to improve the lives of disadvantaged families. \n     There are several explanations for their poor performance: \n     Many of the project sites had no prior experience providing \n     such a complex set of services; some were poorly managed; and \n     almost all were plagued with the problems that typically \n     characterize demonstration projects, such as slow start-ups, \n     inexperienced personnel, and high staff turnover. In \n     addition, the projects often chose the wrong objectives and \n     tactics. For example, most focused on helping the mothers \n     obtain GEDs, even in the face of accumulating evidence that \n     the GED does not increase employability. As for the two \n     programs that attempted to reduce subsequent births, program \n     staff tried to walk a fine line between promoting the \n     postponement of births and not devaluing the women's role as \n     mothers. Their sessions on family planning seemed to have \n     emphasized that the mothers should decide whether or not to \n     have additional children--rather than that they should avoid \n     having another child until they are self-sufficient.\n       But even such major weaknesses do not explain the dearth of \n     positive impacts across so many goals--and so many sites. One \n     would expect some signs of improvement in the treatment group \n     if the projects had at least been on the right track. Hence, \n     one is impelled to another explanation: The underlying \n     strategy may be wrong. Voluntary education and job-training \n     programs may simply be unable to help enough unwed mothers \n     escape long-term dependency.\n\n\n                          from carrot to stick\n\n       Young mothers volunteered for both New Chance and the CCDP; \n     no one required that they participate. That level of \n     motivation should have given both projects an advantage in \n     helping them break patterns of dependency. As social workers \n     joke, you only need one social worker to change a light bulb, \n     but it helps to have a bulb that really wants to be changed.\n       In both New Chance and the CCDP, however, initial \n     motivation was not enough to overcome decades of personal, \n     family, and neighborhood dysfunction. In relatively short \n     order, there was serious attrition. New Chance, for example, \n     was designed as a five-days-a-week, six-hours-a-day program. \n     Yet, over the first 18 months, the young mothers averaged \n     only 298 hours of participation, a mere 13 percent of the \n     time available to them. CCDP experienced similar attrition. \n     Although clients were asked to make a five-year commitment to \n     the program, 35 percent quit after the end of the second year \n     and 45 percent after the end of the fourth.\n       These dropout rates make all the more significant the Teen \n     Parent Demonstration's success at enrolling non-volunteers. \n     Participation was mandatory for all first-time mothers and \n     was enforced through the threat of a reduction in welfare \n     benefits equal to the mother's portion of the grant, about \n     $160 per month. When teen mothers first applied for welfare, \n     they received a notice telling them that they had to register \n     for the program and that nonparticipation would result in a \n     financial sanction. Registration involved a meeting with \n     program staff and a basic-skills test. Over 30 percent came \n     to the program after receiving this initial notice. Another \n     52 percent came in after receiving a letter warning of a \n     possible reduction of their welfare grant.\n       The 18 percent who failed to respond to the second notice \n     saw their welfare checks cut. Of these, about one-third (6 \n     percent of the total sample) eventually participated. As one \n     mother recounted, ``The first time they sent me a letter, I \n     looked at it and threw it away. The second time, I looked at \n     it and threw it away again. And then they cut my check, and I \n     said `Uh, oh, I'd better go.' '' Thus sanctions brought in an \n     entire cohort of teen mothers--from the most motivated to the \n     least motivated and most troubled. For example, no exceptions \n     were made for alcoholic and drug-addicted mothers.\n       Moreover, the Teen Parent Demonstration was able to keep \n     this population of non-volunteers participating at levels \n     similar to the volunteers in New Chance and the CCDP. After \n     registration, the mothers were required to attend workshops, \n     high-school classes, and other education and training \n     programs. In any given month, participation averaged about 50 \n     percent, reaching a high of about 65 percent during the \n     period when the projects were fully operational. Sanctioning \n     was not uncommon: Almost two-thirds of the participants \n     received formal warnings, and 36 percent had their grants \n     reduced for at least one month.\n\n\n                            More tough love\n\n       Voluntary educational and training programs can play an \n     important role in helping those welfare mothers (often older \n     and divorced) who want to improve their situations. But, by \n     themselves, they seem unable to motivate the majority of \n     young, unwed mothers to overcome their distressingly \n     dysfunctional situations. Mandatory approaches are attractive \n     to the public and to policy makers because they seem to do \n     just that. In the ``learnfare'' component of Ohio's Learning, \n     Earning, and parenting Program (LEAP), AFDC recipients who \n     were under the age of 20 and did not have a high-school \n     diploma or GED were required to attend school. Those who \n     failed to attend school or did not attend an initial \n     assessment interview had their welfare grant reduced by $62 \n     per month. This penalty continued until the mother complied \n     with the program's rules. Conversely, those who attended \n     school regularly got a $62 per month bonus. Thus the monthly \n     benefit for a ten with one child was almost 60 percent higher \n     for those who complied with the program ($336 versus $212). \n     The program also provided limited counseling and child care. \n     Based on a random assignment methodology, MDRC's evaluation \n     found that, one year after LEAP began, almost 20 percent more \n     LEAP participants than controls remained in school \n     continuously or graduated (61 percent versus 51 percent). \n     Over 40 percent more returned to school after dropping out \n     (47 percent versus 33 percent).\n       Despite early concerns, such behavior-related rules have \n     not been burdensome to administer. Most have been implemented \n     without creating new bureaucracies or new problems. According \n     to MDRCC's Robert Granger, these ``large-scale programs have \n     not been expensive.'' The cost of the LEAP program in \n     Cleveland, for example, was about $540 per client per year, \n     of which about $350 was for case management and $190 for \n     child care.\n       Nor do such rules seem unduly harsh on clients. The \n     sanctioning in the Teen Parent Demonstration caused little \n     discernible dislocation among the young mothers. In fact, \n     very few of them were continuously sanctioned (and, besides, \n     the sanction was applied against only the mothers' portion of \n     the grant). Rebecca Maynard, the director of the Mathematica \n     evaluation, found that the ``clear message from both the \n     young mothers and the case managers is that the financial \n     penalties are fair and effective in changing the culture of \n     welfare from both sides.'' Clients viewed the demonstration \n     program as supportive, although also serious and demanding. \n     Case managers believe it motivated both clients and service \n     providers. Similarly, the LEAP sanctions caused ``no hardship \n     whatsoever to the vase majority of participants and their \n     children,'' according to David Long of MDRC, a co-author of \n     the evaluation report. Mothers who had been sanctioned \n     reported that they were able to ``get by'' either by trimming \n     their budgets or by receiving assistance from others.\n       The early success of such experiments linking reductions \n     (and increases) in welfare to particular behaviors led (as of \n     May 1995) more than two-thirds of the state to adopt, and \n     another nine to propose, one or more behavior-related welfare \n     rules. (State reforms are authorized by a federal law that \n     allows the Secretary of Health and Human Services to \n     ``waive'' certain federal rules.) Between 1992 and 1995, 21 \n     states adopted learnfare-type programs, which tie welfare \n     payments to school attendance for AFDC children or teen \n     parents (with federal waivers pending in three more); eight \n     states adopted ``family caps'' that deny additional benefits \n     to women who have more children while on welfare (with \n     waivers pending in six more); 15 states adopted time limits \n     for receiving benefits (with waivers pending in nine more); \n     and 10 states adopted immunization requirements (with waivers \n     pending in three more). \n\n[[Page S19093]]\n     In the coming years, expect more states to adopt such rules--and expect \n     more behaviors to become the subject of such rules.\n       This attempt to regulate the behavior of welfare recipients \n     is a sharp break from the hands-off policy of the past 30 \n     years--and an implicit rejection of past voluntary education \n     and training efforts. It was not so long ago that people such \n     as Princeton's Lawrence Mead were widely derided for \n     suggesting that welfare is not simply a right but an \n     obligation that should be contingent upon certain \n     constructive behaviors. But, because of both political and \n     practical experience, they are now in the mainstream of \n     current developments.\n\n\n                          the limits of reform\n\n       No one, however, should expect such paternalistic welfare \n     policies to eradicate dependency. Our political system is \n     unlikely to adopt rules and sanctions tough enough to \n     motivate the hardest-to-reach mothers--nor should it. No \n     politician really wants tough welfare rules that result in \n     large numbers of homeless families living on the streets. \n     Although those who remain on welfare should feel the pinch of \n     benefit reductions, they nevertheless need to be protected \n     from hunger, homelessness, and other harmful deprivations. \n     Thus there is a political limit to the amount of behavioral \n     change that financial sanctions might potentially achieve.\n       Hence, in the coming years, states will have to grapple \n     with issues such as: How many behaviors can be subject to \n     regulation? How much can the sanctions be stiffened before \n     becoming punitive (and counterproductive)? How should \n     agencies handle clients who, because of emotional problems or \n     substance abuse, seem unable to respond to financial \n     incentives?\n       Even the experts can only guess about the impact of future \n     rules. The jury is still out, for example, about the impact \n     of New Jersey's family cap; and time-limited programs have \n     yet to be tested in the ``real world.'' Just as important, no \n     sanctioning scheme can compensate for the inadequacy of \n     existing programs for low-skilled and poorly motivated \n     mothers. Programs need to hold out a palpable promise of \n     higher earnings, otherwise participants will drop out--even \n     in the face of financial sanctions. New Chance, the Teen \n     Parent Demonstration, and CCDP all had high dropout rates, \n     suggesting that they failed the consumer test. Describing the \n     services available to the Teen Parent Demonstration, Maynard \n     says: ``We did not have much to offer. We had lousy public \n     schools, boring and irrelevant GED programs, and very caring \n     case managers.''\n       Current approaches need to be fundamentally rethought. For \n     example, many welfare experts now believe that education in \n     basic skills is less effective than simply pushing recipients \n     toward work. A recently released evaluation of welfare-reform \n     programs in three sites (Atlanta, Georgia, Grand Rapids, \n     Michigan, and Riverside, California) by MDRC found that \n     intensive education and training activities were only about \n     one-third as effective in moving recipients off welfare as \n     what it called ``rapid job entry'' strategies (6 percent \n     versus 16 percent).\n       ``The mothers were taught how to look for work and how to \n     sell themselves to employers,'' according to Judith Gueron of \n     MDRC. ``The focus was on how to prepare a resume, pursue job \n     leads, handle interviews, and hold a job once you got one.'' \n     The programs also maintained telephone banks from which \n     recipients could call prospective employers. And, she \n     stresses, ``The program was very mandatory, backed up with \n     heavy grants reductions for mothers who did not comply with \n     job search requirements.'' Institutionalizing such programs \n     and developing others in all parts of the country will \n     require creativity, clarity of purpose, and patience, and \n     much trial and error. Still, success will be elusive.\n       Even if behavior-related rules do not sharply reduce \n     welfare rolls, they could still serve an important and \n     constructive purpose. The social problems associated with \n     long-term welfare dependence cannot be addressed without \n     first putting the brakes on the downward spirals of \n     dysfunctional behavior common among so many recipients. Thus \n     it would be achievement enough if such rules could stabilize \n     home situations. Given the failure of voluntary approaches, \n     the accomplishment of that alone would at least provide a \n     base for other, more targeted approaches.\n       Aristotle is credited with the aphorism: ``Virtue is \n     habit.'' To him, the moral virtues (including wisdom, \n     justice, temperance, and courage), what people now tend to \n     call ``character,'' were not inbred. Aristotle believed that \n     they develop in much the same way people learn to play a \n     musical instrument, through endless practice. In other words, \n     character is built by the constant repetition of divers good \n     acts. These new behavior-related welfare rules are an \n     attempt, long overdue in the minds of many, to build habits \n     of responsible behavior among long-term recipients; that is, \n     to legislate virtue.\n\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. I am coming to a close. The three demonstration \nprojects of intense efforts for young, unmarried mothers, training \nthem, stimulating them, encouraging them, reassuring them--it is so \nhard. If we knew how hard it was, we would know what we are putting at \nrisk here. We are abandoning the national commitment to solve a \nnational problem. We are doing it with very little understanding, very \nlittle understanding.\n  I have here, Mr. President, and I will close with these remarks--we \nare getting used to everyone who comes to the Senate floor having a \nposter--I have an artifact. Give this a little thought, just a little \nthought. What I am holding is a pen with which John F. Kennedy, in his \nlast public bill signing ceremony at the White House, October 31, 1963, \nsigned the Mental Retardation Facilities and Community Health Centers \nConstruction Act of 1963. I was there. I had worked on the legislation. \nHe gave me a pen.\n\n  In that act we undertook what was known as the deinstitutionalization \nof our great mental institutions. We developed tranquilizers, first in \nNew York State, at Rockland State Hospital. We again used them \nsystemwide. We thought we had a medication for schizophrenia. We \nthought it could be treated in the community, perhaps more effectively \nin the community than in a large mental institution. So we were going \nto build 2,000 community mental health centers by the year 1980. And \nthen, thereafter 1 per 100,000.\n  President Kennedy was very deeply interested in this. I have always \nthought, if some person with wonderful fast-forward vision was in the \nOval Office at that moment and said, ``Mr. President, before you sign \nthat bill could I tell you we are going to empty out our mental \ninstitutions. In 30 years time they will have about 7 percent of the \npopulation in this time. We are only going to build about 600 of these \ncommunity mental health centers. Then we are going to forget we started \nthat and go on to other things and leave it be.'' I think the President \nwould have put that pen down. I think he would have put that pen down \nand said, ``What, do you want people sleeping on grates on Constitution \nAvenue? Sleeping in doorways? In cities around the country, \nschizophrenic persons with no medication, no location, simply cast onto \nthe streets?'' He would have said, ``They will be called homeless or \nsomething?''\n  I think he would not have signed the bill. I wish he had not. And \nthat is why I am so pleased to say that President Clinton will veto \nthis bill. And then we can get back together, work together for the \nnext stage in what has to be a national effort for an extraordinarily \nsevere national problem.\n  Mr. President, I see my friend from North Carolina is on the floor \nbut I yield the floor. I thank the Chair for his courtesy.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I yield 10 minutes to my distinguished \ncolleague from North Carolina.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Carolina.\n  Mr. FAIRCLOTH. Mr. President, I have, many times over the course of \nthis session's welfare reform debate stated that it is my strong belief \nthat unless we address the root cause of welfare dependency--\nillegitimacy--we will not truly reform our welfare system. And my \nbelief in this principle has become stronger and strengthened by the \ntwists and turns of almost a year of debate.\n  It is with mixed feelings that I rise to discuss this conference \nreport on welfare reform. I am pleased that many of the weak points of \nour first Senate bills have been strengthened. This conference report \ncontains important provisions to require real work from welfare \nrecipients, a concept known as ``pay-for-performance.'' This means that \nwelfare recipients will only receive benefits as compensation for work \ndone. While this commonsense principle is the undisputed standard in \nthe private sector, can you believe it is a revolutionary thing for the \nGovernment to expect work for pay? ``Pay-for-performance'' requirements \nare the key to replacing welfare with workfare.\n  I am also glad to see that the welfare conference report contains \nwhat has come to be called the family cap. Middle-class American \nfamilies who want to have children have to plan for, prepare, and save \nmoney, because they understand the serious responsibility involved in \nbringing children into the world. It is grossly unfair to ask these \nsame people to send their hard-earned tax dollars to support the \nreckless and irresponsible behavior of a woman who has a child out of \nwedlock and continues to have them, expecting support from the American \ntaxpayer. In fact, their sole support would be the American taxpayer. \n\n[[Page S19094]]\n\n  The family cap sends an important message that higher standards of \npersonal responsibility will be expected of welfare recipients. If this \nconference report becomes law, welfare recipients will no longer \nreceive automatic increases in their benefits when they have additional \nchildren.\n  I am very disappointed that the conference was unable to follow \nthrough on the courage and fortitude shown by our colleagues in the \nHouse of Representatives, who passed a welfare reform bill which would \nhave prohibited the use of block grant funds for cash payments to unwed \nmothers under 18. In place of this crucial provision we merely have a \nstatement that options exist for the States. We need much more.\n  This is little more than a statement of current policy. And current \npolicy has resulted in an out-of-wedlock birth rate which has \nquadrupled over the last 30 years. Today, more than one in every three \nAmerican children is born out of wedlock. And in some communities, the \nillegitimacy rate approaches 80 percent.\n  Children born out of wedlock are three times more likely to be on \nwelfare when they become adults--three times more likely. Furthermore, \nchildren raised in single-parent homes are six times more likely to be \npoor, and twice as likely to commit crime and end up in jail.\n  In fact, a young girl who is born out of wedlock, when she reaches \nearly maturity is 164 percent more likely to herself have a child out \nof wedlock.\n  To truly reform welfare we must reverse current welfare policies \nwhich subsidize, and thus promote, self-destructive behavior and \nillegitimacy--policies which are destroying the American family. This \nlegislation fails to take this crucial step.\n  It is also unfortunate that this conference report fails to make \nmajor changes in the way welfare is administered at the Federal level. \nEven though this legislation will block grant the AFDC program, and \nseveral other smaller programs, it still leaves in place a structure of \ntoo many bureaucrats running too many programs through too many \ndifferent agencies. This bureaucratic structure will continue to stop \nand stifle substantial reform.\n  Mr. President, in spite of these deficiencies, the welfare reform \nconference report before us does mark a turning point in the attitude \nwhich prevails here in Washington, and is reflective of the attitude \nthat prevails around the country and that is that it is past time that \nwe do something.\n  Finally, we have legislation that recognizes what many of us on this \nside have known for so long. All of our problems cannot be solved by \nmore Government programs and more spending. Government spending is no \nsubstitute for personal responsibility.\n  This legislation is also significant as a step in the right direction \nafter 30 years of failed welfare policies--30 years of them. But, Mr. \nPresident, it is only a very small step in comparison to the enormity \nof the problem our current welfare system has produced. And our current \nwelfare system has produced, with $5 trillion of our dollars, the \nsituation we find ourselves in today.\n  Mr. President, if this legislation does pass, it should not be taken \nas an excuse to rest, or to rest on any laurels from it. This \nlegislation should serve as a start, to push ahead on the vast \nremainder of unfinished welfare reform business. The real work of \nwelfare reform is still to be done, but this is a start.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, on behalf of the floor manager for the \nminority, I yield 15 minutes to the distinguished Senator from \nIllinois.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. Thank you very much, Mr. President.\n  Mr. President, it is with sadness that I rise today to discuss the \nconference report on H.R. 4.\n  It is 4 days before Christmas, the season usually characterized by \ngiving and good will. But here we are in this Congress in the middle of \na partial Government shutdown considering legislation that will \ndismantle the Federal safety net for poor families and, in the process, \npush over 1 million additional children into grinding poverty.\n  Mr. President, it seems to me that too many of our colleagues have \nforgotten the lesson that Dr. Seuss tried to teach us in ``The Grinch \nWho Stole Christmas.'' Not only are their hearts too small, but their \nvision is too narrow as well.\n  We are, Mr. President, a national community--as Americans --the \nconditions in which the poor live, especially the poor children, affect \nus all no matter our wealth or where we happen to live in this great \ncountry.\n  I have in my years in public life advocated making welfare work \nbetter. In fact, earlier this year I introduced a welfare bill that I \nbelieve addressed the critical problems entrenched in our current \nsystem; lack of incentives to move from welfare to work and lack of \njobs in low-income communities to absorb those people who want to work.\n  Mr. President, that bill acknowledged that changes are needed, and it \nalso incorporated lessons that the States have learned--particularly \nthose States that have already instituted successful reform. Those \nStates have shown us that you cannot reform welfare on the cheap.\n  This bill ignores that experience altogether. Welfare reform should \ncenter on eliminating the incentives for dependency on building strong, \ntwo-parent families and moving recipients into the economic mainstream.\n  The Senate bill, though better than the House effort, did not \naccomplish those objectives, and this conference report is even worse. \nReform may be needed, but not shortsighted reform.\n  I support increased State flexibility, experimentation, and positive \nand constructive change. But this bill will lead to a complete \nabandonment of any national commitment to poor families. There is room \nfor a shared Federal-State partnership, but this bill gives us no \npartnership at all but simply envisions the Federal Government as the \ncheck writer of last resort. There is no accountability for the money. \nThere is no accountability for the rules nor for the money, and the \nbill encourages a race to the bottom among the States with the States \ndoing the least, potentially hurting the poor the most. There is no \nrecognition in this legislation that as a national community we must \nhave a national safety net if poverty is not to become an accident of \ngeography.\n  In addition to dismantling the Federal safety net, this bill is \nflawed in a number of other ways.\n  The plan makes a mockery of the goal to move welfare recipients into \nprivate sector jobs.\n  The Congressional Budget Office, which has gotten a lot of support \naround these quarters in recent times, in discussions on the budget, \nhas reported time and time again that the funding levels in this bill \nare inadequate to meet the work requirements. In fact, the \nCongressional Budget Office assumes that most States will fail to meet \nthose work requirements and, therefore, will incur substantial \npenalties under the terms of the legislation.\n  If only 10 to 15 States--which is the estimate of the number of \nStates that might meet the work requirements--if only 10 meet those \nwork requirements, what of the other 40? What will be the ramifications \nfor them?\n  Several studies, including one by Northern Illinois University, have \nshown that, even if the States could meet the work requirements in this \nlegislation, the private sector job market cannot, at the present time, \nabsorb all of the new workers entering the system. Half of the adults \nreceiving AFDC in Chicago right now have never graduated from high \nschool. And one-third of them have never held a job.\n  This conference report will seal the doom of many of these people for \nwhom it will be difficult, if not impossible, to employ without \nappropriate support services, education, job training, and assistance--\nthat is nowhere provided for in this legislation.\n  The plan also cuts funding and block grants critical child welfare \nprograms. Mr. President, this is the last place where we should be \nmaking cuts. Our child protection system is already overburdened and \nunderfunded. I can think of no more vulnerable population than abused \nchildren, and there have been, frankly, far too many heart-wrenching, \nalarming stories this year about children who have been abused by their \nparents who should have been \n\n[[Page S19095]]\nprotecting them. This conference report would increase the chances that \nthese children would languish in unsafe environments of abuse, neglect, \ndisease, and death. This Congress should not blithely go down the road \nthat will visit that kind of harm on the most vulnerable population of \nAmericans.\n  Finally, Mr. President, most frightening, the conference report will \npush 1.5 million children into poverty. This country already has a \nhigher child poverty rate than any other industrialized nation. Why \nwould this legislative body knowingly exacerbate that already shameful \nfigure?\n  It is clear to me that this plan fails those who need a national \nsafety net the most. Welfare should have, I think, two goals at least--\nprotecting children and helping adult recipients to become self-\nsufficient.\n  During the floor deliberations, I noted repeatedly that the majority \nof people receiving assistance under welfare, as we know it, are \nchildren. Currently, these are the facts. These are hard facts. This is \nnot somebody's idea or speculation.\n  Currently, there are 14 million individuals receiving cash \nassistance, and two-thirds of them, or 9 million of them, are children. \nWhile the welfare rolls overall have declined recently, the number of \nchildren receiving welfare assistance has remained constant. And that \ntrend is likely to continue because, while 50 percent of the recipients \nwho go on welfare leave it within a year, many of them have a tendency \nto cycle on and off the rolls due to low-paying, entry-level jobs that \nbarely provide a livable wage for a family. So we are looking at, \nagain, 9 million children being involved in this debate.\n  Mr. President, I am not arguing that anybody should get a free ride. \nI do not believe anybody in this body or in this legislature believes \nthat adults should get a free ride. People who can work should work. \nThe role of government is not to subsidize indefinitely those who are \ncapable of working. But it is our role, and indeed our responsibility, \nto provide a national safety net for children. It is not their fault \nthat they are poor. But it is our fault if this bill dooms them to stay \nthat way.\n  This Congress, Mr. President, should not pave the way to so-called \nwelfare reform at the expense of poor children. What amazes me about \nthis whole debate is that many of my colleagues know this and yet \ncontinue to support this legislation. Some of my colleagues believe \nthat poor children are expendable and that it is, therefore, OK to \nexperiment with their lives. If they can scratch and survive, that is \nfine. If they do not, well, that is life, and it is just too bad. It is \na cruel game of survival of the fittest. We actually heard testimony to \nthat effect in the Senate Finance Committee, and it was stunning to me.\n  But, Mr. President, policy based on political rhetoric is wrong. This \ndebate has focused on the stereotypes and it gets in the way of our \nunderstanding the facts. Senator Moynihan was brilliant earlier in \ntalking about the notion that the facts here are--facts that we really \nhave not gotten yet to the point of fully being able to appreciate, \nmuch less to know how, if you push one button, you will get one kind of \nconsequence.\n  So we are experimenting here based on stereotypes. We talked about \nthe stereotype of the underdeserving, freeloading poor for so long that \nmany of my colleagues, I think, are frankly determined not to let those \nmisperceptions stand in the way of their policymaking.\n  Mr. President, the fact is that most of the people who will be \naffected by this legislation are children.\n  So my colleagues who support this legislation continue to talk about \nthe parents so they will not have to face the consequences of the \nchildren.\n  It is very difficult, Mr. President, to survive and to compete, or to \nbe self-sufficient if you are a child. So I want to go over again some \nadditional facts that we must not let escape this debate.\n  Fact one, 22 percent of the children in this, the richest nation in \nthe world, live in poverty. In fact, I have a chart here on child \npoverty rates. I just hope that this, again, does not get lost in this \ndebate.\n  Child poverty rates among industrialized countries--here is the \nUnited States, 21.5. Here is Australia, Canada, Ireland, Israel, the \nU.K. can you imagine is here? Italy, Germany, France, the Netherlands, \nAustria, Norway, Luxembourg, Belgium, Switzerland, Denmark, Sweden, \nFinland--from 2.5 to 21.5 percent of the children in this country live \nin poverty.\n  Children living in poverty are more likely to have poor nutrition, to \nexperience a greater incidence of illness, and to perform more poorly \nin school, to obtain low-paying jobs and then to live in poverty as \nadults themselves. And even more shocking, Mr. President, even more \nshocking, every day, every day in this country, 27 children die due to \ncauses associated with their poverty.\n\n  I think these facts are or should be common knowledge for anyone who \nwould presume to legislate in an area such as this. And yet, Mr. \nPresident, this body has so far rejected attempts to provide some \nsubsistence to just the children. Assuming for a moment their parents \nare off the deep end and do not want to be self-sufficient or cannot \nfind a job through no fault of their own, at least let us provide for \nsome subsistence for the children. And this body has rejected those \nattempts. Quite frankly, if that is not mean-spirited, I do not know \nwhat is.\n  I am going to refer to this picture, which I am sure the Presiding \nOfficer has seen. This is a picture that was taken at the turn of the \ncentury, and it was an article in the Chicago History magazine called \n``Friendless Foundlings and Homeless Half Orphans.'' It talked about \nthe social service and social welfare system for children before we had \nthe national safety net that this legislation seeks to dismantle. In \nthat article on friendless foundlings and homeless half orphans, it \ntalked about the phenomenon of what happened to children, the \nfriendless foundlings, the children that the mothers would take and put \non the church steps or put on the doorway of someone who had money \nbecause they knew they could not feed them, or the homeless half \norphans, the children whose mothers, when the winter came and there was \nno way to support them, would take them to the orphanage and drop them \noff to be cared for during the wintertime.\n  It talked about the fact that the various States had various ways of \ndealing with this issue. And, in fact, in some States there were trains \nthat would take the babies that they found lying in the gutters and \nlying in the alleys and the streets and ship them out West so they \ncould be raised by farm families who could possibly provide them \nsubsistence.\n  Are we to go back to this? That is what this conference report would \nhave us do, Mr. President, and it is absolutely sobering and it is \nabsolutely unconscionable, in my mind. Need I remind you of this \nexperiment and would it not make sense for us to be reminded of what \nhappened then when we did not have a national safety net? Do we want to \ngo back to a time of friendless foundlings, homeless half orphans and \norphan trains? And do we want to go back to the whole idea of State \nflexibility? We have been there. As they say in the community, ``been \nthere; done that; hated it.'' We did that in this country. We had 50 \nseparate welfare systems in this United States and this is what it \nproduced. This conference report will send us back to that.\n  Mr. President, every child in this country is precious, too precious \nto risk on a poorly designed, shortsighted experiment, and that is what \nthis legislation is. It is an experiment. I say to my colleagues, if \nthe system is broke, this bill does not fix it but, rather, breaks it \nup even more and then shatters the parts and ships them out to the \nStates. I urge my colleagues to think long and hard before they support \nthis conference report for that reason.\n  In closing, Mr. President, I would like to end with a quote in a \nDecember 14 editorial from the Journal Star, a Peoria newspaper, \nremember how we used to talk about ``how is it playing in Peoria?'' I \nthink the Journal Star has it exactly right. After describing the gory \ndetails--and I told my colleague on the other side of the aisle I would \nnot read this out loud but, rather, would just put it in the Record--\nand the numerous negative consequences of this conference report, the \narticle concluded by saying, ``We're not opposed to welfare reform. \nWe're just opposed \n\n[[Page S19096]]\nto welfare reform that makes no sense.''\n  Mr. President, this bill makes no sense. This bill makes no sense. It \nwill do more harm than good. And I am just delighted that the President \nhas sent a letter saying that he will veto this bill and that he will \ndo so quickly so that we can come together and, based on the facts as \nwe know them, we can address welfare as we know it and begin to come up \nwith responses to this problem that will make us proud as Americans for \nhaving addressed the condition of those who have the least in our \ncommunity.\n  With that, Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I yield 5 minutes to the distinguished \nSenator from Michigan.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. I thank you very much, Mr. President.\n  Tonight I wish to talk about this bill from what I can see as a very \ndifferent perspective. It is a perspective shared by a lot of people in \nmy State and I think by people more broadly across America.\n  It may be that there are some in this Chamber who bought into the \nstereotype of people who are in the needy category in our country and \nview them only as freeloaders. I do not come from that perspective. We \nhave people in my State--I know them well--who would like very much to \nnot be dependent on the Government, people who would like to be earning \ntheir own income and people who would like to be on the first rung of \nthe economic ladder. I know it from my own family's experience. My own \nfather was at one time in a CCC camp, so I know a little bit about the \nexperiences of people in hard times and the desire that I think exists \nwithin all of us to not be dependent on Government but, rather, \ndependent on ourselves.\n  What I think most people are saying in this country today is very \nsimply this, that we have, over 20-plus years at a national level, \nattempted to fight a war on poverty with very little tangible success. \nThose who are below the poverty line today are approximately the same \npercentage of our country as the case when this program began. But in \nthe meantime, and contrary I think to some of the things suggested here \nduring the earlier debates and these, I think our States have changed \ntheir philosophy.\n  I know certainly that in Michigan the desire is not to have \nflexibility and liberation from Washington to put more people in \npoverty but, rather, to help the people who are below the poverty line \nto be able to take better care of themselves. Indeed, that is why I \nsupport this legislation, because I wish to really win the war on \npoverty, not just fight a battle that 20 years from now is at the same \npace and point that we are today.\n  We have a broken system, and it should be fixed. I think the \nlegislation before us moves us in the direction of fixing it. It \nestablishes goals that are long overdue--foremost among them, the \nnotion that intact families are a critical ingredient in addressing the \npoverty problem in America today; that the problem of illegitimacy, \nwhich many of our colleagues have spoken of and spoken more eloquently \nthan I and understand in more detail than I can understand, the problem \nof illegitimacy I think has been lost over the years during this \npoverty debate where a check became a substitute often for a parent, a \ncheck from Washington.\n  So I think it is time, as this bill does, to change the goals and to \nput intact families and reducing the illegitimacy at the top of our \nnational agenda, and also to put the goal of putting people to work \nrather than being part of a permanent welfare condition at the top of \nthe agenda. And most importantly, to put hope and the inspiration \nneeded to put people on the economic ladder at the top of the agenda. \nThe current system has I think failed us in achieving those objectives.\n  What the bill does strategically is this. It gives States, the people \non the front lines, the kind of flexibility they need to help people \nwho are on welfare. It says, let us have less bureaucracy in Washington \nand let us give the people on the front line, the front-line \ncaseworkers the chance to really work with people in our country who \nneed help to get them on the economic ladder. That is what we need. In \nmy State of Michigan, approximately two-thirds of the time of our \nfront-line welfare caseworkers is spent basically filling out \npaperwork, most of it for the Federal Government, instead of helping \nthe people these programs are intended to help.\n  A second objective is to give the States the flexibility to give \nbetter solutions to the problems, rather than the Washington-knows-best \nsolutions that they have labored under for far too long. The States in \nfact, Mr. President, care a lot more about the people who live in them \nthan anybody here inside the beltway. And Governors and legislators are \njust as concerned and compassionate as we are, and I happen to think \nare a lot more likely to be creative and inventive in dealing with the \nproblems in their own States than we possibly can be trying to \nadminister a 50-State program with one set of solutions. So State \nflexibility is a cornerstone of the program. So, too, is the \nconsolidation of the programs.\n  Instead of having the massive numbers of programs that have grown up \nduring the last 25 years, this program, this welfare bill, reduces, \nconsolidates programs. It saves us money in terms of bureaucracy but it \nmakes the programs comprehensible and workable, instead of far too \ncomplicated, and oftentimes in conflict with one another.\n  Third, it addresses, as I suggested earlier, the illegitimacy problem \nfacing our Nation today in a variety of, I think, very effective ways. \nDuring the original debate on this bill I was on the floor promoting \npart of this legislation which I helped draft, the so-called bonus to \nStates who reduce the rate of illegitimacy without simultaneously \nincreasing the number of abortions.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has used his 5 minutes.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I ask the manager if I might have an \nadditional 2 minutes?\n  Mr. ROTH. I yield 2 additional minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator may continue.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. I thank the Chair and I thank the manager.\n  This approach addressing the illegitimacy problems will start finally \nto focus priorities at the State level where they ought to be, on \nkeeping families intact, on reducing the number of out-of-wedlock \nbirths, and as a consequence addressing the problem at its core, the \nchild poverty statistics we hear so often about.\n  The concern I think we all have for children born in poverty is in no \nsmall sense a result of the fact that too many children are born out of \nwedlock into families that are not economically strong enough to \nprotect them.\n  Finally, the strategy in this legislation is to put strong, tough \nwork requirements into place and to give States the incentives they \nneed to try to get people to work rather than simply administering the \nmassive transfer of payment program that does very little to give \npeople the kind of dignity, incentive, and encouragement and help they \nneed to get onto the economic ladder.\n\n  For those reasons, Mr. President, I think this bill is on target. I \nwill support the conference report when we vote tomorrow. I hope that \nthe President will reconsider his comments with respect to vetoing the \nlegislation because I believe this truly will accomplish something that \nhe and many of us have spoken about in the context of our campaigns, \nthe notion that we truly would reform welfare and change welfare as we \nknow it.\n  This legislation ends business as usual. This legislation will \naddress the welfare problems effectively. Mr. President, I hope our \ncolleagues will support it. I thank the Chair and I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BENNETT addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Brown). Who yields time?\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I yield 10 minutes to the distinguished \nSenator from Utah.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah is recognized.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I appreciate the willingness of the \nmanager to yield me some time. I had the privilege of being in the \nchair and thereby being able to give my full attention to the statement \nof the Senator from New York, and following that the Senator from \nIllinois, two Senators for whom I have enormous respect and personal \naffection. \n\n[[Page S19097]]\n\n  I am moved by the clear and unalloyed concern they have for the \nchildren in poverty in our country and for the failure of our present \nsystem to solve that problem. I can think of no two Senators who have \nbetter motives and more genuine urges to solve this problem than these \ntwo.\n  I am a supporter of the conference report. And I want to respond to \nthe comments that were made so that my support for the conference \nreport will not be misunderstood. I think the Senator from New York put \nit in the best context when he described the signing ceremony that took \nplace in the Kennedy administration against a backdrop of great \noptimism and unfortunately complete ignorance as to what the future \nwould actually be like.\n  I think the Senator's point is well taken. We are embarking once \nagain on a leap of faith with considerable ignorance as to what the \nfuture would be like. I would be reluctant to take that leap of faith \nif I thought the present was working. But the present is not working. \nAnd I am willing to take a leap into the future in the hope that it \nwill be better than the present and frankly a fear that things could \nnot be much worse than we have in the present, that we are not risking \nthat much by dismantling some of the present circumstance.\n  Let me share with you an experience from my home State of Utah that \ngives me more hope for the future than perhaps my friends have. In the \nState of Utah we set up--I say we, I had nothing to do with it--the \nGovernor and the office of social services set up a program which \nrequired a whole series of waivers from Federal regulations in order to \nimplement.\n  These waivers took a great deal of time and effort to put in place. \nFinally the Feds said, ``Well, we will grant you the waivers''--my \nmemory tells me that it took 44 such waivers--``We will grant you the \nwaivers from the Federal regulations because we think the program you \nwill put in place will in fact improve the lot of the poor, who come \nunder your program. However, we tell you that based on our analysis, \nthe program will cost 20 percent more than is being expended right now. \nAnd we do not think you can afford it, but we will give you the \nopportunity to spend that extra money.''\n\n  We wanted to have--in response to the kinds of concerns the Senator \nfrom New York raised about ``understanding''--a proper kind of control \nof this circumstance, so even though some centers were set up for the \npilot program, in the one center where the most people would come for \nthe pilot program, they established a truly random control group; that \nis, one would come in and be put in the present Federal programs, the \nnext person through the door would be put in the State pilot program, \nthe next person through the door in the Federal program, the next \nperson in the State pilot program, and so on, so that you had exactly \nthe same kind of people, from exactly the same neighborhood, serviced \nby exactly the same social workers to see what happened.\n  Under the program devised by the State, which was completely \nflexible, the question asked was, ``What do you need? Tell us your \ncircumstance. And what do you need?''\n  ``Oh, all right, if this is what you need, I have control over all of \nthe Federal programs, all of the money, and I can give you so much for \nfood stamps, I can give you so much for this, I can give you so much \nfor that. By the way, before you receive this, we have to have an \nunderstanding that this is temporary and you are looking for work.''\n  Under those that came in under the Federal program, the question was \nnot ``What do you need?'' the question was, ``For what are you \neligible?'' The whole focus was on eligibility. ``You may need this \nprogram, but you don't happen to be eligible, and, therefore, I'm not \nempowered to give it to you. So I will give you only what you're \neligible for.''\n  And by the way, no one really brings up the issue of work. Very \ninteresting results. First the financial results. The program managed \nby the State was not 20 percent more expensive, it was 5 percent \ncheaper. We saved money. That was not the purpose of the program. The \npurpose of the program was to do something better for the people who \nwere poor, but the byproduct of doing it the way we did it is that we \nsaved money. People who came in who had never had an experience with \nthe welfare system before, when asked ``Are you willing to go to \nwork?'' responded instantly, ``Of course. That's what I want. I am only \nhere because I can't get work.''\n  ``We'll help you find a job. That is part of the reason we're here \nfor. We'll help you find employment.''\n  People who came in who had experience with the Federal welfare \nprogram before said, ``Wait a minute. Nobody ever asked me about work \nbefore. And I don't want to talk to you about that. I'm here to get \nthat to which I am entitled. And I'm going to fight you if you say I \nhave to do anything other than show up.'' Admittedly, those are people \nwho had previous experience with the Federal welfare program.\n  The people who had not had the previous experience did not have that \nattitude. But among the new folk who were coming in for the first \ntime--automatic--``We want to do something to get a job.''\n  These are the statistics, as I remember them. The folks under the \nState pilot program, 95 percent of them are ultimately employed. \nAdmittedly, they may not be employed in the kinds of jobs you and I \nwould like, Mr. President. There are many of them employed in what are \nsometimes derisively called leaf raking jobs, but there are things for \nthem to do somewhere, someplace that the office involved with their \nlives helps them find. And 95 percent of them have some kind of income \nas a result of their work.\n  Mr. President, I cite this example as justification for my support of \nthis conference report. The State devised this program, and it is \nbetter than the Federal program. The State devised this program, and it \nis cheaper than the Federal program. Then the final blow here, that \nsays to me we must do what we can to get this out of the hands of the \nFederal control.\n  Donna Shalala came to Utah and saw this program, and she was \nentranced. She said, ``This is what we should be doing nationwide.'' \nThat was 3 years ago, Mr. President, and nothing has happened at the \nFederal level.\n  The Federal bureaucracy is so cumbersome and so difficult that even \nthe Secretary, with all of her good will and desire to solve these \nproblems--and I grant her all of that--has been unable to move the \nbureaucracy under her control in the direction that she herself said it \nought to go. Governors move more rapidly than that. Federal \nbureaucrats, if I may use an old cliche, and I know that it is not \nentirely fair, but it makes the point. When I entered the Federal \nbureaucracy, I was told, we think in 40-year periods because that's how \nlong it takes us to get our pension.\n  Governors get reelected in 4-year periods, so perhaps they think 10 \ntimes as rapidly. But the Governor who put in place the program I have \njust described already knew at the time he was doing that that he was \ngoing to face the electorate 4 years later and he had to have a success \nand he had to have it quickly. The bureaucrats who are in the Civil \nService who think in 40-year periods think perhaps some day we might.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. I yield 5 minutes to my friend from Utah. He makes \ngreat sense.\n  Mr. BENNETT. I thank the Senator for his courtesy. I had not intended \nto go on this long. But it is this experience that has said to me: we \nought to try this. We ought to turn this over to the States and see \nwhat happens.\n  When people say to me, ``But you're playing with children's lives \nhere''--and the Senator from Illinois was tremendously moving in her \ncomments in that regard, and that is one of the reasons I take the \nfloor, because I want to make it clear I am aware of the fact that we \nare playing with children's lives here, and I do not take that \nresponsibility lightly--but I look at the results of the present system \nand I say, ``What are we risking if we try something else?'' I look at \nthe disasters that have occurred under the present system and \nultimately decide we are not risking that much.\n  Mr. President, I am not announcing for reelection at this point, but \nI expect to be in the Senate longer than my present term. I assure the \nSenator from New York and anyone else, if we \n\n[[Page S19098]]\nfind out, as a result of the passing of this kind of torch from the \nFederal level to the State level, that we do, indeed, get a race to the \nbottom, we do, indeed, see greater disasters than what we have right \nnow, I will be one of the first Senators to come here and say, ``Let us \nnot let the future roll continue'' for however many years it has been \nsince President Kennedy signed that bill that I think had a major, \nsignificant impact on the rise of homelessness. I will be one of the \nfirst Senators to be here and say, ``OK, we tried it, it is clearly not \nworking, the race to the bottom is happening, let's stop it, let's stop \nit now.''\n\n  But I am not content to let the present circumstances go on without \nthis kind of experimentation, because the human tragedy that the \npresent circumstances created is so significant that we must do what we \ncan.\n  I thank the Senator for his courtesy. That is my response to \nlistening to the comments that were made. I appreciate the Senators \nletting me get it out while it is still fresh in my mind. I yield the \nfloor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I yield myself 5 minutes, briefly to \nrespond to my distinguished friend from Utah to say that I believe \nevery word he says is true for him. I do not think this will lead to a \nrace to the bottom in Utah. It will in New York, I am sorry to say. The \nproportions are so much vaster.\n  In New York City, we have 1.1 million people on welfare at this \nmoment. These are overwhelmed systems, and you do what is easiest: You \nsend out checks. That is the cheapest, easiest, and most destructive \nthing to do. We are learning the kinds of things you describe in Utah. \nThe Manpower Development Research Corp., which is the principal \nevaluator of studies like this, said of some study results in Atlanta, \nRiverside, CA, Grand Rapids, MI, that they had an effect on bringing \ndown AFDC rolls to the point where they said this exceeds the savings \nachieved by experimentally evaluated programs in the last 15 years.\n  We are beginning to get a hold, maybe. I begin with the thought that \nthings are so much worse than we know.\n  In the fine State of Utah in 1970, the illegitimacy ratio was 3.6 \npercent. It is now 15.5. That is half the national average, but the \ntrend line is the same. This is something so deep in our society, we \nhave not found an answer. I simply want to maintain a national \ncommitment, but I am sure that Secretary Shalala said just what she \ndid, and I am sure she tried to move the Department of Health and Human \nServices.\n  That is our dilemma. The easiest thing to do is what we now do and it \nis the most destructive, but it need not be that way. President Reagan \nthought it would change, and it is changing, because the Utah program \nproceeds under the Family Support Act.\n  I can say no more but thanks for the candor and the quality of the \nSenator's statement.\n  Mr. President, the Senator from New Jersey was to be next. I am sorry \nif I seem to be stammering here, but it is because I am stammering.\n  The Senator from New Jersey is here now, and I would like to yield \nhim such time as he may desire for the purpose of speaking. The Senator \nwas one of 11 Members on this side who voted against this bill when it \nfirst came forward.\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Thank you very much, Mr. President. I thank my friend \nand colleague from New York not only for allotting me some of the time \nto respond to this conference report, but also for his long-time work, \nscholarly review of the problems of families, welfare, and balance in \nour society. Few have paid as much attention to the issue as has the \ndistinguished Senator from New York.\n  Oddly enough, however, whenever I am doing something with the Senator \nfrom New York, whether I sit on the Environment Committee or another \ncommittee, he always has more knowledge than anyone else. I am still \ntrying to figure out how he does it, but he does it very well. This is \njust one example of many.\n  Mr. President, I rise in strong opposition to the conference report. \nI think it is a terrible Christmas present to give the children in our \ncountry. If this bill becomes law, many children in this Nation will \nwake up on Christmas day with no safety net and hardly any prospect of \nanything pleasant in the Christmas stocking.\n  This piece of legislation represents the worst, I think, of Speaker \nGingrich's agenda. It rips at the safety net, tears it to shreds. These \npoor children fend for themselves, and it violates the most basic \nvalues of our country.\n  Mr. President, all of us here constantly extoll the justified virtues \nof this Nation of ours, the greatest country on God's Earth. But what a \nparadox. Here we are, the wealthiest country in the world, no \nexceptions, and despite our prosperity, 9 million children are so poor \nthat their families are on AFDC assistance.\n  Mr. President, there is no question that the current welfare system \nneeds reform. I think there are many avenues of reform that are not \nfully explored. I think we want to encourage family structuring. I \nthink we have to think in terms of letting someone who is on welfare--\ntypically a woman with children--who perhaps meets someone that she \nwould like to share her life with and provide her own family network, \nwe immediately say to her, ``Well, you are off the welfare assistance, \nyou are out of the health care program.''\n  What you do is you cut off your opportunities when you form this \nunion, and you are in far worse shape than you otherwise would be. That \ndoes not encourage family togetherness. What it does do is it \nencourages a kind of deception and says, ``OK, you maintain your \naddress; I maintain my address; and we will cohabitate, but we will not \nviolate the rules.'' I think we ought to be looking at that kind of \nprogram. We ought to help welfare recipients find productive work. I am \nall for that. I do not think we ought to punish the poor kids who are \non AFDC.\n  Mr. President, this bill is not a serious policy document. It is a \nbudget document. It is a downpayment on the Republican tax break that \ntargets the benefits for the millionaires and other wealthy Americans. \nWe found out what the thinking is when I proposed an amendment one \nnight that said, tell you what we will do, friends in the U.S. Senate. \nWe will limit any tax break to those who earn under $1 million. Well, \nthe outcome of the vote is in the Record. We did not get any Republican \nvotes on that one. They said that even if you earn over $1 million, if \na tax break comes along, you have to get your share. We know what we \nface.\n  I had the opportunity yesterday morning to be on one of the early-\nmorning local shows with a freshman Republican Congressman from the \nother body, and we start our discussion and the first thing he says is, \n``We are committed to providing that tax break.'' That overrides almost \nevery other consideration. That is why we are here, wringing our hands, \npleading the plight of those who face Christmas without an income, with \na great deal of uncertainty, 280,000, roughly, Federal employees who \ngive their all whenever they are asked, but now suddenly we have \ndecided that they are good pawns to play in this chess game. Why? So \nthey can force this reconciliation bill down the throat of the \nadministration. It is a terrible game to play, I think.\n\n  The focus is on the tax break. Included in that will be those who are \ndependent on welfare who will suffer significantly if the program, as \nprescribed now, through the conference committee, goes through.\n  If you make $350,000 a year, the GOP reconciliation bill includes an \n$8,500 tax break. It is nice but certainly not necessary. I think it is \npainful because it comes from other people who do not have the means to \nget by on a day-to-day basis.\n  I want to talk for a moment about some of the facts with this \nlegislation. The proponents talk about philosophy, giving States \nflexibility. It sounds good, but I found out there is kind of a catch-\nall situation here that says it is the bureaucracy--they do not say it \nis the bureaucracy, stupid; sometimes they say that--but it is the \nbureaucracy. That is the evil force that commands everything here. It \nmay be a bureaucracy, but I do not know how you conduct a business or a \nstructure of any kind without having people who work there--in this \ncase, we are talking about people who are told to carry on policy in a \nparticular fashion--and \n\n[[Page S19099]]\nperhaps they need more training, perhaps we have to alter the policy.\n  To conceal the fact that we are going to be shortchanging the \nrecipients, the dependents on the welfare assistance, by calling it a \nblock grant is, I believe, hypocrisy. The fact is that an HHS study \nshows this legislation--I was reminded about it in a letter I have \nincluded among my precious papers, a letter from the Senator from New \nYork, just a short paragraph, talking about the children that will pay \na price for the legislation that passed this body the first time with \n11 Democrats and one Republican voting the other way.\n  Mr. President, 1.2 million to 2 million children will be facing \nhunger in roughly 7 years. That is hardly a way to design a program--\npunish the children, move 1 million to 2 million of them into poverty, \ninto hunger. This is based on conservative assumptions. In all \nlikelihood, the figure will be somewhat higher. I wish all Senators \nwould fully appreciate what we are doing. Living below the poverty line \nis not a particularly pleasant experience. Having tried it myself as a \nchild, I did not like it. My parents did not like it. The poverty level \nfor a family of three, a woman and two children in this country, is \n$11,800 a year. How many people here believe that they could properly \nraise two children on $11,800 a year? It is not possible.\n\n  This bill also cuts food stamp funding by over $32 billion. These \ncuts, literally, as I said earlier, will take the food out of the \nmouths of our children.\n  Unfortunately, this bill is not the end of the pain for our Nation's \nchildren. The budget reconciliation is yet another assault on our \nchildren. The Republican budget bill ends the guarantee of health care \nfor poor children. The bill's Medicaid cuts will mean that about 4 \nmillion kids--to use the expression--will be denied health care \ncoverage. The cuts in the earned-income tax credit will mean that the \nparents of 14.5 million children, parents making under $30,000 a year, \nwill get a tax increase on average of $332 a year.\n  Mr. President, $332 does not seem like a lot of money. But to a poor \nfamily it is an enormous sum. Working parents could use this money to \nbuy the basic food, books, clothing, and pay for rent. I think it is \nunconscionable that our friends in the Republican majority are asking \nthis of our children while providing a $8,500 tax break for people who \nmake over $350,000 a year.\n  Republicans say they are making these deep cuts to help the children, \nthe next generation. If I were the children I would say to them, \n``Thanks; no thanks. Do not do us any favors. Just kind of keep us in \nbalance now. Make sure we get the appropriate nutrition so we can learn \nand be productive citizens.''\n  The one thing I think that is really fallacious in what I hear going \naround here is that, somehow or other, those who are poor, those who \nare, perhaps, different, are another group. They do not belong to us.\n  One does not have to be a genius to know that we all have a stake in \ntheir well-being. It is our responsibility to protect them and help \nlift them out of poverty as if they were our own children, because we \nwill pay the price--in many cases personally--for the lack of \ndevelopment that these children suffer.\n  I do not know how many have been to Brazil, to Rio de Janiero, one of \nthe most beautiful cities in the world, where poverty fills every sight \nthat you see, whether it is the mountains or the sea or what have you. \nLittle kids, abandoned by their families, who will steal from open \ntables in the restaurant. I saw it happen. Because they are so hungry, \nthey do not know any bounds, by virtue of appropriate conduct. Hunger, \ncunning takes over at all levels.\n  There was a shocking program the other night on ``Nightline'' about \nchildren who beg in the streets of Rio, who, when they get to be just a \nlittle more than 8 or 9 or 10 years old, they realize that their appeal \nfor this baby face no longer has a salutary effect on the cups that \nthey hold out for coins. Do you know what they do? They turn to \nprostitution at 9, 10, 11 years old. And they turn HIV positive in a \nhurry. And there is an epidemic of AIDS among little kids in Brazil, \nbecause they sell themselves. They do not know any other way to stay \nalive.\n  That is hardly a picture that we ought to aspire to and I am sure we \ndo not. Those who are against this, I am not suggesting in any way, are \nfor that kind of condition. But that is the reality when you cut off \nfood and shelter and some caring concern. These little people find ways \nto exist, ways that we do not like, ways that we do not approve of, \nespecially when they get a weapon in their hands, and especially when \nthey gang up on someone who they think has the means to help them out.\n\n  That is why they are our responsibility, as well as some compassion \nin the hearts and souls of Americans. We have that as a people.\n  So, Mr. President, I hope we will reconsider. I hope my colleagues \nwill reject this legislation. Once again, I commend our colleague from \nNew York for his distinguished leadership in so many things, but \nparticularly with this piece of legislation on welfare. I commend the \nPresident, also, for his veto statement, and I hope we will be able to \nsustain it.\n  Mr. President, this piece of legislation represents the worst of \nSpeaker Gingrich's radical agenda. It tears the safety net to threads. \nIt leaves poor children to fend for themselves. It violates the most \nbasic values of our Nation.\n  Mr. President, we live in the greatest nation on Earth. We are the \nwealthiest country in the world. But it is clear that some in our \nsociety do not share in this wealth. They are poor. They are jobless \nand in some cases homeless. And they must rely on public assistance to \nsurvive. In America, this is unacceptable. And we should be committed \nto improving their lives.\n  Mr. President, there in no question that the current welfare system \nneeds reform. But the central goal for any welfare reform bill should \nbe to move welfare recipients into productive work.\n  This will only happen if we provide welfare recipients with education \nand job training to prepare them for employment. It will only happen if \nwe provide families with affordable child care. It will only happen if \nwe can place them into jobs, preferably in the private sector or--as a \nlast resort--in community service.\n  But this welfare bill is not designed to help welfare recipients get \non their feet and go to work. It is only designed to cut programs--pure \nand simple.\n  It is designed to take money from the poor so that Republicans can \nprovide huge tax cuts for the rich. That is what is really going on \nhere.\n  Unfortunately, Mr. President, the radical experiment proposed in this \nlegislation will inflict additional problems on our society while \nproducing defenseless victims.\n  Those victims are not represented in the Senate offices. They are not \nhere lobbying against this bill. They do not even know they are at \nrisk.\n  The victims will be America's children. And there will be millions of \nthem.\n  Mr. President, the AFDC Program provides a safety net for 9 million \nchildren. These young people are innocent. They did not ask to be born \ninto poverty. And they don't deserve to be punished.\n  These children are African-American, Hispanic, Asian, and white. They \nlive in urban areas and rural areas. But, most importantly, they are \nAmerican children. And we as a nation have a responsibility to provide \nthem with a safety net.\n  The children we are talking about are desperately poor, Mr. \nPresident. They are not living high off the hog. These kids live in \nvery poor conditions.\n  Mr. President, it is hard for many of us to appreciate what life is \nlike for the 9 million children who are poor and who benefit from AFDC.\n  I grew up to a working class family in Paterson, NJ, in the heart of \nthe Depression. Times were tough. And I learned all too well what it \nmeant to struggle economically.\n  But as bad as things were for my own family, they still were not as \nbad as for millions of today's children.\n  These are children who are not always sure whether they will get \ntheir next meal. Not always sure that they will have a roof over their \nheads. Not always sure they will get the health care they need.\n  Mr. President, these children are vulnerable. They are living on the \nedge of homelessness and hunger. And they did not do anything to \ndeserve this fate. \n\n[[Page S19100]]\n\n  Mr. President, if we are serious about reforming a program that keeps \nthese children afloat, we will not adopt a radical proposal like this \nbill. We will not put millions of American children at risk. And we \nwill not simply give a blank check to States and throw up our hands.\n  Mr. President, this Republican bill isn't a serious policy document. \nIt is a budget document. It is a downpayment on a Republican tax break \nthat targets huge benefits for millionaires and other wealthy \nAmericans. For those who make $350,000 per year, the GOP reconciliation \nbill includes an $8,500 tax break.\n  Mr. President, if the Republicans were serious about improving \nopportunities for those on welfare, they would be talking about \nincreasing our commitment to education and job training. In fact, only \nlast year, the House Republican welfare reform bill, authored in part \nby Senator Santorum, would have increased spending on education and \ntraining by $10 billion.\n  This year, by contrast, this welfare bill actually cuts $82 billion, \nincluding huge reductions in education and training.\n  So what has changed? The answer is simple. This year, the Republicans \nneed the money for their tax breaks for the rich.\n  Mr. President, shifting our welfare system to 50 State bureaucracies \nmay give Congress more money to provide tax breaks. But it is not going \nto solve the serious problems facing our welfare system, or the people \nit serves.\n  To really reform welfare, Mr. President, we first must emphasize a \nvery basic American value: the value of work.\n  We should expect recipients to work. In fact, we should demand that \nthey work, if they can.\n  Of course, Mr. President, that kind of emphasis on work is important. \nBut it is not enough. We also have to help people get the skills they \nneed to get a job in the private sector. I am not talking about \nhandouts.\n  I am talking about teaching people to read. Teaching people how to \nrun a cash register or a computer. Teaching people what it takes to be \nself-sufficient in today's economy.\n  We also have to provide child care.\n  Mr. President, How is a woman with several young children supposed to \nfind a job if she cannot find someone to take care of her kids? It is \nsimply impossible. There is just no point in pretending otherwise.\n  Unfortunately, this bill does not address these kind of needs. It \ndoes not even try to promote work. It does not even try to give people \njob training. It does little to provide child care.\n  All it does is throw up its hands and ship the program to the States. \nThat is it.\n  Mr. President, that is not real welfare reform. It is simply passing \nthe buck to save a buck. And who is going to get the buck that is \nsaved? The people the Republicans really care about: those who are well \noff.\n  Mr. President, I would like to take a moment now to talk about some \nof the facts about this legislation. The proponents of this legislation \ntalk about philosophy and giving States flexibility, but I would like \nto talk about the facts.\n  The fact is that an HHS study showed that this legislation will force \n1.2 to 2.1 million children into poverty.\n  And this is based on conservative assumptions. In all likelihood, the \nfigure will be much higher.\n  Mr. President, I wish that all Senators would fully appreciate this. \nLiving below the poverty rate is no fun. As I said, the poverty level \nfor a family of three, a woman with two children, is $11,821 per year.\n  Mr. President, How many people here think that they could raise two \nchildren well on $11,821 per year?\n  Mr. President, not only does this analysis contain conservative \nassumptions, it also does not document what will happen to those \nchildren who already live in poverty. It is clear that they will also \nbe harmed by this legislation because AFDC spending will be frozen at \n1994 levels under this bill even though the cost of living for the poor \nwill rise during the next 7 years.\n  This bill also includes a mandatory 5-year cap for the receipt of \nbenefits. Once this time period is completed, there is nothing left for \na poor family. No job, no education, no income support--nothing.\n  Mr. President, this seems like a benign provision but it will have \nharsh consequences for our children.\n  The cap will mean that 3.3 to 4.3 million children will get no help \nafter 5 years. They will have no income support. They could be \nhomeless.\n  Mr. President, I would like to point out that the 5-year cap is a \nmaximum. It is an outer barrier. States can enact 1-, 2-, or 3-year \ncaps and that will mean that even more children will have to go without \nassistance.\n  Mr. President, this bill also cuts Supplemental Security Income [SSI] \nbenefits for disabled children. Under this conference report, 300,000 \ndisabled children will be denied benefits in the year 2002.\n  Furthermore, approximately 500,000 children with disabilities, such \nas cerebral palsy, Down's syndrome, muscular dystrophy and cystic \nfibrosis, would have their benefits cut in the year 2002.\n  Mr. President, this bill also cuts food stamp funding by $36 billion. \nThese cuts will literally take food right out of the mouths of our \nchildren.\n  Mr. President, the children of this country belong to all of us. We \nall have a stake in their well being. It is our responsibility to \nprotect them, as if they were our own children.\n  And, Mr. President, I would point out that we don't take risks with \nour own children's well being. We do not say to them--you better shape \nup or we will put you out on the street without food.\n  We protect our own children. And we want to do more to help them. \nParents across this country work hard to make sure that their children \nwill have a better life. This is the same philosophy we should take \ntowards reforming our welfare system. We must protect our children and \nwe must help them become better off.\n  We can not do this by cutting millions of children off and forcing \nthem into poverty. This will make them worse off--not better off.\n  Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to reject this legislation and I \nurge the President to issue an emphatic veto.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I yield myself such time as I may \nrequire to thank my colleague and neighbor and friend from New Jersey \nfor his statement, and particularly for raising a point, absolutely \ncentral to the legislation before us, which has not been raised until \nthis moment in the debate, which is that this measure would repeal the \neligibility of families who are now on Aid to Families with Dependent \nChildren for Medicaid. This was not in the bill that passed the House. \nIt was not in H.R. 4. It was not in the Senate bill. It is in the \nconference bill, which we have never seen. We never saw it. The \nconference never met.\n  I am sorry, we met once, October 24, for opening statements. And it \nnever met again and the bill has come out. It was handed to us, the \nconference report was handed to us this afternoon. We found out what \nthe Senator from New Jersey has said. That is the degree of the \ndestructiveness of this measure.\n  I find it hard to comprehend, but I am not in the least surprised \nthat every major religious group in the country, save one alone, pleads \nwith us ``Don't do this.'' Catholic bishops, the Lutheran Conference, \non and on, UJA: ``Don't do this to children.''\n  I am increasingly confident, Mr. President, that we will not.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who seeks recognition? The Senator from \nDelaware.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I yield 10 minutes to the distinguished \nSenator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Thank you, Senator Roth, and thank you for being a good \nchairman of this committee and shepherding through a very important \npiece of legislation.\n  I have to acknowledge that it is with mixed emotions that I speak \ntonight on this conference report before us. I am very pleased to join \nmy colleagues in support of a sweeping welfare reform proposal, \nprobably the most sweeping in recent history. But I am angry at the \nPresident for saying that he will veto this.\n  I suppose you would say I should not be surprised that the President \nwould veto this. I suppose you would look at his complaining about the \nGovernment being shut down and understand that he vetoed four bills \nthis week, that if \n\n[[Page S19101]]\nhe had not vetoed them, Government would be functioning. Yet he wants \nto point the finger at us.\n  This is the President who, in 1992, said we are going to change, \nreform welfare as we know it. He said that as a candidate. He said that \nas President of the United States. And considering the fact that he is \nalways for a balanced budget on television but never negotiating for a \nbalanced budget when he sits down to do it, or his people sit down to \ndo it, and you cannot even get numbers on a sheet of paper, we maybe \nshould not be surprised that the President said he is for reforming \nwelfare as we know it and all of a sudden does not want to reform \nwelfare as we know it, because he has a record of changing his mind on \nthe very most critical issues before our country. He kind of has a real \nproblem with making up his mind.\n\n  Mr. President, I have made up my mind. I am supporting this \nconference agreement. The House passed this conference by a vote of 245 \nto 178. That is a bipartisan vote. We should pass this bill more \noverwhelmingly than the House did. Remember, this passed the Senate 88 \nto 11. As I have said many times on this floor, States have been very \nsuccessful in their efforts to reform welfare under waivers that are \nbegrudgingly given to them by some faceless bureaucrat from time to \ntime down at HHS. My own State of Iowa has a very successful effort at \nmoving people from welfare to work, saving the taxpayers money, moving \npeople off of welfare completely and trying to change the atmosphere in \nwelfare of dependence to one of independence, where there is a sense of \npride and esteem once again. The way my State of Iowa is doing this is \nby having the highest percentage of any State in the Nation of welfare \nrecipients who are on private-sector jobs.\n  We have raised that percentage in 3 years of our reform from 18 \npercent to 34 percent. This is the kind of success that we at the \nFederal level have failed to achieve. Even in our best attempts in the \n1988 Family Support Act we failed. That bill passed 96 to 1. That vote \nmeans that it was the best of intent to reform welfare. But we have \nthree and a quarter million more people on welfare now than we did \nthen. And it is costing billions of dollars more, which means we have \nfailed to reform welfare.\n  We have seen States in the meantime succeed at welfare reform. That \nis the premise of this legislation. Moving out of the Washington \nbureaucracy the responsibility for welfare, moving it to our State and \nlocal governments to accomplish what we could not accomplish--moving \npeople from welfare to work, moving people from dependence to \nindependence, and saving the taxpayers' money.\n  I am pleased that we are making this move. We are acknowledging that \nwe in Congress do not have a lock on wisdom or compassion. We are \nsaying that we trust Governors and State legislatures to take care of \ncitizens in need, and to do it with a community-based approach and to \nreform welfare thus doing.\n  When we started this process 10 months ago now, I set four goals that \nI wanted to accomplish in welfare reform.\n  First, to provide a system that will meet the short-term needs of \nlow-income Americans as they prepare for independence.\n  Second, to provide States a great deal of flexibility.\n  Third, to reduce the incidence of out-of-wedlock births.\n  And, finally to save the taxpayers some of their hard-earned money.\n  I am pleased that Senator Roth has led a conference that has given us \na report that substantially addresses each of these goals.\n  The conference report provides for a block grant of the AFDC program \nto the States so that the States can meet the needs of low-income \nAmericans in the most community-oriented, cost-efficient manner. It \naccepts a fact of life--that you cannot pour one mold here in \nWashington, DC, and expect to spend the taxpayers' money wisely solving \nthe problems the same in New York City as you do in Waterloo, IA. This \nwill let New York do the best with the taxpayers' money they can to \naccomplish the goals that they know should be accomplished, and the \npeople in Iowa will do it according to their best way.\n  In doing so, this gives the States the great flexibility they need to \ndesign their programs to meet the needs of their individual citizens. \nIowa has demonstrated a great benefit of the program designed with its \ncitizens in mind, its very own program. Over 2 years ago, the Iowa \nState Legislature passed a bill that totally overhauls our welfare \nsystem. State leaders came to us at the Congress at the Federal level \nfor that waiver necessary to implement their ideas. The waiver was \nfinally approved, and the State plan was implemented in October 1993.\n  As I mentioned before, in the last 2 years, we have moved from 18 \npercent to 34 percent the number of our welfare recipients in jobs. \nThis dramatic increase shows the ingenuity of the Iowa State plan to \nmove people from welfare to work. It also shows the importance of \ngiving much greater flexibility to State leaders.\n  Another positive portion of the final report is that it protects \nStates which are under waiver agreements like my State of Iowa.\n  When Iowa came to the Federal Government for their waiver, they were \nrequired to have a cost neutrality clause in their contract agreement \nwith the Federal Government. If my State wanted to try new ideas, then \nthey were told by the Federal Government that they would have to bear \nthe burden of any additional cost incurred. Being sensitive to the \nFederal deficit, I understood the need for that agreement.\n  But since we are now changing the rules of the game midstream, it was \ncritical that we not hold the States liable under those waiver \nagreements. Since we are going to change our end of the deal--we at the \nFederal level by this legislation--States should not be required to \nlive up to their end of the deal. This issue was addressed in the \nconference agreement by allowing States to cancel their waiver \nagreements while addressing the up-front costs that States have \ninvested in their welfare programs.\n  My next goal was to take steps to address the seemingly intractable \nproblem of out-of-wedlock births. The conference report requires that \nteenage mothers live at home, or in a supervised setting. If there is \nanything that we should all be able to agree upon, it is that young \nteenage mothers should not be left alone in raising children. They need \nsupport.\n  Witness after witness who came before Senator Roth's committee agreed \nthat teenage moms should not be left to fend for themselves and their \nchildren.\n  The conference also keeps the family cap but allows States to opt out \nif they desire. This compromise between the original House and Senate \nlanguage is reasonable because it keeps the States from ignoring the \nissue but leaves the final determination to each State legislature.\n  My last goal--to save the taxpayers some of their hard-earned money--\nis really more of a result of reform than a goal itself. If we take \nsteps to move people from welfare to work, give greater flexibility to \nthe States, and reduce illegitimacy, we will--in the long run--save \nsome taxpayer money. This would be a positive result.\n  I urge my colleagues to recognize this conference agreement as a good \ncompromise between the House and Senate bills. It accomplishes the \nPresident's goal to end welfare as we know it.\n  We should send the President this conference report in the hopes that \nhe will reconsider his recent comments and sign this bill into law. I \nurge adoption of the conference agreement.\n  Mr. KENNEDY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, as I understand it, we have been rotating \nback and forth. I know that Senator Grams has been here. I do not \nintend to take very long. But I would like to address the Senate on \nthis issue.\n  I yield myself 12 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, there is a right way and a wrong way to \nreform welfare. Punishing children is the wrong way. Denying realistic \njob training and work opportunities is the wrong way. Leaving States \nholding the bag is the wrong way. While we all want to reform welfare, \nthis conference report is simply the wrong way. It takes a bad Senate \nbill and makes it worse.\n\n[[Page S19102]]\n\n  Mr. President, I know all of our Members are familiar with the \nexcellent work that has been done by our friend, the Senator from New \nYork, Senator Moynihan, both in his presentations earlier this evening \nand his very considerable contribution to this debate over the years. I \nhope all of our Members will read carefully, prior to the time that we \nvote, the presentation of our good friend and colleague, Senator \nMoynihan.\n  The Senate bill eliminated a 60-year old good faith national \ncommitment to protect all needy children, and for that reason, in my \nopinion, it was fatally flawed. The Office of Management and Budget \ndocumented that the Senate bill would have pushed an additional 1.2 \nmillion children into poverty--hardly the goal of real reform. This \nconference report simply adds insult to injury. It will undoubtedly \nresult in increased suffering for millions of American children and \nfamilies. It continues to be legislative child abuse--and it should be \ndefeated.\n  The Senate bill cut food stamps for 14 million children, SSI benefits \nfor 225,000 disabled children, essential protections for 100,000 abused \nchildren, and minimal assistance for 4 million children left with no \nsafety net after the time limit. This conference report slashes each of \nthese survival programs even further--with nutrition services, \ndisability benefits, and child protection efforts footing most of the \nbill.\n  If the conference report becomes law, children born to parents on \nwelfare will be punished in every State. Victims of domestic violence \nwill lose their special protections. Food stamps for the working poor \nand the unemployed will be further restricted. Women and children on \nAFDC will lose their Medicaid guarantee. Family preservation programs, \nchild abuse programs, and child nutrition programs will be block \ngranted. Family hardship exemptions and State investment requirements \nwill be further reduced. All this pain is inflicted above and beyond \nthe Senate bill.\n  And even the modest child care provisions added to the Republican \nHome Alone bill on the Senate floor have been rolled back. The \nRepublican welfare agreement not only falls far short of providing \nessential child care funding but guts essential protections for \nchildren in child care.\n  During consideration of the Senate bill, the Congressional Budget \nOffice said most States were likely to simply throw up their hands and \nignore the new work requirements. Unfortunately, nothing on that front \nhas changed for the better. CBO continues to believe that under this \nconference agreement, States will accept the sanctions for failing to \ncomply, rather than try to reach the goals without the resources needed \nto make it possible.\n  This conference report more than doubles the child care short fall \nfound in the final Senate bill. According to the Congressional Budget \nOffice, the conference report is more than $6 billion short of \nproviding States with enough child care funding to make the work \nrequirements work. Once again, this is not welfare reform; it is \nwelfare fraud.\n  What we know is that there are certain ingredients which are \nnecessary to make any real welfare reform effort work. First of all, \nyou have to provide some degree of job training and education for the \nindividual. There has to be a job market out there so that the \nindividual is able to gain employment and hopefully earn a decent wage. \nAnd there has to be health insurance coverage, particularly for small \nchildren, and there has to be child care.\n  Those are the effective ingredients and without these effective \ningredients we are not going to have the kind of welfare reform which \nis so important and necessary. We will not be able to move people out \nof dependency into some degree of hope and opportunity for themselves \nand for their children.\n  What we have seen here is, even after the debate held on the floor of \nthe Senate, even after the amendment of Senator Dodd, myself and others \nwas accepted, it goes to the conference and is rolled back from that \nposition. Not only is the total amount of funds inadequate, but the \nprotections for children in child care are gone.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Will the Senator from Massachusetts yield for a \nquestion?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. If any Member of this Senate wants to see the best child \ncare in this country, go to a military base. Go to any military camp \nacross this country and you see child care programs at their very best. \nThat is what has happened, Mr. President. Military child care \nrepresents the kind of high quality care that was fought for by our \nfriend and colleague, Senator Dodd, and also that was eventually worked \nout in a bipartisan way with Senator Hatch and Senator Dodd and signed \ninto law by President Bush--bipartisan support.\n  Now we read that these important child care protections have been \nstripped away in this conference report. It is absolutely untenable. \nAnd you and I know what is going to happen. With inadequate funding and \nprotections for child care, we are going to hear in another 2 or 3 \nyears about how child care is being bungled in the various States, and \nthis is going to be used as an excuse to further reduce it. That is \nwhat is going to happen. And that I think is unfair, unjustified, and \nunwarranted.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Will the Senator from Massachusetts yield for a \nquestion?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I would like to just finish. I do not intend to speak \nfor long. And then I will be glad to yield.\n  Mr. President, further, the conference agreement will undoubtedly \nensure that those struggling to stay off welfare will lose their \nsupport to those seeking to get off welfare. But low-income working \nfamilies need help, too. The average cost of a child in child care is \nalmost $5,000 a year, yet the take-home pay from a minimum wage job is \nstuck at $8,500 a year. This is not manageable. It is not acceptable.\n  The conference agreement pulls the rug out from under these families \njust as they are getting on their feet. Such an approach is callous and \ncounterproductive. In Massachusetts, of mothers who left welfare for \nwork and then returned to welfare, 35 percent cited child care problems \nas the reason that they do not get enough of it. And the principal \nreason is we have three different child care programs that existed \nunder the Finance Committee, all repealed. We also had a block grant \nprogram that was out there dealing with children of working parents. \nYou had about 760,000 in one, about 650,000 in the other programs. And \nthose programs have been combined and the entitlement status \neliminated. At the same time, the need has been dramatically increased. \nIn the Republican welfare conference, the total amount that is now \nbeing provided is even more inadequate than before. And even though we \nmade some adjustment in this Chamber, that child care program has been \nvery much emasculated.\n  The Republicans have cut by more than 50 percent the funds set aside \nto improve the quality of child care. This is true despite the fact \nthat report after report documents the shockingly poor quality of child \ncare in far too many child care centers and home-based child care \nsettings. These Federal quality funds are making a measurable \ndifference in the growth and development of low-income children.\n  The changes in this bill reduce child safety, parental choice, and \nparental opportunity. They do not promote work or protect children. \nThis bill is not about moving American families from welfare to work. \nIt is about taking assistance away from millions of poor, homeless and \ndisabled children--and passing it out in tax breaks to the rich. It is \nabout starving small children and feeding corporate fat cats. It is \nRobin Hood in reverse.\n  My Republican colleagues are correct when they say that this is a \nhistoric moment. If this bill passes, it will go down in history as the \nday the Congress turned its back on needy children, on poor mothers \nstruggling to make ends meet, on millions of fellow citizens who need \nour help the most.\n  Some may wonder why the Republicans want to jam through a welfare \nconference report that they just managed to twist enough arms to get \nsigned last night? The Republicans put a premium on speed. They hope \nthat no one will find out exactly what their plan means until it is too \nlate. They want to hide the harsh reality. When you strip away their \nrhetoric, their overall budget plan is to punish children and to \nprotect corporate loopholes.\n\n[[Page S19103]]\n\n  Republican priorities are clear. For millionaires, they will move \nmountains.\n  We passed in the Senate under the leadership of Senator Moynihan and \nothers by over 90 votes a repeal of the billionaire's tax cut. This is \nthe provision that allows you to make $4, $5, $6 billion, trade in your \ncitizenship, and get a tax break to take up residency in another \ncountry while the rest of Americans are working hard and paying their \nfair share. We voted overwhelmingly to eliminate it. Only four Members \nactually voted against it. But as soon as they went to conference and \nclosed the door, they put it right back in here. While they are cutting \nchild protection and child nutrition programs, they are protecting the \nbillionaire's tax cut. And that is untenable, Mr. President.\n  Poor children, there is not a finger lifted for them.\n  Some of the Nation's corporate executives purchased full page ads in \nthe Washington Post and the New York Times calling on Congress to \nproduce a budget deal stating that every form of spending should be on \nthe table. I couldn't agree more. It is high time that we had shared \nsacrifice.\n  We all want to balance the budget. But it cannot and should not be \ndone on the backs of America's children. Enough is enough. Enough of \nbackroom deal with high paid corporate lobbyists. Enough of dismantling \ncommitments made to our children and families who need our help.\n  In the end, it is a battle for the heart and soul of this Nation. It \nis a simple question of priorities. Are we going to leave millions of \nAmerican low-income children behind in order to give huge tax breaks to \nthe rich? Are we going to put disabled children back in institutions in \norder to allow corporations to ship their profits overseas.\n  A ``survival of the richest'' plan is not what makes America America.\n  President Kennedy said in his Inaugural Address: ``If a free society \ncannot help the many who are poor, it cannot save the few who are \nrich.''\n  And in defense of the national safety net--President Reagan said in \n1984: ``We can promote economic viability, while showing the \ndisadvantaged genuine compassion.''\n  We have learned from experience that some cuts never heal--and I \ncaution my colleagues that this conference report is full of them.\n  I am proud to join President Clinton and my Democratic colleagues in \nthe House and the Senate vigorously opposing this conference report. \nClearly, we can do better, and now is the time to start trying.\n  For the children who are too young to vote and who cannot speak for \nthemselves--we must be their voice. I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' \non this conference report.\n  I will be glad to yield.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I yield myself 6 minutes to be able to respond, if the \nSenator from Pennsylvania had a question.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I thank the Senator from Massachusetts. I just want to \nclear----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York yields time?\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. To the Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. The Senator from Pennsylvania had inquired earlier, and \nI indicated I wanted to complete my statement, and I have. And the \nSenator from New York has granted I think 2 more minutes--\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. As much time as the Senator likes.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. To respond to the Senator who wanted to ask questions. \nOtherwise, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I would like to ask a question of the Senator from \nMassachusetts. The Senator from Massachusetts made the statement that \nchild care funding under this bill is rolled back, has declined. I \nwould just refer him to--he said we had a premium on speed, and I think \nin this case the premium on speed has been to our detriment because I \nam not sure the Senator has the most current figures on child care. Let \nme review for the Senator what is in the bill.\n  Like the Senate bill that passed, there is a $1 billion per year \nblock grant to the States, identical to what we passed here. There is a \ndifference in the mandatory child care category. We in the Senate-\npassed bill spent $10 billion over 7 years for child care. In the \nconference report it is $11 billion, $1 billion more than the Senate \nbill overall. And in addition, it is over $1.8 billion more than the \ncurrent CBO baseline. So it is more than the Senate bill, and it is \nsubstantially more than what would be under current law.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Well, Mr. President, just to respond, I understand that \nit provides $11 billion over 7 years for child care as opposed to $8 \nbillion over 5 years in the Senate bill. I think I am correct on that. \nI see my friend from New York nodding his head. And CBO says that this \namount is $6 billion short of the funding needed to make the work \nrequirements work. In addition, the conference report caps the child \ncare block grant for working poor families at $1 billion--is that \ncorrect? --rather than such sums as in the Senate bill. So I think I \nstand by the earlier statement. I see the Senator from New York----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. The Senator can have as much time as remains to us, if \nhe wishes.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. If I can say to the Senator from Massachusetts that the \n5-year number is correct, $8 billion over 5 years in the Senate-passed \nbill, but $10 billion over 7 years in the conference report. The \nSenator is correct it is not $8 billion in 5 years; it is $7.8 billion. \nSo you trade off in a sense $200 million in the first 5 years for an \nadditional $1 billion in the final 2 years, which many would see as a \npretty good trade-off and an increase in the overall allocation of $1 \nbillion.\n  So I do not think it is fair to say that it is a decrease in chapter \nfunding when you are spending $1 billion over a year covered by the \nbill.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Well, I say to the Senator, I will put in the Record my \nunderstanding on the child care provisions, as I indicated earlier, the \n$11 billion over 7 years, still far short of what CBO says is needed, \nand also that the cap of the child care block grant. This bill also \nrejects the Senate provisions preserving the funding entitlement for \nall protective services, including essential foster care and adoption \nprograms.\n  As the Senator from Pennsylvania knows, the conference agreement \nmaintains the entitlement for room and board costs associated with \nfoster care and adoption, but block grant the funds used to keep \nchildren safe by removing them from dangerous situations and finding \nand monitoring alternative placements.\n  That is one of the most important aspects of the program. I am \nextremely familiar with the excellent program that is taking place in \nLos Angeles, one of the most effective family preservation programs \naround. With outreach and support efforts, children are being kept safe \nand experiencing good care and attention.\n  The Senate bill emphasized prevention and family preservation. But by \nblock granting these special efforts with crisis intervention programs, \nthese particular provisions have been effectively eliminated. \nIndependent living programs are also repealed. And at a time when the \nneeds will increase in terms of the children protection, the report \ncuts essential services by $1.3 billion more than the Senate bill.\n  We have not even talked about the disabled children, what has \nhappened to them. We have not talked about the food stamp programs that \nare going to affect children. We have not talked about child nutrition. \nYou nearly double the size of the cuts in the Senate bill from $3.4 to \n$5 billion. There are 32 million needy children currently in this \nprogram. And the list goes on.\n  I know the Senator will want to address this. This is a listing of my \nunderstanding of it. I know the Senator from Pennsylvania will do \nlikewise. But I welcome the opportunity to identify the impact of this \nlegislation on children. And what exists at the present time, what was \nin the Senate bill, and what has come out of this conference. I think \nit should be listed, and attention should be drawn to it, hopefully \nprior to the time we vote. I know the Senator will put in his \ninterpretation, as I do mine.\n  I thank the Senator from New York. I yield myself 30 more seconds to \nsay how much all of us appreciate his leadership, not only this evening \nand the work on the conference report, but the \n\n[[Page S19104]]\nbrilliance of his leadership during the consideration earlier in the \ndebate and for all the good work that he has done over the years. In \n1988, his true reform program provided the child care, provided jobs \ntraining and education, and provided for transitional support in terms \nof the health care.\n  That still is, when the final chapter is written, the way to go. All \nof us, all Americans are in his debt for the leadership that he has \nprovided. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, may I yield myself 30 seconds to thank \nmy friend from Massachusetts, who is, as ever, at the fore in these \nmatters.\n  The President in his statement that he will veto this bill says that \nhe looks forward to bipartisan efforts to pursue the directions we took \nin 1988 and on which we should continue. But it is not cheaper. Mr. \nPresident, the cheapest thing to do is what we do now, what we are \ngoing to do in this bill. And it is ruinous to children. We would look \nback at this as a day without precedent in the history of this body, an \nidea that a year ago would have been, I think, unthinkable.\n  I think now we will at long last, when we have come to our senses, as \nI said earlier, in a bipartisan effort accomplish what we need to as \nsoon as this particular one is behind us. I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who seeks recognition?\n  Mr. ROTH. I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from Minnesota.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota is recognized.\n  Mr. GRAMS. I ask the manager of the bill if I could have up to 10 \nminutes?\n  Mr. ROTH. I am sorry, just 5.\n  Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the conference \nreport to H.R. 4, the Work Opportunity Act of 1995, and I commend the \nmajority leader and my colleagues for the months of concentrated effort \nit took to bring us to this point. And I appreciate the opportunity to \nspeak on this bill tonight.\n  Mr. President, since the beginning of the 104th Congress, we have \nbeen debating the state of this Nation's welfare system. Both sides of \nthe aisle recognize that the system is broken.\n  It encourages illegitimacy.\n  It does not recognize the importance of marriage and family. It \noffers no hope or opportunity for those Americans who are trapped \nwithin its layers of bureaucracy.\n  And it was not supposed to be this way.\n  After signing the 1964 Welfare Act, President Lyndon Johnson \nproclaimed, ``We are not content to accept the endless growth of relief \nrolls or welfare rolls,'' and he promised the American people that \n``the days of the dole in our country are numbered.''\n  The New York Times predicted the legislation would lead to ``the \nrestoration of individual dignity and the long-run reduction of the \nneed for government help.''\n  In 1964, America's taxpayers invested $947 million to support welfare \nrecipients--an investment which President Johnson declared would \neventually ``result in savings to the country and especially to the \nlocal taxpayers'' through reductions in welfare caseloads, health care \ncosts, and the crime rate.\n  But yet, 30 years later, none of those predictions have materialized, \nand the failure of the welfare system continues to devastate millions \nof Americans every day--both the families who receive welfare benefits \nand the taxpayers who subsidize them.\n  Despite a $5.4 trillion investment in welfare programs since 1964, at \nan average annual cost that had risen to $3,357 per taxpaying household \nby 1993:\n  One in three children in the U.S. today is born out-of-wedlock;\n  One child in seven is being raised on welfare through the Aid to \nFamilies with Dependent Children program; and\n  Our crime rate has increased 280 percent.\n   Mr. President, those are the kinds of devastating statistics which \nuntil recently have been ignored by the bureaucratic establishment in \nWashington, but those are the statistics H.R. 4 will finally address.\n  By rewriting Federal policies and working in close partnership with \nthe States, we can create a welfare system which will effectively \nrespond to the needs of those who depend on it--at the same time to \nprotect the taxpayers.\n  This bipartisan welfare conference report sets in place the framework \nfor meeting those needs by offering individuals who are down on their \nluck some opportunity, self-respect and most importantly, the ability \nto take control of their own lives.\n  And yes, we will ask something of them in return.\n  The most significant change in our welfare system will be the \nrequirement that able-bodied individuals put in 20 hours of work every \nweek before they receive assistance from America's taxpayers.\n  Mr. President, my colleagues and I have come to the floor repeatedly \nthis session to suggest that our present welfare system promotes \ndependency by discouraging recipients from working, but nothing sums up \nthe problem more perfectly than a story which appeared just last month \nin the Baltimore Sun.\n  It seems that the Baltimore regional office of the Salvation Army is \nhaving trouble this year recruiting volunteer bell ringers to staff the \nred kettles that have become a symbol of the holiday season.\n  So they decided to pay for the help--$5 an hour, thinking it would \ngive people on public assistance the opportunity to earn some money. \nHere is where the Baltimore Sun picks up the story:\n\n       The Frederick chapter ran a help-wanted ad for bell ringers \n     in the local paper for a week but received only four \n     applications. It then approached an agency that provides \n     temporary workers.\n       The agency interviewed 25 people for the bell ringing job, \n     but no one wanted to do it. One person accepted the job at a \n     second temporary help agency.\n       ``I'm beating my head against the wall,'' Captain Mallard \n     said.\n\n  That is Butch Mallard, commander of the Salvation Army in Frederick, \nMD:\n\n       I don't know if people don't want to work outside, or that \n     they just don't want to work for $5 an hour when they can \n     stay home and get that much from the government.\n\n  Mr. President, the Salvation Army has found out what we have been \nsaying all along: the government makes it so easy for a welfare \nrecipient to skip the work and continue collecting a federal check that \nthere is absolutely no incentive to ever get out of the house and find \na job.\n  And if someone actually takes the initiative to take a job--perhaps \nas a bell ringer--they risk forfeiting their welfare benefits entirely.\n  During Senate consideration of the Work Opportunity Act, Senator \nShelby and I joined forces with the majority leader to ensure that \nwelfare recipients receive benefits only after they work.\n  We believe welfare recipients should be held to the same standards, \nthe same work ethic, to which America's taxpayers are held.\n  American taxpayers are putting in at least 40 hours on the job each \nweek--and are sometimes forced to take on an additional job or work \novertime hours just to make ends meet.\n  And all the while, they have been generously providing welfare \nrecipients with cash and benefit assistance, while the only thing we \nask of welfare recipients is to provide an address where we can mail \ntheir checks.\n  Under the Grams-Shelby pay-for-performance amendment which was \nadopted earlier this year, this practice will end. Welfare recipients \nwill be required to work before they receive any cash assistance.\n  Simply put, our amendment stipulates that welfare recipients will \nreceive financial assistance from the taxpayers only for the number of \nhours they are actually engaged in a work activity.\n  A work activity includes: a private sector job, on-the-job-training, \na subsidized job, workfare, community service, job search limited to 4 \nweeks, and vocational education limited to 1 year.\n  A welfare recipient is required to required to work 20 hours a week--\nif they only put in 15 hours in a particular week, they will only \nreceive cash assistance for those 15 hours of work.\n  Many of my colleagues have expressed their support for these tough \nwork requirements and the need for the pay-for-performance amendment.\n  But some Members believe our original bill did not include adequate \nfunding to provide child care while parents were working.\n  These concerns were raised despite the fact that the Senate bill \ndedicated $8 billion toward child care services. \n\n[[Page S19105]]\n\n  But in order to address the concerns that $8 billion is still not \nenough, the conference report increases child care funding to $18 \nbillion.\n  As it has in the past, safeguarding the well-being of children will \ncontinue to remain a primary concern of the re-focused welfare system \nour bill will create.\n  I am proud that we have taken additional steps through this \nconference report to ensure our children's readiness, and ability, to \nlearn.\n  Throughout the last year, I have been meeting with parents, \neducators, nutrition experts and pediatricians who are concerned about \nthe future of Federal nutrition standards.\n  Many of them have pointed out that unless children receive and \nmaintain a proper level of nutrition, they will perform significantly \nlower than their learning potential.\n  And so I have worked to ensure that medically devised Federal \nnutrition standards, established by the National Advisory Council on \nMaternal, Infant and Fetal Nutrition, are maintained under this \nlegislation.\n  I am pleased that my colleagues have joined me in recognizing the \nneed for these uniform standards by including them in this bill.\n  Mr. President, our bill also recognizes that officials elected \nlocally--our state legislators and governors--are more capable than \ntheir representatives in far-away Washington to administer effective \nprograms on the State and local level.\n  And so this welfare reform legislation will give States like \nMinnesota the flexibility they need to develop innovative programs to \nassist those who need help most.\n  States will no longer have to ask Washington for permission to \nestablish successful programs like the Minnesota family investment \nplan. States will finally be able to save money and use it wisely, \nrather than being forced to spend it on the wasteful paperwork \nWashington requires them to fill out.\n  Mr. President, the bipartisan legislation before us today to overhaul \nour failed welfare system is the first positive step away from a system \nwhich has held nearly three generations hostage with little hope of \nescape.\n  Only be enacting this legislation can we offer these Americans a way \nout and a way up.\n  I challenge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle, and the \nPresident, and the American people themselves, to take this message to \nheart: Government cannot solve all our problems.\n  As Americans, we need to look within ourselves rather than continuing \nto look to Washington for solutions.\n  Does anybody really believe the Federal Government embodies \ncompassion, that it has a heart?\n  Of course not--those are qualities found only outside Washington, in \nAmerica's communities.\n  Mr. President, there is no one I can think of who better exemplifies \nheart and compassion than Corla Wilson-Hawkins, and I was so fortunate \nto have had the opportunity to meet her recently.\n  She was one of 21 recipients of the 1995 National Caring Awards for \nher outstanding volunteer service to her community.\n  Corla is known as ``Mama Hawk'' because, more than anything else, she \nhas become a second mother to hundreds of schoolchildren in her west-\nside Chicago community, children who, without her guidance, might go \nwithout meals, or homes, or a loving hug.\n  Mama Hawk gives them all that and more, and she and the many, many \nother caring Americans just like her represent the good we can \naccomplish when ordinary folks look inward, not to the government--and \nfollow their hearts, not the trail of tax dollars to Washington.\n  Mama Hawk tells a story that illustrates better than I ever could how \nthe present welfare system has permeated our culture and become as \ningrained as the very problems it was originally created to solve.\n  These are her words.\n\n       When I first started teaching, I asked my kids, what did \n     they want to be when they grew up? What kind of job they \n     wanted. Most of them said they wanted to be on public aid. I \n     was a little stunned.\n       I said, ``Public aid--I didn't realize that was a form of \n     employment.'' They said, ``Well, our mom's on public aid. \n     They make a lot of money and, if you have a baby, they get a \n     raise.''\n\n  Mr. President, that is the perception, maybe even the reality, we're \nfighting to change with our vote today on this historic conference \nreport. While there is more work to accomplish, this bill is a good \nfirst step toward truly ending welfare as we know it.\n  I look forward to working with my colleagues in the future to finish \nthe good work we have started today.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I oppose this conference report. We \nshould reject this bill. We should return to the bargaining table to \nnegotiate real welfare reform which moves people from welfare to work \nand provides a safety net for kids.\n  Nearly 3 months ago, I joined 34 of my Democratic colleagues in \nreaching across the aisle to pass a bipartisan welfare reform bill by a \nvote of 87-12.\n  We did so because our deliberations had produced a bill that began to \nmove the welfare reform debate away from the harsh rhetoric of the \nHouse bill.\n  I had hoped that our initial success at compromise in the Senate \ncould lead to true compromise with the House. Regrettably, it did not.\n  During Senate action last September, Senate Republicans and Democrats \nworked together to find common ground and the sensible center. In \ncontrast, the House-Senate welfare conference was shaped by Republican \nback room deals. Democrats were shut out.\n  This Conference Report is punitive. It's tough on kids, and it does \nnot give people the tools they need to get and keep a job.\n  This bill moves us in the wrong direction.\n  First, this bill is part of the Republican assault on needy families. \nThis bill cuts $82 billion from child care, food stamps, child \nnutrition, child protection, welfare and other programs over 7 years--\ndrastically more than the Senate welfare reform bill. These cuts are \ndraconian.\n  They are coupled with other budget cuts critical to working families, \nsuch as the earned income tax credit. The EITC helps keep working \nfamilies out of poverty. The Republicans welfare plan says go to work. \nThe Republican budget says, once you get to work, we're going to make \nyou pay more in taxes.\n  Second, the conference report snatches away the safety net for kids. \nIt weakens the Senate effort to provide child care to working families \nby cutting $1.2 billion. These drastic cuts mean that parents will have \nto choose between taking care of their kids and going to work. Today, \n34 percent of women on welfare say they are not working because they \ncannot find or afford child care.\n  Children will go hungry under this conference report. It jeopardizes \nthe nutrition and health of millions of children, working families, and \nthe elderly. It cuts food stamps and school lunches. And, if there is a \nrecession, there is no guarantee those in need can get either. At least \n14 million kids will suffer from this cut.\n  Third, neglected and abandoned children, and children in foster and \nadoptive care, will suffer further under this conference report. It \nslashes protective services to these kids by 23 percent or $4.6 billion \nover the next 7 years. The bill also cuts funding to investigate \nreports of abuse and neglect, to train potential foster and adoptive \nparents, to help place children in foster and adoptive homes and to \nmonitor State child protection programs. These cuts come at a time when \nresources can't meet current needs to protect children from abuse and \nneglect.\n  Fourth, the conference agreement is punitive to disabled children. We \nall agree Supplemental Security Income needs to be reformed. But, this \ngoes too far. It too narrowly defines who qualifies. So, only the most \nseverely disabled children will get SSI, stranding many disabled kids \nand their families.\n  Fifth, the conference report allows States to cut back on their \nfinancial commitment to poor families. It weakens the State maintenance \nof effort provisions the Senate fought so hard for. Under this bill \nStates could cut their contributions to poor families by 25 percent \neach year. The net effect--less child care, fewer tools to help get \npeople to work, and more children falling into poverty.\n  And sixth, the bill fails to recognize that when there is an economic \ndownturn, people lose their jobs and need a helping hand. There is not \nan adequate contingency fund for use during times \n\n[[Page S19106]]\nof natural disasters, changes in child poverty, and population shifts.\n  This bill fails to move people from welfare to work. And it is a bill \nthat will force more than a million additional children into poverty.\n  The welfare package of the President's 7-year balanced budget plan is \na good place to start. It takes a significant page from the Work First \nproposal that Senators Daschle, Breaux, and I wrote earlier this year. \nIt requires welfare recipients to go to work by providing them with the \ntools to get a job and keep it. It cuts $49 billion in welfare \nprograms, but does so responsibly--not in the reckless and punitive \nfashion of this conference report.\n  The best social program in America is a job. Unfortunately, the \nRepublicans welfare bill now before the Senate is a con job when it \ncomes to Americans' desire to get welfare recipients back to work. Vote \nno on this conference report.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. I yield myself 3 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, we are truly at the end of our debate \nthis evening, toward the end. I ask unanimous consent that statement by \nthe presidents of the National League of Cities, the National \nAssociation of Counties, and the United States Conference of Mayors \nurging the defeat of this measure be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n         National League of Cities, National Association of \n           Counties, The United States Conference of Mayors, \n           December 20, 1995.\n       Dear Senator: On behalf of the nation's local elected \n     officials, we are writing to urge you to oppose H.R. 4, the \n     conference agreement on the Personal Responsibility Act. \n     Although the conferees agreed to some changes in the areas of \n     foster care consultation with local governments, we cannot \n     support the Final conference agreement which fails to address \n     many of the other significant concerns of local governments. \n     In particular, we object to the following provisions:\n       The bill ends the entitlement of Aid to Families with \n     Depend Children, thereby dismantling the critical safety net \n     for children and their families.\n       The bill places foster care administration and training \n     into a block grant. These funds provide basic services to our \n     most vulnerable children. If administration and training do \n     not remain an individual entitlement, our agencies will not \n     have sufficient funds to provide the necessary child \n     protective services, thereby placing more children at risk.\n       The eligibility restrictions for legal immigrants go too \n     far and will shift substantial cost into local governments. \n     The most objectionable provisions include denying \n     Supplemental Security Income and Food Stamps, particularly to \n     older immigrants. Local governments cannot and should not be \n     the safety net for federal policy decisions regarding \n     immigration.\n       The work participation requirements are unrealistic, and \n     funding for child care and job training is not sufficient to \n     meet these requirements, One example of the impracticality of \n     these provisions is the removal of Senate language that would \n     have allowed states to require lower hours of partition for \n     parents with children under age six.\n       We remain very concerned with the possibility of any block \n     granting of child nutrition programs. A strong federal role \n     in child nutrition would continue to ensure an adequate level \n     of nutrition assistance to children and their families. \n     School lunch programs are necessary to ensure that children \n     receive the nutrition they need to succeed in school. \n     Children's educational success is essential to the economic \n     well being of our nation's local communities.\n       The implementation dates and transition periods are \n     inadequate to make the changes necessary to comply with the \n     legislation. We suggest delaying them until the next fiscal \n     year.\n       As the level of government closets to the people, local \n     elected officials understand the importance of reforming the \n     welfare system. However, the welfare reform conference \n     agreement would shift costs and liabilities and create new \n     unfunded mandates for local governments, as well as penalize \n     low income families. Such a bill, in combination with federal \n     cuts and increased demands for services, will leave local \n     governments with two options: cut other essential services, \n     such as law enforcement, or raise revenues. We, therefore, \n     urge you to vote against the conference agreement on H.R. 4.\n           Sincerely,\n     Gregory S. Lashutka,\n       President, National League of Cities, Mayor, Columbus, \n     Ohio.\n     Douglas R. Bovin,\n       President, National Association of Counties, Commissioner, \n     Delta County, Michigan.\n     Norman B. Rice,\n       President, The United States Conference on Mayors, Mayor, \n     Seattle, Washington.\n\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, they make a number of points, but the \nfirst one being:\n\n       The bill ends the entitlement of Aid to Families with \n     Dependent Children, thereby dismantling the critical safety \n     net for children and their families.\n\n  This is the central point. We do not have welfare reform before us, \nwe have welfare repeal, a repeal of a commitment made in the 1930's in \nthe middle of the Depression. To be abandoned now would be unthinkable, \nand I am increasingly confident it will not occur.\n  Also, I ask unanimous consent to print in the Record a joint \nstatement by Catholic Charities USA, the Lutheran Social Ministry \nOrganizations of the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America, the \nSalvation Army, and the Young Women's Christian Association on these \nand other matters.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n Joint Statement of Large Nonprofit Social Service Providers, October \n                                19, 1995\n\n       Catholic Charities USA, the Lutheran Social Ministry \n     Organizations of the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America \n     (ELCA), The Salvation Army, and the Young Women's Christian \n     Association (YWCA) are the nonprofit organizations who \n     together do more for low-income families and poor people in \n     the United States than anyone else. We are greatly concerned \n     about the consequences that deep cuts in programs that serve \n     poor and low-income people will likely create. The very \n     fabric of our society is at risk. We believe that such cuts \n     will exacerbate the despair already felt among many and turn \n     it into hopelessness. As we go about our business of serving \n     both the physical and spiritual needs of people, we see the \n     desperation in many of their eyes.\n       The chasm between the rich and poor in our country appears \n     to be growing. While children born to families in the upper \n     twenty percent of the income scale in the United States \n     experience the highest standard of living in the \n     industrialized world, the children born to families in the \n     lowest twenty percent receive one of the lowest. We should be \n     developing policy that narrows that gap rather than policy \n     that widens it. The reduction in the support for programs \n     serving low-income people such as Aid to Families with \n     Dependent Children, food and nutrition, Medicaid, housing, \n     the Legal Services Corporation, Supplemental Security Income, \n     and the Earned Income Tax Credit, when combined, will have a \n     devastating effect on families that have few options. Even if \n     these families are able to work, that work is often at or \n     near minimum wage with no benefits leaving families still \n     living in terrible deprivation. Elderly people as well will \n     experience increased poverty and all that it brings.\n       In addition to the hopelessness of spirit, we believe the \n     proposed policy changes will increase hunger, homelessness, \n     and abuse and neglect within families.\n       Historically, we have worked quite successfully in \n     partnership with government to provide services to persons \n     with special needs. On every front we have received \n     commendation for the great work we have done. However, we do \n     not have either the financial or physical capacity to serve \n     the increased need we expect to occur because of these policy \n     changes. In fact some of the changes may force us to \n     terminate some programs and even close our doors in some \n     ares. We are deeply concerned that the partnership between \n     government and religious institutions, which has worked so \n     well in the past, is now being broken.\n       We will do our part to alleviate as much suffering as \n     possible by our acts of mercy. However, we believe that all \n     have a responsibility for the needs of the people, the \n     general welfare, the common good--church members and non-\n     church members alike. Because not all seek what is just and \n     good, dependence on charity for the basic needs of life is \n     inadequate. Charity can supplement, but it will never be able \n     to replace ``justice.'' It is not just the responsibility of \n     faith group members who choose to give generously of both \n     their time and resources to ensure that people's needs are \n     met. Society as a whole must be committed to the well being \n     of all. We believe that government, as a means by which \n     Americans act corporately, has a major role in establishing \n     justice, protecting and advancing human rights, and providing \n     for the general welfare of all. This is not a time for \n     government to deny their role and reduce their portion of the \n     partnership.\n       We believe that Congress and the President should be \n     cautious when making sweeping changes in policy and not \n     reverse the present working relationship with nonprofit \n     providers which has worked so well in the past.\n     Rev. Charles Miller,\n       Executive Director, Lutheran Social Ministry Organizations \n     of the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America.\n     \n[[Page S19107]]\n\n     Rev. Fred Kammer, S.J.,\n       President, Catholic Charities USA.\n     Commissioner Kenneth L. Hodder,\n       National Commander, The Salvation Army.\n     Preme Mathai-Davis,\n       Executive Director, YWCA of the U.S.A.\n\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. I reserve the remainder of my time as I believe we are \ngoing to try to go to a concluding measure here.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, first, I yield 5 minutes to the \ndistinguished Senator from Texas.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas is recognized.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Thank you, Mr. President. I thank the distinguished \nchairman of the committee for the wonderful job that he has done. It is \nnever easy to make such changes as we are making in this bill. But it \nis one of the most important decisions that we will make, because it is \none of the key elements to change the direction of this country as it \nrelates to welfare and to allow us to balance the budget.\n  We have heard a lot of talk this afternoon and this evening about \nhelping children. Mr. President, if we are going to help the children \nof this country, the most important thing we can do is balance the \nbudget. We cannot balance the budget unless we put welfare on a budget. \nIf we do not put welfare on a budget, we will not be able to do what is \nright for this country.\n  I am voting yes on this conference report for two reasons: We must \ntake welfare off entitlement status and, Mr. President, we have talked \nall day and all night about the President saying he is going to veto \nthis bill. There is one reason he is going to veto this bill. It is \nbecause we are taking welfare off entitlement status and putting it on \na budget. That is the fundamental difference between the President and \nthose of us who are going to support this bill.\n  This bill does not cut welfare spending. This bill slows the rate of \ngrowth of welfare spending from 5.8 percent to 4.02 percent, less than \n2 percentage points of difference in the rate of growth. We are going \nto spend more on welfare. But the difference is we are going to put \nsome parameters around it. We are going to give the States the right to \nhave a welfare program that fits the needs of their States.\n  Mr. President, my Governor, George Bush, says, ``What are they \ntalking about, hurting the children? Do they think I am going to have \nstarving children in my home State?\"\n  My Governor is a graduate of Yale. I mean, it is not the University \nof Texas, but it is OK. I think he is enlightened. I think he can \nhandle the job, and I think every other Governor in the United States \nof America knows best what will fit their State's needs.\n  This is going to make some monumental changes in the priorities we \nhave. We have heard tonight Senators saying, ``What are the priorities \nof this country?'' We are going to decide.\n  The priorities of this country are that we want to help people who \nneed a transition for a temporary period, and that is what this bill \ndoes. Can people stay on welfare if they are able-bodied and do not \nhave young children under 6? They cannot do it forever. No, they \ncannot. They cannot stay on it generation to generation. They have to \nwork after 2 years and they have a lifetime limitation of 5 years.\n  What does that tell working people of this country, especially the \nworking poor? It says there is an incentive for you to do what is \nright. No longer are you going to have to support people who can work \nbut will not. If you can work and do, if you consider it a privilege to \nwork and contribute to the economy of this country, you will not be \nsubsidizing people who can work and do not.\n  We have talked about what is a block grant and what is not a block \ngrant. We are going to put AFDC on a block grant with growth. There is \na formula that allows for the growth States to have a fair allocation. \nBut there still is a safety net, Mr. President. There is a safety net \nin food stamps, in child nutrition. Those will not be block granted. \nThose are going to be based on need. So food and nutrition programs are \na safety net, and they are kept in the bill as a safety net.\n  Mr. President, we are going to set the priorities of our country with \nthis bill. We are going to say to the working people of this country \nthat it is worth something to work, it is a privilege in this country \nto have a job and to contribute to the economy and you are not going to \nbe competing with someone who refuses to work even if they can. The \nworking people of this country are going to know that we have a budget \nand that this is not going to be unlimited spending.\n  Mr. President, I know that my time is up, and I will just say that we \nare making decisions that will determine the priorities of our country \nand we are going to get this country back on track and we are going to \nbring back what made this country great.\n  It was the strong families, it was the spirit of entrepreneurship and \nthe working relationships that have built this country. We are going to \nbring it back and make this country strong again.\n  Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor and thank the chairman.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I yield the remainder of my time to the \ndistinguished Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania is recognized \nfor 18 minutes, 52 seconds.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I want to thank the distinguished \nchairman of the committee who has done an absolutely superb job with \nthis piece of legislation in shepherding it through the conference. It \nhas been a pleasure to work with him in the time we have worked on the \nwelfare bill since he has become chairman.\n  For the benefit of the staff here, I am going to do the wrap-up and \nthen proceed with my remarks after the wrap-up.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/12/21/senate-section/article/S19086-1", "month": "12", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "21", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S19107]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. SANTORUM.

STENNIS\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to Senator \nJohn C. Stennis, for whom our Nation's newest aircraft carrier is \nnamed. Further, I include in today's Record the excellent remarks given \nby the Secretary of Defense, William Perry, and Senator Thad Cochran, \nthe two principal speakers at the commissioning of this great ship on \nDecember 9, 1995.\n  Built with the minds, hands, and sweat of thousands of workers at \nNewport News Shipbuilding, and manned by the men and women of the most \npowerful Navy in today's world, this ship serves as an symbol of peace, \nthat will stand guard night and day on the seven seas deterring \naggression. As a former sailor in World War II, Secretary of the Navy, \nand now a senior member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, I know \nwell the awesome capabilities of these magnificent ships.\n  In my brief remarks to an impressive audience of over ten thousand \npeople who braved a wintery day, I recalled how, as I worked by his \nside for over a decade, Senator Stennis would relate stories of how a \nsuccession of Presidents would say ``Whenever I was awakened in the \nmiddle of the night by a report of a crisis somewhere in the world, my \nfirst thoughts were always `Where is the nearest U.S. aircraft \ncarrier?' ''\n  Mr. President, it is fitting that this great ship bears the name of \nSenator Stennis. Senator Stennis was my friend and mentor, whose humble \nbeginnings in a small working-class home and equally humble and proud \nmanner in which he lived his entire life, stand in stark contrast to \nthis magnificent ship that now bears his name. He was a true visionary \nand champion of our Nation's \n\n[[Page S19108]]\nArmed Forces. When Senator Stennis left the Senate, he gave me a plaque \nwhich was always on his desk. While the plaque itself may be simple and \nplain, the message ``Look ahead'' has deep meaning. Indeed, even today, \nour Nation is reaping the benefits of the forward thinking Senator who \nlived by these words.\n  Mr. President, during the commissioning ceremony of the USS John C. \nStennis, attended by many Members of Congress including Senators Strom \nThurmond, Thad Cochran, Trent Lott, Chuck Robb, Sam Nunn, and Dirk \nKempthorne, and Congressmen Sonny Montgomery, Owen Pickett, Herb \nBateman, Bobby Scott, and Gene Taylor, I was honored to be able to \npresent the ship with that plaque, as I am sure Senator Stennis would \nhave wanted, in hopes that it would inspire the gnerations of men and \nwomen that will serve on her.\n  I ask unamious consent that Senator Cochran's and Secretary Perry's \nremarks be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the remarks were order to be printed in the \nRecord as follows:\n\n  Remarks of Senator Thad Cochran at the Commissioning of the U.S.S. \n                      ``John C. Stennis'' (CVN-74)\n\n       Those of us from the State of Mississippi could not be more \n     proud today. We are all honored by the career and life of \n     John C. Stennis.\n       When he was elected to the United States Senate in 1947, an \n     editor of one of our newspapers said our State would ``earn \n     the plaudits of the Nation'' by choosing such ``a thoughtful, \n     purposeful, and high-minded man.''\n       That turned out to be very true indeed. Integrity was not \n     just a virtue with John Stennis, it was a way of life. For \n     that he was greatly admired.\n       With all his good personal qualities, he had an enormous \n     capacity for hard work and endurance. His personal toughness \n     as well as his courage and determination was greatly tested \n     when he was shot by robbers in 1973, and then later when \n     serious health problems threatened his life.\n       He not only survived, he prevailed, as William Faulkner \n     might say, and he did so without complaint or any noticeable \n     ill humor.\n       John Stennis was always in good spirits, friendly with all \n     his colleagues, the epitome of decorum and courtesy. In the \n     ten years I was privileged to be his State colleague in the \n     Senate, I never heard him say a critical or unkind word about \n     anybody.\n       But he was tough minded, resolute, and firm, like he had \n     been as a trial judge, insisting on order and respect for the \n     Court, and later the Senate. The judicial temperament he \n     exhibited included a strong respect for justice and fairness.\n       It is no wonder then that as a young Senator he was chosen \n     to serve as the first chairman of the Committee on Standards \n     and Conduct.\n       His effective work as chairman of the Subcommittee on \n     Military Preparedness gave him his first opportunity to \n     develop expertise in national defense matters. When he later \n     chaired the Armed Services and Appropriations Committees, he \n     helped authorize and fund what all now recognize as the \n     mightiest military force in the world, distinguished from all \n     others by our nuclear powered aircraft carriers.\n       As the officers and crew of this fine ship carry out their \n     duties, I know that they will be challenged and strengthened \n     by the example of this ship's namesake, John C. Stennis. It \n     is the kind of ship that appropriately bears his name. It is \n     robust, well made in all respects, and ready and able to meet \n     every challenge. May it be God's will that it will do so \n     safely.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\nRemarks of Secretary William Perry at the Commissioning of the USS John \n                          C. Stennis (CVN-74)\n\n       Admiral Boorda and Secretary Dalton have both rightly said \n     that the United States Navy is the most powerful in the \n     world. I want to tell you that that is not simply rhetoric, \n     it is a statement of fact. And the ship we're commissioning \n     today, U.S.S. JOHN C. STENNIS, will be the most powerful \n     warship in the world.\n       Two hundred and twenty years ago, this very day, America \n     learned its first lesson on why our Nation needs a powerful \n     Navy. For on that day, only a few miles from here, the battle \n     of Great Bridge began. It was the first military engagement \n     of the Revolutionary War in the Virginia colony. American \n     forces won this battle. But, afterwards, the defeated British \n     forces proceeded to bombard the city of Norfolk, with their \n     cannons, from the sea. The American forces were helpless to \n     stop them because we had no Navy.\n       Throughout that year, 1775, some members of the Continental \n     Congress had been opposed to trying to build a Navy. In fact, \n     one member, Samuel Chase, remarked, ``Building an American \n     navy is the maddest idea in the world.'' His views were \n     countered by John Paul Jones, who said, ``Without a \n     respectable navy, alas America.''\n       Incidents like the bombardment of Norfolk showed that not \n     having an American navy was the maddest idea in the world. \n     So, the views of John Paul Jones prevailed over the views of \n     Samuel Chase and America did build a respectable Navy.\n       By the time of the Second World War, our respectable Navy \n     had become a global naval power. And this naval power helped \n     defeat the forces of totalitarianism on two sides of the \n     globe. And all during the Cold War, our global naval power \n     contained the forces of Soviet expansionism. Today, we are \n     adding another great ship to our global naval power--a ship \n     that will help project and defend America's interests for the \n     next fifty years. The John C. Stennis is America's seventh \n     Nimitz class carrier. Both of these names, Nimitz and \n     Stennis, capture the glorious history of our Navy in this \n     century.\n       Fifty years ago, Admiral Chester Nimitz commanded our \n     Pacific force. It was that war that witnessed the emergence \n     of the aircraft carrier as a powerful tool for the most \n     powerful nation. Then, through 50 years of the Cold War, \n     Senator John Stennis saw to it that America's Navy \n     remained the most powerful in the world. He has been \n     called the father of America's modern Navy, because, when \n     John Stennis said, ``America needs this ship,'' Congress \n     listened. Senator Warner has told you that one of Senator \n     Stennis's favorite sayings was, ``Look ahead,'' and it is \n     fitting that this saying has become the unofficial motto \n     of U.S.S. John C. Stennis. Because at the end of the Cold \n     War, there are some who ask why America still needs ships \n     like John C. Stennis, and the answer to their question is, \n     ``Look ahead.''\n       When you look ahead, you see that America will remain a \n     global power with global interests, that America will \n     continue to face threats to its interests, and that \n     protecting these interests requires a powerful presence in \n     many places around the world. A critical way of getting that \n     presence is by having a strong Navy. And no Navy ship has \n     more presence than a Nimitz class aircraft carrier.\n       Let me give you an example of what forward presence does \n     for our security. The U.S.S. Theodore Roosevelt, \n     affectionately called ``TR''--another Nimitz class carrier--\n     recently led a battle group through a six month deployment. \n     When it started out, last March, it first went to the Arabian \n     Gulf to enforce the no-fly-zone over southern Iraq. Then, it \n     sailed to the Mediterranean to conduct routine exercises with \n     our allies and friends in the area--exercises that improve \n     the ability of our forces and other nations to work together. \n     At the same time, ``TR'' supported NATO's Deny Flight \n     operations--enforcing the no-fly-zone over the former \n     Yugoslavia. Then, in August, several members of Saddam \n     Hussein's family defected to Jordan and the world worried \n     that Saddam might lash out at his neighbors. To deter this \n     potential aggressor, we moved ``TR'' to the eastern Med and \n     repositioned an amphibious force in the Red Sea. These \n     forward deployed forces with credible combat power sent \n     Saddam a message, loud and clear. Soon after this crisis died \n     down, ``TR'' rushed back to the Adriatic Sea to conduct NATO \n     air strikes over Bosnia. And, as we all know, these air \n     strikes played a critical role in bringing the parties to the \n     bargaining table in Dayton.\n       So, on one deployment, for six months, ``TR'' improved our \n     ability to operate with our allies; helped a friend in need; \n     deterred Saddam Hussein; and helped create an opportunity for \n     ending the deadliest fighting in Europe since World War II.\n       As we look ahead, it is clear that deployments like these \n     will not be uncommon for our carriers. And, as we realize \n     this, we must also recognize that this craft is not just a \n     fast, powerful vessel with fast, powerful aircraft. Instead, \n     it is four and a half acres of American turf, off the coast \n     of any trouble spot in the world we send it to. In other \n     words, it's not just a floating runway for airplanes, it is a \n     mobile island of American power. An island we can rush to \n     anywhere our interests are threatened and use to do anything \n     needed to support our operations.\n       In addition to using it for large, powerful air strikes, we \n     can use it to launch a team of Navy SEALs. We can use it as a \n     joint command and control center to shape the battlefield in \n     almost any theater. And, as Admiral Paul David Miller showed \n     us last year, when we went into Haiti, we can even use it as \n     a launching pad for the 10th Mountain Division troops and \n     Army helicopters.\n       But, even with these tremendous capabilities, this carrier \n     is still only as good as the men and women who will operate \n     it. Admiral Nimitz himself said, ``There is simply no \n     substitute for good seamanship.'' A ship like this carrier \n     requires intelligent, dedicated, well trained people. People \n     like Captain Robert Klosterman, who will very soon command \n     this ship, and the officers and the crew who are handpicked \n     to join him.\n       I have great confidence that the John C. Stennis is one of \n     the most capable ships in the world. I have equally great \n     confidence that this crew is one of the best groups of \n     sailors in the world. Captain Klosterman and his crew will \n     present some of the world's most sophisticated and deadly \n     equipment. They not only have to operate this equipment, they \n     also have to maintain it. There are no Maytag repairmen on \n     the open seas. And that is why it is essential for our \n     sailors to have the best training available. And once we \n     train them, we need to keep them in the Navy. To do that, we \n     need to treat them right and we must take care of their \n     families as they weather the strain of having a parent or \n     spouse away from home. And that is why the title that we \n     invest in our sailors quality \n\n[[Page S19109]]\n     of life. Caring about our people--giving them decent pay, housing, and \n     medical care--is not just the right thing to do, it is also \n     the smart thing to do, because it is vital to maintaining the \n     quality and readiness of our forces.\n       Finally, let us remember, on this holiday season, that many \n     of our servicemen and women are deployed in the \n     Mediterranean, the Adriatic, and in Yugoslavia. Still more \n     are on their way. They are all preparing to support the peace \n     Implementation Force in Bosnia. It is a tough assignment for \n     them. It is even tougher on their families. So as we \n     celebrate this year, let us all pray for the safety of our \n     soldiers, sailors, airmen, and Marines performing these \n     difficult missions. And let us also pray for their comrades--\n     some 150,000 of them--who will also spend their holidays away \n     from their loved ones as they perform other missions for \n     peace and freedom around the globe.\n       Next to my office in the Pentagon is a painting depicting a \n     soldier, he's in a church praying with his family just before \n     a deployment. Underneath this painting are the lines from the \n     Bible, in which God says, ``Whom shall I send and who will go \n     for us?'' And, Isaiah answers, ``Here am I. Send me.'' This \n     Christmas, our Nation asks, ``Whom shall I send?'' And, \n     150,000 of our military personnel answered, ``Here am I. Send \n     me.'' These military personnel are America's finest and they \n     deserve the prayers and support of all Americans.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/12/21/senate-section/article/S19107-3", "month": "12", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "21", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S19109]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             PATRICK T. ALLEN: DEDICATED TO SOUTH CAROLINA\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I rise today to remember and to thank \nPatrick R. Allen for his 25-year career as head of the Central Electric \nPower Cooperative in my home State. Pat is retiring in January and \nhe'll be sorely missed.\n  Central Electric plays a critical role in the lives of thousands of \nSouth Carolinians. It is a wholesale supplier for 15 rural electric \ncooperatives in South Carolina, which in turn supply electricity to \nmore than 345,000 residential, commercial and industrial customers in \ntwo-thirds of the State. Pat Allen's role in steering Central Electric \nhas been critical.\n  Pat moved to South Carolina from his native Texas in 1970 to take a \njob as manager of engineering and construction with Central Electric. \nHe became president and chief executive officer in 1975. The company \nhas grown tremendously under his leadership and moved from a one-floor \noffice in the Farm Bureau Building in Cayce to its present home in \nColumbia.\n  Pat introduced the first computers to Central and wrote the original \nprograms. He installed an economic development department, which later \nbecame the nucleus of a successful new venture, Palmetto Economic \nDevelopment Corp. Now, the spin-off company represents Central Electric \nand another public service company, Santee Cooper, in its economic \ndevelopment mission.\n  Pat introduced many marketing concepts to Central's member \ncooperative that have earned national recognition for their proactive \nand aggressive approaches.\n  Mr. President, I appreciate the opportunity to recognize the years of \ndevotion and strong leadership that Pat has brought to Central Electric \nand its customers. I wish him and his wife JoAnne all the best during \nPat's retirement and hope they have many more happy years to come.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/12/21/senate-section/article/S19109-1", "month": "12", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "21", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S19109]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Thomas, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/12/21/senate-section/article/S19109-2", "month": "12", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "21", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S19109]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/12/21/senate-section/article/S19109-3", "month": "12", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "21", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S19109-S19110]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 9:33 a.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mr. Hays, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bill and joint resolution, in which it requests \nthe concurrence of the Senate.\n\n       H.R. 2704.

A bill to amend title 18, United States Code, to prohibit \ncertain interstate conduct relating to exotic animals; to the Committee \non the Judiciary.\n\n\n            THE CAPTIVE EXOTIC ANIMAL PROTECTION ACT OF 1995\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, today I am introducing the Capitive \nExotic Animal Protection Act of 1995, a bill to stop what are known as \ncanned hunts--the cruel and inhumane business in which a customer pays \nto shoot a tame, captive exotic animal in a fenced-in enclosure for \nentertainment, or to collect a trophy.\n  Mr. President, canned hunts do not involve hunting, tracking, or \nshooting skills. In such an operation, the client merely hands over a \ncheck, walks to within yards of his prize, aims carefully to avoid the \nhead, and shoots, killing the unsuspecting exotic animal. This is not \nsport--it is easy slaughter for a price. Sportsmen do not support this, \nand neither should we.\n  Mr. President, imagine this: A black leopard, raised in captivity, is \nreleased from a crate in the presence of a paying hunter and is \nimmediately surrounded by a pack of hounds. The cat, virtually \ndefenseless because it has been declared and is greatly outnumbered by \nthe hounds, tries to escape by running under a truck. The hounds follow \nthe leopard who then darts from under the truck slightly ahead of the \npack. The customer gets his shot--and his trophy.\n  Mr. President, in the United States today, there are estimated to be \nmore than 1,000 private hunting ranches where exotic mammals are shot \nfor a fee. Many of these hunting ranches have a land area of 1,000 \nacres or less--some are less than 100 acres. The animals are tame \ntargets for hunters and the proprietors of these operations \n\n[[Page S19111]]\noffer a guaranteed kill opportunity for their clients. It is called no \nkill, no pay. The animals are shot at point blank range--with bow or \nfirearm--and have no chance of eluding a hunter.\n  These hunting operations provide a laundry list of potential trophies \nfor hunters. For a fee, a hunter can kill whatever animal he or she \nwishes. Gazelles typically sell for $800 to $3,500; Cape buffaloes, \n$5,000; angora goats, $325; Corsican sheep, $500; red deer, $1,500 to \n$6,000. The rarer the animal--lions and tigers, for instance, the \nhigher the price.\n\n  I want to emphasize, Mr. President, that most sportsmen decry these \ndespicable practices as unsporting. They say that canned hunts make a \nmockery of hunting. The Boone and Crockett Club, a hunting organization \nfounded by former President Teddy Roosevelt that maintains records of \nNorth America's big game, takes the position that ``hunting game \nconfined in artificial barriers, including escape-proof fenced \nenclosures or hunting game transplanted solely for the purpose of \ncommercial shooting'' is ``unfair chase and unsportsmanlike.'' In 1994, \nin the publication Outdoor America, the magazine of the pro-hunting \nIzaak Walton League, Maitland Sharpe, the organization's executive \ndirector at the time, stated that this practice ``tarnishes all \nhunting, all hunting. . . .''\n  The American Zoo and Aquarium Association [AZA] forbids its \nmembership organizations from selling, trading, or transfering zoo \nanimals to hunting ranches, though the prohibition too often is \nignored. The AZA opposes canned hunts, and has written to Members of \nCongress that it ``(a) deplores and is opposed to canned hunts of \nexotic animals and (b) supports the prohibition of interstate practices \nwhich allow exotic animals to be killed in such hunts.''\n  Mr. President, exotic hunting ranches threaten native wildlife \npopulations with the spread of disease. If these ranch animals escape, \nthey can transmit diseases to native wildlife. John Talbott, acting \ndirector of the Wyoming Department of Fish and Game, stated in January \nof this year, ``Tuberculosis and other diseases documented among game \nranch animals in surrounding states'' pose ``an extremely serious \nthreat to Wyoming's native big game.'' This is one reason why Wyoming \nbans canned hunts. Other States also ban these hunts, including \nCalifornia, Connecticut, New Jersey, North Carolina, and Wisconsin. \nHowever, States that permit these operations import exotic mammals from \nother States--including those that prohibit canned hunts--and victimize \nthese animals in unsporting canned hunts. Federal legislation is needed \nto ban the interstate trade in exotic mammals for the purpose of \nshooting them for a fee to collect a trophy.\n  Federal legislation is also needed because exotic mammals are not \ncarefully regulated by the States. Exotic mammals often fall outside \nthe traditional range of responsibility for State fish and game \nagencies. They fall outside the purview of State agriculture \ndepartments. Exotic mammals--not being native wildlife or livestock--\nare in a sense, caught in regulatory limbo. This lack of oversight by \nState agencies allows canned hunt operators to exploit these animals \nfor profit.\n  My legislation is identical to a similar bill that has been \nintroduced in the House, H.R. 1202. The bill would ban only those \noperations of 1,000 acres or less in which tame animals are shot for a \nfee for the purposes of collecting a trophy. Larger hunting ranches, \nwhere the animals are provided with some room to maneuver, are exempt. \nThe hunting of native wildlife would not be affected in any way. The \nHouse bill has attracted strong bipartisan support, with over 100 \ncosponsors to date.\n  Mr. President, this legislation is needed to put a stop to this \namoral, cruel business. I urge my colleagues to support me in this \neffort, and ask unanimous consent that a copy of the bill be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1493\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Captive Exotic Animal \n     Protection Act of 1995''.\n\n     SEC. 2. TRANSPORTATION OR POSSESSION OF EXOTIC ANIMALS FOR \n                   PURPOSES OF KILLING OR INJURING THEM.\n\n       (A) In General.--Chapter 3 of title 18, United States Code, \n     is amended by adding at the end the following:\n\n     ``Sec. 48.

A bill to provide an extension for fiscal year 1996 for \ncertain programs administered by the Secretary of Housing and Urban \nDevelopment and the Secretary of Agriculture, and for other purposes; \nto the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs.\n\n\n         the housing opportunity program extension act of 1995\n\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, I rise to introduce the Housing \nOpportunity Program Extension Act of 1995. I wish to thank Senators \nMack, Bond, Shelby, Bennett, and Domenici for their cosponsorship of \nthis much needed legislation.\n  This important measure would provide short-term extensions of housing \nprograms which have expired. This bill does not create new housing \npolicy, but is a stopgap measure which would allow existing programs to \ncontinue until October 1, 1996. Next year, the Banking Committee and \nits Housing Subcommittees will continue its evaluation of proposals for \nreorganization and elimination of the Department of Housing and Urban \nDevelopment. Omnibus housing legislation will be introduced in the \nSpring of 1996 which will reorganize, transfer or eliminate housing and \ncommunity development programs. Some of the programs extended in this \nlegislation will be reformed at that time. Modifications of these \nprograms will be reserved until the Banking Committee has the \nopportunity for hearings and debate next year.\n  The majority of the housing program extensions contained in this bill \nwere passed by the Senate and House in the fiscal year 1996 Departments \nof Veterans Affairs and Housing and Urban Development, and Independent \nAgencies appropriations bill (H.R. 2099). If it were not for the recent \nveto of H.R. 2099, this legislation would not be necessary. However, \nthe President's veto has placed our Nation's housing delivery system in \nserious jeopardy. It is imperative that we act to extend housing \nprograms which would otherwise be suspended for an indefinite time \nperiod.\n  This legislation would extend the following: Section 8 contract \nrenewals; the Community Development Block Grant homeownership program; \nthe Section 515 rural multifamily loan program; the Home Equity \nConversion Mortgage program; and the Multifamily Housing Risk-Sharing \nprograms.\n  I look forward to working with all Members of the Senate on a \nbipartisan basis to ensure the swift passage of this much needed \nlegislation. I urge my colleagues to protect the needy recipients of \nthese effective housing programs by supporting the Housing Opportunity \nProgram Extension Act of 1995. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent \nthat the text of the bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n[[Page S19112]]\n\n\n                                S. 1494\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE; DEFINITION.\n\n       (a) Short Title.--This Act may be cited as the ``Housing \n     Opportunity Program Extension Act of 1995''.\n       (b) Definition.--For purposes of this Act, the term \n     ``Secretary'' means the Secretary of Housing and Urban \n     Development.\n\n     SEC. 2.

APPLICABILITY.\n\n       This Act and the amendments made by this Act shall be \n     construed to have become effective on October 1, 1995.\n\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I am introducing with Senators D'Amato and \nMack the Housing Opportunity Program Extenders Act of 1995. This \nlegislation is designed to provide HUD and the Rural Housing and \nCommunity Development Service--commonly known as FmHA--with authority \nto continue certain housing programs which are strongly supported by \nthe American public and which will generally be suspended if the \nadministration continues to ignore responsible dialogue on housing \nissues and vetoes S. 2099, the VA/HUD fiscal year 1996 appropriations \nbill.\n  I emphasize the importance of this bill and urge my colleagues to \nsupport this legislation. Most importantly, similar to the VA/HUD \nfiscal year 1996 appropriations bill, this bill would require HUD to \nrenew expiring section 8 project-based contracts for fiscal year 1996 \nfor 1 year at current rents. There are some 900,000 FHA-insured units \nwith section 8 project-based assistance contracts that are expiring \nover the next 10 years. Many of these section 8 contracts are currently \nsubsidized at above market rents and fiscal responsibility requires \nthat Congress contain the spiraling costs associated with this \ninventory. Moreover, under a recent HUD legal opinion, HUD may renew \nthese expiring section 8 project-based contracts at no more than 120 \npercent of fair market rents; this means that these section 8 projects \ncould begin to default and face foreclosure by HUD during fiscal year \n1996.\n  I believe it is critical that Congress reform and adjust the costs, \nincluding section 8 costs, of these assisted housing programs. However, \nin doing so, we must balance the cost of the expiring section 8 \ncontracts with the cost of foreclosure of these projects to the HUD \ninsurance fund, as well as the significant social policy of the \npossible displacement of low-income housing residents and the \ndisinvestment by project owners in these projects which could result in \nsignificant deterioration of this housing stock. Like the VA/HUD fiscal \nyear 1996 appropriations bill, renewing these section 8 contracts for 1 \nyear will provide the Banking Committee with an opportunity to address \nthese concerns through comprehensive legislation that will preserve \nthis valuable housing resource as low-income housing at a reasonable \ncost to the Federal Government.\n  Second, the legislation would extend the Home Equity Conversion \nMortgage Program through fiscal year 1996, increasing the maximum \nnumber of units eligible for insurance from 25,000 to 30,000. This \nprogram is designed to allow the elderly to tap the accumulated equity \nin their homes for needed expenses without the risk of losing the \nhousing as a principal residence. This is a successful program that is \ngrowing in popularity among the elderly population as an option to \nassist in providing continuing independence, both financially and \nthrough the continuing use of their homes as a principal resident.\n  Third, the legislation would extend the homeownership program under \nthe CDBG program as a continuing eligible activity through fiscal year \n1996. This program is widely supported by a number of communities \nthroughout the Nation which use the program as an additional resource \nto expand homeownership opportunities.\n  Fourth, the bill would extend the FHA multifamily risk-sharing \nprograms for fiscal year 1996. These programs authorize HUD to enter \ninto mortgage insurance agreements and partnerships with Fannie Mae and \nFreddie Mac and with State housing finance agencies for the creation of \naffordable multifamily housing. These are important programs which help \nto guarantee the availability of affordable rental housing in the \nNation.\n  Finally, the bill would extend the Rural Housing and Community \nDevelopment Service's section 515 rural multifamily housing program for \nfiscal year 1996. Currently, fiscal year 1996 appropriations generally \nhave limited the available funding for fiscal year 1996 to \nrehabilitation. However, there is a significant need for additional \nrural housing which is affordable. Moreover, section 515 projects are, \nin many cases, the only available and affordable low-income housing in \nrural areas. While there has been substantial criticism leveled at \nabuses in the section 515 program, the Rural Housing and Community \nDevelopment Service has addressed a number of the failings in the \nprogram and the Banking Committee has pledged to review closely the \nsection 515 program and address any concerns as part of a major housing \nand community development overhaul and reform bill.\n  Mr. President, this legislation is bipartisan, simple, \nstraightforward and necessary. I strongly urge my colleagues to support \nthis legislation.\n  Mr. MACK. Mr. President, I am pleased to join with Senator D'Amato as \na cosponsor of this bill to extend for 1 year a number of housing \nactivities under the jurisdiction of the Banking Committee. The fiscal \nyear 1996 VA-HUD-Independent agencies appropriation bill extended the \nauthority for a \n\n[[Page S19113]]\nnumber of expired HUD programs and activities for 1 year to give the \nauthorizing committee time to consider needed reforms in those programs \nand deal with them more permanently.\n  Unfortunately, the President vetoed the appropriation bill, and these \nprograms are in immediate jeopardy. This legislation is necessary to \ncontinue authorizations for activities that have broad support. I \nstress to my colleagues that this is emergency legislation that \ncontains no programmatic reforms.\n  First, and foremost, this bill would allow HUD to renew expiring \nsection 8 rental assistance contracts at current rents for 1 year. HUD \nhas taken the position that it currently has no authority for fiscal \nyear 1996 to renew expiring section 8 contracts at above fair market \nrent [FMR]. Without language to allow contract renewals at above FMR, a \nlarge number of FHA-insured multifamily housing projects could face \ndefault this year. This extension will give the authorizing committee \ntime to develop an orderly ``mark-to-market'' strategy to restructure \nthe debt on these projects, end payments of excessive rental subsidies, \nand help bring HUD's budget under control.\n  This bill also extends the Federal Housing Administration's mortgage \ninsurance program Home Equity Conversion Mortgages. This popular \ndemonstration program has allowed more than 14,000 elderly homeowners \nto tap into the equity in their homes, but mortgage authority for the \nprogram expired at the end of fiscal 1995. This extension will give us \nthe time needed to pass legislation extending the program for another 5 \nyears and to enact reforms that will make the program more effective.\n  The legislation extends the FHA section 515 rural rental housing loan \nprogram. This is the only program extension included that is not under \nthe jurisdiction of the VA-HUD-Independent Agencies appropriations \nsubcommittee. However, this is an important housing development program \nunder the Banking Committee's jurisdiction, and there is currently a \nsignificant backlog of preapproved applications for section 515 loans.\n  I am, however, concerned by reports issued by the General Accounting \nOffice and others indicating that structural and financial management \nproblems exist in the section 515 program. As chairman of the Housing \nOpportunity and Community Development Subcommittee, I intend to hold \nhearings on this and other rural housing programs early next year and \nto propose program reforms where needed. No further extensions of the \nsection 515 program should be approved until the program has been \nthoroughly reviewed by the Banking Committee.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. KYL (for himself, Mr. Hatch, and Mr. DeWine):\n  S. 1495. A bill to control crime, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on the Judiciary.\n\n\n                    THE CRIME PREVENTION ACT OF 1995\n\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I rise to introduce the Crime Prevention Act. \nOne of the most important responsibilities for the 104th Congress is to \npass a tough comprehensive crime measure that will restore law and \norder to America's streets.\n  Reported crime may have decreased slightly over the past few years, \nbut the streets are still too dangerous. Too many Americans are afraid \nto go out for fear of being robbed, assaulted, or murdered.\n  In fact, according to the Bureau of Justice Statistics report \n``Highlights from 20 Years of Surveying Crime Victims,'' approximately \n2 million people are injured a year as a result of violent crime. Of \nthose who are injured, more than half require some level of medical \ntreatment and nearly a quarter receive treatment in a hospital \nemergency room or require hospitalization.\n\n\n                       THE CRIME CLOCK IS TICKING\n\n  The picture painted by crime statistics is frightening. According to \nthe Uniform Crime Reports released by the Department of Justice, in \n1994 there was: a violent crime every 17 seconds; a murder every 23 \nminutes; a forcible rape every 5 minutes; a robbery every 51 seconds; \nan aggravated assault every 28 seconds; a property crime every 3 \nseconds; a burglary every 12 seconds; and a motor vehicle theft every \n20 seconds.\n  In short, a crime index offense occurred every 2 seconds. And this is \njust reported crime.\n\n\n                               STATISTICS\n\n  Again, according to the Uniform Crime Reports in 1994, there were \n1,864,168 violent crimes reported to law enforcement, a rate of 716 \nviolent crimes per 100,000 inhabitants. The 1994 total was 2 percent \nabove the 1990 level and 40 percent above that of 1985.\n  Further, juvenile crime is skyrocketing. According to statistics \ncompiled by the FBI, from 1985 to 1993 the number of homicides \ncommitted by males aged 18 to 24 increased 65 percent, and by males \naged 14 to 17 increased 165 percent. In addition, according to \nstatistics recently released by the Department of Justice, during 1993, \nthe youngest age group surveyed--those 12 to 15 years old--had the \ngreatest risk of being the victims of violent crimes.\n  Crime in my State, Arizona, is very much on the rise. In 1994, \nPhoenix suffered a record 244 homicides. An article in the December \n12th Arizona Republic, stated that 235 people have been slain this \nyear, 9 short of last year's record. Statewide crime was up in Mesa, \nChandler, Glendale, Scottsdale, and Tempe. By August, the number of \nmurders in Tucson this year eclipsed last year's total.\n\n\n                        THE HEAVY COST OF CRIME\n\n  Aside from the vicious personal toll exacted, crime also has a \ndevastating effect on the economy of our country. Business Week \nestimated in 1993 that crime costs Americans $425 million annually. To \nfight crime, the United States spends about $90 billion a year on the \nentire criminal justice system. Crime is especially devastating to our \ncities, which often have crime rates several times higher than suburbs.\n  The Washington Post ran an October 8 article detailing the work of \nprofessors Mark Levitt and Mark Cohen in estimating the real cost of \ncrime to society. According to the article, ``[i]nstead of merely \ntoting up the haul in armed robberies or burglaries, Cohen tallied all \nof the costs associated with various kinds of crime, from loss of \nincome sustained by a murder victim's family to the cost of counseling \na rape victim to the diminished value of houses in high-burglary \nneighborhoods.'' These quality of life costs raise the cost of crime \nconsiderably. Cohen and Levitt calculated that one murder costs society \non average $2.7 million. A robbery nets the robber an average of $2,900 \nin actual cash, but it produces $14,900 in quality of life expenses. \nAnd while the actual monetary loss caused by an assault is $1,800, it \nproduces $10,200 in quality of life expenses.\n\n\n                              LEGISLATION\n\n  Fighting crime must be one of our top priorities. Few would dispute \nthis. In fact, according to an article in the July 19th Tucson Citizen, \nabout 500 business, education, and government leaders in Tucson ranked \ncrime as the No. 1 issue in a survey commissioned by the Greater Tucson \nEconomic Council.\n  The House has done its part. It has delivered on the Contract With \nAmerica by passing a series of strong crime bills in February.\n  The Senate has not acted with comparable vigor. Given the magnitude \nof the problem of crime in our society, I believe that it is important \nto consider a comprehensive crime package. My bill has solid reforms \nthat should blunt the forecasted explosion in crime.\n  I would like to take this opportunity to given an outline of the \nmajor provisions included in the Crime Prevention Act of 1995.\n\n\n                        prison litigation reform\n\n  Although numbers are not available for all of the States, 33 states \nhave estimated that inmate civil rights suits cost them at least $54.5 \nmillion annually. Thus, extrapolating this figure to all 50 states, the \nestimate cost for inmate civil rights suits is $81.3 million per year. \nNot all of these cases are frivolous, but according to the National \nAssociation of Attorneys General, more than 95 percent of inmate civil \nrights suits are dismissed without the inmate receiving anything.\n  Title I of this bill will deter frivolous inmate lawsuits by:\n  Removing the ability of prisoners to file free lawsuits, instead \nmaking them pay full filing fees and court costs.\n  Requiring judges to dismiss frivolous cases before they bog down the \ncourt system.\n  Prohibiting inmate lawsuits for mental and emotional distress.\n  \n[[Page S19114]]\n\n  Retracting good-time credit earned by inmates if they file lawsuits \ndeemed frivolous.\n  These provisions are based on similar provisions that were enacted in \nArizona. Arizona's recent reforms have already reduced state prisoner \ncases by 50 percent. Now is the time to reproduce these common sense \nreforms in Federal law. If we achieve a 50-percent reduction in bogus \nFederal prisoner claims, we will free up judicial resources for claims \nwith merit by both prisoners and nonprisoners.\n\n\n                            special masters\n\n  This bill requires the Federal judiciary to pay for special masters \nin prison litigation cases. Currently, Federal court judges can, and \ndo, force States to pay the costs for special masters. This is an \nunfunded judicial mandate. The special masters appointed in prison \nlitigation cases have cost Arizona taxpayers more than $370,000 since \n1992. Arizona taxpayers have paid special masters up to $175 an hour. \nIn one case, taxpayers funds were used to hire a chauffeur for a \nspecial master.\n\n\n                  victim rights and domestic violence\n\n  Women are the victims of more than 4.5 million violent crimes a year, \nincluding half a million rapes or other sexual assaults, according to \nthe Department of Justice. The National Victims Center calculates that \na woman is battered every 15 seconds.\n  Last year's crime bill, which is now law, did much to help victims of \ndomestic violence--making it easier for evidence of intrafamilial \nsexual abuse to be introduced, for example. It will now be much easier \nfor prosecutors in Federal cases to introduce evidence that the accused \ncommitted a similar crime in the past. The crime act also provides \nFederal funding for battered women's shelters and training for law-\nenforcement officers and prosecutors.\n\n  But more needs to be done. A message must be sent to abusers that \ntheir behavior is not a family matter. Society should treat domestic \nviolence as seriously as it does violence between strangers. My bill \nwill strengthen the rights of domestic violence victims in Federal \ncourt and, hopefully, set a standard for the individual States to \nemulate.\n  First, my bill authorizes the death penalty for cases in which a \nwoman is murdered by her husband or boyfriend.\n  My bill also provides that if a defendant presents negative character \nevidence concerning the victim, the Government's rebuttal can include \nnegative character evidence concerning the defendant.\n  We must establish a higher standard of professional conduct for \nlawyers. My legislation prohibits harassing or dilatory tactics, \nknowingly presenting false evidence or discrediting truthful evidence, \nwillful ignorance of matters that could be learned from the client, and \nconcealment of information necessary to prevent sexual abuse or other \nviolent crimes.\n  Violence in our society leaves law-abiding citizens feeling \ndefenseless. It is time to level the playing field. Federal law \ncurrently gives the defense more chances than the prosecution to reject \na potential juror. My bill protects the right of victims to an \nimpartial jury by giving both sides the same number of peremptory \nchallenges.\n\n\n                                firearms\n\n  Almost 30 percent of all violent crimes are committed through the use \nof a firearm, either to intimidate the victim into submission or to \ninjure the victim, according to the Bureau of Justice Statistics. And \n70 percent of all murders committed were accomplished through the use \nof a firearm. To help stop this violence the bill increases the \nmandatory minimum sentences for criminals who use firearms in the \ncommission of crimes. It imposes the following minimum penalties: 10 \nyears for using or carrying a firearm during the commission of a \nFederal crime of violence or drug trafficking crime; 20 years if the \nfirearm is discharged; incarceration for life or punishment by death if \ndeath of a person results.\n\n\n                         the exclusionary rule\n\n  To ensure that relevant evidence is not kept from juries, the bill \nextends the good faith exception to the exclusionary rule to nonwarrant \ncases, where the court determines that the circumstances justified an \nobjectively reasonable belief by officers that their conduct was \nlawful.\n\n\n                           the death penalty\n\n  The vast majority of the American public supports the option of the \ndeath penalty. An ABC News/Washington Post poll conducted in January \n1995 found that 74 percent of Americans favor the death penalty for \npersons convicted of murder. Similarly, a Market Opinion Research poll \nconducted in December 1994 found that nearly three-quarters of \nAmericans support capital punishment.\n  To deter crime and to make a clear statement that the most vicious, \nevil behavior will not be tolerated in our society, the bill \nstrengthens the death penalty standards.\n  Additionally, the bill adds murder of a witness as an aggravating \nfactor that permits a jury to consider the death penalty; provides \neffective safeguards against delay in the execution of Federal capital \nsentences resulting from protracted collateral litigation, including \ntime limits on filing and strict limitations on successive motions; and \nprovides for capital punishment for murders committed in the District \nof Columbia.\n\n\n                             habeas corpus\n\n  To eliminate the abuse, delay, and repetitive litigation in the lower \nFederal courts, title VIII of this bill provides that the decision of \nState courts will not be subject to review in the lower Federal courts, \nso long as they are adequate and effective remedies in the State courts \nfor testing the legality of a person's detention. This provision limits \nthe needless duplicative review in the lower Federal courts, and helps \nput a stop to the endless appeals of convicted criminals. Judge Robert \nBork has written a letter in support of this provision.\n\n\n                             Computer Crime\n\n  I am pleased to include, in this bill, my National Information \nInfrastructure Protection Act which will strengthen current public law \non computer crime and protect the national information infrastructure. \nMy fear is that our national infrastructure--the information that bonds \nall Americans--is not adequately protected. I offer this legislation as \na protection to one of America's greatest commodities--information.\n  Although there has never been an accurate nationwide reporting system \nfor computer crime, specific reports suggest that computer crime is \nrising. For example, the Computer Emergency and Response Team [CERT] at \nCarnegie-Mellon University reports that computer intrusions have \nincreased from 132 in 1989 to 2,341 last year. A June 14 Wall Street \nJournal article stated that a Rand Corp. study reported 1,172 hacking \nincidents occurred during the first 6 months of last year. A report \ncommissioned last year by the Department of Defense and the CIA stated \nthat ``[a]ttacks against information systems are becoming more \naggressive, not only seeking access to confidential information, but \nalso stealing and degrading service and destroying data.'' Clearly \nthere is a need to reform the current criminal statutes covering \ncomputers.\n\n\n                        Administrative Subpoena\n\n  This bill allows high-ranking Secret Service agents to issue an \nadministrative subpoena for information in cases in which a person's \nlife is in danger. The Department of Agriculture, the Resolution Trust \nCorporation, and the Food and Drug Administration already have \nadministrative subpoena power. The Secret Service should have it to \nprotect the lives of American citizens.\n\n\n                           Internet Gambling\n\n  There is a new underworld of gambling evolving. Gambling on the \nInternet is on the rise. Many ``virtual'' casinos have emerged on this \nvast network that accept real money at the click of a mouse or the \npunch of a key. It is estimated that Internet gambling could, before \ntoo long, become a $50 billion business. That is why I have included a \nsection which will make it illegal, if it is illegal to gamble in your \nState, to gamble on the Internet. Current statutes make it illegal only \nif you are in the business of gambling on the Internet. I have also \nincluded a provision that would require the Department of Justice to \nanalyze all problems associated with enforcing the current gambling \nstatute.\n\n\n                               conclusion\n\n  The Kyl crime bill is an important effort in the fight against crime. \nWe can win this fight, if we have the conviction, and keep the pressure \non Congress to pass tough crime-control measures. It is time to stop \nkowtowing to prisoners, apologists for criminals, and the \n\n[[Page S19115]]\ndefense lawyers, and pass a strong crime bill.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that additional material be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                    The Crime Prevention Act of 1995\n\n\n                   title i--prison litigation reform\n\n Section 101: Amendments to Civil Rights of Institutionalized Persons \n                                  Act\n\n       Amends the Civil Rights of Institutionalized Persons Act to \n     require that administrative remedies be exhausted prior to \n     any prison conditions action being brought under any federal \n     law by an inmate in federal court.\n\n               Section 102: Proceedings in forma pauperis\n\n       Provides that whenever a federal, state, or local prisoner \n     seeks to commence an action or proceeding in federal court as \n     an indigent, the prisoner will be liable for the full amount \n     of a filing fee, and will initially be assessed a partial \n     filing fee of 20 percent of the larger of the average monthly \n     balance in, or the average monthly deposits to, his inmate \n     account. The fee may not exceed the full statutory fee, and \n     an inmate will not be barred from suing if he is actually \n     unable to pay. This section also imposes the same payment \n     system for court costs as it does for filing fees. This \n     provision, like the filing fee provision, will ensure that \n     inmates evaluate the merits of their claims.\n\n                    Section 103: Judicial screening\n\n       Requires judicial screening of a complaint in a civil \n     action in which a prisoner seeks redress from a governmental \n     entity or officer or employee of a governmental entity. The \n     court must dismiss a complaint if the complaint fails to \n     state a claim on which relief may be granted. Also, the court \n     must dismiss claims for monetary relief from a defendant who \n     is immune from such relief.\n\n        Section 104: Federal tort claims and civil rights claims\n\n       Prohibits lawsuits by inmates for mental or emotional \n     injury suffered while in custody unless the inmates can show \n     physical injury.\n\n    Section 105: Payment of damage award in satisfaction of pending \n                           restitution orders\n\n       Provides that restitution payments must be taken from any \n     award won by a prisoner.\n\n      Section 106: Notice to crime victims of pending damage award\n\n       Mandates that restitution payments must be taken from any \n     award won by the prisoner and requires victims to be notified \n     whenever a prisoner receives a monetary award from the state.\n\n         Section 107: Earned release credit or good time credit\n\n       Deters frivolous inmate lawsuits by revoking good-time \n     credits when a frivolous suit is filed. Specifically, in a \n     civil action brought by an adult convicted of a crime and \n     confined in a federal correctional facility, the court may \n     order the revocation of earned good-time credit if the court \n     finds that (1) the claim was filed for a malicious purpose, \n     (2) the claim was filed solely to harass the party against \n     which it was filed, or (3) the claimant testifies falsely or \n     otherwise knowingly presents false evidence or information to \n     the court.\n\n\n                           title ii--prisons\n\n                      Section 201: Special masters\n\n       Requires the federal judiciary to pay for special masters \n     in prison litigation cases. Each party shall submit a list of \n     five recommended special masters and can strike three names \n     from the opposing party's list. The court shall select the \n     master from the remaining names. Each party shall have the \n     right to an interlocutory appeal, on the grounds that the \n     master is not impartial or will not give due deference to the \n     public safety. The court shall review the appointment of the \n     special master every six months to determine whether the \n     services of the special master are still required. Imposes \n     new requirements on special masters. The special master must \n     make findings on the record as a whole, is prohibited from \n     making findings or communications ex parte, and shall be \n     terminated upon the termination of relief.\n\n\n                title iii--equal protection for victims\n\n           Section 301: Right of the victim to impartial jury\n\n       Protects the right of victims to an impartial jury by \n     equalizing the number of peremptory challenges afforded to \n     the defense and the prosecution in jury selection.\n\n       Section 302: Rebuttal of attacks on the victim's character\n\n       Provides that if a defendant presents negative character \n     evidence concerning the victim, the government's rebuttal can \n     include negative character evidence concerning the defendant.\n\n        Section 303: Victim's right of allocution in sentencing\n\n       Extends the right of victims to address the court \n     concerning the sentence to all criminal cases. Current law \n     provides such a right for victims only in violent crime and \n     sexual abuse cases, though the offender has the right to make \n     an allocutive statement in all cases.\n\n     SECTION 304: RIGHT OF THE VICTIM TO FAIR TREATMENT IN LEGAL \n                   PROCEEDINGS\n\n       Establishes higher standards of professional conduct for \n     lawyers in federal cases to protect victims and other \n     witnesses from abuse, and to promote the effective search for \n     truth. Specific measures include prohibition of harassing or \n     dilatory tactics, knowingly presenting false evidence or \n     discrediting truthful evidence, willful ignorance of matters \n     that could be learned from the client, and concealment of \n     information necessary to prevent violent or sexual abuse \n     crimes.\n\n     SECTION 305: USE OF NOTICE CONCERNING RELEASE OF THE OFFENDER\n\n       Repeals the provision that notices to state and local law \n     enforcement concerning the release of federal violent and \n     drug trafficking offenders can only be used for law \n     enforcement purposes. This removes an impediment to other \n     legitimate uses of such information, such as advising victims \n     or potential victims that the offender has returned to the \n     area.\n\n     SECTION 306: BALANCE IN THE COMPOSITION OF RULES COMMITTEES\n\n       Provides for equal representation of prosecutors with \n     defense lawyers on committees in the judiciary that make \n     recommendations concerning the rules affecting criminal \n     cases.\n\n\n                      title iv--domestic violence\n\n     SECTION 401: DEATH PENALTY FOR FATAL DOMESTIC VIOLENCE \n                   OFFENSES\n\n       Authorizes capital punishment, under the federal interstate \n     domestic violence offenses, for cases in which the offender \n     murders the victim.\n\n     SECTION 402: EVIDENCE OF DEFENDANT'S DISPOSITION TOWARD \n                   VICTIM IN DOMESTIC VIOLENCE\n\n       Clarifies that evidence of a defendant's disposition toward \n     a particular individual--such as the violent disposition of a \n     domestic violence defendant toward the victim--is not subject \n     to exclusion as impermissible evidence of character.\n\n     SECTION 403: BATTERED WOMEN'S SYNDROME EVIDENCE\n\n       Clarifies that battered women's syndrome evidence is \n     admissible, under the federal expert testimony rule, to help \n     courts and juries understand the behavior of victims in \n     domestic violence cases and other cases.\n\n     SECTION 404: HIV TESTING OF DEFENDANTS IN SEXUAL ASSAULT \n                   CASES\n\n       Provides effective procedures for HIV testing of defendants \n     in sexual assault cases, with disclosure of test results to \n     the victim.\n\n\n                           title v--firearms\n\n     SECTION 501: MANDATORY MINIMUM SENTENCES FOR CRIMINALS USING \n                   FIREARMS\n\n       Imposes the following minimum penalties: 10 years for using \n     or carrying a firearm during the commission of a federal \n     crime of violence or drug trafficking crime; 20 years if the \n     firearm is discharged; incarceration for life or punishment \n     by death if death of a person results.\n\n     SECTION 502: FIREARMS POSSESSION BY VIOLENT FELONS AND \n                   SERIOUS DRUG OFFENDERS\n\n       Provides mandatory penalties (5 years and 10 years \n     respectively) for firearms possession by persons with one or \n     two convictions for violent felonies or serious drug crimes.\n\n     SECTION 503: USE OF FIREARMS IN CONNECTION WITH \n                   COUNTERFEITING OR FORGERY\n\n       Adds counterfeiting and forgery to offenses making \n     applicable mandatory penalties under 18 U.S.C. 924(c) when \n     firearms are used to facilitate their commission.\n\n     SECTION 504: POSSESSION OF AN EXPLOSIVE DURING THE COMMISSION \n                   OF A FELONY\n\n       Strengthens mandatory penalty provision for cases of \n     felonies involving explosives.\n\n     SECTION 505: SECOND OFFENSE OF USING AN EXPLOSIVE TO COMMIT A \n                   FELONY\n\n       Increases to 20 years the mandatory penalty for a second \n     conviction for using or possessing an explosive during the \n     commission of a felony.\n\n\n                      TITLE VI--EXCLUSIONARY RULE\n\n             Section 601: Admissibility of certain evidence\n\n       Extends the ``good faith'' exception to the exclusionary \n     rule to non-warrant cases, where the court determines that \n     the circumstances justified an objectively reasonable belief \n     by officers that their conduct was lawful.\n\n\n                   TITLE VII--FEDERAL DEALTH PENALTY\n\n   Section 701: Strengthening of Federal death penalty standards and \n                               procedures\n\n       Strengthens federal death penalty standards and procedures. \n     Requires defendant to give notice of mitigating factors that \n     will be relied on in capital sentencing hearing (just as the \n     government is now required to give notice of aggravating \n     factors), adds use of a firearm in committing a killing as an \n     aggravating factor that permits a jury to consider the death \n     penalty, directs the jury to impose a capital sentence if \n     aggravating factors outweight mitigating factors, and \n     authorizes uniform federal procedures for carrying out \n     federal capital sentences.\n\n          Section 702: Murder of witness as aggravating factor\n\n       Adds murder of a witness as an aggravating factor that \n     permits a jury to consider the death penalty.\n\n   Section 703: Safeguards against delay in the execution of capital \n                       sentences in Federal cases\n\n       Provides effective safeguards against delay in the \n     execution of federal capital sentences resulting from \n     protracted collateral litigation, including time limits on \n     filing and strict limitations on successive motions\n\n     Section 704: Death penalty for murders committed with firearms\n\n       Creates federal jurisdiction and authorizes capital \n     punishment for murders committed \n\n[[Page S19116]]\n     with a firearm where the firearm has crossed state lines.\n\n  Section 705: Death penalty for murders committed in the District of \n                                Columbia\n\n       Provides for capital punishment for murders committed in \n     the District of Columbia.\n\n\n                       TITLE VIII--HABEAS CORPUS\n\n       Section 801: Stopping abuse of Federal collateral remedies\n\n       Provides that an application for a writ of habeas corpus in \n     behalf of a person in custody pursuant to a judgment or order \n     of a state court shall not be entertained by a judge or a \n     court of the United States unless the remedies in the courts \n     of the state are inadequate or ineffective to test the \n     legality of the person's detention.\n\n\n                         TITLE IX--IMMIGRATION\n\n  Section 901: Additional expansion of definition of aggravated felony\n\n       Aliens who commit aggravated felonies can be deported from \n     the country. The section adds to that definition crimes \n     involving the transportation of persons for the purposes of \n     prostitution; serious bribery, counterfeiting, or forgery \n     offenses; serious offenses involving trafficking in stolen \n     vehicles; offenses involving trafficking in counterfeit \n     immigration documents; obstruction of justice, perjury, and \n     bribery of a witness; and an offense relating to the failure \n     to appear to answer for a criminal offense for which a \n     sentence of two or more years my be imposed.\n\nSection 902: Deportation procedures for certain criminal aliens who are \n                        not permanent residents\n\n       Modifies the INA to make it clear that the existing \n     expedited deportation procedures which apply to non-resident \n     criminal aliens apply also to aliens admitted for permanent \n     residence on a conditional basis. The section also prohibits \n     the Attorney General from using discretionary power under the \n     INA to grant relief from deportation to any non-resident \n     alien who has been convicted of committing an aggravated \n     felony.\n\nSection 903: Restricting the defense to exclusion based on seven years \n            permanent residence for certain criminal aliens\n\n       Modifies that portion of the INA which determines who may \n     be denied entrance to the United States and who may be \n     deported from the country. Under present law, legal permanent \n     residents who have lived in the country for seven years may \n     leave temporarily and return but not be subject to many of \n     the INA provisions that determine who may legally enter the \n     United States. However, if these persons have been convicted \n     of an aggravated felony and served five years in prison, \n     the government may exclude them from the country \n     notwithstanding their seven years of residence. The change \n     made by this section strengthens this exception to allow \n     the government to exclude these persons if they were \n     sentenced to five or more years in prison for one or more \n     aggravated felonies. The change is being made so that the \n     government may begin deportation proceedings when the \n     criminal alien is incarcerated rather than having to wait \n     for five years to pass.\n\nSection 904: Limitation on collateral attacks on underlying deportation \n                                 order\n\n       This section applies to cases where an alien is charged \n     with attempting to re-enter the United States after having \n     been deported. The penalties for illegally re-entering the \n     United States after having been deported were enhanced by the \n     1994 Crime Act. This section makes it clear that an alien \n     charged with illegally re-entering may only challenge the \n     validity of the original deportation order when the alien can \n     show that he or she has exhausted all administrative \n     remedies, that the deportation order improperly deprived the \n     alien of the opportunity for judicial review, and that the \n     deportation order was fundamentally unfair.\n\n           Section 905: Criminal alien identification system\n\n       Modifies that part of the 1994 Crime Act which created a \n     ``Criminal Alien Tracking Center.'' The 1994 act failed to \n     state the purpose of the center. This section specifies that \n     the center is to be used to assist federal, state, and local \n     law enforcement agencies in identifying and locating aliens \n     who may be deportable because they have committed aggravated \n     felonies. The bill also changes the name of the center to \n     ``Criminal Alien Identification System'' in order to more \n     accurately reflect its function.\n\n   Section 906: Wiretap authority for alien smuggling investigations\n\n       Adds certain immigration-related offenses to the list of \n     crimes to which the Racketeer Influenced Corrupt \n     Organizations (``RICO'') law applies. The RICO statute is \n     among the principal tools that federal law enforcement \n     officials use to combat organized crime. The amendment made \n     by this section expands the definition of ``predicate acts'' \n     to enable them to use that statute to combat alien smuggling \n     organizations. The bill also gives federal law enforcement \n     officials the authority to utilize wiretaps to investigate \n     certain immigration-related crimes.\n\nSection 907: Expansion of criteria for deportation for crimes of moral \n                               turpitude\n\n       This section amends the INA to deport aliens who have been \n     in the country for less than five years (and legal permanent \n     resident aliens who have resided in the country for less than \n     ten years) and who are convicted of a felony crime involving \n     moral turpitude. Under current law, persons convicted of \n     crimes of moral turpitude can only be deported if they have \n     been sentenced to, or serve, at least one year in prison.\n\n       Section 908: Study of prisoner transfer treaty with Mexico\n\n       Requires the Secretary of State and the Attorney General to \n     submit a study to the Congress concerning the uses and \n     effectiveness of the prisoner transfer treaty with Mexico. \n     That treaty provides for the deportation of aliens who have \n     been convicted of a crime while they are in the United \n     States.\n\n   Section 909: Justice Department assistance in bringing to justice \n      aliens who flee prosecution for crimes in the United States\n\n       Requires the Attorney General, in cooperation with the INS \n     Commissioner and the Secretary of State, to establish an \n     office within the Justice Department to provide technical and \n     prosecutorial assistance to states and political subdivisions \n     in connection with their efforts to obtain extradition of \n     aliens who commit crimes in the United States and then flee \n     the country. This section also requires a report within one \n     year assessing the nature and extent of the problem of \n     bringing to justice aliens who flee prosecution in the United \n     States.\n\n                 Section 910: Prison transfer treaties\n\n       Advises the President that Congress desires him to \n     negotiate prison transfer treaties with other countries \n     within 90 days of the bill's enactment\n\n               Section 911: Interior repatriation program\n\n       Requires the Attorney General and the INS Commissioner to \n     develop programs under which aliens who illegally enter the \n     United States from Mexico or Canada on three or more \n     occasions would be deported at least 500 kilometers within \n     the country. The intent of this section is to make it more \n     difficult for aliens who have a history of illegal entry to \n     re-enter the country after they have been deported. The \n     program is to be implemented within 180 days of enactment of \n     the bill.\n\nSection 912: Deportation of nonviolent offenders prior to completion of \n                        sentence of imprisonment\n\n       Gives the Attorney General the discretion to deport certain \n     aliens held in federal prison before they complete their \n     sentences. Only those criminal aliens who have committed a \n     non-violent aggravated felony may be deported, and the \n     Attorney General must first determine that early deportation \n     is in the best interest of the United States. The Attorney \n     General may also deport non-violent criminal aliens held in \n     state prisons if the governor of the state submits a \n     written request to the Attorney General that aliens be \n     deported before they have served their sentence. In both \n     cases, should an alien illegally re-enter the United \n     States, the Attorney General is required to incarcerate \n     the alien for the remainder of the prison term.\n\n\n                  title x--gangs, juveniles, and drugs\n\n              Section 1001: Criminal street gang offenses\n\n       Contains provisions, passed by the Senate in the 103rd \n     Congress Senate crime bill, which create new offenses and \n     authorize severe penalties for criminal street gangs \n     activities.\n\n Section 1002: Serious juvenile drug offenses as Armed Career Criminal \n                             Act predicates\n\n       Contains a provision, passed by the Senate in the 103rd \n     Congress Senate crime bill, which adds serious juvenile drug \n     offenses as predicate offenses for purposes of the Armed \n     Career Criminal Act.\n\n     Section 1003: Adult prosecution of serious juvenile offenders\n\n       Permits adult prosecution down to the age of 13 of \n     junvenile offenders who commit serious violent felonies, and \n     creates a presumption in favor of adult prosecution for such \n     juvenile offenders who are 15 or older.\n\n   Section 1004: Increased penalties for recidivists committing drug \n                        crimes involving minors\n\n       Increases to three years the mandatory minimum penalties \n     for a second offense of distributing drugs to a minor or \n     using a minor in trafficking.\n\n  Section 1005: Amendments concerning records of crimes committed by \n                               juveniles\n\n       Incorporates the amendments of section 618 of the 103rd \n     Congress Senate-passed crime bill which broaden the retention \n     and availability of records for federally prosecuted juvenile \n     offenders.\n\n                    Section 1006: Drive-by shootings\n\n       Incorporates the broad drive-by shooting offense that was \n     passed by the House of Representatives in section 2335 of \n     H.R. 3371 of the 102nd Congress.\n\n                     Section 1007: Steroids offense\n\n       Incorporates the offense, passed by the Senate in section \n     1504 of the 103rd Congress Senate crime bill, which prohibits \n     coaches and trainers from attempting to get others to use \n     steroids.\n\n            Section 1008: Drug testing of Federal offenders\n\n       Adds hair analysis to the permissible forms of drug \n     testing.\n\n\n                      title xi--public corruption\n\n    Section 1101: Strengthening of Federal anti-corruption statutes \n                               generally\n\n       Strengthens federal public corruption laws. Specific \n     improvements include more adequate coverage of election \n     fraud, more uniform jurisdiction over corruption offenses, \n     increased penalties for such offenses, and protection for \n     whistle blowers.\n\n                   Section 1102: Interstate commerce\n\n       Extends wire fraud statute, which is often used to \n     prosecute public corruption offenses, \n\n[[Page S19117]]\n     including strengthening of jurisdictional provision.\n\n           Section 1103: Narcotics-related public corruption\n\n       Adopts special provisions for drug-related public \n     corruption, including severe penalties.\n\n\n                   title xii--administrative subponea\n\nSection 1201: Administrative summons authority of United States Secret \n                                Service\n\n       Allows high-ranking Secret Service agents to issue an \n     administrative subponea for information in cases in which the \n     President or other federal protectees are in danger. The \n     Department of Agriculture, the Resolution Trust Corporation, \n     and the Food and Drug Administration already have \n     administrative subponea power.\n\n\n                      title xiii--computer crimes\n\n     Section 1301: Protection of classified government information\n\n       Penalizes individuals who deliberately break into a \n     computer, or attempt to do so, without authority and, \n     thereby, obtain and disseminate classified information.\n\n Section 1302: Protection of financial, government, and other computer \n                              information\n\n       Makes interstate or foreign theft of information by \n     computer a crime. This provision is necessary in light of \n     United States v. Brown, 925 F.2d 1301, 1308 (10th Cir. 1991), \n     where the court held that purely intangible intellectual \n     property, such as computer programs, cannot constitute goods, \n     wares, merchandise, securities, or monies which have been \n     stolen, converted, or taken within the meaning of 18 U.S.C. \n     Sec. 2314.\n\n        Section 1303: Protection of government computer systems\n\n       Makes two changes to Sec. 1030(a)(3), which currently \n     prohibits intentionally accessing, without authorization, \n     computers used by, or for, any department or agency of the \n     United States and thereby ``adversely'' affecting ``the use \n     of the Government's operation of such computer.'' First, it \n     deletes the word ``adversely'' since this term suggest, \n     inappropriately, that trespassing in a government computer \n     may be benign. Second, the bill replaces the phrase ``the use \n     of the Government's operation of such computer'' with the \n     term ``that use.'' When a computer is used for the \n     government, the government is not necessarily the operator, \n     and the old phrase may lead to confusion. The bill makes a \n     similar change to the definition of ``protected computer'' in \n     Sec. 1030(e)(2)(A).\n\nSection 1304: Increased penalties for significant unauthorized use of a \n                            computer system\n\n       Amends 18 U.S.C. Sec. 1030(a)(4) to insure that felony \n     level sanctions apply when unauthorized use or use in excess \n     of authorization is significant.\n\n        Section 1305: Protection from damage to computer systems\n\n       Amends 18 U.S.C. Sec. 1030(a)(5) to further protect \n     computer systems covered by the statute from damage by anyone \n     who intentionally damages a computer, regardless of whether \n     they were authorized to access the computer.\n\nSection 1306: Protection from threats directed against computer systems\n\n       Adds a new section to 18 U.S.C. Sec. 1030(a) to provide \n     penalties for the interstate transmission of threats directed \n     against computers and computer networks. The new section \n     covers any interstate or international transmission of \n     threats against computers, computer networks, and their data \n     and programs, whether the threat is received by mail, \n     telephone, electronic mail, or through a computerized \n     messaging service.\n\n Section 1307: Increased penalties for recidivist and other sentencing \n                                changes\n\n       Amends 18 U.S.C. 1030(c) to increase penalties for those \n     who have previously violated any subsection of Sec. 1030. \n     This section provides that anyone who is convicted twice of \n     committing a computer offense under Sec. 1030 would be \n     subject to enhanced penalties.\n\n                      Section 1308: Civil actions\n\n       Limits damage to economic damages, where the violation \n     caused a loss of $1,000 or more during any one-year period. \n     No limit on damages would be imposed for violations that \n     modified or impaired the medical examination, diagnosis or \n     treatment of a person; caused physical injury to any person; \n     or threatened the public health or safety.\n\n                   Section 1309: Mandatory reporting\n\n       The current reporting requirement under Sec. 1030(a)(5) is \n     eliminated. By ensuring that most high technology crimes can \n     be prosecuted, there is less need for reporting requirements. \n     Convictions will provide more information on computer crime. \n     To create a mandatory reporting requirement is unnecessary \n     because private sector groups, such as the Forum of Incident \n     Response and Security Teams (FIRST), are leading the effort \n     to monitor computer crimes statistically.\n\n Section 1310: Sentencing for fraud and related activity in connection \n                            with computers.\n\n       Requires the United States Sentencing Commission to review \n     existing sentencing guidelines as they apply to sections 1030 \n     (a)(2), (a)(3), (a)(4), (a)(5), and (a)(6) of Title 18 of the \n     United States Code (The Computer Fraud and Abuse Act). The \n     Commission must also establish guidelines to ensure that \n     criminals convicted under these sections receive mandatory \n     minimum sentences for not less than 1 year. Currently, judges \n     are given great discretion in sentencing under the Computer \n     Fraud and Abuse Act. In many cases, the sentences don't match \n     the crimes; and criminals receive light sentences for serious \n     crimes. Mandatory minimum sentences will deter computer \n     ``hacking'' crimes, and protect the infrastructure of \n     computer systems.\n\n   Section 1311: Asset forfeiture for fraud and related activity in \n                       connection with computers\n\n       Amends 18 U.S.C. Sec. 1030(a)(2), (a)(3), and (a)(4) to \n     insure that individuals who commit crimes under the \n     aforementioned sections will forfeit the property used in \n     connection with those crimes. For example, computers and \n     ``hacking'' software used in crimes would be subject to \n     forfeiture.\n\n\n                  title xiv--computer software piracy\n\n                  Section 1401: Amendment of title 17\n\n       Amends 17 U.S.C. Sec. 506(a) to extend criminal \n     infringement of copyright to include any person--not just \n     those who acted for purposes of commercial advantage or \n     private financial gain--who willfully infringes a copyright. \n     Corrects the problem highlighted by the United States v. \n     LaMacchia, 871 F. Supp. 535 (D. Mass. 1994), that a person \n     could pirate software maliciously, so long as they received \n     no financial gain.\n\n                  Section 1402: Amendment of title 18\n\n       Amends 18 U.S.C. 2319 to allow the court, in imposing a \n     sentence on a person convicted of software piracy, to order \n     that the person forfeit any property used or intended to be \n     used to commit or promote the commission of such offense.\n\n\n                      title xv--internet gambling\n\n                  Section 1501: Amendment of title 18\n\n       Amends 18 U.S.C. Sec. 1084 to insure that individuals who \n     gamble or wager via wire or electronic communication are \n     penalized--not just those who are in the business of \n     gambling. Current statutes make it illegal only if you are in \n     the business of sports gambling on the INTERNET. This section \n     would make it illegal to gamble on ``virtual casinos'' as \n     well as electronic sports books.\n\n                  Section 1502: Sentencing guidelines\n\n       Requires the United States Sentencing Commission to review \n     the deterrent effect of existing sentencing guidelines as \n     they apply to sections 1084 of Title 18 and promulgate \n     guidelines to ensure that criminals convicted under section \n     1084 receive mandatory minimum sentences for not less than \n     one year.\n\n                  Section 1503: Reporting requirements\n\n       Requires the Attorney General to report to Congress on (1) \n     the problems associated with enforcing INTERNET gambling, (2) \n     recommendations for the best use of resources of the \n     Department of Justice to enforce section 1084 of Title 18, \n     (3) recommendations for the best use of the resources of FCC \n     to enforce section 1084 of title 18, and (4) an estimate on \n     the amount of gambling activity on the INTERNET. It is not \n     clear how effective law enforcement can police the INTERNET. \n     A report may answer that question.\n                                 ______\n\n\nBy Mr. SIMON (for himself, Mr. Hatch, Ms. Moseley-Braun, Mr. Bond, and \n                             Mr. Ashcroft):\n\n  S. 1496. A bill to grant certain patent right for certain non-\nsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs for a 2-year period; to the Committee \non the Judiciary.\n\n\n                 property right protection legislation\n\n  Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, today, I introduce legislation to grant for \na 2-year period additional property right protection for oxaprozin, an \nimportant drug in treating arthritis. Oxaprozin is a non-steroidal, \nanti-inflammatory drug [NSAID]. It is produced and marketed as Daypro \nby the G.D. Searle & Co., headquartered in Skokie, IL. I am introducing \nthis legislation as a matter of simple fairness and equity because of a \nprotracted review by the Food and Drug Administration [FDA] that \nconsumed the entire patent life of Daypro.\n  The Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, \ncommonly referred to as the Hatch-Waxman Act, was designed in part to \naddress the unfairness caused by unduly long FDA reviews. \nUnfortunately, the two major protections created by Hatch-Waxman did \nnot remedy Daypro's situation. First, Hatch-Waxman provides patent \nextensions in cases of regulatory delay. Ironically, since the FDA \nreview consumed Daypro's entire patent life, the delay rendered Daypro \nineligible for a patent extension; Hatch-Waxman simply did not \ncontemplate that an FDA review would consume the entire patent life of \na drug prior to its approval. Second, Hatch-Waxman allows up to 10 \nyears of market exclusivity to brand name drug manufacturers following \nprotracted FDA review. If the FDA had promptly approved Daypro, Daypro \nwould have been protected for 10 years; however, as a result of the \ndelay, Daypro only received 5 years of marketing exclusivity \nprotection.\n  The legislation I am introducing today would provide Daypro 2 years \nof property right protection beyond the 5 years provided in the Hatch-\nWaxman Act. This additional property right protection is being sought \nbecause the \n\n[[Page S19118]]\ndelay in obtaining FDA approval of Daypro was so excessive that the \nprovisions of the Hatch-Waxman Act are inadequate to compensate for the \ncomplete loss of patent protection for Daypro due to the FDA review.\n  I seek this remedy for a drug that was a victim of even more extreme \nregulatory delays than those that were instrumental in causing Congress \nto recognize that the Hatch-Waxman Act was necessary in the first \nplace. The Investigational New Drug Application [IND] for Daypro was \nfiled in 1972, and the New Drug Application [NDA] for Daypro was filed \n10 years later in August 1982. FDA approval of Daypro was not finally \ngranted until October 29, 1992. During the 20 years it took FDA to \napprove Daypro, its patent expired. Thus, the practical patent life for \nDaypro was zero.\n  A number of reports have been published by the U.S. General \nAccounting Office and congressional committees in both Houses on the \nregulatory problems that the class of NSAIDs faced in the 1980's. These \nreports and studies make it clear that at least some of the problems \nencountered at FDA were generic--the unprecedented delay in NSAID \napprovals was due to FDA inaction on all NDAIDs after serious problems \nwere encountered with previously approved NSAIDs. During this time, the \nFDA effectively imposed a moratorium on the approval of all NSAIDs. It \nis important to note that the purpose of this moratorium was not to \nallow the FDA to collect further data on Daypro or because there were \nconcerns about health and safety findings related to Daypro. The FDA \nultimately approved Daypro in 1992 as safe and efficacious based upon \nthe same studies originally submitted to the FDA in the NDA. it took \nthe FDA longer to approve Daypro than any other NSAID.\n  This legislation does not grant full recovery of the time lost while \nDaypro was under review; it does not grant even half of that time. The \nadditional property right protection that would be granted by this bill \nrepresents only some of the time lost after the drug applications had \nbeen under FDA review. This legislation provides 2 years of added \nprotection as partial compensation for the value lost when Daypro's \npatents expired while the drug application was pending at the FDA. I \nbelieve the figure of 2 years is a fair and equitable resolution of \nthis matter.\n  Daypro confronted an inordinate and inequitable delay in obtaining \nFDA approval. No other pharmaceutical that I am aware of has had its \nentire patent life consumed by an FDA review. I urge that the relief \nembodied in this legislation be anacted.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, today, I rise to cosponsor with Senators \nSimon, Moseley-Braun, Bond, and Ashcroft, S. 1496, a bill to extend for \n2 additional years the exclusive marketing period for the drug \noxaprozin.\n  I am supportive of Senator Simon's effort, because unusual, and \nperhaps unprecedented, administrative delays in review of this \npharmaceutical have denied the manufacturer any patent protection. The \nFood and Drug Administration [FDA] review of oxaprozin consumed the \nentire 17-year patent term plus another 4 years.\n  Some history on this issue may be useful at this point.\n  Oxaprozin is a nonsteroidal, anti-inflammatory drug, or NSAID. It is \nused to treat arthritis and other ailments. Oxaprozin was first \npatented by G.D. Searle in 1971. Shortly thereafter, an investigational \nnew drug [IND] application was submitted to FDA.\n  In August 1982, a new drug application [NDA] was filed, but FDA did \nnot approve the drug until October 29, 1992. In total, over 21 years \nexpired after submission of the IND application and over 10 years \nelapsed from the filing of the NDA.\n  As a result of this unusually long, and perhaps unprecedented, FDA \nregulatory review period, the patent for oxaprozin expired before \noxaprozin could be brought to market.\n  In the 1980s, Congress became concerned that the lengthy FDA pre-\nmarketing regulatory approval system was depriving many companies of a \nsubstantial amount of the potential economic value of new drug patents, \nand thereby decreasing the incentives that lead to new breakthrough \nmedications.\n  In 1984, Representative Henry Waxman and I worked to secure enactment \nof the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act, a law \nthat, in part, attempted to add patent term or an exclusive marketing \nperiod to partially restore time lost through FDA regulatory review.\n  Under this 1984 law--sometimes referred to as the ``Hatch-Waxman \nAct'' or ``Waxman-Hatch'' an administrative procedure was provided to \nextend certain drug patents or prevent generic copies from entering the \nmarketplace in order to provide compensation for at least some of the \ntime lost as a result of FDA regulatory review.\n  This legislation, however, did not contemplate extreme outliers such \nas oxaprozin.\n  In some respects, oxaprozin presents a classic Catch-22 situation: \nAdministrative patent extensions under Hatch-Waxman were not available \nuntil FDA approval was granted, but these administrative extensions \ncould only be granted if the term of the patent had not expired. If a \ndrug was not approved until after the expiration of the patent, no \nHatch-Waxman patent extension could be granted, even though such cases \nrepresent the most egregious example of the problem Congress was trying \nto redress in the first place.\n  In addition to patent extensions, the Hatch-Waxman Act contained \nmarketing exclusivity provisions to address cases such as oxaprozin in \nwhich no patent protection remains. The Hatch-Waxman law provided 10 \nyears of marketing exclusivity for pioneer drugs that were approved for \nmarketing between January 1, 1982 and September 23, 1984.\n  One result of oxaprozin's unduly long FDA review was that it could \nnot qualify for extended patent life under the Hatch-Waxman transition \nrule. Instead, oxaprozin received only the more limited 5-year period \nof marketing exclusivity even though its review period at the FDA \nexceeded all of those drugs that received a 10-year extension.\n  From 1974 until 1982, the FDA took, on average, only about 2 years to \nreview and approve NSAID product applications. From about 1982, \nhowever, there existed a de facto moratorium on the approval of new \nNSAIDs.\n  The Congress has examined the reasons behind this moratorium. In \n1992, both the Senate and House Judiciary Committees, and House Energy \nand Commerce Committee, conducted hearings into the FDA delays in the \napproval of NSAIDs. In addition, the Judiciary Committees requested the \nGAO to investigate this delay.\n  These examinations revealed that FDA faced an unusual set of \ncircumstances from 1982 through 1987. As a result of the controversy \nsurrounding four previously approved NSAIDs that raised serious post-\nmarketing safety concerns, the average time taken to approve NSAID NDAs \nnearly doubled. By concentrating its resources to investigate the \ncauses behind the reported NSAID adverse effects, the FDA directed its \nmanpower away from approval of the pending NSAID NDAs.\n  Mr. President, 2-weeks ago, the Senate was engaged in a debate that \ninvolved the sufficiency of the patent laws to help attract private \nsector investment into biomedical research. This issue has important \nramifications for the public health.\n  Over the next few months the Senate Judiciary Committee, on which I \nserve as Chairman, will be examining pharmaceutical patent issues. It \nwill be important for the committee to examine fully the complex \ninterrelationship between the patent laws and the FDA product review \nsystem for drugs.\n  Oxaprozin serves as an important case study of a flawed system in \nwhich FDA regulatory delay materially undermines the value of \nintellectual property. A regulatory review period of 21 years is simply \ntoo long. I hope we can all agree that the FDA review period should not \nexhaust the entire patent term of a drug product.\n  In light of the general disruption that occurred within the FDA NSAID \nreview division and the particular facts relating to the 21 year FDA \nreview of oxaprozin, the partial relief granted by S. 1496 is \njustified. I urge my colleagues to support this bill.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. NICKLES (for himself, Mr. Smith, Mr. Pryor, Mr. Bond, Mr. \n        Bumpers, Mr. Inhofe, Mr. Lott, Mr. Breaux, Mr. Johnston, Mr. \n        Abraham, Mr. Kempthorne, Mr. Lieberman, Mr. Faircloth, Mr. \n        Glenn, and Mr. Warner):\n        \n[[Page S19119]]\n\n  S. 1497. A bill to amend the Solid Waste Disposal Act to make certain \nadjustments in the land disposal program to provide needed flexibility, \nand for other purposes; to the Committee on Environment and Public \nWorks.\n\n\n           the land disposal program flexibility act of 1995\n\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, today I am joined by my colleagues \nSenators Smith, Pryor, Bond, Bumpers, Inhofe, Breaux, Lott, Johnston, \nAbraham, Kempthorne, Lieberman, Faircloth, Glenn, and Warner to \nintroduce, the Land Disposal Program Flexibility Act of 1995. This bill \nrepresents the culmination of a bipartisan process involving the \ncooperation of The White House, EPA, and the regulated community. It is \nproof that the desire for regulatory reform is real, and needed in this \ncountry. It is also proof that we can work together to make greater \nsense out of the regulatory morass when we set our minds to it.\n  For too long neither Congress which makes the laws, nor EPA which \nimplements them, have really been in charge of environmental protection \nin this country. The most significant driver in the field of \nenvironmental policy has been the courts. In a recent address before \nthe Environmental Law Institute, former EPA Administrator William \nRuckleshaus lamented that most of the important environmental decisions \nof the last quarter century have devolved to the courts.\n  The situation that has led to the introduction of this bill is a \nclassic case of how the courts, have dominated the making of \nenvironmental policy. In 1990, EPA implemented RCRA regulations \nrelating to the treatment of hazardous waste before it can be disposed \nof on the land. These land disposal restrictions were intended to \nprevent the placement of untreated waste on the ground--an appropriate \nconcern given the legacy of such practices prior to the enactment of \nRCRA. EPA also made every effort to implement this regulation taking \ncare to coordinate RCRA with the Clean Water Act and the Safe Drinking \nWater Act. That, too was as Congress intended.\n  Along came the courts and they chose to interpret the RCRA statute in \nsuch a way as to extend the reach of costly hazardous waste \nrequirements to nonhazardous wastes. This interpretation also ignored \nthe benefits of treatment and disposal systems such as surface \nimpoundments and underground injection wells permitted under the Clean \nWater and Safe Drinking Water Acts respectively.\n  As a result, EPA has been forced to propose expensive new regulations \nthat even the Agency believes will provide minimal environmental \nbenefit. Let me quote from EPA's very own preamble to the new proposed \nrule:\n\n       The risks addressed by this rule, particularly UIC wells, \n     are very small relative to the risks presented by other \n     environmental conditions or situations. In a time of limited \n     resources, common sense dictates that we deal with higher \n     risk activities first, a principle on which EPA, members of \n     the regulated community, and the public can all agree.\n       Nevertheless, the agency is required to set treatment \n     standards for these relatively low risk wastes and disposal \n     practices during the next two years, although there are other \n     actions and projects with which the Agency could provide \n     greater protection of human health and the environment.\n\n  Mr. President, this Senate has been wrestling with the larger \nquestion of comprehensive regulatory reform for some months now. The \ndebate on both sides of the aisle has been contentious over the means \nby which such reforms are achieved. But a common theme throughout that \ndebate has been the nearly universal recognition that the current \ncommand and control regulatory system is obsolete, and in need of \nreform. This bill allows us to turn that theme into reality. Not by \namending the underlying RCRA statute in any way, although we agree with \nthe President that further statutory reform is needed, but by merely \nrestoring EPA's original regulatory determination: that a waste that is \nno longer hazardous need not be regulated as if it was hazardous.\n  Mr. President, that is why I have joined with Senators Smith, Pryor, \nBond, Bumpers, Inhofe, Breaux, Lott, Johnston, Abraham, Kempthorne, \nLieberman, Faircloth, Glenn, and Warner to introduce this bill. I also \nsubmit for inclusion in the record a letter from the administration \nsupporting this legislation. The price of not acting soon will mean \nthat industry will incur, by EPA's own estimate, $800 million dollars \nper year in compliance costs--again for minimal environmental benefit. \nMr. President, we have an opportunity here, to provide true regulatory \nrelief, while assuring that effective standards of environmental \nprotection are maintained. We have worked in a bipartisan way to bring \nthis reform forward. I hope that the spirit of cooperation demonstrated \non all sides will carry through as we tackle this and other much needed \nregulatory reforms.\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I join my colleague, Senator Nickles, in \nintroducing the Land Disposal Program Flexibility Act of 1995, and I \nwould like to thank the senior Senator from Oklahoma for the time and \neffort that he and his staff have been spending on this issue. In \naddition to a bipartisan coalition of Senators who are cosponsoring \nthis legislation, this bill is also supported by the White House and \nthe Environmental Protection Agency [EPA].\n  This legislation represents a very simple, yet important modification \nto the Solid Waste Disposal Act that has the potential to save our \nsociety as much as $800 million in annual compliance costs--an expense \nthat the EPA agrees will provide no environmental benefit. As the \nchairman of the Superfund, Waste Control and Risk Assessment \nSubcommittee, which has jurisdiction over this legislation, I believe \nthat this bill is a good example of a cooperative, bipartisan effort to \ncorrect expensive and needless environmental overregulation.\n  Under the current land disposal restrictions [LDR's], individuals are \ngenerally prohibited from the land disposal of hazardous wastes unless \nthese wastes have first been treated to meet EPA standards. As a result \nof a 1993 decision by the D.C. Circuit Court, these LDR's would also be \nextended to nonhazardous wastes managed in wastewater systems that are \nalready regulated under the Clean Water Act or the underground \ninjection control [UIC] program of the Safe Drinking Water Act. The \ncourt adopted this position despite the fact that the EPA had \npreviously adopted a rule authorizing the appropriate treatment and \ndisposal of these materials, and despite the fact that the Agency \nbelieved that such strict standards are inappropriate.\n  Simply stated, this legislation would counteract the court decision, \nand would restore the EPA's original regulatory determination allowing \nthese materials to be safely treated and disposed of in permitted \ntreatment units and injection wells.\n  One of the issues confronting those who support this legislation is \ntiming. Due to the court decision, the EPA will be forced to impose \nthese needless and expensive requirements if Congress does not act very \nsoon. As the chairman of the subcommittee of jurisdiction, I will work \nclosely with the other interested parties to ensure that this \nlegislation will be addressed in a prompt fashion.\n  Again, I thank Senator Nickles for working with me on this issue, and \nI commend him for his involvement.\n  Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, I rise today to join my colleagues, \nSenators Bond, Bumpers, Inhofe, and Nickles, to introduce the Land \nDisposal Program Flexibility Act of 1995. This bill represents months \nof work by the EPA, the White House, both Houses of Congress, as well \nas the regulated community, to come together in a bipartisan manner to \nimplement real regulatory reform.\n  This legislation makes small adjustments in the current Land Disposal \nRegulations [LDR] Program under the Resource Conservation Recovery Act \n[RCRA], to provide more flexibility for the treatment of nonhazardous \nwaste. More importantly, it helps alleviate the type of over-regulation \nthat has been the source of so much controversy among the general \npublic. Our legislation achieves this goal by denying the \nimplementation of a court ordered rule that requires the EPA to treat \nnonhazardous waste as though it were hazardous waste.\n  Mr. President, when Congress passed the Resource Conservation and \nRecovery Act [RCRA] in 1976, it was intended to work as a campanion to \nother existing environmental laws. However, the court decision \npreviously mentioned, \n\n[[Page S19120]]\nwould create just the opposite of what was intended. It would require \nthe EPA to write a rule that would overlay RCRA requirements on top of \nexisting Clean Water Act treatment standards. The cost of this \nadditional treatment, according to EPA estimates, would be \napproximately $800 million per year--all to achieve what EPA says is \nalmost no environmental improvement.\n  What we are doing today with the introduction of the Land Disposal \nProgram Flexibility Act, is correcting this court decision by amending \na very narrow portion of the RCRA law. Simply put, we are asking \nCongress to clarify that the LDR Program does not apply to wastes that \nare no longer hazardous when managed in Clean Water and Safe Drinking \nWater Act systems.\n  I am proud to be an original cosponsor of this bill and I hope my \ncolleagues will support this legislation as it moves through committee \nto the Senate floor for a vote.\n      By Ms. SNOWE (for herself, Mr. Kerry, Mr. Cohen, and Mr. \n        Kennedy):\n  S. 1498. A bill to authorize appropriations to carry out the \nInterjurisdictional Fisheries Act of 1986, and for other purposes; to \nthe Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.\n\n\n        the interjurisdictional fisheries amendments act of 1995\n\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, today I, along with my colleague on the \nCommerce Committee, Senator Kerry, am introducing the \nInterjurisdictional Fisheries Amendments Act of 1995. I am pleased to \nalso have Senators Cohen and Kennedy joining us as cosponsors in this \neffort.\n  Congress passed the Interjurisdictional Fisheries Act in 1986 to \npromote the management of interjurisdictional fisheries resources \nthroughout their range, and to encourage and promote active State \nparticipation in the management of these important resources. The act \nprovides modest funding to the States and interstate marine fishery \ncommissions to assist with research and management activities, with the \nunderlying objective being the development and maintenance of healthy, \nrobust fish stocks. The act also authorizes aid to commercial fishermen \nwho have suffered losses as a result of fishery resource disasters.\n  The bill that we are introducing today extends the act's \nauthorization through 1998. It reduces the authorized appropriations \nlevel for apportionment to the States, maintains the current overall \nauthorization level for the Commerce Department, and provides a small \nincrease in the authorization level for assistance to the interstate \nfishery management commissions.\n  This bill also amends section 308(d) of the act, which deals with \ndisaster assistance to commercial fishermen. Earlier this year, the \nSecretary of Commerce declared fishery resource disasters impacting \ncommercial fishermen in the Northeast, Pacific Northwest, and the Gulf \nof Mexico, and he committed $53 million in already-appropriated funds \nto help mitigate the impacts of these disasters. In order to \neffectively operate these disaster relief programs, however, certain \nchanges must be made in the act's grant-making authority.\n  The current provision, for example, limits the kind of assistance \navailable under section 308(d) to direct grants to individual fishermen \nor fishing corporations. But recent analysis of disaster relief \nstrategies has revealed that, in some cases, aid to fishermen could be \nmore efficiently and effectively provided if it is provided indirectly, \nthrough States, local governments, or nonprofit organizations, who in \nturn would operate programs to help fishermen. This bill amends the \nstatute to allow for the provision of both direct and indirect forms of \nassistance.\n  The bill also lifts the current $100,000 cap on aid to individual \nfishermen. This cap makes the operation of a fishing vessel buy-back \nprogram, like the one currently planned for the New England groundfish \nfishery, impossible. The purchase price for many vessels bought out \nunder the program will exceed $100,000, and without a lifting of the \ncap, few fishermen will participate. Given the ongoing crisis in the \nNew England groundfish industry, we need to move forward with an \neffective, comprehensive buy-back quickly, and passage of this \namendment to section 308(d) is essential for us to do so.\n  Mr. President, this bill will contribute to the improvement of \nconditions in interjurisdictional fisheries around the country, and it \nwill assist fishing communities that are suffering the effects of \nfishery resource disasters. This is a bipartisan bill, and it will not \nrequire significant new federal expenditures. I hope that my colleagues \nwill support the bill when the Senate considers it in the next session.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, today I join Senators Snowe, Kennedy, and \nCohen in introducing the Interjurisdictional Fisheries Amendments Act \nof 1995. This legislation authorizes appropriations for State grants \nand Department of Commerce programs designed to manage \ninterjurisdictional fisheries, and amends the Interjurisdictional \nFisheries Act of 1986 to facilitate the use of available fisheries \ndisaster relief funds.\n  In 1986, we passed the Interjurisdictional Fisheries Act to support \nState activities related to the management of fisheries occurring in \nwaters under the jurisdiction of one or more States and the exclusive \neconomic zone [EEZ], and to promote management of these fisheries \nthroughout their range. This model establishes a mechanism for all who \nhave a major interest in managing a fishery extending over several \njurisdictions to work together to make key management decisions. It \nclearly works successfully. We must continue to support such \ncooperative partnerships.\n  The bill introduced today also contains important provisions which \nwill clear the way for dispersing previously appropriated economic \nassistance for fishing disaster relief in New England, the Gulf, and in \nthe Pacific Northwest.\n  In New England, this assistance will be used to alleviate the \neconomic hardships caused by the collapse of the traditional groundfish \nfishery. The New England Fishery Management Council has closed \nsignificant areas of prime fishing grounds on Georges Bank and is now \nconsidering the adoption of stricter fishing restrictions to rebuild \nthe groundfish stocks. Many New England fishermen can no longer draw a \nliving from the sea as they have for years before. They, their \nfamilies, and their communities face a severe economic crisis. I have \nsupported, and will continue to support, a comprehensive approach to \naddressing this fishery disaster. The New England Fishery Management \nCouncil has a tough job ahead in designing a rebuilding program. While \nthe Council continues to struggle with this issue, I have focused my \nefforts on providing economic assistance to the fishermen and the \nfishing communities during this crisis and rebuilding period.\n  In March 1995, NOAA announced a $2.0 million pilot program to buy \ngroundfish vessels and begin to address the problem of too many \nfishermen chasing too few fish. The program began in June of 1995, and \non October 11, 1995, NOAA announced that it would be able to buy back \n13 vessels. Although the $2 million falls far short of the total amount \nneeded for a full-scale buyout in New England, the pilot program \nanswered many questions about the design, implementation, and potential \nsuccess of an expanded vessel buyout program.\n  The pilot program has demonstrated that fishing vessel owners are \nwilling to participate in such a program--114 vessel owners applied to \nparticipate in the pilot program. If funding was available to accept \nall 114 offers received--totalling $52 million--groundfish fishing \ncapacity could be decreased by more than 31 percent. This illustrates \nthat such a program could be a successful way to reduce the \novercapitalization in the groundfish fleet and may help ease the \neconomic impact of the collapsed groundfish fishery and the strict \nconservation measures anticipated.\n  The legislation we are introducing today amends the existing \nInterjurisdictional Fisheries Act of 1986 to facilitate the development \nof an expanded buyout program in New England. This would allow some \nfishermen to voluntarily leave the fishery, thereby reducing excess \nfishing capacity. As a condition of the program, the bill would require \nthat adequate conservation and management measures be in place to \nrestore the stocks and ensure no new boats enter the New England \ngroundfish fishery. It would also expedite fishery disaster relief \nprograms designed for the Gulf and the Pacific Northwest.\n\n[[Page S19121]]\n\n  I urge my colleagues to move quickly to pass the Interjurisdictional \nFisheries Amendment Act of 1995.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. HATFIELD:\n  S. 1499. A bill to amend the Interjurisdictional Fisheries Act of \n1986 to provide for direct and indirect assistance for certain persons \nengaged in commercial fisheries, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.\n\n\n                the fishing families relief act of 1995\n\n  Mr. HATFIELD. Mr. President, the Pacific Northwest has been presented \nwith a number of significant challenges in the last decade. Most \nrecently, heavy rains and winds in excess of 100 miles per hour ravaged \nthe Oregon coast and the Willamette Valley. Additionally, the timber \nand fishing industries, which once constituted a substantial portion of \nOregon's economy, have been severely restricted in recent years. Many \nindividuals involved in those industries have been forced to find \nalternative sources of employment.\n  In 1994, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration [NOAA] \nand the Pacific Northwest States initiated three programs to mitigate \nthe financial hardship caused by the total closure of the coastal \nsalmon fishing season. These programs were designed to assist the \nfishers impacted by the closing and include: a permit buyback program--\nWashington State only; a habitat restoration jobs program; and a data \ncollection and at sea research jobs program. Both jobs programs \nemployed over 100 dislocated fishers while contributing to the \nimprovement of fishery habitat. NOAA has approved the request of the \nGovernors of Oregon and Washington for an additional $13 million to \ncontinue these programs for a second year.\n  The changes in the Interjurisdicitonal Fisheries Act made by the \nlegislation I am introducing today would allow these three programs to \ncontinue working for dislocated fishers who are severely limited in \ntheir ability to earn a living through commercial fishing. The current \nlanguage restricts the number of dislocated fishers who have been \neligible to participate in these programs. Additionally, fishers may \nlose the eligibility to participate in the programs due to the \nuninsured loss determination and the cap on assistance.\n  Mr. President, this legislation does not seek additional Federal \nfunds for these important assistance programs. However, it does attempt \nto find ways to spend Federal dollars in a more effective and flexible \nmanner, with broader participation from those the funds are intended to \nserve. This legislation will also be beneficial for the fishing \nindustries in the Northeast and the Gulf Coast areas. I urge my \ncolleagues to give their full consideration to this attempt to restore \neconomic stability to the fisherman of Oregon and the Pacific \nNorthwest.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/12/21/senate-section/article/S19110-7", "month": "12", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "21", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S19121]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL COSPONSORS\n\n\n                                 s. 281\n\n  At the request of Mr. D'Amato, the name of the Senator from \nConnecticut [Mr. Lieberman] was added as a cosponsor of S. 281, a bill \nto amend title 38, United States Code, to change the date for the \nbeginning of the Vietnam era for the purpose of veterans benefits from \nAugust 5, 1964, to December 22, 1961.\n\n\n                                s. 1228\n\n  At the request of Mr. Feingold, his name was added as a cosponsor of \nS. 1228, a bill to impose sanctions on foreign persons exporting \npetroleum products, natural gas, or related technology to Iran.\n\n\n                                s. 1266\n\n  At the request of Mr. Mack, the name of the Senator from Indiana [Mr. \nLugar] was added as a cosponsor of S. 1266, a bill to require the Board \nof Governors of the Federal Reserve System to focus on price stability \nin establishing monetary policy to ensure the stable, long-term \npurchasing power of the currency, to repeal the Full Employment and \nBalanced Growth Act of 1978, and for other purposes.\n\n\n                                s. 1354\n\n  At the request of Mr. Breaux, the name of the Senator from Alaska \n[Mr. Murkowski] was added as a cosponsor of S. 1354, a bill to approve \nand implement the OECD Shipbuilding Trade Agreement.\n\n\n                                s. 1426\n\n  At the request of Mr. Simpson, his name was added as a cosponsor of \nS. 1426, a bill to eliminate the requirement for unanimous verdicts in \nFederal court.\n\n\n                                s. 1470\n\n  At the request of Mr. McCain, the name of the Senator from \nPennsylvania [Mr. Santorum] was added as a cosponsor of S. 1470, a bill \nto amend title II of the Social Security Act to provide for increases \nin the amounts of allowable earnings under the Social Security earnings \nlimit for individuals who have attained retirement age, and for other \npurposes.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/12/21/senate-section/article/S19121-1", "month": "12", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "21", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S19121]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   SENATE CONCURRENT RESOLUTION 37--TO MAKE TECHNICAL CHANGES IN THE \n                        ENROLLMENT OF H.R. 2539\n\n  Mr. EXON submitted the following resolution; which was considered and \nagreed to:\n\n                            S.

Mr. President, I am pleased to support this bill \nand would like to submit this statement for the Record and to clarify \nthat the language contained in the proposed legislation adds to the \ntypes of retirement income eligible for exemption. This language \nclearly intends to exempt from tax nonqualified deferred compensation \nthat constitutes legitimate retirement income. Because it affects \nretirement income, only income from qualified retirement plans and \nnonqualified retirement plans that are paid out over at least 10 years, \nor from a mirror-type nonqualified plan after termination of \nemployment, is exempt from State taxation.\n  The language does not prohibit States from imposing an income tax on \nnon-residents' regular wages or compensation. Cash bonuses or other \ncompensation arrangements that defer the receipt of salary, bonuses, \nand other types of wage-related compensation that are not paid out over \nat least 10 years or from a mirror-type nonqualified retirement plan \nare not exempt from State taxation. One example would be if a salary is \nearned in a State by an individual, whether a resident or nonresident, \nbut is voluntarily deferred for a few years until the individual exits \nthe state, and then is paid over in a lump sum, even while the \nindividual is still employed by the company, that kind of payment \nshould not qualify for exemption from nonresident taxation of pensions. \nIt is the intent of this bill to permit the States to continue to tax \nthis income, while protecting from taxation those deferred payments \nthat are for retirement income, paid from plans designed for that \npurpose.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/12/21/senate-section/article/S19129-2", "month": "12", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "21", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S19129-S19130]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            HENRY KNOTT, SR.\n\n Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I am proud to join with the \nBaltimore community and the friends of education throughout Maryland in \nhonoring the memory of Henry Knott, Sr., an exemplary family man and a \ngreat philanthropist. Mr. Knott was an extraordinary citizen whose \npublic generosity \n\n[[Page S19130]]\nranks him with the great names of Baltimore and Maryland philanthropy.\n  Henry Knott who died recently at the age of 84, began his working \ndays in the 1920's as a bricklayer in his father's construction \nbusiness. This first and humble job would lay the foundation to a \ncelebrated career in real estate and development over the course of \nseven decades. The achievement of his distinguished building career is \nreflected in apartment buildings, residences, and commercial centers \nwhich are located in Baltimore and its surrounding communities.\n  What singles out Henry Knott is that he translated his success with \nbricks and mortar into extraordinary philanthropy by graciously \ndonating huge amounts of his personal wealth to Maryland educational \ninstitutions, including his alma mater Loyola College, and also to many \nlocal hospitals. A modest philanthropist, Mr. Knott was one who deeply \nrespected the value of a quality education.\n  Henry Knott was also a man who practiced what he preached. A devout \ncommunicant of the Roman Catholic Church, he and his wife of over 67 \nyears, Marion Burr Knott, raised a wonderful family of 12 children, 51 \ngrandchildren, and 55 great grandchildren.\n  I extend my most sincere sympathies to his wife Marion, their \nchildren, and to all of the family and friends of Henry Knott, Sr. Mr. \nPresident, I ask that an article from the Baltimore Sun that pays \ntribute to Mr. Knott be printed in the Record.\n  The article follows:\n\n                [From the Baltimore Sun, Nov. 27, 1995]\n\n              Henry Knott, Sr. Dies; Philanthropist Was 89\n\n\n        Construction tycoon gave fortunes to hospitals, schools\n\n                 (By Marcia Myers and David Folkenflik)\n\n       Henry J. Knott Sr., the hard-driving multimillionaire \n     developer renowned for his prodigious philanthropy, died \n     yesterday at Johns Hopkins Hospital after a brief illness. He \n     was 89.\n       Mr. Knott, who had entered the hospital recently for \n     surgery, later contracted pneumonia, which was listed as the \n     cause of death.\n       He started work as a bricklayer with his father's \n     construction company in the 1920s but rose through business \n     as a brick contractor and made his fortune developing real \n     estate. Much of that fortune he gave to Maryland colleges, \n     schools and hospitals, with gifts that particularly linked \n     his name to Loyola College, Hopkins Hospital and the state's \n     Roman Catholic schools.\n       Those who knew Mr. Knott attributed his success to his \n     lifelong industriousness.\n       ``His interest was work. He was a workaholic,'' said Joseph \n     M. Knott, Mr. Knott's youngest brother and godson. Hobbies \n     held less attraction, Joseph Knott said, ``He wasn't \n     interested in golf. He never belonged to any of the country \n     clubs. He said he couldn't afford it.''\n       There were few things Henry Knott could not afford during \n     his adult life. His personal wealth, estimated at $150 \n     million in 1987, included major holdings in the Arundel Corp. \n     (before its sale the following year to Florida Rock \n     Industries for $88 million), Henry A. Knott Home Builders and \n     Knott Enterprises.\n       Mr. Knott's companies built thousands of homes and \n     businesses in Baltimore, including apartment buildings, \n     rowhouses and shopping centers that dot the metropolitan area \n     from Essex to Lansdowne and from Kingsville to Catonsville.\n       The reach of his family was almost as wide as that of his \n     businesses. Mr. Knott and his wife of 67 years, Marion Burke \n     Knott, raised 12 children. At his death, Mr. Knott left 51 \n     grandchildren and 55 great-grandchildren.\n       ``He had three very intense interests: his family, the \n     Catholic Church and his work,'' said Rick O. Berndt, a lawyer \n     for the Archdiocese of Baltimore who knew Mr. Knott for \n     almost 30 years.\n       Cardinal William H. Keeler was visiting with the Knott \n     family last night.\n       Through a spokesman, he said, ``We mourn the passing of \n     Henry Knott, whose deep faith and extraordinary charity will \n     long be remembered. I pray that God may comfort his dear \n     wife, Marion, and all his family. Catholic education in \n     Maryland at every level has benefited from the vision and \n     generosity of Henry Knott.''\n       Mr. Knott gave millions to charity, primarily Catholic \n     educational institutions such as Loyola College, his alma \n     mater; the College of Notre Dame of Maryland; Mount St. \n     Mary's College, Emmitsburg; and the University of Notre Dame, \n     South Bend, Ind. By 1988, the Knotts' charitable \n     contributions had exceeded $140 million.\n       ``He was highly disciplined and unbelievably focused about \n     whatever he was doing. You could not distract him,'' said Mr. \n     Berndt, who was a 26-year-old fledgling attorney when he met \n     Mr. Knott.\n       ``I was very idealistic and had many thoughts about how the \n     world should work,'' Mr. Berndt recalled. ``Mr. Knott was one \n     of the ones who regularly brought me down to earth. He was \n     great at the art of what was possible.''\n       In 1988, Mr. Knott and his wife created a $26 million fund \n     to benefit 31 local educational, health and cultural \n     institutions.\n       Among the recipients were the Johns Hopkins Oncology \n     Center, which received $5 million, and the Baltimore Symphony \n     Orchestra, which was given $1 million. Four Baltimore \n     hospitals, St. Joseph, Mercy, St. Agnes and Bon Secours, each \n     received $1 million to establish an income fund to provide \n     medical care for the poor.\n\n\n                           schaefer's sorrow\n\n       ``I talked to Mr. Knott's son the other day. He told me \n     that Mr. Knott would not get out of this one,'' former Gov. \n     William Donald Schaefer said. ``I had a real, great sorrow \n     overcome me. Mr. Knott was truly one of the great men of our \n     times, perhaps of all times. He was one of the great pillars \n     of Baltimore.''\n       Mr. Knott's largess seemed at odds with his public persona \n     as a gruff, demanding businessman. Yet associates insisted \n     that he was, in private, the antithesis of that image.\n       Peter G. Angelos, Orioles owner and former city councilman, \n     knew Mr. Knott for more than 25 years and took issue with \n     what he characterized as a public impression of Mr. Knott as \n     ``a hard-nosed businessman bent on accumulating most of the \n     money in Maryland.''\n       Rather, Mr. Angelos said, he came to know Mr. Knott as \n     ``the very gentle person he really is,'' and as an individual \n     who, in private conversation, was fond of discussing broad \n     intellectual subjects, often quoting Plato or Aristotle to \n     make his point.\n       ``He's made a lot of money because he drives a hard \n     bargain, but an honest bargain,'' Mr. Angelos said.\n       Mr. Knott was among the first to sign on when Mr. Angelos \n     pulled together local investors to buy the Baltimore Orioles \n     in 1993.\n       ``He expects a lot from most people, but he expects the \n     most from himself,'' said Mr. Angelos.\n       The late Rev. Joseph A. Sellinger, S.J., president of \n     Loyola College, once characterized Mr. Knott as a ``pussy \n     cat'' inside a gruff exterior.\n       Mr. Knott's own summation of his talent for accumulating \n     money and then giving it away was made in four short \n     sentences quoted in a Baltimore magazine profile in 1987.\n       ``It's like catching fish,'' he said. ``You get up early. \n     You fill the boat up with fish. And then you give them all \n     away before they all start to rot.''\n       The Rev. Harold E. Ridley Jr., president of Loyola, said \n     that Mr. Knott maintained a becoming modesty in not seeking \n     credit for his gifts. ``I think that is what made him such an \n     extraordinary individual: His legendary generosity was \n     tempered by an even greater humility,'' Father Ridley said\n       The Knott family lived in a large house on Guilford's \n     Greenway during the years in which the 12 children were \n     growing up. Friends jokingly called the home ``the Stork \n     Club''--partly after the posh New York restaurant of the \n     period, but mostly because of the children.\n       As word spread of the dynamic household, Mrs. Knott became \n     the subject of newspaper feature articles in which she \n     explained how she managed her day, getting the children \n     through breakfast and off to school, darning socks and \n     mediating squabbles among a very energetic brood.\n       ``My family is my club life and outside interests,'' she \n     said in a 1952 interview.\n       Meanwhile, Mr. Knott built houses, apartment buildings and \n     shopping centers, acquiring a reputation as a can-do \n     contractor.\n       In addition to his building ventures, he became active in a \n     broad range of business and civic activities. He served on \n     Maryland's Advisory Committee on Higher Education in 1964, he \n     became chairman and CEO of the Arundel Corp. and its largest \n     stockholder in 1967 and he headed former Gov. Marvin Mandel's \n     re-election committee in 1974.\n\n\n                           mr. knott's family\n\n       In addition to his wife, Mr. Knott is survived by his \n     children: Patricia K. Smyth, Alice K. Voelkel, Margaret K. \n     Riehl, Henry J. Knott Jr., Catherine K. Wies, Rose Marie K. \n     Porter, Lindsay K. Harris, Francis X. Knott, James F. Knott, \n     Martin G. Knott, and Mary Stuart K. Rodgers, all of \n     Baltimore; and Marion K. McIntyre, of Del Ray Beach, Fla.; \n     brothers, John L. Knott, the Rev. Francis X. Knott, S.J., and \n     Joseph M. Knott, all of Baltimore; 51 grandchildren and 55 \n     great-grandchildren.\n       Visiting hours will be 2 p.m. to 4 p.m. and 7 p.m. to 9 \n     p.m. today and tomorrow at St. Mary's Seminary, 5400 Roland \n     Ave, with a funeral Mass at 11 a.m. Wednesday at the \n     Cathedral of Mary Our Queen, 5200 N.

Mr. President, I want to congratulate the \nMitsubishi Electric America Foundation on the occasion of its fifth \nanniversary.\n  The Mitsubishi Electric America Foundation [MEAF] is endowed with \n\n[[Page S19131]]\n  $15 million by the Mitsubishi Electric Corp. of Japan and its American \nsubsidiaries. Its mission is to contribute to society by assisting \nyoung Americans with disabilities to lead full and productive lives. \nThe foundation fulfills this mission by supporting education and other \nprograms aimed at enhancing the independence, productivity and \ncommunity inclusion of young people with disabilities. During its first \n5 years the foundation has received more than 1,000 funding requests \nand awarded nearly $2 million in grants to benefit American children \nand youth with disabilities.\n  The foundation is based in Washington, DC and works primarily at the \nnational level but also collaborates with principal Mitsubishi Electric \nAmerica [MEA] facilities to have an impact at the local level. \nPhilanthropy committees at MEA companies have made many generous \ncontributions of money, electronics products, and volunteer support to \nnonprofit organizations in communities across the country.\n  In my home state of Illinois, for example, Mitsubishi Electric \nIndustrial Controls, Inc., and Mitsubishi Electronics America, Inc. \nmaintain active volunteer committees through which dedicated employees \nserve their communities in the Chicago suburbs. Through its matching \ngrant program, the foundation supplements the companies' donations to \nlocal organizations helping young people with disabilities.\n  The story behind the foundation's creation gives insight into the \nsponsoring corporation. At the 1990 meeting of the presidents of the \nNorth American Mitsubishi Electric America group companies, former MEA \npresident Takeshi Sakurai presented his goal of encouraging the \ncompanies to reciprocate the good will and hospitality of the \ncommunities in which the more than 4,000 MEA employees live and work.\n  Focusing on the challenges and barriers that exist for people with \ndisabilities, Mr. Sakurai urged the corporation to help ensure that \nyoung Americans with disabilities have full access to competitive \nemployment, integrated education, independent living options, and \nrecreational opportunities in their communities. With the establishment \nof a foundation, he declared, the companies and employees could \ncontribute to this critical need through the donation of funds, \nproducts, and volunteer time. Following Mr. Sakurai's presentation, \nmany of the senior executives around the table made personal donations, \nwhich eventually formed part of the initial endowment of the Mitsubishi \nElectric America Foundation.\n  Takeshi Sakurai became the first board president of the foundation, \nand with the board of directors worked to strengthen support for the \nfoundation's work within the corporation, develop strategies for its \noutreach to the disability community, and institutionalize philanthropy \nwithin the corporate culture of MEA companies. Through the efforts of \nits board, the foundation has helped to educate its sponsoring \ncorporations about the importance of good corporate citizenship and on \nthe critical issues facing people with disabilities. The 12-member \nboard includes Mitsubishi Electric America company presidents, the \nfoundation's executive director, representatives from the parent \ncorporation in Japan, and two MEA employees who are nominated by their \npeers to serve 18-month terms.\n  Mitsubishi Electric Corp.'s investments in the foundation have paid \nunexpected dividends by influencing the sponsoring corporation back in \nJapan. Responding to the success of the foundation, Mitsubishi Electric \nCorp. has expanded its philanthropic activities in Japan and around the \nworld; many of these efforts are aimed at people with disabilities.\n  The Socio-Roots Fund, which was established by the corporation in \n1992 to match employee donations, awarded the yen equivalent of \n$450,000 to organizations assisting youths with disabilities in Japan \nin 1994. The corporation's Nakatsugawa Works facility now offers sign \nlanguage classes to its employees. The corporation also donated the yen \nequivalent of $180,000 to 75 schools, organizations and projects \nserving people with disabilities throughout Japan. A second Mitsubishi \nElectric Foundation was established in Thailand to provide promising \nstudents who are in need of financial assistance with the means to \ncomplete their education; in June, 1993, this foundation awarded its \nfirst full scholarships to 30 engineering students.\n  The foundation has received several awards for its achievements in \ngrantmaking, some of which clearly demonstrate the foundation's impact \non the MEA companies. For example, the foundation was honored with the \nprestigious Leadership Award from the Dole Foundation for Employment of \nPeople with Disabilities. My colleague from Kansas, Senator Bob Dole, \npresented the award in recognition of the foundation's accomplishments \nand also cited Mitsubishi Electric America as a model for other \ncorporations in integrating disability awareness into corporate \npolicies.\n  The MEA foundation and Marriott foundation for People with \nDisabilities jointly received the Council for Exceptional Children's \n1992-93 Employer of the Year Award, in recognition of their successful \nreplication of the ``Bridges . . . From School to Work'' transition \nprogram, which helps prepare youth with disabilities in Washington, DC \nfor employment after high school.\n  In 1994, Mitsubishi Electric America was named one of the top 100 \nU.S. employers by CAREERS and the disABLED, a leading magazine in the \ndisability field, based on a reader survey that asked readers to name \nthe top three companies or government agencies for whom they would most \nlike to work or that they believed would provide a positive working \nenvironment for people with disabilities.\n  These public acknowledgements are a fitting tribute to the Mitsubishi \nElectric Corp.'s investments in our Nation, but I would like to add my \nown personal thanks to the Mitsubishi Electric America foundation, \nMitsubishi Electric Corp., and the Mitsubishi Electric America group \ncompanies for their generosity.\n  I congratulate the staff, officers, board of directors, and advisory \ncommittee members who have helped position this foundation as a leader \nin supporting innovative programs for young people with disabilities. I \nhope the foundation will continue its successful work for many years to \ncome.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/12/21/senate-section/article/S19130-1", "month": "12", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "21", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S19131]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        IN MEMORIAM, PAN AM 103\n\n Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I rise today to note with \nsolemnity the anniversary of the bombing of Pan Am flight 103 over \nLockerbie, Scotland. It is now 7 years since that infamous act which \nclaimed the lives of 270 people. All the more vile because its \nperpetrators still have not been brought to trial.\n  Despite a regime of international sanctions, the Libyan government \nrefuses to extradite the indicted terrorists. A state which harbors \noutlaws must, of necessity, remain an outlaw state. The United States \nand our allies ought never to waver in our commitment to the rule of \nlaw and the measures necessary to enforce it.\n  On November 3, I joined the families of the victims and President \nClinton at Arlington National Cemetery for the dedication of a memorial \ncairn. On that occasion the President reminded us that ``we must never, \nnever relax our efforts until the criminals are brought to justice.'' I \nemphatically concur.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/12/21/senate-section/article/S19131-1", "month": "12", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "21", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S19131-S19132]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             ARNOLD SHAPIRO\n\n Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, recent studies have indicated \nthat the violent crime rates are decreasing in many cities, but that \nthere is a disturbing rise of violent crimes being committed by teen-\nagers.\n  I think there is no more important issue facing this Congress than \nviolence. Congress must take steps to reduce violent acts--in the home, \nin the workplace, and on our streets --that occur with numbing \nfrequency in America.\n  I have been particularly troubled by the content of many programs \nthat air on television networks in this country. Ultra-violent acts \nappear almost around the clock. While I have spoken out frequently \nabout the problem of television violence, I also wanted to take a \nmoment to praise an upcoming television documentary that details \n\n[[Page S19132]]\nthe positive steps taken by many companies to help troubled and \ndisadvantaged kids.\n  ``Everybody's Business: America's Children,'' a network documentary \nproduced by the Oscar- and Emmy-Award winning Arnold Shapiro, will air \nthis Saturday, December 23 from 8 p.m. to 9 p.m.\n  This program showcases the volunteer and funding efforts made \npossible by many American companies and corporations to help troubled \nand disadvantaged kids. Katie Couric is the host of this special which \npraises many companies for providing mentoring programs and community \nsupport efforts to support our children.\n  During this holiday season, it is particularly refreshing to see a \nnetwork television program which promotes the good deeds of American \ncompanies.\n  As we look ahead into the coming year, it is my hope that more \ntelevision programs will give this type of positive reinforcement to \nAmerica's companies that make an investment in our youth.\n  It also gives me pleasure to note the program is produced by one of \nLos Angeles's leading producers, Arnold Shapiro. He is well known for \nhis quality programs and documentaries, including ``Scared Straight'' \nand ``Scared Straight: Exposing and Ending Child Abuse.'' He recently \nwon the Peabody Award for his CBS children's special, ``Break the \nSilence: Kids Against Child Abuse.''\n  Arnold Shapiro's brand of television--straight forward, informative \nand educational--is exactly the type of programming I hope to see more \nof on network television in the coming years.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/12/21/senate-section/article/S19131-2", "month": "12", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "21", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S19132-S19133]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ISRAEL ``IZZY'' COHEN\n\n Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to a \ncelebrated member of the Maryland business community, Mr. Israel \n``Izzy'' Cohen, who recently passed away at the age of 83. As the \nchairman of Giant Food, Inc. Izzy Cohen managed one of Maryland's and \nthe Capital area's most successful corporations--and he accomplished \nthis task with deep respect for his employees and a commitment to his \ncommunity.\n  Izzy Cohen's warm personality, devotion to customers and Giant \nemployees is legendary. These were the talents that earned him the \nnomination of generations of employees and patrons. Under his \nleadership, Giant Foods pioneered in consumer information and \ninvolvement. His commitment to community was also reflected in his \nstrong support of the educational television program, ``It's \nAcademic,'' and in his many other fundraising activities. One notable \nexample is Computers for Kids where customers save their Giant receipts \nand schools collect them for money for classroom computers and \nequipment. Thousands of children across the State of Maryland have \nbenefited from Izzy Cohen's patronage of these programs.\n  Izzy Cohen was truly an accomplished leader in commerce, and one of \nthose outstanding citizens who by example and action evoked the very \nbest in all of us. I extend my most sincere sympathies to all the \nfamily and friends of Izzy Cohen. Mr. President, I ask that the \nfollowing articles from the Washington Post that pay tribute to Izzy \nCohen be printed in the Record.\n  The articles follow:\n\n               [From the Washington Post, Nov. 24, 1995]\n\nIsrael Cohen, Chairman of Giant Food, Dies at 83 Cancer Cliams Pioneer \n                        In Supermarket Industry\n\n                           (By Claudia Levy)\n\n       Israel Cohen, the Giant Food Inc. chairman who built his \n     company into the largest regional grocery store chain in the \n     nation, died late Wednesday at his home in Washington at the \n     age of 83. He had non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, a form of cancer.\n       A pioneer in an industry where razor-thin profit margins \n     quickly separate the winners from the losers, ``Izzy'' Cohen \n     was the principal architect in the rise of Giant from a \n     single store on Georgia Avenue to what many analysts say is \n     the premier regional supermarket chain in the nation.\n       Washington area consumers today spend 44.8 cents of every \n     grocery dollar at Giant, largely because of Cohen's business \n     savvy.\n       Cohen was one of the wealthiest people in the Washington \n     area and an important member of the local business community. \n     Yet he remained a very private person, talking little about \n     himself or his personal life, and worked in relative \n     obscurity.\n       But ``as a retailer he had no fear,'' said business \n     consultant Sheldon ``Bud'' Fantle, former chairman of \n     People's Drug Stores Inc. ``All of his ideas were before the \n     fact. He was a leader.''\n       Cohen commended a tight-knit organization that now includes \n     164 stores, largely in suburban neighborhoods, from New \n     Jersey to Northern Virginia. Its headquarters is in Landover \n     in Prince George's County, and 107 of its stores are in the \n     Washington area. Giant has more than 26,000 employees and \n     annual sales of $3.7 billion.\n       The Giant real estate division, GFS Realty Inc., owns or \n     manages 27 shopping centers in the Washington area. Giant \n     also owns a bakery, a dairy, an ice cream plant, a soft-drink \n     plant, a plastic milk container manufacturing plant and other \n     food-processing businesses.\n       Under Cohen, Giant advertised heavily in newspapers and was \n     quick to employ such marketing innovations as bulk sales, in-\n     store pharmacies and products labeled with Giant's private \n     brand names. It hired former White House counselor Esther \n     Peterson as its first consumer adviser, promoted her heavily \n     and listened seriously to the customers. Giant was the first \n     chain in the country to install computer price scanners at \n     checkouts, now standard in the industry.\n       ``This is the best businessman in Washington in his time,'' \n     said Donald E. Graham, chairman of The Washington Post Co. \n     and publisher of The Post. ``He built a great company in a \n     completely personal way. Everyone in Giant down to the \n     cashiers knew who they worked for and they knew it because \n     every week of his life he visited some Giant store. He \n     didn't just visit, he spent time,'' stopping to help \n     customers if needed.\n       Cohen made it a point to promote from within, to the extent \n     of training company employees for sophisticated technical \n     jobs, Graham said. ``Every year, Giant relentlessly worked to \n     gain slivers of market shares,'' building it to the largest \n     in the country, Graham said.\n       Fantle said Cohen ``was always two or three steps ahead of \n     his competition.'' Fantle's drug stores went head to head \n     with Giant's in-house pharmacies.\n       For years Giant has had the highest profit margins among \n     Washington area supermarkets--3 percent in an industry where \n     the national average is 1 percent. Much of that margin came \n     from the profit of his drugstore operations and the fact that \n     Giant Food was a ``vertically integrated'' company that \n     manufactured everything from milk cartons to ice cream and \n     soda for its private brands.\n       Cohen would say this was a result of having ``smart persons \n     to make decisions around here,'' Graham said, ``But everybody \n     else would give him the credit.''\n       Fantle said ``He ran a bright, clean store with good \n     values. And certainly he had the knack of advertising. . . \n     .''\n       When Cohen's longtime partners in Giant, members of the \n     Lehrman family, agreed to sell their share in the corporation \n     to a British supermarket chain in 1994, control of Giant \n     remained with Cohen, who owned half the voting stock and \n     controlled four of the seven seats on the board of directors.\n       Giant announced yesterday that four senior officers and \n     Cohen's sister, Lillian Cohen Solomon, will now vote his \n     stock and manage Giant.\n       Cohen had controlled the company since 1964, when his \n     father, company cofounder Nehemiah Meir ``N.M.'' Cohen, \n     retired. For a period, Washington attorney Joseph B. \n     Danzansky was chairman, a compromise choice resulting from a \n     dispute between Giant's founding families. But it was a \n     titular post, and Cohen ran the operation.\n       Israel Cohen was born in Rishon-Le-Zion, Palestine, where \n     his father was a rabbi and teacher in a one-room school. The \n     Cohen family settled in Lancaster, Pa., when Israel Cohen was \n     9.\n       N.M. Cohen at first operated a kosher butcher shop. In the \n     mid-1930s, he went into partnership in Washington with Samuel \n     Lehrman, a Harrisburg, Pa., food distributor, to begin a \n     self-service grocery store of the sort coming into vogue in \n     California.\n       They selected Washington because they believed that federal \n     employees would form a reliable customer base. The first \n     store opened in the midst of a snowstorm on Feb. 6, 1936, on \n     Georgia Avenue at Park Road NW. Issy Cohen worked at the \n     store along with his brother, Manny, stocking shelves and \n     driving the company's truck.\n       Izzy Cohen served in the Army during World War II and after \n     the war began to rise through administrative positions in the \n     Giant company, patterning his understated business style \n     after his father, who retired in 1964.\n       Izzy Cohen took a year off in the 1950s to recover from \n     tuberculosis, which he had contracted in the Army, and used \n     the time to become a master bridge player. He was known to \n     fellow tournament players for his ``poker'' face, a card \n     player's best asset. He owned a condominium in Miami, where \n     he often went to play cards, and a stable of horses at Laurel \n     Race Course.\n       Cohen set about expanding the Giant empire despite \n     increased competition, which in recent years has included \n     warehouse grocery firms and others. One key to its success, \n     Cohen told stockholders, was ``having our people fully \n     understand both the nature of what is a competitive war and \n     what their role is in the fight.''\n       On his visits to stores, Cohen would pitch in to bag \n     groceries when the checkout lines were getting too long, \n     Giant President Pete L. Manos recalled yesterday. Cohen would \n     point out that the unshelled peanut bin needed a scoop or \n     that a sign was wrong, Manos said. He'd stop to talk to \n     customers \n\n[[Page S19133]]\n     and would inspect the produce rooms and meat lockers for cleanliness, \n     Manos said.\n       When it was known that he was going to visit a store, some \n     employees whose shifts were over ``would wait around to shake \n     his hand,'' Manos said.\n       ``It goes back to the early days of the company,'' Manos \n     said. ``At Giant, we've always felt like we're a family, and \n     Izzy was the patriarch of the family. People looked forward \n     to seeing him.''\n       In the stores, he greeted employees by their first names--\n     all Giant workers wear name badges--and insisted on being \n     called Izzy. ``Mr. Cohen is my father's name,'' he used to \n     say, refusing to answer to it.\n       Years ago, there was an executive dining room at Giant \n     headquarters, which Cohen closed because he wanted executives \n     to mingle with other employees, Manos said.\n       Cohen had been estranged for many years from his wife, \n     Barbara, when she died in 1994. Their two children were not \n     involved in the business.\n       Cohen avoided social functions, living a quiet life in his \n     parents' old house in the Forest Hills section of Northwest \n     Washington. He was close with his brother Manny, who died \n     several years ago, and his sister Lillian, who lives next \n     door. Together, they founded a charitable foundation and \n     named it for their father. Giant Food also operates a \n     charitable foundation.\n       Izzy Cohen was chauffeured to work nearly every day in his \n     Cadillac. He would visit stores during the week and on \n     weekends. ``You have to have a place to go in the morning,'' \n     he told Washington Post Staff Writer Kara Swisher in 1994.\n       Survivors include his children, Peter Cohen of Altamonte \n     Springs, Fla., and Dana Cohen Ellis of McLean; his sister and \n     two grandchildren.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n               [From the Washington Post, Nov. 24, 1995]\n\nAppreciation Izzy Cohen: Fierce Competitor, Instinctive Retailer, Eager \n                               Innovator\n\n                  (By Frank Swoboda and Kara Swisher)\n\n       Izzy Cohen's closest friends and toughest business \n     competitors say the same thing about him: He was a hell of a \n     grocer.\n       Cohen, the chairman of Giant Food Inc. who died Wednesday \n     at the age of 83, didn't disagree. ``I might not be the best \n     corporate executive,'' Cohen once told his shareholders, \n     ``but I consider myself one of the best grocers in the \n     business.'' That's about as far as he went when it came to \n     public talk about his business philosophy and the strategies \n     he followed to build Giant from one store to 164, with 107 of \n     them in the Washington area where Giant dominates.\n       Cohen never talked much about his personal life, either. \n     Though a multimillionaire, with estimates of his wealth \n     rising as high as $400 million, he led a relatively solitary \n     existence, living in the house in which he grew up, next door \n     to his sister, Lillian Cohen Solomon. He was a rare recluse \n     in a society that has come to lionize wealth and business \n     success.\n       In many ways Cohen was the embodiment of a generation of \n     old-time Washington area entrepreneurs who treated their \n     employees like family and kept their personal lives low-key \n     and private.\n       Even some Giant executives who worked for him for decades \n     knew little about his background. But those who knew him well \n     describe him as a sometimes gruff but generally uncomplicated \n     man, whose unwavering and single-minded devotion was the \n     business he inherited from his father.\n       His ambition also came with a price, however, driving him \n     apart from his wife and children. Although he never divorced, \n     Cohen and his wife had been separated for nearly 40 years at \n     the time of her death two years ago.\n       His sole passions outside of work were bridge and horse \n     racing. He was a master bridge player whose partners included \n     such luminaries of the game as good blood lines but none \n     particularly successful. His stable at Laurel racetrack, with \n     its gold chandeliers and air-conditioned stalls, was a model \n     for the racing industry.\n       Longtime friend and racing companion David Finkelstein \n     tells of going to the track every weekend with Cohen. On the \n     way they would stop at the nearest Giant and buy sandwiches \n     and then take their brown bag lunch to their adjoining boxes. \n     Though Finkelstein also was in food distribution, Cohen never \n     talked business with him on the weekends.\n       The two men also owned apartments at the Jockey Club in \n     Miami, where they would go to watch horse races in the cold \n     winter months. Cohen sometimes bought an entire row of seats \n     at the track so he wouldn't be crowded.\n       On the few occasions when Cohen brought guests to the \n     track, Finkelstein said, he would place a bet on every horse \n     in every race for every guest. At the end of each race, he \n     would then be able to present his guests with a winning \n     ticket.\n       But the real focus of Cohen's life was the grocery \n     business, where he was a fierce competitor and a constant \n     innovator who seized on computer scanning, in-store \n     pharmacies, private-label products, unit pricing, salad bars \n     and other advances to push Giant to the top of the area's \n     grocery business.\n       Before Giant put pharmacies in its supermarkets, the \n     Washington market was dominated by three drugstore chains: \n     Drug Fair, Dart Drug and Peoples. Today, all three are gone \n     and Giant is the dominant player.\n       Before there were automated teller machines, Izzy Cohen \n     tried putting bank branches in his stores. For a brief time \n     he even took Giant into the carwash, dry cleaning, rug and \n     pants cleaning businesses.\n       ``Izzy was the most instinctive guy in terms of food \n     retailing,'' said Jeff Metzger, publisher of Food World, a \n     Columbia-based trade publication. ``He had an uncanny ability \n     to read the right signs, whether it meant putting a store in \n     the right place or adding on another cash register or \n     understanding that consumers came first.''\n       Kenneth Herman, a longtime Cohen competitor whose family \n     started the Lanham-based Shoppers Food Warehouse Corp. chain, \n     agreed.\n       ``He developed one of the finest grocery chains in the \n     country, because of his keen insights about a retail business \n     that is fast-changing,'' Herman said. ``He was truly a \n     merchant's merchant.''\n       Izzy Cohen earned his MBA in the grocery business working \n     behind the counter, starting as a stock clerk and driver for \n     his father. In the years since, he worked in every department \n     at Giant except data processing.\n       Tom McNutt, president of Local 400 of the United Food and \n     Commercial Workers union, which represents Giant employees, \n     tells of being called by Cohen and asked to come right over \n     to the Giant store in Landover, near McNutt's office and \n     Giant's headquarters. When McNutt got to the store, he found \n     Izzy in the produce department--arguing with a store manager \n     and a Giant executive over the proper placement of a display \n     sign. Cohen wanted McNutt's opinion.\n       His decision to seek McNutt's opinion also underscored his \n     close relationships with the unions representing his \n     employees. Some critics have accused Giant of seeking \n     labor peace at any price, and Giant employees are among \n     the best paid in the industry.\n       Over the years, Cohen gained a reputation as a fierce \n     competitor, once telling an interviewer that ``We consider \n     everyone a competitor, including 7 Eleven.'' Shoppers Food \n     Warehouse's Herman remembered Cohen as a ``very tough \n     competitor, but fair.''\n       ``He was a tiger,'' Finkelstein said recalling how Giant \n     drove both Shop Rite and Kroger Co. out of the Washington \n     market in the early 1960s in a series of brutal price wars.\n       Although he was a loner, Cohen did not try to hide from \n     either his employees or his customers. He ate regularly in \n     the company's cafeteria, which featured the same salad bar \n     and deli fare he offered his customers, and personally helped \n     customers during visits to Giant's stores.\n       But Izzy Cohen's life was best summed up by his friend \n     Finkelstein who described him as ``a lonely, frustrated, \n     caring person'' and an ``unbelievable friend.''\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n               [From the Washington Post, Nov. 25, 1995]\n\n                        Editorial--Israel Cohen\n\n       Israel Cohen spent his life building a business that, more \n     than most, directly touches the lives of the people who live \n     in this region. He always spoke of himself as a grocer. As \n     chief strategist and chairman of Giant Food Inc., he was a \n     major force in the transformation of the grocery industry \n     over the past generation.\n       Born in Palestine, Mr. Cohen came to this country as a \n     child and learned the business working in his father's store \n     on Georgia Avenue--one of the first self-service stores in \n     the country. In the years in which he built the Giant chain, \n     the retail market for food charged radically. Customers' \n     demands for diversity of choices expanded enormously, \n     requiring steadily larger stores. The standards of food \n     purity and cleanliness rose rapidly, and the consumer \n     movement became a major force in the country. Grocery \n     retailing has always been highly competitive, and many other \n     chains disappeared as expensive specialty shops cut into the \n     top end of the market while, at the discount end, warehouse \n     stores flourished by offering bulk sales.\n       Mr. Cohen survived and prospered through innovation. He \n     brought drustores into Giant's supermarkets, and they now \n     dominate the retail drug business in this area. He \n     experimented endlessly and successfully with vertical \n     integration, producing some of the goods for his stores' \n     shelves and selling them under private labels to cut costs. \n     He installed salad bars, and his stores were the first in the \n     country to use scanners to speed up the lines at the checkout \n     counters.\n       In a city that loves glitz and notoriety, he chose to live \n     inconspicuously. In a world that encourages highly publicized \n     philanthropy, he usually kept his generosity out of sight. He \n     developed a multibillion dollar company and tried to run it \n     as a family business in which people called each other--\n     including the chairman--by their first names. Long ago he \n     closed the executive dining room at the company's \n     headquarters in Landover because he thought that the people \n     who used it could spend their time better lunching with the \n     other employees.\n       Some kinds of success are useful, and others are not. Mr. \n     Cohen's career was a strong example of the first kind and, \n     more than useful, it was also constructive. Over the years, \n     Izzy Cohen made countless friends. He also made contributions \n     to the community he lived in, and these will survive and \n     continue to do credit to the vital man who died at the age of \n     83 at his home here in Washington on Wednesday.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/12/21/senate-section/article/S19132-1", "month": "12", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "21", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S19133-S19135]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        THE REAL CHINESE THREAT\n\n Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, this past summer's military \nexercises by China \n\n[[Page S19134]]\nnear Taiwan were part of a worrisome trend in East Asia--Chinese \nmilitary expansion. China has been rapidly modernizing its armed \nforces, allegedly transferring missiles to Pakistan, flexing its muscle \nin the South China Sea, and continuing to test nuclear weapons under \nground. Such actions raise concerns for regional stability, and for our \ninterests in promoting economic prosperity and democracy in the region.\n  In the following article from the New York Times Magazine, Nicholas \nKristof points out the growing Chinese power in East Asia and the \nincreasing displays of nationalism. He concludes that United States \npolicy should pay more attention to China's military expansion and the \npotential threats it brings. This seems to me like a good place to \nstart.\n  I ask that the article be printed in the Record.\n  The article follows:\n\n           [From the New York Times Magazine, Aug. 27, 1995]\n\n                        The Real Chinese Threat\n\n                        (By Nicholas D. Kristof)\n\n       Almost no one noticed, but this summer the Pentagon drew a \n     line in the sand. Washington committed itself to using \n     American military force, it necessary, to keep international \n     shipping lanes open in the South China Sea.\n       International, at least, in American eyes. But Beijing's \n     maps put the entire area within China's territorial waters. \n     If a stronger China eventually tries to enforce its national \n     law, which governs shipping in the area, then American forces \n     could be called upon to confront a China that has developed \n     enormously since its troops battled ours to a stalemate in \n     Korea.\n       The underlying problem is the oldest one in diplomacy: how \n     the international community can manage the ambitions of a \n     rising power--and there has never been a rising power quite \n     like China. It has 1.2 billion people; it has a nuclear \n     arsenal; it has an army of 3.2 million, the world's largest; \n     and now it has what may be the world's fastest-growing \n     military budget.\n       For now, China's conventional forces are no match for \n     America's. One of my Chinese friends, the son of a general, \n     attended a meeting in which a group of senior Chinese \n     military officials reviewed films of the American air war \n     against Iraq. ``They sat around the room, moaning about \n     China's lack of preparation, asking what we could possibly do \n     to modernize,'' he reported. ``I felt like piping us and \n     saying there was one thing we could do: go capitalist.''\n       Yet given the rate at which China is pouring money into its \n     armed forces, the situation may eventually be different. The \n     United States Naval War College conducted computer \n     simulations last year and again this year of battles in Asia \n     between China and the United States in the year 2010. To \n     everyone's surprise, China defeated the United States in \n     both. It is said that the Central Intelligence Agency \n     recently conducted its own simulation of such a battle, set \n     in the year 2005, and China won that, too.\n       Simulations don't prove anything. Still, China and Vietnam \n     have both showed, in Korea and Vietnam, how much damage even \n     a backward army can do, particularly when fighting on its own \n     turf. And unlike Vietnam, China has nuclear warheads aimed at \n     the United States. (The United States has stopped targeting \n     China with nuclear missiles, but China has refused to stop \n     targeting America.) China is also believed to be developing \n     biological warfare agents.\n       In Asia, there is now a real fear about what the rise of \n     China will mean. ``The immense presence of China is itself a \n     threat-- whether the Chinese are conscious of it or not--that \n     certainly Japan cannot deal with alone,'' Morihiro Hosokawa, \n     the former Prime Minister, said recently.\n       In the United States, the expression ``containment'' is \n     applied increasingly to China. The Administration's position \n     is that it wants to engage China, rather than contain it, but \n     that if necessary in the future it can switch to a \n     containment policy. ``We're not naive,'' Winston Lord, the \n     Assistant Secretary of State for East Asian and Pacific \n     Affairs, told a congressional committee in June. ``We cannot \n     predict what kind of power China will be in the 21st century. \n     God forbid, we may have to turn with others to a policy of \n     containment. I would hope not.''\n       In the meantime, there is growing alarm in Washington and \n     other capitals at China's military spending and policies. \n     While most countries in the world have been cutting back, \n     China has raised its published military budget by 75 percent \n     since 1988, after adjusting for inflation. And the published \n     budget vastly understates reality. It does not even include \n     weapons procurement. The real figure is probably something \n     like $20 billion, which, when adjusted for purchasing power, \n     may buy as much as $100 billion defense budget in the West.\n       Most disturbing, China is pouring money into those \n     activities that allow it to project power beyond its \n     traditional borders. In particular, it is building a blue-\n     water navy and developing an air-to-air refueling capability. \n     China is also becoming more aggressive in the South China Sea \n     and even in the Indian Ocean--far from its traditional sphere \n     of influence.\n       All of this notwithstanding, it would be a mistake to think \n     that China is somehow a ferocious aggressor. It is not. It \n     shows no interest in seizing areas that it never controlled, \n     like Nepal or Indonesia, and its claims to disputed areas \n     like some islands in the South China Sea do have some merit \n     to them. The risk of conflict arises in part because of \n     stirrings of Chinese nationalism. Nobody believes in \n     Communism anymore, so the Communist Party is trying to use \n     nationalism as the new glue. To some extent, it is working. \n     In five years of living and traveling in China, I met \n     innumerable ordinary people who didn't give two yuan for \n     Communism but who argued passionately that China needed to \n     reclaim its territories.\n       Just a couple of weeks ago, I was chatting with an elderly \n     woman from Shanghai--not a Communist by any means--and I \n     asked her what she thought of Mao. ``You know what his \n     biggest mistake was?'' she asked, and I thought of the Great \n     Leap Forward, which led to the deaths of 30 million people. \n     ``It was giving up Mongolia. That's our land, that's part of \n     China! And he allowed Stalin to take it. What we need to do \n     is get Mongolia back.''\n       I can't say that this woman is representative, although I \n     have occasionally heard other Chinese say they want to \n     recover Mongolia, which is now an independent country. But I \n     have heard many Chinese say that they want their navy to \n     control the entire South China Sea, to seize the Diaoyu \n     Islands from Japan, even to recover Taiwan.\n       Moreover, the likely successor to the present regime in \n     Beijing is not a democracy but a military government. \n     President Jiang Zemin is terrified of a coup d'etat--he has \n     appeared before military units behind a bulletproof shield. \n     If the generals take over in the years following Deng \n     Xiaoping's death, they may be more aggressive than any \n     Communists.\n       The placid waters and palmlined islets of the South China \n     Sea may be the site of Asia's next war. The Government in \n     China refuses to clarify whether it claims the entire South \n     China Sea or just the islands in the sea. But in any case, \n     some of the islands are also claimed by five other countries.\n       China erected a permanent fortress on a reef near the \n     Philippines earlier this year, leading to a tense \n     confrontation at sea between naval vessels for the two sides. \n     Now Americans are training Philippine naval commandos. And \n     Vietnam and China are jostling each other over rival oil \n     exploration programs, by American oil companies, in the \n     disputed area.\n       The worst nightmare in Asia is a Chinese invasion of \n     Taiwan. China regards Taiwan as a renegade province, while \n     many Taiwanese now hope for a country of their own. The \n     authorities in Beijing repeatedly warn that they reserve the \n     right to use force to recover Taiwan. China underlined its \n     threats in July when it conducted missile tests in the open \n     sea 80 miles from Taiwan, forcing the closure of fisheries \n     and the diversion of commercial flights. The Taiwan stock \n     market promptly plunged 6.8 percent amid jitters about a \n     Chinese attack.\n       In any case, the possibility of clashes in the Taiwan \n     Strait may be increasing rather than decreasing. For now, it \n     is not clear that China would win if it attacked Taiwan, but \n     the odds will change as China upgrades its forces. It is \n     impossible to imagine that an island of 20 million could \n     indefinitely defend itself against a country of 1.2 billion.\n       There is, in short, a potential Chinese threat and that \n     drives the question: How should America deal with it?\n       The first step is simply to acknowledge that threat and to \n     pay far more attention to China. America also needs to expand \n     conversations with Chinese leaders, even if that means \n     boosting their legitimacy at times. President Clinton has \n     been reluctant to meet with President Jiang because of \n     Chinese human rights abuses and other problems. But it would \n     be more effective to invite Jiang to Washington and have him \n     listen to hundreds of demonstrators screaming outside his \n     hotel all night. This would convey not only America's \n     willingness to discuss problems but also the seriousness with \n     which Americans take China's misconduct.\n       Washington's aim in such talks should be to promote \n     American interests, and that is not necessarily the same as \n     creating a good relationship with China. There is no reason \n     to provoke a dispute just for the sake of being surly. But \n     the White House has to be willing to risk a dispute when \n     China tests its resolve. For example, China has repeatedly \n     promised not to sell M-11 missiles, which are capable of \n     carrying nuclear warheads, to Pakistan. Each time China makes \n     such a formal pledge, Washington claims credit for a major \n     breakthrough. And each time, China has apparently gone ahead \n     and sold M-11's to Pakistan anyway.\n       These days, the Administration is reluctant to acknowledge \n     what appears to be the latest sale--despite satellite \n     evidence and the best judgments of intelligence analysts--\n     because it is reluctant to worsen relations. The lesson \n     Beijing draws from this is that it can continue violating its \n     pledges as long as it acts greatly offended when someone \n     complains. It would be better to risk a deeper chill in \n     relations than to keep on backing down.\n       America also needs to work with Asian countries to apply \n     joint restraints on China. The Asian group of Southeast Asian \n     countries, for example, has become increasingly effective in \n     pressuring China to go slow in \n\n[[Page S19135]]\n     the South China Sea. And whatever the risks of confrontation, I think \n     the United States was right to declare its willingness to use \n     military force to escort shipping in the South China Sea. If \n     China were to interfere with those shipping lanes--blocking \n     the flow of oil to Japan, for example--the global economy \n     would be thrown into crisis.\n       Americans also need to use the right historical model. \n     China is not bent on international conquest. Beijing may wish \n     to dominate the region, but it does not wish to raise the \n     Chinese flag over Jakarta or Tokyo. Rather, it is like \n     Germany in the run-up to World War I, yearning for greater \n     importance and testing to see what it can get away with. \n     There could be a major war with China, but if so, it will be \n     because of ignorance and miscalculation--in substantial part \n     on the western rim of the Pacific.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/12/21/senate-section/article/S19133-1", "month": "12", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "21", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S19135]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  MEASURE READ FOR FIRST TIME--S. 1500\n\n  Mr. SANTORUM.

The report will be stated.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The committee of conference on the disagreeing votes of the \n     two Houses on the amendment of the Senate to the bill (H.R. \n     1655) to authorize appropriations for fiscal year 1996 for \n     intelligence and intelligence-related activities of the \n     United States Government, the Community Management Account, \n     and the Central Intelligence Agency Retirement and Disability \n     System, and for other purposes, having met, after full and \n     free conference, have agreed to recommend and do recommend to \n     their respective Houses this report, signed by a majority of \n     the conferees.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the Senate will proceed to \nthe consideration of the conference report.\n  (The conference report is printed in the House proceedings of the \nRecord of December 20, 1995.)\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I am pleased today to present to the \nSenate the conference report on the Intelligence Authorization Act for \nfiscal year 1996. This legislation addresses a number of critical \nissues identified through the oversight process and lays the groundwork \nfor legislation the committee plans to introduce early next year to \nensure the intelligence community is organized to effectively address \nthe Nation's critical intelligence needs today and in to the future.\n  Getting this authorization bill to this point in the process has not \nbeen easy, but it would have been impossible were it not for the \nunflagging efforts and cooperation of the vice chairman, Senator Robert \nKerrey. It has been a pleasure working with the Senator from Nebraska \nover the past year and I look forward to a productive year ahead. In \naddition, I want to commend our colleagues on the House Permanent \nSelect Committee on Intelligence, particularly Chairman Larry Combest \nand the ranking minority member, Norman Dicks, for their cooperation \nand willingness to work with us to produce this bill. We had some tough \nissues to address and their good faith and determination to seek areas \nof agreement were critical to the success of our efforts. Finally, I \nwant to recognize the other members of the Senate Select Committee on \nIntelligence, some of whom have served on this committee for quite some \ntime over the years and whose expertise, interest, and insights have \nserved the committee and its chairman well.\n  The conference report and statement of managers you have before you \ntoday contains a number of significant provisions. Several of the \nsections address counterintelligence issues highlighted by the Aldrich \nAmes case. For example, the bill closes a loophole that allowed an \nemployee convicted of espionage to receive money the U.S. Government \ncontributed to his or her thrift savings plan, even though the money \ncontributed to the plan by the employee was forfeited. Similarly, the \nbill allows a spouse who fully cooperates in an espionage investigation \nto receive spousal pension benefits, thus removing a disincentive \nprovided by current law. Perhaps most significant in this regard is the \nprovision that will allow the Federal Bureau of Investigation to obtain \ncertain limited information from credit bureaus as part of a duly \nauthorized counterintelligence or international terrorism \ninvestigation. Following the money trail is a critical part of these \nkinds of investigations. The FBI has the authority under current law to \nlook at bank account information of individuals who are part of such an \ninvestigation. In order to use this authority, however, the FBI must \nidentify the banks at which the individual maintains accounts. This is \noften done today through the intrusive and laborious process of going \nthrough that individual's trash. This provision allows the FBI to get \nthat information, along with basic identifying information, from a \nconsumer credit report if it meets certain specified requirements. \nAccess to the entire consumer credit report still will require a court \norder.\n\n  This conference report also contains a number of provisions that \nreflect the changes wrought by the end of the cold war and the \nreexamination of the role and mission of the intelligence community \n[IC]. One of the key issues in this context is personnel. The committee \nhas been concerned for some time now that the IC has not done an \nadequate job of removing poor performers, creating headroom for those \nwho excel, and ensuring that the community has the right mix of skills \nto accomplish its current and future missions. It is particularly \ncritical that the IC carefully manage the significant downsizing it is \ncurrently experiencing. This report calls on the DCI to develop \npersonnel procedures for the committee to consider that include \nelements for termination based on relative performance and on tie in \nclass.\n  Another trend in the IC in the post-cold-war environment is the \ndeclassification of secrets about which there are no longer national \nsecurity concerns. The conference report contains significantly greater \nflexibility for the DCI and we have been assured that the funds now \nauthorized for this activity are adequate to ensure that \ndeclassification will proceed expeditiously without sacrificing the \ncare needed to weed out the true secrets.\n  The conference report also contains the provision from the Senate \nbill requiring a report on the financial management of the National \nReconnaissance Organization. Like so much of the IC budget--about 85 \npercent, in fact--the NRO budget is under the Department of Defense \nrather than the Director of Central Intelligence. From what we have \nlearned to date about the problems with NRO accounting practices and \nmanagement, this bifurcated chain of authority contributed to a \nsituation in which no one adequately supervised the use, for example, \nof prior year, or carry forward, funds. This committee will continue to \nmonitor NRO's financial management situation until it is satisfied that \ncontrols are in place and there is full accountability.\n  The budget for the IC remains classified, but I can tell you that the \nfunding authorized in the conference report, which incorporates a \nclassified annex, is slightly below last year's level and the \nadministration's request. This is the sixth straight year the budget \nhas been reduced, for a cumulative reduction of 17 percent. The \nconference did recommend a reallocation of funding to emphasize areas \nof critical importance. For example, notwithstanding the rhetorical \npriority placed on critical intelligence topics such as proliferation, \nterrorism, and counternarcotics, the committee identified areas where \ninsufficient funds have been programmed for new capabilities, or where \nactivities are funded in the name of high-priority targets which make \nlittle or no contribution to the issue. In the classified annex \naccompanying the report, \n\n[[Page S19136]]\nthe conferees recommend a number of initiatives to enhance U.S. \ncapabilities in the areas of proliferation, terrorism, and \ncounternarcotics. Similarly, the IC's capabilities for processing \ninformation have lagged behind the collection capabilities and the \nconference report attempts to address that by shifting funds.\n\n  In conclusion, I want to acknowledge the work of the staff of the \ncommittee in putting this legislation together and in assisting the \ncommittee in its day-to-day oversight of this Nation's intelligence \nactivities. I urge my colleagues to support this bill.\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, I join with the chairman in strongly \nrecommending that the Senate adopt this conference report on the fiscal \nyear 1996 Intelligence Authorization Act.\n  This bill continues the efforts of this committee to ensure that the \nintelligence community is making the changes necessary to adapt to \ntoday's world. As our troops enter Bosnia for their peacekeeping \nmission and policymakers work to ensure there continues to be a peace \nto keep, we are reminded once again of the importance of a flexible, \nefficient, and effective intelligence capability to support both \nnational and military needs. It is a very different world from that \nwhich challenged the intelligence community during most of its post \nWorld War II existence. This conference report reflects the changing \nrole and mission of intelligence. To ensure we can meet the growing \ndemand for timely, actionable intelligence, for example, this bill \nshifts greater resources into the processing of intelligence, which has \nfailed to keep pace with the collection of information. Similarly, as \nthe threats from proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, \ninternational terrorism, organized crime, and international narcotics \ntrafficking take on ever greater importance, the committee has included \nbudgetary recommendations to increase funding in these areas.\n  The conference report includes all of the provisions contained in the \nSenate bill, although several of the provisions reflect some changes. \nIn addition, the conference report includes a provision specifying that \nthe Director of Central Intelligence can use up to $25 million for \ndeclassifying records over 25 years old, pursuant to a recent Executive \norder. The House bill had imposed a much tighter limit on the \navailability of funds for this purpose. The conferees agreed to a \nrevised provision that will allow the DCI to begin this process in a \nmanner that is more likely to produce timely results without \ncompromising national security.\n  This year has seen great controversy concerning the intelligence \ncommunity. Some of the problems we are all familiar with include the \nCIA's relationship with assets in Guatemala who may have participated \nin or covered up murders, the continuing damage caused by Aldrich Ames' \ntreachery, CIA's withholding from its customers the full details of \nsource information on Soviet and Russian reports, and the National \nReconnaissance office's accumulation of funds in forward funding \naccounts vastly in excess of what they require. These failures and \nmistakes remind us all of the need for vigilant oversight of \nintelligence activities, a responsibility which Chairman Specter and I \nand our colleagues on the committee take very seriously.\n  These controversies also remind us that intelligence is becoming less \nof a secret business; there is a conscious process of declassification \nnow ongoing, which is healthy; the actions of our Government should be \nas transparent as possible, consistent with protecting the lives of the \nNation and our people. But there is also a tendency to attack necessary \nsecrecy by means of leaks as if, with the demise of the Soviet Union, \nthe need to protect sources and methods has evaporated and the leaking \nand publication of classified information is therefore harmless. Mr. \nPresident, terrorism, the spread of nuclear and chemical weapons in the \nworld, the Russian and Chinese nuclear forces, international crime and \ndrug trafficking, the intentions of factions in Bosnia to attack our \ntroops--these are not harmless threats, and it is most harmful to \nreveal the American intelligence sources and techniques employed \nagainst those threats. In our oversight tasks we walk a fine line \nbetween correcting problems and deficiencies and telling the public as \nmuch as we can about the, on the one hand, and protecting necessary \nsecrets, on the other.\n  This has been a challenging year for the intelligence community. In \nthe midst of significant downsizing, questions about its mission, and \nwhat seemed at times to be daily revelations of scandals, the \nintelligence professionals continued to collect, analyze, and \ndisseminate information to meet the needs of policymakers and the \nmilitary. All of us can take pride in the quality and dedication of the \nAmericans serving their country in the intelligence community, and I \nhope the headlines of the moment will not dissuade dedicated, talented \nyoung patriots from seeking careers in intelligence. In the coming \nmonths the committee will be making decisions about legislation to \nensure that the intelligence community is structured to maximize the \neffectiveness of the efforts of these hard working men and women. The \nbill before you today is a significant step in that direction and I \nurge your support.\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Mr. President, I want to take a moment prior to Senate \nenactment of the conference report to H.R. 1655, the Intelligence \nAuthorization bill to express my views regarding several provisions \nthat I fear could weaken U.S. sanctions laws and weapons non-\nproliferation policy.\n  The proliferation of weapons of mass destruction is the leading \nsecurity issue facing the United States and its allies. The President \nhimself said so in a speech last year. There is a direct connection \nbetween the imposition of sanctions under U.S. and international laws \nand the volume of weapons trafficking. Strong enforcement of sanctions \nlaws is a critical element of U.S. and international non-proliferation \npolicy. The likelihood of punishment must be high. The commitment of \nour nation as the principle leader in international non-proliferation \nefforts must be taken seriously. Our resolve must be unquestioned. To \ndo otherwise would send the worst signal, particularly to terrorist \nstates and rogue groups. In that kind of environment, the very security \nof the United States may be in question.\n  It is for that reason that I must express my concerns with H.R. 1655, \nand more to the point, section 303 of the bill, which would create a \nnew Title IX in the National Security Act. This new title would give \nthe President unprecedented authority to stay the imposition of \nsanctions related to the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, \ntheir delivery systems, as well as other advanced conventional, \nchemical or biological weapons. This waiver authority could be \nexercised if the President determines that the imposition of sanctions \n``would seriously risk the compromise of an ongoing criminal \ninvestigation directly related to the activities giving rise to the \nsanction or an intelligence source or method directly related to the \nactivities giving rise to the sanction.''\n  I am very concerned that with this provision, diplomatic and \npolitical pressure may make it impossible for the United States to do \nthe right thing and sanction major offenders.\n  For the last several years, the proliferation of weapons of mass \ndestruction and the delivery systems of such weapons appears to be \nintensifying. All this year, we have heard reports that the People's \nRepublic of China has engaged in the proliferation of ballistic missile \nsystems to Pakistan and possibly even Iran--activities that would be \nsanctionable under the Missile Technology Control Regime, MTCR. China \nalso is reported to be actively involved in the expansion of Pakistan's \nnuclear program, as well as Iran's drive for nuclear technology.\n  The fact that all of this reported activity can occur without as much \nas a threat of sanctions from the United States has led me to believe \nthat we may need to make our sanctions laws tougher. In fact, I am the \nauthor of a law that gives the President presumptive authority to \nimpose sanctions against parties that export questionable materials to \nterrorist countries. This law, which went into effect last year, was \ndesigned to give the President the ability to impose sanctions in cases \nwhere he simply had reason to believe that weapons of mass destruction \nor their means of delivery had fallen in the hands of terrorist \ncountries. He need not wait for actual proof. If he \n\n[[Page S19137]]\nwaited, it may be too late. Equally important, the law compels the \nsanctioned country to come forward to demonstrate that no violation \nactually took place.\n  This law, in short, broadens the President's authority to enforce \nnon-proliferation policy. The conference report to H.R. 1655 goes in \nthe opposite direction--it broadens the President's authority to weaken \nnon-proliferation policy.\n  Mr. President, I recognize that the trafficking of weapons of mass \ndestruction and their related delivery systems takes place out of \nsight. I also very much respect that fact that intelligence sources and \nmethods designed to monitor a nation's weapons activities are almost \nalways, if not entirely, at risk of discovery. The consequences of such \ndiscovery certainly are life-threatening to say the least. Virtually \nall prosecutions and sanctions are developed from intelligence sources \nand methods. Therefore, I am very concerned that the conference report \nwould provide the President with a very tempting waiver option--an \noption that would give the President the opportunity to make a \npolitical decision to forego prosecution or to avoid imposition of \nsanctions, but base it on ``sources and methods.'' In other words, the \nPresident would have the opportunity to place political expediency or \nother factors above our nation's non-proliferation laws. I believe that \nkind of discretion is a serious mistake.\n  I raised these concerns to the distinguished Chairman of the \nIntelligence Committee, Senator Specter. I know a number of my \ncolleagues in the House and the Senate expressed similar views. Both \nthe final bill language and the joint explanatory statement of the \nconference committee attempt to address these concerns. First, the \nconferees required that Title IX would be in effect for just one year. \nThis limitation was placed to afford the Congress the opportunity to \nmonitor closely the use of this new authority. Second, the conferees \nmake clear that this authority is to be used for its stated purpose--to \npreserve sources and methods, as well as ongoing criminal \ninvestigations when seriously at risk--and ``not as a pretext for some \nother reason not to impose sanctions such as economic or foreign policy \nreasons.''\n  I appreciate the effort made by the conferees to restrict the \nPresident's ability to exercise this waiver authority to the purposes \nstated in the legislation. I also appreciate the conferees' insistence \nthat this provision only be in effect for one year. Despite these \nefforts, I still believe we are setting a dangerous precedent and \nopening a Pandora's box that could be difficult to close.\n  Consider two facts: first, intelligence sources and methods are \nvirtually the only means that allow a President to proceed with \nsanctions; and second, only the President is in the best position to \ndetermine whether or not a source or method is at risk if sanctions are \nimposed.\n  These facts lead this senator to conclude that the new Title IX is \nbased on a flawed premise--that Congress has the ability to ensure that \nthe President will not abuse this new discretionary authority to waive \nsanctions. I say it is flawed because only the President is in a \nposition to determine whether or not a source or method is at risk. \nThis risk determination is subjective--a judgement call. And, again, \ngiven that the basis for sanctions comes from sources and methods, the \nPresident is given the latitude to consider numerous economic, \npolitical or foreign policy implications, but on paper base his \nconclusion on sources and methods. What methods and resources do we in \nCongress have to second guess the President should he make a ``sources \nand methods'' risk determination? Would the Congress even want to \nsecond guess the President, given the fact that doing so could be even \nmore dangerous to that intelligence source or method?\n  The fact is our sources and methods are almost always at risk, to say \nthe least, but until today, our priority always has been the \nenforcement of our non-proliferation laws.\n  I am hopeful that in the next year, Congress will closely monitor the \nPresident's use of this waiver authority. I urge my colleagues not just \nto consider the President's ability to comply with the conditions set \nby the conferees, but also our own ability to ensure that these \nconditions are in fact followed by the President.\n  As the world's sole superpower, all nations concerned with the threat \nof nuclear proliferation look to the United States to lead by example. \nVigorous U.S. enforcement of nuclear non-proliferation laws and \nagreements is crucial to the security of all people. I am very \nconcerned that the conference report sets a bad precedent that could \nundermine vigorous enforcement in the year ahead, and even beyond if \nCongress allows the law to continue. I intend to follow this matter \nvery closely in the year ahead. It is my hope that tough, consistent \nenforcement of our non-proliferation laws will not be sacrificed.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nconference report be deemed agreed to; that the motion to reconsider be \nlaid on the table; and that a statement on behalf of Senator Specter be \nplaced at the appropriate place in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  So the conference was deemed agreed to.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/12/21/senate-section/article/S19135-2", "month": "12", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "21", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S19137-S19138]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            COMMENDING THE CIA'S STATUTORY INSPECTOR GENERAL\n\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to the \nimmediate consideration of Senate Resolution 201 submitted earlier \ntoday by Senator Specter and Senator Kerrey.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       A resolution (S. Res. 201) commending the CIA's statutory \n     Inspector General on his 5-year anniversary in office.\n\n  The Senate proceeded to consider the resolution.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, it is with great pleasure that I join my \nformer colleagues on the Senate Intelligence Committee in co-sponsoring \na resolution commending the fine work of the CIA's Inspector General, \nFred Hitz, and congratulating Fred on his 5-year anniversary as the \nfirst Senate-confirmed Inspector General at the CIA. I had the honor of \nworking with Fred's father many years ago, and I would like to say that \nFred is admirably carrying on his family's very fine tradition of \npublic service.\n  During the majority of my tenure on the Intelligence Committee and, \nin particular, during my service as Vice Chairman of the Committee from \n1993 until January of this year, I enjoyed the benefit of Fred Hitz's \nwise counsel. Fred's integrity, objectivity, and fine investigative \nskills have served the CIA well as the Agency has confronted a number \nof serious problems in recent years.\n  Of special note, the Inspector General's comprehensive investigation \nof the Aldrich Ames spy case provided the Intelligence Committee, and \nindeed, the Nation, with the details of Ames 9-years of treachery, and \ninsight into the problems at the CIA which allowed Ames' activities to \ngo undetected for so long. The Committee relied heavily on the fine \nwork performed by Fred Hitz's office in making its recommendations for \nhow to correct the problems which the Ames case brought to light. \nHopefully, the combined efforts of the CIA's IG and the Senate \nIntelligence Committee will serve to severely lessen the likelihood \nthat this nation will be faced with another Ames case in the future.\n  Under Fred Hitz's leadership, the CIA's Inspector General's office \nhas become an effective, objective and independent institution upon \nwhich the Members of Congress have come to rely.\n  I congratulate Fred on reaching this milestone in his illustrious \ncareer, and I look forward to many more years of working together on \nintelligence issues which are so vital to the national security of the \nUnited States.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I rise to introduce a resolution on \nbehalf of myself, Senator Kerrey of Nebraska, Senator Glenn, Senator \nBryan, Senator Robb, Senator Johnston, Senator Chafee, Senator Baucus, \nSenator Warner, Senator Kerry of Massachusetts, Senator Shelby, Senator \nGraham of Florida, Senator Kyl, Senator Lugar, Senator Inhofe, Senator \nByrd, and Senator DeWine commending the Central Intelligence Agency's \nstatutory Inspector General on his 5-year anniversary in office.\n\n[[Page S19138]]\n\n  Mr. President, the CIA's statutory inspector general is an issue that \nis near and dear to me, particularly since it was at my initiative that \nthis office was established. I, along with a good number of my Senate \ncolleagues who served both on the Iran-Contra Committee and the Senate \nSelect Committee on Intelligence, had voiced concern with the need for \nobjectivity, authority, and independence on the part of the CIA's \nOffice of Inspector General. And, working in close collaboration with \nmy colleague Senator Glenn, we crafted a provision that in 1989 was \nincluded in the Intelligence Authorization Act of fiscal year 1990--\nsubsequently enacted into law--to establish an independent, \nPresidentially appointed statutory inspector general at the CIA. In \nNovember, 1990, the Honorable Frederick P. Hitz was formally sworn in \nas the CIA's first statutory inspector general.\n  As chairman of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, I am \npleased to report to my colleagues that in the 5 years since Fred Hitz \nwas sworn in as the CIA IG, the committee has noted a vast improvement \nin the effectiveness and objectivity of that office. This has been due \nin no small measure to the capable leadership of Fred Hitz. While the \ncommittee has not always agreed with the judgments of the CIA inspector \ngeneral's office, the CIA IG has been fearless in taking on difficult \nand controversial issues such as BCCI, BNL, the Aldrich Ames case, and \nCIA activities in Guatemala--just to name a few. And the work of Fred \nHitz's shop has been an invaluable supplement to our committee's \nintelligence oversight role.\n  Mr. President, there was fierce resistance to the creation of a \nstatutory inspector general at the Central Intelligence Agency, and \nthere continues to be strong resentment of an independent IG in certain \nquarters of the CIA to this day.\n  This should come as no surprise. It is hard to think of another \nFederal agency in the U.S. Government more institutionally resistant to \nhaving an independent inspector general than the CIA. Accordingly, I \nbelieve that any CIA IG worth his or her salt would be about as popular \nas Fred Hitz currently is with some of his present and former CIA \ncolleagues. It is a mark of his tenacity and integrity that Fred and \nhis office continue to tackle the IG's mission of serving as an \nindependent fact-finder and, when necessary, a critic of CIA programs \nand operations.\n  Mr. President, the statutory CIA inspector general has made the \nCentral Intelligence Agency more accountable to the American people. I \nand my Senate colleagues wish to acknowledge and commend the fine work \nof this office, and congratulate Fred Hitz on his 5-year anniversary as \nthe first statutory CIA inspector general.\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, I rise to join my distinguished chairman, \nSenator Specter, in introducing this resolution to acknowledge the \nimportant role of the Central Intelligence Agency's statutory inspector \ngeneral's office and noting the excellent work of Fred Hitz--the first \nCIA statutory IG who has recently celebrated his 5-year anniversary in \nthis challenging position.\n  There was, to say the least, some skepticism about the wisdom of \ncreating the statutory IG office at the CIA. Indeed, no one should be \nsurprised that there was little support in the Agency for the creation \nof a statutory inspector general office. But fortunately, Senator \nSpecter and Senator Glenn and others convinced the Senate to support \nthis idea, and the office was created. Yet even after enactment, there \nwas still resistance to an independent fact-finder within the Agency, \nand some of its persists even today.\n  The CIA has a proud but insular culture which tends to resist the \nscrutiny of an independent examiner. Also, because CIA operates in \nsecret and undertakes--at the request and direction of policymakers--\nactivities which the United States must deny, the additional oversight \nof an independent IG is essential. To perform this oversight \neffectively and honestly means to occasionally render strong criticism. \nThose who are criticized are sometimes offended. Their response to \ncriticism ranges from the stoic silence we associate with CIA, to both \nattributable and anonymous counter-criticism of Mr. Hitz.\n  Mr. President, criticism of the IG by past and present CIA employees \nsuggests to me that Mr. Hitz has been doing his job in the spirit \nCongress intended. I do not claim, nor would Mr. Hitz claim, that he \nhas done his job perfectly. Few of us attain such a level of \nperformance. I and some other members of the Intelligence Committee \nhave not always agreed with his conclusions in particular \ninvestigations. But I would claim the CIA is a stronger, more effective \norganization today because he has been a strong, independent IG, as \nCongress envisioned.\n  Congress' own oversight of intelligence activities would be much more \ndifficult without the insights provided by an independent IG. At the \nsame time, an independent IG must not contribute to a climate in which \nCIA is afraid to take risks when vital U.S. interests are at stake. An \nindependent IG must not create an internal empire of inspectors which \nhas the same chilling effect on creative action in Government that \nexcessive regulation has on business. Like the congressional oversight \ncommittees, a good IG must ensure that the Agency acts in accordance \nwith U.S. law and U.S. values without inhibiting the Agency's ability \nto act boldly.\n  From what I see from the vantage point of the Intelligence Committee, \nFred Hitz has been that kind of IG. I congratulate him on his \ncompletion of 5 years of service and I congratulate my colleagues who 5 \nyears ago envisioned what we now agree is a very necessary job.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I ask unanimous consent that the resolution be agreed \nto, the preamble be agreed to, the motion to reconsider be laid upon \nthe table and any statements be placed in the appropriate place in the \nRecord.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The resolution (S. Res. 201) was agreed to.\n  The preamble was agreed to.\n  The resolution, with its preamble, reads as follows:\n\n                              S. Res. 201\n\n       Whereas, because of its concern with the need for \n     objectivity, authority and independence on the part of the \n     Central Intelligence Agency's Office of Inspector General, \n     the Senate in 1989 included in the Intelligence Authorization \n     Act of Fiscal Year 1990--subsequently enacted into law--a \n     provision establishing an independent, Presidentially-\n     appointed statutory Inspector General at the CIA;\n       Whereas in November, 1990, The Honorable Frederick P. Hitz \n     was formally sworn in as the CIA's first statutory Inspector \n     General;\n       Whereas the CIA's statutory Office of Inspector General, \n     under the capable leadership of Frederick P. Hitz, has \n     demonstrated its independence, tenacity, effectiveness and \n     integrity; and\n       Whereas the work of the CIA Office of Inspector General \n     under Mr. Hitz's leadership has contributed notably to the \n     greater efficiency, effectiveness, integrity and \n     accountability of the Central Intelligence Agency: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate expresses its congratulations to \n     Frederick P.

I ask unanimous consent that the reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The text of the amendment is printed in today's Record under \n``Amendments Submitted.'')\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I rise in support of H.R. 2029, the Farm \nCredit System Reform Act of 1996. The bill makes changes to the \nauthorizing legislation for the Federal Agricultural Mortgage \nCorporation [Farmer Mac] to afford it a final opportunity to establish \na successful secondary market for agricultural loans. Its future is \nseriously threatened and without this corrective legislation, the \nbenefits it offers farmers, ranchers, and rural homeowners may be lost. \nFarmer Mac was established to encourage a stable and highly competitive \nlending environment for rural America, an environment that must be \npreserved.\n  The bill also provides changes to the underlying statute for the \ncooperative Farm Credit System [FCS] to provide relief from outdated \nand unnecessary regulations. These changes will give FCS more \nflexibility in its operations and allow it to provide competitive loan \nrates and improved service. The bill also extends the U.S. Department \nof Agriculture's interest rate reduction production on guaranteed farm \nloans. This program is an important tool used to transfer direct loan \nborrowers to guaranteed loans, eventually leading to borrower \ngraduation from Federal support. Finally, the bill will authorize a new \nfoundation to facilitate creative solutions to soil and water \nconservation problems. This foundation will be funded primarily through \nprivate donations.\n  Farmer Mac is responsible for providing farmers, ranchers, and rural \nhomeowners with access to a stable and competitive supply of credit for \nmortgage loans. It is a privately owned and operated corporation \ncreated by Congress in 1988. Farmer Mac is known as a Government \nsponsored enterprise, similar to Sallie Mae and Fannie Mae, which \nemploy private capital to establish business operations charged with \nspecific responsibilities to carry out public policy. Farmer Mac, which \nbegan operations after the enactment of the Agricultural Credit Act of \n1987, raised $21 million in private capital from banks, insurance \ncompanies, and Farm Credit institutions to fund the development and \noperation of a secondary market. No Federal funds were invested in the \noriginal capitalization of Farmer Mac and no Federal funds have ever \nbeen appropriated to support any facet of its operation. In fact, \nFarmer Mac pays the Farm Credit Administration annual assessments to \ncover the cost to the Government of regulating the secondary market.\n  Farmer Mac must make a profit to support its operations or its \ncapital base will eventually be exhausted. Should the capital base \nerode--it is currently down to about $11 million--the original \ninvestors would lose their investments and the secondary market would \nterminate. Termination of Farmer Mac would deny rural Americans access \nto competitive long-term fixed rate mortgages at a time when budget \nreductions and changes in Government housing and agricultural policy \nwill place increased pressure on farmers, ranchers, and rural \nhomeowners to reduce expenses to remain competitive.\n  The successful Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac residential mortgage \nsecondary markets were used as the structural design for Farmer Mac. \nHowever, certain distinctions were made that have become obstacles to \nFarmer Mac's success: First, the requirement that Farmer Mac operate \nits program through poolers, and Second, the requirement that every \nFarmer Mac loan be backed by a minimum 10-percent subordinated \nparticipation interest. The bill repeals both of these obstacles. Nine \npoolers have been certified since 1990. However, the poolers have only \nsubmitted six pools of qualified loans, totaling $790 million, for \nguarantee under the program. The limited participation has prevented \nthe program from generating enough income to support its cost of \noperation. Under H.R. 2029, Farmer Mac will now be permitted to \npurchase and pool loans itself, and the 10-percent cash reserve \nrequirement is eliminated. The removal of these impediments will make \nFarmer Mac's structure essentially identical to other successful GSE's.\n  In addition, the legislation: extends the time period before the Farm \nCredit Administration may promulgate risk-based capital regulations to \n3 years after the date of enactment; provides a time triggered \ntransition period to increased minimum and critical capital \nrequirements; requires Farmer Mac to increase its core capital to at \nleast $25 million within 2 years or curtail its operation; and provides \nprocedures for the Farm Credit Administration to liquidate Farmer Mac's \noperation in the event it fails to establish a successful secondary \nmarket.\n  It has become apparent that after almost 6 years of operation, Farmer \nMac's statutory structure will not work. This important piece of \nlegislation gives Farmer Mac everything it needs to succeed for the \nsake of rural Americans.\n  The bill also removes undue regulatory burden placed on the Farm \nCredit System and provides the System greater flexibility in its \noperations to offer its borrowers competitive loan rates and improved \nservice.\n  This portion of the legislation provides that FCS borrower stock and \nborrower rights requirements do not apply for 180 days to loans \ndesignated for sale to the secondary market; allows FCS associations to \nform administrative entities; provides for rebating to System banks \nexcess amounts in the Farm Credit System Insurance Fund after 8 years \nof interest earnings accumulate on top of the System's secure capital \nbase; provides procedures for allocating to System banks and to other \ninstitutions holding Financial Assistance Corporation [FAC] stock \nexcess amounts in the Farm Credit System Insurance Fund until $56 \nmillion is repaid; provides authority to prohibit or limit golden \nparachute payments to System executives; and repeals the requirement \nfor establishing a new board of directors for the Farm Credit System \nInsurance Corporation and retains the current board structure.\n  The FAC stock provisions lay to rest a long standing controversy in \nthe Farm Credit System. Beginning in 1984, the System came upon hard \ntimes due to the credit crisis in farming and System associations were \nrequired to purchase FAC stock for the amount of unallocated retained \nearnings exceeding 13 percent of their total assets to assist in \nrescuing the floundering system. The associations which had a high \nlevel of capital in relation to their loan volume were affected most. \nMany associations believe that they and their borrowers were required \nby the Agricultural Credit Act of 1987 to carry a disproportionate \nshare of the System's self-help burden. The substantial depletion of \ncapital resulting from the assessment caused associations to increase \ninterest rates to their customers. The assessment was challenged by 21 \nproduction credit associations shortly after the enactment of the 1987 \nlegislation. However, the U.S. Court of Appeals affirmed the authority \nof Congress to impose the assessment in June 1992. Legislation in 1988 \nand 1989 permitted the return of $121 million to the FAC stockholders \nof the more than $177 million collected from System institutions.\n  Many in Congress believe that the assessments and mandatory purchase \nof FAC stock represented a commitment to the future of the Farm Credit \nSystem. It was the inherent responsibility of System institutions to \njoin the Federal Government to bail out the System in exchange for \ncontinued agency status for their debt securities. The compromise \nincluded in this bill permits the repayment of $56 million to the \nremaining FAC stockholders and terminates the Financial Assistance \nCorporation trust upon full repayment of that sum. I support this \ncompromise and I am pleased that this controversy has been amicably \nresolved.\n  Preserving and making more efficient a system that provides rural \nAmerica access to stable and competitive credit is of the utmost \nimportance. Farmer Mac can make an important \n\n[[Page S19140]]\ncontribution to this goal. This legislation is a final congressional \neffort to make Farmer Mac viable. Legislative restrictions may have \nhobbled the institution until now. If the new authorities do not prove \nsufficient, it will be time to declare Farmer Mac a failed experiment. \nThe bill before us provides for orderly procedures in this event.\n\n  I urge my colleagues to support this important piece of legislation.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I rise at this time to engage the gentleman from Indiana, \nthe chairman of the committee, in a colloquy.\n  Mr. LUGAR. I would be pleased to engage the Senator in a colloquy.\n  Mr. LEAHY. It is my understanding that the legislation before us \ntoday includes provisions designed to provide relief to institutions of \nthe Farm Credit System from the paperwork, costs, and other burdens \nassociated with unnecessary and archaic regulatory requirements placed \non such institutions under current law. It is also my understanding \nthat similar legislation to provide regulatory relief to the commercial \nbanking industry is also under consideration by the Congress.\n  Mr. LUGAR. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. LEAHY. It is also my understanding that the legislation before \nthe Senate includes amendments to title VIII of the Farm Credit Act of \n1971 to modernize, expand, and make other improvements in the Federal \ncharter and authorities of the Federal Agricultural Mortgage \nCorporation so that this entity, commonly known as Farmer Mac, can \nbetter provide credit to agricultural borrowers through commercial \nbanks and other lenders.\n  Mr. LUGAR. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. LEAHY. It is my further understanding that this legislation \nincludes an agreed-upon compromise to address once and for all the \nissue of the return of the remaining 32 percent of the one-time self-\nhelp contributions paid by Farm Credit Systems banks and associations \nto help capitalize the Financial Assistance Corporation. The \ninstitutions that were assessed these contributions were designated as \nholders of stock in the Financial Assistance Corporation, commonly \nreferred to as FAC stock. Is it not true that this stock, in and of \nitself, has no value, and that the holders of this stock have no legal \nclaim, either now or in future, against any party in association with \nthis stock, beyond any that may arise as a result of the specific \nprovisions of the bill before us today?\n  Mr. LUGAR. The Senator's understanding is absolutely correct.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I am disappointed that the bill before us today does not \ninclude amendments to the remaining titles of the Farm Credit Act of \n1971 to provide similar modernization, expansion, and improvements to \nthe Federal charter and other authorities of the remaining institutions \nof the Farm Credit System. These banks and associations of the Farm \nCredit System provide a needed source of credit to the farmers, \nranchers, their associations, and cooperatives across rural America. \nThe System also provides financing for agricultural exports, rural \nwater and waste, and other rural enterprises. Does the chairman have \nany plans to comprehensively review the authorities of these other \ninstitutions regulated under the Farm Credit Act of 1971 with an eye \ntoward providing for the similar modernization, expansion and \nimprovement of their Federal charter and other authorities?\n  Mr. LUGAR. Yes, it is my intention next year to work with the \ngentleman from Vermont and other interested Members to conduct a \ncomprehensive review by the Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and \nForestry of the authorities of the institutions regulated under the \nFarm Credit Act of 1971, other than Farmer Mac, consistent with the \njurisdiction of the committee. The stated goal of this review will be \nto develop legislation to provide for the modernization, expansion, and \nimprovement of their Federal charter and other authorities of the \ninstitutions of the Farm Credit System. Such legislation, if warranted \nby our review, could provide for enhanced agricultural, business, and \nrural development financing across the United States.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I thank the Senator for his cooperation on the bill before \nus today and look forward to working with him next year on the \nimportant Farm Credit System modernization legislation he has just \ndescribed.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \namendment be agreed to and the bill be deemed read a third time and \npassed, and the motion to reconsider be laid upon the table.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  So the amendment (No. 3109) was agreed to.\n  So the bill (H.R. 2029) was deemed read the third time and passed.\n  So the title was amended so as to read: An Act to amend the Farm \nCredit Act of 1971 to provide regulatory relief, and for other \npurposes.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/12/21/senate-section/article/S19138-2", "month": "12", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "21", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S19140]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n        MEASURE READ THE FIRST TIME--HOUSE JOINT RESOLUTION 134\n\n  Mr. SANTORUM.

Mr. President, again I want to restate my admiration \nfor the Senator from Delaware and for the members of the Finance \nCommittee staff for their tremendous work in this legislation and for \nhastily preparing Members for this debate this evening that was not \nexpected until tomorrow.\n  I want to also thank Senator Chafee, who really worked diligently \nduring the conference between the House and the Senate on behalf of \npoints that the \n\n[[Page S19141]]\nSenate stood very strongly in support of--things like the maintenance \nof efforts provision, which there was a lot of concern on both sides of \nthe aisle, and child care funding and the SSI provisions. Those three \npoints could have, I think, caused significant problems had we not held \nvery closely to what the Senate provisions were, and I think we have \ndone that in all three cases. I think Senator Chafee should be \ncommended for his work.\n  I also want to congratulate Senator Domenici for not just his work on \nthe welfare reform bill, but in all the conferences that he had to deal \nwith and his action on the welfare issue when Senator Chafee helped the \nresolution of the bill move toward the Senate bill. That is probably \none of the most important things I wanted to stress about this bill.\n  It may sound like you are lauding yourself here, but in a sense the \nSenate did a very good job of arguing for its positions in the welfare \nconference. I think most folks who look at this from the outside will \nsee that, of the two bills that went in, the one bill that came out \nlooks a heck of a lot more like the Senate bill than it does the House \nbill. I think that is a wise course to take.\n  The Senate bill is a more moderate bill, but it is still a very \ndramatic reform and one that I think will set this country on a proper \ncourse of putting the ladder back down, all the way down, to allow even \nthose at the lower social strata of our country today and income strata \nof our country today, to climb that ladder up to opportunity and \nsuccess and change the entire dynamics of welfare from one that is \nlooked upon by those now who are in the system and who pay for the \nsystem disparagingly.\n  Welfare is not a word, when it is uttered, that is given any kind of \nrespect. Nobody says the word ``welfare'' and thinks, ``Wow, what a \ngreat system.'' Or, ``Gee, this is something that is really necessary, \nthat works.''\n  That is sad. It is sad for the people who have to pay the taxes to \nfinance it. It is also sad for the people who find themselves caught in \nit, to be stigmatized by this system that has failed. It may not have \nfailed them particularly. In fact, many people have gotten onto the \nwelfare rolls and come off stronger and better. But those cases happen \nnot as often as we would like to see. We would like to see the changing \nof the stigma of welfare to a program that, when you look at it, you \ncan be proud of it. When you see your dollars invested in it, you see \ndollars invested in a system that truly does help people and that is \nmarked with more successes than failures.\n  While there have been successes, they simply do not match up. I think \nwe can look at the overall decline in our poor communities as evidence \nof that.\n  I want to debunk a couple of myths here to begin with, and then go \ninto the specifics of the legislation, because as I said before, the \npoint I wanted to make here, more than anything else, is if you were \nsomeone who voted for H.R. 4 when it passed the Senate, you have to do \na pretty good stretch to vote against this conference report. You have \nto think up a lot of reasons that, frankly, do not exist to vote \nagainst this conference report. Because the bills are very similar and, \nin fact, there were things adopted in the conference report that even \nmoved more toward the Democratic side of the aisle than were in the \noriginal Senate-passed bill.\n  That is why I am somewhat at a loss and I am hopeful--I should not \nsay that. I am not hopeful. I would like to think that the President, \nwhen he takes a second look at this legislation in its entirety and \nmatches it up with H.R. 4 that passed the Senate, which he said he \nwould sign, that again he would have a big stretch to find some fatal \nflaw in the conference report that did not exist in the bill that he \nsaid he would sign.\n  Let me debunk a couple of myths. No. 1, that we are cutting welfare. \nWe are not cutting welfare. This is the same idea that is being \nperpetrated on the American public with ``We are cutting Medicare.'' We \nare not cutting Medicare, Medicare increases over 7 percent a year for \n7 years. It is a mantra that comes out. I do not even think about it. \nIt spews forward because we are constantly defending the ``cuts in \nMedicare.'' We will be charged with cutting welfare, leaving people \nhomeless and not providing support.\n\n  I refer my colleagues to this chart, which shows that welfare \nspending from 1996 to the year 2000 will go up under current law at 56 \npercent, that is 5.8 percent per year. That is almost three times the \nrate of inflation. Under the Republican bill, this bill that some will \nlabel draconian and mean-spirited and not caring about children and all \nthe way--it goes up 34 percent over the next 7 years, or 4 percent a \nyear, almost twice the rate of inflation.\n  So you do not think that the increase is based on an increase in the \namount of people going on welfare programs, you will see that the per \ncapita increase in welfare spending--what we are spending on what is \nestimated to be the welfare population --also goes up over the next \nseveral years and continues to go up. That is in spite of the fact that \nwe have a very sharp disagreement between the Congressional Budget \nOffice, whose numbers this is based upon, and the Department of Health \nand Human Services, as to what the welfare caseload will be over the \nnext several years.\n  These numbers are based on the Congressional Budget Office, which \nsuggests that the welfare caseload will, in fact, remain constant over \nthe next 7 years. Even though with changes in SSI, with other changes \nin AFDC, with the block-granting, with the work requirements, we have \nseen a dramatic drop in States that have implemented these kinds of \nwork requirements--Wisconsin and Michigan, for example--in welfare \ncaseload. CBO does not account for that. They say it is going to be \nconstant.\n  The Department of Health and Human Services, by the way, suggests \nthat the welfare caseload over the next 7 years will drop by 50 \npercent. This is getting ridiculed for one thing but getting scored for \nthe other. You get ridiculed by the White House for cutting welfare \nrolls by 50 percent over the next 7 years and therefore cutting off \nchildren and women and all these things, yet for the purposes of \ndetermining how much money you are spending per child the Congressional \nBudget Office says that welfare caseload is going to remain constant. \nSo you lose on both ends in this situation, which is unfortunate for \nthis debate.\n  But I think it points out that there is certainly room to believe \nthat welfare caseload will go down, and with the programs that we have \nin place, the block granted programs with finite dollars, that the \nspending per family will actually increase more than this, that there \nwill be more money for States to do the things that those on the other \nside, who oppose this bill, want--because there are many who voted for \nthe original Senate bill who say there is not enough money for child \ncare or there is not enough money for work.\n  As I suggested to the Senator from Massachusetts, we are not cutting \nchild care in this bill. We are increasing child care above what is in \ncurrent law, as we should. We are requiring work, which we have not \nheretofore. So we are increasing child care almost $2 billion over the \nnext 7 years to compensate for those who will have to work to receive \nwelfare benefits.\n  I will remind Members here that, under the current provisions in this \nbill, no one will be required to work unless the State opts out of this \nformula for 2 years. So, most of the child care burden and the \nparticipation rate starts out at, I believe, 30 percent and phases up \nto only 50 percent of the entire caseload. So we are not saying \n``everybody this year.'' In fact, under the bill the block grant scheme \ndoes not go into effect until October of 1996. That is a change from \nthe Senate bill. As I said, there are certain things in the bill that \nwill be attractive to the other side of the aisle. One of them is that \nthe block grant does not go into effect immediately, as it would have \nunder the Senate bill. It does not go into effect until October 1. So \nwe keep the Federal entitlement for another three quarters of a fiscal \nyear. And it does not go into effect until October 1. So that is a \nplus, I would think, for some Members on the other side.\n\n  The child care money that is there, and the work money that is there, \nwe believe is more than sufficient to cover the anticipated caseload \ngiven the participation rates, the delay in people having to work, and \nthe delay in the program itself, of 2 years, before anyone even in the \nprogram has to work. \n\n[[Page S19142]]\n That is why, with respect to child care, we have backloaded the money. \nThe reason we backload the money is because that is when more people \nwill be required to work and that is when they, the States, will need \nthe money for day care. We think that is a logical way to accomplish \nit. Some would suggest that we are skimping a little bit in the early \nyears. The Senator from Massachusetts thinks that is wrong. I think \nthat is a very wise allocation of resources on the part of the \nproponents of this legislation.\n\n  With respect to the work requirements, we have cut work requirements. \nOne of the things that many Members on the other side of the aisle \nsupported in this bill and were a bit dismayed about with the original \nFinance Committee bill was that it did not have tough work \nrequirements. We have those same tough work requirements in this bill.\n  We believe with the evidence of other States, Michigan as I said, \nbefore, Wisconsin, and others, that caseload does decline when you \nrequire work. Many people who would otherwise get on the rolls who know \nthat they have to go to work opt to go to work instead of getting on \nthe rolls. We have seen that happen.\n  We believe there will be more than enough money. Again, we do \nsomething that we think is very important. We allow for fungibility. We \nallow for flexibility of States to move money from one area to another \nwhere the States determine where their greatest need is, with the \nexception of child care because we have seen that is a very crucial \nitem. So we do not allow that money to be used for other purposes. We \nin a sense have a one-way battle. Money can come in for more child care \nbut no more money than was originally dedicated for child care can go \nout. Again, it is a concession to the other side of the aisle for their \nparamount, and I think legitimate, concern for child care.\n  Another thing we did different than the Senate bill, I think many \nMembers on the other side of the aisle would appreciate, is we separate \nchild care out into a separate block grant. In the original Senate bill \nit was included with the other block grants. There was some concern \nabout the long-term integrity of that fund if it was included. So we \nhave now separated out child care as a separate block grant unto itself \nwhich again is something that many Members on the other side of the \naisle wanted. As I said before, we put more money in child care.\n  The Senate bill that passed here had $15.8 billion in child care for \n5 years. Our bill had $16.3 billion for 5 years--more money in 5 years, \nand more money for 7 years; $5 billion more; again, almost $2 billion \nmore than current law.\n  Another big thing that the other side of the aisle took sort of a \nlast stand on was the idea of maintenance of effort, maintaining the \nStates' contribution to their welfare program--the fear that some would \nargue, its legitimacy. But I side with them. I think there is \nlegitimate fear here that States would race to the bottom. They would \ntake the Federal dollars, eliminate the State contribution, and really \nsqueeze their welfare program down to just where the Federal dollar is \ncontributing and no State contribution.\n  What we have said is in the Senate bill that passed that States would \nmaintain 80 percent of their effort for 5 years. The Senator from \nLouisiana, Senator Breaux, called for an amendment that increased it to \n90 percent. The reason he said that is because he was afraid in going \nto conference with the House, which had a zero maintenance of effort \nprovision--they did not have any maintenance of effort provision--that \nwe had to get to 90 percent simply to go to conference so we can \nbargain because we probably only would end up with a 45 percent--\nhalfway, or 50 percent--maintenance of effort. We came out of the \nconference not with 50 percent, 60 percent, or 70 percent, but a 75-\npercent maintenance of effort which was the original request of those \nwho were working on the provision here in the Senate in the first \nplace. They only went to 80 because they wanted a negotiated position. \nIt succeeded. They ended up with 75 which is what they wanted in the \nfirst place. So maintenance of effort is as Members wanted it in the \nSenate bill.\n\n  So, again the two major provisions that caused acrimony in dealing \nwith this bill--child care and maintenance of effort--one was solved in \nconference to the benefit and even more generous than came out of the \nbenefit, again the Senate bill. The other is exactly where the Senate \nwanted it in the first place, 75 percent over the term of the bill.\n  So, again I wonder where the problem is or may be found for Members \non the big issues because on the big issues, on the real hot buttons, \nwe are in sync with where the Senate was when the bill passed. All the \nsame requirements are there. The 50-percent participation standard by \nthe year 2000, something the other side wanted and we wanted; no family \ncan stay on more than 2 years.\n  Remember, ending welfare as we know it, requiring work after a period \nof time, and then cutting off benefits after a period of time, \nsomething candidate Clinton campaigned on when he ran in 1992 as the \nnew Democrat, is in this bill as passed by the Senate.\n  We allow States to exempt families with children under 1 year of age \nfrom working, something that was advocated by the Democrats and kept in \nin the conference. States that are successful in moving families into \nwork can reduce their own spending. We do allow for flexibility. But \nthe more people you get into work the lower you can reduce your \nmaintenance of effort because you have obviously accomplished the goal \nof the program, which was to get people working.\n  As far as money is concerned, a lot of concern about growth funds and \ncontingency funds, loan funds--the loan fund is the same as it passed \nthe Senate. The contingency fund is the same as it passed the Senate. \nAnd the population growth fund is roughly the same as passed the \nSenate. The transferability of funds is the same as passed the Senate. \nAnd, again with the exemption of the child care block grant which you \ncannot touch, the same as passed the Senate. The State option on unwed \nteen parents, the illegitimacy provision, the same as passed the \nSenate, a very contentious issue, one that was fought here on the \nSenate floor, one that was demanded by the House. They had to have the \nillegitimacy provision as the Senator from North Carolina stated, \nSenator Faircloth. They conceded to the Senate position to allow an \noption to the States to do that. The one concession that we gave--and \nit is a minor one--is on the family cap provision which is, once you \nhave gotten onto the welfare role, any additional children you have \nwhile on welfare you do not get additional dollars for additional \nchildren. Several States have implemented that program. What we have \nsaid in this bill is that there is an opt out.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I ask unanimous consent for an additional 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I thank the Chair for his indulgence.\n  We allow the States to opt out of the requirement of a family cap. \nThat may sound tough. We say that you have to have a family cap \nprovision in your welfare. But you can pass legislation in your \nlegislature signed by the Governor that would remove you from that \nrequirement. In actuality, what this provision does, since, as a result \nof the Brown amendment legislatures and Governors have to pass bills to \nimplement and spend this money, what we in a sense require is a vote on \nthis provision in the legislature. Since the legislature is going to \nact anyway, all we say here is that the legislature has to make a \ndecision whether to allow a family cap or not, and, if they say no \nfamily cap, the family cap goes out. If they want it, it goes in. All \nwe do is force the decision. That is hardly a burdensome addition to \nthis legislation.\n  We have all sorts of terrific reforms on child support enforcement \nand maternity establishment and absentee parents. All were in the \nSenate bill. All were heartily supported by both sides of the aisle. \nAll are in the conference report.\n  Nutrition programs--in the Senate bill we had a block grant option \nfor States for food stamps. That was not very popular on the Democratic \nside of the aisle. Many Members did not like the option for food stamps \nthat passed the Senate and objected to it. We have \n\n[[Page S19143]]\nreduced the opportunity for States to get into a block grant by putting \nup very stringent accountability requirements for fraud and error \nrates, tough error rates than frankly most States will be able to meet. \nSo the open ended allowance for block granting food stamps has been \nreally drawn back;\n  Again, it is something that moves to the Democrat side of the aisle \non this bill.\n  In return for that, the House did not want to block grant the food \nstamps, but they wanted to block grant nutritional programs for \nschools, a hotly debated topic. So what we did there is allow a seven-\nState demonstration project for block granting school lunch programs, a \nvery narrow block granted program with very tough requirement on the \nState.\n  We added back, I might add, in response to the Senator from \nMassachusetts, who said that we dramatically reduced nutrition \nfunding--and, again, this is where maybe the haste in bringing this \nbill to the floor resulted in faulty information getting into the hands \nof Senators. We added back $1.5 billion to nutrition programs, the \nexact amount that many Senators who had been negotiating on this \nwelfare bill on the Democratic side of the aisle asked for--$1.5 \nbillion was asked for; $1.5 billion was put in the nutritional \nprograms.\n  SSI. This was an interesting area of debate for me because I have \nworked on this issue now for close to 4 years and was a very \ncontentious issue when Congressman McCrery from Louisiana and \nCongressman Kleczka from Wisconsin and I broached this situation in the \nWays and Means Committee, and we have come a long way since then. In \nfact, we came so far that the SSI provisions that are included in this \nbill were the same SSI provisions that were included in the Democratic \nalternative welfare bill. There was not an amendment in the Chamber \ndiscussing the reduction of the number of children, drug addicts, \nalcoholics who qualify for SSI.\n  I have heard in some of the reports, criticisms from some now saying \nthat we cut children off SSI. I would just suggest that the same \nchildren that are removed from the SSI rolls under this bill were the \nsame children that were removed from SSI under the bill that I believe \nevery Member of the other side of the aisle voted for, their own \nsubstitute--same language.\n  So there is no argument there, I do not believe, unless there is a \nnewfound argument. Very legitimate change in the SSI Program due to a \ncourt decision which we have discussed on the floor many times. We \nhave, in fact, loosened the provisions in this bill from the provision \nthat passed the Senate just a few months ago.\n  We said with respect to noncitizens in SSI that they would never be \neligible for SSI until they had worked 40 quarters and would be \neligible through the Social Security System. We now allow for people \nwho are noncitizens, legal noncitizens to qualify for SSI benefits if \nthey become a citizen.\n  So citizenship, something many Members on the Democratic side of the \naisle voted for in an amendment that was here that was narrowly \ndefeated in the Chamber, we have now conceded the point that they lost \nhere on the Senate floor and loosened the eligibility requirements for \nSSI, another reason we have moved more toward them as opposed to away \nfrom them in this bill.\n  One thing that we did add is we added to the SSI requirement for \nlegal noncitizens--I should not say requirement, the SSI ineligibility \nfor legal noncitizens, the State has an option as it did in the \noriginal bill to eliminate cash welfare, Medicaid and title 20 services \nif they so desire.\n  If you look at probably the last argument that Members of the other \nside will have in searching for reasons not to vote for this \nlegislation, it will be that we end the tie between welfare, people on \nAFDC and Medicaid. For the clarification of Members, if you qualify for \nAFDC, you automatically as a result of your eligibility for AFDC become \neligible for an array of benefits--food stamps, Medicaid, potentially \nhousing.\n\n  What we have done, since we are block granting Medicaid to the \nStates, we are going to say to the States that they will be able to \ndetermine eligibility for their program. And that includes whether they \nwant to make people who are on AFDC eligible for their program.\n  Obviously, most Governors will tell you that they will. But even if \nthey do not, which I think is unlikely, but even if they do not, the \nCongressional Budget Office has scored this provision, this decoupling \nof AFDC and Medicaid, have scored this provision on the following \nassumption: that all the children who now are on AFDC and qualify for \nAFDC will qualify for Medicaid under some other provision in law other \nthan AFDC.\n  So all of the children that are now qualified under AFDC will qualify \nanyway under some other avenue, and it is so scored. So when you hear \nthe comments over here that all these children will be cut off of \nhealth care, not true, not according to the Congressional Budget Office \nand not according to at least many of the Governors' understanding of \nthe current law.\n  And again according to the Congressional Budget Office, slightly over \nhalf of the women in this program will automatically qualify for \nMedicaid from some other avenue other than AFDC. The rest will have to \nqualify under the new State standards. And as I said before, and I \nthink Senator Hutchison from Texas said it very well, even though the \nGovernor from Texas went to Yale and not the University of Texas or \nPenn State, I am sure the Governor of Texas and Governor of \nPennsylvania have concern for their citizens and mothers trying to \nraise children in very difficult circumstances and recognize the need \nfor the State to provide adequate medical attention. And to suggest \notherwise I think goes back to the days of thinking of Southern \nGovernors standing in front of the courthouse not letting people in \nbecause of the color of their skin. Those days are gone, and I would \nthink that hearkening back to those kinds of days in this kind of \ndebate does not lift the content of the debate to a credible level.\n  That is it. Those are the differences between H.R. 4, as passed by \nthe Senate, and H.R. 4 as before us now, hardly startling differences \nthat would send people rushing to the exits to get away from this \nhorribly transformed piece of legislation.\n  This piece of legislation was crafted to pass the Senate with a \nmargin very similar to the margin that passed originally, with those \nwho would examine the content of this legislation and vote for it on \nits merits not because of pressure from the White House due to an \nexpected veto.\n  On the merits, this bill matches up very well with what passed just a \nvery short time ago. On the merits, this is a bill that all of us can \nbe proud of, that is going to change the dynamic for millions of \ncitizens to put that ladder all the way down, to create opportunities \nfor everyone in America to climb that ladder, as my grandfather and my \nfather did, who lived in a company town, Tire Hill, PA, right at the \nmouth of a coal mine, got paid in stamps to use at the company store, \nand in one generation, in one generation in America lived to see their \nson in this Chamber. That is the greatness of America. That is what \nthis whole welfare reform bill is all about. I can tell you because I \nwas in those discussions. I have been in those discussions on the House \nfloor 2 years ago. I was in those discussions here during the Senate \ndebate, in the back rooms where we worked on all the details of this \nbill; we crafted the compromises, every step of the way from the \noriginal introduction of the House bill 2 years ago to the final \ncompromise in the conference.\n  I can tell you with a straight face that when we made decisions on \nwhat to put in this legislation, not just the principal, but the sole \nreason for changing the welfare system from what it is to what I hope \nit will be was not the dollars that were saved but the people it would \nhelp and the lives that would change for the better.\n  This is not about balancing the budget. This is about creating \nopportunity and changing the face of America, changing the word \n``welfare'' from that disparaged term to one that we can all be proud \nof, that we can all say, yes, America can work to help everybody reach \nup for more.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  \n[[Page S19144]]\n\n\n                 ADJOURNMENT UNTIL 10:15 A.M.
