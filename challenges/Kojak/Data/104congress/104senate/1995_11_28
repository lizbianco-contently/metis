Mr. President, I wanted to speak this morning in response to \nPresident Clinton's address to the Nation last night regarding the \nsending of American troops to Bosnia. I think the President made a \nstrong case for support for his position, but I do not think that he \nmade a strong enough case to justify sending American ground troops to \nBosnia. I would like to address that point this morning because, \nobviously, in the Senate and in the House we are going to begin a \ndebate which could last a couple of weeks here. After there are \nhearings, after there are briefings, presumably we will be voting on \nthe issue, and I think it is important for us to begin to lay out the \nvarious issues, to get response from the American people, to discuss \nthe matter among ourselves, and then be able to make an informed \njudgment.\n  I would note that in checking this morning I found that since we \nbegan keeping track of it in my office, we have received 400 calls \nagainst sending American troops to Bosnia and 6 calls in favor. And I \nspent a fair amount of time during the Thanksgiving recess speaking \nwith groups in Arizona and appearing on various radio programs. In each \ncase, the response was similar to the one which I just indicated. That \nis not dispositive, but I think it is an important indicator of the \nfact that the American people do not sense there is a sufficient degree \nof interest here for the United States to participate.\n  It seems to me there are two basic criteria which need to be \nsatisfied in order to justify the sending of a large number of American \nground troops into a situation where, as the President and the \nSecretary of Defense have both acknowledged, there is certainly a \ndanger of some casualties.\n  The first criterion which has traditionally been applied is that \nthere is a national security interest of the United States at stake. \nSometimes it has been expressed as a vital national security interest.\n  The second is more operational. It generally divides into about three \nsubcategories: that there is a very clear and important mission; that \nthe rules of engagement are clear and \n\n[[Page S 17542]]\nagreed to; and that there is a clear exit strategy.\n\n  Let us talk about both of those in the context of the President's \nremarks last night.\n  I did not really hear a justification for the first point, that is to \nsay, that there is a vital U.S. national security interest involved \nhere. I heard some talk about the fact that it was important for the \nUnited States as a key participant in NATO to be involved in NATO \noperations, and I also heard that we wanted to prevent conflict from \nspreading throughout Europe. Both of those have a national security \nelement to them, but neither goes directly to the question of vital \nU.S. national security interests. If, for example, someone could make \nthe case that war in Europe was about to break out, while American \nlives may not be directly in jeopardy, I think few of us would deny \nthat vital interests of the United States would be at stake sufficient \nfor us to commit to not only ground troops but other kinds of military \noperations to try to prevent that. But that case is not made here.\n  The possibility that there will be some additional civil strife in \nBosnia does not suggest the conflict is going to engulf Europe. The \nsituation is very different than it was before World War I. The Austro-\nHungarian Empire no longer exists. The conditions are simply not the \nsame. So it seems to me a real stretch to say there may be some \nadditional conflict break out, that that would necessarily engulf \nEurope in war and therefore at this point the United States needs to \nsend these troops in order to conclude that. That is just not a \ncredible argument.\n  As to the argument about NATO, it seems to me that either NATO is a \nstrong alliance or it is not. I believe it is a strong alliance. If the \nPresident is suggesting that the difference between NATO continuing to \nexist as a strong alliance and its complete failure is whether or not \n20,000 of the 60,000 ground troops in this operation are U.S. troops, \nif that is the difference between NATO existing and not existing, then \nNATO is in much worse shape than I thought it was, and I think, \nfrankly, it just is not true.\n  NATO is strong. And since we are providing a great deal of the \nsupport for the existing NATO operation, and will continue to do so \nunder this peace process which has been negotiated, in terms of the \nseapower that we have projected, the airpower, the reconnaissance, the \nintelligence, obviously, monetary support that we will be providing and \nmaterial support and a lot of other things, since we have been doing \nthose things and will continue to do them as part of the NATO \noperation, it does not seem to me that we are subject to criticism that \nwe are not supporting the NATO operation. It is just a question of \nwhether some of the ground troops are going to be U.S. troops or not.\n\n  My understanding is that the British and French and perhaps others in \nNATO insisted that part of the ground contingent be United States \ntroops. That is not a justification for saying that therefore we must \ngo. I would have to ask our allies, why? Why is it that you insist that \nnot only do we pay for most of the operation and that we send our ships \nand our cargo planes and our jet fighters and reconnaissance planes, \nand all of the other equipment and personnel that we have in the \nregion, in addition to all of that, a necessary component of this is \nthat 20,000 of the 60,000 ground troops be U.S. troops? Why is that so \nessential? Is it because the Europeans do not have another 20,000 \ntroops? No. That is not it. It is because they want us to be in the \noperation on the ground. And my question there is, why? Why is it that \nthat is so essential? If this matter is so important to the Europeans, \nthen it seems to me that they would pull out all of the stops to \nenforce this peace settlement including providing the necessary ground \ntroops to make it work. And surely among all of the NATO countries \nthere are 60,000 ground troops available.\n  So one has to answer the question I think, why do our Europeans \nallies insist on this? I cannot think of a satisfactory answer.\n  So back to the first criterion. Is there a vital U.S. national \nsecurity interest? The answer is no, and the President has not made the \ncase for it.\n  Let me contrast this with the Persian Gulf war because a lot of \npeople have tried to say that, like the Persian Gulf war, we need to \nfollow the lead of the President and accede to his request for ground \ntroops. The Persian Gulf war and this situation, it seems to me, are \nrelatively close cases, both of them, but one falls on the side of \nsupporting the operation and the other falls on the side of not \nsupporting it. And here is why. Let us say on a scale of 1 to 10, vital \nnational security interest being 10, Pearl Harbor created a vital \nnational security interest for the United States to be involved in \nWorld War II. No question. That is a 10.\n  The Persian Gulf war was a situation in which most of our oil, a \nmajority of our oil, came from the Persian Gulf. Its supplies were \nthreatened. A foreign country had invaded another country, was \noccupying it and was threatening to invade other countries. At that \npoint, it was important for the world community to come together and \nsay to this aggressor, ``No. Aggression will not pay. We will remove \nyou from Kuwait, take you back to where you came from. You have got to \nstop threatening all the people whose oil supplies come from that \nregion.''\n  That is not the same as Pearl Harbor, but clearly vital U.S. \ninterests were involved. And, in fact, worldwide, countries came \ntogether, even other Arab countries came together, in an effort to stop \nthat aggression. And I guess on a scale of 1 to 10, I would say that is \na 6 or 7. As I said, that is a much closer call than a Pearl Harbor, \nbut still justified our action. And a majority of our people and the \nCongress supported President Bush's decision to engage in military \noperations against Iraq.\n  This case in Bosnia, I submit, falls on the other side of the line, \nif you want to say five is the middle ground. It seems to me there is \nonly one reason why it rises to the level of maybe a three or four. \nThat is the moral imperative.\n  Now, a moral imperative is not the same thing as a vital national \nsecurity interest of the United States, but in certain instances it may \ncall upon the United States to do something. That is why the United \nStates has been involved in various humanitarian missions. It is why we \nwent into Somalia with a humanitarian mission to begin with. It is why \nwe were not justified in changing that mission as it later was changed.\n  The United States has done lots of things for a lot of people around \nthe world in a humanitarian way for moral reasons. In addition to the \nhumanitarian support that we provided, we also have supported some \nmilitary operations in support of the humanitarian effort. But that is \ndifferent from saying that in addition to air operations and sea \noperations and humanitarian operations and peacekeeping operations, in \naddition to all those things the United States must send 20,000 ground \ntroops to keep the peace that has been negotiated at Wright-Patterson \nAir Force Base.\n  So, yes, there is a moral imperative. That is what makes this a \nrelatively hard case. But it does not rise to the level of a vital \nnational security interest. It says that we ought to be doing \nsomething. And we are doing something, and we will continue to do more.\n  I submit that the one thing that we should have been doing a long \ntime ago is still missing from this peace agreement, and that is \nensuring that Bosnia can defend itself. For a long time many of us in \nthis body have argued for arming the Bosnians, the Bosnian Moslems, so \nthey can defend themselves. We always believed that a rough parity \nwould eventually be created sufficient to cause the Serbs to come to \nthe bargaining table.\n  What happened when Croatia, after about 3 years, was able to build up \nits military forces sufficient to retake some of the territory that the \nSerbs had taken from them? At that point, the Serbs became defensive \nrather than offensive in their military operations. They also came to \nthe bargaining table because they understood that it was a losing game \nfor them, that the longer they persisted, the more territory likely \nwould be taken from them.\n  So a military balance of forces of some sort was, in fact, created. \nThat is what we have sought when we said we needed to lift the arms \nembargo and support rearming the Bosnian Moslems so they could defend \nthemselves. And \n\n[[Page S 17543]]\nyet that commitment is not part of this particular peace agreement. So \nit seems to me that the one thing that we could do in this situation we \nhave not done in this particular peace agreement.\n  Turning for a moment from the vital national security interest, let \nus go to the other part of the equation, the second part. The mission \nhas not been clearly defined. The rules of engagement have not yet been \nestablished. And, third, there is no exit strategy. Tony Lake, the \nNational Security Adviser, was quoted in the newspapers yesterday--I \nthink he made the statement Sunday--that our first mission is self-\ndefense.\n  Mr. President, the way you fulfill that mission is by not sending the \npeople in the first place. That is not a mission. That is very muddled \nthinking to suggest that our first mission there is self-defense.\n  The mission has to be stated much more clearly, and it has not been, \nnor have the various contingencies been defined. What happens if \nvarious kinds of military conflicts break out? We have not decided how \nwe are going to handle those things. And that has to do also with the \nrules of engagement. They have been only very generally stated up to \nthis point. As my colleague, Senator McCain, has pointed out, what is \nreally glaringly missing is any kind of an exit strategy. A 1-year \ntimetable is not an exit strategy.\n  What is to prevent mission creep, and what is to define success of \nthe mission? Most observers have said for this peacekeeping mission to \nreally succeed, it is going to have to be a commitment of years, \nperhaps decades. And that gets to the next point, Mr. President.\n\n  Perhaps the primary justification that the President has given for \nsending American ground troops to Bosnia is that if we do not do so, \nthe war will reignite and there will be additional suffering. In other \nwords, if you believe in war, you vote no; if you believe in peace, you \nvote yes. That is a false choice, Mr. President. That is a false \nchoice.\n  If this peace that has been negotiated is so fragile, if it is so \nfragile that the only thing between peace and war is that of the 60,000 \nground troops, and 20,000 have to be Americans, then this is a peace \nwhich is bound to fail. It is not a peace of the heart. It is not a \npeace that has been committed to by the belligerents, but rather a \nconvenience that has probably been forced upon the parties and is \nprobably doomed to, if not failure, at least a very rocky road, which \nmeans a lot of casualties on the part of the peacekeepers. And that is \na situation we need to take into account before we support the \nPresident's decision to send the troops.\n  What is it that makes the 20,000 American ground force contingent \nsine qua non, to use that Latin phrase, that without which this peace \nagreement cannot succeed? We are already providing sea power and air \npower and reconnaissance and intelligence and humanitarian assistance, \ndiplomatic assistance, monetary assistance. The President has committed \nto some additional monetary assistance. We are already providing a lot \nof things to promote peace in the region.\n  Our European allies have said we need a ground contingent of 60,000. \nThey are willing to support that with 40,000. What is it that makes the \nadditional 20,000 required to be American troops? Why cannot they be \nEuropean? Is the President saying that if all 60,000 are European, the \nagreement will fail? That is what he said in effect. What is the magic \nof 20,000 of those being American? ``Well, America has prestige, and \nAmerican prestige is necessary to enforce this agreement.''\n  American prestige will be demonstrated every time a U.S. fighter jet \npasses overhead. It will be demonstrated every time you look out to sea \nand see one of our carriers or destroyers cruising in the Adriatic. It \nwill be present with the diplomatic presence of the United States, the \npower of the U.S. Presidency and our support for NATO, and demonstrated \nin 100 ways.\n  What is it that is so magical about one-third of the ground troops \nbeing American? Sure, that will demonstrate an additional presence, but \nis it absolutely essential?\n\n  It is the difference between war and peace, the President says. If it \nis--and I doubt that it is--but if it is, then this peace is too \nfragile, in the first place. We already have signs that that is true \nwith some of the Serb leaders saying in effect, no, never, that blood \nwill be spilled, that they are not going to go along with this.\n  So, if the basic criterion, as the President laid out, was that there \nwould be peace, and we would simply be implementing the peace, one \nquestions whether that condition will even exist when our troops hit \nthe ground over there, if they do.\n  There has been another justification, and I think that this is \nperhaps one of the most difficult for us to deal with because all of us \nsupport, not only the President, but the office of the Presidency. We \ngenerally try to defer to the President and the executive branch in \nforeign policy matters to a large extent, anyway. But the Senate has \ncertain constitutional prerogatives. We have the advice-and-consent \nprerogative. We have the ability to ratify treaties, and so on.\n  The President, in effect, has invited the Congress to decide whether \nor not to support his action or not. So I do not think there is any \nquestion that we need to make an independent judgment here of whether \nor not the sending of these troops is a good idea. But the argument of \nthe President in this regard goes something as follows. Up until the \ntime that the agreement in Dayton was initialed, we were not supposed \nto debate the issue because, after all, there was not anything to \ndebate. We had not decided what to do.\n  Well, the reality was the President had already committed to send the \n20,000 troops, but we were not supposed to debate that because the \nagreement was not clear yet. So we did not. We basically deferred. \nThere were many of us here, myself included, who wanted to speak much \nmore specifically about it, to ask a lot of questions, and perhaps to \nlay down some conditions for the peace agreement, but we did not do \nthat out of deference to the President.\n\n  But now the argument goes, once the agreement was initialed, ``You \nwould be pulling the rug out from under the Presidency, indeed from \nunder U.S. foreign policy, if you did not approve my commitment to send \n20,000 American troops.''\n  That is a catch-22, Mr. President. You cannot argue about it before \nthe treaty is initialed and as soon as it is initialed, it is too late \nto argue about it. So when are we going to have the debate as to \nwhether or not this is good policy?\n  It is true, if the Congress turned its back on the President at this \npoint, there would be some embarrassment to the United States. The \nquestion we have to ask ourselves is: Is the risk of casualties and is \nthe precedent which is being set to send these troops outweighed by \nsome temporary embarrassment to the United States?\n  I submit at this point, at least I have concluded that the answer to \nthat is no, that the Congress has to make it clear to the President \nthat he cannot simply go around making premature commitments without \nthe advice and consent of the Congress, commitments which some of us \nbelieve not to be wise, and then justifying the support for that on the \nbasis that the commitment was made and, therefore, cannot be questioned \nanymore.\n  Either you consult with the Congress in advance and have some sense \nthat you have the support of the Congress and the American people and \nthen argue, once the commitment is made, that it is too late to argue \nabout it, or at least I think you have been estopped, to use a legal \nphrase, to argue there should not be a robust debate about it after the \ndecision has been made. My point is, there is no argument to say, ``I \nmade the commitment to send the troops and now it would be embarrassing \nto the United States, it would diminish the leadership role of our \ncountry if I were not backed up in that commitment,'' to use the \nPresident's argument.\n  My point is very simple. The President should have thought of that \nbefore he made the commitment. He made a commitment, and I think at \nthis point we have to debate it.\n  The bottom line is this: The President has not demonstrated a vital \nnational security interest of the United States involved, nor has there \nbeen a \n\n[[Page S 17544]]\nclear delineation of the operational aspects, its mission, the rules of \nengagement, and the exit strategy.\n  Until those cases are made, I think the President is asking too much \nof us to commit U.S. ground troops to this operation. Therefore, Mr. \nPresident, it would be my hope that after we have had a full debate, \nafter there have been hearings, after there have been briefings by the \nadministration, and after we have had an opportunity to consider within \nthis body and the House has had an opportunity to consider it, that we \nwould have a vote on the matter; that we be able to express ourselves \neither to support the President's request or to reject it.\n  At this point, my own view is that we reject it. I invite any debate \nand any rationale that can be expressed in support of the President's \nposition. As I said, at this point, I think it is far too serious a \nmatter for the United States Congress to support the President's \nrequest that 20,000 ground troops be sent to Bosnia, in addition to all \nthe other things which we have already done and which we continue to \ndo.\n  I close with this point. Nobody wants this tragedy to continue. \nEverybody wants peace to succeed. We all commend the President and \nthose who negotiated on his behalf for this peace agreement, and I \nwould want to do everything we could to support that agreement, short \nof the commitment of these ground troops. They are not the necessary \ningredient to make it work. If they were, it would be destined to fail.\n  Mr. LEAHY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Thomas).

Mr. President, the debate over whether the United States \nshould contribute its troops to a NATO peacekeeping force in Bosnia \nwill be the focus of many speeches on this floor in the coming days. It \nis a subject all of us have anticipated and pondered and wrestled with \nfor some months now, and it is one of those decisions that no one likes \nto make. It is fraught with uncertainties and the undeniable likelihood \nthat Americans will be injured or killed.\n  There will be many chances to speak on this, but having thought about \nit for some time and discussed it with the President and Secretary of \nDefense and others over the past weeks, and after listening to the \nPresident's speech last night and the responses of some of those who \noppose sending troops, I want to say a few words as the debate begins.\n  Mr. President, even before the peace agreement was signed at Dayton, \nthe House of Representatives passed legislation to prevent the \nPresident from deploying U.S. troops to enforce a peace agreement \nwithout the consent of Congress. I believe the President should seek \nthe approval of Congress before sending troops to Bosnia, although I do \nnot believe the Constitution requires it in this instance where the \nparties have signed a peace agreement. I felt it was both unhelpful and \nunnecessary for the House to pass legislation in the midst of the \nnegotiations and before a peace agreement was signed.\n  But just as President Bush sought congressional approval for sending \nU.S. troops to the Persian Gulf--although half a million were there \nbefore approval was given--President Clinton has sought congressional \napproval, and there will be ample time to debate it before the formal \nsigning of the agreement.\n  The decision to send Americans into harms way is the most difficult \nand dangerous that any President has to make. It should be done only \nwhen a compelling national interest is at stake, and when there is no \nother alternative.\n  Like many or perhaps even most Senators, the majority of my \nconstituents, at least of those Vermonters who have contacted me, do \nnot believe that it is in our national interest to send Americans to \nBosnia. They genuinely fear another costly, drawn out quagmire like \nVietnam. Some of them fought in that war, or had family members who \ndied there. Others fear a debacle like Somalia, where in a matter of \ndays a well-intentioned humanitarian mission became a poorly thought-\nout, ill-prepared peacemaking mission that ended in tragedy.\n\n  It is the President's job to convince the American people that Bosnia \nis not Vietnam, it is not Somalia, and that our national interests \ncompel us to take part. He made a good start last night. There are \nstill important questions that need answers--the President said as much \nhimself--but I am convinced that the case for sending Americans to \nBosnia can be made, and I intend to help the President make it.\n  Mr. President, in the past 4 years, a quarter of a million people, \nthe vast majority defenseless civilians, have lost their lives in the \nformer Yugoslavia. We have all read the blood curdling reports of \nhundreds and even thousands of people being rounded up at gunpoint and \nsystematically executed or even buried alive.\n  Countless others have had their throats cut after being horribly \ntortured. Some have been made to eat the flesh and drink the blood of \ntheir countrymen. Thousands of women have been raped. Men have been \nforced to watch their wives and daughters raped and killed before their \neyes. All simply because of their ethnicity, or because they lived on \nland others wanted for themselves.\n  The war has produced 2 million refugees, victims of ethnic cleansing. \nHundreds of thousands more have lived in squalor for years in the \nrubble of what remains of their homes, without electricity, heat, or \nrunning water.\n  There are many, including myself, who believe that NATO should have \nacted much earlier and with far greater force to stop the genocide in \nBosnia. I opposed the use of American ground troops to try to win the \nwar, but we gave too much deference to those who said that airpower \nwould never compel the Serbs to negotiate peace. NATO should have been \ngiven the authority to use unrelenting force when U.N. resolutions were \nviolated time and again with impunity.\n  Our greatest collective failure was to put the United Nations in \ncharge of a peacekeeping mission where there was no peace to keep, and \nwhen it was unwilling or unable to back up its own threats. These \nfailures, which caused grievous damage to NATO's credibility, will \nhaunt us for years to come.\n  But the situation has changed dramatically since then. Sustained NATO \nbombing, coupled with gains by the Moslem and Croat forces on the \nbattlefield, have shown the Serbs that they cannot win what they set \nout to achieve. The exhaustion of the warring factions, coupled with a \nperiod of extraordinarily forceful American diplomacy, has created an \nunprecedented opportunity to end one of the most brutal wars the world \nhas seen in half a century.\n  There should be no mistake. The credibility of the U.S. Government is \ndeeply invested in the success of the peace agreement, and success of \nthe agreement depends absolutely on NATO's enforcement of it. The \nparties signed with that understanding. At the same time, NATO's own \ncredibility and effectiveness depend on U.S. leadership. Indeed, \nwithout U.S. participation, there will be no NATO force, and the peace \nagreement will almost certainly collapse.\n  Mr. President, since the breakup of the Soviet Union and the end of \nthe cold war, NATO's future has been uncertain. Some have suggested \nthat NATO has outlived its usefulness. Others say that since the \nrationale for NATO--deterring a Soviet invasion of Europe--is gone, \nNATO should become a political alliance. Still others want to quickly \nexpand NATO to include all or most of Eastern Europe, and perhaps even \nsome of the former Soviet republics.\n  I mention this because NATO's future is one of the most compelling \nreasons why it is essential for the United States to participate in a \nNATO peacekeeping force in Bosnia.\n  I have been among the strongest supporters of assistance to Russia \nand the other former Soviet States. A democratic Russia is obviously a \nmajor foreign policy priority for the United States. Despite many \nsetbacks, there has been remarkable progress in Russia, Ukraine, and \nelsewhere in the former Soviet Union. But who can predict the next \ndecade? Who can say that the fervent nationalism that remains strong \nthere will not increase to a point when it becomes threatening? It is \nsimply too soon to say what lies beyond this transitional period. \n\n[[Page S 17545]]\n\n  I have been reluctant to support the rapid expansion of NATO without \na thorough discussion of the implications, for fear that it could fuel \nthe very nationalism in Russia that we seek to discourage.\n  But neither am I among those who see no role for NATO today. On the \ncontrary, the United States has an enormous stake in preserving NATO's \nstrength. While NATO's focus will undoubtedly shift over time, the \nfuture holds too many uncertainties, and there are too many areas of \npotential conflict around the world where important interests of the \nUnited States and our allies are at stake, to allow NATO's strength to \nerode.\n  There is no other alliance that comes close to NATO, in power, in \nreadiness, and in importance to the United States. NATO may not have \nsought the role of peacekeeper in Bosnia, but neither can it avoid it.\n  Mr. President, I cannot say whether this peace agreement will survive \nthe test of time. Perhaps no one can. There is ample reason to be \npessimistic, given the history of broken promises and ethnic hatred in \nthe former Yugoslavia. Since the agreement was signed, it has become \nclear that no party is completely satisfied, and some have expressed \ngrave misgivings with some aspects of it. If the agreement unravels, \nNATO forces may be forced to withdraw, rather than be drawn into the \nfighting. Even withdrawal would be risky.\n  But virtually everyone knowledgeable about the situation there agrees \nthat this is by far the best chance for peace since the war began 4 \nyears ago. We and our European allies have an immense interest in \npreventing the continuation of a destabilizing war in Europe, and I \nbelieve we must take this chance.\n  The President has taken a courageous step, a step that reflects the \nbest of this country. Every American should consider the alternative. \nMore mass murder. More towns shelled and burned. More starving \nchildren. More orphans. More horrifying atrocities that are reminiscent \nof the dark ages. If this does not compel us to help enforce an \nagreement we brokered to end this calamity, what further amount of \ninhuman brutality would it take? Should we wait for the slaughter of \nanother 100,000, or 200,000?\n  The President is right. We have a moral responsibility to take part. \nThe Europeans were unable to end the war themselves. United States \nleadership was not the only factor, but without it there would be no \npeace agreement, and the war would go on indefinitely. We should be \nproud of it, and stand behind it.\n  Some have suggested that we can lead without sending troops. I \ndisagree. We cannot maintain our credibility as the leader of NATO if \nwe are not prepared to assume some of the risk. We should remember that \ntwo-thirds of the NATO force will be troops from our NATO allies and \nothers.\n  Mr. President, our troops are the best trained in the world, but we \ncannot eliminate the risks. There are 2 million landmines in Bosnia \nalone, hidden under mud and snow. Each one cost only a few dollars, but \none false step could mean the loss of any American soldier's legs or \nlife. The Pentagon says that landmines are among the most serious \nthreats our troops will face there.\n  This is ironic, since the Pentagon has been actively lobbying against \nmy efforts to show leadership by halting the use of antipersonnel \nlandmines, which claim hundreds of innocent lives each week. Two-thirds \nof the Senate voted for it, but the Pentagon refuses. In the past few \nmonths, several of our European allies have stopped their use and \nproduction of these indiscriminate weapons, but the Pentagon refuses.\n  A quarter of the Americans killed in the Persian Gulf died from \nlandmines. A quarter of American casualties in Vietnam were from mines. \nI can only wonder how many more Americans will needlessly lose their \nlegs or their lives from landmines before the Pentagon gets the \nmessage.\n  We cannot eliminate the risks, but President Clinton has established \nthe right conditions before US troops can be deployed. If the mission \nis limited in time, clear in scope, and achievable, as the President \nhas insisted, we should support it. Our troops must be backed by broad \nrules of engagement that enable them to defend themselves with whatever \namount of preemptive force is needed in any circumstance. That does not \nmean waiting to shoot until they are shot at.\n  Mr. President, I expect to speak again as the debate on this unfolds. \nI intend to support the President, and I expect there will be Senators \nI deeply respect who are on the other side. But at the end of the day, \nif Americans are sent to Bosnia as I believe they will be, I have no \ndoubt that we all will support them, and we will all be proud of them.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/11/28/senate-section/article/S17544-1", "month": "11", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "28", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S17545-S17546]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         TRIBUTE TO MAURICE ``FOOTSIE'' BRITT, AN AMERICAN HERO\n\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Madam President, I rise today to pay tribute to one of \nAmerica's greatest heroes, and certainly one of Arkansas' greatest, if \nnot the greatest, hero in the history of our State. He is Maurice \n``Footsie'' Britt, born in the small town of Carlisle, AR, and raised \nin the small town of Lonoke, AR. He was a football star at the \nUniversity of Arkansas and Honorable Mention, All American.\n  I first met Footsie in the barbershop of my hometown of Charleston, \npopulation 1,200. He had his campaign literature under his right arm--\nor his right stub. He did not have a right arm. He was running for \nLieutenant Governor on the Republican ticket with Winthrop Rockefeller. \nHe had all his literature under his stub and would use his left hand to \npull it out and hand it to you.\n  As I got out of the barber's chair and paid the barber 50 cents for \nthe haircut, this was 1966, Footsie Britt walked in. He had been a real \nhero to me, and I was honored to meet him. Winthrop Rockefeller became \nthe first Republican Governor since Reconstruction in my State. In my \nopinion, he would have never been elected if he had not had Footsie \nBritt as his running mate.\n  But to go back, he was the first American to ever receive the three \nhighest awards the American military can grant for valor and bravery in \none war. He held the Congressional Medal of Honor, the Distinguished \nService Cross, and the Silver Star. I do not know whether anybody has \never equaled that since then or not.\n  What happened to the right arm? It lay on the battlefield near Anzio, \nItaly, where he had been a lieutenant in World War II. As I walked \naround the battlefield at Anzio last year, as the President and \nnumerous Members of Congress went to Normandy and Anzio, I thought \n``Where did Footsie lose his arm?''\n  Madam President, he not only received the three highest honors that \nour military can bestow, he received the highest honor that Britain \nbestows on any non-Englishman, the Military Cross, and the highest \naward that can be bestowed by Italy on any non-Italian, the Cross of \nValor.\n  He was in charge of a platoon and leading a group of men near the \nbeach at Anzio. He saw that some of his men were getting out in front \nof the others. He knew that the Germans were ahead of them and on \neither side of them. And as he had feared, the others got so far ahead \nof the rest of the group that the Germans had them surrounded. They \nknew it, and they surrendered.\n  The Germans took the American soldiers as shields, as hostages, and \nbegan to march them toward the other Americans that Footsie commanded. \nThe Americans held their fire, obviously. And just as they got close \nenough, Footsie shouted, ``Now hear this order by me. Hit the mud!'' \nAnd every one of the American hostages immediately fell down and lay in \na prone position. The Germans, not speaking English and being \ndumbfounded by the order, were confused just long enough for Footsie \nand his men to mow all the Germans down, saving all the hostages.\n  If Footsie Britt had an enemy in this country, I am not aware of it. \nHe was a beloved public servant, not a strident partisan, just an all-\naround good guy. He saw his duty and did it. He was later appointed \nhead of the Arkansas Small Business Administration where he served for \n14 years. His wife, Pat, preceded him in death several years ago.\n  Two weeks ago I went to the John L. McClellan Veterans Hospital in \nLittle Rock, as I do every Veterans Day. The first room I went to was \nFootsie Britt's. He had lost a piece of a foot as \n\n[[Page S 17546]]\nwell as his arm at Anzio, and being an acute diabetic, 48 hours before \nhad had one of his feet amputated. I walked into the room, and I could \nhardly believe that Footsie had had that foot operated on and removed \njust 2 days before.\n  He said, ``Senator, I just want you to know I think Betty Bumpers was \nthe most gracious First Lady the State ever had. She was always \nunfailingly polite and friendly to me. And I hope you will tell her \nthat.'' Shortly thereafter, they had to amputate more of the leg, and \nhis heart just gave out.\n  To youngsters I speak to in high schools and colleges, I always \nremind them of how lucky they are to live in this country, how many \nsacrifices so many brave men and women have made to provide them with \nthe freedom, the rights they enjoy, all the protections of our sacred \nConstitution. They do not understand what I am saying. They cannot \npossibly understand what I am saying. But I say it again today, Madam \nPresident. They, you, I, and every American have lost one of our \ngreatest heroes with the death of Maurice ``Footsie'' Britt, a true \nimmortal.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/11/28/senate-section/article/S17545-1", "month": "11", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "28", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S17546-S17547]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         TRIBUTE TO DON PEOPLES\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, in Montana, we call Butte the Can-Do City. \nAnd there is nobody who personifies Butte's can-do spirit more than its \nformer chief executive, my friend, Don Peoples.\n  Butte's paper, the Montana Standard, recently ran an article about \nDon's career in Butte. Don is a modest person; a man of few words. And \nI suspect he is a little bit uncomfortable with all this attention. But \nit is attention he richly deserves.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Montana Standard \narticle be printed in the Record. And I ask my colleagues to take a \nmoment to read about how a remarkable man has made such a difference \nfor his community and home State.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Montana Standard, Nov. 27, 1995]\n\n                  Perseverance That Twarted Hard Times\n\n                         (By Erin P. Billings)\n\n       Don Peoples still remembers the day in 1983 that shocked \n     Butte and sent its economy spinning downward without warning.\n       The former Butte-Silver Bow County chief executive was \n     driving back from Seattle, and made a phone call to his \n     office--word was the Anaconda Co. was shutting down its Butte \n     mines and laying off nearly 1,000 workers. Peoples was \n     devastated.\n       ``Nobody thought it was going to happen,'' the 56-year-old \n     Butte native remembers, shaking his head in disbelief. ``That \n     was a devastating day for a lot of people.''\n       ``I saw so many people hurting,'' he says.\n       Many long-time Butte residents were struggling to find work \n     and flocking elsewhere for jobs. And Peoples, who was sitting \n     at the helm of Butte's government knew it was up to him to \n     restore citizens faith and turn the economy around.\n       In 1985, ARCO sold the Continental Pit mine to Missoula \n     multimillionaire Dennis Washington--restoring the copper \n     mining legacy and some 325 good-paying jobs to the area. \n     Peoples, many say, was key in bringing that sale to fruition.\n       ``The tax base was eroding, people were leaving--the major \n     element of an economic decline,'' says Evan Barrett, \n     executive director of the Butte Local Development Corp. ``He \n     kind of carried this city by its boot straps in a time that \n     was really bad.''\n       For example, Peoples successfully lobbied to exclude the \n     mine from the boundaries of the active Superfund site; pushed \n     for lower power and freight rates; and helped provide the \n     company with a three-year tax break granted by the state.\n       In addition to helping resurrect the mining industry in the \n     1980s, Peoples was instrumental in creating Butte's small \n     business incubator, the U.S. High Altitude Sports Center and \n     the Urban Revitalization Agency, which provides grants to \n     help renovate Butte Uptown buildings.\n       By 1988, nine years after Peoples took office, Butte's \n     economy had begun to forge forward and the city received \n     national recognition as a National Civic League ``All-\n     American City.'' More than 900 cities nationwide competed for \n     the designation, which 10 cities received that year.\n       ``Don has a dogged preservance to get things done,'' says \n     Jack Lynch, who has served as chief executive since 1990. \n     ``He's not someone who can sit and watch.''\n       That and Peoples' positive attitude are characteristics \n     Lynch says he tries to emulate as the county's current \n     leader.\n       Peoples chose to trade his life in the public eye in 1989 \n     for the private sector and a financially attractive \n     opportunity to serve as head of a major Butte research and \n     development firm--MSE Inc.\n       A decision, he says, he's never regretted.\n       ``You had to be places, when you didn't want to be there,'' \n     the slender, 6-foot-2-inch Peoples says of being county chief \n     executive. ``Now, I have a choice.''\n       Although Peoples no longer governs 34,000 residents in \n     Silver Bow County, he is still active in the community and \n     plays the role as a leader to some 200 employees.\n       And many of his associates say Peoples' dedication is as \n     impressive as his resume. As a community leader, he holds \n     positions with organizations such as the Deaconess Research \n     Institute in Billings, St. James Community Hospital and the \n     Montana Tech and Butte Central Education foundations. He also \n     is active on the Butte-Silver Bow Chamber of Commerce board \n     and an appointee to the Montana Commission on Higher \n     Education for the '90s.\n       Each day, Peoples serves as chief executive officer and \n     president of MSE, where he has successfully put the \n     technologies firm on the map.\n       The company, which once boasted only one research and \n     development contract and had a revenue base of about $12 \n     million, today has tripled its revenue base and has more than \n     20 contracts.\n       Agencies including the U.S. Energy and Defense departments \n     and NASA count on the firm for developments in areas such as \n     mine waste reclamation, thermal technology and advanced \n     aerospace technology.\n       But turning Butte's economy around, and helping to develop \n     one of the county's largest businesses hasn't been easy.\n       Those who know Peoples quickly point to his tenacity, \n     aggressiveness and work ethic--qualities which allow him to \n     get things done.\n       Part of what drives him, people remark, is his tireless \n     devotion to Butte and the people that live there.\n       The lifelong Butte resident was born in 1939 to Jim and \n     Marie Peoples, and was educated in local schools. His father \n     went on to become Butte's public works director, a position \n     that Don Peoples later held.\n       ``He will do all that he can to fight for (Butte),'' says \n     Gov. Marc Racicot, who has known Peoples for about 15 years.\n       The two served on the board of trustees together at Carroll \n     College in Helena, a position Peoples still holds. There, \n     Racicot says, Peoples has fought to raise money and promote a \n     code of ethics at the small private school.\n       ``He's got a way of convincing people that anything is \n     possible,'' says Alec Hansen, executive director of the \n     Montana League of Cities and Towns. ``You just keep pushing \n     them and pushing them until something happens.''\n       When Peoples served as president of the League in 1982, \n     Hansen says, he fought hard in the state Legislature--pushing \n     for workers compensation insurance programs for Montana \n     cities.\n       ``The guy doesn't scare easy,'' Hansen says. ``Nothing is \n     too big--you can do it.''\n       Peoples says he welcomes a challenge, enjoys taking on big \n     projects and likes to win. But with that, he and others \n     admit, comes Peoples' biggest weakness--impatience.\n       ``I have a fairly good temper,'' be concedes. ``I find the \n     older I get, the easier it is to spout off.''\n       For example, Peoples says his patience has been tried over \n     the proposed greenway project, which would turn the Silver \n     Bow Creek Superfund site into a green corridor.\n       The state and ARCO, the company responsible for the \n     cleanup, have battled over whether the mine waste should be \n     removed and treated elsewhere or whether a less costly plan \n     should be implemented that would treat mine waste in place--\n     leaving enough money to develop a public greenway along the \n     25-mile site.\n       But Peoples' tendency to occasionally lose his patience \n     hasn't hindered his ability to convince others to get things \n     done, some say.\n       Barrett says Peoples has an ability to inspire those who \n     work with him, as if he were a coach of a team.\n       ``With Don there's no question that there's a coach and \n     there's a team; he's always a team leader,'' he says. ``He \n     allows people on the team to get their best in.''\n       ``Leaders are far and few between'' and Don Peoples is one \n     of them, says Jim Kambich, director of corporate development \n     and planning at MSE.\n       A modest Peoples quickly brushes off his success as a \n     leader and credits those that have worked along with him. He \n     attributes his achievements to an ability to find competent, \n     hard-working and loyal players.\n       ``He empowers the people under him to look at new ways to \n     do things,'' Kambich says. ``He doesn't ask anything more of \n     you than he would ask of himself.''\n       Peoples' team-oriented attitude shouldn't come as a \n     surprise, as he is an avid sports fan, former athlete and 30-\n     years-plus football referee.\n       On top of that--without missing a day in five years--he \n     runs twice daily as part of a regimen that he says simply \n     keeps him ``feeling right.''\n       And while Peoples will likely continue to jog daily, he \n     says running for public office again is out of the picture.\n       ``I become less political all the time,'' he says. Besides, \n     ``I think you have to have that fire in your belly.''\n     \n[[Page S 17547]]\n\n\n                 RETIREMENT OF SENATOR NANCY KASSEBAUM\n\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I rise to offer my best wishes to our \ncolleague, Senator Nancy Kassebaum. Although we will work together for \none more year--and I am pleased about that--I want to take this time to \nexpress my gratitude to Senator Kassebaum for what she has meant to me, \nto the Labor and Human Resources Committee, and to the Foreign \nRelations Committee.\n  First, to me, Senator Kassebaum is a real class act. When I came to \nthe U.S. Senate in 1986, Senator Kassebaum was the only other woman \nhere. Together we served for 6 years as the only two women in this \ninstitution that represents the entire Nation. We were both elected to \nthe U.S. Senate in our own right.\n  I have tremendous respect for Senator Kassebaum and her views on many \nissues. Senator Kassebaum thinks independently in her political and \npolicy decisions. She understands the issues and is not afraid to stand \nup for what she believes in.\n  While we may not agree on every issue--no one around here does--we do \nagree on some pretty important ones. Senator Kassebaum favors the legal \nright to an abortion; she has voted for gun control measures; and she \nhas supported many measures to improve American education. She has \ndemonstrated great courage and conviction.\n  Second, I salute Senator Kassebaum for chairing the full Labor \nCommittee. She is the only female chair of a U.S. Senate committee and \nshe does the job well. I serve on the Labor Committee, and I know \nfirst-hand how effective Senator Kassebaum can be.\n  The Labor Committee controls some of the most comprehensive and \ncontroversial issues to come before this body. I am talking about \nwelfare reform, health, education, job training and occupational \nsafety--just to name a few. It is not easy. But Senator Kassebaum can \nreally rally the troops--Democrat or Republican to make sure that work \ngets done.\n  When Senator Kassebaum brings a bill to the Senate floor, it is sure \nto pass. She has a thorough, prudent and reasoned approach to crafting \nlegislation. She gives a great deal of thought to the issues, and she \nknows how to build consensus.\n  Together we have fought for the right of women to choice in \nreproductive health matters. We have fought to keep America healthy, \nand we have fought for education for this Nation's students.\n  Finally, as chair of the African Affairs Subcommittee, Senator \nKassebaum fights for policy that represents our values and respect for \nhuman rights.\n  Senator Kassebaum fought apartheid in South Africa. She urged \nPresident Reagan to take action against the white-minority government. \nWhen he did not, she courageously endorsed sanctions against South \nAfrica.\n  I want to thank Senator Kassebaum for what she has meant to foreign \npolicy and for her commitment to Africa, to the Nation, and to the \npeople of this country.\n   Senator Kassebaum says ``the time has come to pursue other \nchallenges.'' I want to wish her the best in that pursuit, and I know \nthat she will set new standards wherever she goes.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/11/28/senate-section/article/S17546-1", "month": "11", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "28", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S17547]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         THE BAD DEBT BOXSCORE\n\n  Mr. HELMS.

Mr. President, I will just speak very briefly. I have \nspoken many, many times about the dangers of landmines, especially \nindiscriminate antipersonnel landmines. I was very proud when the \nSenate went on record by a two-thirds vote supporting my moratorium on \nour own use of landmines. That is something designed to give the United \nStates the moral leadership in arguing with other nations around the \nworld to eventually ban the use of indiscriminate antipersonnel \nlandmines.\n  It was, in my 21 years here, one of those rare occasions when people \nacross the ideological spectrum joined together on one major issue, in \nthis case one of the biggest humanitarian issues possible, but also \nsomething that could affect defense policies of nations well into the \nnext century.\n  Earlier today I spoke of the dangers of landmines in the former \nYugoslavia.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent an article regarding the \ndebate in Congress on landmines, written by Bob Kemper of the \nWashington Bureau of the Chicago Tribune, dated yesterday, be printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Chicago Tribune, Nov. 27, 1995]\n\nCongress Debates Land Mine Ban--110 Million Mines Planted in 60 Nations \n                              Spark Outcry\n\n                            (By Bob Kemper)\n\n       They are trash, the debris of war, like burned-out tanks \n     and bombed-out buildings. But long after peace treaties are \n     signed and soldiers go home, land mines go on killing.\n       Bosnia may provide the latest example. There are an \n     estimated 6 million anti-armor and anti-personnel mines \n     there, only 1 million of which are mapped, according to the \n     United Nations. UN peacekeepers already have suffered 100 \n     casualties from mines in Bosnia.\n       Killing or maiming 70 people a day worldwide--26,000 each \n     year--land mines are especially devastating to some of the \n     world's poorest countries, according to the State Department \n     and humanitarian groups. And with 110 million mines still \n     buried in more than 60 countries, an international outcry has \n     risen and is echoing in the halls of Congress.\n       Led by Rep. Lane Evans (D-Ill.), Congress is taking the \n     extraordinary step of ordering the Pentagon to unilaterally \n     disarm itself of anti-personnel mines, devices that in one \n     form or another have been in the U.S. arsenal since the Civil \n     War.\n       The House and Senate approved a provision in a foreign \n     operations bill that would give the Pentagon three years to \n     learn to fight without anti-personnel mines.\n       A one-year moratorium, which later could be extended, then \n     would be placed on the use of anti-personnel mines by \n     American forces, except along international borders or in \n     clearly marked fields.\n       ``The U.S. government ought to set a moral example, to lead \n     the world to see the menace of land mines in a clear light,'' \n     said Evans, who pushed the proposal in the House while Sen. \n     Patrick J. Leahy (D-Vt.) worked the Senate.\n       No one is blaming the U.S. military for what the State \n     Department dubbed ``the global land mine crisis.'' American \n     forces routinely use ``smart mines'' that self-destruct or \n     turn themselves off after a month or so in the ground. When \n     they do use long-life mines in the field, such as the \n     claymore, the mines are typically removed as the soldiers \n     withdraw.\n       However, Evans and Leahy say that by disarming its \n     military, America sets an example and can prod other \n     countries to follow suit.\n       Evans and Leahy used a similar strategy three years ago \n     when they pushed for a moratorium on the U.S. export of \n     mines. Two dozen nations have since followed the U.S. lead in \n     banning or restricting land mine exports. The most recent, \n     France, went further this fall when it announced that it also \n     would stop making mines and destroy those already stockpiled.\n       Though launched by liberal Democrats, the ban gained new \n     authority on Capitol Hill when pro-defense Democrats, like \n     Virginia Sen. Charles S. Robb, and 25 Republicans, including \n     Senate Majority Leader Bob Dole (R-Kan.), backed it.\n       ``In Vietnam I had a number of my men killed or wounded by \n     various types of mines or booby traps,'' said Robb, who had \n     led a Marine platoon. ``I have visited around the world, in \n     combat areas, literally tens of \n\n[[Page S 17548]]\n     thousands of amputees who were victims of mines and lots of those folks \n     are just children, children who were playing.''\n       Ban proponents say they are singling out the anti-personnel \n     mine because, unlike other implements of war, it keeps \n     killing long after the fighting ends. In Denmark, some areas \n     are still unusable because of mines planted there during \n     World War II.\n       Many of the 200-plus types of anti-personnel mines \n     manufactured around the world are designed to maim rather \n     than kill because a severely wounded soldier is a bigger \n     drain on enemy logistics and medical resources than a dead \n     soldier. Those same mines, ban proponents argue, are \n     transforming farmers in developing countries into financial \n     and emotional drains on their families and communities.\n       Still, the Pentagon is fighting to keep the mines.\n       The Army does not want to give up a weapon on which its \n     field commanders have long relied. Anti-personnel mines are \n     the perfect weapon for defending battlefield positions, \n     protecting economic assets such as power plants, slowing \n     enemy advances or detouring enemy troops into ``killing \n     zones.''\n       Worried about the effect on the Army, Senate Armed Services \n     Chairman Strom Thurmond (R-S.C.) and Sen. John Warner (R-\n     Va.), a senior member of that panel, plotted with House \n     Republicans to kill the ban. They intended to place a \n     provision in the defense authorization bill giving the \n     Pentagon veto power over the moratorium. However, Warner \n     said, he dropped that plan after being lobbied by Leahy.\n       ``Let him have his shot at it,'' Warner said.\n       One remaining obstacle is the difficulty congressional \n     leaders have had getting the foreign operations bill to the \n     White House. The House and Senate approved the bill in early \n     November, but remain divided over a separate abortion \n     amendment, preventing the bill from moving forward.\n       Momentum toward a land mine ban has been building since a \n     year ago, when President Clinton called for the eventual \n     elimination of land mines. Three months later, the United \n     Nations approved a U.S. resolution urging action. Last \n     summer, 280 members of the National Conference of Catholic \n     Bishops meeting in Chicago issued a statement singling out \n     land mines as an indiscriminate killer whose production \n     should cease.\n       Meanwhile, hundreds of humanitarian groups have spent \n     months--and in some cases years--cataloging land mine \n     atrocities and lobbying for a worldwide ban on the \n     manufacture and use of land mines.\n       But this fall, the push for a ban fizzled when 42 nations \n     at a UN-sponsored conference on conventional weapons failed \n     to reach agreement.\n       ``I don't think there were two minutes of serious \n     discussion * * * on a total ban on land mines,'' said Stephen \n     Goose, program director of Human Rights Watch's Arms Project \n     and a delegate to the Vienna meeting.\n       Contrary to Clinton's call for the elimination of mines, \n     many anti-mine groups say, the administration is actually \n     perpetuating the use of mines by pushing for expanded use of \n     ``smart mines'' rather than backing a total ban.\n       ``There is no technological solution'' to the mine problem, \n     Goose said. ``A self-destructing or self-deactivating mine is \n     still an indiscriminate mine. It will still deny the fields \n     to the farmer.''\n       Evans said he hopes Congress's action will redirect the \n     administration.\n       ``The President is far too cautious,'' Evans said. ``We're \n     encouraging them to be bolder, to demonstrate leadership in \n     encouraging other countries'' to give up mines altogether.\n       But Robert Sherman, of the U.S. Arms Control and \n     Disarmament Agency, defended the administration's push for \n     advanced mines and other measures short of a ban, including \n     requiring manufacturers to put at least eight grams of metal \n     into each plastic mine so that they can be more easily \n     detected. Such steps are a much more realistic way to protect \n     civilians, he said.\n       ``We know there will not be a total ban in 1996 or 1997 or \n     whenever,'' Sherman said. ``If mines are your concern, you \n     say this is bad. If people are your concern, you say this is \n     good.''\n       Anti-mine advocates argue that ``smart mines'' often fail \n     to self-destruct, compounding--rather than solving--what is \n     already a daunting problem globally: detection and removal of \n     mines.\n       Some anti-personnel mines sell for as little as $2 to $3 \n     and hundreds of them can be planted in seconds by special \n     artillery or trucks. In contrast, it takes 100 times longer \n     to remove a mine at a cost of up to $1,000 per mine. And \n     that's if the mine can be found.\n       Many modern mines are as small as a can of shoe polish and \n     made of plastic. Their only metal part is the size of a \n     thumbtack, making detection by the 1940s-style minesweepers, \n     still in use today, nearly impossible.\n       Also, for every mine removed, 20 more are planted. In 1993, \n     the UN estimated that 100,000 land mines were found and \n     removed at a cost of $70 million. During that time, 2 million \n     more mines were laid. Even if no more mines were planted \n     after today, experts said, it would take decades and at least \n     $33 billion to clear those still in the ground.\n       The State Department and the Vietnam Veterans of America, \n     in separate studies, found that mines left behind after wars \n     have taken a devastating toll on civilians. Once fertile \n     fields are now too dangerous to plow. Cattle are killed or \n     maimed. Roads and major utilities hampered by mines make \n     producing and shipping goods difficult.\n       ``Without a clear statement by the U.S. that demonstrates \n     that we are opposed to their use, other nations will continue \n     to sell and deploy them,'' Evans said. ``This legislation, \n     like the moratorium on exports, calls a `time out' and puts \n     us in the leadership position to challenge other nations to \n     work with us and solve this global crisis.''\n\n  Mr. LEAHY.

Mr. President, the current Presiding Officer has spent \nsubstantial amounts of time on the floor talking about reconciliation, \nand he feels passionately and strongly, I believe, that we ought to \nbalance the Federal budget. I share that with him. There is not \ndisagreement in this Chamber about the goal.\n  I said back home last week--and I have said here--that in my judgment \nthe Republicans deserve some praise for pushing and pushing for a \nbalanced budget. I commend them for that. I do not commend them for the \npriorities on how they would get there. But, frankly, all of us ought \nto have more inertia to try to put this country's books in order. And \nthe question is not whether. The question is, How are we going to \nbalance the budget in 7 years?\n  Negotiations will begin today or tomorrow between the Republicans in \nthe Congress and the Democrats in the White House on how to do that in \n7 years. I would simply ask the American people, and my colleagues in \nthe Senate, to think through these priorities some because it is not \njust let us do it in 7 years and never mind the consequences. It is, \nlet us do it in 7 years. Let us do it the right way, and the smart way \nfor this country. Let us make the right choices for this country's \nfuture. It is not the only job in front of us. We should balance the \nbudget. We must, and we will balance the budget. But we also must make \nsure that those who are disadvantaged in this country are not ignored. \nWe must make sure that our education system works, and we must make \nsure that our air is clean and our water is clean. Those are other \npriorities as well.\n  But in the terms of choosing priorities by which we balance the \nbudget, I would like to once again demonstrate that there is \nsubstantial difference and a legitimate difference in what we think \nwill enhance our country's long-term interests. I happen to think that \nthere is nothing more important in this country than investing in \nbuilding the best education system in the world. I want, when all of \nthis is said and done, for us to be able to say our generation, this \ngroup of Americans, made a commitment that we want to have the finest \nschools in the world. We want our kids to be the best they can be \nbecause they went to the best schools in the world. There is a little \nprovision in the reconciliation bill, and the continuing resolution \nthat was passed a week and a half ago, a tiny little issue called Star \nSchools.\n  It is a tiny little program, but it is designed to try to lift and \nenhance those schools that are focusing on math and sciences to bring \nour children up to international levels in math and sciences, to be \ncompetitive. This little Star Schools Program was cut 40 percent--40 \npercent.\n  Now, there is a bigger program, a kind of a giant tumor over in the \nDefense Department called star wars or national missile defense or SDI, \ndepending on what name you want to call it. Because this proposal has a \nspace-\n\n[[Page S 17549]]\nbased component, I have heard it called star wars, but nonetheless it \nis a program that, in its infancy, costs hundreds of millions of \ndollars a year, and it is going to grow to billions of dollars a year \nand eventually cost $48 billion. The star wars program was increased in \nthis process this year by 100 percent.\n  Now, the point is Star Schools you cut by 40 percent, star wars you \nincrease by 100 percent. The question is, What do you think is worthy \nof a star here, schools or corporations that want to build a $48 \nbillion star wars program, because that is what this is. This is about \nspecial interests that want to build a weapons system the Secretary of \nDefense did not order, did not ask for, and says he does not need. The \npriority is clear: Star Schools or star wars. Cut Star Schools 40 \npercent, increase star wars 100 percent. If you think that enhances \nAmerica's future, then that is what you do. I do not think it enhances \nAmerica's future. I think it is exactly the wrong choice.\n  I use that example as I have before simply to say the question is not \nwhether, but how, do we balance the budget.\n  Two other tiny little issues. I offered an amendment, and it was \ndefeated on a party line vote, regrettably. It is an issue that I think \nalso describes the how in terms of what we believe in. We have in the \nTax Code in this country a perverse, insidious, little tax incentive \nthat says, move your plant overseas. Close your plant in America, move \nit overseas to a tax haven country, and we will give you a tax break. I \noffered an amendment that said let us reduce the deficit by getting rid \nof this insidious little tax break that says move your plant and jobs \noverseas and we will give you a break. I lost on a party line vote.\n  In terms of priorities, the priority, it seems to me, in balancing \nthe budget is to do what works to help create jobs and opportunities in \nour country. How better to help create jobs and opportunities than to \nshut off the faucet on a tax break that encourages plants to shut down \nin America and relocate overseas and take the jobs that used to be U.S. \njobs and turn them into jobs in a tax haven country.\n  That is a priority we ought to pursue. Again, it is not whether, it \nis how do you balance the budget. Let us balance the budget by getting \nrid of this little tax break that is wrong for our country, that \nweakens our country, that says let us move jobs out of our country. \nThat does not make any sense to me.\n  The smart choice is, yes, Star Schools, education, investment in the \nfuture. It is, yes, jobs, shutting off tax breaks that persuade people \nto move out of the country, and it also is, yes, choosing between a tax \ncut for the very wealthiest of Americans and a cut in Medicare \nreimbursement for some of the poorest of Americans.\n  That amendment also was offered, and I hope that will be reconsidered \nin a reconciliation conference in the next week or two. What we said \nwas very simple. Those of the upper income strata in this country have \ndone very, very well. They have garnered a substantial portion of the \nincome, regrettably, at the expense of the bottom portion of the income \nearners in our country. What we said with the amendment was very \nsimple. We said, let us at least limit the tax break to incomes of a \nquarter of a million dollars or less, and then let us use the savings \nfrom that limitation to see if we cannot reduce the cut in Medicare \nthat is going to affect some low-income elderly folks.\n  Once again, we lost, but again it is choices--what is important and \nwhat is not. Is it important to give the wealthiest people in our \ncountry a significant tax cut? Gee, I do not think so. It seems to me, \nif you look at the statistics, you will find that they have done very, \nvery well, much better, with income growth that is substantial.\n  In fact, the top percent in our country have seen income growths on a \nreal basis of something like 70 percent real income growth in a period \nof a decade, and the bottom 60 percent now sit down for supper at night \nat the family table and talk about their lot in life. What they \ndiscover is that they are working harder and earning less than 20 years \nago when you adjust for inflation.\n  Our point is that we do not think it makes any sense to give big tax \ncuts to those at the upper one-half of 1 percent of the income earners \nat the same time that we are saying we cannot afford Medicare for some \nof the poorest of the elderly. And, again, it is a question of \npriorities.\n  I think that we are now on a track in the next week or two with \nrespect to the reconciliation bill that will be constructive for this \ncountry.\n  I mentioned these three areas only because I think there are \ndifferences in priorities that are legitimate differences. On the other \nhand, it seems to me if Republicans and Democrats can sit down together \nin the next couple of weeks and if the President can sit down with \nCongress, out of the glare of the spotlights, a lot of agreement can \nresult, and we can in fact balance this country's budget and put this \ncountry on solid financial footing for the years ahead.\n  This country, it seems to me, will be advantaged in a world in which \nwe see increasingly competitive, shrewd, tough trade allies and others \nif we find some way to work more together, and I do not think that is \nan impossible circumstance. I know there is a lot of controversy \nfloating around, and I get involved in it from time to time. I hear \nwhat the Speaker of the House says, and I may respond. But the fact is \nthat with all of the controversy which circulates, we are still all on \nthe same team. Our interest is the American economy. Our interest is \nAmerican jobs and opportunities in the future.\n  It seems to me, even though we may belong to different political \nparties, our country will be advantaged if we can find a thoughtful, \nsober, reflective way of choosing the right priorities that all of us \nthink will move this country ahead and build a better economy and a \nbetter future.\n  My hope and my expectation is that maybe, just maybe, as we approach \nthe Christmas season, more of a spirit of cooperativeness will exist. \nWe put this question behind us of whether, and the question now is how \nto balance the budget. And although these are not easy questions to \nanswer, I think people of good will can get together and do what is \nright for this country.\n  Mr. President, I see no other speakers waiting. I yield the floor, \nand I make a point of order that a quorum is not present.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Ashcroft). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. THOMAS. I ask unanimous consent that I may speak for a few \nminutes in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, the Senator from North Dakota spoke just a \nfew minutes ago about balancing the budget. And I was interested and \npleased with his remarks. Certainly I agree with him that probably one \nof the most important issues that we have before us, and have had for \nthis entire year, is the notion of becoming financially and fiscally \nresponsible in this body and in this country, and doing so by balancing \nthe budget.\n  It seems to me that there is a great deal involved with balancing the \nbudget. It is more than a function of arithmetic; it is a function of \ndetermining the direction we take in this Government.\n  It is a function of dealing with spending. There are a number of ways \nto balance the budget. One of them, which President Clinton choose last \nyear, was to raise taxes and continue to spend, and I suppose you could \ndo that. You could balance the budget by continuing to spend and \nincreasing taxes.\n  I think that is not what the American people said in 1994. They said \nwe have too much Government, the Government is too large, it costs too \nmuch, and we need to balance the budget, but we need to balance the \nbudget by reducing the growth in spending. Therein lies one of the \ndifferences.\n  The Senator said we ought to balance the budget. I agree with that. \nWe have not done it in 30 years. It is fairly easy to say we ought to \nbalance the budget. The evidence is that it is very easy to say that \nand more difficult to do it. \n\n[[Page S 17550]]\n\n  He said we ought to balance the budget in the right way. I agree. I \nhave the right way; he does not have the right way. That is the \nproblem. The right way hardly gets to it. But I do agree we need to get \ntogether. There are differences--there are significant differences--in \nhow we do it, and I think it is our responsibility, as trustees for \nthis Government, to find a way to get the kind of agreement that is \nnecessary to balance the budget. We should do that, and we should do it \nsoon.\n  I think we made great advances the week before last by getting an \nagreement with the White House, getting an agreement in this Congress \nthat we will balance the budget in 7 years, using real figures, CBO \nfigures.\n  There are some other words there: We are going to protect the \nenvironment, protect Medicare, protect education. I do not know quite \nwhat that means. We may have a different view of what ``protect'' \nmeans. None of us wants to do away with those things.\n  It seems to me one of the real challenges we have, as we move forward \nwith this idea of balancing the budget, which we must do, is we need to \nstart dealing with some facts. It is too easy to roll over into scare \ntactics in the political response by saying, ``Yes, I'm going to \nprotect Medicare.'' The fact is, you have to make some changes in \nMedicare if you want it to continue. If you want to have a health \nprogram for the elderly over time, you cannot continue to do what we \nhave been doing. So you have to change it. But it is too easy to go to \nthe country and say, ``Those Republicans want to do away with \nMedicare.'' It is not true. It is just not true.\n  ``We are going to do away with education.'' Do you know how much the \nFederal Government contributes to elementary and secondary education? \nAbout 5 percent of the total spending. The Senator from New Mexico, who \nis more knowledgeable than anyone else about the budget, indicated that \nthis budget would have reduced in his State Federal aid by six-tenths \nof 1 percent, and yet here we are going to gut education.\n\n  I was pleased to hear that the Senator wants to balance the budget. \nThe unfortunate part is we hear that all the time and then we go on for \nanother 30 minutes indicating why we cannot do it. The time has come. \nWe have come to the snubbing post. It is time to make the decisions, \nand I think we will.\n  I wish we would have passed a balanced budget amendment to the \nConstitution. The principal sponsor and advocate is right here on the \nfloor, the Senator from Illinois. I wish we had done that for the \ndiscipline that is involved in doing it. It would have said, ``Yes, you \ncan argue about how it is done, but you are going to balance the budget \nbecause that is the Constitution.'' It is in the Constitution in my \nState of Wyoming, and we do it. We do it. We do not talk about it, we \ndo it.\n  So, Mr. President, I look forward to that. I hope we get with the \nprogram in the next 3 weeks. We need to do that. We need to pass the \nappropriations bills. We need to get this balanced budget bill out. We \ndo not need another delay of Government on the 15th of December. We \nneed to get at the task, and I hope that we do it very soon.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. SIMON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, I confess I just got in on the tail end of \nSenator Thomas' remarks. From what I heard, I agree. I hope we can move \nquickly, and it illustrates why Senator Thomas is going to be an asset \nto the Senate. I was told by a House Member from Illinois, Congressman \nDick Durbin, he said, ``You are really going to like the new Senator \nfrom Wyoming.'' I hope I do not get him in trouble in Wyoming saying \nthis now, but I have found that to be the case.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/11/28/senate-section/article/S17549-1", "month": "11", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "28", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S17550-S17551]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 BOSNIA\n\n  Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, we have been discussing the Bosnian \nsituation. I was critical of President Bush for not responding right \naway. I was critical of Bill Clinton when he became President for not \nresponding. I joined those who voted for lifting the arms blockade. But \nI believe the President is acting in the national interest now, and we \nhave to recognize the great threat to the future of our country in \nterms of security is no longer nuclear weapons, I am happy to say, it \nis instability. We are not going to get stability in Bosnia without \nUnited States leadership and involvement.\n  To the credit of the President, Warren Christopher and others, there \nis a peace agreement, which evolved in Dayton, OH, the Midwest of the \nUnited States, and I think it is imperative that we move ahead.\n  Last night, I was reading the Weekly Standard, Irving Crystal's new \nmagazine. I try to get a diverse readership, and I hope it will not \nshock him that I am reading his publication. I ask unanimous consent to \nhave printed in the Record the lead editorial.\n  There being no objection, the editorial was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the Weekly Standard, Dec. 4, 1995]\n\n                     Bosnia: Support the President\n\n       Bosnian peace diplomacy, brokered by the United States, has \n     passed a significant checkpoint in Dayton, Ohio. Now what? \n     Administration advocates of the new accord oversell its \n     merits. Secretary of State Christopher proclaims the \n     agreement ``a victory for all those who believe in a \n     multiethnic democracy in Bosnia-Herzegovina.'' Another U.S. \n     official calls it a ``fantastic deal'' for the Bosnian \n     Muslims.\n       That's saying too much. U.S. policy has never been devoted \n     to reversing all Serbian military encroachments on Bosnian \n     government-held territory. The pact signed in Dayton ratifies \n     most of those Serbian land-grabs--and, in effect, the \n     demonically ethnicized regional politics that impelled them. \n     The country is to be divided along ethnic lines. Its new \n     central government begins life enfeebled. The agreement's \n     free-movement and resettlement promises appear fanciful.\n       But what the peace plan can possibly accomplish--a \n     pacification of Balkan brutality sufficiently complete and \n     lengthy to take root--is good enough. And better than much of \n     the surprisingly strident, even cavalier, Republican \n     opposition to the plan allows.\n       Bob Dole and Newt Gingrich expect the White House to \n     request a non-binding resolution of congressional endorsement \n     for the U.S. peacekeeping deployment required by the Dayton \n     accord. Both men have their legitimate questions about that \n     operation's details and contingencies, and about Balkan \n     diplomacy's ultimate prospects. But they are holding open \n     their options, and seem seriously concerned to maintain, as \n     best they can, a bipartisan and muscular American foreign \n     policy under presidential leadership.\n       Not so some of their vocal Republican colleagues. Phil \n     Gramm, revealing previously undetected powers of \n     international prognostication, somehow just knows that an \n     American troop presence in Bosnia can only bring total \n     disaster. He has ``no confidence'' in the president, whom he \n     bitterly mocks with quotes reprinted in every American \n     newspaper. Aside from Dick Lugar, measured and diplomatic as \n     always, the rest of the GOP's presidential contenders are \n     quick to agree. All firmly oppose Bosnian troop deployment. \n     The Republican House of Representatives has already twice \n     voted to defund the troops if it is not first granted the \n     power to block them outright.\n       If cooler heads are to prevail, they had better open their \n     mouths fast. It is obviously true, as Alan Keyes pointed out \n     in the Florida presidential campaign debate a couple of weeks \n     back, that for Bosnia and the rest of the world ``there is a \n     God'' and U.S. military forces ``are not Him.'' It is also \n     true that there is a serious case against the troop \n     deployment. Charles Krauthammer makes that case elsewhere in \n     these pages.\n       But he does so while candidly conceding the damage such a \n     last-minute withdrawal would do--first to American \n     international credibility generally, and also to the NATO-led \n     European security arrangements in which our national interest \n     is inextricably intertwined. We may not be God, but where \n     global security arrangements are concerned, we are the \n     closest thing there is. And the United States would be a \n     niggardly superpower indeed were we to withhold our mastery \n     and muscle when they are asked for and widely expected to \n     help halt horrifying bloodshed in Europe.\n       We are in Bosnia already. A high-profile regional peace \n     accord, husbanded by American diplomacy, concluded on \n     American soil, and announced in the Rose Garden of the White \n     House, calls for us to go in deeper. To prevent it, at this \n     point, Republicans would be forced to provoke a presidential \n     foreign policy humiliation the likes of which probably have \n     not been seen since the failure of Woodrow Wilson's League of \n     Nations. And they would inescapably signal, in the process, \n     that America is badly confused about its global status. And \n     that an American president can no longer reliably serve as \n     representative of his nation before the world.\n       Such a drastic diminution of presidential authority is \n     dangerous. The Bosnia operation is a judgment call. The \n     strongest case made by Bosnia doves still can't make it \n     anything more than a judgment call. And in \n\n[[Page S 17551]]\n     foreign policy judgment calls, prudence dictates a prejudice for \n     presidential prerogative. Mr. Clinton cannot make that \n     argument all by himself. He can and should, as George Bush \n     did before him during the Kuwait crisis, make a strong appeal \n     to the American people that U.S. national interests are at \n     stake--and that he has a reasonable strategy to fulfill them.\n       Congress, for its part, should hold its hearings and \n     delineate whatever conditions on deployment it believes \n     appropriate. But while they're at it, Republicans should \n     remember why it is they have spent the past 15 years \n     defending presidential leadership in foreign affairs. At the \n     end of the day, the Republican Congress should support the \n     president on Bosnia.\n\n  Mr. SIMON. The lead editorial, Mr. President, says: ``Bosnia: Support \nthe President.'' This is a magazine, as the Presiding Officer knows, \nthat is primarily oriented to people of conservative view and primarily \nto Republicans. The final paragraph says:\n\n       Congress, for its part, should hold its hearings and \n     delineate whatever conditions on deployment it believes \n     appropriate. But while they're at it, Republicans should \n     remember why it is they have spent the past 15 years \n     defending Presidential leadership in foreign affairs. At the \n     end of the day, the Republican Congress should support the \n     President on Bosnia.\n\n  I was pleased last night, Mr. President, when I heard the interview \non CBS, Dan Rather's interview with Senator Dole. Senator Dole, \nobviously, could benefit politically right now by denouncing President \nClinton and the move that was made. Senator Dole, to his credit, did \nnot take that posture. It was a statesmanlike response.\n  I think insofar as possible--obviously, we all have to make judgments \non these things, and I respect those whose judgments differ from me on \nthis--but insofar as possible, we should have bipartisan foreign \npolicy. That does require the President to work with Congress and, \nfrankly, I think more than has been done up to this point by this \nadministration.\n  But the lessons from Woodrow Wilson are that the executive branch has \nto work with Congress, but the other lesson is a lesson from right \nafter World War II when we had a Democratic President and a Republican \nCongress, and President Truman, through General Marshall at the Harvard \ncommencement, suggested the Marshall plan, which we look back upon with \ngreat pride.\n  After that was announced, the first Gallup Poll showed 14 percent of \nthe American public supporting the Marshall plan, a plan that \nultimately saved western Europe from communism and helped to bring \nabout the demise of communism in Europe.\n\n  In the U.S. Senate there was a Republican Senator by the name of \nArthur Vandenberg. The Presiding Officer is nodding as though he \nremembers that. He is too young to remember when Arthur Vandenberg was \na member of this body, but I remember it well. Arthur Vandenberg did \nnot take advantage of the situation but worked with the President for \nthe best interests of this Nation and the best interests of the world.\n  I think that is what we have to do at this point, Mr. President. I \nhope we will. We are going to differ and differ strongly on this thing. \nThat is the way it should be. I hope it will not be on a partisan \nbasis.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

This legislation is also \ncosponsored by Senator Burns, Hollings, Inouye, Hutchinson, and \nKassebaum. It is a bipartisan bill and I urge my colleagues' bipartisan \nsupport in its swift passage.\n\n\n                          legislative history\n\n  Introduced on November 3, 1995, this legislation is in direct \nresponse to the fiscal year 1996 budget resolution which assumes the \nelimination of the Interstate Commerce Commission [ICC] and the fiscal \nyear 1996 Department of Transportation appropriations bill, H.R. 2002, \nwhich provides no funding for the ICC effective December 31, 1995--\nPublic Law 104-50. It is the product of nearly a year's worth of \nbipartisan study, discussion, and work.\n  S. 1396 addresses what is fast approaching an emergency situation, \nthe imminent, congressionally mandated shutdown of the ICC, in just \nover a month. However, it does so in a manner that embodies a \nreasonable oversight structure for our Nation's surface transportation \nindustries. The bill would eliminate scores of unnecessary regulatory \nprovisions in a balanced manner, yet preserve necessary core \nregulations and allow for continued protection of shippers and the \nconsuming public.\n\n[[Page S 17579]]\n\n  This legislation would sunset two Federal agencies, the Interstate \nCommerce Commission [ICC] and the Federal Maritime Commission [FMC]. \nThe ICC would terminate effective January 1, 1996, and the FMC would \nterminate 1 year later, January 1, 1997. The bill would repeal over 70 \nobsolete ICC regulatory functions and transfer residual functions \npartly to a newly established independent Intermodal Surface \nTransportation Board [Board] within DOT and partly to the Secretary of \nTransportation. When the FMC sunsets in 1997, its remaining functions \nwould be transferred to the new Board.\n  S. 1396 reflects a board consensus, as demonstrated by the Commerce \nCommittee's unanimous vote reporting it during its November 9 executive \nsession. That consensus is likewise reflected by the overwhelming 417 \nto 8 vote approving a similar House bill on November 14. These votes \nare the expression of the underlying agreement on fundamental substance \nthat has emerged on both sides of the Hill and both sides of the aisle \nduring the past year.\n  Madam President, it is imperative that this bill be approved promptly \nif we are to authorize an orderly ICC sunset and identify which \nfunctions should be continued and by what agency or agencies, within \nthe constraints of the funding approved. Once authorized, the timely \nshutdown of our Nation's oldest regulatory agency will be ensured. It \nis likewise imperative that the bill's careful consensus structure not \nbe undone by ill-considered amendments.\n\n\n                               background\n\n  I do want to briefly explain some of the underlying philosophy that \nwent into the drafting of S. 1396.\n  Throughout the process, Senator Exon and I have worked together very \nclosely. In fact, much of this legislation initially was written by my \ngood friend. Over the months, much compromise and cooperation have \nproduced what I feel is a balanced bill, addressing the immediate and \ncompelling needs driving this legislation.\n  Our staff members and those of other committee members have \ncollaborated throughout the process. Many long hours have been spent in \njoint meetings with various interest groups and constituents who have \nraised concerns or urged revisions to the bill. We have worked very \nhard to address legitimate concerns, and have made numerous changes and \nrevisions throughout the process in an effort to address those \nconcerns. However, as hard as we have worked to please all parties, our \npolicy decisions ultimately were driven by the need to produce a bill \nwhich could be passed and signed into law as soon as possible.\n\n  Madam President, this is historic legislation. The ICC is our oldest \nindependent regulatory agency. Established in 1887--108 years ago--it \nwas originally created to protect shippers from the monopoly power of \nthe railroad industry. Throughout subsequent years, the ICC's \nregulatory responsibilities were broadened and strengthened, and \nexpanded to other modes. However, in more recent years, particularly in \nthe 1980's, a series of regulatory reform bills significantly \nderegulated the surface transportation industries, reducing the ICC's \nauthority.\n  Even with the considerable deregulation of the surface transportation \nindustries, the ICC continues to maintain a formidable regulatory \npresence. The ICC determines policy through its rulemaking and \nadjudicative proceedings to ensure the effective administration of the \nInterstate Commerce Act [ICA], related statutes, and regulations. The \nICC maintains jurisdiction over the rail industry, certain pipelines, \nbarge operators, bus lines, freight forwarders, household goods movers, \nand approximately 60,000 for-hire motor carriers. Yet its remaining \nfunctions can and should continue to be reduced. The same could be said \nabout every Government agency. Less Government regulation would be \nbetter. S. 1396 moves us significantly in that direction.\n  In my view, the positive and necessary adjudicatory role of the ICC \nshould not simply cease to exist at the end of this year. Indeed, the \nICC has performed and continues to perform important functions. For \nexample, my home State of South Dakota would today have hundreds of \nmiles less rail service than we presently enjoy if it were not for the \nabandonment public interest review authority of the ICC. Indeed, rail \nservice to many smaller communities throughout the country might not \nexist without the work of the ICC.\n  As I stated when I introduced this bill, budget constraints and \nappropriations legislation which terminate the agency's functions at \nthe end of this year render moot any debate over whether or not we \nshould keep the ICC. Given the realities of the budget situation, the \nissue is not whether the ICC should be terminated, but how it will be \ndismantled.\n  Therefore, we are tasked with determining what ICC functions can \ncontinue to be effectively performed by a successor with a very limited \nbudget. S. 1396 provides a reasoned approach designed to ensure \ncontinued protections against industry abuse while at the same time \nassure the economic efficiencies of our Nation's surface transportation \nsystem can continue.\n  Specifically, this legislation would sunset the ICC and transfer its \nnecessary residual functions to an independent Board within the DOT. \nThe Board would administer the residual regulations over rail carriers \nand pipelines and provide limited adjudicatory oversight over the motor \ncarrier industry. The Secretary of Transportation would inherit the \nresidual nonadjudicatory functions governing the motor carrier \nindustry.\n  The overall approach taken in this legislation was to limit its scope \nto the most efficient and simplest sunset and transfer bill, as opposed \nto a wholesale rewrite of transportation policy. Numerous unnecessary \nfunctions were eliminated. In transferring the essential functions that \nremain, some changes to these functions also had to be made due to the \nbudget constraints which will confront the successor agency. While some \nalso advocated a number of changes I considered to be far more \nregulatory in nature than I could support, I also recognize those \nconcerns remain.\n  For example, I am particularly concerned about the concerns of small \nrail shippers and operators in light of continuing industry trends \ntoward overwhelming industry concentration. Some have urged us to \nreregulate the rail industry to remedy these concerns. They argue that \nsince the Staggers Act greatly deregulated the rail industry, shippers \nhave been faced with difficult if not impossible relief mechanisms. \nThey point out that the potential for shipper abuse increases with \nindustry concentration. Their argument merit our consideration. \nHowever, I am not convinced a return to a pre-Staggers approach is the \nanswer.\n  Even though I voted against the Staggers Act 15 years ago, I must say \nit has proved to be extraordinarily successful in reviving a failing \nrail industry. It generally has had a positive impact on shippers and \nindustry alike. Therefore, at this point, it would be unsound policy to \nattempt to reregulate, without a clearer identification of the problems \nand reasonable belief the proposed regulations would remedy those \nproblems.\n  At the same time, we have attempted to address a few very critical \nshipper concerns in those areas in which the ICC's current \nadministrative procedures do not enable a shipper to even bring a \nlegitimate grievance and receive an effective remedy. For example, S. \n1396 would instruct the new Board to complete the ICC's pending noncoal \nrate guidelines proceeding so that smaller shippers have a practical \nprocedure available in which to bring a rate case.\n  Some in the rail industry say this is reregulatory. I strongly \ndisagree. If the mechanisms available under the Interstate Commerce Act \nare so cumbersome and cost prohibitive that a shipper cannot afford to \nseek a remedy--and in fact, the ICC has recognized this for the 10 \nyears in which it has attempted to provide an alternative procedure--\nisn't it our duty to direct the new Board to ensure the ICA is \nadministered effectively? Yes, it is.\n\n\n                         summary of legislation\n\n  Let me now turn to an overview of the bill's main provisions:\n  As a general principle, S. 1396 continues the deregulation theme of \nthe past 15 years by providing further regulatory reductions in the \nsurface transportation industries. Overall, the bill is \n\n[[Page S 17580]]\ndesigned to repeal unnecessary regulations and authorize the transfer \nof residual functions to DOT. As I previously mentioned, many broader \ntransportation policy proposals viewed by the committee to be \nreregulatory were not included in this bill. The committee \nintentionally limited the bill to matters related to sunsetting the ICC \nand FMC and transferring essential functions to a successor.\n\n\n                 1. governmental efficiency and savings\n\n  In response to the increasing emphasis on intermodalism and providing \nseamless transportation via rail, motor, and water modes in the \ntransportation industry, the bill proposes to house the remaining \nFederal Government oversight of these transportation modes within a \nsingle agency with the expertise and perspective to view the \ntransportation industry as increasingly intermodal. Consolidating \nremaining ICC and FMC functions within the Board accomplishes this \ngoal. Further, by placing the Board within DOT, the Board would be \nrelieved of separate administrative costs currently borne by both the \nICC and the FMC.\n\n\n                         2. rail transportation\n\n  Beyond weeding out outdated and unnecessary provisions, the bill \ngenerally does not attempt to substantively redesign rail regulation. \nRather, it would preserve the careful balance put in place by the \nRailroad Revitalization and Regulatory Reform Act of 1976 and the \nStaggers Act of 1980 that have led to a dramatic revitalization of the \nrail industry while protecting significant shipper and national \ninterests.\n  The bill would eliminate many outdated, unnecessary, and burdensome \nregulatory requirements and restrictions on the rail industry. These \ninclude, for example, the elimination of all regulation of rail \npassenger transportation, all tariff filings, tariffs for \nnonagricultural commodities, special provisions favoring recyclable \ncommodities, and restrictions against carriers transporting their own \ncommodities.\n  S. 1396 would retain those provisions needed to preserve an efficient \nnational rail network comprised of numerous individual carriers. These \ninclude Federal regulatory oversight of line constructions, line \nabandonments, line sales, leases, and trackage rights, mergers and \nother consolidations--under a broad public interest standard and with \nongoing regulatory oversight--car supply and interchange, antitrust \nimmunity for certain collective activities--including pooling of \nequipment and services--competitive access, financial assistance, \nfeeder line development, emergency service orders, and recordation of \nequipment liens.\n  The bill would also retain provisions that are necessary to protect \nrail shippers. These include the common carrier obligation, regulatory \noversight of the reasonableness of rail practices, maximum rate \nregulation for captive traffic, advance notice of rate increases, and \nrate tariffs for agricultural commodities and fertilizer.\n\n\n                    3. motor carrier transportation\n\n  With regard to motor carrier transportation, S. 1396 would eliminate \nall vestiges of restrictive entry barriers, based either on a gauging \nof public demand or need for the service or on protecting existing \ncarriers in a market. However, the bill would retain needed safety \noversight and insurance requirements, by converting the existing ICC \nlicensing program into a DOT-administered registration program based \nsolely on a carrier's fitness to operate.\n  The bill would eliminate the regulatorily created distinction between \ncommon and contract motor carriers. Such categorizations have lost \ntheir meaning, because most carriers now operate in a dual capacity. \nUnder the bill, all motor carriers would have a common carrier \nobligation, but would be free to contract for individual shipments.\n  The bill would eliminate tariffs and rate regulation for general \ntrucking. Such regulation, introduced in the 1930's when trucking was a \nnew and struggling industry, has outlived all usefulness. The trucking \nindustry today is a mature, highly competitive industry in which \ncompetition disciplines rates far better than tariff filing and \nregulatory intervention. Only two specialized categories of trucking \noperations would still require tariffs and be subject to potential rate \nregulation. These are residential household goods movements and certain \njoint motor-water shipments involving Alaska, Hawaii, or U.S. \nterritories--where the water portion of the movement is generally not \nas competitive and where advance notice and certainty of rates is \nparticularly needed.\n  S. 1396 would retain the collective activity provisions that allow \ntrucking companies to pool and coordinate their services. It would also \nretain the existing useful background commercial rules for the trucking \nindustry, involving such matters as owner-operator leasing, lumping, \nand cargo liability.\n  While the Federal Government would establish the background rules \napplicable to trucking operations, the ICC's traditional function of \ninformally resolving disputes in these areas would not be continued. \nThe bill enables aggrieved parties to take such disputes directly to \nthe courts.\n\n\n                   4. household goods transportation\n\n  The bill would retain special regulatory provisions for residential \nhousehold goods movements in view of the special consumer impacts \nassociated with them. Because the individual householder moves \ninfrequently, usually has little market information about such moves, \nand generally lacks bargaining power, the householder has little self-\nhelp ability in a transaction with a large personal impact. To prevent \nunfair rate advantages and abuses against this least-sophisticated \nclass of shippers, the bill would retain tariff and rate reasonableness \nrequirements for residential household goods moves. It would prohibit \ncarriers from circumventing fair and uniform rates for residential \nmoves by offering contract rates when dealing directly with the \nhouseholder. The bill would retain the highly successful binding-\nestimate provisions applicable to household goods moves.\n  Because the ICC's informal dispute resolution services would no \nlonger be available, the bill would require household goods carriers to \noffer impartial arbitration of disputes arising out of individual \nresidential moves. This would provide an inexpensive and effective \nmeans of dealing with the typical household goods loss or damage claim, \nwhich is often so small that any litigation requirement becomes unduly \nexpensive and burdensome.\n\n\n                    5. intercity bus transportation\n\n  The bill would remove most remaining regulatory requirements and \nrestrictions from the intercity bus industry. The safety-oriented \ncarrier registration and insurance requirements would be applied to the \nbus industry, and certain limited restrictions against subsidized \ncarriers competing with unsubsidized carriers would be retained. Also, \nthe bill would retain the special public-interest merger standards and \nadvance approval procedures for the intercity bus industry.\n\n\n                    6. transportation intermediaries\n\n  S. 1396 would continue the licensing and bond requirements for \ntransportation brokers, which are needed to protect the public from \nunscrupulous brokers. The bill would also apply the same requirements \nto all freight forwarders. Currently freight forwarders of shipments \nother than household goods are not required to obtain a license from \nthe ICC, but they are required to maintain a minimum level of cargo \nliability insurance. The insurance requirement has been difficult to \nmonitor and enforce without a Federal licensing requirement. By \nextending the registration requirement to all freight forwarders, the \nbill would fill an inappropriate regulatory gap.\n\n\n                       7. pipeline transportation\n\n  The bill would retain regulation of pipeline transportation insofar \nas it involves commodities other than oil and gas--which are regulated \nby the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission--or water--which is not now \nregulated. Because the pipeline industry has the same monopolistic \ncharacteristics as the rail industry, such regulatory oversight must be \nretained to protect against abuses.\n\n\n                       8. domestic water carriage\n\n  The bill would effectively deregulate domestic water carriage in the \ncontiguous-States markets, where there is ample competition to render \nsuch regulation unnecessary. However, the bill would retain residual \nauthority over such water carriage for preemptive purposes, to prevent \nthis transportation from being subjected to regulation under other \nlaws.\n\n[[Page S 17581]]\n\n  The extent of maritime regulation that would be transferred to the \nBoard is as yet undetermined. We plan to produce intervening \nlegislation within the next year paring back the FMC's functions before \nthey are transferred to the Board. In fact, the bill requires the \nChairman of the new Board to meet with the Chairman of the FMC to \ndevelop a plan for the orderly transition of FMC functions to the \nBoard. The Chairman of the Board would then submit the pan to the \nDirector of the Office of Management and Budget, the Senate Committee \non Commerce, Science, and Transportation, and the House of \nRepresentatives Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure not \nlater than 6 months after enactment of this bill. We expect this plan \nwould address any changes in FMC functions that may be legislated after \nenactment of this bill, the effect of this transfer on Board funding \nrequirements, personnel matters, and other matters relevant to the \ntransfer of remaining FMC functions on January 1, 1997.\n\n\n                        9. tow truck operations\n\n  This bill also would correct a serious problem that has been an \nunintended consequence of legislation last year preempting State and \nlocal motor carrier regulation. Specifically, the bill would enable \nState and local governments to regulate the price and related \nconditions of nonconsensual tows by tow truck operators, so as to \npreclude exorbitant prices and unreasonable conditions from being \nimposed on unwilling parties.\n\n\n                     10. intermodal transportation\n\n  This bill would remove all existing restrictions that specifically \nlimit or preclude intermodal ownership and intermodal operations. \nMoreover, by combining the remaining functions of the existing \ntransportation regulatory bodies, the bill should further foster \nintermodalism.\n\n\n           11. transportation of foreign carriers under nafta\n\n  The bill would retain the registration and insurance requirements for \nforeign motor carriers operating in the United States pursuant to the \nNorth American Free-Trade Agreement. The bill would transfer the ICC's \nexisting oversight and enforcement responsibilities in this area to \nDOT.\n  Madam President, I have just given a rather lengthy overview of this \nvery detailed legislation. Obviously, the very nature of this bill--\nsunsetting an agency--requires study and review of the entire \nInterstate Commerce Act. We have done just that over the past year. We \nhave worked to craft a sound legislative proposal. It may not be a \nperfect bill. Not all parties support every single provision. However, \nSenator Exon and I and others have worked and compromised to address \nconcerns throughout this entire process. The time has come to move \nforward. The clock is running.\n  This authorization legislation must be enacted if we are to ensure an \norderly sunset of the ICC. I urge my colleagues to support the bill.\n  Madam President, I will yield to the distinguished Senator from \nNebraska, who introduced the original legislation and has worked as \npart of a team in getting this worked out. I thank him very much.\n  I will say this to the Members of the Senate who have amendments or \nspeeches on this bill. This is a piece of legislation we must pass. We \nare participating in the closing of a governmental agency, the ICC, and \nwe hear all about closing agencies, and so forth. This is actually \nhappening. We are eliminating many of its duties and putting other \nfunctions into the Department of Transportation. Some say, well, you \nare just taking the functions from one place and putting them into \nanother. But they have been streamlined, and they will have the \nefficiencies of scale, being in the Department of Transportation. And \nwe have worked this out in response to the budget and appropriations \nlegislation that has been passed zeroing out the ICC. So we must act on \nthis piece of legislation.\n  I should like to yield to the distinguished Senator from Nebraska for \nhis remarks. And let me commend him for his outstanding leadership on \nthis bill.\n  Mr. EXON. Madam President, I thank my friend and colleague from South \nDakota, the chairman of the Commerce Committee, for his kind remarks. \nHe has outlined very adequately and completely the bill before us that \nwe have worked very, very hard on in the Commerce Committee.\n  I have long been associated with the Commerce Committee, especially \nsurface transportation, all during my years of service in the U.S. \nSenate. Certainly with the end of the Interstate Commerce Commission, \nit is very important that we transfer the duties that have been \nperformed by that agency to a division of Government that can \naccurately carry them out without the expense that we had with the \nInterstate Commerce Commission during their days of reining over a \nwhole series of very complicated issues, which I think they \naccomplished very accurately, very intelligently, and made the right \ndecision for the public at large.\n  But, Madam President, I rise to support the landmark legislation to \neliminate the Interstate Commerce Commission, ICC, and the Federal \nMaritime Commission, the FMC, and to transfer their responsibilities to \na new independent Intermodal Surface Transportation Board, which we \ncall ISTB for short. This will be recognized under and reorganized \nunder the Department of Transportation under this act.\n  Madam President, this legislation builds upon legislation that I \nintroduced earlier this year known as the Transportation Streamlining \nAct. Following the introduction of the act, Senator Pressler, the \nchairman of the committee, and I worked with our staffs long and hard \nto find broad areas of agreement and compromise.\n  The work product of that negotiation is S. 1396, which is before us, \nwhich the chairman of the committee explained very adequately. This \nlegislation represents the latest chapter in a thoughtful and \ndeliberate effort to reform and deregulate America's great \ntransportation sector. The more we can deregulate it, the better it \nwill be and the more service it will provide.\n  In recent years, the Congress has worked very hard to bring fairness, \nefficiency, and productivity to all modes of transportation, many of \nthem cited by Chairman Pressler. The Negotiated Rates Act approved in \n1993 has already saved American businesses billions of dollars in so-\ncalled undercharge claims and litigation, ending the undercharge crisis \nand providing for a fair and expeditious settlement of all undercharge \nclaims.\n  The Trucking Regulatory Reform Act of 1994, which Chairman Pressler \nalluded to, enacted dramatic and revolutionary Federal regulatory \nreform in truck and bus transportation. These measures, combined with \nthe intrastate truck rate and route deregulation provision contained in \nthe 1994 airport improvement program reauthorization bill, represent a \nbody of law which compromises one of the most important, dramatic, \nproductive and meaningful regulatory reform in modern times. S. 1396, \nnow before us, known as the Pressler-Exon bill, continues that \ntradition.\n  Some areas of compromise were difficult to come by. On labor issues, \nI believe we have found a fair middle ground. A fair middle ground is \nthe best we could do in this area, but it does protect the public \ninterest in continued rail service while recognizing the sacrifices and \nthe hardships of those hard-working men and women in the rail industry. \nThe House of Representatives took a similar approach, and in conference \nwe will need to carefully reconcile the two bills. As a long-time \ndefender and supporter of an independent Interstate Commerce \nCommission, I support this legislation with enthusiasm, although I see \nthe end of the Interstate Commerce Commission with some sadness.\n  As one of the few Members of Congress with regular contact with \nAmerica's oldest independent regulatory agency, I know well the \ndedication, the commitment, the hard work of the Commission and all of \nits employees. A grateful Nation should thank those dedicated public \nservants for over a century of hard work. In a different time, with \ndifferent fiscal realities, it might have been possible to maintain a \nstrong independent regulatory agency, but that decision has now been \nmade, and we must move on.\n  That being said, I support S. 1396 with a great deal of pride and \nenthusiasm. This legislation opens a new chapter in Federal \ntransportation policy. This legislative effort can also \n\n[[Page S 17582]]\nserve as a model for other agencies to achieve the efficiencies that \npeople demand, but also do the work that the people expect.\n  One might ask why there is a need for a successor to the Interstate \nCommerce Commission and the FMC. Simply put, if there were no forum to \nresolve disputes, oversee standard contract terms, establish national \nstandards and assure fair treatment for shippers and communities, the \ngreat, efficient and productive transportation sector would simply spin \ninto chaos, and all members of that transportation system of the United \nStates understand that.\n  Each State would develop its own rules, and transportation companies \nwould become entangled in needless complicated litigation. The \nIntermodal Surface Transportation Board, ISTB, will assure that there \nis continuity and efficiency in transportation policy.\n  The new ISTB within the Department of Transportation will continue to \nbe the fair referee among shippers, carriers and communities. It will \nprovide interested parties with one-stop shopping and administer a \nsignificantly streamlined body of law which assures that the public \ninterest is protected in transportation policy.\n  This transfer of responsibility and streamlining of authority will \nreduce costs both to taxpayers and the private sector and, at the same \ntime, assure the key transportation safety responsibilities do not fall \nbetween the cracks.\n  This legislation represents only a first step to even greater \nconsolidation and efficiency of transportation regulation and dispute \nresolution. I am delighted that the Senate Commerce Committee adopted \nan amendment which Senators Lott, Breaux, Pressler, and I offered to \nsunset the Federal Maritime Commission and transfer their \nresponsibilities to the new board next year. If enacted, this \nlegislation will bring to reality my vision that the new ISTB become a \ntrue one-stop shop for all modes of transportation. That is efficiency. \nBy having a staggered sunset of the ICC and the FMC, the Congress has \ntime to thoughtfully review the Nation's maritime laws and to consider \nreforms in this body of law before the final transfer of responsibility \nto the ISTB.\n  Madam President, our Nation takes for granted the blessings of \nAmerica's great transportation system. Every part of the Nation has \naccessible transportation service. As Congress continues its efforts to \nkeep regulation to the minimum necessary to protect the public \ninterest, let us not forget what a valuable asset we have and how \ncritically important it is that Congress carefully choose the correct \ncourse. We have done that in this instance.\n\n  I urge my colleagues to vote today to modernize America's \ntransportation policy and pass S. 1396 as it was reported out of the \nCommerce Committee under the dedicated leadership of the chairman, \nSenator Pressler from South Dakota.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. PRESSLER addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Dakota.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3063\n\n (Purpose: To make minor and technical changes in the bill as reported)\n\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Madam President, I have a unanimous-consent request \nthat has been cleared on both sides. It regards the committee \namendments to be considered and agreed to en bloc.\n  I send these committee amendments, which are sponsored by myself and \nSenator Exon, to the desk to make minor and technical changes in the \nbill as reported.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from South Dakota [Mr. Pressler], for himself \n     and Mr. Exon, proposes an amendment numbered 3063.\n\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that further \nreading of the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, last night the President of the United \nStates spoke to the people of the United States in justification of his \ndispatch of some 20,000 American troops to Bosnia to enforce the \nagreement entered into last week in Dayton, OH, ending for the time \nbeing, at least, the war in Bosnia.\n  President Clinton, I believe, made the best possible case for keeping \na commitment which he made some months ago. I believe that commitment \nwas both unwise and improvident. Nonetheless, it was made by the \nPresident.\n  For me, and I think for most other Members of Congress, the American \nnational security interest in Bosnia is difficult to discern. We will \nbe there in the hopes that we can settle a civil war which has gone on \nin its present form for some 4 years, but in a more profound fashion \nfor at least 600 years.\n  The temporary peace which we will be in Bosnia to enforce is not a \njust peace. In fact, it ratifies almost all of the gains made as a \nresult of the aggression of the Bosnian Serbs, leaves essentially \nunchallenged the ethnic cleansing, the displacement of people, and the \nkilling of tens of thousands of innocent civilians.\n  We will be in Bosnia to support a peace of exhaustion, not a peace of \njustice.\n  Having said all that, Mr. President, and having spoken on this floor \non numerous occasions in favor of an American policy that would have \nrepudiated the arms embargo and allowed the citizens of Bosnia the \neffective means to fight for their own freedom and independence, we as \nAmericans, we as United States Senators, are now faced with a fait \naccompli.\n  The President of the United States has the constitutional authority, \nin my view, to send troops to Bosnia and has announced that he is going \nto do so. As a consequence, however unwise we may consider that \ndecision to have been, we are essentially faced with the proposition \nthat to oppose it, to try to put roadblocks in its path, is likely to \nincrease the already considerable danger in which our troops will find \nthemselves on the front lines in Bosnia.\n  This reaction is one that I think is fairly common among Members of \nthis body. It was expressed by three former National Security Advisers \nand Secretaries of Defense before the Armed Services Committee this \nmorning, and by many outside commentators who have felt this \nadministration's position with respect to Bosnia has been wrongheaded \nalmost from the start.\n  So, sometime in the next week or 2 weeks, we will be presented here \non the floor with some sort of resolution with respect to Bosnia. I do \nnot believe any Member, at this point, can say that he or she will vote \nin favor of it sight unseen or, for that matter, will vote against it \nsight unseen. I hope we will be able to come up with a resolution which \nwill have at least a wide degree of support here in this body, a \nbroader and less partisan degree of support than was the case a few \nyears ago with respect to the war in the gulf. Such a resolution, I \nbelieve, will concentrate on the situation as it exists on the ground \ntoday, given the President's decision, rather than with the process \nthat led the President to this decision, one which gives unequivocal \nsupport to our troops, to the men and women whose lives will be at \nrisk, to the maximum possible extent without saying we necessarily \nagree with the policy that brought them there in the first place.\n  We can all hope that in a period of 1 year the civil passions which \nhave been so brutally expressed during the last 4 years will be \nextinguished. We can be pardoned for believing that is a very \nconsiderable long shot and that our troops, a year from now, are likely \nto come home leaving behind them exactly the situation they found when \nthey arrived.\n  Nevertheless, this is the point we have reached. The President has \ndone his best to explain it to the people of the United States, and I \nam certain that most of them, while they may not like the decision, \nwill certainly provide support for those troops themselves.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/11/28/senate-section/article/S17584-1", "month": "11", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "28", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S17584-S17590]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               INTERSTATE COMMERCE COMMISSION SUNSET ACT\n\n  The Senate continued with the consideration of the bill.\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, the Senator from North Dakota is about to \noffer an amendment, as I understand it, that he has shown me, and I am \nopposed to it. But, to accommodate this Senator and the time \nconstraints that I have this afternoon, I wish to make a few \nappropriate remarks about why, in my opinion, we should not adopt the \namendment that is going to be offered by the Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. President, this amendment seeks to change the way mergers are \nhandled by curtailing the current ICC rail merger review process.\n  Under the current process, and the process in the bill before us--the \nbill by the chairman of the committee and this Senator from Nebraska--\nthe so-called Intermodal Surface Transportation Board will approve, \ndisapprove, or condition rail mergers based on the public interest \nstandard currently used by the ICC, not a narrow, Department of \nJustice-type of antitrust analysis. The public interest standard--which \nis part of the bill offered by the chairman of the committee and \nmyself--allows the board to weigh the public benefits of a merger \nagainst its competitive harms. This standard allows the board to \ncondition and approve mergers that are in the public interest even \nthough they might violate some of the existing antitrust laws. This \nreview has served my farmers, the farmers of South Dakota, and other \nfarmers as well. This concept must be kept as part of our overall \ntransportation network if we want it to run efficiently, especially \nwith regard to rural areas.\n  The current process provides for the input of the Department of \nJustice. Let me repeat that. The bill before us, the Pressler-Exon \nbill, provides for the input of the Department of Justice. This \namendment goes beyond that and gives the Department of Justice the \nfinal say--or the veto, if you will--on rail mergers.\n  Even though a merger might be approved by the Board because it is in \nthe public interest, is protection of captive shippers, and is in the \nbest interest of the transportation system, the Department of Justice \nwith all of the lawyers, or some other third party, could still bring \nsuit and force divestiture based on antitrust laws under the Dorgan \namendment that is going to be proposed.\n  Mr. President, this amendment erodes the jurisdiction of the Commerce \nCommittee, and the new ISTB board because it invests too much authority \nin the Department of Justice.\n  Lawyers are a very important part of our society, depending on your \npoint of view. It seems to me, Mr. President, that, if we are going to \nturn the Department of Justice into a veto authority which they did not \nhave under the Interstate Commerce Commission and take away the \nindependent functioning of the board that we are setting up with the \nPressler-Exon measure in the Department of Transportation, we are \ntaking a significant step backward. I see nothing whatsoever wrong with \nthe Department of Justice being the lawyer-adviser to the new board \nthat is created. They should be consulted as to whether or not there is \na serious violation of antitrust laws. But customarily in business, in \nmy experience in business, and my experience as an individual, I have \nnever let my lawyer make decisions for me. I consult with my lawyer, if \nI need one. I listen to his counsel and advice as to what is right \n\n[[Page S 17585]]\nand what is wrong. But I think the decision has to rest with me. \nLikewise, for the newly independent board that is created under the \nPressler-Exon bill, which vests in a new department under the \nDepartment of Transportation, we do not need to hamstring that board \nand their efforts with regard to what should and should not be done \nwith regard to mergers.\n  So I hope if the amendment offered by the Senator from North Dakota \ncomes to a vote the Senate will overwhelmingly oppose it.\n  The Senator from North Dakota was involved in a similar effort with \nregard to the FCC legislation wherein he and some others felt that the \nDepartment of Justice should have the final say so in matters before \nthe Federal Communications Commission. That measure was turned down \noverwhelmingly by the U.S. Senate because, if we have supposedly \nindependent operating boards, such as the Federal Communications \nCommission, they should not be hamstrung or dictated to by the \nDepartment of Justice. It seems logical as to why we should not accept \nthe amendment being offered by the Senator from North Dakota because it \nwould essentially do the same thing that the Senate voted down with \nregard to the Federal Communications Commission.\n  Therefore, I hope that we will give these new independent boards the \nauthority that they obviously need to make decisions based upon the \npublic interest. If turned over to the Justice Department, I believe \nthat too much of the decisions would be made on legal technicality \nrather than that it is in the best interest of the public, in this case \ntransportation, especially with regard to small States.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DORGAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota is recognized.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3064\n\n (Purpose: To establish certain competition standards with respect to \n                     mergers by railroad carriers)\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk, and I ask \nfor its consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from North Dakota (Mr. Dorgan), for himself and \n     Mr. Bond, proposes an amendment numbered 3064.\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 319, strike lines 1 through 9 and insert in lieu \n     thereof the following--\n       (3) striking subparagraph (E) of subsection (b)(1) and \n     inserting in lieu thereof the following--\n       ``(E) whether the proposed transaction will not \n     substantially lessen competition, or tend to create a \n     monopoly in any line of commerce in any section of the \n     country.'';\n       (4) striking paragraph (2) of subsection (b) and striking \n     ``(1)'' in the first paragraph of subsection (b);\n       (5) striking subsection (c) and inserting in lieu thereof \n     the following--\n       ``(c) The Commission shall approve and authorize a \n     transaction under this section when it finds the transaction \n     is consistent with the public interest. In making the \n     findings under subsection (b)(1)(E), the Transportation \n     Board--\n       ``(1) shall request an analysis by the Attorney General of \n     the United States and shall accord substantial deference to \n     the recommendations of the Attorney General and shall approve \n     the transaction only if it finds that transaction does not \n     violate the standards set forth in subsection (b)(1)(E). The \n     transaction may not be consummated before the thirtieth \n     calendar day after the date of approval by the Transportation \n     Board. Action under the antitrust laws arising out of the \n     merger transaction may be brought only by the Attorney \n     General, and any action brought shall be commenced prior to \n     the earliest time under this subsection at which a merger \n     transaction approved under this subsection may be \n     consummated. The commencement of such an action shall stay \n     the effectiveness of the Transportation Board's approval \n     unless the court shall otherwise specifically order. In any \n     such action, the court shall review de novo the issues \n     presented.

Mr. President, I listened with interest to the statement \nof the Senator from Nebraska [Mr. Exon]. He is always persuasive and \nnever in doubt. He makes an interesting case on this amendment. He \npointed out that I offered a similar amendment on the \ntelecommunications bill, and he is correct about that. I would offer a \nsimilar amendment if I had the opportunity dealing with airlines. I \nwish to explain that because it is the reason I offer this amendment \ntoday dealing with railroads.\n  Let me go to the subject of airline mergers just for a moment. Since \nderegulation of the airline industry, we have had more and more \nmergers. We now have five or six very large airlines in America \ncontrolling most of the air transportation in our country.\n  Prior to 1989, when two airlines wanted to merge, the Department of \nTransportation determined whether they are able to merge or not. They \ngave the approval. The Justice Department was allowed to comment on it \nin terms of the antitrust effects: whether the merger would be good for \nthe country and whether it would be good for competitiveness. But the \nDepartment of Justice is only allowed to comment. Then the Department \nof Transportation makes the judgment. And so often the judgment is made \non issues other than whether this is good for the country in terms of \ncompetition.\n  In fact, I would make the case that a number of the airline mergers \nthat have occurred have not been good for this country. And if you \nestablished an antitrust standard that was worthy, you probably would \nnot have had a couple of these mergers and would not have a couple that \nwill occur in the future. But we have a circumstance where those \nmergers were approved by the Department of Transportation and Justice \nis only asked to give its opinion.\n  With respect to the previous bill that came before the Senate on \ntelecommunications, the Federal Communications Commission will \ndetermine when there is competition in the local exchange with the \nregional Bell systems. I and several of my colleagues said, well, what \nwe would like to do is have the people who know about competition and \nwho know about these standards establish the Clayton Act test over in \nthe Department of Justice about whether or when there is competition.\n  That is why we have antitrust lawyers in this country. We have, \nincidentally, about 1,000 antitrust attorneys working for the Federal \nGovernment, or we used to have. There have been some cutbacks. One \nthousand of them. I used to at least threaten to put their pictures on \nthe sides of milk cartons because I swore that despite the fact there \nwere 1,000 antitrust lawyers, you could see no evidence that they \nlived. You could see no evidence they did anything. You could see no \nevidence that they cared at all whether there was antitrust activities \nin this country. In fact, the fewer companies competing, the better, \naccording to some in our Government. I happen to think the more \ncompanies that are competing, the better for our free-market system.\n  Some speak of a regulating mechanism that is good in a free market \neconomy. Well, I have felt this way about airline mergers. I felt this \nway \n\n[[Page S 17586]]\nabout the competition issues with the telecommunications bill, and I \nfeel this way about the legislation before the Senate today.\n  Let me begin by saying I support the legislation brought to the floor \nof the Senate by the Senator from Nebraska and the Senator from South \nDakota. I commend the two of them as well as Senator Hollings for \nwriting a piece of legislation that I think has great merit and that I \nsupport.\n  I would like to make a change, which is the reason I am offering this \namendment. I would like to make an addition to it, but that does not \ndiminish the fact I think all three have done a good job and I \ncompliment them for their work.\n  This piece of legislation in its larger form abolishes the Interstate \nCommerce Commission and creates a board over in the Department of \nTransportation that assumes many of the functions that the old ICC used \nto have. It does it in a thoughtful way, and it does it in the right \nway, and I support most of what the Senators have brought to the floor.\n  I said during the Commerce Committee consideration of the legislation \nthat I have made the case for some years the Interstate Commerce \nCommission had died from the neck up, and then I found myself mourning \nits passage. When people said, ``Let's kill it,'' I worried that if you \ndo not put something in its place, all you have are larger and larger \nrailroads, and then a bunch of shippers out here trying to deal with \nsomething that is closer to a monopoly than it is to pure competition. \nIt seems to me that we need a regulatory mechanism in between, and that \nis the purpose for which this board is created in this legislation.\n  For that I commend Senator Pressler, Senator Exon, and Senator \nHollings and fully support them. I come to the floor with this \namendment to say I think this bill would be improved with one addition, \nand the addition is offered in my amendment which provides that the \nJustice Department would have an opportunity using the Clayton Act \nstandard on defining competition to review mergers of railroads.\n  I recognize that the Interstate Commerce Commission has had the sole \npurview for reviewing mergers for some 70 years. I understand that. In \nmy judgment, that does not make it right. I would prefer to see the \nauthority given to the Justice Department and the antitrust folks in \nthe Justice Department to evaluate: Is this merger something that makes \nsense for our country, or, with the Clayton standard, will the proposed \nmerger substantially lessen competition, or would it tend to create a \nmonopoly in any line of commerce in any section of the country? That is \nthe Clayton 7 standard which I would like the Justice Department to be \nable to apply.\n  My amendment provides that the Justice Department would make that \njudgment and offer its assessment using that standard to the Department \nof Transportation. And that the Board in the Transportation Department \nwould give substantial deference to the Justice Department antitrust \nanalysis. The amendment also provides that if the Justice Department \nantitrust lawyers who evaluate this determine, using the Clayton \nstandard, that it would lessen competition substantially, it would tend \nto create a monopoly, et cetera, and it is not in the public interest \nto proceed and the board would proceed anyway. This establishes a \nprovision by which the Justice Department or the Attorney General would \nbe able to bring an action for a stay.\n  That is essentially what this amendment does and what it is.\n  The amendment says that notwithstanding any other provision of this \nact, amendments under this section shall apply to all applications \npending before the transportation board.\n  I would like to just talk for a moment about the consequences of \nthis. There are some who are concerned because there is a very large \nproposed merger that has been filed or will be filed that deals with \ntwo very large railroad companies. I have no interest in that question \nat all. I do not have any of those companies in North Dakota. In fact, \nif the larger railroad company that serves our State were involved in a \nmerger right now, I would still be in the chamber offering it, and I \nwould not care what the larger railroad company that serves our State \nthinks about it. My interest is making sure that we have a seabed of \ncompetition that is enforced by evaluating a standard that is \nreasonable for ensuring competition. Because only in that manner will \nconsumers, shippers and others reliant on a competitive system, only in \nthat manner will they be able to see that this market system works to \ntheir advantage as well.\n  I wish to say that I was approached by a representative of one of the \nrailroads today asking why I was doing this, and I explained it had \nnothing to do with their company. In fact, it is interesting in that \none of the companies--and I shall not name the companies--involved in \nthis that is very concerned about it is a company that I have great \nfondness for because when I was a State tax commissioner many years ago \nand we put together, through an interstate compact, joint auditing \naround the country of companies, which made a lot of sense from the \ntaxpayers' standpoint but which angered a lot of big companies. That \nparticular rail company which I shall not name was almost alone in \nstanding up in this country saying what the tax administrators around \nthe country are doing on behalf of many States makes good sense and we \nsupport it.\n  This company exhibited some strength and courage in doing that, so I \nhave some fondness for this company because they stood up and said this \nwas the right thing to do when almost all other corporations in the \ncountry were squealing and were angry because finally the States were \ngetting from them the taxes that they had legitimately owed for many, \nmany years.\n  I say that only to demonstrate that I do not offer this because there \nis any merger pending or because there is any railroad that has an \ninterest in one thing or the other. I offer this because I offered the \namendment on the telecommunications bill, and I would offer the same \namendment on a piece of legislation dealing with airline mergers.\n  It seems to me that we ought not continue a circumstance where the \nregulatory body, that is the old ICC and now the transportation board, \nwill make decisions about whether a merger is in the public interest \nbased on a range of factors that is spelled out in current law, which \ninclude, for example, the effect of the transaction on the adequacy of \ntransportation, the effect on the public interest of including or \nfailing to include other rail carriers, the total fixed chargers that \nresult from the proposed transaction, the interest of carrier employees \naffected by the proposed transaction, and whether the proposed \ntransaction would have an adverse effect on competition among rail \ncarriers in the affected region.\n  These are the criteria that the Board itself will use. But the Board \nmight decide to give substantial weight to two or three of the top \ncriteria when, in fact, you might have a Clayton 7 standard here which \nclearly on its face is demonstrated not to be in the public interest \nwith respect to this merger. I am not talking about this particular \nmerger that I referred to earlier. I am talking about any merger. The \nJustice Department might evaluate that and say, ``This is not in the \npublic interest if you use the Clayton standard.'' And yet the \nregulatory Board might say, ``Well, we view the top three areas here, \ntop three factors, as having sufficient weight, so that we think this \nmakes sense for our country.''\n  My point is that I want those who are experts in our Government in \nthe area of antitrust enforcement to have a valid and legitimate role \nin measuring whether a proposed merger in the railroad industry meets \nthe test, meets the test for all Americans and for consumers. Is this \nin the public interest? Will it substantially lessen competition and \ntend to create a monopoly in any line of business in any section of \nthis country? If so, in my judgment, it should not happen. It might be \ngood for a couple companies now or in the future. But if that is the \ncase, if it does not meet that test, then it should not happen.\n  I want the Justice Department to be able to take that measure and \nprovide that information to the transportation board, and to have \nsubstantial weight and deference given to the Justice Department's \nrecommendation. That is all this does. It does not do any more than \nthat. I hope that, as we talk \n\n[[Page S 17587]]\nthrough this here in the next half-hour or hour, colleagues will see \nfit to support it.\n  The Senator from Nebraska is correct, I offered a similar amendment \nto the telecommunications bill on essentially this same kind of issue. \nHe is correct about that. But it is, in my judgment, the right thing to \ndo for our country, the right thing to do to ensure vibrant competition \nin a free market system. I hope people will look at this amendment and \nthink it has merit and decide today to support it.\n  Mr. President, I would be happy to yield the floor at this point. I \nsee my colleague, Senator Bond from Missouri, is seeking the floor. Let \nme yield the floor to him.\n  Mr. BOND addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. BOND. I am very pleased to rise in support of the amendment by my \nfriend and colleague from North Dakota. I have a very clear-cut \nphilosophy on economic issues. Government regulation is the least \ndesirable and the least effective way to make sure that the customers--\nyou and I as customers; we may be customers down the line--but as \ncustomers of businesses which are buying from other businesses or \nseeking services from them, we are all best served if the free market, \nrather than Government regulation, tells us how the service or products \nare delivered, what cost they are, and how readily available they are.\n  Now, to achieve this, it requires there be competition. You cannot \nrely on the marketplace to regulate provision of services or goods or \ntheir cost if there is no competition. We have in law the Clayton Act, \nsection 7 of the Clayton Act, which requires mergers in almost any \nother industry to be judged, and they cannot go forward if the proposed \ntransaction would substantially lessen competition or tend to create a \nmonopoly in any line of commerce in any section of the country. That is \nbasic American philosophy going back almost 100 years. We need in this \ncountry to have the marketplace work. And the marketplace works when \nthere is competition.\n  Right now we have a situation in rail mergers under the Interstate \nCommerce Act that competition is not necessarily a criteria. The role \nof competition in rail mergers, in my view, should be the same as its \nrole in any other mergers. If it does not leave a marketplace which can \nwork, then we should not permit it. That is why we have laws against \nmonopolization in section 2 of the Sherman Act and section 7 of the \nClayton Act. That is why we have the FTC. That is why we have the \nDepartment of Justice. That is why we have access to the Federal \ncourts.\n  The amendment proposed by the Senator from North Dakota would just \nsay that we have to apply this same test when it comes to rail mergers. \nIt seems to me to make a lot of sense.\n  Mr. President, I really got involved in this when shippers in my \nState expressed concern about their ability to both ship grain out in \nsmall lots of several cars, not unit trains, and purchasers who \npurchase inputs coming in by rail said, ``Hey, we need to have \ncompetition so we can get the best service at the best price.''\n  We had our second joint hearing of the Senate and House Small \nBusiness Committees on November 8 in the House Office Building. I \nthought I would just share with my colleagues a couple of the points \nmade by the witnesses. Obviously, we did not have jurisdiction over \nthis, but as a matter affecting small business, we advised the \ndistinguished chairman and my predecessor in the Republican slot on the \nSmall Business Committee that we wanted to hear from the shippers and \nothers affected. We tried the get a good cross-section. But several of \nthe points made by those witnesses I think should be called to the \nattention of my colleagues.\n  Prof. Curtis Grimm, who is professor and chair of the Transportation, \nBusiness, and Public Policy, College of Business and Management at the \nUniversity of Maryland, College Park, said:\n\n       Under current standards, the ICC could approve a \n     significantly anticompetitive merger, based on claims of \n     speculative efficiency gains which would outweigh competitive \n     harms.\n\n  Mr. President, just because two companies want to merge and they say \nthey can be more efficient, it does not necessarily mean that \ncompetition and the people they serve are going to benefit if we wind \nup with a monopoly situation. Sure, a lot of people would merge if they \ncould take care of all their competition and be the only supplier in \nthe marketplace. We have seen that before.\n  We have seen that in transportation. Did you ever try to buy a ticket \non an airline flight between two cities where there is only one \ncarrier? Wow. It is usually cheaper to go around the world, no matter \nhow close those two cities are. There was a time when only one carrier \nserved Kansas City and St. Louis. You had to mortgage the home to fly \nback and forth. When competition comes in, you are going to find the \nbest price and the best service. The same thing ought to be true, I \nbelieve, in other forms of transportation and, in this instance, in \nrail mergers.\n  One of the witnesses testifying before us, Ed Emmett, is the \npresident of the National Industrial Transportation League, the trade \nassociation representing over 1,000 shippers. He said:\n\n       We are at a critical juncture in U.S. rail transportation \n     policy. It is essential that the Congress act now to change \n     the standards for judging rail mergers to focus more on \n     competition.\n\n  A fellow who relies on rail transportation for his inputs and his \nproducts, James F. Jundzilo, transportation manager, Tetra Chemicals in \nTexas, testified:\n\n       We must put more focus on competition, involve anti-trust \n     laws, competition in the public interest will then be \n     maintained and protected.\n\n  A manager of Lange Co. of Conway Springs, KS, William F. York, said:\n\n       The current merger standards should be revised to focus \n     more on the loss of competition and less upon so-called \n     ``efficiency gains'' or allow the Department of Justice to \n     review rail mergers as they do for other modes, including \n     airlines.\n\n  Finally, one other private sector witness, Fredrick D. Palmer, \nGeneral Manager and CEO of Western Fuels Association, said:\n\n       I submit that a virtually deregulated railroad system in \n     serving a virtually deregulated electric utility industry \n     cries out for the sorts of antitrust regulation to which both \n     the electric utility and telecommunication industries are \n     subjected.\n\n  Finally, we were pleased to have testify before us the Secretary of \nAgriculture, the Honorable Dan Glickman, who said:\n\n       If this latest railroad consolidation is approved, there \n     will only be two major rail carriers west of the Mississippi. \n     This could have serious implications for the rates and \n     availability of rail transportation for the agriculture \n     industry because of the reduced level of competition.\n\n  It is for that reason that we should provide the Clayton Act section \n7 standards to judge rail standards. I am advised the groups supporting \nthis amendment include the National Industrial Transportation League, \nthe Society of Plastics, the American Farm Bureau, Western Fuels \nAssociation, AFL-CIO, Railway Labor, Western Shipper's Coalition, the \nChemical Manufacturer's Association, and I believe that the \nadministration also supports this amendment.\n  Mr. President, I think as we move toward a leaner and more efficient, \nmore streamlined Federal Government, many functions of the Federal \nGovernment are excess, we do not need them. And there is one real area \nwhere we can get rid of a lot of regulation. It is where the \nmarketplace forces competing suppliers of services or goods to compete \non the quality of the service and the price.\n  You do not need Government bureaucracies. You do not need rate \nsetting. You do not need the whole plethora of rules and regulations \nfor Government to run it if to make a buck they have to provide better \nservice or better products at a better price than their competitors.\n  That is the way we get the best deal. That is where our country has \nbeen most successful in making progress. I urge my colleagues to \nsupport this amendment.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. PRESSLER addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Dakota is recognized.\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the Dorgan \namendment. Let me make some general remarks on the issues surrounding \nantitrust and some of the standards that are used.\n  First, let me point out that this amendment is an attempt to change \n\n[[Page S 17588]]\n  the way the ICC looks at the competition among rail carriers, \nparticularly whether the reduction in number of railroads at any one \npoint is harmful.\n  Changing the standards by which rail mergers are judged is very \ncomplicated. The current public interest standard is well established \nand has been in place for 75 years. Changing them now, particularly \nwhile two class one railroads are in a merger proceeding, without fully \nunderstanding how these changes affect railroads, shippers, States and \neven the financial markets, is not the approach this committee should \ntake without fully understanding what we are doing. Unintended \nconsequences could easily result.\n  We have one of the most efficient, if not the most efficient, \ntransportation system in the world. A large part of the system is the \nlevel of competition that exists between the transportation modes and \nwithin the modes. Merely trying to guarantee competition in the rail \nindustry by changing how the ICC looks at competition could easily \nbackfire.\n  In the last 15 years, there have been roughly a dozen rail mergers, a \ntremendous increase in concentration when just measured by the number \nof railroads. However, at the same time, real rates have fallen up to \n50 percent with the decreases occurring every year across all major \ncommodity groups and in all major geographic areas.\n\n  This cannot just be attributed to deregulation, because without \nongoing effective competition, the productivity gains that deregulation \nmade possible for the railroads would not have been passed through to \nthe shippers.\n  Without fully understanding what we are doing in this area, we could \neasily turn back this trend, even though we have the best intentions. \nAs a result, I urge that this amendment be defeated. I urge my \ncolleagues to vote against it as well.\n  Now specifically, the ICC does not apply or follow antitrust law, \nthough it pays very close attention to competitive issues. The rail \nsystem is the underpinning of our entire economy, and many rail \nefficiencies can be achieved only through mergers. The ICC applies a \npublic interest standard, under which the public benefits, competitive \nor otherwise, of a merger, are balanced against any detriments, again \ncompetitive or otherwise, of a merger. This process allows the \nCommission to approve consolidations, even if they otherwise would \nviolate antitrust laws.\n  Rather than applying a narrow DOJ-type antitrust analysis, the \nCommission has consistently looked at all factors in deciding the \ncompetitive impact of rail mergers and has found pure concentration \nmeasures, such as the number of railroads serving a point, to be too \nsimplistic a standard.\n  The UP/MKT merger is a good example. In that case, a number of \nmarkets went from three railroads to two. Various parties, including \nthe Justice Department, argued that there would be a reduction in \ncompetition in those markets and that conditions should be imposed to \nintroduce additional rail competition in them. The Commission rejected \nthese arguments, finding that the continued competition from a strong \nsecond railroad, the increase in competition from the merged system's \nintroductions of new single-line routes and other service improvements \nand other competitive constraints, such as modal and source \ncompetition, would keep competition vigorous.\n  In fact, the Commission was right. Union Pacific, at the request of \nan agency in California, had studied the rates in these 3-to-2 markets \nbefore and after the UP/MKT merger which was consummated in 1988.\n  What they found was that in all cases, rates had decreased \nsignificantly, confirming the Commission's conclusion that competition \nwould be intensified by moving from three railroads--one of which, MKT, \nwas a weak third--to two strong rail competitors.\n\n  The evidence is overwhelming that a mere reduction in the number of \nrailroads does not stifle competition and, in fact, can enhance it \nwhere the effect is to add to the efficiency of the merged carriers and \nto their ability to offer new services.\n  Furthermore, there is ample proof all across the country that where \nmarkets are served by two railroads with broad, equivalent networks, \nrail competition is intense. Perhaps the best example is a precipitous \ndrop in Powder River Basin, WY, coal rates following the entry of CNW \ninto the basin as a competitor, in partnership with UP against \nBurlington Northern.\n  This experience of huge declines in the rates for the transportation \nof Powder River Basin coal is flatly incompatible with any theory that \ntwo railroads in a market will collude to keep prices at or near the \nlevel where other constraints, such as truck or product competition, \nwould cause a loss of traffic. Other examples are the intense two-\nrailroad competition throughout the Southeast, between Norfolk Southern \nand CSX, and for Seattle/Tacoma and other Washington and Idaho traffic \nbetween BN and UP.\n  The number of railroads alone is not what matters, it is the effect \nof the merger on competition. Absent some compelling reason for change, \nwhich has yet to appear, the current process should stand.\n  Mr. President, let me make a few more remarks, and if other Senators \ncome to the floor, I will certainly yield to them, but I want to \ncontinue to state my opposition to the Dorgan amendment.\n  Since 1920, due to the unique place railroads hold in our economy, \nCongress has consistently found that applying a pure antitrust standard \nto rail mergers is inappropriate.\n  Railroads carry roughly 40 percent of the freight in this country. \nThese include 67 percent of new autos, 60 percent of coal, 68 percent \nof pulp and paper, 55 percent of household appliances, 53 percent of \nlumber and 45 percent of all food products. Much of this material is \ndelivered on a just-in-time basis.\n  What is impressive about these numbers is that, unlike the trucking, \nship, barge, and aviation industries, which operate over national \nsystems and which are built and/or maintained by Government and open to \nall operators, the goods that move by rail are transported over fixed, \nregional systems. Due to the regional nature of railroads, much more \ninterchange occurs than in other modes of transportation. That is, \nrailroads hand off cargo to one another while other modes of \ntransportation have very little of this type of interchange--truck to \ntruck, barge to barge.\n  As a consequence, there are natural efficiencies in these other modes \nthat do not readily occur in the rail industry. To achieve these types \nof efficiencies in the rail industry, there must be consolidations. \nMergers and consolidations allow the rail industry to maximize the use \nof its tracks, cut down on interchange points, get the most out of \nswitching yards, consolidate terminals and, in short, provide better \nservice to its customers at the lower cost.\n  In the past, Congress has recognized that rail consolidations cannot \noccur if rails are subject to the normal antitrust tests imposed on \nother businesses. What makes the ICC test different? There are three \nmajor components.\n  The first is the use of the public interest standard. When looking at \na merger, the Department of Justice focuses almost exclusively on \npossible reductions in competition. Under a pure antitrust review, the \nJustice Department could deny all rail mergers, which is what happened \nbefore the public interest standard was adopted. The ICC, on the other \nhand, takes into account both the public benefits of a merger, in terms \nof increased efficiencies, better service and enhanced competition, and \nany harms, in terms of reduced competition and loss of service.\n  The ICC also has the power to condition mergers to take care of \nanticompetitive concerns, while the Department of Justice could try to \nnegotiate conditions, it does not have the same power and discretion as \nthe ICC. As a result, the ICC can condition and approve mergers that \nare in the public interest but might normally fail a review by the \nDepartment of Justice.\n\n  The second is the open and well-developed process the ICC has for \nreviewing rail mergers. The process includes discovery, the development \nof a detailed record and a full and fair opportunity for all affected \nparties, including Federal agencies, States, localities, shippers and \nlabor to be heard.\n  The DOJ process, on the other hand, is a closed informal ex parte \nprocess in \n\n[[Page S 17589]]\nwhich DOJ speaks with only those persons it chooses to and hears only \nthe evidence it chooses to. There is no opportunity for discovery and \nno opportunity to learn and to respond to what others are saying.\n  Taken together, these first two points are extremely important. \nRailroads cannot be duplicated. The lines that exist today are \nessentially it. While spur lines and short lines may be built, there \nwill be no more railroads built from Chicago to Los Angeles or New York \nto St. Louis, not in the near future at least.\n  A fair, impartial system bound by rules and precedent where all \nparties can be heard is important in deciding how these systems are \nrationalized. A DOJ review is far more subjective. All parties may not \nbe heard and DOJ can decide which types of traffic patterns to look at, \nthereby making the process unpredictable from one case to another, from \none administration to another.\n  So I think, in looking at this, we have to look at what we are \ndealing with in the uniqueness of railroads. We will not have more \nrailroad lines built in this country in terms of major routes from \nChicago to Los Angeles or New York to St. Louis. We will have those \nremaining. But the question is a public interest standard allows some \nflexibility on the part of the rulemaking body which will now be in the \nDepartment of Transportation.\n  The third component is the actual approval. The Department of Justice \ndoes not approve mergers, it merely indicates whether or not the \nGovernment will bring suit to stop it. I think now under the Hart-\nScott-Rodino standard, companies can get an opinion before they \nactually go to the expense of getting together.\n  The ICC process brings with it a formal approval and preemption of \nother laws. This is important for a number of reasons. Without formal \napproval, abandonments or line sales contemplated by a merger will have \nto be approved by another agency. State laws designed to prevent or \nhinder mergers will not be preempted. This is particularly important to \nthe free flow of interstate commerce. Further, private parties would \nnot be prohibited from bringing suit to seek conditions or block the \ntransaction.\n\n  Finally, the Rail Labor Act would not be preempted. This is critical. \nMost railroads have 13 different unions with hundreds of different \ncontracts. Absent the preemption of the Rail Labor Act and the \nimposition of labor protection conditions, the merging carriers would \nbe forced to negotiate implementation agreements with each union under \nthe Rail Labor Act. Because rail transportation is so vital to the \neconomy, this act was created ``to avoid any interruption to \ncommerce.'' The act achieves this goal by obligating management and \nlabor to negotiate using a long, drawn-out process. Using this act to \nnegotiate the implementation of a merger would take years. As a result, \nwithout a formal approval, even if a merger were approved by the \nDepartment of Justice it would more than likely be years, if ever, \nbefore it could be implemented.\n  At the heart of this debate is, What is best for transportation \npolicy? The more than 500 railroads that are in existence today are an \nintegral part of our country's transportation system and are a linchpin \nin our economy. We have the best rail system in the world. The long-\nestablished national railroad merger policy has served our country \nwell. Absent some compelling reason, there is no basis for gambling \nwith the future of an industry that is so important to our Nation. That \nis an important point.\n\n  The second point is, the Senator from South Dakota spoke of \nderegulation. I am probably much less a fan of deregulation than he or \nsome others in this Chamber. There are certain areas in our country \nwhere regulation, I think, is critical, where, without regulation, you \nget price gouging, you get pricing outside of a free market that \ndisadvantages consumers. I will give some examples of that.\n  While I say this, I am not opposed to all deregulation. Some of it \nhas been just fine. But the Senator from South Dakota and I come from \nStates that are sparsely populated, and we often, especially in the \narea of transportation, suffer the consequences of a deregulated \nenvironment in which, without competition, they extract prices that are \nunreasonable.\n  I used an example of the airline industry in the Commerce Committee \nthat the Senator from South Dakota will recall. I held up a picture of \na big Holstein milk cow, called Salem Sue. It is the world's largest \ncow. It happens to be metal, but it is the largest cow. It sits on a \nhill about 25 or 30 miles from the airport in Bismarck, ND, if you \ndrive down Interstate 94. I pointed out, if you get on a plane here in \nWashington, DC--and I admit, there are probably not a lot of folks who \nhave an urgent desire to go see the world's largest cow just for the \nsake of going to see the largest cow--but if your desire is to go from \nWashington, DC, to see the world's largest Holstein cow, 30 miles from \nthe Bismarck airport, you will pay more money for that trip than if you \nget on an airplane in Washington, DC, and fly to London to see Big Ben.\n  Or, let us decide you want to see Mickey Mouse and decide to fly to \nDisneyland in Los Angeles. You fly twice as far and pay half as much as \ngetting on an airplane here and flying to Bismarck. Question: Why would \nthat be? Answer: Because we do not have substantial competition. We do \nnot have the kind of competition in the airline industry that you have \nif you are in Chicago or Los Angeles. There, if you show up at the \nairport you have dozens of choices, all competing against each other, \nand the result is attractive choices at lower prices. But, with \nderegulation in the airline industry, we have fewer carriers, fewer \nchoices, and higher prices.\n  Now, deregulation is not always a boon to areas of the country that \nare sparsely populated. When you talk about deregulation with respect \nto railroad carriers, you must find a way, it seems to me, to provide \nprotections for consumers. My concern about all of this is that the \nconsumers be afforded an opportunity to have a price in the open market \nsystem or the free market system that is a fair price. We can foresee \ncircumstances, and we have already seen some in this country, where the \nprices charged in areas where there is not substantial competition are \nprices far above those that should be charged.\n  I mentioned earlier that my amendment is not directed at any carrier \nor any company or any merger. I mentioned I was interested in the \ntelecommunications legislation, and I rose to offer an amendment \nincluding the Department of Justice there. I also have been involved in \nsimilar issues.\n  About 3 weeks ago, I asked the Banking Committee in the Senate to \nhold hearings on bank mergers. This is not a newfound interest of mine. \nI was on a program awhile back and they asked me about my interests in \nhaving hearings on bank mergers. We were talking about a specific \nmerger where two very large banks were combining and merging to be a \nmuch, much larger bank. They said, ``Does that not make sense? Two \nbanks become one and you are able to get rid of a lot of overhead and \nlay off 6,000 or 8,000 people. Does it not make sense to be more \nefficient?\"\n  I said, ``Following that logic, it makes sense to have only one bank \nin America, just one. That way you do not have any duplication. Of \ncourse, you do not have any competition either.''\n  Following this to its extreme, this notion of efficiency without \ncaring much about what it does to the free marketplace and without \ncaring much about what violation occurs to the issue of competition, I \nsuppose you could make a case that in every industry the fewer \ncompanies the better, because the fewer companies the more efficient \nyou are going to become. You can lay off people. Of course, it would \nnot be very efficient for consumers, because you can then engage in \npredatory pricing and no one can do very much about it.\n  The point I am making is, I am not here because of a railroad or a \nmerger. I have been involved in the issue of bank mergers, calling for \nhearings at the Senate Banking Committee in recent weeks on that. I \nhave been on the floor on several other merger issues. I hope that the \nSenate will take a look at this and decide this makes sense. If it does \nnot, at the next opportunity I will again raise this issue.\n  Frankly, there are not many people in the Senate, or the House, for \nthat matter, who care to talk much about antitrust issues. First of \nall, it puts most people to sleep. You know, it is \n\n[[Page S 17590]]\nbetter than medicine to put people to sleep. Nobody cares much about \nit. Nobody understands it much. It is, to some people, just plain \ntheory. But, if you are a shipper and you are somewhere along the line \nsomeplace and the company that has captured the competition and is now \nthe only opportunity for you to ship says to you, ``By the way, here is \nmy price; if you do not like it, tough luck,'' all of a sudden, this \nhas more meaning than theory.\n  If you are a traveler on an airline and you have no competition when \nyou used to, but now the only remaining carrier that bought its \ncompetition and became one says to you, ``By the way, here is my price; \nif you do in the like it, do not travel,'' then this is more than \ntheory.\n  That is what persuades me to believe that in a free market system, if \nyou preach competition but do not care very much about whether \nmeaningful competition exists, or whether we have adequate enforcement \nof antitrust standards, then in my judgment you do no favor to the free \nmarket economy.\n  I hope people will consider this on its merits and consider that it \nwould be wise for our country and for public policy to ask that this \nlegislation be amended with the amendment I have offered, along with \nSenator Bond.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor. I make the point of order a quorum \nis not present.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Thompson). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I rise to speak against the Dorgan \namendment.\n  I do very much appreciate the chairman of the committee putting \nforward this legislation. Our budget resolution envisions that the ICC \nwill go out of existence. I think it is important that we pass this \nlegislation. But I do not think it was the intent of the committee to \nchange all the rules under which we have been operating as it concerns \nmergers in this area. I think turning over the power to the Department \nof Justice and changing the criteria that are being used for antitrust \npurposes would not be a very good thing for us to do, and there is no \nreason to do it. We are talking about saving money here. We are talking \nabout doing away with the duplication of administration. I do not think \nwe have to also change all of the rules and the precedents that have \nbeen set for the last 70 years in railroad mergers.\n  There are many people who have legitimate concerns about some of the \nrailroad mergers that are being considered right now. But these were \nbrought into play before we brought this bill to the floor. And I think \nto change the rules is not necessary, nor desirable. I think we have \nthe capabilities to judge any mergers. We have the ability to judge the \nissues under the standards that we have had before in transferring that \nto the Department of Transportation.\n  The second reason I think it is important to keep the standards we \nhave is that the Department of Transportation and the new Board that \nwill be created will have the transportation background. They will \nspecialize in this area. That will be their area of expertise and \nconcern. I do not think it does us any good to go to the Department of \nJustice, which has so many other areas of interest, and I do not think \nthat having this transfer does anything for the merits of the issue, \nand it could hurt by changing precedent that has been in place.\n  One of the things that is so important in our judicial system is the \nvalue of precedent. We place a great deal of emphasis on being able to \ndetermine from what has happened in the past what will be allowed in \nthe future. That is one of the ways that businesses make their \ndecisions. They would look at a merger, they would look at a precedent, \nand they would make a business decision if this is something that would \ngo through and what the concerns would be.\n  I think it is important we keep that value of precedent so that we \nwill have an orderly business climate that allows people to make good \nbusiness decisions without disrupting 70 years of precedent in this \narea.\n  So I hope that we can defeat the Dorgan amendment and stick with the \ncommittee bill. I think it is a good bill. It has many merits. It is \ncertainly going to save money.\n  We are on the road to eliminating the ICC because it is not \nnecessary. Let us not throw out the value of what has gone on in the \npast just because we are putting it into a more efficient system. I \nthink it could cost us much more in the long run and certainly cost \ncompetitiveness and cost to customers if we increase the regulatory \nenvironment and therefore cause people to have to raise prices. So I \nhope we can defeat this amendment, and I yield the floor.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be \nrecognized as if in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/11/28/senate-section/article/S17584-2", "month": "11", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "28", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S17590-S17592]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   SENDING AMERICAN TROOPS TO BOSNIA\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I feel compelled today to make a couple of \nstatements about the President's message last night.\n  I am very disturbed at what is happening, and I think all of America \nneeds to know what is going on. I commend the President on giving a \nbeautiful, persuasive speech, as he is very good at doing. However, I \nsuggest, Mr. President, that as we are speaking now and as time is \ncreeping by, our troops are on their way to Bosnia.\n  It is my understanding that the distinguished Senator from Colorado, \nwho will be here in just a moment, made a trip over Thanksgiving, which \nis essentially the same trip I made the week before, into the northeast \nsector of Bosnia, which is the area where our troops are going to be. A \nnumber of people have gone over to Bosnia but have not gone beyond \nSarajevo and do not really have a feel for the environment in which our \nPresident has this obsession of sending our American troops.\n  Mr. President, last night he talked about morality and about what our \nmoral obligation is in Bosnia, and the fact that we have a moral \nobligation to see how many people we are going to be able to save from \nthe brutality that could be taking place there.\n\n  He talked about our commitment to NATO. And I would like to throw out \na couple of ideas, a couple of thoughts. Mr. President, when I went to \nSarajevo it was the middle of a blizzard, a snowstorm. We had a hard \ntime getting up there. There were not any Americans up there. There \nwere not any Americans going to the northeast sector, that area around \nthe Posavina corridor and Tuzla, and south of Hungary, which is an area \nwhere our troops are going to be deployed from the lst Armored Division \nwhere they are being trained for this kind of deployment. And that may \nbe happening and is happening, I suggest, as we speak.\n  I heard several people say that we need to wait until we have \nhearings and let some time go by. But each hour that goes by, the \nAmerican people need to know the President has a strategy to get our \ntroops over there, to put us in a position where we are going to have \nto, by denying the authorization of sending troops into Bosnia on the \nground, we are turning our backs on troops who are already there. And \nthis is a position that we are now getting into. And each hour that \ngoes by we are getting in deeper and deeper.\n  I can recall not being able to get up there until General Rupert \nSmith, who is the successor of Michael Rose as the commander there of \nthe U.N. forces in Bosnia, he agreed to take me up. And as we went up \nwe went over almost every square mile of that area that is called the \nnortheast sector, where our troops are going to be deployed, not more \nthan 100 feet off the ground--because I have a background in aviation, \n\n[[Page S 17591]]\nI know we were not anywhere higher than that--we were in the middle of \na blizzard.\n  Mr. President, this is not the Rocky Mountains we are talking about. \nThis is an area of cliffs and caves. For the first time I could see why \nduring the Second World War that they were able to withstand the very \nbest that Hitler had to offer on a ratio of 1 to 8 because of the very \nunique geography we are dealing with.\n  As I looked down I thought, there are not any roads down there, there \nare not any valleys, not the traditional valleys that you would have in \nthe terrain that we think of as being mountainous terrain. And so all \nthese tanks and all these armored vehicles would not really have any \nway to maneuver in that area.\n  And, Mr. President, I think the President of the United States is \nputting us in a position where it is going to be too late. You know, we \ncould come back and talk about whether or not we should send troops \nover, whether or not there are strategic interests as far as our \nNation's security is concerned. And by that time, we are going to have \nour troops over there.\n  I think the President is looking at--he has been talking about 20,000 \nor 25,000 troops for so long now, for 2 years, I think it is an \nobsession with him. He is no longer thinking of them as being faces of \nreal human beings. I think it is a faceless gesture when he says, we \nwant to send 20,000 American troops into Bosnia.\n  But I went up to where the lst Armored Division was training these \nyoung men and women who will be the first to go, who I suggest--I had \nbreakfast with many of them in the mess hall. And they are on their way \nto Bosnia right now as we speak. And those individuals all asked me, \n``What is our mission? We don't understand what our mission is.'' Of \ncourse, I tried to be as optimistic as possible. I said, ``We're always \nbehind our troops. Whatever happens, we're going to be supporting our \ntroops.'' But as far as the mission is concerned, I do not know what \nthe mission is.\n\n  In the speech last night the President kept using the term over and \nover again--he said, ``The mission is clear and limited.'' But he never \nsaid what the mission was. It is a humanitarian mission. And I think we \nhave about half the world that is covered with problems, with ethnic \ncleansing, with human rights violations. I am not sure whether we feel \nthat we--or the President feels that we--have the resources and the \nmilitary assets to go out and take care of all these problems. \nObviously, we do not. We are operating on a defense budget now that is \ndown comparable to what it was in 1980 when it could not afford spare \nparts. Yet we are taking on all these humanitarian problems around the \nworld.\n  I had occasion to talk to James Tayrien. James Tayrien is from \nPoteau, OK. He would be one of the first ones to go. I came home and \ntalked to his mother, Estella, down in Poteau. She asked me the same \nquestion. I cannot answer it. It is very easy to get engaged in these \nthings and send troops in, but it is hard to bring them out.\n  Look at Vietnam. It was very easy to send them in. Look at the other \ncases that we have. Mission creep. If there was ever a classical \nenvironment for mission creep, that is it over in Bosnia. In fact, we \nhave already crept. The mission was to be peacekeeping. Now it is peace \nimplementation. There is a big difference, Mr. President, between \npeacekeeping and peace implementation. Peace implementation is the \nrecognition there is no peace to keep right now.\n  The President last night said, of course, the war is over. The war is \nnot over. We went up there. We were in Tuzla. We could hear the firing, \nthe firepower that was going on. It has not stopped. And we are dealing \nwith three major factions over there. And I suggest to you that one of \nthe factions was not in Dayton, OH. Milosevic does not speak for the \nBosnian Serbs.\n  It was my experience--and I see the distinguished Senator from \nColorado is here. He is the only other Senator or House Member, to my \nknowledge, who has been in the northeast sector, in the Tuzla area. The \npoint I am trying to get across here is that those people who are \naround that peace table are not speaking for the factions that were \nfiring guns as we were up there just a couple weeks ago.\n\n  I mean, they are up there. They could be Croats. They could be Serbs. \nThey could be Bosnian Serbs. They could be Moslems. We do not know who \nthey are. They could be any of these rogue factions. We hear a lot \nabout the major factions that are over there. We know that three major \nfactions have fired on their own troops just to blame the other side \nfor sympathy. Anyone with that mentality is going to be firing on \nAmerican troops. But we do not say anything about the other rogue \nfactions, such as the Black Swans, the Arkan Tigers. We have Iranians. \nWe have all kinds of factions up there, more than just three major \nfactions.\n  I would like to ask the Senator from Colorado, if that is the same \nenvironment as I have just explained that he experienced just this past \nweek? I am sure he would have rather been doing something else on \nThanksgiving. But it is my understanding he was up in that northeast \nsector during Thanksgiving. Is that correct?\n  Mr. BROWN. I did. We had taken a plane, U.N. plane into Sarajevo and \ngot a U.N. crew, a Norwegian helicopter crew, to take us in that \nregion. And we did a flyover over much of that area. I must say the \nSenator's description is right on.\n  What I found was in that area that is absolutely ideal in terms of \nguerrilla warfare. What I was surprised to find, and I think Members \nmay be surprised to find, is that the plan is not to set up a border \nand patrol of that border. In other words, in fact, they indicated many \nof these areas where the line has been drawn, it simply does not even \ncorrespond to things on the ground. It is not the peak of a hill or the \ndepth of a valley or the flow of a river. It is a line on the map that \nhas not been translated on the ground.\n  And their plan is not to erect a fence or even to check people coming \nacross. There would be free flow of people across it. But I found very \nrugged terrain, and I found the roads that were there were very narrow, \nand very heavy timber cover so that it would be very difficult to spot \nthings from the air. And it would be almost impossible to get our \narmored personnel carriers and our armored vehicles, tanks, into full \nplay in that region. It is as difficult a situation from a terrain \npoint of view as I have seen almost anywhere.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Let me ask the Senator from Colorado, since this was \nabout a 10-day period between the time I was in the northeast sector of \nBosnia, south of the Posavina pass and south of Hungary and north of \nTuzla, if he did have occasion to speak to any of those who were in \ncommand up in Tuzla, such as General Haukland?\n  Mr. BROWN. I did talk to the Norwegian general. He said he would be \nrelieved when the U.S. troops came in. I also talked to Gen. Rupert \nSmith in charge of the U.N. forces there, as well as a discussion at \nthe Embassy with all the U.S. forces. As the Senator knows, there is a \nnumber of U.S. military personnel who are stationed in Sarajevo. They \nindicated a couple of things. One, none of them expected this to be \nwound up within a year.\n  Mr. INHOFE. This is the question I was going to ask the Senator. Even \nlast night we talked about 12 months.\n  When the Senator and I sat next to each other at the Senate Armed \nServices Committee, when we had Secretary Perry and General \nShalikashvili, and we asked the question that they had written up, \n``Are you going to commit yourself to 12 months, to a time period after \nwhich we withdraw and we come back?'' they said, ``Yes, we are \nabsolutely committed to that.''\n  Did you find anyone, who were the military people, either with NATO, \nthe United Nations, with any of our NATO partners, or anyone up there \nin the Tuzla area who felt there is even a remote idea or notion we \ncould be out of there in a 12-month period as far as achieving peace?\n  Mr. BROWN. I talked to Norwegian personnel, military personnel from \nIceland.\n  There were doctors there from Sweden. I talked to a general from \nGreat Britain. I talked to U.S. military personnel. I talked to Embassy \npersonnel. I talked to Bosnian officials. Nobody, not anyone, none of \nthem thought this mission could be achieved or completed within a year. \n\n\n[[Page S 17592]]\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. That is exactly what they thought 10 days prior to that \ntime. I have these horrible visions of what happened with Somalia. I \ncan remember when we were trying to bring our troops back from Somalia, \nand we sent resolutions to President Clinton month after month to bring \nour troops back from there.\n  It was not until 18 of our Rangers were murdered and the mutilated \ncorpses were dragged through the streets of Mogadishu that the American \npeople finally woke up and said, ``We want them back. We don't have \nstrategic interests there that are worth this kind of a sacrifice.'' I \nsee similar things like this are happening over there.\n  When you talk about the morality of the issue and the fact that we \nare, in a sense, rewarding those individuals who are guilty of the most \nserious war crimes, because we are now saying we are on their side and \nwe are doing this, this is something that I think we need to talk about \nbefore a decision is made that we are going to go along with this, \nbecause I see that happening.\n  I see discussions taking place in this Chamber and outside the \nChamber, ``Well, let's wait until we have some hearings. Let's wait \nuntil this,'' and as this is happening, our troops are being deployed \nover there.\n  Mr. BROWN. Let me say to the Senator, if I can, in response, I think \nit is very analogous to what happened in Somalia in this respect: There \nis not a clear military plan. There is not a clear plan as to what we \nare going to do once we are there.\n  For example, one of the things you could do is put up a fence and man \na border. That is not what they plan to do. One of the things you can \ndo is you can stop people from moving from one side of a border to \nanother, stemming terrorism, guns, ammunition. That is not what they \nplan to do. When I asked what they do plan to do with the troops there, \nthere was no clear answer by anyone.\n  The reality is, the President is committing troops to that area for \nshow. There is no clear military plan, and there is no clear, effective \nway to defend or protect those troops.\n  I might say, it is cold as can be right now in Bosnia. There is no \nstructure there for our troops to stay in. There is no structure there \nfor our troops to stay in. There is no supply of clean, healthful \nwater. There are no normal sanitary conditions. There is no established \nsupply line at this point. I suspect there will be at some point in the \nfuture. But this is a catastrophe in the making, and I believe it shows \na reckless disregard for those who serve our country.\n\n  I think we have an obligation to people who put on the uniform of \nthis Nation. You can agree or disagree with the mission, you can agree \nor disagree with the personalities, but we have an obligation when \nsomeone comes and puts on the uniform of the United States to make sure \nthat we do not endanger their life without a real purpose.\n  Some will say we should not endanger their life. If you are not \nwilling to put your life on the line, you should not be in the \nmilitary. I understand how these men and women would risk their lives, \nand our freedom is important enough to do that. But, Mr. President, and \nI say to the Senator from Oklahoma, keeping our prestige high or \navoiding an embarrassment because someone made a commitment they should \nnot have is not a reason to commit American troops to a situation where \nthey cannot defend themselves or cost American lives.\n  We have an obligation to people who put on that uniform to stand \nbeside them and do all we can to protect them, and it is very clear--it \nis very clear--that we are not able to do that in this circumstance, \nand, moreover, we have not even supplied them with a purpose or a \nreason for them to sacrifice their lives.\n  If they were there to defend freedom, I think the Senator from \nOklahoma and I would be right there with them to stand behind them and \nsupport them and to encourage this action to stand up for freedom. But \nthis is not that effort. This is an effort to save face in the world \ncommunity, and I think it is much more important to stand behind our \ntroops.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Let me ask the Senator from Colorado----\n  Mr. PRESSLER. If my friends will yield for a split moment, we are \ntrying to get a vote ordered at 5:15, and I have to make a unanimous \nconsent request. If I can do that, then you can go back into your mode, \nbecause they are going to hotline this.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I yield to the Senator.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/11/28/senate-section/article/S17590-1", "month": "11", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "28", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S17592]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 INTERSTATE COMMERCE COMMISSION SUNSET\n\n  The Senate continued with the consideration of the bill.\n\n\n                      Unanimous-Consent Agreement\n\n  Mr. PRESSLER.

Yes.\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Why do you not offer it at 5 to 5?\n  Mrs. BOXER. So I will get it before the vote on the Dorgan amendment?\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Yes. I amend that by saying at the hour of 4:55 p.m., \nthe Senator from California will offer her amendment, and then at 5 \no'clock we divide up the time.\n  I want everybody to speak as much as they wish.\n  Mrs. BOXER.

Mr. President, just a couple of other things I wanted to \nask the Senator from Colorado.\n  In that there is a 10-day timeframe from the time he came back and \nthe time I was over in that area, a concern was expressed to me at that \ntime--and keeping in mind that the lines we have now seen on the map \nnear Tuzla, which I am sure the Senator has had a chance to discuss, \nthere is a problem that there are approximately 3 million refugees, if \nyou count them from all throughout that area that those lines on the \nmap are going to preclude at that time, they said more than 50 percent \nof them would not be able to return to their homelands.\n  Their concern was that this is going to increase the number of rogue \nelements that were there, that anyone who thinks there is a peace \naccord, first thing a refugee wants to do is go home. The fact that \nthey would not be able to return home would increase the number of \nrogue elements that are around or that join other elements.\n  The second thing is their concern over what we refer to, and the \nadministration refers to, has never really been defined as systematic \nviolations. There are two ways we can get out of this. One is, 12 \nmonths goes by; and the other is if there is a systematic violation, \nmeaning one of the major factions \n\n[[Page S 17593]]\nis violating the peace accord or whatever accord it is they have \ninitialed and they are proposing to sign.\n  The fact that there is no way for the military, the soldier in the \nfield, to know if there is an uprising of some type or a conflict, \nwhether that is a systematic violation or maybe just some rogue element \nthat is firing upon troops--did they express that concern when you were \nthere?\n  Mr. BROWN. Those concerns were expressed, and added to this is the \nfact that the border will be free flowing. You will not have an \ninterdiction at the border. It will be very difficult to tell if the \npeople coming across the border are refugees and allowed to go back to \nan area that has changed hands, or if they are terrorists, or if they \nare a military element.\n  They also expressed great concern about a couple of other aspects. \nOne was a conviction on the part of the military personnel that I \ntalked to--U.S. military personnel--that none of the parties would \nabide. When I asked, they said, ``Look, the normal pattern here is \npeople sign agreements and then when spring comes, they go ahead and \nproceed with their plans afoot.'' Frankly, our people who are on the \nground were very skeptical that you would see any of the three parties \nfollow these agreements.\n\n  The problem, of course, is that you have U.S. military personnel in a \nposition that is very difficult to defend in between them at a point \nthey have wholesale violations of the peace agreements.\n  At this point, it is very difficult for me to see what it is U.S. \npersonnel accomplish in that area, other than being targets.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Certainly in a 12-month period, if we are, in fact, \ncommitted to a timeframe--and I do not know from my reading and, of \ncourse, my experience in the military, of any time we have gone into \nhostile conflict with a time-oriented departure--it is always a \nfunction or an action, something that has taken place.\n  It was General Huptmann, I believe, who used this analogy, and maybe \nhe used it with you. He said, ``Twelve months is like putting your hand \nin water for 12 months and you take it out and look down and nothing \nhas changed.'' Twelve months in the Balkans does not mean anything. If \nwe are going to be out in 12 months, those individuals that would be \nwarring factions would be in a position to start up again.\n  Mr. BROWN. One thing I might say, it will mean the expenditure of \n$1.5 billion to perhaps $3 billion. I say to the Senator, I suspect \nthis body will face supplemental appropriation requests from the \nadministration that exceed those numbers.\n  There simply is no way to put down the 20,000 people they are talking \nabout in that region, or perhaps 25,000 they have talked about--my \nguess is it may be the higher figure--without the expenditures of huge \namounts of money in roads, in clearing areas, in some sort of quarters \nfor the personnel that will be there, and the whole infrastructure they \nare talking about as a backup.\n  What will be different 12 months from now is an enormous expenditure \nof U.S. Treasury in taxpayers' money on an enterprise that does not \nhave a defined function or a defined date of accomplishment.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I think the Senator from Colorado is being very \nconservative when he quotes the figures of the administration of $1.5 \nto $2 billion. I have seen figures up to $4.5 to $6 billion.\n  I recall not too many weeks ago the administration came to this body \nfor a $1.4 billion supplemental appropriation to take care of some of \nthe past humanitarian gestures that were forecast to cost a third or a \nfourth of that amount. It is hard to talk about dollars when we are \ntalking about human lives.\n  My concern is if we are concerned, as the President indicated he was \nlast night, about NATO and the integrity of NATO, where is NATO going \nto be if we go in there and start this thing, the body bags start \ncoming back to America and people start getting concerned as they were \nas the incidents of Mogadishu? Then we cut and run, which surely we \nwould do at that time. Then, where is NATO and the integrity of NATO?\n  Mr. BROWN. I think the Senator has put his finger on the entire \nproblem. Before we commit U.S. troops to a role where they are in \ndanger, the Weinberger rules of engagement, I think, provide a good \nbasis.\n  It seems to me for every American, just simple and basic \nunderstanding, before you send troops into combat, you ought to have a \nclearly defined military mission that is accomplishable, and without \nthat, they should not go.\n  What we are literally seeing is the use of U.S. troops as \ninternational social workers. The fact is, U.S. armed services \npersonnel ought to be used as soldiers to accomplish a military \nmission. That is what they are trained for. That is what they are \naccomplished at. That is what they are good at.\n  For U.S. troops to be used in this function without a clear mission, \nat least in this Senator's view, is an invitation to a tragedy of the \nfirst order.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I am very much concerned about it, and I know we are \nusing up more time than we should.\n  Let me just conclude and speak only for myself. I have listened to \nthe President. I thought the President would come out with something \nnew that has not already been part of the debate. There was not one new \nargument or element introduced into the debate in the President's \nstatement last night.\n  In the absence of that, knowing that each hour that goes by the \nPresident is deploying more Americans into that hostile area, I have to \nget on record right here in this body, Mr. President, as saying I will \nfight with every fiber of my being to stop the President from sending \ntroops in on the ground into Bosnia.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/11/28/senate-section/article/S17592-2", "month": "11", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "28", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S17593-S17601]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                INTERSTATE COMMERCE COMMITTEE SUNSET ACT\n\n  The Senate continued with the consideration of the bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk, and I ask \nfor its consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from California [Mrs. Boxer], for herself, Mr. \n     Harkin, Mr. Bryan, Mr. Bumpers, and Mr. Feingold, proposes an \n     amendment numbered 3065.\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place in the bill, insert the following \n     section:\n\n     SEC.  . PAY OF MEMBERS OF CONGRESS AND THE PRESIDENT DURING \n                   GOVERNMENT SHUTDOWNS.\n\n       (a) Comparable Pay Treatment.--The pay of members of \n     Congress and the President shall be treated in the same \n     manner and to the same extent as the pay of the most \n     adversely affected federal employees who are not compensated \n     for any period in which appropriations lapse.\n       (b) This section shall take effect December 15, 1995.\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, the purpose of the amendment I have sent \nto the desk which is sponsored by myself, Mr. Harkin, Mr. Bryan, Mr. \nBumpers, and Mr. Feingold, simply says that Members of Congress and the \nPresident should be treated the same way as other Federal employees \nduring a shutdown, a partial shutdown, during any period where there is \na lapse in appropriations.\n  Now, Mr. President, the Senate has passed it a couple of times, but I \nhope it was not a sham when everyone said, ``Yes, we are for it,'' take \nit by voice vote. We put it on the D.C. appropriations bill. It seems \nto be stuck there. The other times we passed it, it has not seen the \nlight of day.\n  I have been around here long enough to know when I am getting conned. \nThis is not happening. Everyone says they are for it, it passes here, \nand it has not really gone to the President's desk. He supports it.\n  The reputation of this Congress is at a very low point. The approval \nrating of this Congress is in the 20's. I submit that one of the \nreasons, first of all, was the fact that there was a Government \n\n[[Page S 17594]]\nshutdown, that we could not get our job done. We failed.\n  This Congress did not get the appropriation bills out to the \nPresident. This Congress could not even pass a clean debt extension. \nChaos is the name of the game around here.\n  During the Government shutdown, we know there was a lot of angst, \nanxiety, to Federal workers, for people who needed the Federal \nGovernment, for people who want to go to the parks, for veterans who \ncould not get help, for new Social Security applicants who wanted to \nfile their papers, but no sacrifice around here. Our own staff was not \ngetting paid, but we were getting paid. No problem.\n  Yes, some Members of Congress felt bad about it and gave some money \nto charity. Some did not take their checks. Some gave their money back \nto the Treasury. But this was an institutional failure, Mr. President.\n  There was a poll done in San Francisco, a place that believes there \nis a very important need for a national Government, and 89 percent of \nthe people responding to the poll of the San Francisco Examiner said \nCongress should not get paid unless they do their work.\n  What could be more fundamental than making sure that appropriation \nbills move forward or, in lieu thereof, a continuing resolution that \nkeeps this Government running?\n  Now, Mr. President, we have deep divisions in this body on Federal \npriorities. The Republicans have laid out their budget. It is clear. \nMr. President, $270 billion cuts in Medicare, huge cuts in Medicaid, \neducation, the environment. The President says, ``No way.'' We will \nbalance the budget in 7 years, we all agreed, but we need to take a \nbetter look at priorities.\n  Well, that is all well and good, but the fact is we should not be \nplaying games with people's lives, and if we do, we should get \npenalized just as other Federal employees would.\n  So we have our disagreements on the level of spending, but we should \nstill get to work, get some compromises going, and move forward as a \nNation.\n  So we have not passed the Boxer-Durbin bill. It is stuck in all sorts \nof committees. I intend to offer it every single chance I get, on every \nsingle bill that I can. I intend to get a vote on it. I will be \npersistent, and I know around here persistence is looked at in two \nways: Some people love it, other people hate it. They especially like \nit if they agree with you; and if they do not, they hate it. But I am \ngoing to be persistent on this. I have been persistent on other things \naround here. And I will say this. This bill makes eminent sense. Let me \nread it to you. As an amendment it says:\n\n       The pay of members of Congress and the President shall be \n     treated in the same manner and to the same extent as the pay \n     of the most adversely affected federal employees who are not \n     compensated for any period in which appropriations lapse.\n       This section shall take effect December 15, 1995.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Boxer amendment \nwill be set aside.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Thank you very much, Mr. President, for your patience.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3064\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate will resume deliberation of the \nDorgan amendment.\n  Who yields time?\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Mr. President, I yield myself 2 minutes to say I urge \nall Senators to vote against the Dorgan amendment. We have taken care \nof the problems which the Senator from North Dakota raised in this \nbill. This is a carefully crafted bill which Senator Exon and I and \nothers have worked out over months of negotiation and this is \nunnecessary additional regulation. I rise in strong opposition to the \nDorgan amendment. I urge all Senators to vote against it.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time and, Mr. President, I suggest the \nabsence of a quorum and I ask unanimous consent that time be charged \nequally.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Abraham). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that it be in order \nfor me to offer an amendment at this time and to have it voted on \nimmediately following the vote on the amendment by Mr. Dorgan.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Mr. President, reserving the right to object--and I do \nnot want to object--some of the Members may want to have a chance to \nspeak on the amendment. I am trying to find a way here to cooperate \nquickly. But we do not know what the amendment is.\n  Mr. BYRD. Very well. The Senator makes a good point.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that it may be in order for me \nto offer my amendment at this time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3066\n\n(Purpose: To provide for a minimum penalty of 30 years of imprisonment \n  and a maximum penalty of life imprisonment for the destruction of a \n  motor vehicle or motor vehicle facility if a motor vehicle carrying \n  high level nuclear waste or spent nuclear fuel is involved, or for \nwrecking or sabotaging a train that carries high level nuclear waste or \n                          spent nuclear fuel)\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, today we are considering S. 1396, the \nInterstate Commerce Commission Sunset Act of 1995. For over a century, \nthe ICC has protected shippers from unfair competition and monopolistic \npricing by the railroad and trucking industries. The bill before us \nreflects the deregulation of the transportation industry, and the \ndeclining need for many of the functions of the ICC. But, even as we \nconsider the changing nature of transportation, we must also consider \nthat new threats have emerged against shippers and the Nation's rail \nand trucking industries. Those threats are not in the indirect form of \npredatory price gouging, but rather manifest themselves as direct acts \nof violence and terrorism that threaten innocent bystanders.\n  We are considering this bill in the wake of the sabotage of the \nSunset Limited in the Arizona desert on October 10. That derailment is \nthe latest act of terrorism against the American people, following on \nthe bombings of the World Trade Center in New York City and the Federal \nbuilding in Oklahoma City. When the ICC was first created, such acts of \nviolence were unknown.\n  Today, we must act to deter terrorism, and in so doing, must think \nthe unthinkable--namely, that a terrorist could target a shipment of \nthe most lethal of all possible cargoes, high level nuclear waste. This \nis the most toxic substance known to mankind. Exposure to even the \nsmallest amount--amounts so small that you could not see it--would \nresult in death. High level nuclear waste is not simply lethal, but \nalso long lasting. It can take up to a quarter of a million years for \nthis waste to fully decay, and lose its lethal radioactive character.\n  My amendment would increase the penalties for an act of sabotage \nagainst a train or motor vehicle carrying spent nuclear fuel or high \nlevel nuclear waste. Current Federal law stipulates that the penalty \nfor an act of sabotage against a train or motor vehicle is a maximum of \n20 years--which means they could be given 5 years, or 10 years, or 2 \nyears--or in the event of a fatality, a minimum of life imprisonment or \nthe death penalty. Therefore, a terrorist who targets a train or truck \ncarrying high level nuclear waste, but who fails in his mission to \nspread this poisonous radioactive contamination, might receive \nconsiderably less than 20 years in prison.\n  Under my amendment, any individual who commits a ``willful'' or \ndeliberate act of sabotage against a train or motor vehicle used in \ninterstate commerce transporting high level nuclear waste or spent \nnuclear fuel would receive a minimum penalty of 30 years to life. The \ncurrent provision of law regarding a fatality would remain in effect.\n  My amendment is necessary because shipments of nuclear waste and \nspent fuel are already occurring. Furthermore, there is the possibility \nof a significant increase in the number of such shipments within the \nnext few years. If that should occur, there would be increased public \nattention focused on \n\n[[Page S 17595]]\nthese shipments. The public would be aware that, under my amendment, \nany act of sabotage would receive the certain and minimum penalty of 30 \nyears imprisonment.\n  Past shipments of nuclear waste have crossed through the majority of \nour States, including my own State of West Virginia. These shipments \ntraveled on many of the primary routes of interstate commerce, and \npassed within close proximity to major urban areas, and millions of \nAmerican homes. Thus far, we have been lucky, with no recorded acts of \nsabotage against these shipments. But the possibility has always been \npresent, since this toxic cargo is carried by both rail and truck.\n  From 1979-1994, there were 1,282 separate shipments of commercial \nspent nuclear fuel. Ninety percent of these shipments traveled on the \nNation's highways, with only 10 percent traveling by rail. And it is \nimportant to note that this figure does not include classified \nshipments of high level nuclear waste from Department of Energy or \nmilitary facilities, although my amendment covers those shipments, as \nwell.\n  Even though more trucks were involved in this commerce than trains, \nover 70 percent of the total volume of radioactive waste was carried by \nrail. And, this volume could dramatically increase before the end of \nthis century. Current plans call for this spent nuclear fuel, along \nwith even more high level radioactive waste from Federal facilities, to \nbe deposited in a permanent geologic repository. At the present time, \nYucca Mountain in Nevada is under consideration as such a repository. \nThe Yucca Mountain site is behind schedule, and the site suitability \nstudy is not due to be released until 1998 at the earliest.\n  In the meantime, pending legislation would authorize the construction \nof an ``interim'' storage facility at the Nevada Test Site. This \ninterim storage facility would be used until Yucca Mountain, or an \nalternative site, is approved. I want to emphasize that my amendment \ndoes not address the issues posed by that pending legislation, namely, \nwhether Yucca Mountain, or an interim storage facility, should be made \noperational.\n  My amendment, does, however, address the danger presented by the \ndramatic increase that would occur in the shipments of toxic nuclear \nwaste to either of these facilities. Current proposals call for the \nshipment of 2,000 to 3,000 metric tons per year, from up to 79 \ncommercial nuclear reactor sites that have spent nuclear fuel and waste \nstored on-site. Furthermore, this does not include DOE facilities. The \ninterim site, if it is approved and constructed, would eventually \nreceive up to 100,000 metric tons of spent fuel and high level nuclear \nwaste, pending the opening of a permanent geologic repository.\n  The Department of Energy has not publicly announced which routes will \nbe used in shipments to Yucca Mountain or an interim storage site. \nHowever, these shipments would originate at up to 79 commercial sites, \nas well as Department of Energy facilities, and would therefore likely \ntravel across large sections of our Nation.\n  But our concern should not be only about the routes that will be \nused, but also the sheer number of shipments, and the quantity of \nhighly radioactive waste involved. From 1979 to 1994, a total of one \nton of spent nuclear fuel was shipped in the United States by \ncommercial facilities. These proposals to build an interim or permanent \nnuclear waste facility envision shipments of thousands of tons in a \nsingle year.\n  Again, I am not commenting on whether a permanent waste repository or \ninterim storage facility is needed, or whether such shipments should \noccur. This body has debated that issue in the past, and will do so \nagain in the future.\n  Regardless of how that debate is resolved, the fact remains that we \nare currently shipping the most toxic substance known on our Nation's \nhighways and railroads. And we may dramatically increase those \nshipments in the future. The very least that we can do is to increase \nthe penalty for sabotage against such shipments, in an effort to deter \nsuch acts of terrorism from occurring.\n  Mr. President, I send the amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from West Virginia [Mr. Byrd] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 3066.\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following new section:\n\n     SEC.  . DESTRUCTION OF MOTOR VEHICLES OR MOTOR VEHICLE \n                   FACILITIES; WRECKING TRAINS.\n\n       (a) Destruction of Motor Vehicles or Motor Vehicle \n     Facilities.--Section 33 of the title 18, United States Code, \n     is amended by adding at the end the following new \n     undesignated paragraph:\n       ``Whoever is convicted of a crime under this section \n     involving a motor vehicle that, at the time the crime \n     occurred, carried high-level radioactive waste (as that term \n     is defined in section 2(12) of the Nuclear Waste Policy Act \n     of 1982 (42 U.S.C. 10101(12)), or spent nuclear fuel (as that \n     term is defined in section 2(23) of the Nuclear Waste Policy \n     Act of 1982 (42 U.S.C. 10101(23)), shall be imprisoned for \n     not less than 30 years.''.\n       (b) Wrecking Trains.--Section 1992 of title 18, United \n     States Code, is amended--\n       (1) by inserting after the fourth undesignated paragraph \n     the following:\n       ``Whoever is convicted of any such crime that involved a \n     train that, at the time the crime occurred, carried high-\n     level radioactive waste (as that term is defined in section \n     2(12) of the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982 (42 U.S.C. \n     10101(12)), or spent nuclear fuel (as that term is defined in \n     section 2(23) of the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982 (42 \n     U.S.C. 10101(23)), shall be imprisoned for not less than 30 \n     years.''\n\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Mr. President, I think we very much want to accept the \namendment, and the Senator from West Virginia would like a rollcall \nvote on it immediately following this one. I should be clearing with my \npartner here. But as far as I am concerned we would be delighted to \neither accept it or have a rollcall vote immediately following this \nvote, whichever the Senator prefers.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished manager of the \nbill.\n  I ask for the yeas and nays on the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that this vote \noccur immediately after the vote on the Dorgan amendment which will \noccur momentarily, I understand.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, this \namendment, the Dorgan amendment, was to be debated in this time period. \nThere are some brief points that could be made, and I wonder if the \nfloor manager would include 2 minutes for the proponents and 2 minutes \nfor the opponents so that we may conclude discussion.\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Just to explain, the times were reserved between 5 and \n5:15. Some Senators have to go on to other schedules. We now will have \ntwo rollcall votes starting almost immediately. As far as I am \nconcerned, I would suggest we could yield 2 minutes to the Senator. The \nSenators who had that time were not here. It might inconvenience other \nSenators is my point, but as far as I am concerned, I have no objection \nto 2 minutes being added on at this point.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, and I will \nnot object, would the distinguished manager ask unanimous consent that \nthere be no intervening debate on my amendment and that there be no \namendment to the amendment?\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Yes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  The Senator from Missouri will now proceed to speak for 2 minutes on \nthis amendment, after which there will be two consecutive rollcall \nvotes without there being any discussion in between.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3064\n\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I would ask to be notified when 1 minute is \ngone. I want to give the prime sponsor the final minute.\n  Basically, the amendment by the Senator from North Dakota says that \nthe Clayton Act standards--will there be lessening of competition in \nany line of commerce--be applied to rail mergers. All of us have seen \nthe case in airlines where there is no competition \n\n[[Page S 17596]]\nfrom one nearby city to another and find the cost of that travel is \ngreater than the cost of travel coast to coast. That is because \ncompetition is not in effect.\n  I agree that we ought to get rid of Government regulation, but we \nneed competition to protect the customers in the marketplace, and we \ncan only have competition if the Transportation Board has to apply the \nsame standards to rail mergers it does to other industries.\n  I urge support of the Dorgan amendment. I reserve the remainder of my \ntime.\n  Mr. EXON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. EXON. I ask unanimous consent that I be allowed 2 minutes for \nclosing argument.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, I addressed this amendment earlier, and I \nhope that the Senate will vote it down. It is a violation of the basic \nprinciples that we put together with a near unanimous vote, if not a \nunanimous vote, of the Commerce Committee. This amendment would simply \nplace in the Justice Department a veto over things that should be \nproperly decided by the independent body that used to be the Interstate \nCommerce Commission and now will be a body under the Department of \nTransportation.\n  Once again I say, I think that the Justice Department should be a \nlegal advisor, which they are, in the bill introduced by myself and the \nchairman of the committee, but this is a bad step in the wrong \ndirection, and I hope the Senate will vote it down.\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Mr. President, I move to table the Dorgan amendment, \nand I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There is a \nsufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I might ask the sponsor of the amendment if \nhe wishes additional time.\n  I yield back the remaining time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time for debate having expired, the \nquestion is on agreeing to the motion to table the amendment of the \nSenator from North Dakota. The yeas and nays have been ordered. The \nclerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. LOTT. I announce that the Senator from Virginia [Mr. Warner] is \nnecessarily absent.\n  Mr. FORD.

I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3065\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The pending business is the amendment proposed \nby Mrs. Boxer for herself and Mr. Harkin.\n  The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I am constrained to point out to the \nSenate that article II, section 1, clause 6 of the Constitution states \nvery succinctly:\n\n       The President shall, at stated Times, receive for his \n     Services, a Compensation, which shall neither be encreased \n     nor diminished during the Period for which he shall have been \n     elected. . . .\n\n  In addition to that, the people of the United States have ratified \nthe 27th amendment to the Constitution, which states:\n\n       No law, varying the compensation for the services of the \n     Senators and Representatives, shall take effect, until an \n     election of Representatives shall have intervened.\n\n  I intended to make a point of order that this amendment is \nunconstitutional. In the interests of time, I have been asked not to do \nthat and to permit this amendment to be taken to conference. I want to \nput the Senate on notice that should this provision come back to the \nSenate in a conference report, I shall raise that point of order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I appreciate the fact that the Senator \nfrom Alaska is not going to have us vote on the constitutionality of \nthe amendment that is pending. In fact, we have passed a version of \nthis already at least twice in this U.S. Senate.\n  I think anyone who looks at the legislative history of why we moved \nnot to change pay for Members of Congress until the next election knows \nit was because of pay raises, first.\n  Second, I would point out to my friend that we did talk with many \nvarious attorneys on this--Senate legal counsel, we talked to CRS.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Does the Senator have any such opinion from either of \nthe agencies she just mentioned?\n  Mrs. BOXER. If the Senator will let me finish I will give him a \nsynopsis of what they said and I will be happy to get that to the \nSenator in writing. There is divided opinion on this. It is a gray \narea. If the Senator read this \n\n[[Page S 17597]]\namendment, which I know he has done, there is nothing in this to say we \nare changing the pay. As a matter of fact, if you look at the last \nshutdown, every single Federal employee was made whole. The issue was \nwould they be made whole, and many Senators feel, I think on both sides \nof the aisle, including Senator Snowe from Maine who actually wrote \nthis with me, that it is very important we not treat ourselves in a \ndifferent fashion.\n\n  So, I say to my friend, I will be happy to send him the opinions and \nI will, in fact, monitor this myself. Because, I have to tell my \nfriend, this issue is not getting serious attention. It has been kicked \naround and everyone says what a good idea it is, but it is never \nbecoming law. I will say to my friend, the Senator from Iowa and I are \nvery clearly of a mind that we are going to make this stick. We will \nwork to make this constitutional. We think there is nothing in this \nthat says the pay is changed. We feel there is a way we can even make \nthat point clearer.\n  But I will be glad to furnish my friend with these opinions over the \nnext few days, as we get them, in writing.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. STEVENS addressed chair.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I yield to the Senator from Iowa for a question.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California has the floor.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mrs. BOXER. I will be happy to do so, yes.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I will ask the Senator, since I am a cosponsor of this, \nam I of the understanding--this has passed before, has it not? At least \ntwice before it passed in the Senate?\n  Mrs. BOXER. Actually a harsher version of this has passed twice.\n  Mr. HARKIN. And in both of those cases the President was not \nincluded, was he?\n  Mrs. BOXER. Yes. The President has been included because, when I put \nthis out the first time, the other side made that point. The President \nsaid he wants to be included. As a matter of fact, he thinks that is \nthe appropriate course. And we did put the President in because the \nother side said they would not take it unless the President was in it.\n  Mr. HARKIN. In other words, our friends on the Republican side said \nthey would not take it unless the President was in it and now we are \nhearing the argument from the Republican side it is unacceptable \nbecause the President is in there, is that right?\n  Mrs. BOXER. Yes. It feels like a runaround, to me.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Article II of the Constitution says that the President's \nsalary shall neither be increased nor diminished during the period for \nwhich he shall have been elected. But amendment 27 is much different. \nThe 27th amendment, we all know why that was adopted, and the language \nshows that deals with pay raises. Is that not correct?\n  Mrs. BOXER. I believe that is correct.\n  Mr. HARKIN. That is worded differently than article II of the \nConstitution because it states in there that the pay of Senators and \nRepresentatives, the compensation, shall not be varied during that \nperiod of time.\n  Mrs. BOXER. That is correct.\n  Mr. HARKIN. So there is a difference between the wording of the 27th \namendment and article II.\n  The Senator answered my questions.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. HARKIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, first of all, I want to commend my \ncolleague from California for her excellent work and diligence in \npursuing this important amendment.\n  For the life of me I cannot understand what this is really all about. \nLate last year and earlier this year a hue and cry went up that Members \nof the Senate and the House ought to be treated the same as other \npeople in this country. OSHA laws and all of these other things ought \nto apply to us as well as everyone else so we would know what ordinary \npeople went through. We all voted for that. So we covered the Congress \nwith these laws. I think the people of this country thought that was \nwise.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. HARKIN. Yes, I am delighted to yield.\n  Mr. BYRD. Just to correct the Record, there is one Senator who did \nnot vote for that. That was the Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I think the Record will show that I did not say it was \nunanimous.\n  Mr. BYRD. One Senator, no Member of the House voted against it. One \nMember of the Senate voted against it. I voted against it, and I do not \nregret my vote. I think time will prove me to have been at least \npartially right.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I appreciate that the Senator from West Virginia did not \nvote for it, but we may have a difference of opinion on this since I \nbelieve the Congress should have been covered by the same laws, just \nlike I think this also should cover us the same way.\n\n  I find it more than passing strange that when the Government shuts \ndown, as it recently did, that FBI agents, air traffic controllers, \neven our staff, all of our staff who work here, do not get paid. Most \npeople thought that those who were not essential did not get paid, that \nthe ones that went home did not get paid. I talked to a lot of my \ncolleagues who did not know that those who were essential and went to \nwork every day still did not get paid except for Senators and Members \nof the House.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. HARKIN. Yes, I am glad to yield for a question.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I assume the Senator knows it is because of a law passed \nby this Congress that put that into effect and that it was never \nexercised by any President before, but this President did exercise it. \nThis President did, contrary to what President Carter did in 1977. He \nclosed down the national parks. He closed down the various other \nessentials. But the concept was just to put pressure on Congress.\n  If you want to get into a political argument here, I thought that the \nunderstanding was that we would make a statement, and that if it came \nback I would raise a point of order. If the Senator wants to have this \ndebate now and go into the evening, I am more than willing to get some \ndocuments in here and have the debate now. It was my understanding we \nwould have it, if it came back from the conference.\n  Is what the Senator from Iowa saying is the Senator intends to say \nthat the provisions I have raised do not cover this? I happen to be \nchairman of the Governmental Affairs Committee, and I share the \nSenator's feelings about putting people in the position where they are \neither told to go home or work and not get paid. But that is an act of \nCongress which I would like to get changed.\n  But I do not intend to get beat around the head because I want to \nraise a point of order based on the Constitution of the United States. \nAre we going to have this bill go to conference tonight or are we going \nto have this debate?\n  Mr. HARKIN. I do not know. I cannot answer the Senator's question. I \nknow I want to speak on this. I went to some extent and length to get \nhere to talk on this tonight. I intend to have my say on it. I have the \nfloor, and I intend to speak on it. I do not know how long it is going \nto take me. It may take me just a little bit, but I am going to have my \nsay on it because I feel very strongly about it.\n  Mr. President, once again the people of this country see Congress \nbeing treated differently than other people that work for the Federal \nGovernment. You know when you get laid off of a job and the plant \ncloses down, you do not get paid. We have laws here that say when the \nGovernment closes down and we do not pass the appropriations bills, it \nis not a law. It is basically that we do not have any money to pay \nthem.\n  So I really do not know what law the Senator was talking about. When \nwe do not pass the appropriations bills--and that deadline occurs at \nthe end of the fiscal year and we do not have any money to run the \nGovernment--for those appropriations bills that have not been passed, \nthose agencies shut down unless we have a continuing resolution. When \nthat runs out, then, of course, there is no money to pay it.\n  Well, there is a law that talks about essential personnel who have to \nshow \n\n[[Page S 17598]]\nup. For the life of me, I still do not understand how you can demand \nthat someone come to work every day and still not pay them. I thought \nslavery went out of existence 130 some years ago in this country. I \ntell people this, and they are dumbfounded by it. I say, yes, the \nFederal Government can order people to come to work every day and not \npay them. Imagine that: Order them to come to work and not pay them. \nBut that is exactly what is happening. It is unfair.\n\n  Quite frankly, I think it is unconstitutional. I do not know if \nanyone has ever tested it, but I do not think that is constitutional. \nCertainly, I think it is a violation of civil rights to have someone \ncome to work and say, ``However, you are not being paid for that period \nfor which you work.''\n  So I think that we ought to cover Congress just as well as we cover \nother members of the Federal Government. We passed it two or three \ndifferent times here. It always goes to conference, and then it gets \nlost. We know what kind of game that is. We passed it, and everyone \nsays, ``Oh, yes, I voted to cover Congress just like everybody else, \nbut something happened in that gray mist of the conference committee.''\n  Well, I think the Congressional Accountability Act that we passed is \na good bill. I know the Senator from West Virginia did not think so. \nBut I think the vast majority of Congress obviously did think so. I \nthink it is time that we cover ourselves the same way as other Federal \nworkers. If there is a shutdown in the Government, and the \nappropriations bills have not been passed and other Federal workers are \nnot being paid, whether they come to work or not, then I do not think \nSenators and Congressmen ought to be paid for the same period of time \neither.\n  It is a basic issue of fairness and equity. You can cloak arguments \nin constitutionality. I do not want to violate the Constitution. But I \nthink a clear reading of the 27th amendment and the reading of the \nhistory of the 27th amendment shows clearly that it was not intended to \ncover this. It was only intended to cover pay raises enacted by \nCongress.\n  The Senator from Alaska may have--indeed, I think probably does--a \nvalid point regarding article II of the Constitution. But I do not \nbelieve it is a valid point when it comes to the 27th amendment which \ntalks about Members of the Congress.\n  The continuing resolution I know did stipulate that all Federal \nworkers could be paid in the next pay period.\n  So, again, we have this odd system where we had the Government shut \ndown and no one gets paid. They are not paid, but they are paid later. \nA lot of people get time off but still are going to be paid.\n  We may be facing another shutdown of the Government on December 15. I \ndo not know. I hope not. But we will be in a situation there again \nwhere Federal workers could be told to come to work every day and not \nget paid. When? During the height of the Christmas season when they \nhave their bills to pay and, as I said, earlier, their mortgages to \npay, their car payments to make, and Christmas presents to buy. And, \nyet, we are going to tell them, no, they do not get paid. But that is \nall right; Senators and Congressmen will get paid.\n  It is, Mr. President, a basic issue of fairness and equity. I \ncongratulate the Senator from California for pursuing this, and I am \nproud to be a cosponsor of it. I join with her in saying that, if it \ndoes not make it on this bill, there will be another one and another \none and another one, and we will keep attaching it until finally we get \nsomething that must pass.\n  This is an issue we should not let go of because it has to do, as I \nsaid, with basic fairness and equity. And we should not be treated any \ndifferently than any other Federal worker, I do not care where that \nFederal worker works, for what agency.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I am not going to prolong the debate. \nClearly, it is the intersection of the Antideficiency Act and our \nhaving reached the debt ceiling as enacted by Congress and the failure \nto have appropriations bills all occur at the same time that led to an \nExecutive order of the President instructing Cabinet officers not to \nhave other than essential people work. It was an act of the President \nof the United States himself in signing that Executive order that \nbrought about everything that the Senator from Iowa has just complained \nabout.\n  Now, we would be more than happy in my committee to consider changing \nthe law. I have said before I think it should be changed. And I do not \nsee any reason why we should have a situation such as existed. We are \nnot in a position where we are borrowing money to pay those people, but \nit was just done to put pressure on the Congress.\n  At this time, however, I am not going to raise this point of order, \nbut I again put the Senate on notice if it comes back from conference \nwe will have a debate on the constitutionality and we will let the \nCongress and the Senate in particular determine whether it wants to \nenact an unconstitutional law.\n  I take it without any question that the article II concept applies. \nUnder the 27th amendment to the Constitution, if the Senator from Iowa \nwants to know how that would work, if we have such a collision on \nDecember 15, as we think we will have, and it extends beyond December \n31, the compensation of every Senator in this body would be varied \nbecause he or she would not have been paid the compensation we are \ncommitted to pay him or her for the year of 1995, and this would be a \ndenial of the compensation to a Member of Congress in violation of the \n27th amendment.\n  There may be a way we could do it, and I do not have any problem \nabout doing it right, but it is not to be done by an amendment just \nthrown out in the Chamber every time something comes up to try and make \nthe proposition that this Senate under our majority control is somehow \nor other treating Federal employees different than we are treating \nourselves.\n  That is not true. The laws that we are following were enacted before. \nThe President of the United States followed those laws and signed an \nExecutive order, and that is why people stayed home when they were told \nnot to report to work and we are paying them, as we should, under the \nlaws. But they are not covered by the Constitution as is the President \nof the United States and Members of Congress.\n\n  I would be perfectly willing to continue the debate. I personally \nwould like to vote on the amendment by voice vote, and we will discuss \nit later. But if the Senate wants to get into it, I will get a few \ntomes over here and we will get into chapter and verse of why this is \nunconstitutional legislation.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I am not going to devote chapter and \nverse, and I look forward to working with my friend from Alaska to make \nthis right if he feels it can be improved. I just want to point one \nthing out. This is not something that was just put together. This \nparticular amendment is something I have been working on with my \ncolleagues for a long time because I saw this train wreck coming.\n  A lot of people said, oh, it will never happen; everything will go \nsmoothly. And I said, well, I am concerned because I had heard certain \nstatements made, particularly in the other body, where I felt we were \ngoing to have a train wreck, and at that very moment when I had that \nsense I realized I wanted to make sure Members of Congress were treated \nthe same way as other Federal employees.\n  So I just want to say this is not sloppy work, I do not believe, on \nthe part of Members of this body, including the Senator from Maine [Ms. \nSnowe], who actually really helped to write this. But I will work to \nmake sure that every time we offer this up, because clearly we are \ngoing to have to do it again, we improve it in terms of clarity as far \nas its constitutionality.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. HARKIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I just want the Record to be clear in response to my \nfriend from Alaska. I do not think the Record will show I was saying it \nis because the Republicans are now in the majority. That is not the \nproblem at all. I never said that and the Record will show I never said \nthat. Basically, I have said all along this is an issue of basic \nfairness and equity, and it goes to the heart of whether or not we \nconsider \n\n[[Page S 17599]]\nourselves some sort of different class of people in this country above \neverything else, where we can continue to get paid while other Federal \nworkers do not during a period of time when the Government is shut \ndown. People in this country understand that. I do not care who is in \nthe majority, whether Democrats or Republicans. It is not fair and it \nought not to be done that way. That is my basic point and I will \ncontinue to make that point.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 3065) was agreed to.\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. PRESSLER. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Gorton). The Chair asks that the Record \nshow he opposes the Boxer amendment.\n  Are there further amendments to the bill?\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator \nGrassley be added as a cosponsor to S. 1396.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, the managers' amendment accepted earlier \ntoday to the Interstate Commerce Commission Sunset Act of 1995 will \ngreatly assist Vermont in maintaining its intercity passenger rail \nservice. I want to thank the managers of the bill for working with me \non this important amendment.\n  Almost 1 year ago, residents of Vermont were informed that they would \nlose their passenger rail service. In an effort to cut costs and \nrevitalize our struggling national passenger rail corporation, Amtrak \nannounced a major restructuring. This effort included cutbacks in \nservice, downsized management, streamlined operations, and retirement \nof older equipment. This plan also called for elimination of certain \nroutes, including the Montrealer, which had served Vermont for many \nyears.\n  Ending Vermont's connection to our national passenger rail system \nwould certainly have hurt our small State. An integral component of our \ntransportation infrastructure, Amtrak brought skiers, business people, \nand leaf peepers to our beautiful State. In addition, Amtrak allows \nresidents of Vermont to travel economically to nearby destinations and \nacross the country.\n  In an effort to save this service, I worked with Senator Leahy, \nGovernor Dean, the Vermont State Legislature, and many dedicated \nVermont citizens to develop a plan to continue passenger rail in \nVermont. Amtrak became an active partner in assisting with this goal, \nand early last spring the new Vermonter began service from Washington, \nDC to Burlington, VT.\n  The Vermonter has become a model for how Amtrak and States can work \ntogether to preserve passenger rail service. Monthly ridership on the \nVermonter has increased over 60 percent since April. The train allows \nresidents of New York City to reach the ski slopes of Vermont in a few \nhours. A baggage car was added to the train, with state-of-the-art ski \nand bike racks designed by Vermont crafts people and Vermont-made food \nproducts are served in the dining car. Vermonter's are proud of this \ntrain and we will do all we can to see it survive for the long term.\n  The plan establishing the Vermonter required the State of Vermont to \npay any costs over and above the revenue generated by the train. For \n1995, the State agreed to pay $750,000 to support the train. Like all \nStates, Vermont responsibly maintains a balanced budget. This task is \nbecoming more and more difficult, as there are increasing demands on \nthe State to provide services.\n  To assist States such as Vermont, Senator Roth offered an amendment \nto the National Highway System Designation Act, NHS, which would have \ngranted States the flexibility to use highway funds to support Amtrak \nservice. This effort had the strong backing of many State legislatures \nand the National Governors Association. When brought to a vote in June, \nthe amendment passed by an overwhelming margin here in the Senate, \ngiving States hope for preserving their passenger rail service. \nHowever, during conference negotiations on the NHS bill, Senate leaders \nwere forced by the House to drop this important provision.\n  My amendment will allow Vermont to use unobligated highway funds to \npay its portion of the Vermonter's operating costs. In fiscal year \n1996, Vermont will obtain over $71 million under the Federal-aid \nhighway program. This funding comes from the highway trust fund, paid \nfor by motor fuel taxes. Vermonter's pay into the trust fund each time \nthey fill their cars with gasoline. I believe these same Vermonters \nwould strongly support using this funding to maintain our passenger \nrail service.\n  All States should be granted this flexibility, and the success in \nutilizing this flexibility in Vermont should prove to skeptics the \nvalue of giving all States the authority to spend their Federal \ntransportation dollars to support passenger rail.\n  Mr. President, I hope in the future we are successful in providing \nthis flexibility to all States. But for now, without the authority \nprovided by my amendment, Vermont may risk losing the Vermonter. This \nwould be a tragedy.\n  I thank my colleagues for considering this provision, and I \nappreciate their support.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, throughout this Congress, a great deal of \ndiscussion has been devoted to a review of existing agencies and \nfunctions. The budget resolution and the Department of Transportation \nappropriations bill called for the elimination of the Interstate \nCommerce Commission. S. 1396 sunsets the Interstate Commerce Commission \nand the Federal Maritime Commission and creates a new intermodal board \nwithin the Department of Transportation. I believe S. 1396 has taken \nthe right steps to provide for reform while retaining a competitive \natmosphere for railroad, motor carrier, and shipping industries.\n  I have been a strong proponent over the years for rail reform that \nprovides an atmosphere for a strong rail industry as well as retaining \na competitive balance for small shippers. I am particularly concerned \nabout the impact of changes upon small shippers, including the small \ngrain handlers, shippers and processors of Kansas and the Midwest.\n  The legislation before us retains important provisions that have been \nprovided in the past to small shippers while reducing unnecessary \nregulatory requirements. I believe S. 1396 more adequately addresses \nthe concern of small shippers by providing common carrier obligations, \nprotections on agriculture contracting authority, notice procedures for \nrate increases, and abandonment procedures. In addition, protections \nare provided for individuals who lose their jobs due to mergers or \nacquisitions. For these reasons, S. 1396 has gained bipartisan support \nand deserves passage.\n  The railroad industry is going through some interesting times. The \nBurlington Northern/Santa Fe merger coupled with the proposed Union \nPacific/Southern Pacific merger has created concern about the impact of \nthese mergers on shippers. Shippers face unique challenges as railroads \nmerge, creating less options and uncertain futures. Under these \ncircumstances, it becomes increasingly important to ensure an \natmosphere where economically viable competition is allowed to exist. \nThe mergers being proposed are of great concern for several States, \nincluding Kansas. I believe these mergers can accomplish a strong base \nfor the various industries and small businesses they serve, however, \nthe impacts of the merger must be closely monitored. The reduction in \nthe overall number of railroads should not mean a reduction in services \nto those who depend on these services the most.\n  I would like to thank Senator Pressler and Senator Exon for their \nefforts on this legislation and urge your support.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise in support of the Interstate \nCommerce Commission Sunset Act, and I would like to thank the chairman, \nthe Senator from South Dakota [Mr. Pressler], for his interest in, and \nassistance, in putting language in the bill that addresses the serious \nproblem of trucker fatigue.\n  The bill would place the Federal Highway Administration [FHWA] on a \ntime line for publishing regulations related to trucker fatigue. The \npurpose of \n\n[[Page S 17600]]\nthis language is to move the decisionmaking process forward.\n  What this language in section 216 will do is require FHWA to issue an \nadvanced notice of proposed rulemaking [ANPR] dealing with fatigue-\nrelated issues such as 8 hours of continuous sleep after 10 hours of \ndriving, loading and unloading operations, and rest and recovery cycles \nno later than March 1, 1996. This would be followed by a notice of \nproposed rulemaking [NPR] within 1 year and a final rulemaking within 2 \nyears.\n  It is estimated, Mr. President, that truck driver fatigue may be a \ncontributing factor in as many as 30 to 40 percent of all heavy truck \naccidents.\n  FHWA has been looking at the issue of trucker fatigue since the \n1970's. I believe it is time we moved from studying the issue to making \ndecisions about what is to be done to reduce the number of accidents \nrelated to fatigue. I know that regulations alone will not stop these \ntragic accidents, we need increased education, we need increased \nawareness and better enforcement as well. But we can set an example and \nstart making changes in laws and regulations--some of them adopted 60 \nyears ago--to improve safety on our highways.\n  The Office of Motor Carrier Safety currently has six studies underway \non tired truckers. Three of them will be completed this year: Fitness \nfor Duty Testing, Multiple Trailer Combination Vehicle Driver Fatigue, \nand Stress and Rest Areas, and one, Driver Fatigue and Alertness Study \nwill be completed next spring. And I would like to thank the chairman \nagain for arranging a series of staff briefings on these studies, at my \nrequest. I believe it is important that this committee stay abreast of \nthe work being done in this area so that we may better formulate \nlegislative responses, where necessary.\n  In addition, the National Transportation Safety Board [NTSB] released \na study in January, 1995 on trucker fatigue that called on FHWA to \ncomplete rulemaking within 2 years on issues related to trucker \nfatigue, so the bill's language is in keeping with NTSB's \nrecommendation.\n  By establishing a time line for FHWA, we are requiring that the \ndecisionmaking process begin on this important issue. There is a lot \nmore to be done in this area, but the beginning of the rulemaking \nprocess is a big step in the right direction.\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Mr. President, I urge any Senators who have any final \namendments to come to the floor. I understand one Senator may offer an \namendment, at which time I hope we can pass this bill by unanimous \nconsent. I think we are prepared on this side of the aisle to pass this \nbill. But as I understand it, Senator Ashcroft may have an amendment.\n  Mr. President, I note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3067\n\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Missouri [Mr. Ashcroft] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 3067.\n\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 413, after line 14, insert the following new \n     subsection:\n       ``(d) The remedies provided in this part, concerning \n     matters covered by this part with respect to the \n     transportation of household goods by motor carriers are \n     exclusive and preempt the remedies provided under Federal or \n     State law.''\n\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I offer this amendment to provide for a \nfair and uniform way of compensating individuals, shippers of household \ngoods for damage to those goods and to ensure that there is a fair and \nuniform way of making sure that those damages can be received by \nshippers of household goods.\n  Interstate commerce involves the transmission of goods from one \njurisdiction to another. Something shipped in California may well cross \nnumerous States on its way to Connecticut. It is important that we do \nnot have the responsibility for those who ship goods to try and prove \nwhere damage happened to the goods if there are damages to the goods. \nIt is important that we do not have to try and impose on those who are \nthe carriers of the goods some ability to defend about whether or not \nthere was negligence.\n  There is in this amendment, and the meaning of this amendment, a \nrequirement that if goods are damaged, that no person whose goods have \nbeen damaged has to prove that the damages were caused by the \nnegligence of the carrier or, otherwise, by the improper activities of \nthe carrier. There is an automatic right of the person who ships the \ngoods to recover the value of the goods, and that would be uniform.\n  Absent that uniformity, there are other things which might exist. For \ninstance, normally, in order to recover against someone who has damaged \nsomething, you have to prove negligence. And I do not think that people \nwho ship goods are in a position to prove negligence. They were not in \npossession of the goods. They usually were not with the goods. They \nwere not in the area where the goods were damaged. They would have a \nhard time proving that.\n  So, this measure would provide that you do not have to prove \nnegligence, that if you deliver the goods to the shipper, the household \ngoods were being shipped across the country, and they were damaged, \nthat you could automatically recover the value of the goods without \nproving negligence, without having to show that there was a particular \nsubstandard way of dealing with the goods on the part of the carrier \ninvolved.\n  In return for the concession that the shipper of the goods, the \nperson who sends the goods, does not have to prove negligence, the \ndamages are limited to the value of the goods. You cannot recover \nemotional harm or pain and suffering because of the anguish of learning \nthat your Aunt Millie's vase was crushed in the shipment. You can only \nget the value of the vase.\n  So, the carrier is protected from having to pay some very subjective \ndamages, but the person who ships the goods is guaranteed that if the \ngoods are damaged, that those goods can be replaced because of the \nstrict liability on the part of the carrier. This is a good system. It \nis a system which has long worked. It ought to be enshrined in this \nstatute.\n  Now, the alternative is to have States create different laws about \nwhat kinds of recovery could be made by individuals whose goods were \ndamaged. You have the potential of someone who ships something from \nCalifornia to Connecticut trying to prove that their goods were damaged \nin the most generous State or that their goods otherwise were valuable \nso that if that State allowed for pain and suffering or emotional \ndistress, that those kinds of damages ought to be considered.\n  In my judgment, such damages ought not to be considered because they \nprovide an incentive for forum shopping, people trying to make sure and \nprove that goods were damaged in one State as opposed to another. They \nsubject shippers to unreasonable requirements to try and prove where \nthe damage happened or where it did not happen. And we would be well-\nserved in regulating interstate commerce to say that the person \nshipping the goods does not have to prove negligence, but the person \nwho is carrying the goods is not responsible for a level of damages \nwhich is above and beyond the value of the goods, which would include \nemotional distress or other kinds of subjective things which are very \ndifficult to prove and the amount of which could go into very high \nlevels of expenditure above and beyond the value of the goods.\n\n  It is with that in mind that I have proposed the amendment, and I \nbelieve the amendment would be something that should be included in \nthis measure.\n  Mr. FORD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, we have on this side not seen the amendment \nbefore it was proposed tonight. As I understand it, there may be some \non our side, particularly on the Commerce \n\n[[Page S 17601]]\nCommittee, that would object to the Senator's amendment. I am put in \nthe position of trying to secure some advice and counsel now from at \nleast the ranking member of the Commerce Committee. So, we will be \ndelayed for some time because he is in a conference, and we will have \nto try to reach him and see what we can do.\n  So, Mr. President, I have no alternative but to suggest the absence \nof a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                      Amendment 3063, As Modified\n\n              (Purpose: To modify the manager's amendment)\n\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk to \nmodify the manager's amendment. This amendment just changes one word, \nand it has been agreed to by both sides of the aisle.\n  I send the amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the pending amendment is \nset aside.\n  The amendment is so modified.\n  The amendment, as modified, is as follows:\n\n       On page 3 of the amendment, between lines 14 and 15, insert \n     the following: ``On page 311, line 16, insert `reasonable' \n     after `a'.''.\n\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/11/28/senate-section/article/S17593-1", "month": "11", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "28", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S17601]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         GOOD NEWS FOR ALASKANS\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I come to the floor today to say this is \na good day for my State of Alaska. This afternoon President Clinton \nsigned legislation which lifts the ban on the export of Alaskan North \nSlope crude oil and authorizes the sale of the Alaska Power \nAdministration.\n  Alaskans have been fighting for both of these provisions for more \nthan 20 years. The ban on the export of our own oil was unjust and \nunconstitutional, as I have said here on the floor many times. Before \ntoday, Alaska was the only State prohibited from exporting its most \nvaluable product. There is no ban on the sale of oil from Texas or the \nexporting of apples from Washington State. I see the distinguished \noccupant of the chair is from my southern neighboring State.\n  Today's action by the President lifts years of discrimination against \nAlaska, and I think it proves that perseverance can overcome bad \npolicy. Lifting this ban will promote domestic oil production, provide \njobs, and make Alaska less dependent on foreign oil. The ban has had \nthe unintended effect of actually threatening our energy security by \ndiscouraging further energy production in the south 48 and creating \nunfair hardships for a struggling oil industry in the United States.\n  Fundamentally, the existing export restriction distorts the crude oil \nmarkets in Alaska and on the west coast. The inability to export \nAlaskan North Slope crude oil depresses the open market price of Alaska \nNorth Slope crude on the west coast, which is essentially the only \nmarket for our oil. Some people will tell us that it makes no sense to \nlift the export ban while Congress is pursuing an effort to authorize \noil exploration on Alaska's arctic coastal plain. And nothing could be \nfurther from the truth.\n  Lifting the export ban simply restores a true market price for \nAlaskan oil, and the west coast will still be the principle consumer of \nthat product. What this new law does is allow an Alaskan product to be \nsold at a fair price, the same demand farmers in the Midwest make when \nthey sell their crops or automakers in Detroit make when they sell \ntheir products.\n  The Department of Energy noted in a 1994 study of the export ban that \nthe result of the export ban means ``that the west coast generates the \nlargest gross refiner margins in the world.''\n  So what does this new law do? It puts fairness back into the economic \nsystem and removes an ugly vestige of protectionism.\n  One of the main reasons I have come to the floor is to congratulate \nthe chairman of the Energy Committee, my colleague and good friend, \nSenator Frank Murkowski. I also congratulate Congressman Don Young, \nchairman of the House Resources Committee. My two colleagues made great \nefforts to shepherd this bill through the legislative process.\n  Actually, Mr. President, I think the President signed the bill \nprincipally to help California because most of the jobs to be restored \nwill be in California. And I do thank him and Energy Secretary O'Leary \nfor their support of this bill.\n  The Department of Energy did issue a comprehensive report last year \nthat proved once and for all that the ban on exporting Alaskan oil made \nno sense. Lifting that ban will create 25,000 jobs nationally, most of \nthem in California, as I said, and could return substantial funds to \nthe Nation and to the States of California and Alaska.\n  The sale of the Alaska Power Administration is another item, an item \nthat I have worked on for more than two decades. During the Nixon \nadministration, I introduced in the Senate the first bill to authorize \nthe sale of this entity.\n  Today's actions restore some of the promise that was made when we \nobtained statehood for Alaskans. We always sought to be a full partner \nwith other States. For too long, Alaska has been treated as a second-\nclass citizen, and I think the export ban was one example. The refusal \nto pass the law to sell the Alaska Power Administration, as was \nrequested by our citizens 20 years ago, is also an example of just \nholding up something that was good for Alaska because one Senator in \nthe Congress opposed it.\n  I do believe that in a State where the Federal Government controls \nmore than 70 percent of the land that we should have been able to \nexport our oil as a marketable product. There would have been a great \ndeal more demand for Alaska's oil exploration in the last period \nparticularly since the discovery of oil on the North Slope. I think it \nwas unfortunate that that was one of the provisions we had to agree to \nto obtain approval by Congress of the bill that gave us authority to \ngrant the right-of-way for the Trans-Alaska Pipeline.\n  In my judgment, this has been a long time coming. There is still a \nlong line of actions, Mr. President. The Alaskans have requested us to \ngive them full rights of statehood, and I intend to come to the Senate \nand ask for those rights as the time goes by.\n  Thank you very much, Mr. President. I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. PRESSLER.

Mr. President, I am opposed to sending troops to Bosnia \nbased on the information I now have. I base that judgment, in part, on \nmy own experience as a lieutenant in the Army in Vietnam many years \nago. It has been my observation that our soldiers have a very hard time \nin a civil-war situation in another country, and that is because our \nsoldiers are frequently used essentially as shields. We value human \nlife so highly that we react very strongly to any body bags coming back \nor to any casualties, as we should.\n  There is probably no other country in the world that reacts to its \nsoldiers being killed or captured as we do in the United States, and \nagain, Mr. President, we should act that way. Any action by our \nsoldiers will be shown on television in living color. If there are any \nfunerals, they will be a nationwide event. U.S. soldiers become shields \nand hostages and symbols very quickly.\n  If we had a vital interest that we could accomplish there, I would be \nfor \n\n[[Page S 17602]]\nit. Unfortunately, it is my strong feeling that the various civil wars \nin Yugoslavia since the 15th century have been augmented by virtue of \nhaving foreign troops come into what is now Yugoslavia and enter into \nthe civil war.\n  The current civil war there has been extended because foreign troops \nhave come. Let us analogously consider our Civil War in the United \nStates. There were not foreign troops involved, and it was settled. It \nwas a bloody, gruesome war, but it was settled. Let us just imagine \nforeign troops had come to our Civil War. We probably would still be \nfighting it today.\n  What is happening in Yugoslavia is that they are on the border \nbetween East and West, between the Moslem world and Christian world, \nbetween all the empires of the East and West. Every time they have a \ncivil war, foreign troops come and get involved, and we are part of \nthat pattern. We are doing the same thing.\n  I do not believe our troops are going to be able to solve the problem \nthere. I think they are going to be shields and hostages. I think, as \noccurred in Haiti, our best intentions will not result in our intended \nconsequences. We are receiving reports that in Haiti, all the money our \ntaxpayers spent, plus the presence of the U.S. troops, have been for \nnought, because now President Aristide is indicating he wants to stay \non, or at least that has been the indication. There is rioting in the \nstreets, and it does not seem we accomplished the objectives the \ntaxpayers were asked to pursue.\n  So I know our President is acting in the best faith, but based on my \npersonal experiences as a soldier in Vietnam, I believe this is a \nmistake. Some people have said to me, ``Are you willing to support the \nPresident?'' Of course, I want to support the President, but I have a \ngreat deal of difficulty because of my personal experiences. I served \ntwo tours of duty in Vietnam as a lieutenant and based on that \nexperience, I am opposed to our troops going into Bosnia.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

If \nthere be no further amendment to be proposed, the question is on \nagreeing to the committee amendment in the nature of a substitute, as \namended.\n  The committee amendment in the nature of a substitute, as amended, \nwas agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on the engrossment and third \nreading of the bill.\n  The bill was ordered to be engrossed for a third reading and was read \nthe third time.\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nCommerce Committee be discharged from further consideration of H.R. \n2539, the House companion, and that the Senate immediately proceed to \nits consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The bill will be stated by title.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (H.R. 2539) to abolish the Interstate Commerce \n     Commission, to amend subtitle IV of title 49, United States \n     Code, to reform economic regulation of transportation, and \n     for other purposes.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the immediate \nconsideration of the bill?\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Mr. President, I ask further that all after the \nenacting clause be stricken and the text of S. 1396, as amended, be \ninserted in lieu thereof and that H.R. 2539 be read a third time, and \nthe Senate then immediately vote on passage of H.R. 2539.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. EXON. We have no objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The question is on the engrossment of the amendment and third reading \nof the bill.\n  The amendment was ordered to be engrossed and the bill to be read a \nthird time.\n  The bill was read the third time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The bill having been read the third time, the \nquestion is, Shall it pass?\n  The bill (H.R. 2539), as amended, was passed, as follows:\n  (The text of the bill will be printed in a future edition of the \nRecord.)\n  Mr. EXON. I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. PRESSLER. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. PRESSLER. I finally ask unanimous consent that S. 1396 be placed \nback on the calendar.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Finally, Mr. President, I want to take just a moment to \nthank some of the staff and individuals who worked so hard to make this \nlegislation possible. They have been working for many months and \ndeserve our thanks. First, let me thank Chris McLean of Senator Exon's \nstaff and Clyde Hart and Carl Bentzel of the committee's minority \nstaff. On the committee's majority staff, I want to thank Tom \nHohenthaner and Mike King for their hard work in bringing us to this \npoint. Each of these staff members demonstrated the kind of bipartisan \ninitiative that epitomized the process and the professionalism that \nmade the legislation possible. Finally, I wish to give the highest \npraise to Ann Begeman for her diligent work on this bill. She displayed \ngreat persistence and leadership and I want to especially recognize her \nefforts.\n  Let me also thank Linda Morgan, chairman of the ICC, for all her \nguidance and expertise. Her efforts are much appreciated. I also want \nto thank a staff member of the ICC, Ellen Hansen, who was generously \ndetailed to the committee by the agency and who has worked very hard, \nand provided the technical expertise necessary to produce legislation \nthat provides a reasonable and orderly transition. I very much \nappreciate the professional work done by all these dedicated \nindividuals.\n  Mr. President, I note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  \n[[Page S 17603]]\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. PRESSLER.

Background\n\n                            A. Introduction\n\n       The Congressional Accountability Act of 1995 (``CAA''), PL \n     104-1, was enacted into law on January 23, 1995. In general, \n     the CAA applies the rights and protections of eleven federal \n     labor and employment law statutes to covered employees and \n     employing offices within the legislative branch. Section \n     203(a) of the CAA applies the rights and protections of \n     subsections (a)(1) and (d) of section 6, section 7, and \n     section 12(c) of the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 (29 \n     U.S.C. 206(a)(1) and (d), 207, 212(c) (``FLSA'') to covered \n     employees and employing offices. Section 203(c) of the CAA (2 \n     U.S.C. Section 1313(c)) directs the Board of Directors of the \n     Office of Compliance established under the CAA to issue \n     regulations to implement the section. Section 203(c)(2) (2 \n     U.S.C. Section 1313(c)(2)) further states that such \n     regulations, with the exception of certain irregular work \n     schedule regulations to be issued under section 203(a)(3), \n     ``shall be the same as substantive regulations issued by the \n     Secretary of Labor to implement the statutory provisions \n     referred to in subsection (a) except insofar as the Board may \n     determine, for good cause shown and stated together with the \n     regulation, that a modification of such regulations would be \n     more effective for the implementation of the rights and \n     protections under this section.''\n\n                B. Advance notice of proposed rulemaking\n\n       On September 28, 1995, the Board of the Office of \n     Compliance issued an Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking \n     (``ANPRM'') soliciting comments from interested parties in \n     order to obtain participation and information early in the \n     rulemaking process. 141 Cong. R. S14542 (daily ed., Sept. 28, \n     1995). In addition to inviting comment on specific questions \n     arising under five of the statutes made applicable by the CAA \n     in the ANPRM, the Board and the statutory appointees of the \n     Office sought consultation with the Chair of the \n     Administrative Conference of the United States, the Secretary \n     of Labor and the Director of the Office of Personnel \n     Management with regard to the development of these \n     regulations in accordance with section 304(g) of the CAA. The \n     Office has also consulted with interested parties to further \n     its understanding of the need for and content of appropriate \n     regulations. Based on the information gleaned from these \n     consultations and the comments on the ANPRM, the Board of \n     Directors of the Office of Compliance is publishing these \n     proposed rules, pursuant to Section 203(c)(1) of the CAA (2 \n     U.S.C. Section 1313(c)(1)).\n     1. Modification of the regulations of the Department of Labor\n       In the ANPRM, the Board asked the question, ``Whether and \n     to what extent should the Board modify the Secretary's \n     Regulations?'' The Board received 15 comments on the ANPRM: \n     two from Senators, four from House Members (one from the \n     leadership of the Committee with primary jurisdiction for the \n     CAA and one from three of the sponsors of the CAA), one from \n     the Secretary of the Senate and three from House offices (two \n     from institutional offices and one from a Member's Chief of \n     Staff), four from business coalitions or associations \n     representing an array of private employers, and one from a \n     labor organization.\n       Those commenters who expressed views on the ANPRM cited \n     both the statute and the legislative history in taking the \n     position that the CAA presumes that the regulations of the \n     Department of Labor should not be modified. Illustrative \n     comments included the following:\n       ``[Section 304 of the CAA] evidences clear legislative \n     intent that the Board apply these rights and protections to \n     Congressional employees in a manner comparable to and \n     consistent with the rights and protections applicable to \n     employees in the private sector under regulations adopted by \n     the Secretary (DOL).  . . . The [CAA] requires that the \n     regulations issued by the Board be the same as those issued \n     by DOL unless the Board determines that modification would \n     more effectively implement the rights and protections of the \n     laws made applicable under the [CAA].''\n       ``[I]f a law is right for the private sector, it is right \n     for Congress; . . . Consistent with [this] principle, we \n     would urge the Office not to deviate (except in those few \n     areas where expressly authorized by the CAA) from applying \n     the laws in the same manner in which they are applied to the \n     private sector.\n\n                           *   *   *   *   *\n\n       [W]e have not identified any situations in which \n     modifications [of the DOL regulations] would be \n     appropriate.''\n       ``There are no circumstances that justify `good cause' for \n     adopting regulations that deviate from those currently \n     applied to private sector employers.''\n       ``[Section 203(c)(2)] confers on the Office of Compliance \n     only very limited authority to deviate from the present DOL \n     regulations. The legislative history to the `good cause' \n     exception likewise makes clear that this authority is to be \n     use by the Office of Compliance sparingly.''\n\n                           *   *   *   *   *\n\n       ``The legislative history of the CAA demands that the \n     Office of Compliance apply to Congress the same regulations \n     as those imposed on the private sector.''\n       ``[W]e urge the Board to refrain from modifying regulations \n     promulgated by the Department of Labor and other Executive \n     agencies. Use of established regulations will provide the \n     Board, employees and employing offices with a body of \n     instructive case law and interpretive documents.''\n       ``While the Office serves an important implementation and \n     enforcement role, it must not place itself in the position of \n     shielding Congress from substantive requirements imposed on \n     private businesses.''\n       Based on the comments and the Board's understanding of the \n     law and the institutions to which it is being made \n     applicable, the Board is issuing the Secretary's regulations \n     with only these limited modifications: Technical changes in \n     the nomenclature and deletion of those sections clearly \n     inapplicable to the legislative branch.\n     2. Notice posting and recordkeeping\n       The ANPRM also invited comment on whether the recordkeeping \n     and notice posting requirements of the various laws made \n     applicable by the CAA are incorporated as statutory \n     requirements of the CAA. The ANPRM inquired whether, if such \n     requirements were not incorporated, could and should the \n     Board develop its own requirements pursuant to its ``good \n     cause'' authority. The ANPRM also invited comment on \n     proposing guidelines and models for recordkeeping and notice \n     posting.\n       Commenters were in agreement that recordkeeping and notice \n     posting are important to the effective implementation of \n     several of the statutes incorporated in the CAA. However, \n     opinions as to whether the Board should require notice \n     posting and recordkeeping were widely divergent. Several \n     commenters expressed the view that the Board lacks the \n     statutory authority to adopt notice posting and recordkeeping \n     requirements \n\n[[Page S 17604]]\n     and that the notice posting and recordkeeping requirements of the FLSA \n     do not apply to Congress. Other commenters expressed the view \n     that the Board has the authority to issue regulations to \n     impose recordkeeping and notice posting requirements and that \n     such regulations should be, in substance, the same as those \n     with which the private sector must comply.\n       The Board agrees with those commenters who took the \n     position that, if employing offices are to be treated the \n     same as private sector employers are treated under FLSA, they \n     should have to comply with the statute's notice posting and \n     recordkeeping requirements. Moreover, the Board notes that \n     notice posting and recordkeeping promote the full and \n     effective enforcement of these incorporated rights and \n     protections. In the Board's view, notice posting and \n     recordkeeping may well be in employers' interests both as a \n     sound personnel practice and in order to defend against \n     subsequent litigation.\n       But while the CAA incorporates certain specific sections of \n     the FLSA, the CAA explicitly did not incorporate the notice \n     posting and recordkeeping requirements of Section 11, 29 \n     U.S.C. Sec. 211 of the FLSA. Because the Board's authority to \n     modify the Secretary's regulations for ``good cause'' does \n     not authorize it to adopt regulatory requirements that are \n     the equivalent of statutory requirements that Congress has \n     omitted from the CAA, the Board has determined that it may \n     not impose such requirements on employing offices. However, \n     as various commenters suggest, the Board will provide \n     guidance to employing offices concerning model recordkeeping \n     practices as part of carrying out its program of education \n     under section 301(h) of the CAA (2 U.S.C. 1381(h)).\n       The Board would also note that based upon their collective \n     years of experience representing employers and employees with \n     regard to various labor and employment laws, including the \n     FLSA, the absence of recordkeeping and notice posting \n     requirements may create a void which can only partially be \n     filled by the program of education to be carried out by the \n     Board pursuant to Section 301(h)(1) and the optional notice \n     which will be distributed by the Board pursuant to Section \n     301(h)(2). The Board also would emphasize that employees will \n     in many circumstances be able to establish a prima facie case \n     simply by their own testimony estimating the hours worked by \n     the employees where the employing office has failed to \n     maintain adequate, accurate records. An employing office may \n     find that its ability to respond to an employee's prima facie \n     case is substantially burdened by its failure to keep \n     accurate payroll and time-records. If Congress wishes to \n     experience the same burdens as faced by the private sector \n     and also to address these issues, it should enact \n     recordkeeping requirements comparable to those of the FLSA. \n     (Of course, like the regulations under those statutes, such \n     recordkeeping requirements may leave to the discretion of \n     each employing office the precise form and manner in which \n     records will be kept.) But, in light of the text and \n     structure of the CAA, the Board believes that it is up to \n     Congress to decide whether to do so.\n\n                      II. The proposed regulations\n\n                             A. Background\n\n       Congress committed enforcement of the Fair Labor Standards \n     Act of 1938 to the Department of Labor and its Wage and Hour \n     Division, whose regulations and interpretations of that Act \n     comprise almost one thousand pages of Chapter V, Title 29 of \n     the Code of Federal Regulations. In enacting the CAA, \n     however, Congress expressly refused to commit enforcement to \n     the executive branch of the Federal government nor did \n     Congress bring its employing offices under the FLSA itself. \n     Instead, Congress carefully specified, through sectional \n     references to the FLSA, the substantive rights and \n     protections afforded to legislative employees, and precisely \n     mandated procedures by which those rights and protections \n     would be largely enforced by a new and independent office in \n     the legislative branch, the Office of Compliance. Further, in \n     granting the Board rulemaking authority with respect to the \n     FLSA in Section 203(c)(1) of the CAA, Congress affirmatively \n     commanded the Board to issue substantive regulations, with \n     the important directive that they ``shall be the same as \n     substantive regulations promulgated by the Secretary of Labor \n     * * * except as the Board may determine, for good cause shown \n     * * * that a modification of such regulations would be more \n     effective for the implementation of rights and protections \n     under'' the CAA.\n       In the Board's view, and notwithstanding what has been \n     urged by some of the commenters, this unusual statutory \n     framework neither mandates nor allows an uncritical, \n     wholesale incorporation of all the regulations and \n     interpretive statements issued by the Labor Department under \n     the FLSA. Rather, this statutory framework requires the Board \n     to cull from the vast body of FLSA material found in the Code \n     of Regulations only those items that constitute ``substantive \n     regulations'' as the term is understood under settled \n     principles of administrative law. (See Batterton v. Francis, \n     422 U.S. 416, 425, n. 9 (1977)). Moreover, the statutory \n     framework authorizes the Board to delete those substantive \n     regulations that either have no application in the employing \n     offices of the Congress or that are not likely to be invoked. \n     For these reasons, the Board is not proposing their adoption, \n     unless public comments establish a justification to the \n     contrary. Finally, by limiting itself to substantive \n     regulations, the Board is not adopting those portions of 29 \n     C.F.R. chapter V that constitute the interpretative bulletins \n     or statements of the Department of Labor and its Wage and \n     Hour Division.\n\n                        B. Proposed regulations\n\n     1. General provisions\n       The proposed regulations include an initial Part 501 which \n     contains matters of general applicability including the \n     purpose and scope of the regulations, definitions, coverage, \n     and the administrative authority of the Board and the Office \n     of Compliance. In addition, a section explains the effect of \n     interpretative bulletins and statements of the Department of \n     Labor, and another section provides for the application of \n     the Portal to Portal Act. These latter sections are discussed \n     below.\n       It is noted that the definition section incorporates the \n     general provisions of section 101 of the CAA which defines \n     ``employee,'' ``covered employee,'' ``employing office,'' and \n     ``employee of the House of Representatives.'' Section 203 of \n     the CAA, which applies the rights and protections of the \n     FLSA, also contemplates the promulgation of a definitional \n     regulation that excludes ``interns'' from the meaning of \n     ``covered employee.'' The Board in a separate NPRM issued on \n     October 11, 1995, proposed such a regulation, together with a \n     regulation governing irregular work schedules and the receipt \n     of compensatory time in lieu of overtime compensation. The \n     Board is reviewing the public comments received in response \n     to that NPRM and will issue a separate final rule on those \n     issues.\n       It should be noted that section 225(f)(1) of the CAA \n     provides that, except where inconsistent with definitions of \n     the CAA itself, the definitions in the laws made applicable \n     by the CAA shall also apply under the CAA. Thus, attention \n     must be paid to those definitions found in the FLSA that are \n     consistent with the CAA even if they are not expressly \n     incorporated in the proposed regulations. In this regard, one \n     commenter expressed concern over whether employing offices \n     would be obligated to pay minimum wages and overtime \n     compensation to individuals who do volunteer work, in light \n     of the fact that under the FLSA ``employee'' may include \n     certain volunteers. See 29 U.S.C. Sec. 203(e)(4)(A), which \n     excludes from the definition of ``employee'' only certain \n     volunteers who perform work for a State, political \n     subdivision, or interstate governmental agency. Similarly, it \n     is noted that, in enacting the CAA, Congress did make \n     separate provision for excluding interns. Thus, the Board has \n     concluded that, to the extent that volunteer activity would \n     bring an individual under the coverage of the FLSA, similarly \n     situated individuals would be treated in the same manner \n     under the CAA.\n     2. Provisions derived from regulations of the Department of \n         Labor\n       Those regulations of the Department of Labor that are being \n     adopted in substance include:\n       Part 531, which governs the manner in which an employee's \n     wages are calculated taking into account the reasonable cost \n     to an employer of furnishing board, lodging, or other \n     facilities. This Part is derived from Section 3(m) of the \n     FLSA, which directs how the ``wage'' paid to an employee is \n     determined. Section 3(m) must be treated as applicable under \n     the CAA by virtue of Section 225(f)(1), which authorizes \n     generally the inclusion of those definitions and exemptions \n     that are consistent with definitions and exemptions of the \n     CAA. However, it is noted that section 3(m) is inconsistent \n     with the CAA insofar as the implementing regulations in Part \n     531, Title 29, C.F.R., provide procedures by which the Wage \n     and Hour Administrator makes determinations in specific cases \n     with respect to the furnishing of board, lodging, or other \n     facilities. Because the Administrator has no role in the \n     enforcement of the CAA by reason of Section 225(f)(3), and \n     because the Board is not at this time is not authorizing the \n     Office of Compliance to make such specific determinations, \n     the Board proposes to delete the provisions setting forth \n     those procedures. Similarly, the reference to ``tipped \n     employees'' and the method by which their wages are \n     determined are deleted because the applicable sections assign \n     responsibility to the Administrator.\n       Part 541, which defines and delimits the bona fide \n     executive, administrative, and professional employees who are \n     exempt under Section 13(a) of the FLSA from the minimum \n     wage and maximum hours requirements. The Board has \n     determined that this exemption, commonly known as the \n     ``white collar'' exemption, is applicable to employing \n     offices of Congress by virtue of Section 225(f)(1) of the \n     CAA.\n       In the ANPRM, the Board solicited public comment on whether \n     and to what extent it should modify the Labor Department's \n     regulations regarding this exemption. Generally, the \n     commenters did not question the applicability of this \n     exemption to covered employees under the CAA, and several \n     commenters urged the adoption of all of the Department's \n     regulations in Part 541, 29 C.F.R., including the \n     interpretative bulletins, without any modification. Two \n     commenters contended that the Board's regulations should \n     grant a sweeping exemption for nearly all staff employees \n     working in elected members' offices because they exercise \n     independent judgment and discretion in performing their \n     responsibilities.\n\n[[Page S 17605]]\n\n       Other commenters urged the Board to modify the Labor \n     Department regulations to take into account the unique job \n     responsibilities of staff working for an elected member \n     either in a personal office, in a leadership office or on \n     committee. Recognizing that job titles alone cannot be \n     dispositive of who is an exempt employee, these commenters \n     urged the Board to identify with particularity those job \n     duties which, if performed by an employee, would render him \n     or her an exempt executive, administrative, or professional \n     employee.\n       The Board is proposing to adopt the Labor Department's \n     substantive regulations contained in Subpart A of Part 541 of \n     29 C.F.R. that set forth the fundamental criteria for \n     satisfying each of the three exemptions. But, for the reasons \n     explained below, the Board is not formally adopting the \n     interpretative bulletins contained in Subpart B of Part 541 \n     of 29 C.F.R., which discuss and illustrate through examples \n     the Department's understanding of the exemption criteria.\n       With respect to some commenters' request that the Board \n     modify the white collar exemptions, upon reflection, the \n     Board has reluctantly concluded that such a modification \n     would not satisfy the ``good cause'' requirement of Section \n     203(c)(2) of the CAA. The Board recognizes that the \n     Secretary's regulations and interpretations were promulgated \n     in a different era, with different employment paradigms in \n     mind. Thus, the Board appreciates the many difficulties that \n     employing offices will have in interpreting and reconciling \n     these regulations to present day realities. Moreover, the \n     Board is mindful of the significant impact the application of \n     the administrative, executive and professional exemption will \n     have on the structuring, functioning and expense of the \n     Members' and Senators' personal offices and committee \n     offices. However, the Board notes that private sector and \n     state and local government employers face the same \n     difficulties. And the Board has not found any sound, \n     principled basis for modifying the exemption regulation for \n     Congress and its instrumentalities. That resolved, the Board \n     nonetheless wishes to make clear its intent to provide, as \n     time and resources permit, appropriate general guidance to \n     the Congress and its instrumentalities on how to identify and \n     justify which employees are exempt. Such efforts made through \n     the Office's education and information programs, will attempt \n     to assist employing offices in determining which job duties \n     will be considered exempt under the executive, administration \n     or professional criteria.\n       Part 547, which defines, pursuant to Section 7(e)(3)(b) the \n     standard that bona fide thrift or savings plans must meet in \n     order not to be included within an employee's regular rate of \n     pay for purposes of calculating overtime obligations under \n     Section 7 of the FLSA. This is included in light of Section \n     203(a)1) of the CAA, which specifically applied the rights \n     and protections of Section 7 of the FLSA.\n       Part 570, which sets forth the limitations on the use of \n     child labor. This Part implements Section 12(c) of the FLSA, \n     prohibiting oppressive child labor, as defined by Section \n     3(l) of the same Act. The former section is specifically \n     referenced in Section 203(a)(1) of the CAA, while the latter \n     must be referenced by reason of Section 225(f)(1) of the CAA. \n     The inclusion of this Part in the separate regulations of the \n     Senate is necessitated by the fact that the Senate allows for \n     the appointment of congressional pages below the age of 16, \n     unlike the House of Representatives, which by law sets a \n     minimum age of 16 for such employees. For children under age \n     16, the FLSA regulations impose limitations on hours worked \n     during the school year. Part 570 is also included in the \n     separate regulations applicable to all other covered \n     employees and employing offices. Given the hazardous nature \n     of some of the activities of the support functions, such as \n     maintenance and repair, Part 570 regulations are being \n     proposed in the event that such instrumentalities employ \n     children under 18 years of age. It is noted that the Board \n     has not adopted regulations comparable to those set forth in \n     the Labor Department's Subpart B (29 C.F.R. Sections 570.5-\n     .27), authorizing the issuance of certificates of age. In \n     addition, with respect to Section 570.52, governing the \n     hazardous occupation of motor-vehicle driver and outside \n     helper, the Board is not adopting the special exemption for \n     school bus driving because by its terms no employing offices \n     would satisfy the criteria of the regulation.\n\n  C. Secretary of Labor's regulations that the Board proposes not to \n                                 adopt\n\n       In reviewing the remaining parts of the Labor Department's \n     regulations, it is readily apparent that some have no \n     application to the employing offices within the legislative \n     branch. For this reason, the Board is not including them \n     within its substantive regulations. Among the excluded \n     regulations are: Part 510, which pertains to the application \n     of the minimum wage provisions to Puerto Rico; Part 511, \n     establishing a wage order procedure for American Samoa; Part \n     515, authorizing the utilization of State government agencies \n     for investigations and inspections; Part 530, governing the \n     employment of industrial homeworkers in certain industries; \n     Part 549, defining the requirements of a ``bona fide profit-\n     sharing plan or trust;'' Part 550, defining the term ``talent \n     fees;'' Part 552, regulating the application of the FLSA to \n     domestic service; Part 575, addressing child labor in certain \n     agricultural employment; Parts 578, 579, and 580, \n     implementing the civil money penalties provisions of the \n     FLSA; and Part 679, dealing with industries in American \n     Samoa. Unless public comments suggest otherwise, the Board \n     intends including in the adopted regulations a provision \n     stating that the Board has issued regulations on all matters \n     for which the CAA requires a regulation. See Section 411 of \n     the CAA.\n       Other substantive regulations could have application in the \n     event that an employing office wished to avail itself of \n     certain special wage rates, subminimum wage exemptions or \n     overtime exemptions under the FLSA. These are found in: Parts \n     519-528, which authorize subminimum wages for full-time \n     students, student-learners, apprentices, learners, \n     messengers, workers with disabilities, and student workers; \n     Part 548, which authorizes in the collective bargaining \n     context the establishment of basic wage rates for overtime \n     compensation purposes; and Part 551, which implements an \n     overtime exemption for local delivery drivers and helpers. \n     Unless public comments provide a sufficient justification to \n     the contrary the Board is not proposing the adoption of \n     regulations covering the foregoing subjects.\n\n      III. The Interpretive Bulletins and Other Relevant Guidance\n\n       In addition to the substantive regulations found in \n     Subchapter A, the Department of Labor has issued, under \n     Subchapter B, ``Statements of General Policy or \n     Interpretations Not Directly Related to Regulations.'' 29 \n     C.F.R Parts 775-794. Usually called Interpretive Bulletins, \n     these statements make available in one place the official \n     interpretations which guide the Secretary of Labor and the \n     Wage and Hour Administrator in the performance of their \n     duties. As the interpretations of an administering agency, \n     such statements are usually given some deference by the \n     courts. As the Supreme Court has observed: ``the rulings, \n     interpretations and opinions of the Administrator under this \n     Act, while not controlling upon the courts by reason of their \n     authority, do constitute a body of experience and informed \n     judgment to which courts and litigants may properly resort \n     for guidance. The weight of such a judgment in a particular \n     case will depend upon the thoroughness evident in the \n     consideration, the validity of its reasoning its consistency \n     with earlier and later pronouncements, and all those factors \n     which give it power to persuade, if lacking power to \n     control.'' Skidmore v. Swift, 323 U.S. 134, 140 (1944).\n       However, unlike ``substantive regulations,'' these \n     interpretations are not issued by the agency pursuant to its \n     statutory authority to implement the statute and, more \n     significantly, do not have the force and effect of law. See \n     Batterton v. Francis, 432 U.S. 416, 425 n.9 (1977). The \n     Board's mandate is only to issue substantive regulations that \n     are ``the same as the substantive regulations of the \n     Secretary of Labor to implement the statutory provision [of \n     the FLSA] applied'' by Section 204(a) of the CAA unless \n     modified for good cause (CAA Section 203 (c)(2)). Therefore, \n     the Board, does not propose to adopt the non-substantive \n     interpretations of the DOL and its Wage and Hour Division as \n     substantive regulations under the CAA. Moreover, the Board is \n     not proposing to issue the Department's interpretations as \n     its own interpretations of the FLSA rights and protections \n     made applicable under the CAA at this time. However, as \n     discussed below, employing offices should be advised that, \n     pursuant to the Portal to Portal Act, the Board will give due \n     consideration to the Secretary's interpretations of the FLSA.\n       Application of the Portal to Portal Act.--The Portal to \n     Portal Act, 61 Stat. 84 (1947), codified generally at 29 \n     U.S.C. Sections 216 and 251, et seq. (``PPA''), contains \n     provisions which affect the rights and liabilities of \n     employees and employers with regard to alleged underpayment \n     of minimum or overtime wages under the FLSA. Section 4 of the \n     PPA excludes from the definition of hours worked both \n     activities preliminary to or postliminary to the worker's \n     principal activities and travel time absent a contract, \n     custom or practice to the contrary. 29 U.S.C. Section 254. \n     Sections 9 and 10 of the PPA provide the employer with a \n     defense against liability or punishment in any action or \n     proceeding brought against it for failure to comply with the \n     minimum wage and overtime provisions of the FLSA, where the \n     employer pleads and proves that the act or omission \n     complained of was in good faith in conformity with and in \n     reliance on any regulation, order, ruling, approval, \n     interpretation, administrative practice or enforcement \n     policy of the Wage and Hour Administrator of the \n     Department of Labor. 29 U.S.C. Sections 258-259. The PPA \n     also contains provisions which restrict and limit employee \n     suits under section 16(b) of the FLSA. For example, \n     section 11 of the PPA provides that in any action brought \n     under section 216 of the FLSA, the court may in its \n     discretion, subject to prescribed conditions, award no \n     liquidated damages or award any amount of such damages not \n     to exceed the amount specified in section 16(b) of the \n     FLSA. 29 U.S.C. Section 260.\n       The Board has determined that the above provisions of the \n     PPA are incorporated into section 203 of the CAA, either as \n     an amendment to section 16(b) of the FLSA (which is expressly \n     applied to the legislative branch under section 203(b) of the \n     CAA), or by virtue of section 225(f) of the CAA, which \n     applies the definitions and exemptions of the FLSA to the \n     extent not inconsistent with the CAA. To that end, the Board \n     will give due consideration to the interpretations of the \n     FLSA of \n\n[[Page S 17606]]\n     the Secretary of Labor. Moreover, employing offices may utilize these \n     interpretations in attempting to understand the rights and \n     protections under the FLSA that have been made applicable by \n     the CAA. Unless and until the Secretary's interpretive \n     statements are superseded or interpretative guidance or \n     decisions to the contrary are issued by the Board or the \n     courts, they may be relied upon for purposes of defending \n     against claims brought under the CAA to the same extent as \n     private sector employers may properly rely upon them in \n     actions brought under the FLSA.\n       Joint Employer Doctrine.--The Board solicited comments in \n     the ANPRM on whether and to what extent the joint employment \n     doctrine as developed under the FLSA is applicable under the \n     CAA. The comments generally advocated adoption of the \n     doctrine to employing offices of the Congress. However, since \n     the issue of joint employment is addressed through a DOL \n     interpretive bulletin set forth in Part 791, 29 C.F.R., \n     rather than a substantive regulation, the Board is not \n     adopting it as such nor issuing it as its own interpretive \n     statement. See discussion at Section III.\n       Equal Pay Act.--With respect to the Equal Pay Act (EPA), \n     which is included in Section 6(d) of the FLSA, 29 U.S.C. \n     Section 206(d), the Secretary of Labor promulgated \n     interpretative regulations that were originally included in \n     29 C.F.R. Part 800. Pursuant to the provisions of \n     Reorganization Plan No. 1 of 1978, as confirmed by the \n     Congress in Public Law 98-532, 98 Stat. 2705 (1984), \n     enforcement and administration of the EPA was transferred \n     from the Secretary of Labor to the Equal Employment \n     Opportunity Commission (EEOC). The EEOC promulgated its own \n     interpretations implementing the EPA at 29 C.F.R. Part 1620. \n     Thereafter, the Secretary deleted its interpretations. 52 FR \n     2517 (Jan. 23, 1987). Thus, there are no substantive \n     regulations implementing the EPA. Under the rationale \n     previously stated regarding the Portal to Portal Act, the \n     Board declines to incorporate the EEOC interpretations as \n     substantive regulations under the CAA but will recognize them \n     as is appropriate.\n       Opinion letters.--Commenters asked that the Board consider \n     establishing a process under which the Office or the Board \n     would issue opinion letters and upon which employing offices \n     could rely, similar to the procedure followed by the Wage and \n     Hour Administrator in sometimes providing such opinions at \n     the request of private sector employers. The Board \n     understands employing offices' desire for guidance and \n     clarity regarding their obligations under the CAA.\n       To the extent that the Board itself can address issues \n     through regulations or interpretations, it will do so. \n     Moreover, the Office intends to provide appropriate education \n     and technical assistance as part of its education and \n     information responsibilities. But for the reasons stated \n     here, the Board and the Office's ability to do so is limited \n     by legal, resource and policy considerations. As is the case \n     in the private sector context, many issues under these \n     statutes can only be definitively resolved through case-by-\n     case adjudication on particular facts. Moreover, except in \n     the context of statutes subject to the Portal to Portal Act, \n     it is doubtful that the Board or the Office has the statutory \n     authority to issue guidance with legal effect (outside of the \n     adjudicatory or rulemaking contexts); we are not aware of any \n     such legal authorization for Executive Branch agencies to do \n     so in the context of applying these same laws to the private \n     sector. Further, the resources of the Board and the Office \n     are limited: the first year appropriation is for $2.5 \n     million. These resources are substantially less than those \n     available to analogous Executive Branch agencies that \n     administer fewer laws. Finally, public comment has not \n     provided the Board with the facts necessary for yet making \n     any of these determinations--and a detailed evidentiary \n     record is necessary for such judgment to be made. In short, \n     particularly in light of the various statutory \n     responsibilities of the Office and the Board, it is not \n     possible to give answers with legal effect to each individual \n     request for information and guidance. While the Board will \n     structure education and information programs to assist \n     employees and employing offices, it is forced to respond \n     that, like private employers, employing offices will \n     generally have to rely on their own counsel and human \n     resource advisors in determining their compliance with the \n     Congressional Accountability Act.\n\n                         IV. Method of Approval\n\n       The Board recommends that (1) the version of the proposed \n     regulations that shall apply to the Senate and employees of \n     the Senate be approved by the Senate by resolution; (2) the \n     version of the proposed regulations that shall apply to the \n     House of Representatives and employees of the House of \n     Representatives be approved by the House of Representatives \n     by resolution; and (3) the version of the proposed \n     regulations that shall apply to other covered employees and \n     employing offices be approved by the Congress by concurrent \n     resolution.\n       Signed at Washington, D.C., on this 21st day of November, \n     1995.\n\n                                                Glen D.

S501.00 Corresponding section table of the FLSA \n       regulations of the Labor Department and the CAA regulations \n       of the Office of Compliance.\n\n       The following table lists the parts of the Secretary of \n     Labor Regulations at Title 29 of the Code of Federal \n     Regulations under the FLSA with the corresponding parts of \n     the Office of Compliance (CO) Regulations under Section 203 \n     of the CAA:\n       Secretary of Labor Regulations--OC Regulations.\n       Part 531: Wage payments under the Fair Labor Standards Act \n     of 1938--Part S531.\n       Part 541: Defining and delimiting the terms ``bona fide \n     executive,'' ``administrative,'' and ``professional'' \n     employees--Part S541.\n       Part 547: Requirements of a ``Bona fide thrift or savings \n     plan''--Part S547.\n       Part 570: Child labor--Part S570.\n\n\n              subpart a--matters of general applicability\n\n     Sec. S501.101 Purpose and scope.\n\n       (a) Section 203 of the Congressional Accountability Act \n     (CAA) provides that the rights and protections of subsections \n     (a)(1) and (d) of section 6, section 7, and section 12(c) of \n     the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 (FLSA) (29 U.S.C. \n     Sec. Sec. 206(a)(1) and (d), 207, 212(c)) shall apply to \n     covered employees of the legislative branch of the Federal \n     government. Section 301 of the CAA creates the Office of \n     Compliance as an independent office in the legislative branch \n     for enforcing the rights and protections of the FLSA, as \n     applied by the CAA.\n       (b) The FLSA as applied by the CAA provides for minimum \n     standards for both wages and overtime entitlements, and \n     delineates administrative procedures by which covered \n     worktime must be compensated. Included also in the FLSA are \n     provisions related to child labor, equal pay, and portal-to-\n     portal activities. In addition, the FLSA exempts specified \n     employees or groups of employees from the application of \n     certain of its provisions.\n       (c) This chapter contains the substantive regulations with \n     respect to the FLSA that the Board of Directors of the Office \n     of Compliance has adopted pursuant to Sections 203(c) and 304 \n     of the CAA, which require that the Board promulgate \n     regulations that are ``the same as substantive regulations \n     promulgated by the Secretary of Labor to implement the \n     statutory provisions referred to in subsection (a) [of \n     Sec. 203 of the CAA] except insofar as the Board may \n     determine, for good cause shown . . . that a modification of \n     such regulations would be more effective for the \n     implementation of the rights and protections under this \n     section.''\n\n     Sec. S501.102 Definitions.\n\n       For purposes of this chapter:\n       (a) CAA means the Congressional Accountability Act of 1995 \n     (P.L. 104-1, 109 Stat. 3, 2 U.S.C. Sec. Sec. 1301-1438).\n       (b) FLSA or Act means the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938, \n     as amended (29 U.S.C. Sec. 201 et seq.).\n       (c) Covered employee means any employee of the Senate, \n     including an applicant for employment and a former employee.\n       (d) Employee of the Senate includes any employee whose pay \n     is disbursed by the Secretary of the Senate, but not any such \n     individual employed by (1) the Capitol Guide Service; (2) the \n     Capitol Police; (3) the Congressional Budget Office; (4) the \n     Office of the Architect of the Capitol; (5) the Office of the \n     Attending Physician; (6) the Office of Compliance; or (7) the \n     Office of Technology Assessment.\n       (e) Employing office and employer mean (1) the personal \n     office of a Senator; (2) a committee of the Senate or a joint \n     committee; or (3) any other office headed by a person with \n     the final authority to appoint, hire, discharge, and set the \n     terms, conditions, or privileges of the employment of an \n     employee of the Senate.\n       (f) Board means the Board of Directors of the Office of \n     Compliance.\n       (g) Office means the Office of Compliance.\n\n     Sec. S501.103 Coverage.\n\n       The coverage of Section 203 of the CAA extends to any \n     covered employee of an employing office without regard to \n     whether the covered employee is engaged in commerce or the \n     production of goods for interstate commerce and without \n     regard to size, number of employees, amount of business \n     transacted, or other measure.\n\n     Sec. S501.104 Administrative authority.\n\n       (a) The Office of Compliance is authorized to administer \n     the provisions of Section 203 of the Act with respect to any \n     covered employee or covered employer.\n       (b) The Board is authorized to promulgate substantive \n     regulations in accordance with the provisions of Sections \n     203(c) and 304 of the CAA.\n\n[[Page S 17607]]\n\n       (c) The Board may in its discretion from time to time issue \n     interpretative statements providing guidance to employees and \n     to employing offices on the rights and protections \n     established under the FLSA that are made applicable by \n     Sections 203(a) and 225 of the CAA.\n\n     Sec. S501.105 Effect of Interpretations of the Department of \n       Labor.\n\n       (a) In administering the FLSA, the Wage and Hour Division \n     of the Department of Labor has issued not only substantive \n     regulations but also interpretative bulletins. Substantive \n     regulations represent an exercise of statutorily-delegated \n     lawmaking authority from the legislative branch to an \n     administrative agency. Generally, they are proposed in \n     accordance with the notice-and-comment procedures of the \n     Administrative Procedure Act (APA), 5 U.S.C. Sec. 553. Once \n     promulgated, such regulations are considered to have the \n     force and effect of law, unless set aside upon judicial \n     review as arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or \n     otherwise not in accordance with law. See Batterton v. \n     Francis, 432 U.S. 416, 425 n.9 (1977). See also 29 C.F.R. \n     Sec. 790.17(b) (1994). Unlike substantive regulations, \n     interpretative statements, including bulletins and other \n     releases of the Wage and Hour Division, are not issued \n     pursuant to the provisions of the APA and may not have the \n     force and effect of law. Rather, they may only constitute \n     official interpretations of the Department of Labor with \n     respect to the meaning and application of the minimum wage, \n     maximum hour, and overtime pay requirements of the FLSA. See \n     29 C.F.R. Sec. 790.17(c) (citing Final Report of the Attorney \n     General's Committee on Administrative Procedure, Senate \n     Document No.8, 77th Cong., 1st Sess., at p. 27 (1941)). The \n     purpose of such statements is to make available in one place \n     the interpretations of the FLSA which will guide the \n     Secretary of Labor and the Wage and Hour Administrator in the \n     performance of their duties unless and until they are \n     otherwise directed by authoritative decisions of the courts \n     or conclude, upon reexamination of an interpretation, that it \n     is incorrect. The Supreme Court has observed: ``[T]he \n     rulings, interpretations and opinions of the Administrator \n     under this Act, while not controlling upon the courts by \n     reason of their authority, do constitute a body of experience \n     and informed judgment to which courts and litigants may \n     properly resort for guidance. The weight of such a judgment \n     in a particular case will depend upon the thoroughness \n     evident in the consideration, the validity of its reasoning, \n     its consistency with earlier and later pronouncements, and \n     all those factors which give it power to persuade, if lacking \n     power to control.'' Skidmore v. Swift, 323 U.S. 134, 140 \n     (1944).\n       (b) Section 203(c) of the CAA provides that the substantive \n     regulations implementing Section 203 of the CAA shall be \n     ``the same as substantive regulations promulgated by the \n     Secretary of Labor'' except where the Board finds, for good \n     cause shown, that a modification would more effectively \n     implement the rights and protections established by the FLSA. \n     Thus, the CAA by its terms does not mandate that the Board \n     adopt the interpretative statements of the Department of \n     Labor or its Wage and Hour Division. The Board is thus not \n     adopting such statements as part of its substantive \n     regulations.\n\n     Sec. S501.106 Application of the Portal-to-Portal Act of \n       1947.\n\n       (a) Consistent with Section 225 of the CAA, the Portal to \n     Portal Act (PPA), 29 U.S.C. Sec. Sec. 216 and 251 et seq., is \n     applicable in defining and delimiting the rights and \n     protections of the FLSA that are prescribed by the CAA. \n     Section 10 of the PPA, 29 U.S.C. Sec. 259, provides in \n     pertinent part: [N]o employer shall be subject to any \n     liability or punishment for or on account of the failure of \n     the employer to pay minimum wages or overtime compensation \n     under the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938, as amended, * * * \n     if he pleads and proves that the act or omission complained \n     of was in good faith in conformity with and reliance on any \n     written administrative regulation, order, ruling, approval or \n     interpretation of [the Administrator of the Wage and Hour \n     Division of the Department of Labor] * * * or any \n     administrative practice or enforcement policy of such agency \n     with respect to the class of employers to which he belonged. \n     Such a defense, if established shall be a bar to the action \n     or proceeding, notwithstanding that after such act or \n     omission, such administrative regulation, order, ruling, \n     approval, interpretation, practice or enforcement policy is \n     modified or rescinded or is determined by judicial authority \n     to be invalid or of no legal effect.\n       (b) In defending any action or proceeding based on any act \n     or omission arising out of section 203 of the CAA, an \n     employing office may satisfy the standards set forth in \n     subsection (a) by pleading and proving good faith reliance \n     upon:\n       (1) Any written administrative regulation, order, decision, \n     ruling, approval or interpretation, or any administrative \n     practice or enforcement policy, of the Board.\n       (2) Any written administrative regulation, order, ruling, \n     approval or interpretation, of the Administrator of the Wage \n     and Hour Division of the Department of Labor: Provided, that \n     such regulation, order, ruling approval or interpretation had \n     not been superseded at the time of reliance by any \n     regulation, order, decision, ruling, approval or \n     interpretation, or any administrative practice or enforcement \n     policy, of the Board or the courts.\n\n\n  PART S531--WAGE PAYMENTS UNDER THE FAIR LABOR STANDARDS ACT OF 1938\n\n                     Subpart A--Preliminary Matters\n\nSec.\nS531.00 Corresponding section table of the FLSA regulations of the \n              Labor Department and the CAA regulations of the Office of \n              Compliance.\nS531.1 Definitions.\nS531.2 Purpose and scope.\n\n\nSubpart B--Determinations of ``Reasonable Cost''; Effects of Collective \n                         Bargaining Agreements\n\nS531.3 General determinations of ``reasonable cost''.\nS531.6 Effects of collective bargaining agreements.\n\n\n                     Subpart A--Preliminary Matters\n\n     Sec.

S531.1 Definitions.\n\n       (a) Administrator means the Administrator of the Wage and \n     Hour Division or his authorized representative. The Secretary \n     of Labor has delegated to the Administrator the functions \n     vested in him under section 3(m) of the Act.\n       (b) Act means the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938, as \n     amended.\n\n     Sec. S531.2 Purpose and scope.\n\n       (a) Section 3(m) of the Act defines the term ``wage'' to \n     include the ``reasonable cost', as determined by the \n     Secretary of Labor, to an employer of furnishing any employee \n     with board, lodging, or other facilities, if such board, \n     lodging, or other facilities are customarily furnished by the \n     employer to his employees. In addition, section 3(m) gives \n     the Secretary authority to determine the ``fair value'' of \n     such facilities on the basis of average cost to the employer \n     or to groups of employers similarly situated, on average \n     value to groups of employees, or other appropriate measures \n     of ``fair value'' Whenever so determined and when applicable \n     and pertinent, the ``fair value'' of the facilities involved \n     shall be includable as part of ``wages'' instead of the \n     actual measure of the costs of those facilities. The section \n     provides, however, that the cost of board, lodging, or other \n     facilities shall not be included as part of ``wages'' if \n     excluded therefrom by a bona fide collective bargaining \n     agreement. Section 3(m) also provides a method for \n     determining the wage of a tipped employee.\n       (b) This part 531 contains any determinations made as to \n     the ``reasonable cost'' and ``fair value'' of board, lodging, \n     or other facilities having general application.\n\n\n Subpart B--Determinations of ``Reasonable Cost'' and ``Fair Value''; \n              Effects of Collective Bargaining Agreements\n\n     Sec. S531.3 General determinations of ``reasonable cost.''\n\n       (a) The term reasonable cost as used in section 3(m) of the \n     Act is hereby determined to be not more than the actual cost \n     to the employer of the board, lodging, or other facilities \n     customarily furnished by him to his employees.\n       (b) Reasonable cost does not include a profit to the \n     employer or to any affiliated person.\n       (c) The reasonable cost to the employer of furnishing the \n     employee with board, lodging, or other facilities (including \n     housing) is the cost of operation and maintenance including \n     adequate depreciation plus a reasonable allowance (not more \n     than 5\\1/2\\ percent) for interest on the depreciated amount \n     of capital invested by the employer: Provided, That if the \n     total so computed is more than the fair rental value (or the \n     fair price of the commodities or facilities offered for \n     sale), the fair rental value (or the fair price of the \n     commodities or facilities offered for sale) shall be the \n     reasonable cost. The cost of operation and maintenance, the \n     rate of depreciation, and the depreciated amount of capital \n     invested by the employer shall be those arrived at under good \n     accounting practices. As used in this paragraph, the term \n     good accounting practices does not include accounting \n     practices which have been rejected by the Internal Revenue \n     Service for tax purposes, and the term depreciation includes \n     obsolescence.\n       (d)(1) The cost of furnishing ``facilities'' found by the \n     Administrator to be primarily for the benefit or convenience \n     of the employer will not be recognized as reasonable and may \n     not therefore be included in computing wages.\n       (2) The following is a list of facilities found by the \n     Administrator to be primarily for the benefit of convenience \n     of the employer. The list is intended to be illustrative \n     rather than exclusive: (i) Tools of the trade and other \n     materials and services incidental to carrying on the \n     employer's business; (ii) the cost of any construction by and \n     for the employer; \n\n[[Page S 17608]]\n     (iii) the cost of uniforms and of their laundering, where the nature of \n     the business requires the employee to wear a uniform.\n\n     Sec. S531.6 Effects of collective bargaining agreements.\n\n       (a) The cost of board, lodging, or other facilities shall \n     not be included as part of the wage paid to any employee to \n     the extent it is excluded therefrom under the terms of a bona \n     fide collective bargaining agreement applicable to the \n     particular employee.\n       (b) A collective bargaining agreement shall be deemed to be \n     ``bona fide'' when pursuant to the provisions of section \n     7(b)(1) or 7(b)(2) of the FLSA it is made with the certified \n     representative of the employees under the provisions of the \n     CAA.\n\n\n PART S541--DEFINING AND DELIMITING THE TERMS ``BONA FIDE EXECUTIVE,'' \n    ``ADMINISTRATIVE,'' OR ``PROFESSIONAL'' CAPACITY (INCLUDING ANY \nEMPLOYEE EMPLOYED IN THE CAPACITY OF ACADEMIC ADMINISTRATIVE PERSONNEL \n                    OR TEACHER IN SECONDARY SCHOOL)\n\n                     Subpart A--General Regulations\n\nSec.\nS541.00 Corresponding section table of the FLSA regulations of the \n              Labor Department and the CAA regulations of the Office of \n              Compliance.\nS541.01 Application of the exemptions of section 13(a)(1) of the FLSA.\nS541.1 Executive.\nS541.2 Administrative.\nS541.3 Professional.\nS541.5b Equal pay provisions of section 6(d) of the FLSA as applied by \n              the CAA extend to executive, administrative, and \n              professional employees.\n\n\n                     Subpart A--General Regulations\n\n     Sec.

S541.5b Equal pay provisions of section 6(d) of the FLSA \n       as applied by the CAA extend to executive, administrative, \n       and professional employees.\n\n       The FLSA, as amended and as applied by the CAA, includes \n     within the protection of the equal pay provisions those \n     employees exempt from the minimum wage and overtime pay \n     provisions as bona fide executive, administrative, and \n     professional employees (including any employee employed in \n     the capacity of academic administrative personnel or teacher \n     in elementary or secondary schools) under section 13(a)(1) of \n     the FLSA. Thus, for example, where an exempt administrative \n     employee and another employee of the employing office are \n     performing substantially ``equal work,'' the sex \n     discrimination prohibitions of section 6(d) are applicable \n     with respect to any wage differential between those two \n     employees.\n\n\n   PART S547--REQUIREMENTS OF A ``BONA FIDE THRIFT OR SAVINGS PLAN.''\n\nSec.\nS547.00 Corresponding section table of the FLSA regulations of the \n              Labor Department and the CAA regulations of the Office of \n              Compliance.\nS547.0 Scope and effect of part.\nS547.1 Essential requirements of qualifications.\nS547.2 Disqualifying provisions.\n\n     Sec.

In determining the \n     total remuneration for employment which section 7(e) of the \n     FLSA requires to be included in the regular rate at which an \n     employee is employed, it is not necessary to include any sums \n     paid to or on behalf of such employee, in recognition of \n     services performed by him during a given period, which are \n     paid pursuant to a bona fide thrift or savings plan meeting \n     the requirements set forth herein. In the formulation of \n     these regulations due regard has been given to the factors \n     and standards set forth in section 7(e)(3)(b) of the Act.\n       (b) Where a thrift or savings plan is combined in a single \n     program (whether in one or more documents) with a plan or \n     trust for providing old age, retirement, life, accident or \n     health insurance or similar benefits for employees, \n     contributions made by the employer pursuant to such thrift or \n     savings plan may be excluded from the regular rate if the \n     plan meets the requirements of the regulation in this part \n     and the contributions made for the other purposes may be \n     excluded from the regular rate if they meet the tests set \n     forth in regulations.\n\n     Sec. S547.1 Essential requirements for qualifications.\n\n       (a) A ``bona fide thrift or savings plan'' for the purpose \n     of section 7(e)(3)(b) of the FLSA as applied by the CAA is \n     required to meet all the standards set forth in paragraphs \n     (b) through (f) of this section and must not contain the \n     disqualifying provisions set forth in Sec. S547.2.\n       (b) The thrift or savings plan constitutes a definite \n     program or arrangement in writing, adopted by the employer or \n     by contract as a result of collective bargaining and \n     communicated or made available to the employees, which is \n     established and maintained, in good faith, for the purpose of \n     encouraging voluntary thrift or savings by employees by \n     providing an incentive to employees to accumulate regularly \n     and retain cash savings for a reasonable period of time or to \n     save through the regular purchase of public or private \n     securities.\n       (c) The plan specifically shall set forth the category or \n     categories of employees participating and the basis of their \n     eligibility. Eligibility may not be based on such factors as \n     hours of work, production, or efficiency of the employees: \n     Provided, however, That hours of work may be used to \n     determine eligibility of part-time or casual employees.\n       (d) The amount any employee may save under the plan shall \n     be specified in the plan or determined in accordance with a \n     definite formula specified in the plan, which formula may be \n     based on one or more factors such as the straight-time \n     earnings or total earnings, base rate of pay, or length of \n     service of the employee.\n       (e) The employer's total contribution in any year may not \n     exceed 15 percent of the participating employees' total \n     earnings during that year. In addition, the employer's total \n     contribution in any year may not exceed the total amount \n     saved or invested by the participating employees during that \n     year: Provided, however, That a plan permitting a greater \n     contribution may be submitted to the Administrator and \n     approved by him as a ``bona fide thrift or savings plan'' \n     within the meaning of section 7(e)(3)(b) of the Act if: (1) \n     The plan meets all the other standards of this section; (2) \n     The plan contains none of the disqualifying factors \n     enumerated in Sec. S547.2; (3) The employer's contribution is \n     based to a substantial degree upon retention of savings; and \n     (4) The amount of the employer's contribution bears a \n     reasonable relationship to the amount of savings retained and \n     the period of retention.\n       (f) The employer's contributions shall be apportioned among \n     the individual employees in accordance with a definite \n     formula or method of calculation specified in the plan, which \n     formula or method of calculation is based on the amount saved \n     or the length of time the individual employee retains his \n     savings or investment in the plan: Provided, That no \n     employee's share determined in accordance with the plan may \n     be diminished because of any other remuneration received by \n     him.\n\n     Sec. S547.2 Disqualifying provisions.\n\n       (a) No employee's participation in the plan shall be on \n     other than a voluntary basis.\n       (b) No employee's wages or salary shall be dependent upon \n     or influenced by the existence of such thrift or savings plan \n     or the employer's contributions thereto.\n       (c) The amounts any employee may save under the plan, or \n     the amounts paid by the employer under the plan may not be \n     based upon the employee's hours of work, production or \n     efficiency.\n\n\n                   PART S570--CHILD LABOR REGULATIONS\n\n                           SUBPART A--GENERAL\n\nSec.\nS570.00 Corresponding section table of the FLSA regulations of the \n              Labor Department and the CAA regulations of the Office of \n              Compliance.\nS570.1 Definitions.\nS570.2 Minimum age standards.\n\n\n Subpart C--Employment of Minors Between 14 and 16 Years of Age (Child \n                             Labor Reg. 3)\n\nS570.31 Determination.\nS570.32 Effect of this subpart.\nS570.33 Occupations.\nS570.35 Periods and conditions of employment.\n\n\n                           Subpart A--General\n\n     Sec.

Background\n\n                            A. Introduction\n\n       The Congressional Accountability Act of 1995 (``CAA''), PL \n     104-1, was enacted into law on January 23, 1995. In general, \n     the CAA applies the rights and protections of eleven federal \n     labor and employment law statutes to covered employees and \n     employing offices within the legislative branch. Section \n     203(a) of the CAA applies the rights and protections of \n     subsections (a)(1) and (d) of section 6, section 7, and \n     section 12(c) of the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 (29 \n     U.S.C. 206(a)(1) and (d), 207, 212(c) (``FLSA'') to covered \n     employees and employing offices. Section 203(c) of the CAA (2 \n     U.S.C. Section 1313(c)) directs the Board of Directors of the \n     Office of Compliance established under the CAA to issue \n     regulations to implement the section. Section 203(c)(2) (2 \n     U.S.C. Section 1313(c)(2)) further states that such \n     regulations, with the exception of certain irregular work \n     schedule regulations to be issued under section 203(a)(3), \n     ``shall be the same as substantive regulations issued by the \n     Secretary of Labor to implement the statutory provisions \n     referred to in subsection (a) except insofar as the Board may \n     determine, for good cause shown and stated together with the \n     regulation, that a modification of such regulations would be \n     more effective for the implementation of the rights and \n     protections under this section.''\n\n                B. Advance notice of proposed rulemaking\n\n       On September 28, 1995, the Board of the Office of \n     Compliance issued an Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking \n     (``ANPRM'') soliciting comments from interested parties in \n     order to obtain participation and information early in the \n     rulemaking process. 141 Cong. R. S14542 (daily ed., Sept. 28, \n     1995). In addition to inviting comment on specific questions \n     arising under five of the statutes made applicable by the CAA \n     in the ANPRM, the Board and the statutory appointees of the \n     Office sought consultation with the Chair of the \n     Administrative Conference of the United States, the Secretary \n     of Labor and the Director of the Office of Personnel \n     Management with regard to the development of these \n     regulations in accordance with section 304(g) of the CAA. The \n     Office has also consulted with interested parties to further \n     its understanding of the need for and content of appropriate \n     regulations. Based on the information gleaned from these \n     consultations and the comments on the ANPRM, the Board of \n     Directors of the Office of Compliance is publishing these \n     proposed rules, pursuant to Section 203(c)(1) of the CAA (2 \n     U.S.C. Section 1313(c)(1)).\n     1. Modification of the regulations of the Department of Labor\n       In the ANPRM, the Board asked the question, ``Whether and \n     to what extent should the Board modify the Secretary's \n     Regulations?'' The Board received 15 comments on the ANPRM: \n     two from Senators, four from House Members (one from the \n     leadership of the Committee with primary jurisdiction for the \n     CAA and one from three of the sponsors of the CAA), one from \n     the Secretary of the Senate and three from House offices (two \n     from institutional offices and one from a Member's Chief of \n     Staff), four from business coalitions or associations \n     representing an array of private employers, and one from a \n     labor organization.\n       Those commenters who expressed views on the ANPRM cited \n     both the statute and the legislative history in taking the \n     position that the CAA presumes that the regulations of the \n     Department of Labor should not be modified. Illustrative \n     comments included the following:\n       ``[Section 304 of the CAA] evidences clear legislative \n     intent that the Board apply these rights and protections to \n     Congressional employees in a manner comparable to and \n     consistent with the rights and protections applicable to \n     employees in the private sector under regulations adopted by \n     the Secretary (DOL). . . . The [CAA] requires that the \n     regulations issued by the Board be the same as those issued \n     by DOL unless the Board determines that modification would \n     more effectively implement the rights and protections of the \n     laws made applicable under the [CAA].''\n       ``[I]f a law is right for the private sector, it is right \n     for Congress; . . . Consistent with [this] principle, we \n     would urge the Office not to deviate (except in those few \n     areas where expressly authorized by the CAA) from applying \n     the laws in the same manner in which they are applied to the \n     private sector.\n\n                           *   *   *   *   *\n\n       [W]e have not identified any situations in which \n     modifications [of the DOL regulations] would be \n     appropriate.''\n       ``There are no circumstances that justify `good cause' for \n     adopting regulations that deviate from those currently \n     applied to private sector employers.''\n       ``[Section 203(c)(2)] confers on the Office of Compliance \n     only very limited authority to \n\n[[Page S 17611]]\n     deviate from the present DOL regulations. The legislative history to \n     the `good cause' exception likewise makes clear that this \n     authority is to be used by the Office of Compliance \n     sparingly.''\n\n                           *   *   *   *   *\n\n        ``The legislative history of the CAA demands that the \n     Office of Compliance apply to Congress the same regulations \n     as those imposed on the private sector.''\n       ``[W]e urge the Board to refrain from modifying regulations \n     promulgated by the Department of Labor and other Executive \n     agencies. Use of established regulations will provide the \n     Board, employees and employing offices with a body of \n     instructive case law and interpretive documents.''\n        ``While the Office serves an important implementation and \n     enforcement role, it must not place itself in the position of \n     shielding Congress from substantive requirements imposed on \n     private businesses.''\n       Based on the comments and the Board's understanding of the \n     law and the institutions to which it is being made \n     applicable, the Board is issuing the Secretary's regulations \n     with only these limited modifications: Technical changes in \n     the nomenclature and deletion of those sections clearly \n     inapplicable to the legislative branch.\n     2. Notice posting and recordkeeping\n       The ANPRM also invited comment on whether the recordkeeping \n     and notice posting requirements of the various laws made \n     applicable by the CAA are incorporated as statutory \n     requirements of the CAA. The ANPRM inquired whether, if such \n     requirements were not incorporated, could and should the \n     Board develop its own requirements pursuant to its ``good \n     cause'' authority. The ANPRM also invited comment on \n     proposing guidelines and models for recordkeeping and notice \n     posting.\n       Commenters were in agreement that recordkeeping and notice \n     posting are important to the effective implementation of \n     several of the statutes incorporated in the CAA. However, \n     opinions as to whether the Board should require notice \n     posting and recordkeeping were widely divergent. Several \n     commenters expressed the view that the Board lacks the \n     statutory authority to adopt notice posting and recordkeeping \n     requirements and that the notice posting and recordkeeping \n     requirements of the FLSA do not apply to Congress. Other \n     commenters expressed the view that the Board has the \n     authority to issue regulations to impose recordkeeping and \n     notice posting requirements and that such regulations should \n     be, in substance, the same as those with which the private \n     sector must comply.\n       The Board agrees with those commenters who took the \n     position that, if employing offices are to be treated the \n     same as private sector employers are treated under FLSA, they \n     should have to comply with the statute's notice posting and \n     recordkeeping requirements. Moreover, the Board notes that \n     notice posting and recordkeeping promote the full and \n     effective enforcement of these incorporated rights and \n     protections. In the Board's view, notice posting and \n     recordkeeping may well be in employers' interests both as a \n     sound personnel practice and in order to defend against \n     subsequent litigation.\n       But while the CAA incorporates certain specific sections of \n     the FLSA, the CAA explicitly did not incorporate the notice \n     posting and recordkeeping requirements of Section 11, 29 \n     U.S.C. Sec. 211 of the FLSA. Because the Board's authority to \n     modify the Secretary's regulations for ``good cause'' does \n     not authorize it to adopt regulatory requirements that are \n     the equivalent of statutory requirements that Congress has \n     omitted from the CAA, the Board has determined that it may \n     not impose such requirements on employing offices. However, \n     as various commenters suggest, the Board will provide \n     guidance to employing offices concerning model recordkeeping \n     practices as part of carrying out its program of education \n     under section 301(h) of the CAA (2 U.S.C. 1381(h)).\n       The Board would also note that based upon their collective \n     years of experience representing employers and employees \n     with regard to various labor and employment laws, \n     including the FLSA, the absence of recordkeeping and \n     notice posting requirements may create a void which can \n     only partially be filled by the program of education to be \n     carried out by the Board pursuant to Section 301(h)(1) and \n     the optional notice which will be distributed by the Board \n     pursuant to Section 301(h)(2). The Board also would \n     emphasize that employees will in many circumstances be \n     able to establish a prima facie case simply by their own \n     testimony estimating the hours worked by the employees \n     where the employing office has failed to maintain \n     adequate, accurate records. An employing office may find \n     that its ability to respond to an employee's prima facie \n     case is substantially burdened by its failure to keep \n     accurate payroll and time-records. If Congress wishes to \n     experience the same burdens as faced by the private sector \n     and also to address these issues, it should enact \n     recordkeeping requirements comparable to those of the \n     FLSA. (Of course, like the regulations under those \n     statutes, such recordkeeping requirements may leave to the \n     discretion of each employing office the precise form and \n     manner in which records will be kept.) But, in light of \n     the text and structure of the CAA, the Board believes that \n     it is up to Congress to decide whether to do so.\n\n                      II. The proposed regulations\n\n                             A. Background\n\n       Congress committed enforcement of the Fair Labor Standards \n     Act of 1938 to the Department of Labor and its Wage and Hour \n     Division, whose regulations and interpretations of that Act \n     comprise almost one thousand pages of Chapter V, Title 29 of \n     the Code of Federal Regulations. In enacting the CAA, \n     however, Congress expressly refused to commit enforcement to \n     the executive branch of the Federal government nor did \n     Congress bring its employing offices under the FLSA itself. \n     Instead, Congress carefully specified, through sectional \n     references to the FLSA, the substantive rights and \n     protections afforded to legislative employees, and precisely \n     mandated procedures by which those rights and protections \n     would be largely enforced by a new and independent office in \n     the legislative branch, the Office of Compliance. Further, in \n     granting the Board rulemaking authority with respect to the \n     FLSA in Section 203(c)(1) of the CAA, Congress affirmatively \n     commanded the Board to issue substantive regulations, with \n     the important directive that they ``shall be the same as \n     substantive regulations promulgated by the Secretary of Labor \n     * * * except as the Board may determine, for good cause shown \n     * * * that a modification of such regulations would be more \n     effective for the implementation of rights and protections \n     under'' the CAA.\n       In the Board's view, and notwithstanding what has been \n     urged by some of the commenters, this unusual statutory \n     framework neither mandates nor allows an uncritical, \n     wholesale incorporation of all the regulations and \n     interpretive statements issued by the Labor Department under \n     the FLSA. Rather, this statutory framework requires the Board \n     to cull from the vast body of FLSA material found in the Code \n     of Regulations only those items that constitute ``substantive \n     regulations'' as the term is understood under settled \n     principles of administrative law. (See Batterton v. Francis, \n     422 U.S. 416, 425, n. 9 (1977)). Moreover, the statutory \n     framework authorizes the Board to delete those substantive \n     regulations that either have no application in the employing \n     offices of the Congress or that are not likely to be invoked. \n     For these reasons, the Board is not proposing their adoption, \n     unless public comments establish a justification to the \n     contrary. Finally, by limiting itself to substantive \n     regulations, the Board is not adopting those portions of 29 \n     C.F.R. chapter V that constitute the interpretative bulletins \n     or statements of the Department of Labor and its Wage and \n     Hour Division.\n\n                        B. Proposed regulations\n\n     1. General provisions\n       The proposed regulations include an initial Part 501 which \n     contains matters of general applicability including the \n     purpose and scope of the regulations, definitions, coverage, \n     and the administrative authority of the Board and the Office \n     of Compliance. In addition, a section explains the effect of \n     interpretative bulletins and statements of the Department of \n     Labor, and another section provides for the application of \n     the Portal to Portal Act. These latter sections are discussed \n     below.\n       It is noted that the definition section incorporates the \n     general provisions of section 101 of the CAA which defines \n     ``employee,'' ``covered employee,'' ``employing office,'' and \n     ``employee of the House of Representatives.'' Section 203 of \n     the CAA, which applies the rights and protections of the \n     FLSA, also contemplates the promulgation of a definitional \n     regulation that excludes ``interns'' from the meaning of \n     ``covered employee.'' The Board in a separate NPRM issued on \n     October 11, 1995, proposed such a regulation, together with a \n     regulation governing irregular work schedules and the receipt \n     of compensatory time in lieu of overtime compensation. The \n     Board is reviewing the public comments received in response \n     to that NPRM and will issue a separate final rule on those \n     issues.\n       It should be noted that section 225(f)(1) of the CAA \n     provides that, except where inconsistent with definitions of \n     the CAA itself, the definitions in the laws made applicable \n     by the CAA shall also apply under the CAA. Thus, attention \n     must be paid to those definitions found in the FLSA that \n     are consistent with the CAA even if they are not expressly \n     incorporated in the proposed regulations. In this regard, \n     one commenter expressed concern over whether employing \n     offices would be obligated to pay minimum wages and \n     overtime compensation to individuals who do volunteer \n     work, in light of the fact that under the FLSA \n     ``employee'' may include certain volunteers. See 29 U.S.C. \n     Sec. 203(e)(4)(A), which excludes from the definition of \n     ``employee'' only certain volunteers who perform work for \n     a State, political subdivision, or interstate governmental \n     agency. Similarly, it is noted that, in enacting the CAA, \n     Congress did make separate provision for excluding \n     interns. Thus, the Board has concluded that, to the extent \n     that volunteer activity would bring an individual under \n     the coverage of the FLSA, similarly situated individuals \n     would be treated in the same manner under the CAA.\n     2. Provisions derived from regulations of the Department of \n         Labor:\n       Those regulations of the Department of Labor that are being \n     adopted in substance include:\n       Part 531, which governs the manner in which an employee's \n     wages are calculated taking into account the reasonable cost \n     to \n\n[[Page S 17612]]\n     an employer of furnishing board, lodging, or other facilities. This \n     Part is derived from Section 3(m) of the FLSA, which directs \n     how the ``wage'' paid to an employee is determined. Section \n     3(m) must be treated as applicable under the CAA by virtue of \n     Section 225(f)(1), which authorizes generally the inclusion \n     of those definitions and exemptions that are consistent with \n     definitions and exemptions of the CAA. However, it is noted \n     that section 3(m) is inconsistent with the CAA insofar as the \n     implementing regulations in Part 531, Title 29, C.F.R., \n     provide procedures by which the Wage and Hour Administrator \n     makes determinations in specific cases with respect to the \n     furnishing of board, lodging, or other facilities. Because \n     the Administrator has no role in the enforcement of the CAA \n     by reason of Section 225(f)(3), and because the Board is not \n     at this time authorizing the Office of Compliance to make \n     such specific determinations, the Board proposes to delete \n     the provisions setting forth those procedures. Similarly, the \n     reference to ``tipped employees'' and the method by which \n     their wages are determined are deleted because the applicable \n     sections assign responsibility to the Administrator.\n       Part 541, which defines and delimits the bona fide \n     executive, administrative, and professional employees who are \n     exempt under Section 13(a) of the FLSA from the minimum wage \n     and maximum hours requirements. The Board has determined that \n     this exemption, commonly known as the ``white collar'' \n     exemption, is applicable to employing offices of Congress by \n     virtue of Section 225(f)(1) of the CAA.\n       In the ANPRM, the Board solicited public comment on whether \n     and to what extent it should modify the Labor Department's \n     regulations regarding this exemption. Generally, the \n     commenters did not question the applicability of this \n     exemption to covered employees under the CAA, and several \n     commenters urged the adoption of all of the Department's \n     regulations in Part 541, 29 C.F.R., including the \n     interpretative bulletins, without any modification. Two \n     commenters contended that the Board's regulations should \n     grant a sweeping exemption for nearly all staff employees \n     working in elected members' offices because they exercise \n     independent judgment and discretion in performing their \n     responsibilities.\n       Other commenters urged the Board to modify the Labor \n     Department regulations to take into account the unique job \n     responsibilities of staff working for an elected member \n     either in a personal office, in a leadership office or on \n     committee. Recognizing that job titles alone cannot be \n     dispositive of who is an exempt employee, these commenters \n     urged the Board to identify with particularity those job \n     duties which, if performed by an employee, would render him \n     or her an exempt executive, administrative, or professional \n     employee.\n       The Board is proposing to adopt the Labor Department's \n     substantive regulations contained in Subpart A of Part 541 of \n     29 C.F.R. that set forth the fundamental criteria for \n     satisfying each of the three exemptions. But, for the reasons \n     explained below, the Board is not formally adopting the \n     interpretative bulletins contained in Subpart B of Part 541 \n     of 29 C.F.R., which discuss and illustrate through examples \n     the Department's understanding of the exemption criteria.\n       With respect to some commenters' request that the Board \n     modify the white collar exemptions, upon reflection, the \n     Board has reluctantly concluded that such a modification \n     would not satisfy the ``good cause'' requirement of Section \n     203(c)(2) of the CAA. The Board recognizes that the \n     Secretary's regulations and interpretations were promulgated \n     in a different era, with different employment paradigms in \n     mind. Thus, the Board appreciates the many difficulties that \n     employing offices will have in interpreting and reconciling \n     these regulations to present day realities. Moreover, the \n     Board is mindful of the significant impact the application of \n     the administrative, executive and professional exemption will \n     have on the structuring, functioning and expense of the \n     Members' and Senators' personal offices and committee \n     offices. However, the Board notes that private sector and \n     state and local government employers face the same \n     difficulties. And the Board has not found any sound, \n     principled basis for modifying the exemption regulation \n     for Congress and its instrumentalities. That resolved, the \n     Board nonetheless wishes to make clear its intent to \n     provide, as time and resources permit, appropriate general \n     guidance to the Congress and its instrumentalities on how \n     to identify and justify which employees are exempt. Such \n     efforts made through the Office's education and \n     information programs, will attempt to assist employing \n     offices in determining which job duties will be considered \n     exempt under the executive, administration or professional \n     criteria.\n       Part 547, which defines, pursuant to Section 7(e)(3)(b) the \n     standard that bona fide thrift or savings plans must meet in \n     order not to be included within an employee's regular rate of \n     pay for purposes of calculating overtime obligations under \n     Section 7 of the FLSA. This is included in light of Section \n     203(a)(1) of the CAA, which specifically applied the rights \n     and protections of Section 7 of the FLSA.\n       Part 570, which sets forth the limitations on the use of \n     child labor. This Part implements Section 12(c) of the FLSA, \n     prohibiting oppressive child labor, as defined by Section \n     3(l) of the same Act. The former section is specifically \n     referenced in Section 203(a)(1) of the CAA, while the latter \n     must be referenced by reason of Section 225(f)(1) of the CAA. \n     The inclusion of this Part in the separate regulations of the \n     Senate is necessitated by the fact that the Senate allows for \n     the appointment of congressional pages below the age of 16, \n     unlike the House of Representatives, which by law sets a \n     minimum age of 16 for such employees. For children under age \n     16, the FLSA regulations impose limitations on hours worked \n     during the school year. Part 570 is also included in the \n     separate regulations applicable to all other covered \n     employees and employing offices. Given the hazardous nature \n     of some of the activities of the support functions, such as \n     maintenance and repair, Part 570 regulations are being \n     proposed in the event that such instrumentalities employ \n     children under 18 years of age. It is noted that the Board \n     has not adopted regulations comparable to those set forth in \n     the Labor Department's Subpart B (29 C.F.R. Sections 570.5-\n     .27), authorizing the issuance of certificates of age. In \n     addition, with respect to Section 570.52, governing the \n     hazardous occupation of motor-vehicle driver and outside \n     helper, the Board is not adopting the special exemption for \n     school bus driving because by its terms no employing offices \n     would satisfy the criteria of the regulation.\n\n  C. Secretary of Labor's Regulations That the Board Proposes Not to \n                                 Adopt\n\n       In reviewing the remaining parts of the Labor Department's \n     regulations, it is readily apparent that some have no \n     application to the employing offices within the legislative \n     branch. For this reason, the Board is not including them \n     within its substantive regulations. Among the excluded \n     regulations are: Part 510, which pertains to the application \n     of the minimum wage provisions to Puerto Rico; Part 511, \n     establishing a wage order procedure for American Samoa; Part \n     515, authorizing the utilization of State government agencies \n     for investigations and inspections; Part 530, governing the \n     employment of industrial homeworkers in certain industries; \n     Part 549, defining the requirements of a ``bona fide profit-\n     sharing plan or trust;'' Part 550, defining the term ``talent \n     fees;'' Part 552, regulating the application of the FLSA to \n     domestic service; Part 575, addressing child labor in certain \n     agricultural employment; Parts 578, 579, and 580, \n     implementing the civil money penalties provisions of the \n     FLSA; and Part 679, dealing with industries in American \n     Samoa. Unless public comments suggest otherwise, the Board \n     intends including in the adopted regulations a provision \n     stating that the Board has issued regulations on all matters \n     for which the CAA requires a regulation. See Section 411 of \n     the CAA.\n       Other substantive regulations could have application in the \n     event that an employing office wished to avail itself of \n     certain special wage rates, subminimum wage exemptions or \n     overtime exemptions under the FLSA. These are found in: Parts \n     519-528, which authorize subminimum wages for full-time \n     students, student-learners, apprentices, learners, \n     messengers, workers with disabilities, and student workers; \n     Part 548, which authorizes in the collective bargaining \n     context the establishment of basic wage rates for overtime \n     compensation purposes; and Part 551, which implements an \n     overtime exemption for local delivery drivers and helpers. \n     Unless public comments provide a sufficient justification to \n     the contrary the Board is not proposing the adoption of \n     regulations covering the foregoing subjects.\n\n      III. The interpretive bulletins and other relevant guidance\n\n       In addition to the substantive regulations found in \n     Subchapter A, the Department of Labor has issued, under \n     Subchapter B, ``Statements of General Policy or \n     Interpretations Not Directly Related to Regulations.'' 29 \n     C.F.R Parts 775-794. Usually called Interpretive Bulletins, \n     these statements make available in one place the official \n     interpretations which guide the Secretary of Labor and the \n     Wage and Hour Administrator in the performance of their \n     duties. As the interpretations of an administering agency, \n     such statements are usually given some deference by the \n     courts. As the Supreme Court has observed:\n       ``the rulings, interpretations and opinions of the \n     Administrator under this Act, while not controlling upon the \n     courts by reason of their authority, do constitute a body of \n     experience and informed judgment to which courts and \n     litigants may properly resort for guidance. The weight of \n     such a judgment in a particular case will depend upon the \n     thoroughness evident in the consideration, the validity of \n     its reasoning its consistency with earlier and later \n     pronouncements, and all those factors which give it power to \n     persuade, if lacking power to control.''\n       Skidmore v. Swift, 323 U.S. 134, 140 (1944).\n       However, unlike ``substantive regulations,'' these \n     interpretations are not issued by the agency pursuant to its \n     statutory authority to implement the statute and, more \n     significantly, do not have the force and effect of law. See \n     Batterton v. Francis, 432 U.S. 416, 425 n.9 (1977). The \n     Board's mandate is only to issue substantive regulations that \n     are ``the same as the substantive regulations of the \n     Secretary of Labor to implement the statutory provision [of \n     the FLSA] applied'' by Section 204(a) of the CAA unless \n     modified for good cause (CAA Section 203 (c)(2)). Therefore, \n     the Board, does not propose to adopt the non-substantive \n     interpretations of the DOL and its Wage and Hour Division as \n     substantive regulations under the CAA. \n\n[[Page S 17613]]\n      Moreover, the Board is not proposing to issue the Department's \n     interpretations as its own interpretations of the FLSA rights \n     and protections made applicable under the CAA at this time. \n     However, as discussed below, employing offices should be \n     advised that, pursuant to the Portal to Portal Act, the Board \n     will give due consideration the Secretary's interpretations \n     of the FLSA.\n       Application of the Portal to Portal Act.--The Portal to \n     Portal Act, 61 Stat. 84 (1947), codified generally at 29 \n     U.S.C. Sections 216 and 251, et seq. (``PPA''), contains \n     provisions which affect the rights and liabilities of \n     employees and employers with regard to alleged underpayment \n     of minimum or overtime wages under the FLSA. Section 4 of the \n     PPA excludes from the definition of hours worked both \n     activities preliminary to or postliminary to the worker's \n     principal activities and travel time absent a contract, \n     custom or practice to the contrary. 29 U.S.C. Section 254. \n     Sections 9 and 10 of the PPA provide the employer with a \n     defense against liability or punishment in any action or \n     proceeding brought against it for failure to comply with the \n     minimum wage and overtime provisions of the FLSA, where the \n     employer pleads and proves that the act or omission \n     complained of was in good faith in conformity with and in \n     reliance on any regulation, order, ruling, approval, \n     interpretation, administrative practice or enforcement policy \n     of the Wage and Hour Administrator of the Department of \n     Labor. 29 U.S.C. Sections 258-259. The PPA also contains \n     provisions which restrict and limit employee suits under \n     section 16(b) of the FLSA. For example, section 11 of the PPA \n     provides that in any action brought under section 216 of the \n     FLSA, the court may in its discretion, subject to prescribed \n     conditions, award no liquidated damages or award any amount \n     of such damages not to exceed the amount specified in section \n     16(b) of the FLSA. 29 U.S.C. Section 260.\n       The Board has determined that the above provisions of the \n     PPA are incorporated into section 203 of the CAA, either as \n     an amendment to section 16(b) of the FLSA (which is expressly \n     applied to the legislative branch under section 203(b) of the \n     CAA), or by virtue of section 225(f) of the CAA, which \n     applies the definitions and exemptions of the FLSA to the \n     extent not inconsistent with the CAA. To that end, the Board \n     will give due consideration to the interpretations of the \n     FLSA of the Secretary of Labor. Moreover, employing offices \n     may utilize these interpretations in attempting to understand \n     the rights and protections under the FLSA that have been made \n     applicable by the CAA. Unless and until the Secretary's \n     interpretive statements are superseded or interpretative \n     guidance or decisions to the contrary are issued by the Board \n     or the courts, they may be relied upon for purposes of \n     defending against claims brought under the CAA to the same \n     extent as private sector employers may properly rely upon \n     them in actions brought under the FLSA.\n       Joint Employer Doctrine.--The Board solicited comments in \n     the ANPRM on whether and to what extent the joint employment \n     doctrine as developed under the FLSA is applicable under the \n     CAA. The comments generally advocated adoption of the \n     doctrine to employing offices of the Congress. However, since \n     the issue of joint employment is addressed through a DOL \n     interpretive bulletin set forth in Part 791, 29 C.F.R., \n     rather than a substantive regulation, the Board is not \n     adopting it as such nor issuing it as its own interpretive \n     statement. See discussion at Section III.\n       Equal Pay Act.--With respect to the Equal Pay Act (EPA), \n     which is included in Section 6(d) of the FLSA, 29 U.S.C. \n     Section 206(d), the Secretary of Labor promulgated \n     interpretative regulations that were originally included in \n     29 C.F.R. Part 800. Pursuant to the provisions of \n     Reorganization Plan No. 1 of 1978, as confirmed by the \n     Congress in Public Law 98-532, 98 Stat. 2705 (1984), \n     enforcement and administration of the EPA was transferred \n     from the Secretary of Labor to the Equal Employment \n     Opportunity Commission (EEOC). The EEOC promulgated its \n     own interpretations implementing the EPA at 29 C.F.R. Part \n     1620. Thereafter, the Secretary deleted its \n     interpretations. 52 FR 2517 (Jan. 23, 1987). Thus, there \n     are no substantive regulations implementing the EPA. Under \n     the rationale previously stated regarding the Portal to \n     Portal Act, the Board declines to incorporate the EEOC \n     interpretations as substantive regulations under the CAA \n     but will recognize them as is appropriate.\n       Opinion Letters.--Commenters asked that the Board consider \n     establishing a process under which the Office or the Board \n     would issue opinion letters and upon which employing offices \n     could rely, similar to the procedure followed by the Wage and \n     Hour Administrator in sometimes providing such opinions at \n     the request of private sector employers. The Board \n     understands employing offices' desire for guidance and \n     clarity regarding their obligations under the CAA.\n       To the extent that the Board itself can address issues \n     through regulations or interpretations, it will do so. \n     Moreover, the Office intends to provide appropriate education \n     and technical assistance as part of its education and \n     information responsibilities. But for the reasons stated \n     here, the Board and the Office's ability to do so is limited \n     by legal, resource and policy considerations. As is the case \n     in the private sector context, many issues under these \n     statutes can only be definitively resolved through case-by-\n     case adjudication on particular facts. Moreover, except in \n     the context of statutes subject to the Portal to Portal Act, \n     it is doubtful that the Board or the Office has the statutory \n     authority to issue guidance with legal effect (outside of the \n     adjudicatory or rulemaking contexts); we are not aware of any \n     such legal authorization for Executive Branch agencies to do \n     so in the context of applying these same laws to the private \n     sector. Further, the resources of the Board and the Office \n     are limited: the first year appropriation is for $2.5 \n     million. These resources are substantially less than those \n     available to analogous Executive Branch agencies that \n     administer fewer laws. Finally, public comment has not \n     provided the Board with the facts necessary for yet making \n     any of these determinations--and a detailed evidentiary \n     record is necessary for such judgment to be made. In short, \n     particularly in light of the various statutory \n     responsibilities of the Office and the Board, it is not \n     possible to give answers with legal effect to each individual \n     request for information and guidance. While the Board will \n     structure education and information programs to assist \n     employees and employing offices, it is forced to respond \n     that, like private employers, employing offices will \n     generally have to rely on their own counsel and human \n     resource advisors in determining their compliance with the \n     Congressional Accountability Act.\n\n                         IV. Method of approval\n\n       The Board recommends that (1) the version of the proposed \n     regulations that shall apply to the Senate and employees of \n     the Senate be approved by the Senate by resolution; (2) the \n     version of the proposed regulations that shall apply to the \n     House of Representatives and employees of the House of \n     Representatives be approved by the House of Representatives \n     by resolution; and (3) the version of the proposed \n     regulations that shall apply to other covered employees and \n     employing offices be approved by the Congress by concurrent \n     resolution.\n       Signed at Washington, D.C., on this 21st day of November, \n     1995.\n\n                                                Glen D.

H501.00 Corresponding section table of the FLSA \n       regulations of the Labor Department and the CAA regulations \n       of the Office of Compliance.\n\n       The following table lists the parts of the Secretary of \n     Labor Regulations at Title 29 of the Code of Federal \n     Regulations under the FLSA with the corresponding parts of \n     the Office of Compliance (CO) Regulations under Section 203 \n     of the CAA:\n       Secretary of Labor Regulations--OC Regulations.\n       Part 531: Wage payments under the Fair Labor Standards Act \n     of 1938--Part H531.\n       Part 541: Defining and delimiting the terms ``bona fide \n     executive,'' ``administrative,'' and ``professional'' \n     employees--Part H541.\n       Part 547 Requirements of a ``Bona fide thrift or savings \n     plan''--Part H547.\n\n\n              Subpart A--Matters of General Applicability\n\n     Sec. H501.101 Purpose and scope.\n\n       (a) Section 203 of the Congressional Accountability Act \n     (CAA) provides that the rights and protections of subsections \n     (a)(1) and (d) of section 6, section 7, and section 12(c) of \n     the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 (FLSA) (29 U.S.C. \n     Sec. Sec. 206(a)(1) & (d), 207, 212(c)) shall apply to \n     covered employees of the legislative branch of the Federal \n     government. Section 301 of the CAA creates the Office of \n     Compliance as an independent office in the legislative branch \n     for enforcing the rights and protections of the FLSA, as \n     applied by the CAA.\n       (b) The FLSA as applied by the CAA provides for minimum \n     standards for both wages and overtime entitlements, and \n     delineates administrative procedures by which covered \n     worktime must be compensated. Included also in the FLSA are \n     provisions related to child labor, equal pay, and portal-to-\n     portal activities. In addition, the FLSA exempts specified \n     employees or groups of employees from the application of \n     certain of its provisions.\n       (c) This chapter contains the substantive regulations with \n     respect to the FLSA that the Board of Directors of the Office \n     of Compliance has adopted pursuant to Sections 203(c) and 304 \n     of the CAA, which require that the Board promulgate \n     regulations that are ``the same as substantive regulations \n     promulgated by the Secretary of Labor to implement the \n     statutory provisions referred to in subsection (a) [of \n     Sec. 203 of the CAA] except insofar as the Board may \n     determine, for good \n\n[[Page S 17614]]\n     cause shown . . . that a modification of such regulations would be more \n     effective for the implementation of the rights and \n     protections under this section.''\n\n     Sec. H501.102 Definitions.\n\n       For purposes of this chapter:\n       (a) CAA means the Congressional Accountability Act of 1995 \n     (P.L. 104-1, 109 Stat. 3, 2 U.S.C. Sec. Sec. 1301-1438).\n       (b) FLSA or Act means the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938, \n     as amended (29 U.S.C. Sec. 201 et seq.).\n       (c) Covered employee means any employee of the House of \n     Representatives, including an applicant for employment and a \n     former employee.\n       (d) Employee of the House of Representatives includes any \n     individual occupying a position the pay for which is \n     disbursed by the Clerk of the House of Representatives, or \n     another official designated by the House of Representatives, \n     or any employment position in an entity that is paid with \n     funds derived from the clerk-hire allowance of the House of \n     Representatives but not any such individual employed by (1) \n     the Capitol Guide Service; (2) the Capitol Police; (3) the \n     Congressional Budget Office; (4) the Office of the Architect \n     of the Capitol; (5) the Office of the Attending Physician; \n     (6) the Office of Compliance; or (7) the Office of Technology \n     Assessment.\n       (e) Employing office and employer mean (1) the personal \n     office of a Member of the House of Representatives; (2) a \n     committee of the House of Representatives or a joint \n     committee; or (3) any other office headed by a person with \n     the final authority to appoint, hire, discharge, and set the \n     terms, conditions, or privileges of the employment of an \n     employee of the House of Representatives.\n       (f) Board means the Board of Directors of the Office of \n     Compliance.\n       (g) Office means the Office of Compliance.\n\n     Sec. H501.103 Coverage.\n\n       The coverage of Section 203 of the CAA extends to any \n     covered employee of an employing office without regard to \n     whether the covered employee is engaged in commerce or the \n     production of goods for interstate commerce and without \n     regard to size, number of employees, amount of business \n     transacted, or other measure.\n\n     Sec. H501.104 Administrative authority.\n\n       (a) The Office of Compliance is authorized to administer \n     the provisions of Section 203 of the Act with respect to any \n     covered employee or covered employer.\n       (b) The Board is authorized to promulgate substantive \n     regulations in accordance with the provisions of Sections \n     203(c) and 304 of the CAA.\n       (c) The Board may in its discretion from time to time issue \n     interpretative statements providing guidance to employees and \n     to employing offices on the rights and protections \n     established under the FLSA that are made applicable by \n     Sections 203(a) and 225 of the CAA.\n\n     Sec. H501.105 Effect of Interpretations of the Department of \n       Labor.\n\n       (a) In administering the FLSA, the Wage and Hour Division \n     of the Department of Labor has issued not only substantive \n     regulations but also interpretative bulletins. Substantive \n     regulations represent an exercise of statutorily-delegated \n     lawmaking authority from the legislative branch to an \n     administrative agency. Generally, they are proposed in \n     accordance with the notice-and-comment procedures of the \n     Administrative Procedure Act (APA), 5 U.S.C. Sec. 553. Once \n     promulgated, such regulations are considered to have the \n     force and effect of law, unless set aside upon judicial \n     review as arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or \n     otherwise not in accordance with law. See Batterton v. \n     Francis, 432 U.S. 416, 425 n.9 (1977). See also 29 C.F.R. \n     Sec. 790.17(b) (1994). Unlike substantive regulations, \n     interpretative statements, including bulletins and other \n     releases of the Wage and Hour Division, are not issued \n     pursuant to the provisions of the APA and may not have the \n     force and effect of law. Rather, they may only constitute \n     official interpretations of the Department of Labor with \n     respect to the meaning and application of the minimum wage, \n     maximum hour, and overtime pay requirements of the FLSA. See \n     29 C.F.R. Sec. 790.17(c) (citing Final Report of the Attorney \n     General's Committee on Administrative Procedure, Senate \n     Document No. 8, 77th Cong., 1st Sess., at p. 27 (1941)). The \n     purpose of such statements is to make available in one place \n     the interpretations of the FLSA which will guide the \n     Secretary of Labor and the Wage and Hour Administrator in the \n     performance of their duties unless and until they are \n     otherwise directed by authoritative decisions of the courts \n     or conclude, upon reexamination of an interpretation, that it \n     is incorrect. The Supreme Court has observed: ``[T]he \n     rulings, interpretations and opinions of the Administrator \n     under this Act, while not controlling upon the courts by \n     reason of their authority, do constitute a body of experience \n     and informed judgment to which courts and litigants may \n     properly resort for guidance. The weight of such a judgment \n     in a particular case will depend upon the thoroughness \n     evident in the consideration, the validity of its reasoning, \n     its consistency with earlier and later pronouncements, and \n     all those factors which give it power to persuade, if lacking \n     power to control.'' Skidmore v. Swift, 323 U.S. 134, 140 \n     (1944).\n       (b) Section 203(c) of the CAA provides that the substantive \n     regulations implementing Section 203 of the CAA shall be \n     ``the same as substantive regulations promulgated by the \n     Secretary of Labor'' except where the Board finds, for good \n     cause shown, that a modification would more effectively \n     implement the rights and protections established by the FLSA. \n     Thus, the CAA by its terms does not mandate that the Board \n     adopt the interpretative statements of the Department of \n     Labor or its Wage and Hour Division. The Board is thus not \n     adopting such statements as part of its substantive \n     regulations.\n\n     Sec. H501.106 Application of the Portal-to-Portal Act of \n       1947.\n\n       (a) Consistent with Section 225 of the CAA, the Portal to \n     Portal Act (PPA), 29 U.S.C. Sec. Sec. 216 and 251 et seq., is \n     applicable in defining and delimiting the rights and \n     protections of the FLSA that are prescribed by the CAA. \n     Section 10 of the PPA, 29 U.S.C. Sec. 259, provides in \n     pertinent part:\n       [N]o employer shall be subject to any liability or \n     punishment for or on account of the failure of the employer \n     to pay minimum wages or overtime compensation under the Fair \n     Labor Standards Act of 1938, as amended, . . . if he pleads \n     and proves that the act or omission complained of was in good \n     faith in conformity with and reliance on any written \n     administrative regulation, order, ruling, approval or \n     interpretation of [the Administrator of the Wage and Hour \n     Division of the Department of Labor] . . . or any \n     administrative practice or enforcement policy of such agency \n     with respect to the class of employers to which he belonged. \n     Such a defense, if established shall be a bar to the action \n     or proceeding, notwithstanding that after such act or \n     omission, such administrative regulation, order, ruling, \n     approval, interpretation, practice or enforcement policy is \n     modified or rescinded or is determined by judicial authority \n     to be invalid or of no legal effect.\n       (b) In defending any action or proceeding based on any act \n     or omission arising out of section 203 of the CAA, an \n     employing office may satisfy the standards set forth in \n     subsection (a) by pleading and proving good faith reliance \n     upon:\n       (1) Any written administrative regulation, order, decision, \n     ruling, approval or interpretation, or any administrative \n     practice or enforcement policy, of the Board.\n       (2) Any written administrative regulation, order, ruling, \n     approval or interpretation, of the Administrator of the Wage \n     and Hour Division of the Department of Labor: Provided, that \n     such regulation, order, ruling, approval or interpretation \n     had not been superseded at the time of reliance by any \n     regulation, order, decision, ruling, approval or \n     interpretation, or any administrative practice or enforcement \n     policy, of the Board or the courts.\n\n\n  PART H531--WAGE PAYMENTS UNDER THE FAIR LABOR STANDARDS ACT OF 1938\n\n                     Subpart A--Preliminary Matters\n\nSec.\nH531.00 Corresponding section table of the FLSA regulations of the \n              Labor Department and the CAA regulations of the Office of \n              Compliance.\nH531.1 Definitions.\nH531.2 Purpose and scope.\n\n\nSubpart B--Determinations of ``Reasonable Cost;'' Effects of Collective \n                         Bargaining Agreements\n\nH531.3 General determinations of `reasonable cost'.\nH531.6 Effects of collective bargaining agreements.\n\n\n                    Subpart A--Preliminary Matters.\n\n     Sec.

H531.1 Definitions.\n\n       (a) Administrator means the Administrator of the Wage and \n     Hour Division or his authorized representative. The Secretary \n     of Labor has delegated to the Administrator the functions \n     vested in him under section 3(m) of the Act.\n       (b) Act means the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938, as \n     amended.\n\n     Sec. H531.2 Purpose and scope.\n\n       (a) Section 3(m) of the Act defines the term `wage' to \n     include the `reasonable cost', as determined by the Secretary \n     of Labor, to an employer of furnishing any employee with \n     board, lodging, or other facilities, if such board, lodging, \n     or other facilities are customarily furnished by the employer \n     to his employees. In addition, section 3(m) gives the \n     Secretary authority to determine the `fair value.' of such \n     facilities on the basis of average cost to the employer or to \n     groups of employers similarly situated, on average value to \n     groups of employees, or other appropriate measures of `fair \n     value.' Whenever so determined and when applicable and \n     pertinent, the `fair value' of the facilities involved shall \n     be includable as part of `wages' instead of the actual \n     measure of the costs of \n\n[[Page S 17615]]\n     those facilities. The section provides, however, that the cost of \n     board, lodging, or other facilities shall not be included as \n     part of `wages' if excluded therefrom by a bona fide \n     collective bargaining agreement. Section 3(m) also provides a \n     method for determining the wage of a tipped employee.\n       (b) This part 531 contains any determinations made as to \n     the `reasonable cost' and `fair value' of board, lodging, or \n     other facilities having general application.\n\n\n Subpart B--Determinations of ``Reasonable Cost'' and ``Fair Value''; \n              Effects of Collective Bargaining Agreements\n\n     Sec. H531.3 General determinations of `reasonable cost.'\n\n       (a) The term reasonable cost as used in section 3(m) of the \n     Act is hereby determined to be not more than the actual cost \n     to the employer of the board, lodging, or other facilities \n     customarily furnished by him to his employees.\n       (b) Reasonable cost does not include a profit to the \n     employer or to any affiliated person.\n       (c) The reasonable cost to the employer of furnishing the \n     employee with board, lodging, or other facilities (including \n     housing) is the cost of operation and maintenance including \n     adequate depreciation plus a reasonable allowance (not more \n     than 5\\1/2\\ percent) for interest on the depreciated amount \n     of capital invested by the employer: Provided, That if the \n     total so computed is more than the fair rental value (or the \n     fair price of the commodities or facilities offered for \n     sale), the fair rental value (or the fair price of the \n     commodities or facilities offered for sale) shall be the \n     reasonable cost. The cost of operation and maintenance, the \n     rate of depreciation, and the depreciated amount of capital \n     invested by the employer shall be those arrived at under good \n     accounting practices. As used in this paragraph, the term \n     good accounting practices does not include accounting \n     practices which have been rejected by the Internal Revenue \n     Service for tax purposes, and the term depreciation includes \n     obsolescence.\n       (d)(1) The cost of furnishing `facilities' found by the \n     Administrator to be primarily for the benefit or convenience \n     of the employer will not be recognized as reasonable and may \n     not therefore be included in computing wages.\n       (2) The following is a list of facilities found by the \n     Administrator to be primarily for the benefit of convenience \n     of the employer. The list is intended to be illustrative \n     rather than exclusive: (i) Tools of the trade and other \n     materials and services incidental to carrying on the \n     employer's business; (ii) the cost of any construction by and \n     for the employer; (iii) the cost of uniforms and of their \n     laundering, where the nature of the business requires the \n     employee to wear a uniform.\n\n     Sec. H531.6 Effects of collective bargaining agreements.\n\n       (a) The cost of board, lodging, or other facilities shall \n     not be included as part of the wage paid to any employee to \n     the extent it is excluded therefrom under the terms of a bona \n     fide collective bargaining agreement applicable to the \n     particular employee.\n       (b) A collective bargaining agreement shall be deemed to be \n     `bona fide' when pursuant to the provisions of section \n     7(b)(1) or 7(b)(2) of the FLSA it is made with the certified \n     representative of the employees under the provisions of the \n     CAA.\n\n\n PART H541--DEFINING AND DELIMITING THE TERMS ``BONA FIDE EXECUTIVE,'' \n    ``ADMINISTRATIVE,'' OR ``PROFESSIONAL'' CAPACITY (INCLUDING ANY \nEMPLOYEE EMPLOYED IN THE CAPACITY OF ACADEMIC ADMINISTRATIVE PERSONNEL \n                    OR TEACHER IN SECONDARY SCHOOL).\n\n                    subpart a--general regulations.\n\n\n H541.00 Corresponding section table of the FLSA regulations of the \n              Labor Department and the CAA regulations of the Office of \n              Compliance.\nH541.01 Application of the exemptions of section 13(a)(1) of the FLSA.\nH541.1 Executive.\nH541.2 Administrative.\nH541.3 Professional.\nH541.5b Equal pay provisions of section 6(d) of the FLSA as applied by \n              the CAA extend to executive, administrative, and \n              professional employees.\n\n\n                    subpart a--general regulations.\n\n     Sec.

H541.5b Equal pay provisions of section 6(d) of the FLSA \n       as applied by the CAA extend to executive, administrative, \n       and professional employees.\n\n       The FLSA, as amended and as applied by the CAA, includes \n     within the protection of the equal pay provisions those \n     employees exempt from the minimum wage and overtime pay \n     provisions as bona fide executive, administrative, and \n     professional employees (including any employee employed in \n     the capacity of academic administrative personnel or teacher \n     in elementary or secondary schools) under section 13(a)(1) of \n     the FLSA. Thus, for example, where an exempt administrative \n     employee and another employee of the employing office are \n     performing substantially ``equal work,'' the sex \n     discrimination prohibitions of section 6(d) are applicable \n     with respect to any wage differential between those two \n     employees.\n\n\n   PART H547--REQUIREMENTS OF A ``BONA FIDE THRIFT OR SAVINGS PLAN.''\n\nSec.\nH547.00 Corresponding section table of the FLSA regulations of the \n              Labor Department and the CAA regulations of the Office of \n              Compliance.\nH547.0 Scope and effect of part.\nH547.1 Essential requirements of qualifications.\nH547.2 Disqualifying provisions.\n\n     Sec.

H547.0 Scope and effect of part.\n\n       (a) The regulations in this part set forth the requirements \n     of a ``bona fide thrift or savings plan'' under section \n     7(e)(3)(b) of the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938, as \n     amended (FLSA), as applied by the CAA. In determining the \n     total remuneration for employment which section 7(e) of the \n     FLSA requires to be included in the regular rate at which an \n     employee is employed, it is not necessary to include any sums \n     paid to or on behalf of such employee, in recognition of \n     services performed by him during a given period, which are \n     paid pursuant to a bona fide thrift or savings plan meeting \n     the requirements set forth herein. In the formulation of \n     these regulations due regard has been given to the factors \n     and standards set forth in section 7(e)(3)(b) of the Act.\n       (b) Where a thrift or savings plan is combined in a single \n     program (whether in one or more documents) with a plan or \n     trust for providing old age, retirement, life, accident or \n     health insurance or similar benefits for employees, \n     contributions made by the employer pursuant to such thrift or \n     savings plan may be excluded from the regular rate if the \n     plan meets the requirements of the regulation in this part \n     and the contributions made for the other purposes may be \n     excluded from the regular rate if they meet the tests set \n     forth in regulations.\n\n     Sec. H547.1 Essential requirements for qualifications.\n\n       (a) A ``bona fide thrift or savings plan'' for the purpose \n     of section 7(e)(3)(b) of the FLSA as applied by the CAA is \n     required to meet all the standards set forth in paragraphs \n     (b) through (f) of this section and must not contain the \n     disqualifying provisions set forth in Sec. H547.2.\n       (b) The thrift or savings plan constitutes a definite \n     program or arrangement in writing, adopted by the employer or \n     by contract as a result of collective bargaining and \n     communicated or made available to the employees, which is \n     established and maintained, in good faith, for the purpose of \n     encouraging voluntary thrift or savings by employees by \n     providing an incentive to employees to accumulate regularly \n     and retain cash savings for a reasonable period of time or to \n     save through the regular purchase of public or private \n     securities.\n       (c) The plan specifically shall set forth the category or \n     categories of employees participating and the basis of their \n     eligibility. Eligibility may not be based on such factors as \n     hours of work, production, or efficiency of the employees: \n     Provided, however, That hours of work may be used to \n     determine eligibility of part-time or casual employees.\n       (d) The amount any employee may save under the plan shall \n     be specified in the plan or determined in accordance with a \n     definite formula specified in the plan, which formula may be \n     based on one or more factors such as the straight-time \n     earnings or total earnings, base rate of pay, or length of \n     service of the employee.\n       (e) The employer's total contribution in any year may not \n     exceed 15 percent of the participating employees' total \n     earnings during that year. In addition, the employer's total \n     contribution in any year may not exceed the total amount \n     saved or invested by the participating employees during that \n     year: Provided, however, That a plan permitting a greater \n     contribution may be submitted to the Administrator and \n     approved by him as a `bona fide thrift or savings plan' \n     within the meaning of section 7(e)(3)(b) of the Act if: (1) \n     The plan meets all the other standards of this section; (2) \n     The plan contains none of the disqualifying factors \n     enumerated in Sec. H547.2; (3) The employer's contribution is \n     based to a substantial degree upon retention of savings; and \n     (4) The amount of the employer's contribution bears a \n     reasonable relationship to the amount of savings retained and \n     the period of retention.\n       (f) The employer's contributions shall be apportioned among \n     the individual employees in accordance with a definite \n     formula or method of calculation specified in the plan, which \n     formula or method of calculation is based on the amount saved \n     or the length of time the individual employee retains his \n     savings or investment in the plan: Provided, That no \n     employee's share determined in accordance with the plan may \n     be diminished because of any other remuneration received by \n     him.\n\n     Sec. H547.2 Disqualifying provisions.\n\n       (a) No employee's participation in the plan shall be on \n     other than a voluntary basis.\n       (b) No employee's wages or salary shall be dependent upon \n     or influenced by the existence of such thrift or savings plan \n     or the employer's contributions thereto.\n       (c) The amounts any employee may save under the plan, or \n     the amounts paid by the employer under the plan may not be \n     based upon the employee's hours of work, production or \n     efficiency.\n\n\nproposed regulations relating to the employing offices other than those \n             of the senate and the house of representatives\n\n                          office of compliance\n\n       The Congressional Accountability Act of 1995: Extension of \n     Rights and Protections Under the Fair Labor Standards Act of \n     1938 (Notices of Proposed Rulemaking with respect to Interns \n     and Irregular Work Schedules were issued on October 11.

Background\n\n                            A. Introduction\n\n       The Congressional Accountability Act of 1995 (``CAA''), PL \n     104-1, was enacted into law on January 23, 1995. In general, \n     the CAA applies the rights and protections of eleven federal \n     labor and employment law statutes to covered employees and \n     employing offices within the legislative branch. Section \n     203(a) of the CAA applies the rights and protections of \n     subsections (a)(1) and (d) of section 6, section 7, and \n     section 12(c) of the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 (29 \n     U.S.C. 206 (a)(1) and (d), 207, 212(c) (``FLSA'') to covered \n     employees and employing offices. Section 203(c) of the CAA (2 \n     U.S.C. Section 1313(c)) directs the Board of Directors of the \n     Office of Compliance established under the CAA to issue \n     regulations to implement the section. Section 203(c)(2) (2 \n     U.S.C. Section 1313(c)(2)) further states that such \n     regulations, with the exception of certain irregular work \n     schedule regulations to be issued under section 203(a)(3), \n     ``shall be the same as substantive regulations issued by the \n     Secretary of Labor to implement the statutory provisions \n     referred to in subsection (a) except insofar as the Board may \n     determine, for good cause shown and stated together with the \n     regulation, that a modification of such regulations would be \n     more effective for the implementation of the rights and \n     protections under this section.''\n\n                B. Advance notice of proposed rulemaking\n\n       On September 28, 1995, the Board of the Office of \n     Compliance issued an Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking \n     (``ANPRM'') soliciting comments from interested parties in \n     order to obtain participation and information early in the \n     rulemaking process. 141 Cong. R. S14542 (daily ed., Sept. 28, \n     1995). In addition to inviting comment on specific questions \n     arising under five of the statutes made applicable by the CAA \n     in the ANPRM, the Board and the statutory appointees of the \n     Office sought consultation with the Chair of the \n     Administrative Conference of the United States, the Secretary \n     of Labor and the Director of the Office of Personnel \n     Management with regard to the development of these \n     regulations in accordance with section 304(g) of the CAA. The \n     Office has also consulted with interested parties to further \n     its understanding of the need for and content of appropriate \n     regulations. Based on the information gleaned from these \n     consultations and the comments on the ANPRM, the Board of \n     Directors of the Office of Compliance is publishing these \n     proposed rules, pursuant to Section 203(c)(1) of the CAA (2 \n     U.S.C. Section 1313(c)(1)).\n     1. Modification of the regulations of the Department of Labor\n       In the ANPRM, the Board asked the question, ``Whether and \n     to what extent should the Board modify the Secretary's \n     Regulations?'' The Board received 15 comments on the ANPRM: \n     two from Senators, four from House Members (one from the \n     leadership of the Committee with primary jurisdiction for the \n     CAA and one from three of the sponsors of the CAA), one from \n     the Secretary of the Senate and three from House offices (two \n     from institutional offices and one from a Member's Chief of \n     Staff), four from business coalitions or associations \n     representing an array of private employers, and one from a \n     labor organization.\n       Those commenters who expressed views on the ANPRM cited \n     both the statute and the legislative history in taking the \n     position that the CAA presumes that the regulations of the \n     Department of Labor should not be modified. Illustrative \n     comments included the following:\n       ``[Section 304 of the CAA] evidences clear legislative \n     intent that the Board apply these rights and protections to \n     Congressional employees in a manner comparable to and \n     consistent with the rights and protections applicable to \n     employees in the private sector under regulations adopted by \n     the Secretary (DOL). . . . The [CAA] requires that the \n     regulations issued by the Board be the same as those issued \n     by DOL unless the Board determines that modification would \n     more effectively implement the rights and protections of the \n     laws made applicable under the [CAA].''\n       ``[I]f a law is right for the private sector, it is right \n     for Congress; . . . . Consistent with [this] principle, we \n     would urge the Office not to deviate (except in those few \n     areas where expressly authorized by the CAA) from applying \n     the laws in the same manner in which they are applied to the \n     private sector.\n\n                           *   *   *   *   *\n\n       [W]e have not identified any situations in which \n     modifications [of the DOL regulations] would be \n     appropriate.''\n       ``There are no circumstances that justify `good cause' for \n     adopting regulations that deviate from those currently \n     applied to private sector employers.''\n       ``[Section 203(c)(2)] confers on the Office of Compliance \n     only very limited authority to deviate from the present DOL \n     regulations. The legislative history to the `good cause' \n     exception likewise makes clear that this authority is to be \n     used by the Office of Compliance sparingly.''\n\n                           *   *   *   *   *\n\n        ``The legislative history of the CAA demands that the \n     Office of Compliance apply to Congress the same regulations \n     as those imposed on the private sector.''\n        ``[W]e urge the Board to refrain from modifying \n     regulations promulgated by the Department of Labor and other \n     Executive agencies. Use of established regulations will \n     provide the Board, employees and employing offices with a \n     body of instructive case law and interpretive documents.''\n        ``While the Office serves an important implementation and \n     enforcement role, it must not place itself in the position of \n     shielding Congress from substantive requirements imposed on \n     private businesses.''\n       Based on the comments and the Board's understanding of the \n     law and the institutions to which it is being made \n     applicable, the Board is issuing the Secretary's regulations \n     with only these limited modifications: Technical changes in \n     the nomenclature and deletion of those sections clearly \n     inapplicable to the legislative branch.\n      2. Notice Posting and Recordkeeping\n        The ANPRM also invited comment on whether the \n     recordkeeping and notice posting requirements of the various \n     laws made applicable by the CAA are incorporated as statutory \n     requirements of the CAA. The ANPRM inquired whether, if such \n     requirements were not incorporated, could and should the \n     Board develop its own requirements pursuant to its ``good \n     cause'' authority. The ANPRM also invited comment on \n     proposing guidelines and models for recordkeeping and notice \n     posting.\n        Commenters were in agreement that recordkeeping and notice \n     posting are important to the effective implementation of \n     several of the statutes incorporated in the CAA. However, \n     opinions as to whether the Board should require notice \n     posting and recordkeeping were widely divergent. Several \n     commenters expressed the view that the Board lacks the \n     statutory authority to adopt notice posting and recordkeeping \n     requirements and that the notice posting and recordkeeping \n     requirements of the FLSA do not apply to Congress. Other \n     commenters expressed the view that the Board has the \n     authority to issue regulations to impose recordkeeping and \n     notice posting requirements and that such regulations should \n     be, in substance, the same as those with which the private \n     sector must comply.\n        The Board agrees with those commenters who took the \n     position that, if employing offices are to be treated the \n     same as private sector employers are treated under FLSA, they \n     should have to comply with the statute's notice posting and \n     recordkeeping requirements. Moreover, the Board notes that \n     notice posting and recordkeeping promote the full and \n     effective enforcement of these incorporated rights and \n     protections. In the Board's view, notice posting and \n     recordkeeping may well be in employers' interests both as a \n     sound personnel practice and in order to defend against \n     subsequent litigation.\n        But while the CAA incorporates certain specific sections \n     of the FLSA, the CAA explicitly did not incorporate the \n     notice posting and recordkeeping requirements of Section 11, \n     29 U.S.C. Sec. 211 of the FLSA. Because the Board's authority \n     to modify the Secretary's regulations for ``good cause'' does \n     not authorize it to adopt regulatory requirements that are \n     the equivalent of statutory requirements that Congress has \n     omitted from the CAA, the Board has determined that it may \n     not impose such requirements on employing offices. However, \n     as various commenters suggest, the Board will provide \n     guidance to employing offices concerning model recordkeeping \n     practices as part of carrying out its program of education \n     under section 301(h)of the CAA (2 U.S.C. 1381(h)).\n       The Board would also note that based upon their collective \n     years of experience representing employers and employees \n     with regard to various labor and employment laws, \n     including the FLSA, the absence of recordkeeping and \n     notice posting requirements may create a void which can \n     only partially be filled by the program of education to be \n     carried out by the Board pursuant to Section \n\n[[Page S 17618]]\n     301(h)(1) and the optional notice which will be distributed by the \n     Board pursuant to Section 301(h)(2). The Board also would \n     emphasize that employees will in many circumstances be \n     able to establish a prima facie case simply by their own \n     testimony estimating the hours worked by the employees \n     where the employing office has failed to maintain \n     adequate, accurate records. An employing office may find \n     that its ability to respond to an employee's prima facie \n     case is substantially burdened by its failure to keep \n     accurate payroll and time-records. If Congress wishes to \n     experience the same burdens as faced by the private sector \n     and also to address these issues, it should enact \n     recordkeeping requirements comparable to those of the \n     FLSA. (Of course, like the regulations under those \n     statutes, such recordkeeping requirements may leave to the \n     discretion of each employing office the precise form and \n     manner in which records will be kept.) But, in light of \n     the text and structure of the CAA, the Board believes that \n     it is up to Congress to decide whether to do so.\n\n                      II. The proposed regulations\n\n                              A. Background\n\n        Congress committed enforcement of the Fair Labor Standards \n     Act of 1938 to the Department of Labor and its Wage and Hour \n     Division, whose regulations and interpretations of that Act \n     comprise almost one thousand pages of Chapter V, Title 29 of \n     the Code of Federal Regulations. In enacting the CAA, \n     however, Congress expressly refused to commit enforcement to \n     the executive branch of the Federal government nor did \n     Congress bring its employing offices under the FLSA itself. \n     Instead, Congress carefully specified, through sectional \n     references to the FLSA, the substantive rights and \n     protections afforded to legislative employees, and precisely \n     mandated procedures by which those rights and protections \n     would be largely enforced by a new and independent office in \n     the legislative branch, the Office of Compliance. Further, in \n     granting the Board rulemaking authority with respect to the \n     FLSA in Section 203(c)(1) of the CAA, Congress affirmatively \n     commanded the Board to issue substantive regulations, with \n     the important directive that they ``shall be the same as \n     substantive regulations promulgated by the Secretary of Labor \n     * * * except as the Board may determine, for good cause shown \n     * * * that a modification of such regulations would be more \n     effective for the implementation of rights and protections \n     under'' the CAA.\n        In the Board's view, and notwithstanding what has been \n     urged by some of the commenters, this unusual statutory \n     framework neither mandates nor allows an uncritical, \n     wholesale incorporation of all the regulations and \n     interpretive statements issued by the Labor Department under \n     the FLSA. Rather, this statutory framework requires the Board \n     to cull from the vast body of FLSA material found in the Code \n     of Regulations only those items that constitute ``substantive \n     regulations'' as the term is understood under settled \n     principles of administrative law. (See Batterton v. Francis, \n     422 U.S. 416, 425, n. 9 (1977)). Moreover, the statutory \n     framework authorizes the Board to delete those substantive \n     regulations that either have no application in the employing \n     offices of the Congress or that are not likely to be invoked. \n     For these reasons, the Board is not proposing their adoption, \n     unless public comments establish a justification to the \n     contrary. Finally, by limiting itself to substantive \n     regulations, the Board is not adopting those portions of 29 \n     C.F.R. chapter V that constitute the interpretative bulletins \n     or statements of the Department of Labor and its Wage and \n     Hour Division.\n\n                        B. Proposed regulations\n\n      1. General provisions\n        The proposed regulations include an initial Part 501 which \n     contains matters of general applicability including the \n     purpose and scope of the regulations, definitions, coverage, \n     and the administrative authority of the Board and the Office \n     of Compliance. In addition, a section explains the effect of \n     interpretative bulletins and statements of the Department of \n     Labor, and another section provides for the application of \n     the Portal to Portal Act. These latter sections are discussed \n     below.\n        It is noted that the definition section incorporates the \n     general provisions of section 101 of the CAA which defines \n     ``employee,'' ``covered employee,'' ``employing office,'' and \n     ``employee of the House of Representatives.'' Section 203 of \n     the CAA, which applies the rights and protections of the \n     FLSA, also contemplates the promulgation of a definitional \n     regulation that excludes ``interns'' from the meaning of \n     ``covered employee.'' The Board, in a separate NPRM issued on \n     October 11, 1995, proposed such a regulation, together with a \n     regulation governing irregular work schedules and the receipt \n     of compensatory time in lieu of overtime compensation. The \n     Board is reviewing the public comments received in response \n     to that NPRM and will issue a separate final rule on those \n     issues.\n        It should be noted that section 225(f)(1) of the CAA \n     provides that, except where inconsistent with definitions of \n     the CAA itself, the definitions in the laws made applicable \n     by the CAA shall also apply under the CAA. Thus, attention \n     must be paid to those definitions found in the FLSA that \n     are consistent with the CAA even if they are not expressly \n     incorporated in the proposed regulations. In this regard, \n     one commenter expressed concern over whether employing \n     offices would be obligated to pay minimum wages and \n     overtime compensation to individuals who do volunteer \n     work, in light of the fact that under the FLSA \n     ``employee'' may include certain volunteers. See 29 U.S.C. \n     Sec. 203(e)(4)(A), which excludes from the definition of \n     ``employee'' only certain volunteers who perform work for \n     a State, political subdivision, or interstate governmental \n     agency. Similarly, it is noted that, in enacting the CAA, \n     Congress did make separate provision for excluding \n     interns. Thus, the Board has concluded that, to the extent \n     that volunteer activity would bring an individual under \n     the coverage of the FLSA, similarly situated individuals \n     would be treated in the same manner under the CAA.\n     2. Provisions derived from regulations of the Department of \n         Labor\n       Those regulations of the Department of Labor that are being \n     adopted in substance include:\n       Part 531, which governs the manner in which an employee's \n     wages are calculated taking into account the reasonable cost \n     to an employer of furnishing board, lodging, or other \n     facilities. This Part is derived from Section 3(m) of the \n     FLSA, which directs how the ``wage'' paid to an employee is \n     determined. Section 3(m) must be treated as applicable under \n     the CAA by virtue of Section 225(f)(1), which authorizes \n     generally the inclusion of those definitions and exemptions \n     that are consistent with definitions and exemptions of the \n     CAA. However, it is noted that section 3(m) is inconsistent \n     with the CAA insofar as the implementing regulations in Part \n     531, Title 29, C.F.R., provide procedures by which the Wage \n     and Hour Administrator makes determinations in specific cases \n     with respect to the furnishing of board, lodging, or other \n     facilities. Because the Administrator has no role in the \n     enforcement of the CAA by reason of Section 225(f)(3), and \n     because the Board is not at this time is not authorizing the \n     Office of Compliance to make such specific determinations, \n     the Board proposes to delete the provisions setting forth \n     those procedures. Similarly, the reference to ``tipped \n     employees'' and the method by which their wages are \n     determined are deleted because the applicable sections assign \n     responsibility to the Administrator.\n       Part 541, which defines and delimits the bona fide \n     executive, administrative, and professional employees who are \n     exempt under Section 13(a) of the FLSA from the minimum wage \n     and maximum hours requirements. The Board has determined that \n     this exemption, commonly known as the ``white collar'' \n     exemption, is applicable to employing offices of Congress by \n     virtue of Section 225(f)(1) of the CAA.\n       In the ANPRM, the Board solicited public comment on whether \n     and to what extent it should modify the Labor Department's \n     regulations regarding this exemption. Generally, the \n     commenters did not question the applicability of this \n     exemption to covered employees under the CAA, and several \n     commenters urged the adoption of all of the Department's \n     regulations in Part 541, 29 C.F.R., including the \n     interpretative bulletins, without any modification. Two \n     commenters contended that the Board's regulations should \n     grant a sweeping exemption for nearly all staff employees \n     working in elected members' offices because they exercise \n     independent judgment and discretion in performing their \n     responsibilities.\n       Other commenters urged the Board to modify the Labor \n     Department regulations to take into account the unique job \n     responsibilities of staff working for an elected member \n     either in a personal office, in a leadership office or on \n     committee. Recognizing that job titles alone cannot be \n     dispositive of who is an exempt employee, these commenters \n     urged the Board to identify with particularity those job \n     duties which, if performed by an employee, would render him \n     or her an exempt executive, administrative, or professional \n     employee.\n       The Board is proposing to adopt the Labor Department's \n     substantive regulations contained in Subpart A of Part 541 of \n     29 C.F.R. that set forth the fundamental criteria for \n     satisfying each of the three exemptions. But, for the reasons \n     explained below, the Board is not formally adopting the \n     interpretative bulletins contained in Subpart B of Part 541 \n     of 29 C.F.R., which discuss and illustrate through examples \n     the Department's understanding of the exemption criteria.\n       With respect to some commenters' request that the Board \n     modify the white collar exemptions, upon reflection, the \n     Board has reluctantly concluded that such a modification \n     would not satisfy the ``good cause'' requirement of Section \n     203(c)(2) of the CAA. The Board recognizes that the \n     Secretary's regulations and interpretations were promulgated \n     in a different era, with different employment paradigms in \n     mind. Thus, the Board appreciates the many difficulties that \n     employing offices will have in interpreting and reconciling \n     these regulations to present day realities. Moreover, the \n     Board is mindful of the significant impact the application of \n     the administrative, executive and professional exemption will \n     have on the structuring, functioning and expense of the \n     Members' and Senators' personal offices and committee \n     offices. However, the Board notes that private sector and \n     state and local government employers face the same \n     difficulties. And the Board has not found any sound, \n     principled basis for modifying the exemption \n\n[[Page S 17619]]\n     regulation for Congress and its instrumentalities. That resolved, the \n     Board nonetheless wishes to make clear its intent to \n     provide, as time and resources permit, appropriate general \n     guidance to the Congress and its instrumentalities on how \n     to identify and justify which employees are exempt. Such \n     efforts made through the Office's education and \n     information programs, will attempt to assist employing \n     offices in determining which job duties will be considered \n     exempt under the executive, administration or professional \n     criteria.\n       Part 547, which defines, pursuant to Section 7(e)(3)(b) the \n     standard that bona fide thrift or savings plans must meet in \n     order not to be included within an employee's regular rate of \n     pay for purposes of calculating overtime obligations under \n     Section 7 of the FLSA. This is included in light of Section \n     203(a)1) of the CAA, which specifically applied the rights \n     and protections of Section 7 of the FLSA.\n       Part 570, which sets forth the limitations on the use of \n     child labor. This Part implements Section 12(c) of the FLSA, \n     prohibiting oppressive child labor, as defined by Section \n     3(l) of the same Act. The former section is specifically \n     referenced in Section 203(a)(1) of the CAA, while the latter \n     must be referenced by reason of Section 225(f)(1) of the CAA. \n     The inclusion of this Part in the separate regulations of the \n     Senate is necessitated by the fact that the Senate allows for \n     the appointment of congressional pages below the age of 16, \n     unlike the House of Representatives, which by law sets a \n     minimum age of 16 for such employees. For children under age \n     16, the FLSA regulations impose limitations on hours worked \n     during the school year. Part 570 is also included in the \n     separate regulations applicable to all other covered \n     employees and employing offices. Given the hazardous nature \n     of some of the activities of the support functions, such as \n     maintenance and repair, Part 570 regulations are being \n     proposed in the event that such instrumentalities employ \n     children under 18 years of age. It is noted that the Board \n     has not adopted regulations comparable to those set forth in \n     the Labor Department's Subpart B (29 C.F.R. Sections 570.5-\n     .27), authorizing the issuance of certificates of age. In \n     addition, with respect to Section 570.52, governing the \n     hazardous occupation of motor-vehicle driver and outside \n     helper, the Board is not adopting the special exemption for \n     school bus driving because by its terms no employing offices \n     would satisfy the criteria of the regulation.\n\n  C. Secretary of Labor's regulations that the Board proposes not to \n                                 adopt\n\n       In reviewing the remaining parts of the Labor Department's \n     regulations, it is readily apparent that some have no \n     application to the employing offices within the legislative \n     branch. For this reason, the Board is not including them \n     within its substantive regulations. Among the excluded \n     regulations are: Part 510, which pertains to the application \n     of the minimum wage provisions to Puerto Rico; Part 511, \n     establishing a wage order procedure for American Samoa; Part \n     515, authorizing the utilization of State government agencies \n     for investigations and inspections; Part 530, governing the \n     employment of industrial homeworkers in certain industries; \n     Part 549, defining the requirements of a ``bona fide profit-\n     sharing plan or trust;'' Part 550, defining the term ``talent \n     fees;'' Part 552, regulating the application of the FLSA to \n     domestic service; Part 575, addressing child labor in certain \n     agricultural employment; Parts 578, 579, and 580, \n     implementing the civil money penalties provisions of the \n     FLSA; and Part 679, dealing with industries in American \n     Samoa. Unless public comments suggest otherwise, the Board \n     intends including in the adopted regulations a provision \n     stating that the Board has issued regulations on all matters \n     for which the CAA requires a regulation. See Section 411 of \n     the CAA.\n       Other substantive regulations could have application in the \n     event that an employing office wished to avail itself of \n     certain special wage rates, subminimum wage exemptions or \n     overtime exemptions under the FLSA. These are found in: Parts \n     519-528, which authorize subminimum wages for full-time \n     students, student-learners, apprentices, learners, \n     messengers, workers with disabilities, and student workers; \n     Part 548, which authorizes in the collective bargaining \n     context the establishment of basic wage rates for overtime \n     compensation purposes; and Part 551, which implements an \n     overtime exemption for local delivery drivers and helpers. \n     Unless public comments provide a sufficient justification to \n     the contrary the Board is not proposing the adoption of \n     regulations covering the foregoing subjects.\n\n      III. The Interpretive Bulletins and other relevant guidance\n\n       In addition to the substantive regulations found in \n     Subchapter A, the Department of Labor has issued, under \n     Subchapter B, ``Statements of General Policy or \n     Interpretations Not Directly Related to Regulations.'' 29 \n     C.F.R Parts 775-794. Usually called Interpretive Bulletins, \n     these statements make available in one place the official \n     interpretations which guide the Secretary of Labor and the \n     Wage and Hour Administrator in the performance of their \n     duties. As the interpretations of an administering agency, \n     such statements are usually given some deference by the \n     courts. As the Supreme Court has observed:\n        ``the rulings, interpretations and opinions of the \n     Administrator under this Act, while not controlling upon the \n     courts by reason of their authority, do constitute a body of \n     experience and informed judgment to which courts and \n     litigants may properly resort for guidance. The weight of \n     such a judgment in a particular case will depend upon the \n     thoroughness evident in the consideration, the validity of \n     its reasoning its consistency with earlier and later \n     pronouncements, and all those factors which give it power to \n     persuade, if lacking power to control.'' Skidmore v. Swift, \n     323 U.S. 134, 140 (1944).\n       However, unlike ``substantive regulations,'' these \n     interpretations are not issued by the agency pursuant to its \n     statutory authority to implement the statute and, more \n     significantly, do not have the force and effect of law. See \n     Batterton v. Francis, 432 U.S. 416, 425 n.9 (1977). The \n     Board's mandate is only to issue substantive regulations that \n     are ``the same as the substantive regulations of the \n     Secretary of Labor to implement the statutory provision [of \n     the FLSA] applied'' by Section 204(a) of the CAA unless \n     modified for good cause (CAA Section 203 (c)(2)). Therefore, \n     the Board, does not propose to adopt the non-substantive \n     interpretations of the DOL and its Wage and Hour Division as \n     substantive regulations under the CAA. Moreover, the Board is \n     not proposing to issue the Department's interpretations as \n     its own interpretations of the FLSA rights and protections \n     made applicable under the CAA at this time. However, as \n     discussed below, employing offices should be advised that, \n     pursuant to the Portal to Portal Act, the Board will give due \n     consideration the Secretary's interpretations of the FLSA.\n       Application of the Portal to Portal Act.--The Portal to \n     Portal Act, 61 Stat. 84 (1947), codified generally at 29 \n     U.S.C. Sections 216 and 251, et seq. (``PPA''), contains \n     provisions which affect the rights and liabilities of \n     employees and employers with regard to alleged underpayment \n     of minimum or overtime wages under the FLSA. Section 4 of the \n     PPA excludes from the definition of hours worked both \n     activities preliminary to or postliminary to the worker's \n     principal activities and travel time absent a contract, \n     custom or practice to the contrary. 29 U.S.C. Section 254. \n     Sections 9 and 10 of the PPA provide the employer with a \n     defense against liability or punishment in any action or \n     proceeding brought against it for failure to comply with the \n     minimum wage and overtime provisions of the FLSA, where the \n     employer pleads and proves that the act or omission \n     complained of was in good faith in conformity with and in \n     reliance on any regulation, order, ruling, approval, \n     interpretation, administrative practice or enforcement policy \n     of the Wage and Hour Administrator of the Department of \n     Labor. 29 U.S.C. Sections 258-259. The PPA also contains \n     provisions which restrict and limit employee suits under \n     section 16(b) of the FLSA. For example, section 11 of the PPA \n     provides that in any action brought under section 216 of the \n     FLSA, the court may in its discretion, subject to prescribed \n     conditions, award no liquidated damages or award any amount \n     of such damages not to exceed the amount specified in section \n     16(b) of the FLSA. 29 U.S.C. Section 260.\n       The Board has determined that the above provisions of the \n     PPA are incorporated into section 203 of the CAA, either as \n     an amendment to section 16(b) of the FLSA (which is expressly \n     applied to the legislative branch under section 203(b) of the \n     CAA), or by virtue of section 225(f) of the CAA, which \n     applies the definitions and exemptions of the FLSA to the \n     extent not inconsistent with the CAA. To that end, the Board \n     will give due consideration to the interpretations of the \n     FLSA of the Secretary of Labor. Moreover, employing offices \n     may utilize these interpretations in attempting to understand \n     the rights and protections under the FLSA that have been made \n     applicable by the CAA. Unless and until the Secretary's \n     interpretive statements are superseded or interpretative \n     guidance or decisions to the contrary are issued by the Board \n     or the courts, they may be relied upon for purposes of \n     defending against claims brought under the CAA to the same \n     extent as private sector employers may properly rely upon \n     them in actions brought under the FLSA.\n       Joint employer doctrine.--The Board solicited comments in \n     the ANPRM on whether and to what extent the joint employment \n     doctrine as developed under the FLSA is applicable under the \n     CAA. The comments generally advocated adoption of the \n     doctrine to employing offices of the Congress. However, since \n     the issue of joint employment is addressed through a DOL \n     interpretive bulletin set forth in Part 791, 29 C.F.R., \n     rather than a substantive regulation, the Board is not \n     adopting it as such nor issuing it as its own interpretive \n     statement. See discussion at Section III.\n       Equal Pay Act.--With respect to the Equal Pay Act (EPA), \n     which is included in Section 6(d) of the FLSA, 29 U.S.C. \n     Section 206(d), the Secretary of Labor promulgated \n     interpretative regulations that were originally included in \n     29 C.F.R. Part 800. Pursuant to the provisions of \n     Reorganization Plan No. 1 of 1978, as confirmed by the \n     Congress in Public Law 98-532, 98 Stat. 2705 (1984), \n     enforcement and administration of the EPA was transferred \n     from the Secretary of Labor to the Equal Employment \n     Opportunity Commission (EEOC). The EEOC promulgated its \n     own interpretations implementing the EPA at 29 C.F.R. Part \n     1620. Thereafter, the Secretary deleted its \n     interpretations. 52 FR 2517 (Jan. \n\n[[Page S 17620]]\n     23, 1987). Thus, there are no substantive regulations implementing the \n     EPA. Under the rationale previously stated regarding the \n     Portal to Portal Act, the Board declines to incorporate \n     the EEOC interpretations as substantive regulations under \n     the CAA but will recognize them as is appropriate.\n       Opinion Letters.--Commenters asked that the Board consider \n     establishing a process under which the Office or the Board \n     would issue opinion letters and upon which employing offices \n     could rely, similar to the procedure followed by the Wage and \n     Hour Administrator in sometimes providing such opinions at \n     the request of private sector employers. The Board \n     understands employing offices' desire for guidance and \n     clarity regarding their obligations under the CAA.\n       To the extent that the Board itself can address issues \n     through regulations or interpretations, it will do so. \n     Moreover, the Office intends to provide appropriate education \n     and technical assistance as part of its education and \n     information responsibilities. But for the reasons stated \n     here, the Board and the Office's ability to do so is limited \n     by legal, resource and policy considerations. As is the case \n     in the private sector context, many issues under these \n     statutes can only be definitively resolved through case-by-\n     case adjudication on particular facts. Moreover, except in \n     the context of statutes subject to the Portal to Portal Act, \n     it is doubtful that the Board or the Office has the statutory \n     authority to issue guidance with legal effect (outside of the \n     adjudicatory or rulemaking contexts); we are not aware of any \n     such legal authorization for Executive Branch agencies to do \n     so in the context of applying these same laws to the private \n     sector. Further, the resources of the Board and the Office \n     are limited: the first year appropriation is for $2.5 \n     million. These resources are substantially less than those \n     available to analogous Executive Branch agencies that \n     administer fewer laws. Finally, public comment has not \n     provided the Board with the facts necessary for yet making \n     any of these determinations--and a detailed evidentiary \n     record is necessary for such judgment to be made. In short, \n     particularly in light of the various statutory \n     responsibilities of the Office and the Board, it is not \n     possible to give answers with legal effect to each individual \n     request for information and guidance. While the Board will \n     structure education and information programs to assist \n     employees and employing offices, it is forced to respond \n     that, like private employers, employing offices will \n     generally have to rely on their own counsel and human \n     resource advisors in determining their compliance with the \n     Congressional Accountability Act.\n\n                         IV. Method of approval\n\n       The Board recommends that (1) the version of the proposed \n     regulations that shall apply to the Senate and employees of \n     the Senate be approved by the Senate by resolution; (2) the \n     version of the proposed regulations that shall apply to the \n     House of Representatives and employees of the House of \n     Representatives be approved by the House of Representatives \n     by resolution; and (3) the version of the proposed \n     regulations that shall apply to other covered employees and \n     employing offices be approved by the Congress by concurrent \n     resolution.\n       Signed at Washington, D.C., on this 21st day of November, \n     1995.\n                                                    Glen D.

C501.101 Purpose and scope.\n\n       (a) Section 203 of the Congressional Accountability Act \n     (CAA) provides that the rights and protections of subsections \n     (a)(1) and (d) of section 6, section 7, and section 12(c) of \n     the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 (FLSA) (29 U.S.C. \n     Sec. Sec. 206(a)(1) & (d), 207.212(c)) shall apply to covered \n     employees of the legislative branch of the Federal \n     government. Section 301 of the CAA creates the Office of \n     Compliance as an independent office in the legislative branch \n     for enforcing the rights and protections of the FLSE, as \n     applied by the CAA.\n       (b) The FLSA as applied by the CAA provides for minimum \n     standards for both wages and overtime entitlements, and \n     delineates administrative procedures by which covered \n     worktime must be compensated. Included also in the FLSA are \n     provisions related to child labor, equal pay, and portal-to-\n     portal activities. In addition, the FLSA exempts specified \n     employees or groups of employees from the application of \n     certain of its provisions.\n       (c) This chapter contains the substantive regulations with \n     respect to the FLSA that the Board of Directors of the Office \n     of Compliance has adopted pursuant to Sections 203(c) and 304 \n     of the CAA, which requires that the Board promulgate \n     regulations that are ``the same as substantive regulations \n     promulgated by the Secretary of Labor to implement the \n     statutory provisions referred to in subsection (a) [of \n     Sec. 203 of the CAA] except insofar as the Board may \n     determine, for good cause shown . . . that a modification of \n     such regulations would be more effective for the \n     implementation of the rights and protections under this \n     section.''\n\n     Sec. C501.102 Definitions.\n\n       For purposes of this chapter.\n       (c) CAA means the Congressional Accountability Act of 1995 \n     (P.L. 104-1, 109 Stat. 3, 2 U.S.C. Sec. Sec. 1301-1438).\n       (b) FLSA or Act means the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938, \n     as amended (29 U.S.C. Sec. 201 et seq.).\n       (c) Covered employee means any employee, including an \n     applicant for employment and a former employee, of the (1) \n     the Capitol Guide Service; (2) the Capitol Police; (3) the \n     Congressional Budget Office; (4) the Office of the Architect \n     of the Capitol; (5) the Office of the Attending Physician; \n     (6) the Office of Compliance; or (7) the Office of Technology \n     Assessment.\n       (d) (1) Employee of the Office of the Architect of the \n     Capitol includes any employee of the Architect of the \n     Capitol, the Botanic Garden, or the Senate Restaurants;(2) \n     Employee of the Capitol Police includes any member or officer \n     of the Capitol Police.\n       (e) Employing office and employer mean (1) the Capitol \n     Guide Service; (2) the Capitol Police; (3) the Congressional \n     Budget Office; (4) the Office of the Architect of the \n     Capitol; (5) the Office of the Attending Physician; (6) the \n     Office of Compliance; or (7) the Office of Technology \n     Assessment.\n       (f) Board means the Board of Directors of the Office of \n     Compliance.\n       (g) Office means the Office of Compliance.\n\n     Sec. C501.103 Coverage.\n\n       The coverage of Section 203 of the CAA extends to any \n     covered employee of an employing office without regard to \n     whether the covered employee is engaged in commerce or the \n     production of goods for interstate commerce and without \n     regard to size, number of employees, amount of business \n     transacted, or other measure.\n\n     Sec. C501.104 Administrative authority.\n\n       (a) The Office of Compliance is authorized to administer \n     the provisions of Section 203 of the Act with respect to any \n     covered employee or covered employer.\n       (b) The Board is authorized to promulgate substantive \n     regulations in accordance with the provisions of Sections \n     203(c) and 304 of the CAA.\n       (c) The Board may in its discretion from time to time issue \n     interpretative statements providing guidance to employees and \n     to employing offices on the rights and protections \n     established under the FLSA that are made applicable by \n     Sections 203(a) and 225 of the CAA.\n\n     Sec. C501.105 Effect of interpretations of the Department of \n       Labor.\n\n       (a) In administering the FLSA, the Wage and Hour Division \n     of the Department of Labor has issued not only substantive \n     regulations but also interpretative bulletins. Substantive \n     regulations represent an exercise of statutorily-delegated \n     lawmaking authority from the legislative branch to an \n     administrative agency. Generally, they are proposed in \n     accordance with the notice-and-comment procedures of the \n     Administrative Procedure Act (APA), 5 U.S.C. Sec. 553. Once \n     promulgated, such regulations are considered to have the \n     force and effect of law, unless set aside upon judicial \n     review as arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or \n     otherwise not in accordance with law. See Batterton v. \n     Francis, 432 U.S. 416, 425 n.9 (1977). See also 29 C.F.R. \n     Sec. 790.17(b) (1994). Unlike substantive regulations, \n     interpretative statements, including bulletins and other \n     releases of the Wage and Hour Division, are not issued \n     pursuant to the provisions of the APA and may not have the \n     force and effect of law. Rather, they may only constitute \n     official interpretations of the Department of Labor with \n     respect to the meaning and application of the minimum wage, \n     maximum hour, and overtime pay requirements of the \n\n[[Page S 17621]]\n     FLSA. See 29 C.F.R. Sec. 790.17(c) (citing Final Report of the Attorney \n     General's Committee on Administrative Procedure, Senate \n     Document No.8, 77th Cong., 1st Sess., at p. 27 (1941)). The \n     purpose of such statements is to make available in one place \n     the interpretations of the FLSA which will guide the \n     Secretary of Labor and the Wage and Hour Administrator in the \n     performance of their duties unless and until they are \n     otherwise directed by authoritative decisions of the courts \n     or conclude, upon reexamination of an interpretation, that it \n     is incorrect. The Supreme Court has observed: ``[T]he \n     rulings, interpretations and opinions of the Administrator \n     under this Act, while not controlling upon the courts by \n     reason of their authority, do constitute a body of experience \n     and informed judgment to which courts and litigants may \n     properly resort for guidance. The weight of such a judgment \n     in a particular case will depend upon the thoroughness \n     evident in the consideration, the validity of its reasoning, \n     its consistency with earlier and later pronouncements, and \n     all those factors which give it power to persuade, if lacking \n     power to control.'' Skidmore v. Swift, 323 U.S. 134, 140 \n     (1944).\n       (b) Section 203(c) of the CAA provides that the substantive \n     regulations implementing Section 203 of the CAA shall be \n     ``the same as substantive regulations promulgated by the \n     Secretary of Labor'' except where the Board finds, for good \n     cause shown, that a modification would more effectively \n     implement the rights and protections established by the FLSA. \n     Thus, the CAA by its terms does not mandate that the Board \n     adopt the interpretative statements of the Department of \n     Labor or its Wage and Hour Division. The Board is thus not \n     adopting such statements as part of its substantive \n     regulations.\n\n     Sec. C501.106 Application of the Portal-to-Portal Act of \n       1947.\n\n       (a) Consistent with Section 225 of the CAA, the Portal to \n     Portal Act (PPA), 29 U.S.C. Sec. Sec. 216 and 251 et seq., is \n     applicable in defining and delimiting the rights and \n     protections of the FLSA that are prescribed by the CAA. \n     Section 10 of the PPA, 29 U.S.C. Sec. 259, provides in \n     pertinent part:\n       [N]o employer shall be subject to any liability or \n     punishment for or on account of the failure of the employer \n     to pay minimum wages or overtime compensation under the Fair \n     Labor Standards Act of 1938, as amended, . . . if he pleads \n     and proves that the act or omission complained of was in good \n     faith in conformity with and reliance on any written \n     administrative regulation, order, ruling, approval or \n     interpretation of [the Administrator of the Wage and Hour \n     Division of the Department of Labor] . . . or any \n     administrative practice or enforcement policy of such agency \n     with respect to the class of employers to which he belonged. \n     Such a defense, if established shall be a bar to the action \n     or proceeding, notwithstanding that after such act or \n     omission, such administrative regulation, order, ruling, \n     approval, interpretation, practice or enforcement policy is \n     modified or rescinded or is determined by judicial authority \n     to be invalid or of no legal effect.\n       (b) In defending any action or proceeding based on any act \n     or omission arising out of section 203 of the CAA, an \n     employing office may satisfy the standards set forth in \n     subsection (a) by pleading and proving good faith reliance \n     upon:\n       (1) Any written administrative regulation, order, decision, \n     ruling, approval or interpretation, or any administrative \n     practice or enforcement policy, of the Board.\n       (2) Any written administrative regulation, order, ruling, \n     approval or interpretation, of the Administrator of the Wage \n     and Hour Division of the Department of Labor: Provided, that \n     such regulation, order, ruling approval or interpretation had \n     not been superseded at the time of reliance by any \n     regulation, order, decision, ruling, approval or \n     interpretation, or any administrative practice or enforcement \n     policy, of the Board or the courts.\n\n\n  part h531--wage payments under the fair labor standards act of 1938\n\n                     subpart a--preliminary matters\n\nSec.\nC531.00  Corresponding section table of the FLSA regulations of the \n              Labor Department and the CAA regulations of the Office of \n              Compliance.\nC531.1  Definitions.\nC531.2  Purpose and scope.\n\n\n  subpart b--determinations of ``reasonable cost and ``fair value''; \n              effects of collective bargaining agreements\n\n       C531.3  General determinations of 'reasonable cost'.\n       C531.6  Effects of collective bargaining agreements.\n\n\n                    subpart a--preliminary matters.\n\n     Sec.

C531.1 Definitions.\n\n       (a) Administrator means the Administrator of the Wage and \n     Hour Division or his authorized representative. The Secretary \n     of Labor has delegated to the Administrator the functions \n     vested in him under section 3(m) of the Act.\n       (b) Act means the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938, as \n     amended.\n\n     Sec. C531.2 Purpose and scope.\n\n       (a) Section 3(m) of the Act defines the term 'wage' to \n     include the 'reasonable cost', as determined by the Secretary \n     of Labor, to an employer of furnishing any employee with \n     board, lodging, or other facilities, if such board, lodging, \n     or other facilities are customarily furnished by the employer \n     to his employees. In addition, section 3(m) gives the \n     Secretary authority to determine the 'fair value.' of such \n     facilities on the basis of average cost to the employer or to \n     groups of employers similarly situated, on average value to \n     groups of employees, or other appropriate measures of 'fair \n     value.' Whenever so determined and when applicable and \n     pertinent, the 'fair value' of the facilities involved shall \n     be includable as part of 'wages' instead of the actual \n     measure of the costs of those facilities. The section \n     provides, however, that the cost of board, lodging, or other \n     facilities shall not be included as part of 'wages' if \n     excluded therefrom by a bona fide collective bargaining \n     agreement. Section 3(m) also provides a method for \n     determining the wage of a tipped employee.\n       (b) This part 531 contains any determinations made as to \n     the 'reasonable cost' and 'fair value' of board, lodging, or \n     other facilities having general application.\n\n\n subpart b--determinations of ``reasonable cost'' and ``fair value''; \n              effects of collective bargaining agreements\n\n     Sec. C531.3 General determinations of 'reasonable cost.'\n\n       (a) The term reasonable cost as used in section 3(m) of the \n     Act is hereby determined to be not more than the actual cost \n     to the employer of the board, lodging, or other facilities \n     customarily furnished by him to his employees.\n       (b) Reasonable cost does not include a profit to the \n     employer or to any affiliated person.\n       (c) The reasonable cost to the employer of furnishing the \n     employee with board, lodging, or other facilities (including \n     housing) is the cost of operation and maintenance including \n     adequate depreciation plus a reasonable allowance (not more \n     than 5 1/2 percent) for interest on the depreciated amount of \n     capital invested by the employer: Provided, That if the total \n     so computed is more than the fair rental value (or the fair \n     price of the commodities or facilities offered for sale), the \n     fair rental value (or the fair price of the commodities or \n     facilities offered for sale) shall be the reasonable cost. \n     The cost of operation and maintenance, the rate of \n     depreciation, and the depreciated amount of capital invested \n     by the employer shall be those arrived at under good \n     accounting practices. As used in this paragraph, the term \n     good accounting practices does not include accounting \n     practices which have been rejected by the Internal Revenue \n     Service for tax purposes, and the term depreciation includes \n     obsolescence.\n       (d)(1) The cost of furnishing 'facilities' found by the \n     Administrator to be primarily for the benefit or convenience \n     of the employer will not be recognized as reasonable and may \n     not therefore be included in computing wages.\n       (2) The following is a list of facilities found by the \n     Administrator to be primarily for the benefit of convenience \n     of the employer. The list is intended to be illustrative \n     rather than exclusive: (i) Tools of the trade and other \n     materials and services incidental to carrying on the \n     employer's business; (ii) the cost of any construction by and \n     for the employer; (iii) the cost of uniforms and of their \n     laundering, where the nature of the business requires the \n     employee to wear a uniform.\n\n     Sec. C531.6 Effects of collective bargaining agreements.\n\n       (a) The cost of board, lodging, or other facilities shall \n     not be included as part of the wage paid to any employee to \n     the extent it is excluded therefrom under the terms of a bona \n     fide collective bargaining agreement applicable to the \n     particular employee.\n       (b) A collective bargaining agreement shall be deemed to be \n     `bona fide' when pursuant to the provisions of section \n     7(b)(1) or 7(b)(2) of the FLSA it is made with the certified \n     representative of the employees under the provisions of the \n     CAA.\n\n[[Page S 17622]]\n\n\n\n part c541--defining and delimiting the terms ``bona fide executive,'' \n    ``administrative,'' or ``professional'' capacity (including any \nemployee employed in the capacity of academic administrative personnel \n                    or teacher in secondary school)\n\n                     subpart a--general regulations\n\n       Sec.\n       C541.00  Corresponding section table of the FLSA \n           regulations of the Labor Department and the CAA \n           regulations of the Office of Compliance.\n       C541.01  Application of the exemptions of section 13(a)(1) \n           of the FLSA.\n       C541.1  Executive.\n       C541.2  Administrative.\n       C541.3  Professional.\n       C541.5b  Equal pay provisions of section 6(d) of the FLSA \n           as applied by the CAA extend to executive, \n           administrative, and professional employees.\n\n\n                     subpart a--general regulations\n\n     Sec.

C547.0 Scope and effect of part.\n\n       (a) The regulations in this part set forth the requirements \n     of a ``bona fide thrift or savings plan'' under section \n     7(e)(3)(b) of the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938, as \n     amended (FLSA), as applied by the CAA. In determining the \n     total remuneration for employment which section 7(e) of the \n     FLSA requires to be included in the regular rate at which an \n     employee is employed, it is not necessary to include any sums \n     paid to or on behalf of such employee, in recognition of \n     services performed by him during a given period, which are \n     paid pursuant to a bona fide thrift or savings plan meeting \n     the requirements set forth herein. In the formulation of \n     these regulations due regard has been given to the factors \n     and standards set forth in section 7(e)(3)(b) of the Act.\n       (b) Where a thrift or savings plan is combined in a single \n     program (whether in one or more documents) with a plan or \n     trust for providing old age, retirement, life, accident or \n     health insurance or similar benefits for employees, \n     contributions made by the employer pursuant to such thrift or \n     savings plan may be excluded from the regular rate if the \n     plan meets the requirements of the regulation in this part \n     and the contributions made for the other purposes may be \n     excluded from the regular rate if they meet the tests set \n     forth in regulations.\n\n     Sec. C547.1 Essential requirements for qualifications.\n\n       (a) A ``bona fide thrift or savings plan'' for the purpose \n     of section 7(e)(3)(b) of the FLSA as applied by the CAA is \n     required to meet all the standards set forth in paragraphs \n     (b) through (f) of this section and must not contain the \n     disqualifying provisions set forth in Sec.  547.2.\n       (b) The thrift or savings plan constitutes a definite \n     program or arrangement in writing, adopted by the employer or \n     by contract as a result of collective bargaining and \n     communicated or made available to the employees, which is \n     established and maintained, in good faith, for the purpose of \n     encouraging voluntary thrift or savings by employees by \n     providing an incentive to employees to accumulate regularly \n     and retain cash savings for a reasonable period of time or to \n     save through the regular purchase of public or private \n     securities.\n       (c) The plan specifically shall set forth the category or \n     categories of employees participating and the basis of their \n     eligibility. Eligibility may not be based on such factors as \n     hours of work, production, or efficiency of the employees: \n     Provided, however, That hours of work may be used to \n     determine eligibility of part-time or casual employees.\n       (d) The amount any employee may save under the plan shall \n     be specified in the plan or determined in accordance with a \n     definite formula specified in the plan, which formula may be \n     based on one or more factors such as the straight-time \n     earnings or total earnings, base rate of pay, or length of \n     service of the employee.\n       (e) The employer's total contribution in any year may not \n     exceed 15 percent of the participating employees' total \n     earnings during that year. In addition, the employer's total \n     contribution in any year may not exceed the total amount \n     saved or invested by the participating employees during that \n     year: Provided, however, That a plan permitting a greater \n     contribution may be submitted to the Administrator and \n     approved by him as a ``bona fide thrift or savings plan'' \n     within the meaning of section 7(e)(3)(b) of the Act if:\n       (1) The plan meets all the other standards of this section;\n       (2) The plan contains none of the disqualifying factors \n     enumerated in Sec. C547.2;\n       (3) The employer's contribution is based to a substantial \n     degree upon retention of savings; and\n       (4) The amount of the employer's contribution bears a \n     reasonable relationship to the amount of savings retained and \n     the period of retention.\n       (f) The employer's contributions shall be apportioned among \n     the individual employees in accordance with a definite \n     formula or method of calculation specified in the plan, which \n     formula or method of calculation is based on the amount saved \n     or the length of time the individual employee retains his \n     savings or investment in the plan: Provided, That no \n     employee's share determined in accordance with the plan may \n     be diminished because of any other remuneration received by \n     him.\n\n     Sec. C547.2 Disqualifying provisions.\n\n       (a) No employee's participation in the plan shall be on \n     other than a voluntary basis.\n       (b) No employee's wages or salary shall be dependent upon \n     or influenced by the existence of such thrift or savings plan \n     or the employer's contributions thereto.\n       (c) The amounts any employee may save under the plan, or \n     the amounts paid by the employer under the plan may not be \n     based upon the employee's hours of work, production or \n     efficiency.\n\n\n                   PART C570--CHILD LABOR REGULATIONS\n\n                           SUBPART A--GENERAL\n\nSec.\nC570.00  Corresponding section table of the FLSA regulations of the \n              Labor Department and the CAA regulations of the Office of \n              Compliance.\nC570.1  Definitions.\nC570.2  Minimum age standards.\n\n\n Subpart C--Employment of Minors Between 14 and 16 Years of Age (Child \n                             Labor Reg. 3)\n\nC570.31  Determination.\nC570.32  Effect of this subpart.\nC570.33  Occupations.\nC570.35  Periods and conditions of employment.\n\n\n  Subpart E--Occupations Particularly Hazardous for the Employment of \nMinors Between 16 and 18 Years of Age or Detrimental to Their Health or \n                               Well-Being\n\nC570.50  General.\nC570.51  Occupations in or about plants or establishments manufacturing \n              or storing explosives or articles containing explosive \n              components (Order 1).\nC570.52  Occupations of motor-vehicle driver and outside helper (Order \n              2).\nC570.55  Occupations involved in the operation of power-driven \n              woodworking machines (Order 5).\nC570.58  Occupations involved in the operation of power-driven hoisting \n              apparatus (Order 7).\nC570.59  Occupations involved in the operations of power-driven metal \n              forming, punching, and shearing machines (Order 8).\nC570.62  Occupations involved in the operation of bakery machines \n              (Order 11).\nC570.63  Occupations involved in the operation of paper-products \n              machines (Order 12).\nC570.65  Occupations involved in the operations of circular saws, band \n              saws, and guillotine shears (Order 14).\nC570.66  Occupations involved in wrecking and demolition operations \n              (Order 15).\nC570.67  Occupations in roofing operations (Order 16).\nC570.68  Occupations in excavation operations (Order 17).\n\n\n                           Subpart A--General\n\n     Sec.

These proposed regulations \n     implement sections 202 (a) and (b) of the Congressional \n     Accountability Act of 1995 (``CAA''), Public Law 104-1, 2 \n     U.S.C. Sec. Sec. 1312(a)-(b).\n       The CAA extends the rights and protections of eleven labor \n     and employment laws to covered employees within the \n     legislative branch. Section 202 governs the extension of the \n     rights and protections of the FMLA to covered employees and \n     employing offices of the House of Representatives, the \n     Senate, and seven Congressional instrumentalities listed in \n     paragraph (3) below. The purposes of the FMLA include \n     entitling employees to take reasonable leave for medical \n     reasons, for the birth or adoption of a child, and for the \n     care of a child, spouse, or parent who has a serious health \n     condition.\n       This notice proposes that substantially similar regulations \n     be adopted for the Senate, the House of Representatives, and \n     the seven Congressional instrumentalities; and their \n     employees. Accordingly:\n       (1) Senate. It is proposed that regulations as described in \n     this notice be included in the body of regulations that shall \n     apply to the Senate and employees of the Senate, and this \n     proposal regarding the Senate and its employees is \n     recommended by the Office of Compliance's Deputy Executive \n     Director for the Senate.\n       (2) House of Representatives. It is further proposed that \n     regulations as described in this notice be included in the \n     body of regulations that shall apply to the House of \n     Representatives and employees of the House of \n     Representatives, and this proposal regarding the House of \n     Representatives and its employees is recommended by the \n     Office of Compliance's Deputy Executive Director for the \n     House of Representatives.\n       (3) Certain Congressional instrumentalities. It is further \n     proposed that regulations as described in this notice be \n     included in the body of regulations that shall apply to the \n     Capitol Guide Board, the Capitol Police Board, the \n     Congressional Budget Office, the Office of the Architect of \n     the Capitol, the Office of the Attending Physician, the \n     Office of Compliance, and the Office of Technology \n     Assessment, and their employees; and this proposal regarding \n     these seven Congressional instrumentalities is recommended by \n     the Office of Compliance's Executive Director.\n       Dates: Comments are due on or before the date 30 days after \n     the date of publication of this notice in the Congressional \n     Record.\n       Addresses: Submit written comments (an original and 10 \n     copies) to the Chair of the Board of Directors, Office of \n     Compliance, Room LA 200, John Adams Building, 110 Second \n     Street, S.E., Washington, D.C. 20540-1999.

This notice is also \n     available in the following formats: large print, braille, \n     audio tape, and electronic file on computer disk. Requests \n     for this notice in an alternative format should be made to \n     Mr. Russell Jackson, Director, Service Department, Office of \n     the Sergeant at Arms and Doorkeeper of the Senate, at (202) \n     224-2507.\n       Supplementary information:\n\n                             A. Background.\n\n       Statutory background. The Congressional Accountability Act \n     of 1995 (``CAA''), 2 U.S.C. Sec. Sec. 1301 et seq., was \n     enacted into law on January 23, 1995. The CAA extends the \n     application of eleven federal labor and employment laws to \n     covered employees and employing offices within the \n     legislative branch.\n       Sections 202 (a) and (b) of the CAA apply rights and \n     protections of the Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993 \n     (``FMLA'') to covered employees and employing offices. The \n     FMLA generally requires employers to permit covered employees \n     to take up to 12 weeks of unpaid, job-protected leave during \n     a 12-month period for the birth of a child and to care for \n     the newborn; placement of a child for adoption or foster \n     care; care of a spouse, child, or parent with a serious \n     health condition; or an employee's own serious health \n     condition. The FMLA and the regulations of the Secretary of \n     Labor (``Secretary'') implementing the FMLA contain \n     provisions concerning the maintenance of health benefits \n     during leave, job restoration after leave, notice and medical \n     certifications of the need for FMLA leave, and the \n     relationship of FMLA leave to the rights under other \n     employment laws including the Americans With Disabilities \n     Act, workers compensation, and Title VII of the Civil Rights \n     Act of 1964.\n       Section 202(d) of the CAA directs the Board of Directors of \n     the Office of Compliance established under the CAA to issue \n     regulations to implement the rights and protections under \n     section 202. Section 202(d)(2) further states that the \n     regulations ``shall be the same as substantive regulations \n     promulgated by the Secretary of Labor to implement the \n     statutory provisions referred to in subsection (a) [of \n     section 202] except insofar as the Board may determine, for \n     good cause shown and stated together with the regulation, \n     that a modification of such regulations would be more \n     effective for the implementation of the rights and \n     protections under this section.''\n       Offices to which the proposed regulations apply. As noted \n     above in the Summary, the regulations proposed in this notice \n     are to be adopted in three separate bodies of regulations: \n     (1) one applying to the Senate and its employees, (2) one \n     applying to the House of Representatives and its employees, \n     and (3) one applying to the seven Congressional \n     instrumentalities listed above in the Summary, and their \n     employees.1 It is proposed that there will be only \n     minor, non-substantive variations among the three versions \n     of these regulations. These proposed variations are set \n     forth in the proposed regulatory language included in this \n     NPRM.\n     \\1\\ This notice does not apply to the General Accounting \n     Office (``GAO''), the Government Printing Office (``GPO''), \n     or the Library of Congress (the ``Library''). Section 201 of \n     the FMLA already applies to GAO, GPO, and the Library (5 \n     U.S.C. Sec. Sec. 6381 et seq.); section 230 of the CAA \n     requires a study of the application of the FMLA to these \n     three agencies; and section 202(c) of the CAA amends the FMLA \n     provisions applicable to the GAO and the Library, effective \n     one year after the study is transmitted to Congress.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n B. The Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, and Response to Comments\n\n       On September 28, 1995, the Board of Directors of the Office \n     of Compliance issued an Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking \n     (``ANPRM'') soliciting comments from interested parties in \n     order to obtain information and participation early in the \n     rulemaking process. 141 Cong. Rec. S 14542 (daily ed., Sept. \n     28, 1995). In addition to inviting comment on specific \n     questions arising under five of the statutes made applicable \n     by the CAA, the Board and the Executive Director, and the \n     Deputy Executive Directors of the Office of Compliance have \n     consulted with the Chair of the Administrative Conference of \n     the United States, the Secretary of Labor, and the Director \n     of the Office of Personnel Management with regard to the \n     development of these regulations in accordance with Section \n     304(g) of the CAA. Based on the information gleaned from \n     these comments on the ANPRM and this consultation, the Board \n     is publishing these proposed rules pursuant to section 202(d) \n     of the CAA, 2 U.S.C. Sec. 1312(d).\n       In response to the ANPRM, the Board received comments from \n     a variety of sources expressing a wide range of views. The \n     following discussion describes issues raised by the ANPRM and \n     by comments in response to the ANPRM, and explains how the \n     Board has taken these comments into account in developing \n     proposed regulations. The Board invites further comments on \n     the regulations proposed in this notice.\n       The first two issues--on whether the Board should modify \n     the Secretary of Labor's regulations, and on notice posting \n     and recordkeeping--are generic issues that arise under \n     several statutes made applicable by the CAA. The comments on \n     these issues and the Board's conclusions are fully discussed \n     in the Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM) regarding the \n     application of the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA). The NPRM \n     regarding the FLSA is being published today, in this issue of \n     the Congressional Record. Therefore, the comments and \n     analysis regarding these two issues are only briefly \n     summarized in this notice, and the reader is directed to the \n\n[[Page S 17628]]\n     NPRM regarding the FLSA for a fuller discussion.\n     1. Whether and to what extent the board should modify the \n         labor department's regulations\n       The first question posed in the ANPRM was the general \n     question of whether and to what extent the Board should \n     modify the Department of Labor's regulations with respect to \n     all of the statutes made applicable by the CAA.\n       Those commenters who expressed views on this issue cited \n     both the statute and the legislative history for the position \n     that the CAA presumes that the regulations of the Department \n     of Labor should generally not be modified. As noted above, \n     the comments received in response to this question are \n     summarized and discussed in the NPRM regarding the \n     application of the FLSA, which is being published today in \n     the Congressional Record.\n       Based on the comments and the Board's understanding of the \n     law and the institutions to which it is being made \n     applicable, the Board has decided to issue the FMLA \n     regulations with only limited and necessary modifications to \n     the Secretary's regulations. In making the FMLA applicable, \n     the CAA changed the key definition of ``eligible employee,'' \n     and the Board therefore proposes to make a corresponding \n     modification to the definition of ``eligible employee'' in \n     the Secretary's regulations. Certain conforming amendments \n     and technical changes in the nomenclature of the Secretary's \n     regulations have also been proposed, and those sections that \n     are clearly inapplicable have specifically not been proposed \n     for adoption by the Board. These proposed modifications to \n     the Secretary's regulations are discussed below.\n     2. Notice posting and recordkeeping\n       The ANPRM also invited comment on whether the notice \n     posting and recordkeeping requirements of the various laws \n     made applicable by the CAA are incorporated as statutory \n     requirements of the CAA. The ANPRM inquired whether, if such \n     requirements were not incorporated, could and should the \n     Board develop its own requirements pursuant to its ``good \n     cause'' authority. The ANPRM also invited comment on \n     proposing guidelines and models for recordkeeping and notice \n     posting. As noted above, the comments received in response to \n     these questions are summarized and discussed in the NPRM \n     regarding the application of the FLSA.\n       The Board agrees with those commenters who took the \n     position that, if employing offices are to be treated the \n     same as private sector employers are treated under the FMLA, \n     they should have to comply with the statute's notice posting \n     and recordkeeping requirements. Moreover, the Board notes \n     that notice posting and recordkeeping promote the full and \n     effective enforcement of incorporated rights and protections. \n     In the Board's view, notice posting and recordkeeping may \n     well be in employers' interests both as a sound personnel \n     practice and in order to defend against subsequent \n     litigation.\n       But, while the CAA incorporates certain specific sections \n     of the FMLA, the CAA explicitly did not incorporate the \n     notice posting and recordkeeping requirements of Sections 109 \n     and 106(b), of the FMLA. For the reasons discussed with \n     respect to the FLSA, as the CAA has not incorporated the \n     notice posting and recordkeeping requirements of the FMLA, \n     the Board will not do so. Accordingly, the Board proposes \n     not to adopt sections 825.300 and 825.500 of the \n     Secretary's FMLA regulations.\n       For similar reasons, the Board is proposing not to adopt a \n     provision of section 825.110(c) of the Secretary's \n     regulations. Section 825.110(c) addresses the question of how \n     to determine whether the 1,250-hour leave-eligibility \n     requirement has been satisfied. This section states that the \n     principles established under the Fair Labor Standards Act \n     (FLSA) will be used, and states further that, if an employer \n     does not maintain an accurate record of hours worked, the \n     employer has the burden of showing that the employee has not \n     worked the requisite number of hours. Section 825.110(c) \n     further provides that, in the event the employer is unable to \n     meet this burden, the employee is deemed to have met the \n     test. Section 101(2)(C) of the FMLA states that, for purposes \n     of determining whether an employee worked the requisite 1,250 \n     hours, the legal standards established under the FLSA shall \n     apply. Although section 101(2)(C) of the FMLA incorporates \n     the recordkeeping requirements of the FLSA, the Board has \n     concluded that section 101(2)(C) does not make the FLSA \n     recordkeeping requirements applicable under the CAA. This is \n     because, by excluding the FLSA recordkeeping requirements \n     from the FLSA provisions of the CAA, Congress indicated its \n     intent that those recordkeeping requirements should not apply \n     with respect to any CAA requirement. Accordingly, the Board \n     has concluded that the legal authority supporting the \n     Secretary's regulatory provision regarding burdens was not \n     incorporated into the FMLA provisions of the CAA, and this \n     regulatory provision is not included in the Board's proposed \n     regulations.\n       The Board notes, however, that, as a practical matter, \n     implementation of the FMLA, as made applicable by the CAA, \n     requires an adequate system of keeping records. Such records \n     will be needed, for example, for the employing office to know \n     when employees have satisfied the 12-months and 1,250-hours \n     of service for eligibility, and to keep track of how much \n     FMLA leave each employee has taken during a leave year. As \n     various commenters suggest, the Board will provide guidance \n     to employing offices concerning model recordkeeping practices \n     as part of carrying out its program of education under \n     section 301(h)of the CAA (2 U.S.C. 1381(h)).\n       The Board would also note, as it did in the NPRM involving \n     the application of the rights and protections of the FLSA, \n     that the absence of recordkeeping and notice posting \n     requirements may create a void which can only partially be \n     filled by the program of education to be carried out by the \n     Board. The Board also would emphasize that employees will in \n     many circumstances be able to establish a prima facie case \n     simply by their own testimony where the employing office has \n     failed to maintain adequate, accurate records and an \n     employing office may find that its ability to respond to an \n     employee's prima facie case is substantially burdened by its \n     failure to keep accurate records. If Congress wishes to \n     experience the same burdens as faced by the private sector \n     and also to address these issues, it should enact \n     recordkeeping requirements comparable to those of the FMLA. \n     (Of course, like the regulations under the FMLA, such \n     recordkeeping requirements may leave to the discretion of \n     each employing office the precise form and manner in which \n     records will be kept.) But, in light of the text and \n     structure of the CAA, the Board believes that it is up to \n     Congress to decide whether to do so.\n       Finally, section 825.304(c) of the Secretary's regulations \n     refers to the posting of notices without mandating such \n     posting. Section 825.304 implements section 102(e) of the \n     FMLA which requires that an employee give the employer at \n     least 30 days'' advance notice of any foreseeable FMLA leave. \n     The regulation provides that, if such notice is not provided, \n     the employer may delay the taking of FMLA leave until at \n     least 30 days after the date of actual notice from the \n     employee. However, in order for the onset of leave to be \n     delayed for lack of required notice, paragraph (c) requires \n     that it must be clear that the employee had actual notice of \n     the FMLA notice requirements. Finally, the paragraph offers \n     that ``This condition would be satisfied by the employer's \n     proper posting of the required notice at the worksite where \n     the employee is employed.'' Because this regulation \n     implements section 102(e) of the FMLA, the Board believes \n     that it must be adopted, absent good cause to modify it. Only \n     a minor modification is needed. Under section 301(h) of the \n     CAA, the Office must distribute information to employing \n     offices in a form suitable for posting, but there is no \n     requirement that the information actually be posted. \n     Accordingly, the Board proposes to refer not to the \n     ``required notice'', but to the ``information distributed by \n     the Office suitable for posting''.\n     3. May an employee aggregate months and hours worked at more \n         than one employing office to satisfy the 12-months and \n         1,250-hours of work conditions for eligibility?\n       Both the FMLA and the CAA include definitions of ``eligible \n     employee'' which require that, to be eligible for FMLA leave, \n     an employee must first have been employed for 12 months and \n     for at least 1,250 hours during the previous 12-month period. \n     However, the wording of the two definitions is significantly \n     different.\n       The FMLA definition of ``eligible employee'' requires \n     employment for at least 12 months ``by the employer with \n     respect to whom leave is requested'' and for at least 1,250 \n     hours of service during the previous 12 months with ``such \n     employer''. In contrast, under section 202(a)(2)(B) of the \n     CAA, an ``eligible employee'' is defined as a covered \n     employee who has been employed in ``any employing office for \n     12 months and for at least 1,250 hours of employment during \n     the previous 12 months''. It is clear that the FMLA \n     definition requires that the 12 months and 1,250 hours must \n     have been worked for the same employer from which the \n     employee requests leave. However, the CAA is ambiguous as to \n     whether an employee who worked for more than one employing \n     office can aggregate the months and hours of employment from \n     more than one employing offices to satisfy the 12-month and \n     1,250-hour requirements.\n       Accordingly, the ANPRM asked: Whether and, if so, how the \n     12 months and 1,250 hours of work should be calculated for \n     employees who worked for more than one employing office.\n       Commenters expressed opposing views on this question:\n       One commenter argued that each employing office, in \n     practice and under the CAA, is a separate, independent \n     employer. Therefore, ``employing offices'' under the CAA \n     should be treated the same as ``employers'' under the FMLA. \n     Under this view, except in unusual circumstances, an employee \n     must have worked for 12 months, and for 1,250 hours within \n     the previous 12 months, for the particular employing office \n     from which leave is requested.\n       Another commenter argued that employing offices under the \n     CAA should be treated the same as part of a single \n     institutional ``employer'' under the FMLA. The Board should \n     treat employing offices as part of a single employer. In this \n     view, employing offices would be analogous to the separate \n     ``establishments'' or ``divisions'' of a single corporate \n     employer.\n       A third view, with respect to the 1,250-hour requirement, \n     was presented by another commenter. For employees who are \n     employed by more than one employing office, the Board \n\n[[Page S 17629]]\n     should make clear that hours of employment in each employing office \n     will be considered when determining whether or not the 1,250 \n     hour threshold has been met.\n       The Board believes that the language of the CAA is \n     ambiguous. According to the dictionary, among several \n     possible meanings, the term ``any'' may mean ``one (no matter \n     which one) of more than two'', or it may mean ``every''. \n     Webster's New Universal Unabridged Dictionary (deluxe 2d ed., \n     1983). If the first meaning were applied, the 12 months and \n     1,250 hours would have to be accrued in one single employing \n     office; if the second meaning were applied, the months and \n     hours could be aggregated from every employment office where \n     the employee worked.\n       The Board has concluded that the better understanding of \n     the CAA language is the latter one. The FMLA definition is \n     explicit that the 12 months must have been served with ``the \n     employer with respect to whom leave is requested'', and the \n     1,250 hours of service must also have been with ``such \n     employer''. However, in the CAA, Congress substituted the \n     phrase ``any employing office'' in place of the FMLA's \n     precise reference to the particular employer from whom leave \n     is requested. It therefore appears that eligibility should be \n     determined on the basis of months and hours worked for \n     employing offices other than just the one from which the \n     leave is requested.2\n      2 This interpretation is consistent with the section-by-\n     section analysis placed in the Congressional Record by \n     Senator Grassley on behalf of himself and Senator Lieberman. \n     Congressional Record, page S 623, col. 3 (Jan. 9, 1995).\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n       Based on the Board's understanding of the meaning of the \n     CAA, the Board proposes to modify the regulations as \n     promulgated by the Secretary--(1) to incorporate the \n     definition of ``eligible employee'' as set forth in section \n     202 of the CAA, and (2) to include language clarifying that, \n     where an employee works for two or more employing offices, \n     the months and hours worked will be aggregated for purposes \n     of determining eligibility. (See Sec. Sec. 825.110, 825.800 \n     of the proposed regulations.)\n     4. Should the Board's regulations retain the House of \n         Representatives rule under which employees are eligible \n         for FMLA leave immediately upon employment?\n       Title V of the FMLA has applied certain rights and \n     protections to the House and Senate since August 1993. \n     Section 502, which applies to the House of Representatives, \n     and rules adopted in the House to implement section 502, \n     provide that House employees become eligible for FMLA leave \n     immediately, without any minimum months or hours of \n     employment.\n       In response to the ANPRM, some commenters questioned \n     whether the Board should retain this approach for the House. \n     Certain commenters argued that making FMLA leave immediately \n     applicable in the House is based on the maximum two-year \n     employment period in the House, which comes to a discrete end \n     in the House at the conclusion of each Congress. Immediate \n     eligibility allegedly diminishes many of the anticipated \n     problems and issues regarding the administration of the leave \n     year, treatment of joint employer status, and inconsistency \n     of application. Accordingly, they urged the Board to retain \n     current immediate eligibility for the House. Other commenters \n     urged the opposite--i.e., that the Board should retain the \n     private-sector eligibility requirements of 12 months and \n     1,250 hours.\n       The Board recognizes that the two-year employment cycle of \n     the House of Representatives creates terms and conditions of \n     employment which differ from the private sector. The Board \n     also recognizes that at least some within the House of \n     Representatives believe that immediate FMLA eligibility is an \n     important element of an appropriate FMLA program for the \n     House. However, for the Board's regulations to make House \n     employees immediately eligible for FMLA leave would go beyond \n     the express terms of the CAA.\n       Of course, neither the FMLA, as applied by the CAA, nor the \n     regulations being proposed by the Board, would forbid the \n     House from establishing a more generous leave program under \n     its own authority. See Sec. 403 of the FMLA (applied by \n     Sec. 225(f)(1) of the CAA); Sec. 825.700 of the proposed \n     regulations. These provisions state that employing offices \n     are not intended to be discouraged from adopting or retaining \n     leave policies more generous than any policies that comply \n     with FMLA requirements. Therefore, individual employing \n     offices remain free to grant leave to employees immediately \n     upon employment, and nothing in the FMLA, as applied by the \n     CAA, should affect any ability of the House to mandate \n     immediate leave-eligibility for all House employing offices \n     under its own authority. This should enable the House to \n     retain much of the value of its current FMLA program, if the \n     House determines that it wishes to retain immediate \n     eligibility for leave.\n       The Board recognizes that, if the House decides to grant \n     leave to employees who do not satisfy the CAA definition of \n     an ``eligible employee,'' attention must be paid to the \n     question of how such leave would be treated under both FMLA \n     and FLSA, as made applicable by the CAA. For example, an \n     employing office may wish to ``dock'' an employee's pay for \n     leave taken for partial-day absences. However, \n     Sec. 825.206(c) of the Board's proposed regulations provide: \n     ``Hourly or other deductions which are not in accordance with \n     [applicable requirements under FLSA regulations] may not be \n     taken, for example, where the employee has not worked long \n     enough to be eligible for FMLA leave without potentially \n     affecting the employee's eligibility for exemption [from FLSA \n     requirements].'' Furthermore, in preamble language to the \n     Secretary's FMLA regulations, the Secretary stated: ``Leave \n     granted under circumstances that do not meet FMLA's coverage, \n     eligibility, or specified reasons for FMLA-qualifying leave \n     may not be counted against FMLA's 12-week entitlement.'' 60 \n     Fed. Reg. 2230, col. 1 (Jan. 6, 1995).\n       In light of all of these factors, the Board does not \n     believe that good cause exists for the Board's regulations to \n     make House employees immediately eligible for FMLA leave.\n     5. Should the Board designate a uniform leave year?\n       As noted above, title V of the FMLA made certain rights and \n     protections under the FMLA available to employees of the \n     House and Senate. On August 5, 1993, the House Committee on \n     House Administration adopted regulations and forms to \n     implement the FMLA in the House. Among other things, these \n     rules designated the period from January 3 of one year \n     through January 2 of the following year as the FMLA ``leave \n     year'' for all employers of the House. (The term ``leave \n     year'' is used here to refer to the 12-month period within \n     which the 12 weeks of leave may be taken.) This regulation \n     has been retained by the Committee on House Oversight. \n     However, section 502 of the FMLA, upon which the House \n     regulations were based, is repealed by the CAA effective \n     January 23, 1996.\n        With this as background, the ANPRM posed the following \n     question: whether there is ``good cause'' to believe that \n     designating a uniform FMLA leave year would be ``more \n     effective'' for implementation of the rights and protections \n     of the CAA than the regulations promulgated by the Secretary. \n     The Secretary's regulations provide considerable freedom to \n     employers to designate the 12-month period appropriate to \n     their office.\n        Several commenters supported the use of a uniform leave \n     year, and urged the Board to retain a uniform year in its \n     rules, at least for the House. Other commenters disagreed.\n       Favoring the uniform leave year:\n       Certain commenters argued that the January 3 through \n     January 2 period is based on the maximum two year employment \n     period in the House, which comes to a discrete end at the \n     conclusion of each Congress. Because this two-year employment \n     cycle is unique to the House, the Board's regulations should \n     ``retain'' the current, uniform manner in which FMLA is \n     applied to the House, as a more effective way to implement \n     the FMLA than the various options for defining leave years \n     available under the Secretary's regulations. Furthermore, the \n     uniform leave year is much easier to implement and \n     understand, so that employees are less likely to lose their \n     rights.\n       Another commenter pointed out that joint employment is very \n     common in Congress, and argued that applying different leave \n     years will cause administration to be problematic.\n       Opposing a uniform leave year:\n       Other commenters were doubtful of the need for the Board to \n     establish a uniform leave year for the House, and saw no \n     reason why employing offices should be denied flexibility.\n       Another commenter clearly took a position opposed to \n     establishing a uniform leave year for the Senate. Each \n     employing office should be allowed to choose any method \n     allowed by the Secretary's regulations, and there is no \n     ``good cause'' to restrict employers' choice.\n       The Board recognizes that the use of a uniform leave year \n     may have advantages. However, there is also value in allowing \n     employing offices the flexibility to apply a leave year that \n     is appropriate to the office's circumstances.\n       Much of the advantage of a uniform leave year, as described \n     by the commenters, involves making the FMLA program easier \n     for the employing offices and for the House payroll and \n     administrative offices to administer. However, nothing in the \n     FMLA, as applied by the CAA, or in the regulations being \n     proposed by the Board thereunder, would forbid the House from \n     retaining these benefits by retaining its uniform leave year \n     under the House's own authority. Under the FMLA and the \n     Secretary's regulations, each employer is free to select a \n     leave year. The Board is unaware of anything in the FMLA or \n     the Secretary's regulations that would forbid House employing \n     offices from establishing a uniform leave year for \n     themselves, either by voluntary agreement among employing \n     offices, or by establishing a uniform year under the House's \n     authority of self-regulation. (Senate employing offices \n     would, of course, also be free to consider a uniform leave \n     year for some or all Senate employing offices, if they so \n     desire.)\n        The Board also recognizes that use of a uniform leave year \n     may provide some benefits and protections for eligible \n     employees. When employees transfer from one employing office \n     to another, or when they work simultaneously for more than \n     one employing office, the application of different leave \n     years by different employing offices could cause confusion \n     and, in some circumstances, could limit flexibility by \n     forcing an employee to fit leave within the constraints of \n     differently defined years. This concern is discussed below, \n     under the topic of whether the \n\n[[Page S 17630]]\n     use of different leave years would affect FMLA leave rights. As noted, \n     when an employee works jointly for two or more employing \n     offices that apply inconsistent leave years, the employing \n     offices will have to apply a single leave year for the \n     employee.\n        For these reasons, the Board does not believe that there \n     is good cause to mandate a uniform leave year.\n      6. Should the definitions of ``joint employer'', \n         ``integrated employer'', or ``successor employer'' be \n         retained or modified?\n        In the ANPRM, the Board explained that, under certain \n     circumstances under the Secretary's FMLA regulations, two or \n     more employers of the same employee may be treated as a \n     single employer. The concepts under which this may be done \n     are set forth within the provisions applicable to ``joint \n     employers'', ``integrated employers'', and ``successor \n     employers.''\n        Accordingly, the ANPRM asked for comment regarding: \n     Whether and, if so, how the definitions of ``joint \n     employer'', ``integrated employer'', or ``successor \n     employer'' set forth in the regulations promulgated by the \n     Secretary should be applied and/or modified.\n        Commenters offered several varying proposals on how these \n     definitions should be modified.\n       One commenter suggested that, where an employee works \n     concurrently for more than one employing office, the \n     employing offices might jointly decide which of the employing \n     offices will be designated the ``primary'' employer for \n     purposes of FMLA compliance.\n       Another commenter suggested that ``joint employment'' will \n     occur in the House where an employee is under the actual \n     direction and control of a Member, even if another employing \n     authority, such as a committee, performs a ministerial \n     function with respect to payroll administration.\n       A commenter stated that no two employing offices in the \n     Senate are ever ``under common control''. A ``joint \n     employer'' relationship was said to exist in the Senate in \n     only three situations: (a) an employee supplied by a \n     temporary or leasing agency or supplied by another agency on \n     detail, (b) working in two Senators' joint home office, or \n     (c) working on common issues or other matters for more \n     than one employing office. Where there is no ``primary'' \n     employer, all must designate a single leave year for all \n     of their joint employees. The commenter also stated that \n     the concepts of integrated employer and successors in \n     interest are not applicable to the Senate.\n       Another commenter suggested that, in the case of joint \n     employment, reinstatement rights should apply with respect to \n     both joint employers.\n       Finally, a commenter suggested that the Board should adopt \n     the Department of Labor's regulations and allow each \n     employing office to interpret them.\n        Integrated employer. The Secretary's regulations use the \n     term ``integrated employers'' to refer to employers that are \n     so closely connected that they are deemed a single entity. \n     Under these regulations, whether employers are an \n     ``integrated employer'' is determined by review of the entire \n     relationship, and the factors to be considered ``include': \n     (i) common management, (ii) interrelation between operations, \n     (iii) centralized control of labor relations, and (iv) common \n     ownership/financial control.\n       If two employing offices were to be considered an \n     ``integrated employer'' under the FMLA as applied by the CAA, \n     employee eligibility and employer coverage would not be \n     affected because employing offices are covered regardless of \n     size, and employees'' months and hours worked for any \n     employing offices are aggregated for determining eligibility. \n     However, being deemed an ``integrated employer'' may have \n     implications for the determining employing offices'' \n     compliance obligations, so the concept of ``integrated \n     employer'' should not be discarded as irrelevant.\n        The first three criteria listed in the Secretary's \n     regulation--i.e., common management, interrelated operations, \n     and centralized control of labor relations--appear to be \n     clearly relevant and appropriate to determining whether two \n     or more offices should be considered a single employing \n     office. One commenter argued that the fourth criterion--\n     common ownership/financial control--is foreign to the Senate. \n     The Board agrees that ``common ownership'' is inapplicable to \n     employing offices and their employees, and proposes not to \n     adopt it. ``Financial control'' would probably not be \n     applicable to employing offices in ordinary circumstances, \n     but, in light of the fact that this criterion might prove to \n     be useful in dealing with some unanticipated circumstance, \n     the Board sees no need to omit this criterion.\n        For these reasons, the Board does not believe that there \n     is good cause to omit the regulation on ``integrated \n     employer,'' and the Board proposes only to delete the \n     reference to ``common ownership'' from the regulation.\n       Successor in interest. Like the ``integrated employer'' \n     provision, the ``successor in interest'' concept has no \n     implications for whether employees are eligible or employing \n     offices are covered. However, some situations may arise where \n     the concept of successorship will be relevant. For example, \n     if committee jurisdictions are restructured, it may be \n     necessary to determine which, if any, of the surviving \n     committees is the ``successor in interest'' to the former \n     committee. Thus, determining the successor may be important \n     in determining whether a remaining committee must grant leave \n     for an eligible employee who provided adequate notice to the \n     former committee, or must continue leave begun while an \n     employee was employed by the former committee.\n       The concept of ``successor in interest'' is developed in \n     section 825.107 of the Secretary's regulations. The \n     regulations state that a determination of whether a \n     ``successor in interest'' exists is determined by the \n     ``entire circumstances * * * viewed in their totality''. The \n     regulation also states: ``The factors to be considered \n     include: (1) Substantial continuity of the same business \n     operations; (2) Use of the same plant; (3) Continuity of the \n     work force; (4) Similarity of jobs and working conditions; \n     (5) Similarity of supervisory personnel; (6) Similarity of \n     machinery, equipment, and production methods; (7) Similarity \n     of products or services; and (8) The ability of the \n     predecessor to provide relief.''\n        The Board is concerned that several of the factors listed \n     in 29 C.F.R. Sec. 825.107 are largely inapplicable. Except \n     for a few shops, employing offices do not have ``business \n     operations''. Few employing offices have a ``plant'', \n     ``machinery, equipment, and production methods'' or \n     ``products or services''. Accordingly, the Board proposes not \n     to adopt Sec. 825.107 of the Secretary's regulations. \n     Although the Board would wish to provide guidance on how the \n     concept of ``successor employer'' would be applied under the \n     CAA, it is impossible at this point to foresee how \n     successorship will arise in the unique context of employing \n     offices covered under the CAA. Accordingly, the \n     determinations as to successorship may be addressed in future \n     rulemaking or in case-by-case adjudication. In the latter \n     situation, litigants may raise the question of successorship, \n     and the Board would expect that common-law or other \n     recognized principles of successorship might be considered or \n     applied by the hearing officer, the Board, or a court.\n        Joint employers. The ``joint employer'' definition also \n     would not affect employee eligibility, because hours of work \n     are aggregated for eligibility purposes. However, the concept \n     of joint employment is important for determining which \n     employing office or employing offices have responsibility for \n     FMLA compliance. The Board proposes that the regulatory \n     section on joint employment can be adopted with relatively \n     little revision. Examples of joint employment described in \n     comments could be appropriately evaluated with reference to \n     the criteria set forth in the regulation. For example, where \n     an employee on a committee payroll is under the actual \n     direction and control of a Member of the House of \n     Representatives or a Senator, it may be relevant to consider \n     whether the committee is acting ``in the interest of'' the \n     Member's or Senator's personal office in relation to the \n     employee, or whether the committee and the personal office \n     are under ``common control'' with respect to the employee's \n     employment. (See Sec. Sec. 825.106(a)(2)-(3) of these \n     proposed regulations.) The Board therefore proposes to add to \n     the regulation a reference to examples of joint employment \n     proposed in comments.\n       Finally, the Board acknowledges the view expressed by some \n     commenters, that there may not be a primary employer in every \n     instance of joint employment, and that joint employers \n     should, by agreement, designate which single employing office \n     will be responsible for compliance with FMLA obligations with \n     respect to the joint employee. However, any such agreement \n     cannot relieve the other joint employing offices of any \n     FMLA responsibilities that are not fulfilled.\n     7. Whether the use of different leave years by different \n         employing offices would affect the FMLA leave rights of \n         ``eligible employees'' who are employed by more than one \n         employing office?\n       Finally, the Board in the ANPRM recognized that a uniform \n     leave year might not be required under Board regulations, and \n     therefore asked for comment whether the lack of uniformity \n     could jeopardize employees' leave rights. The Board suggested \n     that this question be considered in light of the definition \n     of ``joint employer'', ``integrated employer'', and \n     ``successor employer''.\n       A commenter distinguished the situation of joint employment \n     from the situation of independent employment. In the case of \n     joint employment, if there is no primary employer, all of the \n     employers must jointly designate a leave year for the joint \n     employees. If an employee works at separate times for \n     separate, independent employers, the employers may designate \n     different leave years without depriving the employee of any \n     FMLA rights. If an employee moves from joint employment to \n     become employed by only one of the employers, or moves from \n     being employed by one employer to being employed by that and \n     another employer jointly, and if the applicable leave year \n     therefore changes, the procedure under Sec. 825.200(d)(1) \n     would apply. (Under this section, when an employer chooses to \n     shift from one leave year to another, the employee is \n     authorized to take advantage of whichever leave year is more \n     beneficial.)\n       A commenter suggested that the regulations should authorize \n     joint House employing offices to designate which one will be \n     the ``primary'' employer responsible for fulfilling FMLA \n     responsibilities.\n       Furthermore, as noted above, commenters argued that a \n     uniform leave year is easier to understand, so that employees \n     are less likely \n\n[[Page S 17631]]\n     to lose their FMLA rights through inadvertence or otherwise, and that, \n     if employing offices adopt different leave years, \n     administration of the FMLA requirements would be problematic.\n       The Board recognizes that the use of inconsistent leave \n     years may make implementation of FMLA provisions of the CAA \n     more complicated, and might have some impact on employees who \n     transfer from one employing office to another or who work \n     independently for more than one employing office. However, \n     where an employee is employed jointly by employing offices \n     that ordinarily use different leave years, commenters \n     suggested that the joint employers either (1) designate one \n     employer whose leave year will apply, or (2) jointly \n     designate an applicable leave year. Another commenter \n     suggested that, where an employee transfers between being \n     jointly employed and being employed by only one of the \n     employing offices, the procedures under Sec. 825.200(d)(1) \n     could apply. These approaches would not appear to raise \n     difficulties, provided the employee's FMLA entitlement is not \n     compromised.\n       In light of these considerations, the Board does not \n     believe that there is good cause to modify the Secretary's \n     regulations with respect to the possibility that different \n     employing offices will apply different leave years.\n\n                        C. Other drafting issues\n\n       Finally, in developing the regulations proposed in this \n     notice, in addition to the policy issues discussed above, the \n     Board considered the following drafting issues:\n       1. Worksite eligibility. Section 101(2)(B)(ii) of the FMLA \n     denies eligibility to any employee at a worksite where the \n     employer employs less than 50 employees if the total number \n     of employees employed within a 75-mile radius is less than \n     50. This criterion is a ``size limitation'' that, under \n     section 225(f)(2) of the CAA, does not apply under the CAA. \n     Accordingly, a number of regulatory provisions relating to \n     this worksite eligibility criterion are not included in the \n     regulations proposed by the Board. These omitted provisions \n     include some or all of 29 C.F.R. Sec. Sec. 825.105, \n     825.106(d), 825.110(a)(3), 825.110(f), 825.111, 825.206(c), \n     825.220(b)(1).\n       2. State and local law. The Department of Labor's \n     regulations contain numerous provisions that address or touch \n     upon the relationship between the FMLA and State or local law \n     addressing leave or related matters. Since State and local \n     law do not govern the employment relationship of covered \n     employees and employing offices, these references to State \n     and local law are omitted from the regulations being proposed \n     by the Board. These omitted provisions include some or all of \n     29 C.F.R. Sec. Sec. 825.200(d)(2), 825.201, 825.202(c), \n     825.204(b), 825.206(c), 825.701, and other sections.\n       3. Consideration of periods before the CAA effective date. \n     The CAA takes effect on January 23, 1996. Under the \n     Secretary's regulations implementing FMLA, employment with a \n     covered employer before the effective date of the FMLA \n     (August 5, 1993) is to be counted in determining whether an \n     employee is ``eligible'' for FMLA leave. 29 C.F.R. \n     Sec. 825.102. Similarly, the Secretary's regulations provide \n     that leave starting on and after the FMLA effective date is \n     considered FMLA leave which can be counted against an \n     employee's 12-week entitlement. Such leave is qualifying \n     under the FMLA even if the event occasioning the need for \n     leave (e.g., the birth of a child) occurred before the \n     effective date. 29 C.F.R. Sec. 825.103. See also 29 C.F.R. \n     Sec. 825.200(b)(4).\n       The proposed regulations adopt the Secretary's general \n     approach regarding the effective date; however, the \n     applicable effective dates for application of the rights and \n     protections of the FMLA in the Congress are somewhat more \n     complicated. The CAA, and its application of the rights and \n     protections of the FMLA, takes effect on January 23, 1996. \n     Section 202(e)(1) of the CAA. However, certain rights and \n     protections of the FMLA applied to employees of the House of \n     Representatives, the Senate, and certain employees of \n     congressional instrumentalities under Title V of the FMLA, \n     effective August 5, 1993. The proposed regulations harmonize \n     these preexisting applications of FMLA rights and protections \n     with application of those rights and protections under the \n     CAA.\n       The proposed regulations state that an employing office \n     must consider periods of employment before January 23, 1996 \n     when determining if its employees are eligible for leave. \n     Similarly, a covered employee is entitled to FMLA leave if \n     the reason for the leave is qualifying under the FMLA as made \n     applicable by the CAA, even if the event occasioning the \n     leave (such as the birth of a child) occurred before January \n     23, 1996. However, leave taken before January 23, 1996, if it \n     was FMLA-qualifying leave taken from an employing office \n     subject to Title V of the FMLA, may be counted against the \n     employee's leave entitlement after January 23, 1996. See \n     Sec. Sec. 825.102(b), 825.103, 825.200(b)(4).\n       The Board is cognizant of the principle that agencies may \n     not promulgate regulations which have a retroactive effect \n     unless expressly authorized by the enabling statute. Landgraf \n     v. USI Film Products, 114 S.Ct. 1483, 1496 (1994). However, \n     the Board concludes that consideration of periods of \n     employment and events prior to the effective date of the CAA \n     under the sections of the proposed regulations cited above \n     does not constitute a retroactive application of the CAA. \n     Unlike retroactive regulations, which ``impair rights a party \n     possessed when he acted, increase a party's liability for \n     past conduct, or impose new duties with respect to \n     transactions already completed,'' 114 S.Ct. 1505, these \n     regulations simply ``alter the future legal effect of past \n     transactions--so-called secondary retroactivity,'' which does \n     not violate the presumption against retroactivity. 114 S.Ct. \n     at 1526 n.3 (Scalia, J. concurring). The regulations do not \n     penalize an employing office for a refusal to grant an FMLA \n     leave prior to the effective date of the CAA. They only state \n     that employment and events occurring prior to the effective \n     date of the CAA may be considered in determining the \n     employer's obligation to honor a leave request on or after \n     the effective date.\n       4. Minimally paid leave in the Senate. A commenter \n     explained that the Senate currently provides minimally paid \n     leave rather than unpaid leave under title V of the FMLA. The \n     Secretary's regulations authorize providing greater benefits \n     or pay than is required under the FMLA, and providing greater \n     benefits and pay does not prevent the leave from being \n     considered FMLA-qualifying leave. See section 825.700. \n     Accordingly, the Board does not believe that the situation of \n     minimally paid leave by the Senate needs to be addressed in \n     the proposed regulations.\n       5. Local educational agencies and private elementary and \n     secondary schools. Section 108 of the FMLA provides special \n     rules for local educational agencies and for private \n     elementary and secondary schools. Section 108 was not \n     expressly referenced in section 202 of the CAA. However, the \n     Board believes that section 108 establishes exemptions from \n     certain requirements of those FMLA sections that are \n     referenced in section 202. The provisions of section 108 \n     therefore apply pursuant to section 225(f)(1) of the CAA. \n     Accordingly, regulations implementing section 108 are \n     included in the regulations being proposed by the Board.\n       6. Notices other than by posting of notices. As discussed \n     above, the Board is not proposing regulations on the posting \n     of notices because the statutory authority in the FMLA \n     requiring notice posting was not incorporated into the CAA. \n     However, the Board is proposing to adopt several regulations, \n     based on the Secretary's regulations, that require both \n     employing office and employees to provide notices to each \n     other. The Board is proposing to adopt these notification \n     requirements because they are based on regulations that the \n     Secretary promulgated to implement section 101 through 105 of \n     the FMLA, which are incorporated into the CAA.\n       For example, section 103(a) of the FMLA authorizes the \n     employer to require that a request for leave be supported by \n     a medical certification. This requirement is implemented by \n     section 825.305 of the Secretary's regulations, which \n     provides for the employer to give notice of any such \n     requirement. Another example is FMLA section 104(a)(4), which \n     authorizes an employer to have a uniformly applied ``practice \n     or policy'' that requires employees to provide certification \n     of fitness for duty upon returning from leave. The \n     Secretary's regulations at section 825.310(e) require that, \n     as part of a notice given to each employee who advises the \n     employer of need for FMLA leave, the employer must advise the \n     employee if a fitness-for-duty certification will be \n     required. Furthermore, this section requires that, if the \n     employer has an employee handbook, the employer must include \n     in the handbook an explanation of the employer's general \n     policy regarding any requirement for fitness-for-duty \n     certification.\n       Section 825.301 of the Secretary's regulations requires the \n     employer to provide a number of these notices in two \n     consolidated formats. Under paragraph (b), the employer must \n     provide a notice to each employee who informs the employer of \n     need to take FMLA leave. This notice must inform the employee \n     of whether the employee designates the leave as qualifying \n     for FMLA leave, whether the employer requires certification \n     of a health care provider, and numerous other matters. \n     Paragraph (a) requires the employer to provide information on \n     FMLA rights and responsibilities, together with a statement \n     of the employer's policies regarding FMLA, as part of the \n     employee handbook, if any. If there is no such handbook, the \n     employer must include this information with the notice \n     provided to employees who give notice that they need FMLA \n     leave.\n       A Senate commenter suggested that paragraph (b) should not \n     be adopted by the Board because there is no requirement in \n     the FMLA, as incorporated in the CAA, for the employer to \n     provide such notice. However, the Board believes that these \n     notification requirements implement the general rights and \n     protections of sections 101 through 105, which are \n     incorporated in the CAA. The Board is not aware of good cause \n     why these requirements should be excluded from the \n     regulations under the CAA.\n       7. Medical and other benefits. In Sec. 825.209(a), in the \n     definition of group health plans, the proposed regulations \n     include an added reference to the Federal Employee Health \n     Benefits Program, which applies to many covered employees. \n     The Secretary's regulations identified certain laws governing \n     benefits that may impose requirements above and beyond those \n     of FMLA. However, other benefit requirements apply to covered \n     employees and employing offices under federal statute and \n     under rules and practices of the House, Senate, and \n     Congressional instrumentalities. The Board sees no need to \n     conform the FMLA regulations to the various laws and rules \n     that govern employee benefits. Instead, the Board proposes to \n     add to the regulations \n\n[[Page S 17632]]\n     an explicit recognition that there may be other applicable laws. E.g., \n     proposed Sec. Sec. 825.209(f), 825.309(b). However, covered \n     employees and employing offices must understand that these \n     regulations do not set forth all applicable requirements \n     regarding benefits for covered employees on leave. Other \n     sources must be consulted to determine applicable laws and \n     rules other than those applied by the CAA. The Board is not \n     aware of any way in which laws or rules applicable to covered \n     employees may interfere with the power of employing offices \n     to fully comply with the requirements of the FMLA.\n       Furthermore, a commenter suggested that certain regulatory \n     provisions regarding payment and reimbursement of insurance \n     premiums should refer to the Senate as well as, or instead \n     of, to the employing office. The Board understands that such \n     financial transactions are not undertaken by Senate employing \n     offices directly. This reality is briefly acknowledged in an \n     introductory explanatory provision, at Sec. 825.100(b). \n     However, the CAA makes the employing office responsible for \n     assuring that all requirements of the FMLA, as applied by the \n     CAA, are complied with. For this reason, the disbursing or \n     other administrative office of the Senate may be viewed as \n     functioning as an agent for the employing office, and the \n     Board does not believe that the regulatory requirements need \n     to be modified to refer to the Senate directly.\n       Regarding another of the Secretary's regulations, the \n     commenter suggested that a reference to ``the insurer'' \n     should be deleted and replaced with a reference to the \n     Senate. The Board recognizes that, in some situations, the \n     Senate may serve as the intermediary between the employee and \n     the insurer. In such circumstances, the employee would make \n     arrangements with the insurer by means of making arrangements \n     with the Senate. Accordingly, the Board does not believe that \n     this suggested change is necessary.\n       The proposed regulations also omit, as inapplicable, a \n     section on multi-employer health plans (Sec. 825.211) and a \n     reference to the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of \n     1974 (ERISA) (in Sec. 825.215(d)).\n       8. Charging leave taken from a prior employing office \n     against the employee's FMLA entitlement. A commenter urged \n     that the Board's regulations should make it clear that, even \n     when an employee transfers from one employing office to \n     another, the employee does not become entitled to more than \n     12 weeks of leave in the applicable 12-month period.\n       To clarify this point, the Board proposes to amend the \n     regulation that allows an employer to count an employee's \n     FMLA leave against the employee's remaining 12-week FMLA \n     entitlement. The existing Labor Department regulations \n     implicitly assume that an employer may designate leave as \n     FMLA leave and then count it against the employee's remaining \n     entitlement. However, the regulations do not address the \n     situation where FMLA leave taken from one employing office is \n     counted by a subsequent employing office against the \n     employee's total FMLA leave entitlement. This situation is \n     not addressed in the Department of Labor regulations, \n     because, in the private sector, no leave taken from a prior \n     employer is of any relevance to a subsequent employer. The \n     employee loses FMLA eligibility for at least 12 months after \n     changing jobs, so leave taken from the former employer will \n     be over 12 months old by the time the employee is eligible \n     for any leave from the new employer.\n       Under the CAA, however, the employee remains eligible \n     notwithstanding the transfer to a new employing office. \n     Therefore, if the new employing office were not able to count \n     any FMLA leave taken in the preceding months against the \n     employee's entitlement, a covered employee could gain \n     multiple FMLA leave periods, in excess of the entitlement \n     under the FMLA, simply by repeatedly transferring from one \n     employing office to another. Accordingly, the Board believes \n     that good cause exists to clarify section 825.208 so that \n     leave designated as FMLA leave by one employing office may be \n     counted against the leave entitlement by other employing \n     offices.\n       9. Definition of ``employer''. The definition of \n     ``employer'' under the FMLA is different and far more varied \n     than the definition of ``employer'' that applies under \n     section 202 of the CAA. Therefore, several provisions in 29 \n     C.F.R. part 825 that define who is an ``employer'' have been \n     omitted. These include Sec. 825.104(a)-(b) (persons engaged \n     in or affecting commerce), Sec. 825.104.(c)(1) and (d) \n     (regarding corporations and persons acting for employers), \n     Sec. 825.108 (regarding ``public agencies''), Sec. 825.109 \n     (regarding Federal agencies). References to ``public \n     agencies'', e.g., in section Sec. 825.209(a), and first part \n     of Sec. 825.207(i) (which addresses compensatory time off for \n     State and local employees), were also omitted.\n       10. Business/financial terms. Part 825 of the Secretary's \n     regulations contain a number of references to business-\n     related concepts--e.g., ``profit sharing'', ``business'', \n     ``firm'', ``plant'', ``company,'' ``stock option'', ``profit \n     sharing'', etc. These terms were omitted and, if the context \n     so required, were sometimes replaced with appropriate \n     corresponding terms such as ``employing office''.\n       11. Persons other than covered employees and employing \n     offices. Section 202(a) of the CAA extends rights and \n     protections only to covered employees. Therefore, certain \n     provisions of the Secretary's regulations that would extend \n     beyond these categories, have been omitted. For example, \n     provisions that protect employees of contractors \n     (Sec. 825.216(b)) and employees of temporary agencies and \n     leasing agencies (Sec. 825.106) have been omitted because \n     such employees cannot be ``covered employees'' as that term \n     is defined in the CAA.\n       Furthermore, section 105 of the FMLA, which prohibits \n     interference with FMLA rights and interference with FMLA \n     proceedings and inquiries, extends rights to persons who are \n     not employees and extends prohibitions to persons who are not \n     employers. The Secretary's regulations, at Sec. 825.220, do \n     likewise. To be consistent with the CAA, however, the \n     proposed regulations have been modified to extend rights and \n     protections only to covered employees, and to extend \n     prohibitions only to employing offices.\n       12. Pre-existing collective bargaining agreements. Two \n     provisions of the Secretary's regulations refer to collective \n     bargaining agreements existing before the effective date of \n     the FMLA. Sections 825.102(b), 825.700(c). Because collective \n     bargaining agreements do not now exist within employing \n     offices that are subject to these proposed regulations, these \n     provisions have been omitted.\n       13. Determinations as to who is a health care provider. \n     Section 101(6) of the FMLA defines ``health care provider'' \n     as including, in addition to certain authorized doctors, \n     ``Any other person determined by the Secretary to be capable \n     of providing health care services.'' This same requirement is \n     incorporated into the Secretary's regulations as section \n     825.118(a). The Board does not believe that this provision \n     for determinations by the Secretary should be adopted under \n     the CAA, because this provision would authorize enforcement \n     by the executive branch, which is not authorized under \n     section 225(f)(3) of the CAA. The Board therefore proposes to \n     modify this regulation to authorize the Office of Compliance \n     to certify health care professionals. However, the regulation \n     would require the Office to follow any decisions by the \n     Secretary granted to persons other than covered employees, \n     absent good cause for the Office to conclude otherwise.\n       14. Enforcement procedures. Subpart D of the Secretary's \n     regulations describes the enforcement mechanisms available \n     under the FMLA. This has been replaced with a brief summary \n     and cross-reference to the claims procedures available under \n     the CAA.\n       15. Effect on other applicable law. Section 825.702 \n     provides the Secretary's views about the interaction between \n     FMLA and other applicable law. Because the nature of these \n     laws' application, if any, under the CAA is not the same as \n     their application discussed by the Secretary, certain \n     language has been omitted from the section.\n       16. Definitions. In section 825.800, consistent with the \n     changes discussed above, several definitions were omitted as \n     inapplicable--e.g., Administrator, COBRA, Commerce, Person, \n     Public Agency, State. Two were added--CAA and covered \n     employee. And several were modified, including: eligible \n     employee, employee, and employer.\n\n           D. Topics and organization of proposed regulations\n\n       The regulations being proposed in this notice are organized \n     into subparts and sections that correspond to the subparts \n     and sections promulgated by the Secretary at 29 C.F.R. Part \n     825. These regulations are divided into eight subparts:\n       Subpart A describes what the FMLA is and sets forth to whom \n     it applies under the CAA.\n       Subpart B states what leave an employee is entitled to take \n     under the FMLA as made applicable by the CAA.\n       Subpart C sets forth notice requirements, and states what \n     information an employing office may require of an employee.\n       Subpart D refers to applicable enforcement mechanisms.\n       Subpart E is reserved.\n       Subpart F establishes special rules that apply to employees \n     of schools.\n       Subpart G sets forth how other laws, employing office \n     practices, and collective bargaining agreements affect \n     employee rights under FMLA as made applicable by the CAA.\n       Subpart H sets forth applicable definitions.\n       Appendices included in the proposed regulations also \n     provide certain forms and prototype notices.\n\n                         E. Method of approval\n\n       The Board recommends that (1) the version of the proposed \n     regulations that shall apply to the Senate and employees of \n     the Senate be approved by the Senate by resolution; (2) the \n     version of the proposed regulations that shall apply to the \n     House of Representatives and employees of the House of \n     Representatives be approved by the House of Representatives \n     by resolution; and (3) the version of the proposed \n     regulations that shall apply to other covered employees and \n     employing offices be approved by the Congress by concurrent \n     resolution.\n       Signed at Washington, D.C. on this 21st day of November, \n     1995.\n\n                                                Glen D. Nager,\n\n                                               Chair of the Board,\n                                             Office of Compliance.\n\n     Sec. 825.1 Purpose and scope\n\n       (a) Section 202 of the Congressional Accountability Act \n     (CAA), 2 U.S.C. Sec. 1312, applies the rights and protections \n     of sections 101 through 105 of the Family and Medical Leave \n     Act of 1993 (FMLA), 29 U.S.C. 2611-2615, to certain employees \n     of the legislative branch.\n       (b) This part 825 contains substantive regulations that the \n     Board of Directors of the Office of Compliance has adopted \n     pursuant to \n\n[[Page S 17633]]\n     section 202 of the CAA. Section 202 provides that these substantive \n     regulations should generally be the same as the substantive \n     regulations promulgated by the Secretary of Labor to \n     implement sections 101 through 105 of the FMLA. (The CAA \n     allows these regulations to differ from the regulations \n     promulgated by the Secretary only insofar as the Board may \n     determine, for good cause shown, that a modification of such \n     regulations would be more effective for the implementation of \n     the rights and protections under section 202 of the CAA.) The \n     regulations promulgated by the Secretary to implement the \n     FMLA are found at 29 C.F.R. Part 825.\n       (c) Under the CAA, the Board issues three separate bodies \n     of regulations to implement the FMLA as made applicable by \n     the CAA--one applying to the Senate and its employees, one \n     applying to the House of Representatives and its employees, \n     and one applying to other covered employees and employing \n     offices. This part 825 applies to [ 1 the Senate and \n     employees of the Senate/the House of Representatives and \n     employees of the House of Representatives/the following \n     employing offices and their employees: (1) the Capitol Guide \n     Service, (2) the Capitol Police, (3) the Congressional Budget \n     Office, (4) the Office of the Architect of the Capitol, (5) \n     the Office of the Attending Physician, (6) the Office of \n     Compliance, and (7) the Office of Technology Assessment].\n     \\1\\ This bracketed language contains three versions of \n     regulatory language separated by slashes: the version for the \n     Senate and its employees, the version for the House of \n     Representatives and its employees, and the version for \n     Congressional instrumentalities and their employees, \n     respectively.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n Subpart A--What is the Family and Medical Leave Act, and to Whom Does \n          it Apply under the Congressional Accountability Act?\n\n     Sec. 825.100 What is the Family and Medical Leave Act?\n\n       (a) The Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993 (FMLA), as \n     made applicable by the Congressional Accountability Act \n     (CAA), allows ``eligible'' employees of an employing office \n     to take job-protected, unpaid leave, or to substitute \n     appropriate paid leave if the employee has earned or accrued \n     it, for up to a total of 12 workweeks in any 12 months \n     because of the birth of a child and to care for the newborn \n     child, because of the placement of a child with the employee \n     for adoption or foster care, because the employee is needed \n     to care for a family member (child, spouse, or parent) with a \n     serious health condition, or because the employee's own \n     serious health condition makes the employee unable to perform \n     the functions of his or her job (see Sec. 825.306(b)(4)). In \n     certain cases, this leave may be taken on an intermittent \n     basis rather than all at once, or the employee may work a \n     part-time schedule.\n       (b) An employee on FMLA leave is also entitled to have \n     health benefits maintained while on leave as if the employee \n     had continued to work instead of taking the leave. If an \n     employee was paying all or part of the premium payments prior \n     to leave, the employee would continue to pay his or her share \n     during the leave period. The employing office or a disbursing \n     or other financial office of the House of Representatives or \n     the Senate may recover its share only if the employee does \n     not return to work for a reason other than the serious health \n     condition of the employee or the employee's immediate family \n     member, or another reason beyond the employee's control.\n       (c) An employee generally has a right to return to the same \n     position or an equivalent position with equivalent pay, \n     benefits and working conditions at the conclusion of the \n     leave. The taking of FMLA leave cannot result in the loss of \n     any benefit that accrued prior to the start of the leave.\n       (d) The employing office has a right to 30 days advance \n     notice from the employee where practicable. In addition, the \n     employing office may require an employee to submit \n     certification from a health care provider to substantiate \n     that the leave is due to the serious health condition of the \n     employee or the employee's immediate family member. Failure \n     to comply with these requirements may result in a delay in \n     the start of FMLA leave. Pursuant to a uniformly applied \n     policy, the employing office may also require that an \n     employee present a certification of fitness to return to work \n     when the absence was caused by the employee's serious health \n     condition (see Sec. 825.311(c)). The employing office may \n     delay restoring the employee to employment without such \n     certificate relating to the health condition which caused the \n     employee's absence.\n\n     Sec. 825.101 What is the purpose of the FMLA?\n\n       (a) FMLA is intended to allow employees to balance their \n     work and family life by taking reasonable unpaid leave for \n     medical reasons, for the birth or adoption of a child, and \n     for the care of a child, spouse, or parent who has a serious \n     health condition. The FMLA is intended to balance the demands \n     of the workplace with the needs of families, to promote the \n     stability and economic security of families, and to promote \n     national interests in preserving family integrity. It was \n     intended that the FMLA accomplish these purposes in a manner \n     that accommodates the legitimate interests of employers, and \n     in a manner consistent with the Equal Protection Clause of \n     the Fourteenth Amendment in minimizing the potential for \n     employment discrimination on the basis of sex, while \n     promoting equal employment opportunity for men and women.\n       (b) The enactment of FMLA was predicated on two fundamental \n     concerns--the needs of the American workforce, and the \n     development of high-performance organizations. Increasingly, \n     America's children and elderly are dependent upon family \n     members who must spend long hours at work. When a family \n     emergency arises, requiring workers to attend to seriously-\n     ill children or parents, or to newly-born or adopted infants, \n     or even to their own serious illness, workers need \n     reassurance that they will not be asked to choose between \n     continuing their employment, and meeting their personal and \n     family obligations or tending to vital needs at home.\n       (c) The FMLA is both intended and expected to benefit \n     employers as well as their employees. A direct correlation \n     exists between stability in the family and productivity in \n     the workplace. FMLA will encourage the development of high-\n     performance organizations. When workers can count on durable \n     links to their workplace they are able to make their own full \n     commitments to their jobs. The record of hearings on family \n     and medical leave indicate the powerful productive advantages \n     of stable workplace relationships, and the comparatively \n     small costs of guaranteeing that those relationships will not \n     be dissolved while workers attend to pressing family health \n     obligations or their own serious illness.\n\n     Sec. 825.102 When are the FMLA and the CAA effective for the \n       Senate and its employees?\n\n       (a) The rights and protection of sections 101 through 105 \n     of the FMLA have applied to certain Senate employees and \n     certain employing offices of the Senate since August 5, 1993 \n     (see section 501 of FMLA). The provisions of the CAA that \n     apply the rights and protections of the FMLA will become \n     effective on January 23, 1996.\n\n     Sec. 825.102 When are the FMLA and the CAA effective for the \n       House of Representatives and its employees?\n\n       (a) The rights and protection of sections 101 through 105 \n     of the FMLA have applied to any employee in an employment \n     position and any employment authority of the House of \n     Representatives since August 5, 1993 (see section 502 of \n     FMLA). The provisions of the CAA that apply the rights and \n     protections of the FMLA will become effective for the House \n     of Representatives and its employees on January 23, 1996.\n\n     Sec. 825.102 When are the FMLA and the CAA effective for the \n       employing offices covered by these regulations and their \n       employees?\n\n       (a) The rights and protections of sections 101 through 105 \n     of the FMLA already apply to certain employing offices \n     covered by these regulations and certain employees of these \n     employing offices (see, e.g., Title V of the FMLA, sections \n     501 and 502). The provisions of the CAA that apply the rights \n     and protections of the FMLA to the employing offices covered \n     by these regulations and their employees will become \n     effective on January 23, 1996.]\n       (b) The period prior to the effective date of the \n     application of FMLA rights and protections under the CAA must \n     be considered in determining employee eligibility.\n\n     Sec. 825.103 How does the FMLA, as made applicable by the \n       CAA, affect leave in progress on, or taken before, the \n       effective date of the CAA?\n\n       (a) An eligible employee's right to take FMLA leave began \n     on the date that the rights and protections of the FMLA first \n     went into effect for the employing office and employee (see \n     Sec. 825.102(a)). Any leave taken prior to the date on which \n     the rights and protections of the FMLA first became effective \n     for the employing office from which the leave was taken may \n     not be counted for purposes of the FMLA as made applicable by \n     the CAA. If leave qualifying as FMLA leave was underway prior \n     to the effective date of the FMLA for the employing office \n     from which the leave was taken and continued after the FMLA's \n     effective date for that office, only that portion of leave \n     taken on or after the FMLA's effective date may be counted \n     against the employee's leave entitlement under the FMLA, as \n     made applicable by the CAA.\n       (b) If an employing office-approved leave is underway when \n     the application of the FMLA by the CAA takes effect, no \n     further notice would be required of the employee unless the \n     employee requests an extension of the leave. For leave which \n     commenced on the effective date or shortly thereafter, such \n     notice must have been given which was practicable, \n     considering the foreseeability of the need for leave and the \n     effective date.\n       (c) Starting on January 23, 1996, an employee is entitled \n     to FMLA leave under these regulations if the reason for the \n     leave is qualifying under the FMLA, as made applicable by the \n     CAA, even if the event occasioning the need for leave (e.g., \n     the birth of a child) occurred before such date (so long as \n     any other requirements are satisfied).\n\n     Sec. 825.104 What employing offices are covered by these \n       regulations?\n\n       (a) As used in the CAA, the term ``employing office'' \n     means--\n       (1) the personal office of a Member of the House of \n     Representatives or of a Senator;\n       (2) a committee of the House of Representatives or the \n     Senate or a joint committee;\n       (3) any other office headed by a person with the final \n     authority to appoint, hire, discharge, and set the terms, \n     conditions, or privileges of the employment of an employee of \n     the House of Representatives or the Senate; or\n\n[[Page S 17634]]\n\n       (4) the Capitol Guide Board, the Capitol Police Board, the \n     Congressional Budget Office, the Office of the Attending \n     Physician, the Office of Compliance, and the Office of \n     Technology Assessment.\n       (b) The employing offices covered by the regulations in \n     this part are:\n       [(1) the personal office of any Senator,\n       (2) any committee of the Senate, and\n       (3) any joint committee that employs any employee of the \n     Senate.\n       (1) the personal office of any Member of the House of \n     Representatives,\n       (2) any committee of the House of Representatives, and\n       (3) any joint committee that employs any employee of the \n     House of Representatives.\n       the offices listed in paragraph (a)(4) of this section.]\n       (c) Separate entities will be deemed to be parts of a \n     single employer for purposes of the FMLA, as made applicable \n     by the CAA, if they meet the ``integrated employer'' test. A \n     determination of whether or not separate entities are an \n     integrated employer is not determined by the application of \n     any single criterion, but rather the entire relationship is \n     to be reviewed in its totality. Factors considered in \n     determining whether two or more entities are an integrated \n     employer include: (i) Common management; (ii) Interrelation \n     between operations; (iii) Centralized control of labor \n     relations; and (iv) Degree of common financial control.\n\n     Sec. 825.105 [Reserved.]\n\n     Sec. 825.106 How is ``joint employment'' treated under the \n       FMLA as made applicable by the CAA?\n\n       (a) Where two or more employing offices exercise some \n     control over the work or working conditions of the employee, \n     the employing offices may be joint employers under FMLA, as \n     made applicable by the CAA. Where the employee performs work \n     which simultaneously benefits two or more employing offices, \n     or works for two or more employing offices at different times \n     during the workweek, a joint employment relationship \n     generally will be considered to exist in situations such as:\n       (1) Where there is an arrangement between employing offices \n     to share an employee's services or to interchange employees;\n       (2) Where one employing office acts directly or indirectly \n     in the interest of the other employing office in relation to \n     the employee; or\n       (3) Where the employing offices are not completely \n     disassociated with respect to the employee's employment and \n     may be deemed to share control of the employee, directly or \n     indirectly, because one employing office controls, is \n     controlled by, or is under common control with the other \n     employing office.\n       (b) A determination of whether or not a joint employment \n     relationship exists is not determined by the application of \n     any single criterion, but rather the entire relationship is \n     to be viewed in its totality. For example, joint employment \n     will ordinarily be found to exist when:\n       (1) an employee, who is employed by an employing office \n     other than the personal office of a Member of the House of \n     Representatives or of a Senator, is under the actual \n     direction and control of the Member of the House of \n     Representatives or Senator;\n       (2) two or more employing offices employ an individual to \n     work on common issues or other matters for both or all of \n     them; or\n       (3) an employing office supplies an employee on detail to \n     another employing office.\n       (c)(1) In joint employment relationships, only the \n     employing office that is the primary employer, if any, is \n     responsible for giving required notices to its employees, \n     providing FMLA leave, and maintenance of health benefits. \n     Factors considered in determining which employing office is \n     the ``primary'' employer include authority/responsibility to \n     hire and fire, assign/place the employee, make payroll, and \n     provide employment benefits.\n       (2) When an employee is jointly employed by more than one \n     employing office, the employing offices may fulfill their \n     responsibilities under the FMLA, as made applicable by the \n     CAA, by arranging for these responsibilities to be performed \n     by any one employing office or by a centralized payroll \n     office. However, any such arrangement does not reduce any \n     responsibilities of any of the employing offices if any of \n     their responsibilities under the FMLA as made applicable by \n     the CAA is not fulfilled.\n       (d) [Reserved.]\n       (e) Job restoration is the primary responsibility of the \n     employing office that is the primary employer. The employing \n     office that is the secondary employer is, however, \n     responsible for accepting the employee returning from FMLA \n     leave. An employing office that is the secondary employer is \n     also responsible for compliance with the prohibited acts \n     provisions with respect to its employees. The prohibited acts \n     include prohibitions against interfering with an employee's \n     attempt to exercise rights under the FMLA as made applicable \n     by the CAA, or discharging or discriminating against an \n     employee for opposing a practice which is unlawful under \n     FMLA. An employing office that is the secondary employer will \n     be responsible for compliance with all of the provisions of \n     the FMLA, as made applicable by the CAA, with respect to its \n     regular, permanent workforce.\n\n     Sec. 825.107 [Reserved.]\n\n     Sec. 825.108 [Reserved.]\n\n     Sec. 825.109 [Reserved.]\n\n     Sec. 825.110 Which employees are ``eligible'' to take FMLA \n       leave under these regulations?\n\n       (a) An employee [of the Senate / of the House of \n     Representatives / described in Sec. 825.1(c)] is an \n     ``eligible employee'' under these regulations if the employee \n     has been employed in any employing office for 12 months and \n     for at least 1,250 hours of employment during the previous 12 \n     months.\n       (b) The 12 months an employee must have been employed by \n     any employing office need not be consecutive months. If an \n     employee worked for two or more employing offices \n     sequentially, the time worked will be aggregated to determine \n     whether it equals 12 months. If an employee is maintained on \n     the payroll for any part of a week, including any periods of \n     paid or unpaid leave (sick, vacation) during which other \n     benefits or compensation are provided by the employer (e.g., \n     workers' compensation, group health plan benefits, etc.), the \n     week counts as a week of employment. For purposes of \n     determining whether intermittent/occasional/casual employment \n     qualifies as ``at least 12 months,'' 52 weeks is deemed to be \n     equal to 12 months.\n       (c) If an employee was employed by two or more employing \n     offices, either sequentially or concurrently, the hours of \n     service will be aggregated to determine whether the minimum \n     of 1,250 hours has been reached. Whether an employee has \n     worked the minimum 1,250 hours of service is determined \n     according to the principles established under the Fair Labor \n     Standards Act (FLSA) for determining compensable hours of \n     work (see 29 C.F.R. Part 785). The determining factor is the \n     number of hours an employee has worked for one or more \n     employing offices. The determination is not limited by \n     methods of record-keeping, or by compensation agreements that \n     do not accurately reflect all of the hours an employee has \n     worked for or been in service to the employing office. Any \n     accurate accounting of actual hours worked may be used. For \n     this purpose, full-time teachers (see Sec. 825.800 for \n     definition) of an elementary or secondary school system, or \n     institution of higher education, or other educational \n     establishment or institution are deemed to meet the 1,250 \n     hour test. An employing office must be able to clearly \n     demonstrate that such an employee did not work 1,250 hours \n     during the previous 12 months in order to claim that the \n     employee is not ``eligible'' for FMLA leave.\n       (d) The determinations of whether an employee has worked \n     for any employing office for at least 1,250 hours in the past \n     12 months and has been employed by any employing office for a \n     total of at least 12 months must be made as of the date leave \n     commences. If an employee notifies the employing office of \n     need for FMLA leave before the employee meets these \n     eligibility criteria, the employing office must either \n     confirm the employee's eligibility based upon a projection \n     that the employee will be eligible on the date leave would \n     commence or must advise the employee when the eligibility \n     requirement is met. If the employing office confirms \n     eligibility at the time the notice for leave is received, the \n     employing office may not subsequently challenge the \n     employee's eligibility. In the latter case, if the employing \n     office does not advise the employee whether the employee is \n     eligible as soon as practicable (i.e., two business days \n     absent extenuating circumstances) after the date employee \n     eligibility is determined, the employee will have satisfied \n     the notice requirements and the notice of leave is considered \n     current and outstanding until the employing office does \n     advise. If the employing office fails to advise the employee \n     whether the employee is eligible prior to the date the \n     requested leave is to commence, the employee will be deemed \n     eligible. The employing office may not, then, deny the leave. \n     Where the employee does not give notice of the need for leave \n     more than two business days prior to commencing leave, the \n     employee will be deemed to be eligible if the employing \n     office fails to advise the employee that the employee is not \n     eligible within two business days of receiving the employee's \n     notice.\n       (e) The period prior to the effective date of the \n     application of FMLA rights and protections under the CAA must \n     be considered in determining employee's eligibility.\n       (f) [Reserved.]\n\n     Sec. 825.111 [Reserved.]\n\n     Sec. 825.112 Under what kinds of circumstances are employing \n       offices required to grant family or medical leave?\n\n       (a) Employing offices are required to grant leave to \n     eligible employees:\n       (1) For birth of a son or daughter, and to care for the \n     newborn child;\n       (2) For placement with the employee of a son or daughter \n     for adoption or foster care;\n       (3) To care for the employee's spouse, son, daughter, or \n     parent with a serious health condition; and\n       (4) Because of a serious health condition that makes the \n     employee unable to perform the functions of the employee's \n     job.\n       (b) The right to take leave under FMLA as made applicable \n     by the CAA applies equally to male and female employees. A \n     father, as well as a mother, can take family leave for the \n     birth, placement for adoption or foster care of a child.\n       (c) Circumstances may require that FMLA leave begin before \n     the actual date of birth of a child. An expectant mother may \n     take FMLA leave pursuant to paragraph (a)(4) of this section \n     before the birth of the child for prenatal care or if her \n     condition makes her unable to work.\n       (d) Employing offices are required to grant FMLA leave \n     pursuant to paragraph (a)(2) of \n\n[[Page S 17635]]\n     this section before the actual placement or adoption of a child if an \n     absence from work is required for the placement for adoption \n     or foster care to proceed. For example, the employee may be \n     required to attend counseling sessions, appear in court, \n     consult with his or her attorney or the doctor(s) \n     representing the birth parent, or submit to a physical \n     examination. The source of an adopted child (e.g., whether \n     from a licensed placement agency or otherwise) is not a \n     factor in determining eligibility for leave for this purpose.\n       (e) Foster care is 24-hour care for children in \n     substitution for, and away from, their parents or guardian. \n     Such placement is made by or with the agreement of the State \n     as a result of a voluntary agreement between the parent or \n     guardian that the child be removed from the home, or pursuant \n     to a judicial determination of the necessity for foster care, \n     and involves agreement between the State and foster family \n     that the foster family will take care of the child. Although \n     foster care may be with relatives of the child, State action \n     is involved in the removal of the child from parental \n     custody.\n       (f) In situations where the employer/employee relationship \n     has been interrupted, such as an employee who has been on \n     layoff, the employee must be recalled or otherwise be re-\n     employed before being eligible for FMLA leave. Under such \n     circumstances, an eligible employee is immediately entitled \n     to further FMLA leave for a qualifying reason.\n       (g) FMLA leave is available for treatment for substance \n     abuse provided the conditions of Sec. 825.114 are met. \n     However, treatment for substance abuse does not prevent an \n     employing office from taking employment action against an \n     employee. The employing office may not take action against \n     the employee because the employee has exercised his or her \n     right to take FMLA leave for treatment. However, if the \n     employing office has an established policy, applied in a non-\n     discriminatory manner that has been communicated to all \n     employees, that provides under certain circumstances an \n     employee may be terminated for substance abuse, pursuant to \n     that policy the employee may be terminated whether or not the \n     employee is presently taking FMLA leave. An employee may also \n     take FMLA leave to care for an immediate family member who is \n     receiving treatment for substance abuse. The employing office \n     may not take action against an employee who is providing care \n     for an immediate family member receiving treatment for \n     substance abuse.\n\n     Sec. 825.113 What do ``spouse,'' ``parent,'' and ``son or \n       daughter'' mean for purposes of an employee qualifying to \n       take FMLA leave?\n\n       (a) Spouse means a husband or wife as defined or recognized \n     under State law for purposes of marriage in the State where \n     the employee resides, including common law marriage in States \n     where it is recognized.\n       (b) Parent means a biological parent or an individual who \n     stands or stood in loco parentis to an employee when the \n     employee was a son or daughter as defined in (c) below. This \n     term does not include parents ``in law''.\n       (c) Son or daughter means a biological, adopted, or foster \n     child, a stepchild, a legal ward, or a child of a person \n     standing in loco parentis, who is either under age 18, or age \n     18 or older and ``incapable of self-care because of a mental \n     or physical disability.''\n       (1) ``Incapable of self-care'' means that the individual \n     requires active assistance or supervision to provide daily \n     self-care in three or more of the ``activities of daily \n     living'' (ADLs) or ``instrumental activities of daily \n     living'' (IADLs). Activities of daily living include adaptive \n     activities such as caring appropriately for one's grooming \n     and hygiene, bathing, dressing and eating. Instrumental \n     activities of daily living include cooking, cleaning, \n     shopping, taking public transportation, paying bills, \n     maintaining a residence, using telephones and directories, \n     using a post office, etc.\n       (2) ``Physical or mental disability'' means a physical or \n     mental impairment that substantially limits one or more of \n     the major life activities of an individual. Regulations at 29 \n     C.F.R. Sec. 1630.2(h), (i), and (j), issued by the Equal \n     Employment Opportunity Commission under the Americans with \n     Disabilities Act (ADA), 42 U.S.C. 12101 et seq. define these \n     terms.\n       (3) Persons who are ``in loco parentis'' include those with \n     day-to-day responsibilities to care for and financially \n     support a child or, in the case of an employee, who had such \n     responsibility for the employee when the employee was a \n     child. A biological or legal relationship is not necessary.\n       (d) For purposes of confirmation of family relationship, \n     the employing office may require the employee giving notice \n     of the need for leave to provide reasonable documentation or \n     statement of family relationship. This documentation may take \n     the form of a simple statement from the employee, or a \n     child's birth certificate, a court document, etc. The \n     employing office is entitled to examine documentation such as \n     a birth certificate, etc., but the employee is entitled to \n     the return of the official document submitted for this \n     purpose.\n\n     Sec. 825.114 What is a ``serious health condition'' entitling \n       an employee to FMLA leave?\n\n       (a) For purposes of FMLA, ``serious health condition'' \n     entitling an employee to FMLA leave means an illness, injury, \n     impairment, or physical or mental condition that involves:\n       (1) Inpatient care (i.e., an overnight stay) in a hospital, \n     hospice, or residential medical care facility, including any \n     period of incapacity (for purposes of this section, defined \n     to mean inability to work, attend school or perform other \n     regular daily activities due to the serious health condition, \n     treatment therefor, or recovery therefrom), or any subsequent \n     treatment in connection with such inpatient care; or\n       (2) Continuing treatment by a health care provider. A \n     serious health condition involving continuing treatment by a \n     health care provider includes any one or more of the \n     following:\n       (i) A period of incapacity (i.e., inability to work, attend \n     school or perform other regular daily activities due to the \n     serious health condition, treatment therefor, or recovery \n     therefrom) of more than three consecutive calendar days, and \n     any subsequent treatment or period of incapacity relating to \n     the same condition, that also involves:\n       (A) Treatment two or more times by a health care provider, \n     by a nurse or physician's assistant under direct supervision \n     of a health care provider, or by a provider of health care \n     services (e.g., physical therapist) under orders of, or on \n     referral by, a health care provider; or\n       (B) Treatment by a health care provider on at least one \n     occasion which results in a regimen of continuing treatment \n     under the supervision of the health care provider.\n       (ii) Any period of incapacity due to pregnancy, or for \n     prenatal care.\n       (iii) Any period of incapacity or treatment for such \n     incapacity due to a chronic serious health condition. A \n     chronic serious health condition is one which:\n       (A) Requires periodic visits for treatment by a health care \n     provider, or by a nurse or physician's assistant under direct \n     supervision of a health care provider;\n       (B) Continues over an extended period of time (including \n     recurring episodes of a single underlying condition); and\n       (C) May cause episodic rather than a continuing period of \n     incapacity (e.g., asthma, diabetes, epilepsy, etc.).\n       (iv) A period of incapacity which is permanent or long-term \n     due to a condition for which treatment may not be effective. \n     The employee or family member must be under the \n     continuing supervision of, but need not be receiving \n     active treatment by, a health care provider. Examples \n     include Alzheimer's, a severe stroke, or the terminal \n     stages of a disease.\n       (v) Any period of absence to receive multiple treatments \n     (including any period of recovery therefrom) by a health care \n     provider or by a provider of health care services under \n     orders of, or on referral by, a health care provider, either \n     for restorative surgery after an accident or other injury, or \n     for a condition that would likely result in a period of \n     incapacity of more than three consecutive calendar days in \n     the absence of medical intervention or treatment, such as \n     cancer (chemotherapy, radiation, etc.), severe arthritis \n     (physical therapy), kidney disease (dialysis).\n       (b) Treatment for purposes of paragraph (a) of this section \n     includes (but is not limited to) examinations to determine if \n     a serious health condition exists and evaluations of the \n     condition. Treatment does not include routine physical \n     examinations, eye examinations, or dental examinations. Under \n     paragraph (a)(2)(i)(B), a regimen of continuing treatment \n     includes, for example, a course of prescription medication \n     (e.g., an antibiotic) or therapy requiring special equipment \n     to resolve or alleviate the health condition (e.g., oxygen). \n     A regimen of continuing treatment that includes the taking of \n     over-the-counter medications such as aspirin, antihistamines, \n     or salves; or bed-rest, drinking fluids, exercise, and other \n     similar activities that can be initiated without a visit to a \n     health care provider, is not, by itself, sufficient to \n     constitute a regimen of continuing treatment for purposes of \n     FMLA leave.\n       (c) Conditions for which cosmetic treatments are \n     administered (such as most treatments for acne or plastic \n     surgery) are not ``serious health conditions'' unless \n     inpatient hospital care is required or unless complications \n     develop. Ordinarily, unless complications arise, the common \n     cold, the flu, ear aches, upset stomach, minor ulcers, \n     headaches other than migraine, routine dental or orthodontia \n     problems, periodontal disease, etc., are examples of \n     conditions that do not meet the definition of a serious \n     health condition and do not qualify for FMLA leave. \n     Restorative dental or plastic surgery after an injury or \n     removal of cancerous growths are serious health conditions \n     provided all the other conditions of this regulation are met. \n     Mental illness resulting from stress or allergies may be \n     serious health conditions, but only if all the conditions of \n     this section are met.\n       (d) Substance abuse may be a serious health condition if \n     the conditions of this section are met. However, FMLA leave \n     may only be taken for treatment for substance abuse by a \n     health care provider or by a provider of health care services \n     on referral by a health care provider. On the other hand, \n     absence because of the employee's use of the substance, \n     rather than for treatment, does not qualify for FMLA leave.\n       (e) Absences attributable to incapacity under paragraphs \n     (a)(2) (ii) or (iii) qualify for FMLA leave even though the \n     employee or the immediate family member does not receive \n     treatment from a health care provider during the absence, and \n     even if the absence does not last more than three days. For \n     example, an employee with asthma may be unable to report for \n     work due to the onset of an asthma attack or because the \n     employee's \n\n[[Page S 17636]]\n     health care provider has advised the employee to stay home when the \n     pollen count exceeds a certain level. An employee who is \n     pregnant may be unable to report to work because of severe \n     morning sickness.\n\n     Sec. 825.115 What does it mean that ``the employee is unable \n       to perform the functions of the position of the employee''?\n\n       An employee is ``unable to perform the functions of the \n     position'' where the health care provider finds that the \n     employee is unable to work at all or is unable to perform any \n     one of the essential functions of the employee's position \n     within the meaning of the Americans with Disabilities Act \n     (ADA), 42 U.S.C. 12101 et seq., and the regulations at 29 \n     C.F.R. Sec. 1630.2(n)). An employee who must be absent from \n     work to receive medical treatment for a serious health \n     condition is considered to be unable to perform the essential \n     functions of the position during the absence for treatment. \n     An employing office has the option, in requiring \n     certification from a health care provider, to provide a \n     statement of the essential functions of the employee's \n     position for the health care provider to review. For purposes \n     of FMLA, the essential functions of the employee's position \n     are to be determined with reference to the position the \n     employee held at the time notice is given or leave commenced, \n     whichever is earlier.\n\n     Sec. 825.116 What does it mean that an employee is ``needed \n       to care for'' a family member?\n\n       (a) The medical certification provision that an employee is \n     ``needed to care for'' a family member encompasses both \n     physical and psychological care. It includes situations \n     where, for example, because of a serious health condition, \n     the family member is unable to care for his or her own basic \n     medical, hygienic, or nutritional needs or safety, or is \n     unable to transport himself or herself to the doctor, etc. \n     The term also includes providing psychological comfort and \n     reassurance which would be beneficial to a child, spouse or \n     parent with a serious health condition who is receiving \n     inpatient or home care.\n       (b) The term also includes situations where the employee \n     may be needed to fill in for others who are caring for the \n     family member, or to make arrangements for changes in care, \n     such as transfer to a nursing home.\n       (c) An employee's intermittent leave or a reduced leave \n     schedule necessary to care for a family member includes not \n     only a situation where the family member's condition itself \n     is intermittent, but also where the employee is only needed \n     intermittently--such as where other care is normally \n     available, or care responsibilities are shared with another \n     member of the family or a third party.\n\n     Sec. 825.117 For an employee seeking intermittent FMLA leave \n       or leave on a reduced leave schedule, what is meant by \n       ``the medical necessity for'' such leave?\n\n       For intermittent leave or leave on a reduced leave \n     schedule, there must be a medical need for leave (as \n     distinguished from voluntary treatments and procedures) and \n     it must be that such medical need can be best accommodated \n     through an intermittent or reduced leave schedule. The \n     treatment regimen and other information described in the \n     certification of a serious health condition (see \n     Sec. 825.306) meets the requirement for certification of the \n     medical necessity of intermittent leave or leave on a reduced \n     leave schedule. Employees needing intermittent FMLA leave or \n     leave on a reduced leave schedule must attempt to schedule \n     their leave so as not to disrupt the employing office's \n     operations. In addition, an employing office may assign an \n     employee to an alternative position with equivalent pay \n     and benefits that better accommodates the employee's \n     intermittent or reduced leave schedule.\n\n     Sec. 825.118 What is a ``health care provider''?\n\n       (a)(1) The term ``health care provider'' means:\n       (i) A doctor of medicine or osteopathy who is authorized to \n     practice medicine or surgery (as appropriate) by the State in \n     which the doctor practices; or\n       (ii) Any other person determined by the Office of \n     Compliance to be capable of providing health care services.\n       (2) In making a determination referred to in subparagraph \n     (1)(ii), and absent good cause shown to do otherwise, the \n     Office of Compliance will follow any determination made by \n     the Secretary of Labor (under section 101(6)(B) of the FMLA) \n     that a person is capable of providing health care services, \n     provided the Secretary's determination was not made at the \n     request of a person who was then a covered employee.\n       (b) Others ``capable of providing health care services'' \n     include only:\n       (1) Podiatrists, dentists, clinical psychologists, \n     optometrists, and chiropractors (limited to treatment \n     consisting of manual manipulation of the spine to correct a \n     subluxation as demonstrated by X-ray to exist) authorized to \n     practice in the State and performing within the scope of \n     their practice as defined under State law;\n       (2) Nurse practitioners, nurse-midwives and clinical social \n     workers who are authorized to practice under State law and \n     who are performing within the scope of their practice as \n     defined under State law;\n       (3) Christian Science practitioners listed with the First \n     Church of Christ, Scientist in Boston, Massachusetts. Where \n     an employee or family member is receiving treatment from a \n     Christian Science practitioner, an employee may not object to \n     any requirement from an employing office that the employee or \n     family member submit to examination (though not treatment) to \n     obtain a second or third certification from a health care \n     provider other than a Christian Science practitioner except \n     as otherwise provided under applicable State or local law or \n     collective bargaining agreement.\n       (4) Any health care provider from whom an employing office \n     or the employing office's group health plan's benefits \n     manager will accept certification of the existence of a \n     serious health condition to substantiate a claim for \n     benefits; and\n       (5) A health care provider listed above who practices in a \n     country other than the United States, who is authorized to \n     practice in accordance with the law of that country, and who \n     is performing within the scope of his or her practice as \n     defined under such law.\n       (c) The phrase ``authorized to practice in the State'' as \n     used in this section means that the provider must be \n     authorized to diagnose and treat physical or mental health \n     conditions without supervision by a doctor or other health \n     care provider.\n\n\nsubpart b--what leave is an employee entitled to take under the family \n    and medical leave act, as made applicable by the congressional \n                          accountability act?\n\n     Sec. 825.200 How much leave may an employee take?\n\n       (a) An eligible employee's FMLA leave entitlement is \n     limited to a total of 12 workweeks of leave during any 12-\n     month period for any one, or more, of the following reasons:\n       (1) The birth of the employee's son or daughter, and to \n     care for the newborn child;\n       (2) The placement with the employee of a son or daughter \n     for adoption or foster care, and to care for the newly placed \n     child;\n       (3) To care for the employee's spouse, son, daughter, or \n     parent with a serious health condition; and,\n       (4) Because of a serious health condition that makes the \n     employee unable to perform one or more of the essential \n     functions of his or her job.\n       (b) An employing office is permitted to choose any one of \n     the following methods for determining the ``12-month period'' \n     in which the 12 weeks of leave entitlement occurs:\n       (1) The calendar year;\n       (2) Any fixed 12-month ``leave year,'' such as a fiscal \n     year, a year required by State law, or a year starting on an \n     employee's ``anniversary'' date;\n       (3) The 12-month period measured forward from the date any \n     employee's first FMLA leave begins; or,\n       (c) Under methods in paragraphs (b)(1) and (b)(2) of this \n     section an employee would be entitled to up to 12 weeks of \n     FMLA leave at any time in the fixed 12-month period selected. \n     An employee could, therefore, take 12 weeks of leave at the \n     end of the year and 12 weeks at the beginning of the \n     following year. Under the method in paragraph (b)(3) of this \n     section, an employee would be entitled to 12 weeks of leave \n     during the year beginning on the first date FMLA leave is \n     taken; the next 12-month period would begin the first time \n     FMLA leave is taken after completion of any previous 12-month \n     period. Under the method in paragraph (b)(4) of this section, \n     the ``rolling'' 12-month period, each time an employee takes \n     FMLA leave the remaining leave entitlement would be any \n     balance of the 12 weeks which has not been used during the \n     immediately preceding 12 months. For example, if an employee \n     has taken eight weeks of leave during the past 12 months, an \n     additional four weeks of leave could be taken. If an employee \n     used four weeks beginning February 1, 1997, four weeks \n     beginning June 1, 1997, and four weeks beginning December 1, \n     1997, the employee would not be entitled to any additional \n     leave until February 1, 1998. However, beginning on February \n     1, 1998, the employee would be entitled to four weeks of \n     leave, on June 1 the employee would be entitled to an \n     additional four weeks, etc.\n       (d)(1) Employing offices will be allowed to choose any one \n     of the alternatives in paragraph (b) of this section provided \n     the alternative chosen is applied consistently and uniformly \n     to all employees. An employing office wishing to change to \n     another alternative is required to give at least 60 days \n     notice to all employees, and the transition must take place \n     in such a way that the employees retain the full benefit of \n     12 weeks of leave under whichever method affords the greatest \n     benefit to the employee. Under no circumstances may a new \n     method be implemented in order to avoid the CAA's FMLA \n     leave requirements.\n       (2) [Reserved.]\n       (e) If an employing office fails to select one of the \n     options in paragraph (b) of this section for measuring the \n     12-month period, the option that provides the most beneficial \n     outcome for the employee will be used. The employing office \n     may subsequently select an option only by providing the 60-\n     day notice to all employees of the option the employing \n     office intends to implement. During the running of the 60-day \n     period any other employee who needs FMLA leave may use the \n     option providing the most beneficial outcome to that \n     employee. At the conclusion of the 60-day period the \n     employing office may implement the selected option.\n       (f) For purposes of determining the amount of leave used by \n     an employee, the fact that a holiday may occur within the \n     week taken as FMLA leave has no effect; the week is counted \n     as a week of FMLA leave. However, if for some reason the \n     employing office's activity has temporarily ceased and \n     employees generally are not expected to report for work for \n     one or more weeks (e.g., a school closing \n\n[[Page S 17637]]\n     two weeks for the Christmas/New Year holiday or the summer vacation or \n     an employing office closing the office for repairs), the days \n     the employing office's activities have ceased do not count \n     against the employee's FMLA leave entitlement. Methods for \n     determining an employee's 12-week leave entitlement are also \n     described in Sec. 825.205.\n\n     Sec. 825.201 If leave is taken for the birth of a child, or \n       for placement of a child for adoption or foster care, when \n       must the leave be concluded?\n\n       An employee's entitlement to leave for a birth or placement \n     for adoption or foster care expires at the end of the 12-\n     month period beginning on the date of the birth or placement, \n     unless the employing office permits leave to be taken for a \n     longer period. Any such FMLA leave must be concluded within \n     this one-year period.\n\n     Sec. 825.202 How much leave may a husband and wife take if \n       they are employed by the same employing office?\n\n       (a) A husband and wife who are eligible for FMLA leave and \n     are employed by the same employing office may be limited to a \n     combined total of 12 weeks of leave during any 12-month \n     period if the leave is taken:\n       (1) for birth of the employee's son or daughter or to care \n     for the child after birth;\n       (2) for placement of a son or daughter with the employee \n     for adoption or foster care, or to care for the child after \n     placement; or\n       (3) to care for the employee's parent with a serious health \n     condition.\n       (b) This limitation on the total weeks of leave applies to \n     leave taken for the reasons specified in paragraph (a) of \n     this section as long as a husband and wife are employed by \n     the ``same employing office.'' It would apply, for example, \n     even though the spouses are employed at two different \n     worksites of an employing office. On the other hand, if one \n     spouse is ineligible for FMLA leave, the other spouse would \n     be entitled to a full 12 weeks of FMLA leave.\n       (c) Where the husband and wife both use a portion of the \n     total 12-week FMLA leave entitlement for one of the purposes \n     in paragraph (a) of this section, the husband and wife would \n     each be entitled to the difference between the amount he or \n     she has taken individually and 12 weeks for FMLA leave for a \n     purpose other than those contained in paragraph (a) of this \n     section. For example, if each spouse took 6 weeks of leave to \n     care for a healthy, newborn child, each could use an \n     additional 6 weeks due to his or her own serious health \n     condition or to care for a child with a serious health \n     condition.\n\n     Sec. 825.203 Does FMLA leave have to be taken all at once, or \n       can it be taken in parts?\n\n       (a) FMLA leave may be taken ``intermittently or on a \n     reduced leave schedule'' under certain circumstances. \n     Intermittent leave is FMLA leave taken in separate blocks of \n     time due to a single qualifying reason. A reduced leave \n     schedule is a leave schedule that reduces an employee's usual \n     number of working hours per workweek, or hours per workday. A \n     reduced leave schedule is a change in the employee's schedule \n     for a period of time, normally from full-time to part-time.\n       (b) When leave is taken after the birth or placement of a \n     child for adoption or foster care, an employee may take leave \n     intermittently or on a reduced leave schedule only if the \n     employing office agrees. Such a schedule reduction might \n     occur, for example, where an employee, with the employing \n     office's agreement, works part-time after the birth of a \n     child, or takes leave in several segments. The employing \n     office's agreement is not required, however, for leave during \n     which the mother has a serious health condition in connection \n     with the birth of her child or if the newborn child has a \n     serious health condition.\n       (c) Leave may be taken intermittently or on a reduced leave \n     schedule when medically necessary for planned and/or \n     unanticipated medical treatment of a related serious health \n     condition by or under the supervision of a health care \n     provider, or for recovery from treatment or recovery from a \n     serious health condition. It may also be taken to provide \n     care or psychological comfort to an immediate family member \n     with a serious health condition.\n       (1) Intermittent leave may be taken for a serious health \n     condition which requires treatment by a health care provider \n     periodically, rather than for one continuous period of time, \n     and may include leave of periods from an hour or more to \n     several weeks. Examples of intermittent leave would include \n     leave taken on an occasional basis for medical appointments, \n     or leave taken several days at a time spread over a period of \n     six months, such as for chemotherapy. A pregnant employee may \n     take leave intermittently for prenatal examinations or for \n     her own condition, such as for periods of severe morning \n     sickness. An example of an employee taking leave on a reduced \n     leave schedule is an employee who is recovering from a \n     serious health condition and is not strong enough to work a \n     full-time schedule.\n       (2) Intermittent or reduced schedule leave may be taken for \n     absences where the employee or family member is incapacitated \n     or unable to perform the essential functions of the position \n     because of a chronic serious health condition even if he or \n     she does not receive treatment by a health care provider.\n       (d) There is no limit on the size of an increment of leave \n     when an employee takes intermittent leave or leave on a \n     reduced leave schedule. However, an employing office may \n     limit leave increments to the shortest period of time that \n     the employing office's payroll system uses to account for \n     absences or use of leave, provided it is one hour or less. \n     For example, an employee might take two hours off for a \n     medical appointment, or might work a reduced day of four \n     hours over a period of several weeks while recuperating from \n     an illness. An employee may not be required to take more FMLA \n     leave than necessary to address the circumstance that \n     precipitated the need for the leave, except as provided in \n     Sec. Sec. 825.601 and 825.602.\n\n     Sec. 825.204 May an employing office transfer an employee to \n       an ``alternative position'' in order to accommodate \n       intermittent leave or a reduced leave schedule?\n\n       (a) If an employee needs intermittent leave or leave on a \n     reduced leave schedule that is foreseeable based on planned \n     medical treatment for the employee or a family member, \n     including during a period of recovery from a serious health \n     condition, or if the employing office agrees to permit \n     intermittent or reduced schedule leave for the birth of a \n     child or for placement of a child for adoption or foster \n     care, the employing office may require the employee to \n     transfer temporarily, during the period the intermittent or \n     reduced leave schedule is required, to an available \n     alternative position for which the employee is qualified and \n     which better accommodates recurring periods of leave than \n     does the employee's regular position. See Sec. 825.601 for \n     special rules applicable to instructional employees of \n     schools.\n       (b) Transfer to an alternative position may require \n     compliance with any applicable collective bargaining \n     agreement, and federal law (such as the Americans with \n     Disabilities Act). Transfer to an alternative position may \n     include altering an existing job to better accommodate the \n     employee's need for intermittent or reduced leave.\n       (c) The alternative position must have equivalent pay and \n     benefits. An alternative position for these purposes does not \n     have to have equivalent duties. The employing office may \n     increase the pay and benefits of an existing alternative \n     position, so as to make them equivalent to the pay and \n     benefits of the employee's regular job. The employing office \n     may also transfer the employee to a part-time job with the \n     same hourly rate of pay and benefits, provided the employee \n     is not required to take more leave than is medically \n     necessary. For example, an employee desiring to take leave in \n     increments of four hours per day could be transferred to a \n     half-time job, or could remain in the employee's same job on \n     a part-time schedule, paying the same hourly rate as the \n     employee's previous job and enjoying the same benefits. The \n     employing office may not eliminate benefits which otherwise \n     would not be provided to part-time employees; however, an \n     employing office may proportionately reduce benefits such as \n     vacation leave where an employing office's normal practice is \n     to base such benefits on the number of hours worked.\n       (d) An employing office may not transfer the employee to an \n     alternative position in order to discourage the employee from \n     taking leave or otherwise work a hardship on the employee. \n     For example, a white collar employee may not be assigned to \n     perform laborer's work; an employee working the day shift may \n     not be reassigned to the graveyard shift; an employee working \n     in the headquarters facility may not be reassigned to a \n     branch a significant distance away from the employee's normal \n     job location. Any such attempt on the part of the employing \n     office to make such a transfer will be held to be contrary to \n     the prohibited-acts provisions of the FMLA, as made \n     applicable by the CAA.\n       (e) When an employee who is taking leave intermittently or \n     on a reduced leave schedule and has been transferred to an \n     alternative position no longer needs to continue on leave and \n     is able to return to full-time work, the employee must be \n     placed in the same or equivalent job as the job he/she left \n     when the leave commenced. An employee may not be required to \n     take more leave than necessary to address the circumstance \n     that precipitated the need for leave.\n\n     Sec. 825.205 How does one determine the amount of leave used \n       where an employee takes leave intermittently or on a \n       reduced leave schedule?\n\n       (a) If an employee takes leave on an intermittent or \n     reduced leave schedule, only the amount of leave actually \n     taken may be counted toward the 12 weeks of leave to which an \n     employee is entitled. For example, if an employee who \n     normally works five days a week takes off one day, the \n     employee would use 1/5 of a week of FMLA leave. Similarly, if \n     a full-time employee who normally works 8-hour days works 4-\n     hour days under a reduced leave schedule, the employee would \n     use 1/2 week of FMLA leave each week.\n       (b) Where an employee normally works a part-time schedule \n     or variable hours, the amount of leave to which an employee \n     is entitled is determined on a pro rata or proportional basis \n     by comparing the new schedule with the employee's normal \n     schedule. For example, if an employee who normally works 30 \n     hours per week works only 20 hours a week under a reduced \n     leave schedule, the employee's ten hours of leave would \n     constitute one-third of a week of FMLA leave for each week \n     the employee works the reduced leave schedule.\n       (c) If an employing office has made a permanent or long-\n     term change in the employee's schedule (for reasons other \n     than FMLA, and prior to the notice of need for FMLA \n\n[[Page S 17638]]\n     leave), the hours worked under the new schedule are to be used for \n     making this calculation.\n       (d) If an employee's schedule varies from week to week, a \n     weekly average of the hours worked over the 12 weeks prior to \n     the beginning of the leave period would be used for \n     calculating the employee's normal workweek.\n\n     Sec. 825.206 May an employing office deduct hourly amounts \n       from an employee's salary, when providing unpaid leave \n       under FMLA, as made applicable by the CAA, without \n       affecting the employee's qualification for exemption as an \n       executive, administrative, or professional employee, or \n       when utilizing the fluctuating workweek method for payment \n       of overtime, under the Fair Labor Standards Act?\n\n       (a) Leave taken under FMLA as made applicable by the CAA \n     may be unpaid. If an employee is otherwise exempt from \n     minimum wage and overtime requirements of the Fair Labor \n     Standards Act (FLSA) as a salaried executive, administrative, \n     or professional employee under regulations issued by the \n     Board at [CAA regulations based on 29 CFR Part 541], \n     providing unpaid FMLA-qualifying leave to such an employee \n     will not cause the employee to lose the FLSA exemption. This \n     means that under regulations currently in effect, where an \n     employee meets the specified duties test, is paid on a salary \n     basis, and is paid a salary of at least the amount specified \n     in the regulations, the employing office may make deductions \n     from the employee's salary for any hours taken as \n     intermittent or reduced FMLA leave within a workweek, without \n     affecting the exempt status of the employee. The fact that an \n     employing office provides FMLA leave, whether paid or unpaid, \n     will not be relevant to the determination whether an employee \n     is exempt within the meaning of [CAA regulations based on 29 \n     CFR Part 541].\n       (b) For an employee paid in accordance with the fluctuating \n     workweek method of payment for overtime (see 29 CFR 778.114), \n     the employing office, during the period in which intermittent \n     or reduced schedule FMLA leave is scheduled to be taken, may \n     compensate an employee on an hourly basis and pay only for \n     the hours the employee works, including time and one-half the \n     employee's regular rate for overtime hours. The change to \n     payment on an hourly basis would include the entire period \n     during which the employee is taking intermittent leave, \n     including weeks in which no leave is taken. The hourly rate \n     shall be determined by dividing the employee's weekly salary \n     by the employee's normal or average schedule of hours \n     worked during weeks in which FMLA leave is not being \n     taken. If an employing office chooses to follow this \n     exception from the fluctuating workweek method of payment, \n     the employing office must do so uniformly, with respect to \n     all employees paid on a fluctuating workweek basis for \n     whom FMLA leave is taken on an intermittent or reduced \n     leave schedule basis. If an employing office does not \n     elect to convert the employee's compensation to hourly \n     pay, no deduction may be taken for FMLA leave absences. \n     Once the need for intermittent or reduced scheduled leave \n     is over, the employee may be restored to payment on a \n     fluctuating work week basis.\n       (c) This special exception to the salary basis'' \n     requirements of the FLSA exemption or fluctuating workweek \n     payment requirements applies only to employees of covered \n     employing offices who are eligible for FMLA leave, and to \n     leave which qualifies as (one of the four types of) FMLA \n     leave. Hourly or other deductions which are not in accordance \n     with [CAA regulations based on 29 CFR Part 541] or 29 CFR \n     Sec. 778.114 may not be taken, for example, where the \n     employee has not worked long enough to be eligible for FMLA \n     leave without potentially affecting the employee's \n     eligibility for exemption. Nor may deductions which are not \n     permitted by [CAA regulations based on 29 CFR Part 541] or 29 \n     CFR Sec. 778.114 be taken from such an employee's salary for \n     any leave which does not qualify as FMLA leave, for example, \n     deductions from an employee's pay for leave required under an \n     employing office's policy or practice for a reason which does \n     not qualify as FMLA leave, e.g., leave to care for a \n     grandparent or for a medical condition which does not qualify \n     as a serious health condition; or for leave which is more \n     generous than provided by FMLA as made applicable by the CAA, \n     such as leave in excess of 12 weeks in a year. The employing \n     office may comply with the employing office's own policy/\n     practice under these circumstances and maintain the \n     employee's eligibility for exemption or for the fluctuating \n     workweek method of pay by not taking hourly deductions from \n     the employee's pay, in accordance with FLSA requirements, or \n     may take such deductions, treating the employee as an \n     ``hourly'' employee and pay overtime premium pay for hours \n     worked over 40 in a workweek.\n\n     Sec. 825.207  Is FMLA leave paid or unpaid?\n\n       (a) Generally, FMLA leave is unpaid. However, under the \n     circumstances described in this section, FMLA, as made \n     applicable by the CAA, permits an eligible employee to choose \n     to substitute paid leave for FMLA leave. If an employee does \n     not choose to substitute accrued paid leave, the employing \n     office may require the employee to substitute accrued paid \n     leave for FMLA leave.\n       (b) Where an employee has earned or accrued paid vacation, \n     personal or family leave, that paid leave may be substituted \n     for all or part of any (otherwise) unpaid FMLA leave relating \n     to birth, placement of a child for adoption or foster care, \n     or care for a spouse, child or parent who has a serious \n     health condition. The term ``family leave'' as used in FMLA \n     refers to paid leave provided by the employing office \n     covering the particular circumstances for which the employee \n     seeks leave for either the birth of a child and to care for \n     such child, placement of a child for adoption or foster care, \n     or care for a spouse, child or parent with a serious health \n     condition. For example, if the employing office's leave plan \n     allows use of family leave to care for a child but not for a \n     parent, the employing office is not required to allow accrued \n     family leave to be substituted for FMLA leave used to care \n     for a parent.\n       (c) Substitution of paid accrued vacation, personal, or \n     medical/sick leave may be made for any (otherwise) unpaid \n     FMLA leave needed to care for a family member or the \n     employee's own serious health condition. Substitution of paid \n     sick/medical leave may be elected to the extent the \n     circumstances meet the employing office's usual requirements \n     for the use of sick/medical leave. An employing office is not \n     required to allow substitution of paid sick or medical leave \n     for unpaid FMLA leave ``in any situation'' where the \n     employing office's uniform policy would not normally allow \n     such paid leave. An employee, therefore, has a right to \n     substitute paid medical/sick leave to care for a seriously \n     ill family member only if the employing office's leave plan \n     allows paid leave to be used for that purpose. Similarly, an \n     employee does not have a right to substitute paid medical/\n     sick leave for a serious health condition which is not \n     covered by the employing office's leave plan.\n       (d)(1) Disability leave for the birth of a child would be \n     considered FMLA leave for a serious health condition and \n     counted in the 12 weeks of leave permitted under FMLA as made \n     applicable by the CAA. Because the leave pursuant to a \n     temporary disability benefit plan is not unpaid, the \n     provision for substitution of paid leave is inapplicable. \n     However, the employing office may designate the leave as FMLA \n     leave and count the leave as running concurrently for \n     purposes of both the benefit plan and the FMLA leave \n     entitlement. If the requirements to qualify for payments \n     pursuant to the employing office's temporary disability plan \n     are more stringent than those of FMLA as made applicable by \n     the CAA, the employee must meet the more stringent \n     requirements of the plan, or may choose not to meet the \n     requirements of the plan and instead receive no payments from \n     the plan and use unpaid FMLA leave or substitute available \n     accrued paid leave.\n       (2) The FMLA as made applicable by the CAA provides that a \n     serious health condition may result from injury to the \n     employee ``on or off'' the job. If the employing office \n     designates the leave as FMLA leave in accordance with \n     Sec. 825.208, the employee's FMLA 12-week leave entitlement \n     may run concurrently with a workers' compensation absence \n     when the injury is one that meets the criteria for a serious \n     health condition. As the workers' compensation absence is not \n     unpaid leave, the provision for substitution of the \n     employee's accrued paid leave is not applicable. However, if \n     the health care provider treating the employee for the \n     workers' compensation injury certifies the employee is able \n     to return to a ``light duty job'' but is unable to return to \n     the same or equivalent job, the employee may decline the \n     employing office's offer of a ``light duty job''. As a result \n     the employee may lose workers' compensation payments, but is \n     entitled to remain on unpaid FMLA leave until the 12-week \n     entitlement is exhausted. As of the date workers' \n     compensation benefits cease, the substitution provision \n     becomes applicable and either the employee may elect or the \n     employing office may require the use of accrued paid leave. \n     See also Sec. Sec. 825.210(f), 825.216(d), 825.220(d), \n     825.307(a)(1) and 825.702 (d)(1) and (2) regarding the \n     relationship between workers' compensation absences and FMLA \n     leave.\n       (e) Paid vacation or personal leave, including leave earned \n     or accrued under plans allowing ``paid time off,'' may be \n     substituted, at either the employee's or the employing \n     office's option, for any qualified FMLA leave. No limitations \n     may be placed by the employing office on substitution of paid \n     vacation or personal leave for these purposes.\n       (f) If neither the employee nor the employing office elects \n     to substitute paid leave for unpaid FMLA leave under the \n     above conditions and circumstances, the employee will remain \n     entitled to all the paid leave which is earned or accrued \n     under the terms of the employing office's plan.\n       (g) If an employee uses paid leave under circumstances \n     which do not qualify as FMLA leave, the leave will not count \n     against the 12 weeks of FMLA leave to which the employee is \n     entitled. For example, paid sick leave used for a medical \n     condition which is not a serious health condition does not \n     count against the 12 weeks of FMLA leave entitlement.\n       (h) When an employee or employing office elects to \n     substitute paid leave (of any type) for unpaid FMLA leave \n     under circumstances permitted by these regulations, and the \n     employing office's procedural requirements for taking that \n     kind of leave are less stringent than the requirements of \n     FMLA as made applicable by the CAA (e.g., notice or \n     certification requirements), only the less stringent \n     requirements may be imposed. An employee who complies with an \n     employing office's less \n\n[[Page S 17639]]\n     stringent leave plan requirements in such cases may not have leave for \n     an FMLA purpose delayed or denied on the grounds that the \n     employee has not complied with stricter requirements of FMLA \n     as made applicable by the CAA. However, where accrued paid \n     vacation or personal leave is substituted for unpaid FMLA \n     leave for a serious health condition, an employee may be \n     required to comply with any less stringent medical \n     certification requirements of the employing office's sick \n     leave program. See Sec. Sec. 825.302(g), 825.305(e) and \n     825.306(c).\n       (i) Compensatory time off, if any is authorized under \n     applicable law, is not a form of accrued paid leave that an \n     employing office may require the employee to substitute for \n     unpaid FMLA leave. The employee may request to use his/her \n     balance of compensatory time for an FMLA reason. If the \n     employing office permits the accrual to be used in compliance \n     with regulations, if any [CAA regulations on compensatory \n     time off, if any], the absence which is paid from the \n     employee's accrued compensatory time ``account'' may not be \n     counted against the employee's FMLA leave entitlement.\n\n     Sec. 825.208 Under what circumstances may an employing office \n       designate leave, paid or unpaid, as FMLA leave and, as a \n       result, enable leave to be counted against the employee's \n       total FMLA leave entitlement?\n\n       (a) In all circumstances, it is the employing office's \n     responsibility to designate leave, paid or unpaid, as FMLA-\n     qualifying, and to give notice of the designation to the \n     employee as provided in this section. In the case of \n     intermittent leave or leave on a reduced schedule, only one \n     such notice is required unless the circumstances regarding \n     the leave have changed. The employing office's designation \n     decision must be based only on information received from the \n     employee or the employee's spokesperson (e.g., if the \n     employee is incapacitated, the employee's spouse, adult \n     child, parent, doctor, etc., may provide notice to the \n     employing office of the need to take FMLA leave). In any \n     circumstance where the employing office does not have \n     sufficient information about the reason for an employee's use \n     of paid leave, the employing office should inquire further of \n     the employee or the spokesperson to ascertain whether the \n     paid leave is potentially FMLA-qualifying.\n       (1) An employee giving notice of the need for unpaid FMLA \n     leave must explain the reasons for the needed leave so as to \n     allow the employing office to determine that the leave \n     qualifies under the FMLA, as made applicable by the CAA. If \n     the employee fails to explain the reasons, leave may be \n     denied. In many cases, in explaining the reasons for a \n     request to use paid leave, especially when the need for the \n     leave was unexpected or unforeseen, an employee will provide \n     sufficient information for the employing office to designate \n     the paid leave as FMLA leave. An employee using accrued paid \n     leave, especially vacation or personal leave, may in some \n     cases not spontaneously explain the reasons or their plans \n     for using their accrued leave.\n       (2) As noted in Sec. 825.302(c), an employee giving notice \n     of the need for unpaid FMLA leave does not need to expressly \n     assert rights under the FMLA as made applicable by the CAA or \n     even mention the FMLA to meet his or her obligation to \n     provide notice, though the employee would need to state a \n     qualifying reason for the needed leave. An employee \n     requesting or notifying the employing office of an intent to \n     use accrued paid leave, even if for a purpose covered by \n     FMLA, would not need to assert such right either. However, if \n     an employee requesting to use paid leave for an FMLA-\n     qualifying purpose does not explain the reason for the \n     leave--consistent with the employing office's established \n     policy or practice--and the employing office denies the \n     employee's request, the employee will need to provide \n     sufficient information to establish an FMLA-qualifying reason \n     for the needed leave so that the employing office is aware of \n     the employee's entitlement (i.e., that the leave may not be \n     denied) and, then, may designate that the paid leave be \n     appropriately counted against (substituted for) the \n     employee's 12-week entitlement. Similarly, an employee using \n     accrued paid vacation leave who seeks an extension of unpaid \n     leave for an FMLA-qualifying purpose will need to state the \n     reason. If this is due to an event which occurred during the \n     period of paid leave, the employing office may count the \n     leave used after the FMLA-qualifying event against the \n     employee's 12-week entitlement.\n       (b)(1) Once the employing office has acquired knowledge \n     that the leave is being taken for an FMLA required reason, \n     the employing office must promptly (within two business days \n     absent extenuating circumstances) notify the employee that \n     the paid leave is designated and will be counted as FMLA \n     leave. If there is a dispute between an employing office and \n     an employee as to whether paid leave qualifies as FMLA leave, \n     it should be resolved through discussions between the \n     employee and the employing office. Such discussions and the \n     decision must be documented.\n       (2) The employing office's notice to the employee that the \n     leave has been designated as FMLA leave may be orally or in \n     writing. If the notice is oral, it shall be confirmed in \n     writing, no later than the following payday (unless the \n     payday is less than one week after the oral notice, in which \n     case the notice must be no later than the subsequent payday). \n     The written notice may be in any form, including a notation \n     on the employee's pay stub.\n       (c) If the employing office requires paid leave to be \n     substituted for unpaid leave, or that paid leave taken under \n     an existing leave plan be counted as FMLA leave, this \n     decision must be made by the employing office within two \n     business days of the time the employee gives notice of the \n     need for leave, or, where the employing office does not \n     initially have sufficient information to make a \n     determination, when the employing office determines that the \n     leave qualifies as FMLA leave if this happens later. The \n     employing office's designation must be made before the leave \n     starts, unless the employing office does not have sufficient \n     information as to the employee's reason for taking the leave \n     until after the leave commenced. If the employing office has \n     the requisite knowledge to make a determination that the paid \n     leave is for an FMLA reason at the time the employee either \n     gives notice of the need for leave or commences leave and \n     fails to designate the leave as FMLA leave (and so notify the \n     employee in accordance with paragraph (b)), the employing \n     office may not designate leave as FMLA leave retroactively, \n     and may designate only prospectively as of the date of \n     notification to the employee of the designation. In such \n     circumstances, the employee is subject to the full \n     protections of the FMLA, as made applicable by the CAA, but \n     none of the absence preceding the notice to the employee of \n     the designation may be counted against the employee's 12-week \n     FMLA leave entitlement.\n       (d) If the employing office learns that leave is for an \n     FMLA purpose after leave has begun, such as when an employee \n     gives notice of the need for an extension of the paid leave \n     with unpaid FMLA leave, the entire or some portion of the \n     paid leave period may be retroactively counted as FMLA leave, \n     to the extent that the leave period qualified as FMLA leave. \n     For example, an employee is granted two weeks paid vacation \n     leave for a skiing trip. In mid-week of the second week, the \n     employee contacts the employing office for an extension of \n     leave as unpaid leave and advises that at the beginning of \n     the second week of paid vacation leave the employee suffered \n     a severe accident requiring hospitalization. The employing \n     office may notify the employee that both the extension and \n     the second week of paid vacation leave (from the date of the \n     injury) is designated as FMLA leave. On the other hand, when \n     the employee takes sick leave that turns into a serious \n     health condition (e.g., bronchitis that turns into bronchial \n     pneumonia) and the employee gives notice of the need for an \n     extension of leave, the entire period of the serious health \n     condition may be counted as FMLA leave.\n       (e) Employing offices may not designate leave as FMLA leave \n     after the employee has returned to work with two exceptions:\n       (1) If the employee was absent for an FMLA reason and the \n     employing office did not learn the reason for the absence \n     until the employee's return (e.g., where the employee was \n     absent for only a brief period), the employing office may, \n     upon the employee's return to work, promptly (within two \n     business days of the employee's return to work) designate the \n     leave retroactively with appropriate notice to the employee. \n     If leave is taken for an FMLA reason but the employing office \n     was not aware of the reason, and the employee desires that \n     the leave be counted as FMLA leave, the employee must notify \n     the employing office within two business days of returning to \n     work of the reason for the leave. In the absence of such \n     timely notification by the employee, the employee may not \n     subsequently assert FMLA protections for the absence.\n       (2) If the employing office knows the reason for the leave \n     but has not been able to confirm that the leave qualifies \n     under FMLA, or where the employing office has requested \n     medical certification which has not yet been received or the \n     parties are in the process of obtaining a second or third \n     medical opinion, the employing office should make a \n     preliminary designation, and so notify the employee, at the \n     time leave begins, or as soon as the reason for the leave \n     becomes known. Upon receipt of the requisite information from \n     the employee or of the medical certification which confirms \n     the leave is for an FMLA reason, the preliminary designation \n     becomes final. If the medical certifications fail to confirm \n     that the reason for the absence was an FMLA reason, the \n     employing office must withdraw the designation (with written \n     notice to the employee).\n       (f) If, before beginning employment with an employing \n     office, an employee had been employed by another employing \n     office, the subsequent employing office may count against the \n     employee's FMLA leave entitlement FMLA leave taken from the \n     prior employing office, except that, if the FMLA leave began \n     after the effective date of these regulations (or if the FMLA \n     leave was subject to other applicable requirement under which \n     the employing office was to have designated the leave as FMLA \n     leave), the prior employing office must have properly \n     designated the leave as FMLA under these regulations or other \n     applicable requirement.\n\n     Sec. 825.209 Is an employee entitled to benefits while using \n       FMLA leave?\n\n       (a) During any FMLA leave, the employing office must \n     maintain the employee's coverage under the Federal Employees \n     Health Benefits Program or any group health plan (as defined \n     in the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 at 26 U.S.C. 5000(b)(1)) \n     on the same conditions as coverage would have been provided \n\n[[Page S 17640]]\n     if the employee had been continuously employed during the entire leave \n     period. All employing offices are subject to the requirements \n     of the FMLA, as made applicable by the CAA, to maintain \n     health coverage. The definition of ``group health plan'' is \n     set forth in Sec. 825.800. For purposes of FMLA, the term \n     ``group health plan'' shall not include an insurance program \n     providing health coverage under which employees purchase \n     individual policies from insurers provided that:\n       (1) no contributions are made by the employing office;\n       (2) participation in the program is completely voluntary \n     for employees;\n       (3) the sole functions of the employing office with respect \n     to the program are, without endorsing the program, to permit \n     the insurer to publicize the program to employees, to collect \n     premiums through payroll deductions and to remit them to the \n     insurer;\n       (4) the employing office receives no consideration in the \n     form of cash or otherwise in connection with the program, \n     other than reasonable compensation, excluding any profit, for \n     administrative services actually rendered in connection with \n     payroll deduction; and\n       (5) the premium charged with respect to such coverage does \n     not increase in the event the employment relationship \n     terminates.\n       (b) The same group health plan benefits provided to an \n     employee prior to taking FMLA leave must be maintained during \n     the FMLA leave. For example, if family member coverage is \n     provided to an employee, family member coverage must be \n     maintained during the FMLA leave. Similarly, benefit coverage \n     during FMLA leave for medical care, surgical care, hospital \n     care, dental care, eye care, mental health counseling, \n     substance abuse treatment, etc., must be maintained during \n     leave if provided in an employing office's group health plan, \n     including a supplement to a group health plan, whether or not \n     provided through a flexible spending account or other \n     component of a cafeteria plan.\n       (c) If an employing office provides a new health plan or \n     benefits or changes health benefits or plans while an \n     employee is on FMLA leave, the employee is entitled to the \n     new or changed plan/benefits to the same extent as if the \n     employee were not on leave. For example, if an employing \n     office changes a group health plan so that dental care \n     becomes covered under the plan, an employee on FMLA leave \n     must be given the same opportunity as other employees to \n     receive (or obtain) the dental care coverage. Any other plan \n     changes (e.g., in coverage, premiums, deductibles, etc.) \n     which apply to all employees of the workforce would also \n     apply to an employee on FMLA leave.\n       (d) Notice of any opportunity to change plans or benefits \n     must also be given to an employee on FMLA leave. If the group \n     health plan permits an employee to change from single to \n     family coverage upon the birth of a child or otherwise add \n     new family members, such a change in benefits must be made \n     available while an employee is on FMLA leave. If the employee \n     requests the changed coverage it must be provided by the \n     employing office.\n       (e) An employee may choose not to retain group health plan \n     coverage during FMLA leave. However, when an employee returns \n     from leave, the employee is entitled to be reinstated on the \n     same terms as prior to taking the leave, including family or \n     dependent coverages, without any qualifying period, physical \n     examination, exclusion of pre-existing conditions, etc. See \n     Sec. 825.212(c).\n       (f) Except as required by the Consolidated Omnibus Budget \n     Reconciliation Act of 1986 (COBRA), or by other applicable \n     law, and for ``key'' employees (as discussed below), an \n     employing office's obligation to maintain health benefits \n     during leave (and to restore the employee to the same or \n     equivalent employment) under FMLA ceases if and when the \n     employment relationship would have terminated if the employee \n     had not taken FMLA leave (e.g., if the employee's position is \n     eliminated as part of a nondiscriminatory reduction in force \n     and the employee would not have been transferred to another \n     position); an employee informs the employing office of his or \n     her intent not to return from leave (including before \n     starting the leave if the employing office is so informed \n     before the leave starts); or the employee fails to return \n     from leave or continues on leave after exhausting his or \n     her FMLA leave entitlement in the 12-month period.\n       (g) If a ``key employee'' (see Sec. 825.218) does not \n     return from leave when notified by the employing office that \n     substantial or grievous economic injury will result from his \n     or her reinstatement, the employee's entitlement to group \n     health plan benefits continues unless and until the employee \n     advises the employing office that the employee does not \n     desire restoration to employment at the end of the leave \n     period, or FMLA leave entitlement is exhausted, or \n     reinstatement is actually denied.\n       (h) An employee's entitlement to benefits other than group \n     health benefits during a period of FMLA leave (e.g., holiday \n     pay) is to be determined by the employing office's \n     established policy for providing such benefits when the \n     employee is on other forms of leave (paid or unpaid, as \n     appropriate).\n\n     Sec. 825.210 How may employees on FMLA leave pay their share \n       of group health benefit premiums?\n\n       (a) Group health plan benefits must be maintained on the \n     same basis as coverage would have been provided if the \n     employee had been continuously employed during the FMLA leave \n     period. Therefore, any share of group health plan premiums \n     which had been paid by the employee prior to FMLA leave must \n     continue to be paid by the employee during the FMLA leave \n     period. If premiums are raised or lowered, the employee would \n     be required to pay the new premium rates. Maintenance of \n     health insurance policies which are not a part of the \n     employing office's group health plan, as described in \n     Sec. 825.209(a)(1), are the sole responsibility of the \n     employee. The employee and the insurer should make necessary \n     arrangements for payment of premiums during periods of unpaid \n     FMLA leave.\n       (b) If the FMLA leave is substituted paid leave, the \n     employee's share of premiums must be paid by the method \n     normally used during any paid leave, presumably as a payroll \n     deduction.\n       (c) If FMLA leave is unpaid, the employing office has a \n     number of options for obtaining payment from the employee. \n     The employing office may require that payment be made to the \n     employing office or to the insurance carrier, but no \n     additional charge may be added to the employee's premium \n     payment for administrative expenses. The employing office may \n     require employees to pay their share of premium payments in \n     any of the following ways:\n       (1) Payment would be due at the same time as it would be \n     made if by payroll deduction;\n       (2) Payment would be due on the same schedule as payments \n     are made under COBRA;\n       (3) Payment would be prepaid pursuant to a cafeteria plan \n     at the employee's option;\n       (4) The employing office's existing rules for payment by \n     employees on ``leave without pay'' would be followed, \n     provided that such rules do not require prepayment (i.e., \n     prior to the commencement of the leave) of the premiums that \n     will become due during a period of unpaid FMLA leave or \n     payment of higher premiums than if the employee had continued \n     to work instead of taking leave; or,\n       (5) Another system voluntarily agreed to between the \n     employing office and the employee, which may include \n     prepayment of premiums (e.g., through increased payroll \n     deductions when the need for the FMLA leave is foreseeable).\n       (d) The employing office must provide the employee with \n     advance written notice of the terms and conditions under \n     which these payments must be made. (See Sec. 825.301.)\n       (e) An employing office may not require more of an employee \n     using FMLA leave than the employing office requires of other \n     employees on ``leave without pay''.\n       (f) An employee who is receiving payments as a result of a \n     workers' compensation injury must make arrangements with the \n     employing office for payment of group health plan benefits \n     when simultaneously taking unpaid FMLA leave. See paragraph \n     (c) of this section and Sec. 825.207(d)(2).\n\n     Sec. 825.211 [Reserved.]\n\n     Sec. 825.212 What are the consequences of an employee's \n       failure to make timely health plan premium payments?\n\n       (a)(1) In the absence of an established employing office \n     policy providing a longer grace period, an employing office's \n     obligations to maintain health insurance coverage cease under \n     FMLA if an employee's premium payment is more than 30 days \n     late. In order to drop the coverage for an employee whose \n     premium payment is late, the employing office must provide \n     written notice to the employee that the payment has not been \n     received. Such notice must be mailed to the employee at least \n     15 days before coverage is to cease, advising that coverage \n     will be dropped on a specified date at least 15 days after \n     the date of the letter unless the payment has been received \n     by that date. If the employing office has established \n     policies regarding other forms of unpaid leave that provide \n     for the employing office to cease coverage retroactively to \n     the date the unpaid premium payment was due, the employing \n     office may drop the employee from coverage retroactively in \n     accordance with that policy, provided the 15-day notice was \n     given. In the absence of such a policy, coverage for the \n     employee may be terminated at the end of the 30-day grace \n     period, where the required 15-day notice has been provided.\n       (2) An employing office has no obligation regarding the \n     maintenance of a health insurance policy which is not a \n     ``group health plan.'' See Sec. 825.209(a).\n       (3) All other obligations of an employing office under FMLA \n     would continue; for example, the employing office continues \n     to have an obligation to reinstate an employee upon return \n     from leave.\n       (b) The employing office may recover the employee's share \n     of any premium payments missed by the employee for any FMLA \n     leave period during which the employing office maintains \n     health coverage by paying the employee's share after the \n     premium payment is missed.\n       (c) If coverage lapses because an employee has not made \n     required premium payments, upon the employee's return from \n     FMLA leave the employing office must still restore the \n     employee to coverage/benefits equivalent to those the \n     employee would have had if leave had not been taken and the \n     premium payment(s) had not been missed, including family or \n     dependent coverage. See Sec. 825.215(d)(1)-(5). In such case, \n     an employee may not be required to meet any qualification \n     requirements imposed by the plan, including any new \n     preexisting condition waiting period, to wait for an open \n     season, or to \n\n[[Page S 17641]]\n     pass a medical examination to obtain reinstatement of coverage.\n\n     Sec. 825.213 May an employing office recover costs it \n       incurred for maintaining ``group health plan'' or other \n       non-health benefits coverage during FMLA leave?\n\n       (a) In addition to the circumstances discussed in \n     Sec. 825.212(b), an employing office may recover its share of \n     health plan premiums during a period of unpaid FMLA leave \n     from an employee if the employee fails to return to work \n     after the employee's FMLA leave entitlement has been \n     exhausted or expires, unless the reason the employee does not \n     return is due to:\n       (1) The continuation, recurrence, or onset of a serious \n     health condition of the employee or the employee's family \n     member which would otherwise entitle the employee to leave \n     under FMLA; or\n       (2) Other circumstances beyond the employee's control. \n     Examples of ``other circumstances beyond the employee's \n     control'' are necessarily broad. They include such situations \n     as where a parent chooses to stay home with a newborn child \n     who has a serious health condition; an employee's spouse is \n     unexpectedly transferred to a job location more than 75 miles \n     from the employee's worksite; a relative or individual other \n     than an immediate family member has a serious health \n     condition and the employee is needed to provide care; the \n     employee is laid off while on leave; or, the employee is a \n     key employee'' who decides not to return to work upon being \n     notified of the employing office's intention to deny \n     restoration because of substantial and grievous economic \n     injury to the employing office's operations and is not \n     reinstated by the employing office. Other circumstances \n     beyond the employee's control would not include a situation \n     where an employee desires to remain with a parent in a \n     distant city even though the parent no longer requires the \n     employee's care, or a parent chooses not to return to work to \n     stay home with a well, newborn child.\n       (3) When an employee fails to return to work because of the \n     continuation, recurrence, or onset of a serious health \n     condition, thereby precluding the employing office from \n     recovering its (share of) health benefit premium payments \n     made on the employee's behalf during a period of unpaid FMLA \n     leave, the employing office may require medical certification \n     of the employee's or the family member's serious health \n     condition. Such certification is not required unless \n     requested by the employing office. The employee is required \n     to provide medical certification in a timely manner which, \n     for purposes of this section, is within 30 days from the date \n     of the employing office's request. For purposes of medical \n     certification, the employee may use the optional form \n     developed for this purpose (see Sec. 825.306(a) and Appendix \n     B of this part). If the employing office requests medical \n     certification and the employee does not provide such \n     certification in a timely manner (within 30 days), or the \n     reason for not returning to work does not meet the test of \n     other circumstances beyond the employee's control, the \n     employing office may recover 100% of the health benefit \n     premiums it paid during the period of unpaid FMLA leave.\n       (b) Under some circumstances an employing office may elect \n     to maintain other benefits, e.g., life insurance, disability \n     insurance, etc., by paying the employee's (share of) premiums \n     during periods of unpaid FMLA leave. For example, to ensure \n     the employing office can meet its responsibilities to provide \n     equivalent benefits to the employee upon return from unpaid \n     FMLA leave, it may be necessary that premiums be paid \n     continuously to avoid a lapse of coverage. If the employing \n     office elects to maintain such benefits during the leave, at \n     the conclusion of leave, the employing office is entitled to \n     recover only the costs incurred for paying the employee's \n     share of any premiums whether or not the employee returns to \n     work.\n       (c) An employee who returns to work for at least 30 \n     calendar days is considered to have ``returned'' to work. An \n     employee who transfers directly from taking FMLA leave to \n     retirement, or who retires during the first 30 days after the \n     employee returns to work, is deemed to have returned to work.\n       (d) When an employee elects or an employing office requires \n     paid leave to be substituted for FMLA leave, the employing \n     office may not recover its (share of) health insurance or \n     other non-health benefit premiums for any period of FMLA \n     leave covered by paid leave. Because paid leave provided \n     under a plan covering temporary disabilities (including \n     workers' compensation) is not unpaid, recovery of health \n     insurance premiums does not apply to such paid leave.\n       (e) The amount that self-insured employing offices may \n     recover is limited to only the employing office's share of \n     allowable ``premiums'' as would be calculated under COBRA, \n     excluding the 2 percent fee for administrative costs.\n       (f) When an employee fails to return to work, any health \n     and non-health benefit premiums which this section of the \n     regulations permits an employing office to recover are a debt \n     owed by the non-returning employee to the employing office. \n     The existence of this debt caused by the employee's failure \n     to return to work does not alter the employing office's \n     responsibilities for health benefit coverage and, under a \n     self-insurance plan, payment of claims incurred during the \n     period of FMLA leave. To the extent recovery is allowed, the \n     employing office may recover the costs through deduction from \n     any sums due to the employee (e.g., unpaid wages, vacation \n     pay, etc.), provided such deductions do not otherwise violate \n     applicable wage payment or other laws. Alternatively, the \n     employing office may initiate legal action against the \n     employee to recover such costs.\n\n     Sec. 825.214 What are an employee's rights on returning to \n       work from FMLA leave?\n\n       (a) On return from FMLA leave, an employee is entitled to \n     be returned to the same position the employee held when leave \n     commenced, or to an equivalent position with equivalent \n     benefits, pay, and other terms and conditions of employment. \n     An employee is entitled to such reinstatement even if the \n     employee has been replaced or his or her position has been \n     restructured to accommodate the employee's absence. See also \n     Sec. 825.106(e) for the obligations of employing offices that \n     are joint employing offices.\n       (b) If the employee is unable to perform an essential \n     function of the position because of a physical or mental \n     condition, including the continuation of a serious health \n     condition, the employee has no right to restoration to \n     another position under the FMLA. However, the employing \n     office's obligations may be governed by the Americans with \n     Disabilities Act (ADA). See Sec. 825.702.\n\n     Sec. 825.215 What is an equivalent position?\n\n       (a) An equivalent position is one that is virtually \n     identical to the employee's former position in terms of pay, \n     benefits and working conditions, including privileges, \n     perquisites and status. It must involve the same or \n     substantially similar duties and responsibilities, which must \n     entail substantially equivalent skill, effort, \n     responsibility, and authority.\n       (b) If an employee is no longer qualified for the position \n     because of the employee's inability to attend a necessary \n     course, renew a license, fly a minimum number of hours, etc., \n     as a result of the leave, the employee shall be given a \n     reasonable opportunity to fulfill those conditions upon \n     return to work.\n       (c) Equivalent Pay.--(1) An employee is entitled to any \n     unconditional pay increases which may have occurred during \n     the FMLA leave period, such as cost of living increases. Pay \n     increases conditioned upon seniority, length of service, or \n     work performed would not have to be granted unless it is the \n     employing office's policy or practice to do so with respect \n     to other employees on ``leave without pay.'' In such case, \n     any pay increase would be granted based on the employee's \n     seniority, length of service, work performed, etc., excluding \n     the period of unpaid FMLA leave. An employee is entitled to \n     be restored to a position with the same or equivalent pay \n     premiums, such as a shift differential. If an employee \n     departed from a position averaging ten hours of overtime (and \n     corresponding overtime pay) each week, an employee is \n     ordinarily entitled to such a position on return from FMLA \n     leave.\n       (2) Many employing offices pay bonuses in different forms \n     to employees for job-related performance such as for perfect \n     attendance, safety (absence of injuries or accidents on the \n     job) and exceeding production goals. Bonuses for perfect \n     attendance and safety do not require performance by the \n     employee but rather contemplate the absence of occurrences. \n     To the extent an employee who takes FMLA leave had met all \n     the requirements for either or both of these bonuses before \n     FMLA leave began, the employee is entitled to continue this \n     entitlement upon return from FMLA leave, that is, the \n     employee may not be disqualified for the bonus(es) for the \n     taking of FMLA leave. See Sec. 825.220 (b) and (c). A monthly \n     production bonus, on the other hand, does require performance \n     by the employee. If the employee is on FMLA leave during any \n     part of the period for which the bonus is computed, the \n     employee is entitled to the same consideration for the bonus \n     as other employees on paid or unpaid leave (as appropriate). \n     See paragraph (d)(2) of this section.\n       (d) Equivalent Benefits.--``Benefits'' include all benefits \n     provided or made available to employees by an employing \n     office, including group life insurance, health insurance, \n     disability insurance, sick leave, annual leave, educational \n     benefits, and pensions, regardless of whether such benefits \n     are provided by a practice or written policy of an employing \n     office through an employee benefit plan.\n       (1) At the end of an employee's FMLA leave, benefits must \n     be resumed in the same manner and at the same levels as \n     provided when the leave began, and subject to any changes in \n     benefit levels that may have taken place during the period of \n     FMLA leave affecting the entire workforce, unless otherwise \n     elected by the employee. Upon return from FMLA leave, an \n     employee cannot be required to requalify for any benefits the \n     employee enjoyed before FMLA leave began (including family or \n     dependent coverages). For example, if an employee was covered \n     by a life insurance policy before taking leave but is not \n     covered or coverage lapses during the period of unpaid FMLA \n     leave, the employee cannot be required to meet any \n     qualifications, such as taking a physical examination, in \n     order to requalify for life insurance upon return from leave. \n     Accordingly, some employing offices may find it necessary to \n     modify life insurance and other benefits programs in order to \n     restore employees to equivalent benefits upon return from \n     FMLA leave, make arrangements for continued payment of costs \n     to maintain such benefits during unpaid FMLA leave, or pay \n     these costs subject to recovery from the employee on return \n     from leave. See Sec. 825.213(b). \n\n[[Page S 17642]]\n\n       (2) An employee may, but is not entitled to, accrue any \n     additional benefits or seniority during unpaid FMLA leave. \n     Benefits accrued at the time leave began, however, (e.g., \n     paid vacation, sick or personal leave to the extent not \n     substituted for FMLA leave) must be available to an employee \n     upon return from leave.\n       (3) If, while on unpaid FMLA leave, an employee desires to \n     continue life insurance, disability insurance, or other types \n     of benefits for which he or she typically pays, the employing \n     office is required to follow established policies or \n     practices for continuing such benefits for other instances of \n     leave without pay. If the employing office has no established \n     policy, the employee and the employing office are encouraged \n     to agree upon arrangements before FMLA leave begins.\n       (4) With respect to pension and other retirement plans, any \n     period of unpaid FMLA leave shall not be treated as or \n     counted toward a break in service for purposes of vesting and \n     eligibility to participate. Also, if the plan requires an \n     employee to be employed on a specific date in order to be \n     credited with a year of service for vesting, contributions or \n     participation purposes, an employee on unpaid FMLA leave on \n     that date shall be deemed to have been employed on that date. \n     However, unpaid FMLA leave periods need not be treated as \n     credited service for purposes of benefit accrual, vesting and \n     eligibility to participate.\n       (5) Employees on unpaid FMLA leave are to be treated as if \n     they continued to work for purposes of changes to benefit \n     plans. They are entitled to changes in benefits plans, except \n     those which may be dependent upon seniority or accrual during \n     the leave period, immediately upon return from leave or to \n     the same extent they would have qualified if no leave had \n     been taken. For example if the benefit plan is predicated on \n     a pre-established number of hours worked each year and the \n     employee does not have sufficient hours as a result of taking \n     unpaid FMLA leave, the benefit is lost. (In this regard, \n     Sec. 825.209 addresses health benefits.)\n       (e) Equivalent Terms and Conditions of Employment.--An \n     equivalent position must have substantially similar duties, \n     conditions, responsibilities, privileges and status as the \n     employee's original position.\n       (1) The employee must be reinstated to the same or a \n     geographically proximate worksite (i.e., one that does not \n     involve a significant increase in commuting time or distance) \n     from where the employee had previously been employed. If the \n     employee's original worksite has been closed, the employee is \n     entitled to the same rights as if the employee had not been \n     on leave when the worksite closed. For example, if an \n     employing office transfers all employees from a closed \n     worksite to a new worksite in a different city, the employee \n     on leave is also entitled to transfer under the same \n     conditions as if he or she had continued to be employed.\n       (2) The employee is ordinarily entitled to return to the \n     same shift or the same or an equivalent work schedule.\n       (3) The employee must have the same or an equivalent \n     opportunity for bonuses and other similar discretionary and \n     non-discretionary payments.\n       (4) FMLA does not prohibit an employing office from \n     accommodating an employee's request to be restored to a \n     different shift, schedule, or position which better suits the \n     employee's personal needs on return from leave, or to offer a \n     promotion to a better position. However, an employee cannot \n     be induced by the employing office to accept a different \n     position against the employee's wishes.\n       (f) The requirement that an employee be restored to the \n     same or equivalent job with the same or equivalent pay, \n     benefits, and terms and conditions of employment does not \n     extend to de minimis or intangible, unmeasurable aspects of \n     the job. However, restoration to a job slated for lay-off \n     when the employee's original position is not would not meet \n     the requirements of an equivalent position.\n\n     Sec. 825.216 Are there any limitations on an employing \n       office's obligation to reinstate an employee?\n\n       (a) An employee has no greater right to reinstatement or to \n     other benefits and conditions of employment than if the \n     employee had been continuously employed during the FMLA leave \n     period. An employing office must be able to show that an \n     employee would not otherwise have been employed at the time \n     reinstatement is requested in order to deny restoration to \n     employment. For example;\n       (1) If an employee is laid off during the course of taking \n     FMLA leave and employment is terminated, the employing \n     office's responsibility to continue FMLA leave, maintain \n     group health plan benefits and restore the employee cease at \n     the time the employee is laid off, provided the employing \n     office has no continuing obligations under a collective \n     bargaining agreement or otherwise. An employing office would \n     have the burden of proving that an employee would have been \n     laid off during the FMLA leave period and, therefore, would \n     not be entitled to restoration.\n       (2) If a shift has been eliminated, or overtime has been \n     decreased, an employee would not be entitled to return to \n     work that shift or the original overtime hours upon \n     restoration. However, if a position on, for example, a night \n     shift has been filled by another employee, the employee is \n     entitled to return to the same shift on which employed before \n     taking FMLA leave.\n       (b) If an employee was hired for a specific term or only to \n     perform work on a discrete project, the employing office has \n     no obligation to restore the employee if the employment term \n     or project is over and the employing office would not \n     otherwise have continued to employ the employee.\n       (c) In addition to the circumstances explained above, an \n     employing office may deny job restoration to salaried \n     eligible employees (``key employees,'' as defined in \n     paragraph (c) of Sec. 825.217) if such denial is necessary to \n     prevent substantial and grievous economic injury to the \n     operations of the employing office; or may delay restoration \n     to an employee who fails to provide a fitness for duty \n     certificate to return to work under the conditions described \n     in Sec. 825.310.\n       (d) If the employee has been on a workers' compensation \n     absence during which FMLA leave has been taken concurrently, \n     and after 12 weeks of FMLA leave the employee is unable to \n     return to work, the employee no longer has the protections of \n     FMLA and must look to the workers' compensation statute or \n     ADA for any relief or protections.\n\n     Sec. 825.217 What is a ``key employee''?\n\n       (a) A ``key employee'' is a salaried FMLA-eligible employee \n     who is among the highest paid 10 percent of all the employees \n     employed by the employing office within 75 miles of the \n     employee's worksite.\n       (b) The term ``salaried'' means ``paid on a salary basis,'' \n     as defined in [CAA regulation based on 29 CFR 541.118]. This \n     is the regulation defining employees who may qualify as \n     exempt from the minimum wage and overtime requirements of the \n     FLSA as executive, administrative, and professional \n     employees.\n       (c) A ``key employee'' must be ``among the highest paid 10 \n     percent'' of all the employees--both salaried and non-\n     salaried, eligible and ineligible--who are employed by the \n     employing office within 75 miles of the worksite.\n       (1) In determining which employees are among the highest \n     paid 10 percent, year-to-date earnings are divided by weeks \n     worked by the employee (including weeks in which paid leave \n     was taken). Earnings include wages, premium pay, incentive \n     pay, and non-discretionary and discretionary bonuses. \n     Earnings do not include incentives whose value is determined \n     at some future date, e.g., benefits or perquisites.\n       (2) The determination of whether a salaried employee is \n     among the highest paid 10 percent shall be made at the time \n     the employee gives notice of the need for leave. No more than \n     10 percent of the employing office's employees within 75 \n     miles of the worksite may be ``key employees.''\n\n     Sec. 825.218 What does ``substantial and grievous economic \n       injury'' mean?\n\n       (a) In order to deny restoration to a key employee, an \n     employing office must determine that the restoration of the \n     employee to employment will cause ``substantial and grievous \n     economic injury'' to the operations of the employing office, \n     not whether the absence of the employee will cause such \n     substantial and grievous injury.\n       (b) An employing office may take into account its ability \n     to replace on a temporary basis (or temporarily do without) \n     the employee on FMLA leave. If permanent replacement is \n     unavoidable, the cost of then reinstating the employee can be \n     considered in evaluating whether substantial and grievous \n     economic injury will occur from restoration; in other words, \n     the effect on the operations of the employing office of \n     reinstating the employee in an equivalent position.\n       (c) A precise test cannot be set for the level of hardship \n     or injury to the employing office which must be sustained. If \n     the reinstatement of a ``key employee'' threatens the \n     economic viability of the employing office, that would \n     constitute ``substantial and grievous economic injury.'' A \n     lesser injury which causes substantial, long-term economic \n     injury would also be sufficient. Minor inconveniences and \n     costs that the employing office would experience in the \n     normal course would certainly not constitute ``substantial \n     and grievous economic injury.''\n       (d) FMLA's ``substantial and grievous economic injury'' \n     standard is different from and more stringent than the \n     ``undue hardship'' test under the ADA (see, also \n     Sec. 825.702).\n\n     Sec. 825.219 What are the rights of a key employee?\n\n       (a) An employing office who believes that reinstatement may \n     be denied to a key employee, must give written notice to the \n     employee at the time the employee gives notice of the need \n     for FMLA leave (or when FMLA leave commences, if earlier) \n     that he or she qualifies as a key employee. At the same \n     time, the employing office must also fully inform the \n     employee of the potential consequences with respect to \n     reinstatement and maintenance of health benefits if the \n     employing office should determine that substantial and \n     grievous economic injury to the employing office's \n     operations will result if the employee is reinstated from \n     FMLA leave. If such notice cannot be given immediately \n     because of the need to determine whether the employee is a \n     key employee, it shall be given as soon as practicable \n     after being notified of a need for leave (or the \n     commencement of leave, if earlier). It is expected that in \n     most circumstances there will be no desire that an \n     employee be denied restoration after FMLA leave and, \n     therefore, there would be no need to provide such notice. \n     However, an employing office who fails to provide such \n     timely notice will lose its right to deny restoration even \n     if substantial \n\n[[Page S 17643]]\n     and grievous economic injury will result from reinstatement.\n       (b) As soon as an employing office makes a good faith \n     determination, based on the facts available, that substantial \n     and grievous economic injury to its operations will result if \n     a key employee who has given notice of the need for FMLA \n     leave or is using FMLA leave is reinstated, the employing \n     office shall notify the employee in writing of its \n     determination, that it cannot deny FMLA leave, and that it \n     intends to deny restoration to employment on completion of \n     the FMLA leave. It is anticipated that an employing office \n     will ordinarily be able to give such notice prior to the \n     employee starting leave. The employing office must serve this \n     notice either in person or by certified mail. This notice \n     must explain the basis for the employing office's finding \n     that substantial and grievous economic injury will result, \n     and, if leave has commenced, must provide the employee a \n     reasonable time in which to return to work, taking into \n     account the circumstances, such as the length of the leave \n     and the urgency of the need for the employee to return.\n       (c) If an employee on leave does not return to work in \n     response to the employing office's notification of intent to \n     deny restoration, the employee continues to be entitled to \n     maintenance of health benefits and the employing office may \n     not recover its cost of health benefit premiums. A key \n     employee's rights under FMLA continue unless and until the \n     employee either gives notice that he or she no longer wishes \n     to return to work, or the employing office actually denies \n     reinstatement at the conclusion of the leave period.\n       (d) After notice to an employee has been given that \n     substantial and grievous economic injury will result if the \n     employee is reinstated to employment, an employee is still \n     entitled to request reinstatement at the end of the leave \n     period even if the employee did not return to work in \n     response to the employing office's notice. The employing \n     office must then again determine whether there will be \n     substantial and grievous economic injury from reinstatement, \n     based on the facts at that time. If it is determined that \n     substantial and grievous economic injury will result, the \n     employing office shall notify the employee in writing (in \n     person or by certified mail) of the denial of restoration.\n\n     Sec. 825.220 How are employees protected who request leave or \n       otherwise assert FMLA rights?\n\n       (a) The FMLA, as made applicable by the CAA, prohibits \n     interference with an employee's rights under the law, and \n     with legal proceedings or inquiries relating to an employee's \n     rights. More specifically, the law contains the following \n     employee protections:\n       (1) An employing office is prohibited from interfering \n     with, restraining, or denying the exercise of (or attempts to \n     exercise) any rights provided by the FMLA as made applicable \n     by the CAA.\n       (2) An employing office is prohibited from discharging or \n     in any other way discriminating against any covered employee \n     (whether or not an eligible employee) for opposing or \n     complaining about any unlawful practice under the FMLA as \n     made applicable by the CAA.\n       (3) All employing offices are prohibited from discharging \n     or in any other way discriminating against any covered \n     employee (whether or not an eligible employee) because that \n     covered employee has--\n       (i) Filed any charge, or has instituted (or caused to be \n     instituted) any proceeding under or related to the FMLA, as \n     made applicable by the CAA;\n       (ii) Given, or is about to give, any information in \n     connection with an inquiry or proceeding relating to a right \n     under the FMLA, as made applicable by the CAA;\n       (iii) Testified, or is about to testify, in any inquiry or \n     proceeding relating to a right under the FMLA, as made \n     applicable by the CAA.\n       (b) Any violations of the FMLA, as made applicable by the \n     CAA, or of these regulations constitute interfering with, \n     restraining, or denying the exercise of rights provided by \n     the FMLA as made applicable by the CAA. ``Interfering with'' \n     the exercise of an employee's rights would include, for \n     example, not only refusing to authorize FMLA leave, but \n     discouraging an employee from using such leave. It would also \n     include manipulation by an employing office to avoid \n     responsibilities under FMLA, for example:\n       (1) [Reserved];\n       (2) changing the essential functions of the job in order to \n     preclude the taking of leave;\n       (3) reducing hours available to work in order to avoid \n     employee eligibility.\n       (c) An employing office is prohibited from discriminating \n     against employees or prospective employees who have used FMLA \n     leave. For example, if an employee on leave without pay would \n     otherwise be entitled to full benefits (other than health \n     benefits), the same benefits would be required to be provided \n     to an employee on unpaid FMLA leave. By the same token, \n     employing offices cannot use the taking of FMLA leave as a \n     negative factor in employment actions, such as hiring, \n     promotions or disciplinary actions; nor can FMLA leave be \n     counted under ``no fault'' attendance policies.\n       (d) Employees cannot waive, nor may employing offices \n     induce employees to waive, their rights under FMLA. For \n     example, employees (or their collective bargaining \n     representatives) cannot ``trade off'' the right to take FMLA \n     leave against some other benefit offered by the employing \n     office. This does not prevent an employee's voluntary and \n     uncoerced acceptance (not as a condition of employment) of a \n     ``light duty'' assignment while recovering from a serious \n     health condition (see Sec. 825.702(d)). In such a \n     circumstance the employee's right to restoration to the same \n     or an equivalent position is available until 12 weeks have \n     passed within the 12-month period, including all FMLA leave \n     taken and the period of ``light duty.''\n       (e) Covered employees, and not merely eligible employees, \n     are protected from retaliation for opposing (e.g., filing a \n     complaint about) any practice which is unlawful under the \n     FMLA, as made applicable by the CAA. They are similarly \n     protected if they oppose any practice which they reasonably \n     believe to be a violation of the FMLA, as made applicable by \n     the CAA or regulations.\n\n\nSubpart C--How do Employees Learn of Their Rights and Obligations under \n  the FMLA, as Made Applicable by the CAA, and What Can an Employing \n                     Office Require of an Employee?\n\n     Sec. 825.300 [Reserved.]\n\n     Sec. 825.301 What notices to employees are required of \n       employing offices under the FMLA as made applicable by the \n       CAA?\n\n       (a)(1) If an employing office has any eligible employees \n     and has any written guidance to employees concerning employee \n     benefits or leave rights, such as in an employee handbook, \n     information concerning both entitlements and employee \n     obligations under the FMLA, as made applicable by the CAA, \n     must be included in the handbook or other document. For \n     example, if an employing office provides an employee handbook \n     to all employees that describes the employing office's \n     policies regarding leave, wages, attendance, and similar \n     matters, the handbook must incorporate information on FMLA \n     rights and responsibilities and the employing office's \n     policies regarding the FMLA, as made applicable by the CAA. \n     Informational publications describing the provisions of the \n     FMLA as made applicable by the CAA are available from the \n     Office of Compliance and may be incorporated in such \n     employing office handbooks or written policies.\n       (2) If such an employing office does not have written \n     policies, manuals, or handbooks describing employee benefits \n     and leave provisions, the employing office shall provide \n     written guidance to an employee concerning all the employee's \n     rights and obligations under the FMLA as made applicable by \n     the CAA. This notice shall be provided to employees each time \n     notice is given pursuant to paragraph (b), and in accordance \n     with the provisions of that paragraph. Employing offices may \n     duplicate and provide the employee a copy of the FMLA Fact \n     Sheet available from the Office of Compliance to provide such \n     guidance.\n       (b)(1) The employing office shall also provide the employee \n     with written notice detailing the specific expectations and \n     obligations of the employee and explaining any consequences \n     of a failure to meet these obligations. The written notice \n     must be provided to the employee in a language in which the \n     employee is literate (see Sec. 825.300(c)). Such specific \n     notice must include, as appropriate:\n       (i) that the leave will be counted against the employee's \n     annual FMLA leave entitlement (see Sec. 825.208);\n       (ii) any requirements for the employee to furnish medical \n     certification of a serious health condition and the \n     consequences of failing to do so (see Sec. 825.305);\n       (iii) the employee's right to substitute paid leave and \n     whether the employing office will require the substitution of \n     paid leave, and the conditions related to any substitution;\n       (iv) any requirement for the employee to make any premium \n     payments to maintain health benefits and the arrangements for \n     making such payments (see Sec. 825.210), and the possible \n     consequences of failure to make such payments on a timely \n     basis (i.e., the circumstances under which coverage may \n     lapse);\n       (v) any requirement for the employee to present a fitness-\n     for-duty certificate to be restored to employment (see \n     Sec. 825.310);\n       (vi) the employee's status as a ``key employee'' and the \n     potential consequence that restoration may be denied \n     following FMLA leave, explaining the conditions required for \n     such denial (see Sec. 825.218);\n       (vii) the employee's right to restoration to the same or an \n     equivalent job upon return from leave (see Sec. Sec. 825.214 \n     and 825.604); and,\n       (viii) the employee's potential liability for payment of \n     health insurance premiums paid by the employing office during \n     the employee's unpaid FMLA leave if the employee fails to \n     return to work after taking FMLA leave (see Sec. 825.213).\n       (2) The specific notice may include other information--\n     e.g., whether the employing office will require periodic \n     reports of the employee's status and intent to return to \n     work, but is not required to do so. A prototype notice is \n     contained in Appendix D of this part [reserved], or may be \n     obtained from the Office of Compliance, which employing \n     offices may adapt for their use to meet these specific notice \n     requirements.\n       (c) Except as provided in this subparagraph, the written \n     notice required by paragraph (b) (and by subparagraph (a)(2) \n     where applicable) must be provided to the employee no less \n     often than the first time in each six-month period that an \n     employee gives notice of the need for FMLA leave (if FMLA \n     leave is taken during the six-month period). The notice shall \n     be given within a reasonable time after notice of the need \n     for leave is given by the employee--within one or two \n\n[[Page S 17644]]\n     business days if feasible. If leave has already begun, the notice \n     should be mailed to the employee's address of record.\n       (1) If the specific information provided by the notice \n     changes with respect to a subsequent period of FMLA leave \n     during the six-month period, the employing office shall, \n     within one or two business days of receipt of the employee's \n     notice of need for leave, provide written notice referencing \n     the prior notice and setting forth any of the information in \n     subparagraph (b) which has changed. For example, if the \n     initial leave period were paid leave and the subsequent leave \n     period would be unpaid leave, the employing office may need \n     to give notice of the arrangements for making premium \n     payments.\n       (2)(i) Except as provided in subparagraph (ii), if the \n     employing office is requiring medical certification or a \n     ``fitness-for-duty'' report, written notice of the \n     requirement shall be given with respect to each employee \n     notice of a need for leave.\n       (ii) Subsequent written notification shall not be required \n     if the initial notice in the six-month period and the \n     employing office handbook or other written documents (if any) \n     describing the employing office's leave policies, clearly \n     provided that certification or a ``fitness-for-duty'' report \n     would be required (e.g., by stating that certification would \n     be required in all cases, by stating that certification would \n     be required in all cases in which leave of more than a \n     specified number of days is taken, or by stating that a \n     ``fitness-for-duty'' report would be required in all cases \n     for back injuries for employees in a certain occupation). \n     Where subsequent written notice is not required, at least \n     oral notice shall be provided. (See Sec. 825.305(a).)\n       (d) Employing offices are also expected to responsively \n     answer questions from employees concerning their rights and \n     responsibilities under the FMLA as made applicable under the \n     CAA.\n       (e) Employing offices furnishing FMLA-required notices to \n     sensory impaired individuals must also comply with all \n     applicable requirements under law.\n       (f) If an employing office fails to provide notice in \n     accordance with the provisions of this section, the employing \n     office may not take action against an employee for failure to \n     comply with any provision required to be set forth in the \n     notice.\n\n     Sec. 825.302 What notice does an employee have to give an \n       employing office when the need for FMLA leave is \n       foreseeable?\n\n       (a) An employee must provide the employing office at least \n     30 days advance notice before FMLA leave is to begin if the \n     need for the leave is foreseeable based on an expected birth, \n     placement for adoption or foster care, or planned medical \n     treatment for a serious health condition of the employee or \n     of a family member. If 30 days notice is not practicable, \n     such as because of a lack of knowledge of approximately when \n     leave will be required to begin, a change in circumstances, \n     or a medical emergency, notice must be given as soon as \n     practicable. For example, an employee's health condition may \n     require leave to commence earlier than anticipated before the \n     birth of a child. Similarly, little opportunity for notice \n     may be given before placement for adoption. Whether the leave \n     is to be continuous or is to be taken intermittently or on a \n     reduced schedule basis, notice need only be given one time, \n     but the employee shall advise the employing office as soon as \n     practicable if dates of scheduled leave change or are \n     extended, or were initially unknown.\n       (b) ``As soon as practicable'' means as soon as both \n     possible and practical, taking into account all of the facts \n     and circumstances in the individual case. For foreseeable \n     leave where it is not possible to give as much as 30 days \n     notice, ``as soon as practicable'' ordinarily would mean at \n     least verbal notification to the employing office within one \n     or two business days of when the need for leave becomes known \n     to the employee.\n       (c) An employee shall provide at least verbal notice \n     sufficient to make the employing office aware that the \n     employee needs FMLA-qualifying leave, and the anticipated \n     timing and duration of the leave. The employee need not \n     expressly assert rights under the FMLA as made applicable by \n     the CAA, or even mention the FMLA, but may only state that \n     leave is needed for an expected birth or adoption, for \n     example. The employing office should inquire further of the \n     employee if it is necessary to have more information about \n     whether FMLA leave is being sought by the employee, and \n     obtain the necessary details of the leave to be taken. In the \n     case of medical conditions, the employing office may find it \n     necessary to inquire further to determine if the leave is \n     because of a serious health condition and may request medical \n     certification to support the need for such leave (see \n     Sec. 825.305).\n       (d) An employing office may also require an employee to \n     comply with the employing office's usual and customary notice \n     and procedural requirements for requesting leave. For \n     example, an employing office may require that written notice \n     set forth the reasons for the requested leave, the \n     anticipated duration of the leave, and the anticipated start \n     of the leave. However, failure to follow such internal \n     employing office procedures will not permit an employing \n     office to disallow or delay an employee's taking FMLA leave \n     if the employee gives timely verbal or other notice.\n       (e) When planning medical treatment, the employee must \n     consult with the employing office and make a reasonable \n     effort to schedule the leave so as not to disrupt unduly the \n     employing office's operations, subject to the approval of the \n     health care provider. Employees are ordinarily expected to \n     consult with their employing offices prior to the scheduling \n     of treatment in order to work out a treatment schedule which \n     best suits the needs of both the employing office and the \n     employee. If an employee who provides notice of the need to \n     take FMLA leave on an intermittent basis for planned medical \n     treatment neglects to consult with the employing office to \n     make a reasonable attempt to arrange the schedule of \n     treatments so as not to unduly disrupt the employing office's \n     operations, the employing office may initiate discussions \n     with the employee and require the employee to attempt to make \n     such arrangements, subject to the approval of the health care \n     provider.\n       (f) In the case of intermittent leave or leave on a reduced \n     leave schedule which is medically necessary, an employee \n     shall advise the employing office, upon request, of the \n     reasons why the intermittent/reduced leave schedule is \n     necessary and of the schedule for treatment, if applicable. \n     The employee and employing office shall attempt to work out a \n     schedule which meets the employee's needs without unduly \n     disrupting the employing office's operations, subject to the \n     approval of the health care provider.\n       (g) An employing office may waive employees' FMLA notice \n     requirements. In addition, an employing office may not \n     require compliance with stricter FMLA notice requirements \n     where the provisions of a collective bargaining agreement or \n     applicable leave plan allow less advance notice to the \n     employing office. For example, if an employee (or employing \n     office) elects to substitute paid vacation leave for unpaid \n     FMLA leave (see Sec. 825.207), and the employing office's \n     paid vacation leave plan imposes no prior notification \n     requirements for taking such vacation leave, no advance \n     notice may be required for the FMLA leave taken in these \n     circumstances. On the other hand, FMLA notice requirements \n     would apply to a period of unpaid FMLA leave, unless the \n     employing office imposes lesser notice requirements on \n     employees taking leave without pay.\n\n     Sec. 825.303 What are the requirements for an employee to \n       furnish notice to an employing office where the need for \n       FMLA leave is not foreseeable?\n\n       (a) When the approximate timing of the need for leave is \n     not foreseeable, an employee should give notice to the \n     employing office of the need for FMLA leave as soon as \n     practicable under the facts and circumstances of the \n     particular case. It is expected that an employee will give \n     notice to the employing office within no more than one or two \n     working days of learning of the need for leave, except in \n     extraordinary circumstances where such notice is not \n     feasible. In the case of a medical emergency requiring leave \n     because of an employee's own serious health condition or to \n     care for a family member with a serious health condition, \n     written advance notice pursuant to an employing office's \n     internal rules and procedures may not be required when FMLA \n     leave is involved.\n       (b) The employee should provide notice to the employing \n     office either in person or by telephone, telegraph, facsimile \n     (``fax'') machine or other electronic means. Notice may be \n     given by the employee's spokesperson (e.g., spouse, adult \n     family member or other responsible party) if the employee is \n     unable to do so personally. The employee need not expressly \n     assert rights under the FMLA, as made applicable by the CAA, \n     or even mention the FMLA, but may only state that leave is \n     needed. The employing office will be expected to obtain any \n     additional required information through informal means. The \n     employee or spokesperson will be expected to provide more \n     information when it can readily be accomplished as a \n     practical matter, taking into consideration the exigencies of \n     the situation.\n\n     Sec. 825.304 What recourse do employing offices have if \n       employees fail to provide the required notice?\n\n       (a) An employing office may waive employees' FMLA notice \n     obligations or the employing office's own internal rules on \n     leave notice requirements.\n       (b) If an employee fails to give 30 days notice for \n     foreseeable leave with no reasonable excuse for the delay, \n     the employing office may delay the taking of FMLA leave until \n     at least 30 days after the date the employee provides notice \n     to the employing office of the need for FMLA leave.\n       (c) In all cases, in order for the onset of an employee's \n     FMLA leave to be delayed due to lack of required notice, it \n     must be clear that the employee had actual notice of the FMLA \n     notice requirements. This condition would be satisfied by the \n     employing office's proper posting, at the worksite where the \n     employee is employed, of the information regarding the FMLA \n     provided (pursuant to section 301(h)(2) of the CAA) by the \n     Office of Compliance to the employing office in a manner \n     suitable for posting. Furthermore, the need for leave and the \n     approximate date leave would be taken must have been clearly \n     foreseeable to the employee 30 days in advance of the leave. \n     For example, knowledge that an employee would receive a \n     telephone call about the availability of a child for adoption \n     at some unknown point in the future would not be sufficient.\n\n[[Page S 17645]]\n\n\n     Sec. 825.305 When must an employee provide medical \n       certification to support FMLA leave?\n\n       (a) An employing office may require that an employee's \n     leave to care for the employee's seriously-ill spouse, son, \n     daughter, or parent, or due to the employee's own serious \n     health condition that makes the employee unable to perform \n     one or more of the essential functions of the employee's \n     position, be supported by a certification issued by the \n     health care provider of the employee or the employee's ill \n     family member. An employing office must give notice of a \n     requirement for medical certification each time a \n     certification is required; such notice must be written notice \n     whenever required by Sec. 825.301. An employing office's oral \n     request to an employee to furnish any subsequent medical \n     certification is sufficient.\n       (b) When the leave is foreseeable and at least 30 days \n     notice has been provided, the employee should provide the \n     medical certification before the leave begins. When this is \n     not possible, the employee must provide the requested \n     certification to the employing office within the time frame \n     requested by the employing office (which must allow at least \n     15 calendar days after the employing office's request), \n     unless it is not practicable under the particular \n     circumstances to do so despite the employee's diligent, good \n     faith efforts.\n       (c) In most cases, the employing office should request that \n     an employee furnish certification from a health care provider \n     at the time the employee gives notice of the need for leave \n     or within two business days thereafter, or, in the case of \n     unforeseen leave, within two business days after the leave \n     commences. The employing office may request certification at \n     some later date if the employing office later has reason to \n     question the appropriateness of the leave or its duration.\n       (d) At the time the employing office requests \n     certification, the employing office must also advise an \n     employee of the anticipated consequences of an employee's \n     failure to provide adequate certification. The employing \n     office shall advise an employee whenever the employing office \n     finds a certification incomplete, and provide the employee a \n     reasonable opportunity to cure any such deficiency.\n       (e) If the employing office's sick or medical leave plan \n     imposes medical certification requirements that are less \n     stringent than the certification requirements of these \n     regulations, and the employee or employing office elects to \n     substitute paid sick, vacation, personal or family leave for \n     unpaid FMLA leave where authorized (see Sec. 825.207), only \n     the employing office's less stringent sick leave \n     certification requirements may be imposed.\n\n     Sec. 825.306 How much information may be required in medical \n       certifications of a serious health condition?\n\n       (a) The Office of Compliance has made available an optional \n     form (``Certification of Physician or Practitioner'') for \n     employees' (or their family members) use in obtaining medical \n     certification, including second and third opinions, from \n     health care providers that meets FMLA's certification \n     requirements. (See Appendix B to these regulations.) This \n     optional form reflects certification requirements so as to \n     permit the health care provider to furnish appropriate \n     medical information within his or her knowledge.\n       (b) The Certification of Physician or Practitioner form is \n     modeled closely on Form WH-380, as revised, which was \n     developed by the Department of Labor (see 29 C.F.R. Part 825, \n     Appendix B). The employing office may use the Office of \n     Compliance's form, or Form WH-380, as revised, or another \n     form containing the same basic information; however, no \n     additional information may be required. In all instances the \n     information on the form must relate only to the serious \n     health condition for which the current need for leave exists. \n     The form identifies the health care provider and type of \n     medical practice (including pertinent specialization, if \n     any), makes maximum use of checklist entries for ease in \n     completing the form, and contains required entries for:\n       (1) A certification as to which part of the definition of \n     serious health condition'' (see Sec. 825.114), if any, \n     applies to the patient's condition, and the medical facts \n     which support the certification, including a brief statement \n     as to how the medical facts meet the criteria of the \n     definition.\n       (2)(i) The approximate date the serious health condition \n     commenced, and its probable duration, including the probable \n     duration of the patient's present incapacity (defined to mean \n     inability to work, attend school or perform other regular \n     daily activities due to the serious health condition, \n     treatment therefor, or recovery therefrom) if different.\n       (ii) Whether it will be necessary for the employee to take \n     leave intermittently or to work on a reduced leave schedule \n     basis (i.e., part-time) as a result of the serious health \n     condition (see Sec. 825.117 and Sec. 825.203), and if so, the \n     probable duration of such schedule.\n       (iii) If the condition is pregnancy or a chronic condition \n     within the meaning of Sec. 825.114(a)(2)(iii), whether the \n     patient is presently incapacitated and the likely duration \n     and frequency of episodes of incapacity.\n       (3)(i)(A) If additional treatments will be required for the \n     condition, an estimate of the probable number of such \n     treatments.\n       (B) If the patient's incapacity will be intermittent, or \n     will require a reduced leave schedule, an estimate of the \n     probable number and interval between such treatments, actual \n     or estimated dates of treatment if known, and period required \n     for recovery if any.\n       (ii) If any of the treatments referred to in subparagraph \n     (i) will be provided by another provider of health services \n     (e.g., physical therapist), the nature of the treatments.\n       (iii) If a regimen of continuing treatment by the patient \n     is required under the supervision of the health care \n     provider, a general description of the regimen (see \n     Sec. 825.114(b)).\n       (4) If medical leave is required for the employee's absence \n     from work because of the employee's own condition (including \n     absences due to pregnancy or a chronic condition), whether \n     the employee:\n       (i) is unable to perform work of any kind;\n       (ii) is unable to perform any one or more of the essential \n     functions of the employee's position, including a statement \n     of the essential functions the employee is unable to perform \n     (see Sec. 825.115), based on either information provided on a \n     statement from the employing office of the essential \n     functions of the position or, if not provided, discussion \n     with the employee about the employee's job functions; or\n       (iii) must be absent from work for treatment.\n       (5)(i) If leave is required to care for a family member of \n     the employee with a serious health condition, whether the \n     patient requires assistance for basic medical or personal \n     needs or safety, or for transportation; or if not, whether \n     the employee's presence to provide psychological comfort \n     would be beneficial to the patient or assist in the patient's \n     recovery. The employee is required to indicate on the form \n     the care he or she will provide and an estimate of the \n     time period.\n       (ii) If the employee's family member will need care only \n     intermittently or on a reduced leave schedule basis (i.e., \n     part-time), the probable duration of the need.\n       (c) If the employing office's sick or medical leave plan \n     requires less information to be furnished in medical \n     certifications than the certification requirements of these \n     regulations, and the employee or employing office elects to \n     substitute paid sick, vacation, personal or family leave for \n     unpaid FMLA leave where authorized (see Sec. 825.207), only \n     the employing office's lesser sick leave certification \n     requirements may be imposed.\n\n     Sec. 825.307 What may an employing office do if it questions \n       the adequacy of a medical certification?\n\n       (a) If an employee submits a complete certification signed \n     by the health care provider, the employing office may not \n     request additional information from the employee's health \n     care provider. However, a health care provider representing \n     the employing office may contact the employee's health care \n     provider, with the employee's permission, for purposes of \n     clarification and authenticity of the medical certification.\n       (1) If an employee is on FMLA leave running concurrently \n     with a workers'' compensation absence, and the provisions of \n     the workers'' compensation statute permit the employing \n     office or the employing office's representative to have \n     direct contact with the employee's workers'' compensation \n     health care provider, the employing office may follow the \n     workers'' compensation provisions.\n       (2) An employing office that has reason to doubt the \n     validity of a medical certification may require the employee \n     to obtain a second opinion at the employing office's expense. \n     Pending receipt of the second (or third) medical opinion, the \n     employee is provisionally entitled to the benefits of the \n     FMLA as made applicable by the CAA, including maintenance of \n     group health benefits. If the certifications do not \n     ultimately establish the employee's entitlement to FMLA \n     leave, the leave shall not be designated as FMLA leave and \n     may be treated as paid or unpaid leave under the employing \n     office's established leave policies. The employing office is \n     permitted to designate the health care provider to furnish \n     the second opinion, but the selected health care provider may \n     not be employed on a regular basis by the employing office. \n     See also paragraphs (e) and (f) of this section.\n       (b) The employing office may not regularly contract with or \n     otherwise regularly utilize the services of the health care \n     provider furnishing the second opinion unless the employing \n     office is located in an area where access to health care is \n     extremely limited (e.g., a rural area where no more than one \n     or two doctors practice in the relevant specialty in the \n     vicinity).\n       (c) If the opinions of the employee's and the employing \n     office's designated health care providers differ, the \n     employing office may require the employee to obtain \n     certification from a third health care provider, again at the \n     employing office's expense. This third opinion shall be final \n     and binding. The third health care provider must be \n     designated or approved jointly by the employing office and \n     the employee. The employing office and the employee must each \n     act in good faith to attempt to reach agreement on whom to \n     select for the third opinion provider. If the employing \n     office does not attempt in good faith to reach agreement, the \n     employing office will be bound by the first certification. If \n     the employee does not attempt in good faith to reach \n     agreement, the employee will be bound by the second \n     certification. For example, an employee who refuses to agree \n     to see a doctor in the specialty in question may be failing \n     to act in good faith. On the other hand, an employing office \n     that refuses to agree to any doctor on a list of specialists \n     in the appropriate field provided by the employee and \n\n[[Page S 17646]]\n     whom the employee has not previously consulted may be failing to act in \n     good faith.\n       (d) The employing office is required to provide the \n     employee with a copy of the second and third medical \n     opinions, where applicable, upon request by the employee. \n     Requested copies are to be provided within two business days \n     unless extenuating circumstances prevent such action.\n       (e) If the employing office requires the employee to obtain \n     either a second or third opinion the employing office must \n     reimburse an employee or family member for any reasonable out \n     of pocket'' travel expenses incurred to obtain the second and \n     third medical opinions. The employing office may not require \n     the employee or family member to travel outside normal \n     commuting distance for purposes of obtaining the second or \n     third medical opinions except in very unusual circumstances.\n       (f) In circumstances when the employee or a family member \n     is visiting in another country, or a family member resides in \n     another country, and a serious health condition develops, the \n     employing office shall accept a medical certification as well \n     as second and third opinions from a health care provider who \n     practices in that country.\n\n     Sec. 825.308 Under what circumstances may an employing office \n       request subsequent recertifications of medical conditions?\n\n       (a) For pregnancy, chronic, or permanent/long-term \n     conditions under continuing supervision of a health care \n     provider (as defined in Sec. 825.114(a) (2)(ii), (iii) or \n     (iv)), an employing office may request recertification no \n     more often than every 30 days and only in connection with an \n     absence by the employee, unless:\n       (1) Circumstances described by the previous certification \n     have changed significantly (e.g., the duration or frequency \n     of absences, the severity of the condition, complications); \n     or\n       (2) The employing office receives information that casts \n     doubt upon the employee's stated reason for the absence.\n       (b)(1) If the minimum duration of the period of incapacity \n     specified on a certification furnished by the health care \n     provider is more than 30 days, the employing office may not \n     request recertification until that minimum duration has \n     passed unless one of the conditions set forth in paragraph \n     (c)(1), (2) or (3) of this section is met.\n       (2) For FMLA leave taken intermittently or on a reduced \n     leave schedule basis, the employing office may not request \n     recertification in less than the minimum period specified on \n     the certification as necessary for such leave (including \n     treatment) unless one of the conditions set forth in \n     paragraph (c)(1), (2) or (3) of this section is met.\n       (c) For circumstances not covered by paragraphs (a) or (b) \n     of this section, an employing office may request \n     recertification at any reasonable interval, but not more \n     often than every 30 days, unless:\n       (1) The employee requests an extension of leave;\n       (2) Circumstances described by the previous certification \n     have changed significantly (e.g., the duration of the \n     illness, the nature of the illness, complications); or\n       (3) The employing office receives information that casts \n     doubt upon the continuing validity of the certification.\n       (d) The employee must provide the requested recertification \n     to the employing office within the time frame requested by \n     the employing office (which must allow at least 15 calendar \n     days after the employing office's request), unless it is not \n     practicable under the particular circumstances to do so \n     despite the employee's diligent, good faith efforts.\n       (e) Any recertification requested by the employing office \n     shall be at the employee's expense unless the employing \n     office provides otherwise. No second or third opinion on \n     recertification may be required.\n\n     Sec. 825.309 What notice may an employing office require \n       regarding an employee's intent to return to work?\n\n       (a) An employing office may require an employee on FMLA \n     leave to report periodically on the employee's status and \n     intent to return to work. The employing office's policy \n     regarding such reports may not be discriminatory and must \n     take into account all of the relevant facts and circumstances \n     related to the individual employee's leave situation.\n       (b) If an employee gives unequivocal notice of intent not \n     to return to work, the employing office's obligations under \n     FMLA, as made applicable by the CAA, to maintain health \n     benefits (subject to applicable requirements of law) and to \n     restore the employee cease. However, these obligations \n     continue if an employee indicates he or she may be unable to \n     return to work but expresses a continuing desire to do so.\n       (c) It may be necessary for an employee to take more leave \n     than originally anticipated. Conversely, an employee may \n     discover after beginning leave that the circumstances have \n     changed and the amount of leave originally anticipated is no \n     longer necessary. An employee may not be required to take \n     more FMLA leave than necessary to resolve the circumstance \n     that precipitated the need for leave. In both of these \n     situations, the employing office may require that the \n     employee provide the employing office reasonable notice \n     (i.e., within two business days) of the changed circumstances \n     where foreseeable. The employing office may also obtain \n     information on such changed circumstances through requested \n     status reports.\n\n     Sec. 825.310 Under what circumstances may an employing office \n       require that an employee submit a medical certification \n       that the employee is able (or unable) to return to work \n       (i.e., a ``fitness-for-duty'' report)?\n\n       (a) As a condition of restoring an employee whose FMLA \n     leave was occasioned by the employee's own serious health \n     condition that made the employee unable to perform the \n     employee's job, an employing office may have a uniformly-\n     applied policy or practice that requires all similarly-\n     situated employees (i.e., same occupation, same serious \n     health condition) who take leave for such conditions to \n     obtain and present certification from the employee's health \n     care provider that the employee is able to resume work.\n       (b) If the terms of a collective bargaining agreement \n     govern an employee's return to work, those provisions shall \n     be applied. Similarly, requirements under the Americans with \n     Disabilities Act (ADA), as made applicable by the CAA, that \n     any return-to-work physical be job-related and consistent \n     with business necessity apply. For example, an attorney could \n     not be required to submit to a medical examination or inquiry \n     just because her leg had been amputated. The essential \n     functions of an attorney's job do not require use of both \n     legs; therefore such an inquiry would not be job related. An \n     employing office may require a warehouse laborer, whose back \n     impairment affects the ability to lift, to be examined by an \n     orthopedist, but may not require this employee to submit to \n     an HIV test where the test is not related to either the \n     essential functions of his/her job or to his/her impairment.\n       (c) An employing office may seek fitness-for-duty \n     certification only with regard to the particular health \n     condition that caused the employee's need for FMLA leave. The \n     certification itself need only be a simple statement of an \n     employee's ability to return to work. A health care provider \n     employed by the employing office may contact the employee's \n     health care provider with the employee's permission, for \n     purposes of clarification of the employee's fitness to return \n     to work. No additional information may be acquired, and \n     clarification may be requested only for the serious health \n     condition for which FMLA leave was taken. The employing \n     office may not delay the employee's return to work while \n     contact with the health care provider is being made.\n       (d) The cost of the certification shall be borne by the \n     employee and the employee is not entitled to be paid for the \n     time or travel costs spent in acquiring the certification.\n       (e) The notice that employing offices are required to give \n     to each employee giving notice of the need for FMLA leave \n     regarding their FMLA rights and obligations as made \n     applicable by the CAA (see Sec. 825.301) shall advise the \n     employee if the employing office will require fitness-for-\n     duty certification to return to work. If the employing office \n     has a handbook explaining employment policies and benefits, \n     the handbook should explain the employing office's general \n     policy regarding any requirement for fitness-for-duty \n     certification to return to work. Specific notice shall also \n     be given to any employee from whom fitness-for-duty \n     certification will be required either at the time notice of \n     the need for leave is given or immediately after leave \n     commences and the employing office is advised of the medical \n     circumstances requiring the leave, unless the employee's \n     condition changes from one that did not previously require \n     certification pursuant to the employing office's practice or \n     policy. No second or third fitness-for-duty certification may \n     be required.\n       (f) An employing office may delay restoration to employment \n     until an employee submits a required fitness-for-duty \n     certification unless the employing office has failed to \n     provide the notices required in paragraph (e) of this \n     section.\n       (g) An employing office is not entitled to certification of \n     fitness to return to duty when the employee takes \n     intermittent leave as described in Sec. 825.203.\n       (h) When an employee is unable to return to work after FMLA \n     leave because of the continuation, recurrence, or onset of \n     the employee's or family member's serious health condition, \n     thereby preventing the employing office from recovering its \n     share of health benefit premium payments made on the \n     employee's behalf during a period of unpaid FMLA leave, the \n     employing office may require medical certification of the \n     employee's or the family member's serious health condition. \n     (See Sec. 825.213(a)(3).) The cost of the certification shall \n     be borne by the employee and the employee is not entitled to \n     be paid for the time or travel costs spent in acquiring the \n     certification.\n\n     Sec. 825.311 What happens if an employee fails to satisfy the \n       medical certification and/or recertification requirements?\n\n       (a) In the case of foreseeable leave, an employing office \n     may delay the taking of FMLA leave to an employee who fails \n     to provide timely certification after being requested by the \n     employing office to furnish such certification (i.e., within \n     15 calendar days, if practicable), until the required \n     certification is provided.\n       (b) When the need for leave is not foreseeable, or in the \n     case of recertification, an employee must provide \n     certification (or recertification) within the time frame \n     requested by the employing office (which must \n\n[[Page S 17647]]\n     allow at least 15 days after the employing office's request) or as soon \n     as reasonably possible under the particular facts and \n     circumstances. In the case of a medical emergency, it may not \n     be practicable for an employee to provide the required \n     certification within 15 calendar days. If an employee fails \n     to provide a medical certification within a reasonable time \n     under the pertinent circumstances, the employing office may \n     delay the employee's continuation of FMLA leave. If the \n     employee never produces the certification, the leave is not \n     FMLA leave.\n       (c) When requested by the employing office pursuant to a \n     uniformly applied policy for similarly-situated employees, \n     the employee must provide medical certification at the time \n     the employee seeks reinstatement at the end of FMLA leave \n     taken for the employee's serious health condition, that the \n     employee is fit for duty and able to return to work (see \n     Sec. 825.310(a)) if the employing office has provided the \n     required notice (see Sec. 825.301(c); the employing office \n     may delay restoration until the certification is provided. In \n     this situation, unless the employee provides either a \n     fitness-for-duty certification or a new medical certification \n     for a serious health condition at the time FMLA leave is \n     concluded, the employee may be terminated. See also \n     Sec. 825.213(a)(3).\n\n     Sec. 825.312 Under what circumstances may an employing office \n       refuse to provide FMLA leave or reinstatement to eligible \n       employees?\n\n       (a) If an employee fails to give timely advance notice when \n     the need for FMLA leave is foreseeable, the employing office \n     may delay the taking of FMLA leave until 30 days after the \n     date the employee provides notice to the employing office of \n     the need for FMLA leave. (See Sec. 825.302.)\n       (b) If an employee fails to provide in a timely manner a \n     requested medical certification to substantiate the need for \n     FMLA leave due to a serious health condition, an employing \n     office may delay continuation of FMLA leave until an employee \n     submits the certificate. (See Sec. Sec. 825.305 and 825.311.) \n     If the employee never produces the certification, the leave \n     is not FMLA leave.\n       (c) If an employee fails to provide a requested fitness-\n     for-duty certification to return to work, an employing office \n     may delay restoration until the employee submits the \n     certificate. (See Sec. Sec. 825.310 and 825.311.)\n       (d) An employee has no greater right to reinstatement or to \n     other benefits and conditions of employment than if the \n     employee had been continuously employed during the FMLA leave \n     period. Thus, an employee's rights to continued leave, \n     maintenance of health benefits, and restoration cease under \n     FMLA, as made applicable by the CAA, if and when the \n     employment relationship terminates (e.g., layoff), unless \n     that relationship continues, for example, by the employee \n     remaining on paid FMLA leave. If the employee is recalled or \n     otherwise re-employed, an eligible employee is immediately \n     entitled to further FMLA leave for an FMLA-qualifying reason. \n     An employing office must be able to show, when an employee \n     requests restoration, that the employee would not otherwise \n     have been employed if leave had not been taken in order to \n     deny restoration to employment. (See Sec. 825.216.)\n       (e) An employing office may require an employee on FMLA \n     leave to report periodically on the employee's status and \n     intention to return to work. (See Sec. 825.309.) If an \n     employee unequivocally advises the employing office either \n     before or during the taking of leave that the employee does \n     not intend to return to work, and the employment relationship \n     is terminated, the employee's entitlement to continued leave, \n     maintenance of health benefits, and restoration ceases unless \n     the employment relationship continues, for example, by the \n     employee remaining on paid leave. An employee may not be \n     required to take more leave than necessary to address the \n     circumstances for which leave was taken. If the employee is \n     able to return to work earlier than anticipated, the employee \n     shall provide the employing office two business days notice \n     where feasible; the employing office is required to restore \n     the employee once such notice is given, or where such prior \n     notice was not feasible.\n       (f) An employing office may deny restoration to employment, \n     but not the taking of FMLA leave and the maintenance of \n     health benefits, to an eligible employee only under the terms \n     of the key employee'' exemption. Denial of reinstatement must \n     be necessary to prevent substantial and grievous economic \n     injury'' to the employing office's operations. The employing \n     office must notify the employee of the employee's status as a \n     key employee'' and of the employing office's intent to deny \n     reinstatement on that basis when the employing office makes \n     these determinations. If leave has started, the employee must \n     be given a reasonable opportunity to return to work after \n     being so notified. (See Sec. 825.219.)\n       (g) An employee who fraudulently obtains FMLA leave from an \n     employing office is not protected by job restoration or \n     maintenance of health benefits provisions of the FMLA as made \n     applicable by the CAA.\n       (h) If the employing office has a uniformly-applied policy \n     governing outside or supplemental employment, such a policy \n     may continue to apply to an employee while on FMLA leave. An \n     employing office which does not have such a policy may not \n     deny benefits to which an employee is entitled under FMLA as \n     made applicable by the CAA on this basis unless the FMLA \n     leave was fraudulently obtained as in paragraph (g) of this \n     section.\n\n\n      Subpart D--What Enforcement Mechanisms Does the CAA Provide?\n\n     Sec. 825.400 What can employees do who believe that their \n       rights under the FMLA as made applicable by the CAA have \n       been violated?\n\n       (a) To commence a proceeding, a covered employee alleging a \n     violation of the rights and protections of the FMLA made \n     applicable by the CAA must request counseling by the Office \n     of Compliance not later than 180 days after the date of the \n     alleged violation. If a covered employee misses this \n     deadline, the covered employee will be unable to obtain a \n     remedy under the CAA.\n       (b) The following procedures are available under title IV \n     of the CAA for covered employees who believe that their \n     rights under FMLA as made applicable by the CAA have been \n     violated:\n       (1) counseling;\n       (2) mediation; and\n       (3) election of either--\n       (A) a formal complaint, filed with the Office of \n     Compliance, and a hearing before a hearing officer, subject \n     to review by the Board of Directors of the Office of \n     Compliance, and judicial review in the United States Court of \n     Appeals for the Federal Circuit; or\n       (B) a civil action in a district court of the United \n     States.\n       (c) Regulations of the Office of Compliance describing and \n     governing these procedures are found at [proposed rules can \n     be found at 141 Cong. Rec. S17012 (November 14, 1995)].\n\n     Sec. 825.401 [Reserved.]\n\n     Sec. 825.402 [Reserved.]\n\n     Sec. 825.403 [Reserved.]\n\n     Sec. 825.404 [Reserved.]\n\n\n                         Subpart E--[Reserved.]\n\n      Subpart F--What Special Rules Apply to Employees of Schools?\n\n     Sec. 825.600 To whom do the special rules apply?\n\n       (a) Certain special rules apply to employees of ``local \n     educational agencies,'' including public school boards and \n     elementary schools under their jurisdiction, and private \n     elementary and secondary schools. The special rules do not \n     apply to other kinds of educational institutions, such as \n     colleges and universities, trade schools, and preschools.\n       (b) Educational institutions are covered by FMLA as made \n     applicable by the CAA (and these special rules). The usual \n     requirements for employees to be ``eligible'' do apply, \n     however.\n       (c) The special rules affect the taking of intermittent \n     leave or leave on a reduced leave schedule, or leave near the \n     end of an academic term (semester), by instructional \n     employees. ``Instructional employees'' are those whose \n     principal function is to teach and instruct students in a \n     class, a small group, or an individual setting. This term \n     includes not only teachers, but also athletic coaches, \n     driving instructors, and special education assistants such as \n     signers for the hearing impaired. It does not include, and \n     the special rules do not apply to, teacher assistants or \n     aides who do not have as their principal job actual teaching \n     or instructing, nor does it include auxiliary personnel such \n     as counselors, psychologists, or curriculum specialists. It \n     also does not include cafeteria workers, maintenance workers, \n     or bus drivers.\n       (d) Special rules which apply to restoration to an \n     equivalent position apply to all employees of local \n     educational agencies.\n\n     Sec. 825.601 What limitations apply to the taking of \n       intermittent leave or leave on a reduced leave schedule?\n\n       (a) Leave taken for a period that ends with the school year \n     and begins the next semester is leave taken consecutively \n     rather than intermittently. The period during the summer \n     vacation when the employee would not have been required to \n     report for duty is not counted against the employee's FMLA \n     leave entitlement. An instructional employee who is on FMLA \n     leave at the end of the school year must be provided with any \n     benefits over the summer vacation that employees would \n     normally receive if they had been working at the end of the \n     school year.\n       (1) If an eligible instructional employee needs \n     intermittent leave or leave on a reduced leave schedule to \n     care for a family member, or for the employee's own serious \n     health condition, which is foreseeable based on planned \n     medical treatment, and the employee would be on leave for \n     more than 20 percent of the total number of working days over \n     the period the leave would extend, the employing office may \n     require the employee to choose either to:\n       (i) Take leave for a period or periods of a particular \n     duration, not greater than the duration of the planned \n     treatment; or\n       (ii) Transfer temporarily to an available alternative \n     position for which the employee is qualified, which has \n     equivalent pay and benefits and which better accommodates \n     recurring periods of leave than does the employee's regular \n     position.\n       (2) These rules apply only to a leave involving more than \n     20 percent of the working days during the period over which \n     the leave extends. For example, if an instructional employee \n     who normally works five days each week needs to take two days \n     of FMLA leave \n\n[[Page S 17648]]\n     per week over a period of several weeks, the special rules would apply. \n     Employees taking leave which constitutes 20 percent or less \n     of the working days during the leave period would not be \n     subject to transfer to an alternative position. ``Periods of \n     a particular duration'' means a block, or blocks, of time \n     beginning no earlier than the first day for which leave is \n     needed and ending no later than the last day on which leave \n     is needed, and may include one uninterrupted period of leave.\n       (b) If an instructional employee does not give required \n     notice of foreseeable FMLA leave (see Sec. 825.302) to be \n     taken intermittently or on a reduced leave schedule, the \n     employing office may require the employee to take leave of a \n     particular duration, or to transfer temporarily to an \n     alternative position. Alternatively, the employing office may \n     require the employee to delay the taking of leave until the \n     notice provision is met. See Sec. 825.207(h).\n\n     Sec. 825.602 What limitations apply to the taking of leave \n       near the end of an academic term?\n\n       (a) There are also different rules for instructional \n     employees who begin leave more than five weeks before the end \n     of a term, less than five weeks before the end of a term, and \n     less than three weeks before the end of a term. Regular rules \n     apply except in circumstances when:\n       (1) An instructional employee begins leave more than five \n     weeks before the end of a term. The employing office may \n     require the employee to continue taking leave until the \n     end of the term if--\n       (i) The leave will last at least three weeks, and\n       (ii) The employee would return to work during the three-\n     week period before the end of the term.\n       (2) The employee begins leave for a purpose other than the \n     employee's own serious health condition during the five-week \n     period before the end of a term. The employing office may \n     require the employee to continue taking leave until the end \n     of the term if--\n       (i) The leave will last more than two weeks, and\n       (ii) The employee would return to work during the two-week \n     period before the end of the term.\n       (3) The employee begins leave for a purpose other than the \n     employee's own serious health condition during the three-week \n     period before the end of a term, and the leave will last more \n     than five working days. The employing office may require the \n     employee to continue taking leave until the end of the term.\n       (b) For purposes of these provisions, ``academic term'' \n     means the school semester, which typically ends near the end \n     of the calendar year and the end of spring each school year. \n     In no case may a school have more than two academic terms or \n     semesters each year for purposes of FMLA as made applicable \n     by the CAA. An example of leave falling within these \n     provisions would be where an employee plans two weeks of \n     leave to care for a family member which will begin three \n     weeks before the end of the term. In that situation, the \n     employing office could require the employee to stay out on \n     leave until the end of the term.\n\n     Sec. 825.603 Is all leave taken during ``periods of a \n       particular duration'' counted against the FMLA leave \n       entitlement?\n\n       (a) If an employee chooses to take leave for ``periods of a \n     particular duration'' in the case of intermittent or reduced \n     schedule leave, the entire period of leave taken will count \n     as FMLA leave.\n       (b) In the case of an employee who is required to take \n     leave until the end of an academic term, only the period of \n     leave until the employee is ready and able to return to work \n     shall be charged against the employee's FMLA leave \n     entitlement. The employing office has the option not to \n     require the employee to stay on leave until the end of the \n     school term. Therefore, any additional leave required by the \n     employing office to the end of the school term is not counted \n     as FMLA leave; however, the employing office shall be \n     required to maintain the employee's group health insurance \n     and restore the employee to the same or equivalent job \n     including other benefits at the conclusion of the leave.\n\n     Sec. 825.604 What special rules apply to restoration to ``an \n       equivalent position?''\n\n       The determination of how an employee is to be restored to \n     ``an equivalent position'' upon return from FMLA leave will \n     be made on the basis of ``established school board policies \n     and practices, private school policies and practices, and \n     collective bargaining agreements.'' The ``established \n     policies'' and collective bargaining agreements used as a \n     basis for restoration must be in writing, must be made known \n     to the employee prior to the taking of FMLA leave, and must \n     clearly explain the employee's restoration rights upon return \n     from leave. Any established policy which is used as the basis \n     for restoration of an employee to ``an equivalent position'' \n     must provide substantially the same protections as provided \n     in the FMLA, as made applicable by the CAA, for reinstated \n     employees. See Sec. 825.215. In other words, the policy or \n     collective bargaining agreement must provide for restoration \n     to an ``equivalent position'' with equivalent employment \n     benefits, pay, and other terms and conditions of employment. \n     For example, an employee may not be restored to a position \n     requiring additional licensure or certification.\n\n\n     Subpart G--How Do Other Laws, Employing Office Practices, and \nCollective Bargaining Agreements Affect Employee Rights Under the FMLA \n                     as Made Applicable by the CAA?\n\n     Sec. 825.700 What if an employing office provides more \n       generous benefits than required by FMLA as Made Applicable \n       by the CAA?\n\n       (a) An employing office must observe any employment benefit \n     program or plan that provides greater family or medical leave \n     rights to employees than the rights established by the FMLA. \n     Conversely, the rights established by the FMLA, as made \n     applicable by the CAA, may not be diminished by any \n     employment benefit program or plan. For example, a provision \n     of a CBA which provides for reinstatement to a position that \n     is not equivalent because of seniority (e.g., provides lesser \n     pay) is superseded by FMLA. If an employing office provides \n     greater unpaid family leave rights than are afforded by FMLA, \n     the employing office is not required to extend additional \n     rights afforded by FMLA, such as maintenance of health \n     benefits (other than as may be otherwise required by law), to \n     the additional leave period not covered by FMLA. If an \n     employee takes paid or unpaid leave and the employing office \n     does not designate the leave as FMLA leave, the leave taken \n     does not count against an employee's FMLA entitlement.\n       (b) Nothing in this FMLA, as made applicable by the CAA, \n     prevents an employing office from amending existing leave and \n     employee benefit programs, provided they comply with FMLA as \n     made applicable by the CAA. However, nothing in the FMLA, as \n     made applicable by the CAA, is intended to discourage \n     employing offices from adopting or retaining more generous \n     leave policies.\n       (c) [Reserved.]\n\n     Sec. 825.701 [Reserved.]\n\n     Sec. 825.702 How does FMLA affect anti-discrimination laws as \n       applied by section 201 of the CAA?\n\n       (a) Nothing in FMLA modifies or affects any applicable law \n     prohibiting discrimination on the basis of race, religion, \n     color, national origin, sex, age, or disability (e.g., Title \n     VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, as amended by the \n     Pregnancy Discrimination Act), as made applicable by the CAA. \n     FMLA's legislative history explains that FMLA is ``not \n     intended to modify or affect the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, \n     as amended, the regulations concerning employment which have \n     been promulgated pursuant to that statute, or the Americans \n     with Disabilities Act of 1990, or the regulations issued \n     under that act. Thus, the leave provisions of the [FMLA] are \n     wholly distinct from the reasonable accommodation obligations \n     of employing offices covered under the [ADA] * * * or the \n     Federal government itself. The purpose of the FMLA is to make \n     leave available to eligible employees and employing \n     offices within its coverage, and not to limit already \n     existing rights and protection.'' S. Rep. No. 3, 103d \n     Cong., 1st Sess. 38 (1993). An employing office must \n     therefore provide leave under whichever statutory \n     provision provides the greater rights to employees.\n       (b) If an employee is a qualified individual with a \n     disability within the meaning of the Americans with \n     Disabilities Act (ADA), the employing office must make \n     reasonable accommodations, etc., barring undue hardship, in \n     accordance with the ADA. At the same time, the employing \n     office must afford an employee his or her FMLA rights. ADA's \n     ``disability'' and FMLA's ``serious health condition'' are \n     different concepts, and must be analyzed separately. FMLA \n     entitles eligible employees to 12 weeks of leave in any 12-\n     month period, whereas the ADA allows an indeterminate amount \n     of leave, barring undue hardship, as a reasonable \n     accommodation. FMLA requires employing offices to maintain \n     employees'' group health plan coverage during FMLA leave on \n     the same conditions as coverage would have been provided if \n     the employee had been continuously employed during the leave \n     period, whereas ADA does not require maintenance of health \n     insurance unless other employees receive health insurance \n     during leave under the same circumstances.\n       (c)(1) A reasonable accommodation under the ADA might be \n     accomplished by providing an individual with a disability \n     with a part-time job with no health benefits, assuming the \n     employing office did not ordinarily provide health insurance \n     for part-time employees. However, FMLA would permit an \n     employee to work a reduced leave schedule until the \n     equivalent of 12 workweeks of leave were used, with group \n     health benefits maintained during this period. FMLA permits \n     an employing office to temporarily transfer an employee who \n     is taking leave intermittently or on a reduced leave schedule \n     to an alternative position, whereas the ADA allows an \n     accommodation of reassignment to an equivalent, vacant \n     position only if the employee cannot perform the essential \n     functions of the employee's present position and an \n     accommodation is not possible in the employee's present \n     position, or an accommodation in the employee's present \n     position would cause an undue hardship. The examples in the \n     following paragraphs of this section demonstrate how the two \n     laws would interact with respect to a qualified individual \n     with a disability.\n       (2) A qualified individual with a disability who is also an \n     ``eligible employee'' entitled to FMLA leave requests 10 \n     weeks of medical leave as a reasonable accommodation, which \n\n[[Page S 17649]]\n     the employing office grants because it is not an undue hardship. The \n     employing office advises the employee that the 10 weeks of \n     leave is also being designated as FMLA leave and will count \n     towards the employee's FMLA leave entitlement. This \n     designation does not prevent the parties from also treating \n     the leave as a reasonable accommodation and reinstating the \n     employee into the same job, as required by the ADA, rather \n     than an equivalent position under FMLA, if that is the \n     greater right available to the employee. At the same time, \n     the employee would be entitled under FMLA to have the \n     employing office maintain group health plan coverage during \n     the leave, as that requirement provides the greater right to \n     the employee.\n       (3) If the same employee needed to work part-time (a \n     reduced leave schedule) after returning to his or her same \n     job, the employee would still be entitled under FMLA to have \n     group health plan coverage maintained for the remainder of \n     the two-week equivalent of FMLA leave entitlement, \n     notwithstanding an employing office policy that part-time \n     employees do not receive health insurance. This employee \n     would be entitled under the ADA to reasonable accommodations \n     to enable the employee to perform the essential functions of \n     the part-time position. In addition, because the employee is \n     working a part-time schedule as a reasonable accommodation, \n     the employee would be shielded from FMLA's provision for \n     temporary assignment to a different alternative position. \n     Once the employee has exhausted his or her remaining FMLA \n     leave entitlement while working the reduced (part-time) \n     schedule, if the employee is a qualified individual with a \n     disability, and if the employee is unable to return to the \n     same full-time position at that time, the employee might \n     continue to work part-time as a reasonable accommodation, \n     barring undue hardship; the employee would then be entitled \n     to only those employment benefits ordinarily provided by the \n     employing office to part-time employees.\n       (4) At the end of the FMLA leave entitlement, an employing \n     office is required under FMLA to reinstate the employee in \n     the same or an equivalent position, with equivalent pay and \n     benefits, to that which the employee held when leave \n     commenced. The employing office's FMLA obligations would be \n     satisfied if the employing office offered the employee an \n     equivalent full-time position. If the employee were unable to \n     perform the essential functions of that equivalent position \n     even with reasonable accommodation, because of a disability, \n     the ADA may require the employing office to make a reasonable \n     accommodation at that time by allowing the employee to work \n     part-time or by reassigning the employee to a vacant \n     position, barring undue hardship.\n       (d)(1) If FMLA entitles an employee to leave, an employing \n     office may not, in lieu of FMLA leave entitlement, require an \n     employee to take a job with a reasonable accommodation. \n     However, ADA may require that an employing office offer an \n     employee the opportunity to take such a position. An \n     employing office may not change the essential functions of \n     the job in order to deny FMLA leave. See Sec. 825.220(b).\n       (2) An employee may be on a workers' compensation absence \n     due to an on-the-job injury or illness which also qualifies \n     as a serious health condition under FMLA. The workers' \n     compensation absence and FMLA leave may run concurrently \n     (subject to proper notice and designation by the employing \n     office). At some point the health care provider providing \n     medical care pursuant to the workers' compensation injury may \n     certify the employee is able to return to work in a ``light \n     duty'' position. If the employing office offers such a \n     position, the employee is permitted but not required to \n     accept the position (see Sec. 825.220(d)). As a result, the \n     employee may no longer qualify for payments from the workers' \n     compensation benefit plan, but the employee is entitled to \n     continue on unpaid FMLA leave either until the employee is \n     able to return to the same or equivalent job the employee \n     left or until the 12-week FMLA leave entitlement is \n     exhausted. See Sec. 825.207(d)(2). If the employee returning \n     from the workers' compensation injury is a qualified \n     individual with a disability, he or she will have rights \n     under the ADA.\n       (e) If an employing office requires certifications of an \n     employee's fitness for duty to return to work, as permitted \n     by FMLA under a uniform policy, it must comply with the ADA \n     requirement that a fitness for duty physical be job-related \n     and consistent with business necessity.\n       (f) Under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, as \n     amended by the Pregnancy Discrimination Act, and as made \n     applicable by the CAA, an employing office should provide the \n     same benefits for women who are pregnant as the employing \n     office provides to other employees with short-term \n     disabilities. Because Title VII does not require employees to \n     be employed for a certain period of time to be protected, an \n     employee employed for less than 12 months by the employing \n     office (and, therefore, not an ``eligible'' employee under \n     FMLA) may not be denied maternity leave if the employing \n     office normally provides short-term disability benefits to \n     employees with the same tenure who are experiencing other \n     short-term disabilities.\n       (g) For further information on Federal anti-discrimination \n     laws applied by section 201 of the CAA, including Title VII \n     and the ADA, individuals are encouraged to contact the Office \n     of Compliance.\n\n\n                         Subpart H--Definitions\n\n     Sec. 825.800 Definitions.\n\n        For purposes of this part:\n        ADA means the Americans With Disabilities Act (42 U.S.C. \n     12101 et seq.).\n        CAA means the Congressional Accountability Act of 1995, \n     Pub.

The term does not include non-\n     employment related obligations paid by employees through \n     voluntary deductions such as supplemental insurance coverage. \n     (See Sec. 825.209(a)).\n        FLSA means the Fair Labor Standards Act (29 U.S.C. 201 et \n     seq.).\n        FMLA means the Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993, \n     Public Law 103-3 (February 5, 1993), 107 Stat. 6 (29 U.S.C. \n     2601 et seq.).\n        Group health plan means the Federal Employees Health \n     Benefits Program and any other plan of, or contributed to by, \n     an employing office (including a self-insured plan) to \n     provide health care (directly or otherwise) to the employing \n     office's employees, former employees, or the families of such \n     employees or former employees.

A serious health \n     condition involving continuing treatment by a health care \n     provider includes:\n        (A) A period of incapacity (i.e., inability to work, \n     attend school or perform other regular daily activities due \n     to the serious health condition, treatment therefor, or \n     recovery therefrom) of more than three consecutive calendar \n     days, including any subsequent treatment or period of \n     incapacity relating to the same condition, that also \n     involves: (1) Treatment two or more times by a health care \n     provider, by a nurse or physician's assistant under direct \n     supervision of a health care provider, or by a provider of \n     health care services (e.g., physical therapist) under \n     orders of, or on referral by, a health care provider; or \n     (2) Treatment by a health care provider on at least one \n     occasion which results in a regimen of continuing \n     treatment under the supervision of the health care \n     provider.\n       (B) Any period of incapacity due to pregnancy, or for \n     prenatal care.\n       (C) Any period of incapacity or treatment for such \n     incapacity due to a chronic serious health condition. A \n     chronic serious health condition is one which: (1) Requires \n     periodic visits for treatment by a health care provider, or \n     by a nurse or physician's assistant under direct supervision \n     of a health care provider; (2) Continues over an extended \n     period of time (including recurring episodes of a single \n     underlying condition); and (3) May cause episodic rather than \n     a continuing period of incapacity (e.g., asthma, diabetes, \n     epilepsy, etc.).\n       (D) A period of incapacity which is permanent or long-term \n     due to a condition for which treatment may not be effective. \n     The employee or family member must be under the continuing \n     supervision of, but need not be receiving active treatment \n     by, a health care provider. Examples include Alzheimer's, a \n     severe stroke, or the terminal stages of a disease.\n       (E) Any period of absence to receive multiple treatments \n     (including any period of recovery therefrom) by a health care \n     provider or by a provider of health care services under \n     orders of, or on referral by, a health care provider, either \n     for restorative surgery after an accident or other injury, or \n     for a condition that would likely result in a period of \n     incapacity of more than three consecutive calendar days in \n     the absence of medical intervention or treatment, such as \n     cancer (chemotherapy, radiation, etc.), severe arthritis \n     (physical therapy), kidney disease (dialysis).\n       (2) Treatment for purposes of paragraph (1) of this \n     definition includes (but is not limited to) examinations to \n     determine if a serious health condition exists and \n     evaluations of the condition. Treatment does not include \n     routine physical examinations, eye examinations, or dental \n     examinations. Under paragraph (1)(ii)(A)(2) of this \n     definition, a regimen of continuing treatment includes, for \n     example, a course of prescription medication (e.g., an \n     antibiotic) or therapy requiring special equipment to resolve \n     or alleviate the health condition (e.g., oxygen). A regimen \n     of continuing treatment that includes the taking of over-the-\n     counter medications such as aspirin, antihistamines, or \n     salves; or bed-rest, drinking fluids, exercise, and other \n     similar activities that can be initiated without a visit to a \n     health care provider, is not, by itself, sufficient to \n     constitute a regimen of continuing treatment for purposes of \n     FMLA leave.\n       (3) Conditions for which cosmetic treatments are \n     administered (such as most treatments for acne or plastic \n     surgery) are not ``serious health conditions'' unless \n     inpatient hospital care is required or unless complications \n     develop. Ordinarily, unless complications arise, the common \n     cold, the flu, ear aches, upset stomach, minor ulcers, \n     headaches other than migraine, routine dental or orthodontia \n     problems, periodontal disease, etc., are examples of \n     conditions that do not meet the definition of a serious \n     health condition and do not qualify for FMLA leave. \n     Restorative dental or plastic surgery after an injury or \n     removal of cancerous growths are serious health conditions \n     provided all the other conditions of this regulation are met. \n     Mental illness resulting from stress or allergies may be \n     serious health conditions, but only if all the conditions of \n     this section are met.\n       (4) Substance abuse may be a serious health condition if \n     the conditions of this section are met. However, FMLA leave \n     may only be taken for treatment for substance abuse by a \n     health care provider or by a provider of health care services \n     on referral by a health care provider. On the other hand, \n     absence because of the employee's use of the substance, \n     rather than for treatment, does not qualify for FMLA leave.\n       (5) Absences attributable to incapacity under paragraphs \n     (1)(ii) (B) or (C) of this definition qualify for FMLA leave \n     even though the employee or the immediate family member does \n     not receive treatment from a health care provider during the \n     absence, and even if the absence does not last more than \n     three days. For example, an employee with asthma may be \n     unable to report for work due to the onset of an asthma \n     attack or because the \n\n[[Page S 17651]]\n     employee's health care provider has advised the employee to stay home \n     when the pollen count exceeds a certain level.

The term does not include teacher \n     assistants or aides who do not have as their principal \n     function actual teaching or instructing, nor auxiliary \n     personnel such as counselors, psychologists, curriculum \n     specialists, cafeteria workers, maintenance workers, bus \n     drivers, or other primarily noninstructional employees.\n\n                  Appendix A to Part 825--[Reserved.]\n\n   Appendix B to Part 825--Certification of Physician or Practitioner\n\n\nCertification of Health Care Provider (Family and Medical Leave Act of \n  1993 as Made Applicable by the Congressional Accountability Act of \n                                 1995)\n\n       1.

If medical leave is required for the employee's \n     absence from work because of the employee's own condition \n     (including absences due to pregnancy or a chronic condition), \n     is the employee unable to perform work of any kind? ________\n       b. If able to perform some work, is the employee unable to \n     perform any one or more of the essential functions of the \n     employee's job (the employee or the employer should supply \n     you with information about the essential job functions)? \n     ________ If yes, please list the essential functions the \n     employee is unable to perform:\n       c.

Absence plus treatment.--(a) A period of incapacity \\2\\ \n     of more than three consecutive calendar days (including any \n     subsequent treatment or period of incapacity \\2\\ relating to \n     the same condition), that also involves: (1) Treatment \\3\\ \n     two or more times by a health care provider, by a nurse or \n     physician's assistant under direct supervision of a health \n     care provider, or by a provider of health care services \n     (e.g., physical therapist) under orders of, or on referral \n     by, a health care provider; or (2) Treatment by a health care \n     provider on at least one occasion which results in a regimen \n     of continuing treatment \\4\\ under the supervision of the \n     health care provider.\n     \\3\\ Treatment includes examinations to determine if a serious \n     health condition exists and evaluations of the condition. \n     Treatment does not include routine physical examinations, eye \n     examinations, or dental examinations.\n     \\4\\ A regimen of continuing treatment includes, for example, \n     a course of prescription medication (e.g., an antibiotic) or \n     therapy requiring special equipment to resolve or alleviate \n     the health condition. A regimen of treatment does not include \n     the taking of over-the-counter medications such as aspirin, \n     antihistamines, or salves; or bed-rest, drinking fluids, \n     exercise, and other similar activities that can be initiated \n     without a visit to a health care provider.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n       3.

The requested leave {time}  will {time}  will not be \n     counted against your annual FMLA leave entitlement.\n       3. You {time}  will {time}  will not be required to furnish \n     medical certification of a serious health condition. If \n     required, you must furnish certification by __________ \n     (insert date) (must be at least 15 days after you are \n     notified of this requirement) or we may delay the \n     commencement of your leave until the certification is \n     submitted.\n       4. You may elect to substitute accrued paid leave for \n     unpaid FMLA leave. We {time}  will {time}  will not require \n     that you substitute accrued paid leave for unpaid FMLA leave. \n     If paid leave will be used the following conditions will \n     apply: (Explain)\n       5(a). If you normally pay a portion of the premiums for \n     your health insurance, these payments will continue during \n     the period of FMLA leave. Arrangements for payment have been \n     discussed with you and it is agreed that you will make \n     premium payments as follows: (Set forth dates, e.g., the 10th \n     of each month, or pay periods, etc. that specifically cover \n     the agreement with the employee.)\n       (b). You have a minimum 30-day (or, indicate longer period, \n     if applicable) grace period in which to make premium \n     payments. If payment is not made timely, your group health \n     insurance may be cancelled, provided we notify you in writing \n     at least 15 days before the date that your health coverage \n     will lapse, or, at our option, we may pay your share of the \n     premiums during FMLA leave, and recover these payments from \n     you upon your return to work. We {time}  will {time}  will \n     not pay your share of health insurance premiums while you are \n     on leave.\n       (c).

You {time}  will {time}  will not be required to present \n     a fitness-for-duty certificate prior to being restored to \n     employment.

You {time}  are {time}  are not a ``key employee'' as \n     described in Sec. 825.218 of the Office of Compliance's FMLA \n     regulations. If you are a ``key employee,'' restoration to \n     employment may be denied following FMLA leave on the grounds \n     that such restoration will cause substantial and grievous \n     economic injury to us.\n       (b). We {time}  have {time}  have not determined that \n     restoring you to employment at the conclusion of FMLA leave \n     will cause substantial and grievous economic harm to us. \n     (Explain (a) and/or (b) below.

Sec. 1315, to employees of the House of \n     Representatives, the Senate, and certain Congressional \n     instrumentalities listed below.\n       The CAA applies the rights and protections of eleven labor \n     and employment statutes to covered employees within the \n     legislative branch. Section 205 provides that no employing \n     office (meeting the size thresholds for coverage as an \n     employer) shall be closed or a mass layoff ordered within the \n     meaning of section 3 of the Worker Adjustment and Retraining \n     Notification Act, 29 U.S.C Sec. 2102 (``WARN''), until the \n     end of a 60-day period after the employing office serves \n     written notice of such prospective closing or layoff to \n     representatives of covered employees or, if there are no \n     representatives, to covered employees. 2 U.S.C. Sec. 1315(a). \n     The provisions of section 205 are effective January 23, 1996, \n     one year after the enactment date of the CAA, for all \n     employing offices except the General Accounting Office and \n     the Library of Congress. Accordingly, this notice does not \n     include rules applicable to the General Accounting Office of \n     the Library of Congress.\n       This notice proposes that substantially similar regulations \n     be adopted for the Senate, the House of Representatives, and \n     the seven Congressional instrumentalities; and their \n     employees. Accordingly:\n        (1) Senate.--It is proposed that regulations as described \n     in this notice be included in the body of regulations that \n     shall apply to the Senate and employees of the Senate, and \n     this proposal regarding the Senate and its employees is \n     recommended by the Office of Compliance's Deputy Executive \n     Director for the Senate.\n       (2) House of Representatives.--It is further proposed that \n     regulations as described in this notice be included in the \n     body of regulations that shall apply to the House of \n     Representatives and employees of the House of \n     Representatives, and this proposal regarding the House of \n     Representatives and its employees is recommended by the \n     Office of Compliance's Deputy Executive Director for the \n     House of Representatives.\n       (3) Certain Congressional instrumentalities.--It is further \n     proposed that regulations as described in this notice be \n     included in the body of regulations that shall apply to the \n     Capitol Guide Board, the Capitol Police Board, the \n     Congressional Budget Office, the Office of the Architect of \n     the Capitol, the Office of the Attending Physician, the \n     Office of Compliance, and the Office of Technology \n     Assessment, and their employees; and this proposal regarding \n     these seven Congressional instrumentalities is recommended by \n     the Office of Compliance's Executive Director.\n       Dates: Comments are due within 30 days after the date of \n     publication of this notice in the Congressional Record.\n       Addresses: Submit written comments to the Chair of the \n     Board of Directors, Office of Compliance, Room LA 200, \n     Library of Congress, 110 Second Street, S.E., Washington, \n     D.C. 20540-1999. Those wishing to receive notification of \n     receipt of comments are requested to include a self-\n     addressed, stamped post card. Comments may also be \n     transmitted by facsimile (``FAX'') machine to (202) 252-3115. \n     This is not a toll-free call. Copies of comments submitted by \n     the public will be available for review at the Law Library \n     Reading Room, Room LM-201, Law Library of Congress, James \n     Madison Building, 101 Independence Avenue, S.E., Washington, \n     D.C., Monday through Friday, between the hours of 9:30 a.m. \n     and 4:00 p.m.\n       For further information contact: Executive Director, Office \n     of Compliance, at (202) 252-3100. This notice is also \n     available in the following formats: large print, braille, \n     audio tape, and electronic file on computer disk. Requests \n     for this notice in an alternative format should be made to \n     Mr. Russell Jackson, Director, Service Department, Office of \n     the Sergeant at Arms and Doorkeeper of the Senate, at (202) \n     224-2705.\n       Supplementary information:\n       Background and summary: The Congressional Accountability \n     Act of 1995 (``CAA''), P.L. 104-1, was enacted into law on \n     January 23, 1995. 2 U.S.C. Sec. Sec. 1301 et seq. In general, \n     the CAA applies the rights and protections of eleven federal \n     labor and employment statutes to covered employees and \n     employing offices within the legislative branch. Section 205 \n     of the CAA provides that no employing office shall be closed \n     or a mass layoff ordered within the meaning of section 3 of \n     the Worker Adjustment Retraining and Notification Act of \n     1988, 29 U.S.C. Sec. 2102 (``WARN'') until the end of a 60-\n     day period after the employing office serves written notice \n     of such prospective closing or layoff to representatives of \n     covered employees or, if there are no representatives, to \n     covered employees. 2 U.S.C. Sec. 1315(a). Section 225(f) of \n     the CAA provides that ``[e]xcept where inconsistent with \n     definitions and exemptions provided in this Act, the \n     definitions and exemptions of [WARN] shall apply under this \n     Act.'' 2 U.S.C. Sec. 1361(f). Sections 304(a) and 205(c) of \n     the CAA directs the Board of Directors of the Office of \n     Compliance established under the CAA to issue regulations \n     implementing the section. 2 U.S.C. Sec. Sec. 1384(a), \n     1315(c). Section 205(c) further states that such regulations \n     ``shall be the same as substantive regulations issued by the \n     Secretary of Labor to implement the statutory provisions \n     referred to in subsections (a) and (b) except insofar as the \n     Board may determine, for good cause shown and stated together \n     with the regulation, that a modification of such regulations \n     would be more effective for the implementation of the rights \n     and protections under this section.'' 2 U.S.C. Sec. 1315(c).\n       The Board has published in the Congressional Record for \n     comment an Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking. See 141 \n     Cong. Rec. S14542 (daily ed., Sept. 28, 1995). After \n     consideration of the public comments relating to rulemaking \n     under section 205 of the \n\n[[Page S 17653]]\n     CAA, the Board is publishing this proposed regulation.\n       With the exception of technical and nomenclature changes, \n     the Board does not propose substantial departure from \n     otherwise applicable Secretary's regulations. See Secretary \n     of Labor's regulations at 20 C.F.R. Part 639; Final rule \n     published at 54 Federal Register 16042 (April 20, 1989).\n       In developing these proposed regulations, a number of \n     issues have been identified and explored. The Board proposes \n     to resolve these issues as described below, and it \n     particularly invites comments on the following issues:\n        1. Employer coverage.--WARN contains size thresholds for \n     coverage as an employer and specifies which workers are \n     counted in making coverage determinations. Section 225(f)(2) \n     of the CAA makes clear that the provisions of WARN \n     determining coverage based on size shall apply in determining \n     coverage of employing offices under the CAA. 2 U.S.C. \n     Sec. 1361(f)(2). Thus, the Secretary's regulations \n     implementing WARN's coverage requirements (20 C.F.R. \n     Sec. 639.3(a)) are included in these regulations.\n       2. Notification of State dislocated worker assistance \n     programs and coordination with job placement and retraining \n     programs.--In contrast to section 3 of WARN, section 205 of \n     the CAA does not require an employing office to give notice \n     of the office closing or layoff to the ``State dislocated \n     worker unit'' or to the ``chief elected official of the unit \n     of local government'' within which such closing or layoff is \n     to occur. See 29 U.S.C. Sec. 2102(a)(2). Therefore, the \n     proposed regulations do not require notice to be given to \n     State and local entities and do not include the Secretary's \n     regulations regarding such notice.\n       3. Exemption for strikes and lockouts.-- The proposed \n     regulations do not include the Secretary's regulations \n     regarding WARN's exemption for strikes and lockouts (20 \n     C.F.R. Sec. 639.5). Strikes are prohibited in federal \n     employment. 18 U.S.C. Sec. 1918. Similarly, the Federal Labor \n     Relations Act, which applies to covered employees and \n     employing offices under section 220 of the CAA, prohibits \n     picketing that interferes with agency operations, as well as \n     slowdowns, stoppages and strikes under any circumstances. 5 \n     U.S.C. Sec. 7116(b)(7). Therefore, these regulations are \n     inapplicable to legislative branch employees.\n       4. ``Faltering company'' exemption.--Section 3(b) of WARN \n     sets forth three conditions under which the notification \n     period may be reduced to less than 60 days. Under the \n     ``faltering company'' exemption, an employer must be in the \n     process of seeking capital or business during the time that \n     the 60-day notice would have been required. This section is \n     inapplicable to employment within the legislative branch and \n     the Secretary's regulation implementing this section (20 \n     C.F.R. Sec. 639.9(a)) is not included in the proposed \n     regulations. The ``unforeseen business circumstances'' and \n     ``natural disaster'' exceptions in sections 3(b)(2)(A) and \n     (B) of WARN, appear to be applicable and thus the Secretary's \n     regulations (29 C.F.R. Sec. 639.9(b) and (c)) have been \n     included in the proposed regulations, with appropriate \n     modifications.\n       5. Extension of short-term layoff.--The Secretary's \n     regulations address the Notice requirement where an employer \n     extends short-term layoffs (6 months or less) beyond 6 months \n     due to business circumstances (including unforeseeable \n     changes in price or cost) not reasonably foreseeable at the \n     time the initial layoff is required. 20 C.F.R. Sec. 639.4(b). \n     There may be circumstances where an employing office may be \n     required to extend short-term layoffs due to unforeseen \n     events (such as unforeseen budget or funding reductions or \n     eliminations). Therefore, the Board includes this provision \n     (with appropriate modification as part of its proposed \n     regulations.\n       6. Sale of business.--The Board includes the Secretary's \n     regulations regarding Notice in the case of a sale of all or \n     parts of a business (20 C.F.R. Sec. 639.4(c)).\n       Recommended Method of Approval: The Board recommends that \n     (1) the version of the proposed regulations that shall apply \n     to the Senate and employees of the Senate be approved by the \n     Senate by resolution; (2) the version of the proposed \n     regulations that apply to the House of Representatives and \n     employees of the House of Representatives be approved by the \n     House of Representatives by resolution; and (3) the version \n     of the proposed regulations that shall apply to other covered \n     employees and employing offices be approved by the Congress \n     by concurrent resolution.\n       Signed at Washington, D.C., on this 20th day of November, \n     1995.\n                                                    Glen D.

Sec. 2102. \n     Advance notice provides workers and their families some \n     transition time to adjust to the prospective loss of \n     employment, to seek and obtain alternative jobs and, if \n     necessary, to enter skill training or retraining that will \n     allow these workers to successfully compete in the job \n     market. As used in these regulations, WARN shall refer to the \n     provisions of WARN applied to covered employing offices by \n     section 205 of the CAA.\n       (b) Scope of these regulations.--These regulations \n     establish basic definitions and rules for giving notice, \n     implementing the provisions of WARN. The objective of these \n     regulations is to establish clear principles and broad \n     guidelines which can be applied in specific circumstances. \n     However, it is recognized that rulemaking cannot address the \n     multitude of employing office-specific situations in which \n     advance notice will be given.\n       (c) Notice encouraged where not required.--An employing \n     office that is not required to comply with the notice \n     requirements of section 205 of the CAA is encouraged, to the \n     extent possible, to provide notice to its employees about a \n     proposal to close an office or permanently reduce its \n     workforce.\n       (d) Notice in ambiguous situations.--It is civically \n     desirable and it would appear to be good business practice \n     for an employing office to provide advance notice to its \n     workers or unions when terminating a significant number of \n     employees. In practical terms, there are some questions and \n     ambiguities of interpretation inherent in the application of \n     WARN that cannot be addressed in these regulations. It is \n     therefore prudent for employing offices to weigh the \n     desirability of advance notice against the possibility of \n     expensive and time-consuming litigation to resolve disputes \n     where notice has not been given. The Office encourages \n     employing offices to give notice in all circumstances.\n       (e) WARN not to supersede other laws and contracts.--The \n     provisions of WARN do not supersede any otherwise applicable \n     laws or collective bargaining agreements that provide for \n     additional notice or additional rights and remedies. If such \n     law or agreement provides for a longer notice period, WARN \n     notice shall run concurrently with that additional notice \n     period. Collective bargaining agreements may be used to \n     clarify or amplify the terms and conditions of WARN, but may \n     not reduce WARN rights.\n\n     Sec. 639.2 What does WARN require?\n\n       WARN requires employing offices that are planning an office \n     closing or a mass layoff to give affected employees at least \n     60 days' notice of such an employment action. While the 60-\n     day period is the minimum for advance notice, this provision \n     is not intended to discourage employing offices from \n     voluntarily providing longer periods of advance notice. Not \n     all office closings and layoffs are subject to WARN, and \n     certain employment thresholds must be reached before WARN \n     applies. WARN sets out specific exemptions, and provides for \n     a reduction in the notification period in particular \n     circumstances. Remedies authorized under section 205 of the \n     CAA may be assessed against employing offices that violate \n     WARN requirements.\n\n     Sec. 639.3 Definitions.\n\n       (a) Employing office.--(1) The term ``employing office'' \n     means any business enterprise that employs--\n       (i) 100 or more employees, excluding part-time employees; \n     or\n       (ii) employs 100 or more employees, including part-time \n     employees, who in the aggregate work at least 4,000 hours per \n     week, exclusive of overtime.\n\n     Workers on temporary layoff or on leave who have a reasonable \n     expectation of recall are counted as employees. An employee \n     has a ``reasonable expectation of recall'' when he/she \n     understands, through notification or through common practice, \n     that his/her employment with the employer has been \n     temporarily interrupted and that he/she will be recalled to \n     the same or to a similar job.\n       (2) Workers, other than part-time workers, who are exempt \n     from notice under section 4 of WARN, are nonetheless counted \n     as employees for purposes of determining coverage as an \n     employer.\n       (3) An employing office may have one or more sites of \n     employment under common ownership or control.\n       (b) Office closing.--The term ``office closing'' means the \n     permanent or temporary shutdown of a ``single site of \n     employment'', or one or more ``facilities or operating \n     units'' within a single site of employment, if the shutdown \n     results in an ``employment loss'' during any 30-day period at \n     the single site of employment for 50 or more employees, \n     excluding any part-time employees. An employment action that \n     results in the effective cessation of the work performed by a \n     unit, even if a few employees remain, is a shutdown. A \n     ``temporary shutdown'' triggers the notice requirement only \n     if there are a sufficient number of terminations, layoffs \n     exceeding 6 months, or reductions in hours of work as \n     specified under the definition of ``employment loss.''\n       (c) Mass layoff.--(1) The term ``mass layoff'' means a \n     reduction in force which first, is not the result of an \n     office closing, and second, results in an employment loss at \n     the \n\n[[Page S 17654]]\n     single site of employment during any 30-day period for:\n       (i) At least 33 percent of the active employees, excluding \n     part-time employees, and\n       (ii) At least 50 employees, excluding part-time employees.\n\n     Where 500 or more employees (excluding part-time employees) \n     are affected, the 33% requirement does not apply, and notice \n     is required if the other criteria are met. Office closings \n     involve employment loss which results from the shutdown of \n     one or more distinct units within a single site or the entire \n     site. A mass layoff involves employment loss, regardless of \n     whether one or more units are shut down at the site.\n       (2) Workers, other than part-time workers, who are exempt \n     from notice under section 4 of WARN are nonetheless counted \n     as employees for purposes of determining coverage as an \n     office closing or mass layoff. For example, if an employer \n     closes a temporary project on which 10 permanent and 40 \n     temporary workers are employed, a covered office closing has \n     occurred although only 10 workers are entitled to notice.\n       (d) Representative.--The term ``representative'' means an \n     exclusive representative of employees within the meaning of 5 \n     U.S.C. Sec. Sec. 7101 et seq., as applied to covered \n     employees and employing offices by section 220 of the CAA, 2 \n     U.S.C. Sec. 1351.\n       (e) Affected employees.--The term ``affected employees'' \n     means employees who may reasonably be expected to experience \n     an employment loss as a consequence of a proposed plant \n     closing or mass layoff by their employer. This includes \n     individually identifiable employees who will likely lose \n     their jobs because of bumping rights or other factors, to the \n     extent that such individual workers reasonably can be \n     identified at the time notice is required to be given. The \n     term ``affected employees'' includes managerial and \n     supervisory employees. Consultant or contract employees who \n     have a separate employment relationship with another \n     employing office or employer and are paid by that other \n     employing office or employer, or who are self-employed, are \n     not ``affected employees'' of the business to which they are \n     assigned. In addition, for purposes of determining whether \n     coverage thresholds are met, either incumbent workers in jobs \n     being eliminated or, if known 60 days in advance, the actual \n     employees who suffer an employment loss may be counted.\n       (f) Employment loss.--(1) The term ``employment loss'' \n     means (i) an employment termination, other than a discharge \n     for cause, voluntary departure, or retirement, (ii) a layoff \n     exceeding 6 months, or (iii) a reduction in hours of work of \n     individual employees of more than 50% during each month of \n     any 6-month period.\n       (2) Where a termination or a layoff (see paragraphs \n     (f)(1)(i) and (ii) of this section) is involved, an \n     employment loss does not occur when an employee is reassigned \n     or transferred to employing office-sponsored programs, such \n     as retraining or job search activities, as long as the \n     reassignment does not constitute a constructive discharge or \n     other involuntary termination.\n       (3) An employee is not considered to have experienced an \n     employment loss if the closing or layoff is the result of the \n     relocation or consolidation of part or all of the employing \n     office's operations and, prior to the closing or layoff--\n       (i) The employing office offers to transfer the employee to \n     a different site of employment within a reasonable commuting \n     distance with no more than a 6-month break in employment, or\n       (ii) The employing office offers to transfer the employee \n     to any other site of employment regardless of distance with \n     no more than a 6-month break in employment, and the employee \n     accepts within 30 days of the offer or of the closing or \n     layoff, whichever is later.\n       (4) A ``relocation or consolidation'' of part or all of an \n     employing office's operations, for purposes of paragraph \n     Sec. 639.3(f)(3), means that some definable operations are \n     transferred to a different site of employment and that \n     transfer results in an office closing or mass layoff.\n       (g) Part-time employee.--The term ``part-time'' employee \n     means an employee who is employed for an average of fewer \n     than 20 hours per week or who has been employed for fewer \n     than 6 of the 12 months preceding the date on which notice is \n     required, including workers who work full-time. This term may \n     include workers who would traditionally be understood as \n     ``seasonal'' employees. The period to be used for calculating \n     whether a worker has worked ``an average of fewer than 20 \n     hours per week'' is the shorter of the actual time the worker \n     has been employed or the most recent 90 days.\n       (h) Single site of employment.--(1) A single site of \n     employment can refer to either a single location or a group \n     of contiguous locations. Separate facilities across the \n     street from one another may be considered a single site of \n     employment.\n       (2) There may be several single sites of employment within \n     a single building, such as an office building, if separate \n     employing offices conduct activities within such a building. \n     For example, an office building housing 50 different \n     employing offices will contain 50 single sites of employment. \n     The offices of each employing office will be its single site \n     of employment.\n       (3) Separate buildings or areas which are not directly \n     connected or in immediate proximity may be considered a \n     single site of employment if they are in reasonable \n     geographic proximity, used for the same purpose, and share \n     the same staff and equipment.\n       (4) Non-contiguous sites in the same geographic area which \n     do not share the same staff or operational purpose should not \n     be considered a single site.\n       (5) Contiguous buildings operated by the same employing \n     office which have separate management and have separate \n     workforces are considered separate single sites of \n     employment.\n       (6) For workers whose primary duties require travel from \n     point to point, who are outstationed, or whose primary duties \n     involve work outside any of the employing office's regular \n     employment sites (e.g., railroad workers, bus drivers, \n     salespersons), the single site of employment to which they \n     are assigned as their home base, from which their work is \n     assigned, or to which they report will be the single site in \n     which they are covered for WARN purposes.\n       (7) Foreign sites of employment are not covered under WARN. \n     U.S. workers at such sites are counted to determine whether \n     an employing office is covered as an employer under \n     Sec. 639.3(a).\n       (8) The term ``single site of employment'' may also apply \n     to truly unusual organizational situations where the above \n     criteria do not reasonably apply. The application of this \n     definition with the intent to evade the purpose of WARN to \n     provide notice is not acceptable.\n       (i) Facility or operating unit.--The term ``facility'' \n     refers to a building or buildings. The term ``operating \n     unit'' refers to an organizationally or operationally \n     distinct product, operation, or specific work function within \n     or across facilities at the single site.\n\n     Sec. 639.4 Who must give notice?\n\n       Section 205(a)(1) of the CAA states that ``[n]o employing \n     office shall be closed or a mass layoff ordered within the \n     meaning of section 3 of [WARN] until the end of a 60-day \n     period after the employer serves written notice of such \n     prospective closing or layoff * * *.'' Therefore, an \n     employing office that is anticipating carrying out an office \n     closing or mass layoff is required to give notice to affected \n     employees or their representative(s). (See definitions in \n     Sec. 639.3 of this part.).\n       (a) It is the responsibility of the employing office to \n     decide the most appropriate person within the employing \n     office's organization to prepare and deliver the notice to \n     affected employees or their representative(s). In most \n     instances, this may be the local site office manager, the \n     local personnel director or a labor relations officer.\n       (b) An employing office that has previously announced and \n     carried out a short-term layoff (6 months or less) which is \n     being extended beyond 6 months due to business circumstances \n     not reasonably foreseeable at the time of the initial layoff \n     is required to give notice when it becomes reasonably \n     foreseeable that the extension is required. A layoff \n     extending beyond 6 months from the date the layoff commenced \n     for any other reason shall be treated as an employment loss \n     from the date of its commencement.\n       (c) In the case of the sale of part or all of a business, \n     section 2(b)(1) of WARN, as applied by the CAA, defines who \n     the ``employer'' is. The seller is responsible for providing \n     notice of any plant closing or mass layoff which takes place \n     up to and including the effective date (time) of the sale, \n     and the buyer is responsible for providing notice of any \n     office closing or mass layoff that takes place thereafter. \n     Affected employees are always entitled to notice; at all \n     times the employer is responsible for providing notice.\n       (1) If the seller is made aware of any definite plans on \n     the part of the buyer to carry out an office closing or mass \n     layoff within 60 days of purchase, the seller may give notice \n     to affected employees as an agent of the buyer, if so \n     empowered. If the seller does not give notice, the buyer is, \n     nevertheless, responsible to give notice. If the seller gives \n     notice as the buyer's agent, the responsibility for notice \n     still remains with the buyer.\n       (2) It may be prudent for the buyer and seller to determine \n     the impacts of the sale on workers, and to arrange between \n     them for advance notice to be given to affected employees or \n     their representative(s), if a mass layoff or office closing \n     is planned.\n\n     Sec. 639.5 When must notice be given?\n\n        (a) General rule.--(1) With certain exceptions discussed \n     in paragraphs (b), (c) and (d) of this section and in \n     Sec. 639.9 of this part, notice must be given at least 60 \n     calendar days prior to any planned office closing or mass \n     layoff, as defined in these regulations. When all employees \n     are not terminated on the same date, the date of the first \n     individual termination within the statutory 30-day or 90-day \n     period triggers the 60-day notice requirement. A worker's \n     last day of employment is considered the date of that \n     worker's layoff. The first and each subsequent group of \n     terminees are entitled to a full 60 days' notice. In order \n     for an employer to decide whether issuing notice is required, \n     the employer should--\n        (i) Look ahead 30 days and behind 30 days to determine \n     whether employment actions both taken and planned will, in \n     the aggregate for any 30-day period, reach the minimum \n     numbers for an office closing or a mass layoff and thus \n     trigger the notice requirement; and\n        (ii) Look ahead 90 days and behind 90 days to determine \n     whether employment actions \n\n[[Page S 17655]]\n     both taken and planned each of which separately is not of sufficient \n     size to trigger WARN coverage will, in the aggregate for any \n     90-day period, reach the minimum numbers for an office \n     closings or a mass layoff and thus trigger the notice \n     requirement. An employing office is not, however, required \n     under section 3(d) to give notice if the employing office \n     demonstrates that the separate employment losses are the \n     result of separate and distinct actions and causes, and are \n     not an attempt to evade the requirements of WARN.\n        (2) The point in time at which the number of employees is \n     to be measured for the purpose of determining coverage is the \n     date the first notice is required to be given. If this \n     ``snapshot'' of the number of employees employed on that date \n     is clearly unrepresentative of the ordinary or average \n     employment level, then a more representative number can be \n     used to determine coverage. Examples of unrepresentative \n     employment levels include cases when the level is near the \n     peak or trough of an employment cycle or when large upward or \n     downward shifts in the number of employees occur around the \n     time notice is to be given. A more representative number may \n     be an average number of employees over a recent period of \n     time or the number of employees on an alternative date which \n     is more representative of normal employment levels. \n     Alternative methods cannot be used to evade the purpose of \n     WARN, and should only be used in unusual circumstances.\n        (b) Transfers.--(1) Notice is not required in certain \n     cases involving transfers, as described under the definition \n     of ``employment loss'' at Sec. 639.3(f) of this part.\n        (2) An offer of reassignment to a different site of \n     employment should not be deemed to be a ``transfer'' if the \n     new job constitutes a constructive discharge.\n        (3) The meaning of the term ``reasonable commuting \n     distance'' will vary with local conditions. In determining \n     what is a ``reasonable commuting distance,'' consideration \n     should be given to the following factors: geographic \n     accessibility of the place of work, the quality of the roads, \n     customarily available transportation, and the usual travel \n     time.\n        (4) In cases where the transfer is beyond reasonable \n     commuting distance, the employing office may become liable \n     for failure to give notice if an offer to transfer is not \n     accepted within 30 days of the offer or of the closing or \n     layoff (whichever is later). Depending upon when the offer of \n     transfer was made by the employing office, the normal 60-day \n     notice period may have expired and the office closing or mass \n     layoff may have occurred. An employing office is, therefore, \n     well advised to provide 60-day advance notice as part of the \n     transfer offer.\n        (c) Temporary employment.--(1) No notice is required if \n     the closing is of a temporary facility, or if the closing or \n     layoff is the result of the completion of a particular \n     project or undertaking, and the affected employees were hired \n     with the understanding that their employment was limited to \n     the duration of the facility or the project or undertaking.\n        (2) Employees must clearly understand at the time of hire \n     that their employment is temporary. When such understandings \n     exist will be determined by reference to employment \n     contracts, collective bargaining agreements, or employment \n     practices of an industry or a locality, but the burden of \n     proof will lie with the employing office to show that the \n     temporary nature of the project or facility was clearly \n     communicated should questions arise regarding the temporary \n     employment understandings.\n\n     Sec. 639.6 Who must receive notice?\n\n        Section 3(a) of WARN provides for notice to each \n     representative of the affected employees as of the time \n     notice is required to be given or, if there is no such \n     representative at that time, to each affected employee.\n        (a) Representative(s) of affected employees.--Written \n     notice is to be served upon the chief elected officer of the \n     exclusive representative(s) or bargaining agent(s) of \n     affected employees at the time of the notice. If this person \n     is not the same as the officer of the local union(s) \n     representing affected employees, it is recommended that a \n     copy also be given to the local union official(s).\n        (b) Affected employees.--Notice is required to be given to \n     employees who may reasonably be expected to experience an \n     employment loss. This includes employees who will likely lose \n     their jobs because of bumping rights or other factors, to the \n     extent that such workers can be identified at the time notice \n     is required to be given. If, at the time notice is required \n     to be given, the employing office cannot identify the \n     employee who may reasonably be expected to experience an \n     employment loss due to the elimination of a particular \n     position, the employing office must provide notice to the \n     incumbent in that position. While part-time employees are not \n     counted in determining whether office closing or mass layoff \n     thresholds are reached, such workers are due notice.\n\n     Sec. 639.7 What must the notice contain?\n\n       (a) Notice must be specific.--(1) All notice must be \n     specific.\n       (2) Where voluntary notice has been given more than 60 days \n     in advance, but does not contain all of the required elements \n     set out in this section, the employer must ensure that all of \n     the information required by this section is provided in \n     writing to the parties listed in Sec. 639.6 at least 60 days \n     in advance of a covered employment action.\n       (3) Notice may be given conditional upon the occurrence or \n     nonoccurrence of an event, such as the renewal of a major \n     contract, only when the event is definite and the \n     consequences of its occurrence or nonoccurrence will \n     necessarily, in the normal course of business, lead to a \n     covered office closing or mass layoff less than 60 days after \n     the event. The notice must contain each of the elements set \n     out in this section.\n       (4) The information provided in the notice shall be based \n     on the best information available to the employing office at \n     the time the notice is served. It is not the intent of the \n     regulations that errors in the information provided in a \n     notice that occur because events subsequently change or that \n     are minor, inadvertent errors are to be the basis for finding \n     a violation of WARN.\n       (b) As used in this section, the term ``date'' refers to a \n     specific date or to a 14-day period during which a separation \n     or separations are expected to occur. If separations are \n     planned according to a schedule, the schedule should indicate \n     the specific dates on which or the beginning date of each 14-\n     day period during which any separations are expected to \n     occur. Where a 14-day period is used, notice must be given at \n     least 60 days in advance of the first day of the period.\n       (c) Notice to each representative of affected employees is \n     to contain:\n       (1) The name and address of the employment site where the \n     office closing or mass layoff will occur, and the name and \n     telephone number of a company official to contact for further \n     information;\n       (2) A statement as to whether the planned action is \n     expected to be permanent or temporary and, if the entire \n     office is to be closed, a statement to that effect;\n       (3) The expected date of the first separation and the \n     anticipated schedule for making separations;\n       (4) The job titles of positions to be affected and the \n     names of the workers currently holding affected jobs.\n       The notice may include additional information useful to the \n     employees such as information on available dislocated worker \n     assistance, and, if the planned action is expected to be \n     temporary, the estimated duration, if known.\n       (d) Notice to each affected employee who does not have a \n     representative is to be written in language understandable to \n     the employees and is to contain:\n       (1) A statement as to whether the planned action is \n     expected to be permanent or temporary and, if the entire \n     office is to be closed, a statement to that effect;\n       (2) The expected date when the office closing or mass \n     layoff will commence and the expected date when the \n     individual employee will be separated;\n       (3) An indication whether or not bumping rights exist;\n       (4) The name and telephone number of a company official to \n     contact for further information.\n       The notice may include additional information useful to the \n     employees such as information on available dislocated worker \n     assistance, and, if the planned action is expected to be \n     temporary, the estimated duration, if known.\n\n     Sec. 639.8 How is the notice served?\n\n       Any reasonable method of delivery to the parties listed \n     under Sec. 639.6 of this part which is designed to ensure \n     receipt of notice of at least 60 days before separation is \n     acceptable (e.g., first class mail, personal delivery with \n     optional signed receipt). In the case of notification \n     directly to affected employees, insertion of notice into pay \n     envelopes is another viable option. A ticketed notice, i.e., \n     preprinted notice regularly included in each employee's pay \n     check or pay envelope, does not meet the requirements of \n     WARN.\n\n     Sec. 639.9 When may notice be given less than 60 days in \n       advance?\n\n       Section 3(b) of WARN, applied by section 205 of the CAA, \n     sets forth two conditions under which the notification period \n     may be reduced to less than 60 days. The employing office \n     bears the burden of proof that conditions for the exception \n     have been met. If one of the exceptions is applicable, the \n     employing office must give as much notice as is practicable \n     to the union and non-represented employees and this may, in \n     some circumstances, be notice after the fact. The employing \n     office must, at the time notice actually is given, provide a \n     brief statement of the reason for reducing the notice period, \n     in addition to the other elements set out in Sec. 639.7.\n       (a) The ``unforeseeable business circumstances'' exception \n     under section 3(b)(2)(A) of WARN, as applied under the CAA, \n     applies to office closings and mass layoffs caused by \n     circumstances that were not reasonably foreseeable at the \n     time that 60-day notice would have been required.\n       (1) An important indicator of a circumstance that is not \n     reasonably foreseeable is that the circumstance is caused by \n     some sudden, dramatic, and unexpected action or condition \n     outside the employing office's control.\n       (2) The test for determining when circumstances are not \n     reasonably foreseeable focuses on an employing office's \n     business judgment. The employing office must exercise such \n     reasonable business judgment as would a similarly situated \n     employing office in predicting the demands of its operations. \n     The employing office is not required, however, to accurately \n     predict general economic conditions that also may affect its \n     operations.\n       (b) The ``natural disaster'' exception in section \n     3(b)(2)(B) of WARN applies to office \n\n[[Page S 17656]]\n     closings and mass layoffs due to any form of a natural disaster.\n       (1) Floods, earthquakes, droughts, storms, tidal waves or \n     tsunamis and similar effects of nature are natural disasters \n     under this provision.\n       (2) To qualify for this exception, an employing office must \n     be able to demonstrate that its office closing or mass layoff \n     is a direct result of a natural disaster.\n       (3) While a disaster may preclude full or any advance \n     notice, such notice as is practicable, containing as much of \n     the information required in Sec. 639.7 as is available in the \n     circumstances of the disaster still must be given, whether in \n     advance or after the fact of an employment loss caused by a \n     natural disaster.\n       (4) Where an office closing or mass layoff occurs as an \n     indirect result of a natural disaster, the exception does not \n     apply but the ``unforeseeable business circumstance'' \n     exception described in paragraph (a) of this section may be \n     applicable.\n\n     Sec. 639.10 When may notice be extended?\n\n       Additional notice is required when the date or schedule of \n     dates of a planned office closing or mass layoff is extended \n     beyond the date or the ending date of any 14-day period \n     announced in the original notice as follows:\n       (a) If the postponement is for less than 60 days, the \n     additional notice should be given as soon as possible to the \n     parties identified in Sec. 639.6 and should include reference \n     to the earlier notice, the date (or 14-day period) to which \n     the planned action is postponed, and the reasons for the \n     postponement. The notice should be given in a manner which \n     will provide the information to all affected employees.\n       (b) If the postponement is for 60 days or more, the \n     additional notice should be treated as new notice subject to \n     the provisions of Sec. Sec. 639.5, 639.6, and 639.7 of this \n     part. Rolling notice, in the sense of routine periodic \n     notice, given whether or not an office closing or mass layoff \n     is impending, and with the intent to evade the purpose of the \n     Act rather than give specific notice as required by WARN, is \n     not acceptable.\n\n\n                          office of compliance\n\n       The Congressional Accountability Act of 1995: Extension of \n     Rights and Protections Under the Employee Polygraph \n     Protection Act of 1988\n\n                     Notice of proposed rulemaking\n\n       Summary: The Board of Directors of the Office of Compliance \n     is publishing proposed regulations to implement Sections 204 \n     (a) and (b) of the Congressional Accountability Act of 1995 \n     (``CAA'') to employees of the House of Representatives, the \n     Senate, and certain Congressional instrumentalities listed \n     below.\n       The CAA applies the rights and protections of eleven labor \n     and employment and statutes to covered employees within the \n     legislative branch. Section 204(a) provides that no employing \n     may require any covered employee (including a covered \n     employee who does not work in that employing office) to take \n     a lie detector test where such test would be prohibited if \n     required by an employer under paragraphs (1), (2) or (3) of \n     section 3 of the Employee Polygraph Protection Act of 1988 \n     (``EPPA''), 29 U.S.C. Sec. 2002 (1), (2) or (3). 2 U.S.C. \n     Sec. 1314(a). Section 204(a) of the CAA also applies the \n     waiver provision of section 6(d) of the EPPA (29 U.S.C. \n     Sec. 2005(d)) to covered employees. Id. The provisions of \n     section 204 are effective January 23, 1996, one year after \n     the enactment date of the CAA, for all employing offices \n     except the General Accounting Office and the Library of \n     Congress. 2 U.S.C. Sec. 1314(d). Accordingly, this notice \n     does not include rules applicable to the General Accounting \n     Office or the Library of Congress.\n       The purpose of these regulations is to implement section \n     204 of the CAA, which provides protection for most covered \n     employees from lie detector testing, either pre-employment or \n     during the course of employment, with certain limited \n     exceptions. This notice proposes that substantially similar \n     regulations be adopted for the Senate, the House of \n     Representatives, and the seven Congressional \n     instrumentalities; and their employees. Accordingly:\n       (1) Senate. It is proposed that regulations as described in \n     this notice be included in the body of regulations that shall \n     apply to the Senate and employees of the Senate, and this \n     proposal regarding the Senate and its employees is \n     recommended by the Office of Compliance's Deputy Executive \n     Director for the Senate.\n       (2) House of Representatives. It is further proposed that \n     regulations as described in this notice be included in the \n     body of regulations that shall apply to the House of \n     Representatives and employees of the House of \n     Representatives, and this proposal regarding the House of \n     Representatives and its employees is recommended by the \n     Office of Compliance's Deputy Executive Director for the \n     House of Representatives.\n       (3) Certain Congressional instrumentalities. It is further \n     proposed that regulations as described in this notice be \n     included in the body of regulations that shall apply to the \n     Capitol Guide Board, the Capitol Police Board, the \n     Congressional Budget Office, the Office of the Architect of \n     the Capitol, the Office of the Attending Physician, the \n     Office of Compliance, and the Office of Technology \n     Assessment, and their employees; and this proposal regarding \n     these seven Congressional instrumentalities is recommended by \n     the Office of Compliance's Executive Director.\n       Dates: Comments are due within 30 days after the date of \n     publication of this notice in the Congressional Record.\n       Addresses: Submit written comments to the Chair of the \n     Board of Directors, Office of Compliance, Room LA 200, \n     Library of Congress, 110 Second Street, S.E., Washington, \n     D.C. 20540-1999. Those wishing to receive notification of \n     receipt of comments are requested to include a self-\n     addressed, stamped post card. Comments may also be \n     transmitted by facsimile (``FAX'') machine to (202) 252-3115. \n     This is not a toll-free call. Copies of comments submitted by \n     the public will be available for review at the Law Library \n     Reading Room, Room LM-201, Law Library of Congress, James \n     Madison Building, 101 Independence Avenue, S.E., Washington, \n     D.C., Monday through Friday, between the hours of 9:30 a.m. \n     and 4:00 p.m.\n       For further information contact: Executive Director, Office \n     of Compliance, at (202) 252-3100. This notice is also \n     available in the following formats: large print, braille, \n     audio tape, and electronic file on computer disk. Requests \n     for this notice in an alternative format should be made to \n     Mr. Russell Jackson, Director, Services Department, Office of \n     the Sergeant at Arms and Doorkeeper of the Senate, at (202) \n     244-2705.\n       Supplementary information:\n\n                         Background and summary\n\n       The Congressional Accountability Act of 1995 (``CAA''), \n     P.L. 104-1, 109 Stat. 3, was enacted on January 23, 1995. 2 \n     U.S.C. Sec. Sec. 1301-1438. In general, the CAA applies the \n     rights and protections of eleven federal labor and employment \n     and public access statutes to covered employees and employing \n     offices within the legislative branch. Section 204(a) of the \n     CAA provides that no employing office may require any covered \n     employee (including a covered employee who does not work in \n     that employing office) to take a lie detector test where such \n     test would be prohibited if required by an employer under \n     paragraphs (1), (2) or (3) of section 3 of the Employee \n     Polygraph Protection Act of 1988, 29 U.S.C. Sec. 2002 (1), \n     (2) or (3) (``EPPA''). 2 U.S.C. Sec. 1314(a). Section 204(a) \n     of the EPPA also applies the waiver provisions of section \n     6(d) of the EPPA (29 U.S.C. Sec. 2005(d)) to covered \n     employees. Id. Section 225(f) of the CAA provides that, \n     ``[e]xcept where inconsistent with definitions and exemptions \n     provided in this Act, the definitions and exemptions of the \n     [EPPA] shall apply under this Act.'' 2 U.S.C. \n     Sec. 1361(f)(1). Section 204(c) of the CAA requires the Board \n     of Directors of the Office of Compliance established under \n     the CAA to issue regulations implementing the section. 2 \n     U.S.C. Sec. 1314(c). Section 204(c) further states that such \n     regulations ``shall be the same as substantive regulations \n     promulgated by the Secretary of Labor to implement the \n     statutory provisions referred to in subsections (a) and (b) \n     except insofar as the Board may determine, for good cause \n     shown and stated together with the regulation, that a \n     modification of such regulations would be more effective for \n     the implementation of the rights and protections under this \n     section.'' Id.\n       The regulations in this Part are divided into three \n     subparts. Subpart A contains the provisions generally \n     applicable to covered employing offices, including the \n     requirements relating to the prohibitions on lie detector \n     use. Subpart B sets forth rules regarding the statutory \n     exemptions from application of the rights and protections of \n     the EPPA. Subpart C sets forth the restrictions on lie \n     detector usage under such exemptions. Subpart D sets forth \n     the rules on recordkeeping and the disclosure of polygraph \n     test information.\n       In preparing the proposed regulations, the Board has \n     considered the comments submitted in response to the Board's \n     general Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking published at \n     141 Cong. Rec. S14542 (daily ed. Sept. 28, 1995), regarding \n     regulations that the Board should issue in this area. In \n     developing these proposed Regulations, a number of issues \n     have been identified and explored. The Board proposes to \n     resolve these issues as described below, and it particularly \n     invites comments on the following issues:\n       (1) Notice posting and recordkeeping requirements. The CAA \n     incorporates only the prohibitions on the use of lie detector \n     tests contained in paragraphs (1), (2) and (3) of section 3 \n     of the EPPA (prohibiting use of lie detectors subject to \n     limited exceptions), the waiver provisions of section 6(d) of \n     the EPPA, the civil action remedies provision of section \n     6(c)(1) of the EPPA, and the exemptions and definitions of \n     the EPPA (to the extent appropriate and not inconsistent with \n     exemptions and definitions in the CAA). See sections 204(a), \n     (b) and 225(f) of the CAA, 2 U.S.C. Sec. Sec. 1314(a), (b) \n     and 1361(f)(1). As a result, the provisions of sections 4 \n     (directing the Secretary to prepare a notice of the \n     provisions of the EPPA and requiring employers to post such \n     notices), and 5 (authorizing the Secretary to issue \n     regulations, make investigations and require recordkeeping) \n     of the EPPA, 29 U.S.C. Sec. Sec. 2003, 2004, are not \n     incorporated into the CAA.\n       On September 28, 1995, the Board issued an Advance Notice \n     of Proposed Rulemaking (``ANPR'') for publication in the \n     Congressional Record which invited comments regarding whether \n     and to what extent the Board should impose notice posting and \n     recordkeeping requirements on employing offices. After \n     considering the comments received, the Board has concluded \n     that the CAA does not incorporate the notice and \n     recordkeeping requirements of the EPPA and that, as a \n     consequence, such requirements \n\n[[Page S 17657]]\n     may not be imposed at this time under the ``good cause'' provision \n     under section 204(c). See Notice of Proposed Rulemaking on \n     the Fair Labor Standards Act submitted concurrently with this \n     notice.\n       The EPPA does contain specific recordkeeping requirements \n     which are included in sections of the EPPA applied by the \n     CAA. Section 8 of the EPPA, 29 U.S.C. Sec. 2007, which sets \n     forth the restrictions on the use of exemptions under the \n     EPPA, requires any employer conducting a polygraph test under \n     the ongoing investigations exemption (which is incorporated \n     into the CAA under section 225(f)(1)) to provide a signed a \n     statement to the examinee setting forth the factual basis for \n     testing the particular employees, a copy of which is retained \n     by the employer for at least 3 years. 29 U.S.C. \n     Sec. 2006(d)(4)(C). The portions of the Secretary's \n     regulations requiring such recordkeeping (29 C.F.R. \n     Sec. Sec. 801.12, 801.26, and 801.30) have been included in \n     the proposed regulations (Sections 1.12, 1.26, and 1.30), but \n     only to the extent that such regulatory provisions are \n     derived from section 8 of the EPPA.\n       (2) Administrative enforcement. The CAA does not \n     incorporate Section 6(a) and (b) of the EPPA (providing for \n     civil penalties in an administrative enforcement scheme and \n     an administrative civil penalty remedy), 29 U.S.C. Sec. 2005. \n     A civil action in federal court or an administrative claim \n     before the Board (following counseling and mediation) is the \n     exclusive means by which covered employees may enforce their \n     EPPA rights and protections. See sections 401-416 of the CAA, \n     2 U.S.C. Sec. Sec. 1401-1416. Therefore, the proposed \n     regulations, consistent with the terms of Section 204 of the \n     CAA, exclude any reference to the Secretary's authority to \n     make investigations and initiate enforcement actions. \n     Consistent with section 204(c)(1) of the CAA, 2 U.S.C. \n     Sec. 1314(c)(1), the proposed regulations state that the \n     Board has authority to issue regulations under this section.\n       (3) Exemptions. Section 225(f) of the CAA, 2 U.S.C. \n     Sec. 1361(f), provides that ``[e]xcept where inconsistent \n     with definitions and exemptions provided in this Act, the \n     definitions and exemptions in the laws made applicable by \n     this Act shall apply under this Act.''\n       (a) Exemption for security services and drug security, drug \n     theft, or drug diversion investigations. Section 7(e) of the \n     EPPA, 29 U.S.C. Sec. 2006(e), provides an exemption \n     authorizing the use of polygraph tests, but no other types of \n     lie detector tests, by certain armored car, security alarm, \n     and security guard employers. Section 7(e) is limited by its \n     terms to private employers and the Board is not aware of any \n     employing office whose functions would meet the requirements \n     of the section 7(e) exemption. Therefore, the Board has not \n     included the Secretary's regulations implementing section \n     7(e) (29 C.F.R. Sec. 801.14) as part of its proposed \n     regulations.\n       Section 7(f) of the EPPA allows certain employers \n     authorized to manufacture, distribute, or dispense controlled \n     substances to use polygraph tests, but no other types of lie \n     detector tests, under certain circumstances. There may be \n     entities within the legislative branch, such as the Office of \n     the Attending Physician, that might have employees whose \n     duties meet the drug security, drug theft or drug diversion \n     investigations exemption. Therefore, the Board's proposed \n     regulation (at section 1.13, infra) includes a modified \n     version of the Secretary's regulations under the drug \n     security, drug theft or drug diversion investigations \n     exemption (29 C.F.R. Sec. 801.13) as part of its proposed \n     regulations.\n       (b) Exemption for national defense and security. Section \n     7(b) of the EPPA, 29 U.S.C. Sec. 2006(b), provides, among \n     other things, that nothing in the EPPA shall be construed to \n     prohibit the administration of any lie detector test by the \n     Federal Government, in the performance of any intelligence or \n     counterintelligence functions, to certain employees whose \n     duties involve access to information classified at the level \n     of top secret or designated as being within a special access \n     program under 4.2(a) of Executive Order 12356 (or a successor \n     Executive Order). There may be some employing offices within \n     the legislative branch, such as intelligence committees, that \n     have employees whose duties meet the exemption under section \n     7(b) of the EPPA. Therefore, the Board proposes a modified \n     version of the Secretary's regulations implementing such \n     exemption (29 C.F.R. Sec. 801.11) in its proposed \n     regulations.\n       (c) FBI contractor exemption. Section 7(c) of the EPPA, 29 \n     U.S.C. Sec. 2006(c), exempts Federal Bureau of Investigation \n     contractors from the requirements of the EPPA under certain \n     circumstances. This provision has no apparent applicability \n     to employing offices. Therefore, the Board does not include \n     the Secretary's regulations implementing this provision (29 \n     C.F.R. Sec. 801.11(e)) as part of its proposed regulations.\n       (d) Limited exemption for ongoing investigations. Section \n     7(d) of the EPPA, 29 U.S.C. Sec. 2006(d), provides a limited \n     exemption permitting polygraph tests, but no other types of \n     lie detector tests, in the context of employer investigations \n     involving economic loss or injury to the employer's business, \n     such as theft, embezzlement, misappropriation, or an act of \n     unlawful industrial espionage or sabotage. The Board believes \n     that there may be situations where an employing office may be \n     able to meet the exemption under section 7(d). Accordingly, \n     the Board includes the Secretary's regulations implementing \n     this exemption (29 C.F.R. Sec. 801.12) as part of its \n     proposed regulations.\n       (e) Exemption for employees of the Capitol Police. By \n     Notice of Proposed Rulemaking published September 28, 1995 in \n     the Congressional Record, the Board recommended regulations \n     authorizing the Capitol Police to use lie detector tests in \n     certain circumstances. After both appropriate consideration \n     of comments received and further deliberation about the \n     matter, the Board has determined to incorporate such \n     regulations into these proposed regulations. However, this \n     proposed rule adds new section 1.4(e) to make clear it \n     that the regulation excluding the Capitol Police from \n     section 204 of the CAA with respect to its own employees \n     is not a total exemption of the Capitol Police from the \n     prohibitions on the employment-related use of lie detector \n     tests by the Capitol Police. Specifically, section 1.4(e) \n     provides that the Capitol Police may not require covered \n     employees other than Capitol Police employees to take a \n     lie detector test except in circumstances where the \n     Capitol Police administers a lie detector test during the \n     course of an ``ongoing investigation'' by the Capitol \n     Police. This additional language makes clear the Board's \n     intent to prohibit employing offices other than the \n     Capitol Police from administering lie detector tests on \n     their covered employees indirectly through the Capitol \n     Police.\n       (4) Restrictions on use of exemptions. Section 204(a) \n     provides that no employing office may require a covered \n     employee to take a lie detector test where an employer would \n     be prohibited from requiring such a test under paragraphs \n     (1), (2) or (3) of section 3 of the EPPA, 29 U.S.C. \n     Sec. 2002(1), (2) or (3). Section 3 of the EPPA provides \n     that, except as provided in sections 7 and 8 of the EPPA (29 \n     U.S.C. Sec. Sec. 2006 and 2007), it shall be unlawful for an \n     employer to require a lie detector test under paragraphs (1), \n     (2) or (3). Thus, the restrictions on the use of exemptions \n     under 29 U.S.C. Sec. 2007 are incorporated into section 204 \n     and the Secretary's regulations implementing this section (29 \n     C.F.R. Subpart C) are included in the Board's proposed \n     regulations.\n       (5) Confidentiality provisions and notice to examinees. \n     Section 204 of the CAA incorporates the restrictions on \n     disclosure set forth in section 9 of the EPPA, 29 U.S.C. \n     Sec. 2008, since such restrictions are the conditions on \n     which polygraphs are allowed under the exemptions of section \n     7 of the EPPA. Accordingly, the Board includes in its \n     proposed regulations (with appropriate modifications) the \n     Secretary of Labor's regulations regarding restrictions on \n     disclosure of polygraph information (29 C.F.R. Sec. 801.35). \n     See section 225(f)(1) of the CAA (except where inconsistent \n     with definitions and exemptions provided in the CAA, the \n     definitions and exemptions under the laws made applicable by \n     the CAA apply under the CAA). For the same reasons, the Board \n     includes in its proposed regulations the requirement of the \n     Secretary's regulations that employing offices authorized to \n     conduct polygraph tests under the exemptions established in \n     these regulations to give written notice to the examinee of \n     the confidentiality and other requirements.\n       (6) Technical and nomenclature changes. The proposed \n     regulations make technical and nomenclature changes, where \n     appropriate, to conform to the provisions of the CAA. See, \n     e.g., 29 C.F.R. Sec. Sec. 801.1 (Purpose and scope), 801.2 \n     (Definitions), 801.3 (Coverage).\n     Recommended method of approval\n       The Board recommends that (1) the version of the proposed \n     regulations that shall apply to the Senate and employees of \n     the Senate be approved by the Senate by resolution; (2) the \n     version of the proposed regulations that shall apply to the \n     House of Representatives and employees of the House of \n     Representatives be approved by the House of Representatives \n     by resolution; and (3) the version of the proposed \n     regulations that shall apply to other covered employees and \n     employing offices be approved by the Congress by concurrent \n     resolution.\n       Signed at Washington, D.C., on this 20th day of November, \n     1995\n\n                                                Glen D.

Section 204(a) of the CAA, 2 U.S.C. \n     Sec. 1314(a) provides that no employing office may require \n     any covered employee (including a covered employee who does \n     not work in that employing office) to take a lie detector \n     test where such test would be prohibited if required by an \n     employer under paragraphs (1), (2) or (3) of section 3 of the \n     Employee Polygraph Protection Act of 1988 (EPPA) 29 U.S.C. \n     Sec. 2002(1), (2) or (3). The purpose of this part is to set \n     forth the regulations to carry out the provisions of Section \n     204 of the CAA.\n       Subpart A contains the provisions generally applicable to \n     covered employers, including the requirements relating to the \n     prohibitions on lie detector use. Subpart B sets forth rules \n     regarding the statutory exemptions from application of \n     section 204 of the CAA. Subpart C sets forth the restrictions \n     on polygraph usage under such exemptions. Subpart D sets \n     forth the rules on recordkeeping and the disclosure of \n     polygraph test information.\n     Sec. 1.2 Definitions\n       For purposes of this part:\n       (a) Act or CAA means the Congressional Accountability Act \n     of 1995 (P.L. 104-1, 109 Stat. 3, 2 U.S.C. Sec. Sec. 1301-\n     1438).\n       (b) EPPA means the Employee Polygraph Protection Act of \n     1988 (Pub. L. 100-347, 102 Stat. 646, 29 U.S.C. \n     Sec. Sec. 2001-2009) as applied to covered employees and \n     employing offices by Section 204 of the CAA.\n       (c) The term covered employee means any employee of (1) the \n     House of Representatives; (2) the Senate; (3) the Capitol \n     Guide Service; (4) the Congressional Budget Office; (5) the \n     Office of the Architect of the Capitol; (6) the Office of the \n     Attending Physician; (7) the Office of Compliance; or (8) the \n     Office of Technology Assessment.\n       (d) The term employee includes an applicant for employment \n     and a former employee.\n       (e) The term employee of the Office of the Architect of the \n     Capitol includes any employee of the Office of the Architect \n     of the Capitol, the Botanic Gardens, or the Senate \n     Restaurants.\n       (f) The term employee of the Capitol Police includes any \n     member or officer of the Capitol Police.\n       (g) The term employee of the House of Representatives \n     includes an individual occupying a position the pay for which \n     is disbursed by the Clerk of the House of Representatives, or \n     another official designated by the House of Representatives, \n     or any employment position in an entity that is paid with \n     funds derived from the clerk-hire allowance of the House of \n     Representatives but not any such individual employed by any \n     entity listed in subparagraphs (3) through (8) of paragraph \n     (c) above.\n       (h) The term employee of the Senate includes any employee \n     whose pay is disbursed by the Secretary of the Senate, but \n     not any such individual employed by any entity listed in \n     subparagraphs (3) through (8) of paragraph (c) above.\n       (i) The term employing office means (1) the personal office \n     of a Member of the House of Representatives or of a Senator; \n     (2) a committee of the House of Representatives or the Senate \n     or a joint committee; (3) any other office headed by a person \n     with the final authority to appoint, hire, discharge, and set \n     the terms, conditions, or privileges of the employment of an \n     employee of the House of Representatives or the Senate; or \n     (4) the Capitol Guide Board, the Congressional Budget Office, \n     the Office of the Architect of the Capitol, the Office of the \n     Attending Physician, the Office of Compliance, and the Office \n     of Technology Assessment. The term employing office includes \n     any person acting directly or indirectly in the interest of \n     an employing office in relation to an employee or prospective \n     employee. A polygraph examiner either employed for or whose \n     services are retained for the sole purpose of administering \n     polygraph tests ordinarily would not be deemed an employing \n     office with respect to the examinees. Any reference to \n     ``employer'' in these regulations includes employing offices.\n       (j)(1) The term lie detector means a polygraph, \n     deceptograph, voice stress analyzer, psychological stress \n     evaluator, or any other similar device (whether mechanical or \n     electrical) that is used, or the results of which are used, \n     for the purpose of rendering a diagnostic opinion regarding \n     the honesty or dishonesty of an individual. Voice stress \n     analyzers, or psychological stress evaluators, include any \n     systems that utilize voice stress analysis, whether or not an \n     opinion on honesty or dishonesty is specifically rendered.\n       (2) The term lie detector does not include medical tests \n     used to determine the presence or absence of controlled \n     substances or alcohol in bodily fluids. Also not included in \n     the definition of lie detector are written or oral tests \n     commonly referred to as ``honesty'' or ``paper and pencil'' \n     tests, machine-scored or otherwise; and graphology tests \n     commonly referred to as handwriting tests.\n       (k) The term polygraph means an instrument that--\n       (1) Records continuously, visually, permanently, and \n     simultaneously changes in cardiovascular, respiratory, and \n     electrodermal patterns as minimum instrumentation standards; \n     and\n       (2) Is used, or the results of which are used, for the \n     purpose of rendering a diagnostic opinion regarding the \n     honesty or dishonesty of an individual.\n       (l) Board means the Board of Directors of the Office of \n     Compliance.\n       (m) Office means the Office of Compliance.\n     Sec. 1.3 Coverage\n       The coverage of Section 204 of the Act extends to any \n     ``covered employee'' or ``covered employing office'' without \n     regard to the number of employees or the employing office's \n     effect on interstate commerce.\n     Sec. 1.4 Prohibitions on lie detector use\n       (a) Section 204 of the CAA provides that, subject to the \n     exemptions of the EPPA incorporated into the CAA under \n     section 225(f) of the CAA, as set forth in Sec. 1.10 through \n     1.12 of this Part, employing offices are prohibited from: (1) \n     Requiring, requesting, suggesting or causing, directly or \n     indirectly, any covered employee or prospective employee to \n     take or submit to a lie detector test; (2) Using, accepting, \n     or inquiring about the results of a lie detector test of any \n     covered employee or prospective employee; and (3) \n     Discharging, disciplining, discriminating \n\n[[Page S 17659]]\n     against, denying employment or promotion, or threatening any covered \n     employee or prospective employee to take such action for \n     refusal or failure to take or submit to such test, or on the \n     basis of the results of a test. The above prohibitions apply \n     irrespective of whether the covered employee referred to in \n     paragraphs (1), (2) or (3), above, works in that employing \n     office.\n        (b) An employing office that reports a theft or other \n     incident involving economic loss to police or other law \n     enforcement authorities is not engaged in conduct subject to \n     the prohibitions under paragraph (a) of this section if, \n     during the normal course of a subsequent investigation, such \n     authorities deem it necessary to administer a polygraph test \n     to a covered employee(s) suspected of involvement in the \n     reported incident. Employing offices that cooperate with \n     police authorities during the course of their investigations \n     into criminal misconduct are likewise not deemed engaged in \n     prohibitive conduct provided that such cooperation is passive \n     in nature. For example, it is not uncommon for police \n     authorities to request employees suspected of theft or \n     criminal activity to submit to a polygraph test during the \n     employee's tour of duty since, as a general rule, suspect \n     employees are often difficult to locate away from their place \n     of employment. Allowing a test on the employing office's \n     premises, releasing a covered employee during working hours \n     to take a test at police headquarters, and other similar \n     types of cooperation at the request of the police authorities \n     would not be construed as ``requiring, requesting, \n     suggesting, or causing, directly or indirectly, any covered \n     employee * * * to take or submit to a lie detector test.'' \n     Cooperation of this type must be distinguished from actual \n     participation in the testing of employees suspected of \n     wrongdoing, either through the administration of a test by \n     the employing office at the request or direction of police \n     authorities, or through reimbursement by the employing office \n     of tests administered by police authorities to employees. In \n     some communities, it may be a practice of police authorities \n     to request testing by employing offices of employees \n     before a police investigation is initiated on a reported \n     incident. In other communities, police examiners are \n     available to covered employing offices, on a cost \n     reimbursement basis, to conduct tests on employees \n     suspected by an employing office of wrongdoing. All such \n     conduct on the part of employing offices is deemed within \n     the prohibitions of section 204 of the CAA.\n       (c) The receipt by an employing office of information from \n     a polygraph test administered by police authorities pursuant \n     to an investigation is prohibited by section 3(2) of the \n     EPPA. (See paragraph (a)(2) of this section.)\n       (d) The simulated use of a polygraph instrument so as to \n     lead an individual to believe that an actual test is being or \n     may be performed (e.g., to elicit confessions or admissions \n     of guilt) constitutes conduct prohibited by paragraph (a) of \n     this section. Such use includes the connection of a covered \n     employee or prospective employee to the instrument without \n     any intention of a diagnostic purpose, the placement of the \n     instrument in a room used for interrogation unconnected to \n     the covered employee or prospective employee, or the mere \n     suggestion that the instrument may be used during the course \n     of the interview.\n       (e) The Capitol Police may not require a covered employee \n     not employed by the Capitol Police to take a lie detector \n     test (on its own initiative or at the request of another \n     employing office) except where the Capitol Police administers \n     such lie detector test as part of an ``ongoing \n     investigation'' by the Capitol Police. For the purpose of \n     this subsection, the definition of ``ongoing investigation'' \n     contained section 1.12(b) shall apply.\n     Sec. 1.5 Effect on other laws or agreements\n       (a) Section 204 of the CAA does not preempt any otherwise \n     applicable provision of federal law or any rule or regulation \n     of the House or Senate or any negotiated collective \n     bargaining agreement that prohibits lie detector tests or is \n     more restrictive with respect to the use of lie detector \n     tests.\n       (b)(1) This provision applies to all aspects of the use of \n     lie detector tests, including procedural safeguards, the use \n     of test results, the rights and remedies provided examinees, \n     and the rights, remedies, and responsibilities of examiners \n     and employing offices. (2) For example, a collective \n     bargaining agreement that provides greater protection to an \n     examinee would apply in addition to the protection provided \n     in section 204 of the CAA.\n     Sec. 1.6 Notice of protection\n       Pursuant to section 301(h) of the CAA, the Office shall \n     prepare, in a manner suitable for posting, a notice \n     explaining the provisions of section 204 of the CAA. Copies \n     of such notice may be obtained from the Office of Compliance.\n     Sec. 1.7 Authority of the Board\n       Pursuant to sections 204 and 304 of the CAA, the Board is \n     authorized to issue regulations to implement the rights and \n     protections of the EPPA.\n     Sec. 1.8 Employment relationship\n       Subject to the exemptions incorporated into the CAA by \n     section 225(f), section 204 applies the prohibitions on the \n     use of lie detectors by employing offices with respect to \n     covered employees irrespective of whether a covered employee \n     works in that employing office. Sections 101 (3), (4) and 204 \n     of the CAA also apply EPPA prohibitions against \n     discrimination to applicants for employment and former \n     employees of a covered employing office. For example, an \n     employee may quit rather than take a lie detector test. The \n     employing office cannot discriminate or threaten to \n     discriminate in any manner against that person (such as by \n     providing bad references in the future) because of that \n     person's refusal to be tested. Similarly, an employing office \n     cannot discriminate or threaten to discriminate in any manner \n     against that person because that person files a complaint, \n     institutes a proceeding, testifies in a proceeding, or \n     exercises any right under section 204 of the CAA. (See \n     section 207 of the CAA.)\n\n\n                         Subpart B--Exemptions\n\n     Sec. 1.10 Exclusion for employees of the Capitol Police\n       [Reserved]\n     Sec. 1.11 Exemption for national defense and security\n       (a) The exemptions allowing for the administration of lie \n     detector tests in the following paragraphs (b) through (e) of \n     this section apply only to the Federal Government; they do \n     not allow covered employing offices to administer such tests. \n     For the purposes of this section, the term ``Federal \n     Government'' means any agency or entity within the Federal \n     Government authorized to administer polygraph examinations \n     which is otherwise exempt from coverage under section 7(a) of \n     the EPPA, 29 U.S.C. Sec. 2006(a).\n       (b) Section 7(b)(2)(B) of the EPPA, incorporated into the \n     CAA under section 225(f) of the CAA, provides that nothing in \n     the EPPA shall be construed to prohibit the administration of \n     any lie detector test by the Federal Government, in the \n     performance of any intelligence or counterintelligence \n     function, to any covered employee whose duties involve access \n     to information that has been classified at the level of top \n     secret or designated as being within a special access program \n     under section 4.2 (a) of Executive Order 12356 (or a \n     successor Executive Order).\n       (c) Counterintelligence for purposes of the above \n     paragraphs means information gathered and activities \n     conducted to protect against espionage and other clandestine \n     intelligence activities, sabotage, terrorist activities, or \n     assassinations conducted for or on behalf of foreign \n     governments, or foreign or domestic organizations or persons.\n       (d) Lie detector tests of persons described in the above \n     paragraphs will be administered in accordance with applicable \n     Department of Defense directives and regulations, or other \n     regulations and directives governing the use of such tests by \n     the United States Government, as applicable.\n     Sec. 1.12 Exemption for employing offices conducting \n         investigations of economic loss or injury\n       (a) Section 7(d) of the EPPA, incorporated into the CAA \n     under section 225(f) of the CAA, provides a limited exemption \n     from the general prohibition on lie detector use for \n     employers conducting ongoing investigations of economic loss \n     or injury to the employer's business. An employing office may \n     request an employee, subject to the conditions set forth in \n     sections 8 and 10 of the EPPA and Secs. 1.20, 1.22, 1.23, \n     1.24, 1.25, 1.26 and 1.35 of this part, to submit to a \n     polygraph test, but no other type of lie detector test, only \n     if--\n       (1) The test is administered in connection with an ongoing \n     investigation involving economic loss or injury to the \n     employing office's business, such as theft, embezzlement, \n     misappropriation or an act of unlawful industrial espionage \n     or sabotage;\n       (2) The employee had access to the property that is the \n     subject of the investigation;\n       (3) The employing office has a reasonable suspicion that \n     the employee was involved in the incident or activity under \n     investigation;\n       (4) The employing office provides the examinee with a \n     statement, in a language understood by the examinee, prior to \n     the test which fully explains with particularity the specific \n     incident or activity being investigated and the basis for \n     testing particular employees and which contains, at a \n     minimum:\n       (i) An identification with particularity of the specific \n     economic loss or injury to the business of the employing \n     office;\n       (ii) A description of the employee's access to the property \n     that is the subject of the investigation;\n       (iii) A description in detail of the basis of the employing \n     office's reasonable suspicion that the employee was involved \n     in the incident or activity under investigation; and\n       (iv) Signature of a person (other than a polygraph \n     examiner) authorized to legally bind the employing office; \n     and\n       (5) The employing office retains a copy of the statement \n     and proof of service described in paragraph (a)(4) of this \n     section for at least 3 years.\n       (b) For the exemption to apply, the condition of an \n     ``ongoing investigation'' must be met. As used in section \n     7(d) of the EPPA, the ongoing investigation must be of a \n     specific incident or activity. Thus, for example, an \n     employing office may not request that an employee or \n     employees submit to a polygraph test in an effort to \n     determine whether or not any thefts have occurred. Such \n     random testing by an employing office is precluded by the \n     EPPA. Further, because the exemption is limited to a specific \n     incident or activity, an employing office is precluded from \n     using the exemption in situations where the so-called \n     ``ongoing investigation'' is continuous. For example, the \n     fact that \n\n[[Page S 17660]]\n     items in inventory are frequently missing from a warehouse would not be \n     a sufficient basis, standing alone, for administering a \n     polygraph test. Even if the employing office can establish \n     that unusually high amounts of inventory are missing from the \n     warehouse in a given month, this, in and of itself, would not \n     be a sufficient basis to meet the specific incident \n     requirement. On the other hand, polygraph testing in response \n     to inventory shortages would be permitted where additional \n     evidence is obtained through subsequent investigation of \n     specific items missing through intentional wrongdoing, and a \n     reasonable suspicion that the employee to be polygraphed was \n     involved in the incident under investigation. Administering a \n     polygraph test in circumstances where the missing inventory \n     is merely unspecified, statistical shortages, without \n     identification of a specific incident or activity that \n     produced the inventory shortages and a ``reasonable suspicion \n     that the employee was involved,'' would amount to little more \n     than a fishing expedition and is prohibited by the EPPA as \n     applied to covered employees and employing offices by the \n     CAA.\n       (c)(1)(i) The terms economic loss or injury to the \n     employer's business include both direct and indirect economic \n     loss or injury.\n       (ii) Direct loss or injury includes losses or injuries \n     resulting from theft, embezzlement, misappropriation, \n     industrial espionage or sabotage. These examples, cited in \n     the EPPA, are intended to be illustrative and not exhaustive. \n     Another specific incident which would constitute direct \n     economic loss or injury is the misappropriation of \n     confidential or trade secret information.\n       (iii) Indirect loss or injury includes the use of an \n     employer's business to commit a crime, such as check-kiting \n     or money laundering. In such cases, the ongoing investigation \n     must be limited to criminal activity that has already \n     occurred, and to use of the employing office's business \n     operations (and not simply the use of the premises) for such \n     activity. For example, the use of an employing office's \n     vehicles, warehouses, computers or equipment to smuggle or \n     facilitate the importing of illegal substances constitutes an \n     indirect loss or injury to the employing office's business \n     operations. Conversely, the mere fact that an illegal act \n     occurs on the employing office's premises (such as a drug \n     transaction that takes place in the employer's parking lot or \n     rest room) does not constitute an indirect economic loss or \n     injury to the employing office.\n       (iv) Indirect loss or injury also includes theft or injury \n     to property of another for which the employing office \n     exercises fiduciary, managerial or security responsibility, \n     or where the office has custody of the property (but not \n     property of other offices to which the employees have access \n     by virtue of the business relationship). For example, if a \n     maintenance employee of the manager of an apartment \n     building steals jewelry from a tenant's apartment, the \n     theft results in an indirect economic loss or injury to \n     the employer because of the manager's management \n     responsibility with respect to the tenant's apartment. A \n     messenger on a delivery of confidential business reports \n     for a client firm who steals the reports causes an \n     indirect economic loss or injury to the messenger service \n     because the messenger service is custodian of the client \n     firm's reports, and therefore is responsible for their \n     security. Similarly, the theft of property protected by a \n     security service employer is considered an economic loss \n     or injury to that employer.\n       (v) A theft or injury to a client firm does not constitute \n     an indirect loss or injury to an employer unless that \n     employer has custody of, or management, or security \n     responsibility for, the property of the client that was lost \n     or stolen or injured. For example, a cleaning contractor has \n     no responsibility for the money at a client bank. If money is \n     stolen from the bank by one of the cleaning contractor's \n     employees, the cleaning contractor does not suffer an \n     indirect loss or injury.\n       (vi) Indirect loss or injury does not include loss or \n     injury which is merely threatened or potential, e.g., a \n     threatened or potential loss of an advantageous business \n     relationship.\n       (2) Economic losses or injuries which are the result of \n     unintentional or lawful conduct would not serve as a basis \n     for the administration of a polygraph test. Thus, apparently \n     unintentional losses or injuries stemming from truck, car, \n     workplace, or other similar type accidents or routine \n     inventory or cash register shortages would not meet the \n     economic loss or injury requirement. Any economic loss \n     incident to lawful union or employee activity also would not \n     satisfy this requirement.\n       (3) It is the business of the employer which must suffer \n     the economic loss or injury. Thus, a theft committed by one \n     employee against another employee of the same employer would \n     not satisfy the requirement.\n       (d) While nothing in the EPPA as applied by the CAA \n     prohibits the use of medical tests to determine the presence \n     of controlled substances or alcohol in bodily fluids, the \n     section 7(d) exemption of the EPPA does not permit the use of \n     a polygraph test to learn whether an employee has used drugs \n     or alcohol, even where such possible use may have contributed \n     to an economic loss to the employer (e.g., an accident \n     involving a company vehicle).\n       (e) Section 7(d)(2) of the EPPA provides that, as a \n     condition for the use of the exemption, the employee must \n     have had access to the property that is the subject of the \n     investigation.\n        (1) The word access, as used in section 7(d)(2), refers to \n     the opportunity which an employee had to cause, or to aid or \n     abet in causing, the specific economic loss or injury under \n     investigation. The term ``access'', thus, includes more than \n     direct or physical contact during the course of employment. \n     For example, as a general matter, all employees working in or \n     with authority to enter a warehouse storage area have \n     ``access'' to unsecured property in the warehouse. All \n     employees with the combination to a safe have ``access'' to \n     the property in a locked safe. Employees also have ``access'' \n     who have the ability to divert possession or otherwise affect \n     the disposition of the property that is the subject of \n     investigation. For example, a bookkeeper in a jewelry store \n     with access to inventory records may aid or abet a clerk who \n     steals an expensive watch by removing the watch from the \n     employer's inventory records. In such a situation, it is \n     clear that the bookkeeper effectively has ``access'' to the \n     property that is the subject of the investigation.\n       (2) As used in section 7(d)(2), property refers to \n     specifically identifiable property, but also includes such \n     things of value as security codes and computer data, and \n     proprietary, financial or technical information, such as \n     trade secrets, which by its availability to competitors or \n     others would cause economic harm to the employer.\n       (f)(1) As used in section 7(d)(3), the term reasonable \n     suspicion refers to an observable, articulable basis in fact \n     which indicates that a particular employee was involved in, \n     or responsible for, an economic loss. Access in the sense of \n     possible or potential opportunity, standing alone, does not \n     constitute a basis for ``reasonable suspicion.'' Information \n     from a co-worker, or an employee's behavior, demeanor, or \n     conduct may be factors in the basis for reasonable suspicion. \n     Likewise, inconsistencies between facts, claims, or \n     statements that surface during an investigation can serve as \n     a sufficient basis for reasonable suspicion. While access or \n     opportunity, standing alone, does not constitute a basis for \n     reasonable suspicion, the totality of circumstances \n     surrounding the access or opportunity (such as its \n     unauthorized or unusual nature or the fact that access was \n     limited to a single individual) may constitute a factor in \n     determining whether there is a reasonable suspicion.\n       (2) For example, in an investigation of a theft of an \n     expensive piece of jewelry, an employee authorized to open \n     the establishment's safe no earlier than 9 a.m., in order to \n     place the jewelry in a window display case, is observed \n     opening the safe at 7:30 a.m. In such a situation, the \n     opening of the safe by the employee one and one-half hours \n     prior to the specified time may serve as the basis for \n     reasonable suspicion. On the other hand, in the example \n     given, if the employer asked the employee to bring the piece \n     of jewelry to his or her office at 7:30 a.m., and the \n     employee then opened the safe and reported the jewelry \n     missing, such access, standing alone, would not constitute a \n     basis for reasonable suspicion that the employee was involved \n     in the incident unless access to the safe was limited solely \n     to the employee. If no one other than the employee possessed \n     the combination to the safe, and all other possible \n     explanations for the loss are ruled out, such as a break-in, \n     the employer may formulate a basis for reasonable suspicion \n     based on sole access by one employee.\n       (3) The employer has the burden of establishing that the \n     specific individual or individuals to be tested are \n     ``reasonably suspected'' of involvement in the specific \n     economic loss or injury for the requirement in section \n     7(d)(3) of the EPPA to be met.\n       (g)(1) As discussed in paragraph (a)(4) of this section, \n     section 7(d)(4) of the EPPA sets forth what information, at a \n     minimum, must be provided to an employee if the employer \n     wishes to claim the exemption.\n       (2) The statement required under paragraph (a)(4) of this \n     section must be received by the employee at least 48 hours, \n     excluding weekend days and holidays, prior to the time of the \n     examination. The statement must set forth the time and date \n     of receipt by the employee and be verified by the employee's \n     signature. This will provide the employee with adequate pre-\n     test notice of the specific incident or activity being \n     investigated and afford the employee sufficient time prior to \n     the test to obtain and consult with legal counsel or an \n     employee representative.\n       (3) The statement to be provided to the employee must set \n     forth with particularity the specific incident or activity \n     being investigated and the basis for testing particular \n     employees. Section 7(d)(4)(A) of the EPPA requires \n     specificity beyond the mere assertion of general statements \n     regarding economic loss, employee access, and reasonable \n     suspicion. For example, an employer's assertion that an \n     expensive watch was stolen, and that the employee had access \n     to the watch and is therefore a suspect, would not meet the \n     ``with particularity'' criterion. If the basis for an \n     employer's requesting an employee (or employees) to take a \n     polygraph test is not articulated with particularity, and \n     reduced to writing, then the standard is not met. The \n     identity of a co-worker or other individual providing \n     information used to establish reasonable suspicion need not \n     be revealed in the statement.\n       (4) It is further required that the statement provided to \n     the examinee be signed by the employer, or an employee or \n     other representative of the employer with authority to \n     legally bind the employer. The person \n\n[[Page S 17661]]\n     signing the statement must not be a polygraph examiner unless the \n     examiner is acting solely in the capacity of an employer with \n     respect to his or her own employees and does not conduct the \n     examination. The standard would not be met, and the exemption \n     would not apply if the person signing the statement is not \n     authorized to legally bind the employer.\n       (h) Polygraph tests administered pursuant to this exemption \n     are subject to the limitations set forth in sections 8 and 10 \n     of the EPPA, as discussed in Secs. 1.20, 1.22, 1.23, 1.24, \n     1.25, 1.26, and 1.35 of this part. As provided in these \n     sections, the exemption will apply only if certain \n     requirements are met. Failure to satisfy any of the specified \n     requirements nullifies the statutory authority for polygraph \n     test administration and may subject the employing office to \n     remedial actions, as provided for in section 6(c) of the \n     EPPA.\n     Sec. 1.13 Exemption of employers authorized to manufacture, \n         distribute, or dispense controlled substances\n       (a) Section 7(f) of the EPPA, incorporated into the CAA by \n     section 225(f) of the CAA, provides an exemption from the \n     EPPA's general prohibition regarding the use of polygraph \n     tests for employers authorized to manufacture, distribute, or \n     dispense a controlled substance listed in schedule I, II, \n     III, or IV of section 202 of the Controlled Substances Act \n     (21 U.S.C. Sec. 812). This exemption permits the \n     administration of polygraph tests, subject to the conditions \n     set forth in sections 8 and 10 of the EPPA and Sec. 1.21, \n     1.22, 1.23, 1.24, 1.25, 1.26, and 1.35 of this part, to:\n       (1) A prospective employee who would have direct access to \n     the manufacture, storage, distribution, or sale of any such \n     controlled substance; or\n       (2) A current employee if the following conditions are met:\n       (i) The test is administered in connection with an ongoing \n     investigation of criminal or other misconduct involving, or \n     potentially involving, loss or injury to the manufacture, \n     distribution, or dispensing of any such controlled substance \n     by such employer; and\n       (ii) The employee had access to the person or property that \n     is the subject of the investigation.\n       (b)(1) The terms manufacture, distribute, distribution, \n     dispense, storage, and sale, for the purposes of this \n     exemption, are construed within the meaning of the Controlled \n     Substances Act (21 U.S.C. Sec. 812 et seq.), as administered \n     by the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), U.S. Department \n     of Justice.\n       (2) The exemption in section 7(f) of the EPPA applies only \n     to employers who are authorized by DEA to manufacture, \n     distribute, or dispense a controlled substance. Section 202 \n     of the Controlled Substances Act (21 U.S.C. Sec. 812) \n     requires every person who manufactures, distributes, or \n     dispenses any controlled substance to register with the \n     Attorney General (i.e., with DEA). Common or contract \n     carriers and warehouses whose possession of the controlled \n     substance is in the usual course of their business or \n     employment are not required to register. Truck drivers and \n     warehouse employees of the persons or entities registered \n     with DEA and authorized to manufacture, distribute, or \n     dispense controlled substances, are within the scope of the \n     exemption where they have direct access or access to the \n     controlled substances, as discussed below.\n       (c) In order for a polygraph examination to be performed, \n     section 7(f) of the Act requires that a prospective employee \n     have ``direct access'' to the controlled substance(s) \n     manufactured, dispensed, or distributed by the employer. \n     Where a current employee is to be tested as a part of an \n     ongoing investigation, section 7(f) requires that the \n     employee have ``access'' to the person or property that is \n     the subject of the investigation.\n       (1) A prospective employee would have ``direct access'' if \n     the position being applied for has responsibilities which \n     include contact with or which affect the disposition of a \n     controlled substance, including participation in the process \n     of obtaining, dispensing, or otherwise distributing a \n     controlled substance. This includes contact or direct \n     involvement in the manufacture, storage, testing, \n     distribution, sale or dispensing of a controlled substance \n     and may include, for example, packaging, repackaging, \n     ordering, licensing, shipping, receiving, taking inventory, \n     providing security, prescribing, and handling of a controlled \n     substance. A prospective employee would have ``direct \n     access'' if the described job duties would give such person \n     access to the products in question, whether such employee \n     would be in physical proximity to controlled substances or \n     engaged in activity which would permit the employee to divert \n     such substances to his or her possession.\n       (2) A current employee would have ``access'' within the \n     meaning of section 7(f) if the employee had access to the \n     specific person or property which is the subject of the on-\n     going investigation, as discussed in Sec. 1.12(e) of this \n     part. Thus, to test a current employee, the employee need not \n     have had ``direct'' access to the controlled substance, but \n     may have had only infrequent, random, or opportunistic \n     access. Such access would be sufficient to test the employee \n     if the employee could have caused, or could have aided or \n     abetted in causing, the loss of the specific property which \n     is the subject of the investigation. For example, a \n     maintenance worker in a drug warehouse, whose job duties \n     include the cleaning of areas where the controlled substances \n     which are the subject of the investigation were present, but \n     whose job duties do not include the handling of controlled \n     substances, would be deemed to have ``access'', but \n     normally not ``direct access'', to the controlled \n     substances. On the other hand, a drug warehouse truck \n     loader, whose job duties include the handling of outgoing \n     shipment orders which contain controlled substances, would \n     have ``direct access'' to such controlled substances. A \n     pharmacy department in a supermarket is another common \n     situation which is useful in illustrating the distinction \n     between ``direct access'' and ``access.'' Store personnel \n     receiving pharmaceutical orders, i.e., the pharmacist, \n     pharmacy intern, and other such employees working in the \n     pharmacy department, would ordinarily have ``direct \n     access'' to controlled substances. Other store personnel \n     whose job duties and responsibilities do not include the \n     handling of controlled substances but who had occasion to \n     enter the pharmacy department where the controlled \n     substances which are the subject of the investigation were \n     stored, such as maintenance personnel or pharmacy \n     cashiers, would have ``access.'' Certain other store \n     personnel whose job duties do not permit or require \n     entrance into the pharmacy department for any reason, such \n     as produce or meat clerks, checkout cashiers, or baggers, \n     would not ordinarily have ``access.'' However, any current \n     employee, regardless of described job duties, may be \n     polygraphed if the employer's investigation of criminal or \n     other misconduct discloses that such employee in fact took \n     action to obtain ``access'' to the person or property that \n     is the subject of the investigation--e.g., by actually \n     entering the drug storage area in violation of company \n     rules. In the case of ``direct access'', the prospective \n     employee's access to controlled substances would be as a \n     part of the manufacturing, dispensing or distribution \n     process, while a current employee's ``access'' to the \n     controlled substances which are the subject of the \n     investigation need only be opportunistic.\n       (d) The term prospective employee, for the purposes of this \n     section, includes a current employee who presently holds a \n     position which does not entail direct access to controlled \n     substances, and therefore is outside the scope of the \n     exemption's provisions for preemployment polygraph testing, \n     provided the employee has applied for and is being considered \n     for transfer or promotion to another position which entails \n     such direct access. For example, an office secretary may \n     apply for promotion to a position in the vault or cage areas \n     of a drug warehouse, where controlled substances are kept. In \n     such a situation, the current employee would be deemed a \n     ``prospective employee'' for the purposes of this exemption, \n     and thus could be subject to preemployment polygraph \n     screening, prior to such a change in position. However, any \n     adverse action which is based in part on a polygraph test \n     against a current employee who is considered a ``prospective \n     employee'' for purposes of this section may be taken only \n     with respect to the prospective position and may not affect \n     the employee's employment in the current position.\n       (e) Section 7(f) of the EPPA makes no specific reference to \n     a requirement that employers provide current employees with a \n     written statement prior to polygraph testing. Thus, employers \n     to whom this exemption is available are not required to \n     furnish a written statement such as that specified in section \n     7(d) of the EPPA and Sec. 1.12(a)(4) of this part.\n       (f) For the section 7(f) exemption to apply, the polygraph \n     testing of current employees must be administered in \n     connection with an ongoing investigation of criminal or other \n     misconduct involving, or potentially involving, loss or \n     injury to the manufacture, distribution, or dispensing of any \n     such controlled substance by such employer.\n       (1) Current employees may only be administered polygraph \n     tests in connection with an ongoing investigation of criminal \n     or other misconduct, relating to a specific incident or \n     activity, or potential incident or activity. Thus, an \n     employer is precluded from using the exemption in connection \n     with continuing investigations or on a random basis to \n     determine if thefts are occurring. However, unlike the \n     exemption in section 7(d) of the EPPA for employers \n     conducting ongoing investigations of economic loss or injury, \n     the section 7(f) exemption includes ongoing investigations of \n     misconduct involving potential drug losses. Nor does the \n     latter exemption include the requirement for ``reasonable \n     suspicion'' contained in the section 7(d) exemption. Thus, a \n     drug store employer is permitted to polygraph all current \n     employees who have access to a controlled substance stolen \n     from the inventory, or where there is evidence that such a \n     theft is planned. Polygraph testing based on an inventory \n     shortage of the drug during a particular accounting period \n     would not be permitted unless there is extrinsic evidence of \n     misconduct.\n       (2) In addition, the test must be administered in \n     connection with loss or injury, or potential loss or injury, \n     to the manufacture, distribution, or dispensing of a \n     controlled substance.\n       (i) Retail drugstores and wholesale drug warehouses \n     typically carry inventory of so-called health and beauty \n     aids, cosmetics, over-the-counter drugs, and a variety of \n     other similar products, in addition to their product lines of \n     controlled drugs. The noncontrolled products usually \n     constitute the majority of such firms' sales volumes. An \n     economic loss or injury related to such \n\n[[Page S 17662]]\n     noncontrolled substances would not constitute a basis of applicability \n     of the section 7(f) exemption. For example, an investigation \n     into the theft of a gross of cosmetic products could not be a \n     basis for polygraph testing under section 7(f), but the theft \n     of a container of valium could be.\n       (ii) Polygraph testing, with respect to an ongoing \n     investigation concerning products other than controlled \n     substances might be initiated under section 7(d) of the EPPA \n     and Sec. 1.12 of this part. However, the exemption in section \n     7(f) of the EPPA and this section is limited solely to losses \n     or injury associated with controlled substances.\n       (g) Polygraph tests administered pursuant to this exemption \n     are subject to the limitations set forth in sections 8 and 10 \n     of the EPPA, as discussed in Secs. 1.21, 1.22, 1.23, 1.24, \n     1.25, 1.26, and 1.35 of this part. As provided in these \n     sections, the exemption will apply only if certain \n     requirements are met. Failure to satisfy any of the specified \n     requirements nullifies the statutory authority for polygraph \n     test administration and may subject the employer to the \n     remedial actions authorized in section 204 of the CAA. The \n     administration of such tests is also subject to collective \n     bargaining agreements, which may either prohibit lie detector \n     tests, or contain more restrictive provisions with respect to \n     polygraph testing.\n\n\n      Subpart C--Restrictions on Polygraph Usage Under Exemptions\n\n     Sec. 1.20 Adverse employment action under ongoing \n         investigation exemption\n       (a) Section 8(a) (1) of the EPPA provides that the limited \n     exemption in section 7(d) of the EPPA and Sec. 1.12 of this \n     part for ongoing investigations shall not apply if an \n     employer discharges, disciplines, denies employment or \n     promotion or otherwise discriminates in any manner against a \n     current employee based upon the analysis of a polygraph test \n     chart or the refusal to take a polygraph test, without \n     additional supporting evidence.\n       (b) ``Additional supporting evidence'', for purposes of \n     section 8(a) of the EPPA, includes, but is not limited to, \n     the following:\n       (1)(i) Evidence indicating that the employee had access to \n     the missing or damaged property that is the subject of an \n     ongoing investigation; and\n       (ii) Evidence leading to the employer's reasonable \n     suspicion that the employee was involved in the incident or \n     activity under investigation; or\n       (2) Admissions or statements made by an employee before, \n     during or following a polygraph examination.\n       (c) Analysis of a polygraph test chart or refusal to take a \n     polygraph test may not serve as a basis for adverse \n     employment action, even with additional supporting evidence, \n     unless the employer observes all the requirements of sections \n     7(d) and 8(b) of the EPPA, as described in Secs. 1.12, 1.22, \n     1.23, 1.24 and 1.25 of this part.\n     Sec. 1.21 Adverse employment action under controlled \n         substance exemption\n       (a) Section 8(a)(2) of the EPPA provides that the \n     controlled substance exemption in section 7(f) of the EPPA \n     and section 1.13 of this part shall not apply if an employing \n     office discharges, disciplines, denies employment or \n     promotion, or otherwise discriminates in any manner against a \n     current employee or prospective employee based solely on the \n     analysis of a polygraph test chart or the refusal to take a \n     polygraph test.\n       (b) Analysis of a polygraph test chart or refusal to take a \n     polygraph test may serve as one basis for adverse employment \n     actions of the type described in paragraph (a) of this \n     section, provided that the adverse action was also based on \n     another bona fide reason, with supporting evidence therefor. \n     For example, traditional factors such as prior employment \n     experience, education, job performance, etc. may be used as a \n     basis for employment decisions. Employment decisions based on \n     admissions or statements made by an employee or prospective \n     employee before, during or following a polygraph examination \n     may, likewise, serve as a basis for such decisions.\n       (c) Analysis of a polygraph test chart or the refusal to \n     take a polygraph test may not serve as a basis for adverse \n     employment action, even with another legitimate basis for \n     such action, unless the employing office observes all the \n     requirements of section 7(f) of the EPPA, as appropriate, and \n     section 8(b) of the EPPA, as described in sections 1.13, \n     1.22, 1.23, 1.24 and 1.25 of this part.\n     Sec. 1.22 Rights of examinee--general\n       (a) Pursuant to section 8(b) of the EPPA, the limited \n     exemption in section 7(d) of the EPPA for ongoing \n     investigations (described in Sec. 1.12 of this part) shall \n     not apply unless all of the requirements set forth in this \n     section and Secs. 1.23 through 1.25 of this part are met.\n       (b) During all phases of the polygraph testing the person \n     being examined has the following rights:\n       (1) The examinee may terminate the test at any time.\n       (2) The examinee may not be asked any questions in a \n     degrading or unnecessarily intrusive manner.\n       (3) The examinee may not be asked any questions dealing \n     with:\n       (i) Religious beliefs or affiliations;\n       (ii) Beliefs or opinions regarding racial matters;\n       (iii) Political beliefs or affiliations;\n       (iv) Sexual preferences or behavior; or\n       (v) Beliefs, affiliations, opinions, or lawful activities \n     concerning unions or labor organizations.\n       (4) The examinee may not be subjected to a test when there \n     is sufficient written evidence by a physician that the \n     examinee is suffering from any medical or psychological \n     condition or undergoing any treatment that might cause \n     abnormal responses during the actual testing phase. \n     ``Sufficient written evidence'' shall constitute, at a \n     minimum, a statement by a physician specifically describing \n     the examinee's medical or psychological condition or \n     treatment and the basis for the physician's opinion that the \n     condition or treatment might result in such abnormal \n     responses.\n       (5) An employee or prospective employee who exercises the \n     right to terminate the test, or who for medical reasons with \n     sufficient supporting evidence is not administered the test, \n     shall be subject to adverse employment action only on the \n     same basis as one who refuses to take a polygraph test, as \n     described in Secs. 1.20 and 1.21 of this part.\n       (c) Any polygraph examination shall consist of one or more \n     pretest phases, actual testing phases, and post-test phases, \n     which must be conducted in accordance with the rights of \n     examinees described in Secs. 1.23 through 1.25 of this part.\n     Sec. 1.23 Rights of examinee--pretest phase\n       (a) The pretest phase consists of the questioning and other \n     preparation of the prospective examinee before the actual use \n     of the polygraph instrument. During the initial pretest \n     phase, the examinee must be:\n       (1) Provided with written notice, in a language understood \n     by the examinee, as to when and where the examination will \n     take place and that the examinee has the right to consult \n     with counsel or an employee representative before each phase \n     of the test. Such notice shall be received by the examinee at \n     least forty-eight hours, excluding weekend days and holidays, \n     before the time of the examination, except that a prospective \n     employee may, at the employee's option, give written consent \n     to administration of a test anytime within 48 hours but no \n     earlier than 24 hours after receipt of the written notice. \n     The written notice or proof of service must set forth the \n     time and date of receipt by the employee or prospective \n     employee and be verified by his or her signature. The purpose \n     of this requirement is to provide a sufficient opportunity \n     prior to the examination for the examinee to consult with \n     counsel or an employee representative. Provision shall also \n     be made for a convenient place on the premises where the \n     examination will take place at which the examinee may consult \n     privately with an attorney or an employee representative \n     before each phase of the test. The attorney or representative \n     may be excluded from the room where the examination is \n     administered during the actual testing phase.\n       (2) Informed orally and in writing of the nature and \n     characteristics of the polygraph instrument and examination, \n     including an explanation of the physical operation of the \n     polygraph instrument and the procedure used during the \n     examination.\n       (3) Provided with a written notice prior to the testing \n     phase, in a language understood by the examinee, which shall \n     be read to and signed by the examinee. Use of Appendix A to \n     this part, if properly completed, will constitute compliance \n     with the contents of the notice requirement of this \n     paragraph. If a format other than in Appendix A is used, it \n     must contain at least the following information:\n       (i) Whether or not the polygraph examination area contains \n     a two-way mirror, a camera, or other device through which the \n     examinee may be observed;\n       (ii) Whether or not any other device, such as those used in \n     conversation or recording will be used during the \n     examination;\n       (iii) That both the examinee and the employing office have \n     the right, with the other's knowledge, to make a recording of \n     the entire examination;\n       (iv) That the examinee has the right to terminate the test \n     at any time;\n       (v) That the examinee has the right, and will be given the \n     opportunity, to review all questions to be asked during the \n     test;\n       (vi) That the examinee may not be asked questions in a \n     manner which degrades, or needlessly intrudes;\n       (vii) That the examinee may not be asked any questions \n     concerning religious beliefs or opinions; beliefs regarding \n     racial matters; political beliefs or affiliations; matters \n     relating to sexual behavior; beliefs, affiliations, opinions, \n     or lawful activities regarding unions or labor organizations;\n       (viii) That the test may not be conducted if there is \n     sufficient written evidence by a physician that the examinee \n     is suffering from a medical or psychological condition or \n     undergoing treatment that might cause abnormal responses \n     during the examination;\n       (ix) That the test is not and cannot be required as a \n     condition of employment;\n       (x) That the employing office may not discharge, dismiss, \n     discipline, deny employment or promotion, or otherwise \n     discriminate against the examinee based on the analysis of a \n     polygraph test, or based on the examinee's refusal to take \n     such a test, without additional evidence which would support \n     such action;\n       (xi)(A) In connection with an ongoing investigation, that \n     the additional evidence required for the employing office to \n     take adverse action against the examinee, including \n     termination, may be evidence that the examinee had access to \n     the property that is the subject of the investigation, \n     together with \n\n[[Page S 17663]]\n     evidence supporting the employer's reasonable suspicion that the \n     examinee was involved in the incident or activity under \n     investigation;\n       (B) That any statement made by the examinee before or \n     during the test may serve as additional supporting evidence \n     for an adverse employment action, as described in paragraph \n     (a)(3)(x) of this section, and that any admission of criminal \n     conduct by the examinee may be transmitted to an appropriate \n     government law enforcement agency;\n       (xii) That information acquired from a polygraph test may \n     be disclosed by the examiner or by the employing office only:\n       (A) To the examinee or any other person specifically \n     designated in writing by the examinee to receive such \n     information;\n       (B) To the employing office that requested the test;\n       (C) To a court, governmental agency, arbitrator, or \n     mediator pursuant to a court order;\n       (D) By the employing office, to an appropriate governmental \n     agency without a court order where, and only insofar as, the \n     information disclosed is an admission of criminal conduct;\n       (xiii) That if any of the examinee's rights or protections \n     under the law are violated, the examinee has the right to \n     take action against the employing office under sections 401-\n     404 of the CAA. Employing offices that violate this law are \n     liable to the affected examinee, who may recover such legal \n     or equitable relief as may be appropriate, including, but not \n     limited to, employment, reinstatement, and promotion, payment \n     of lost wages and benefits, and reasonable costs, including \n     attorney's fees;\n       (xiv) That the examinee has the right to obtain and consult \n     with legal counsel or other representative before each phase \n     of the test, although the legal counsel or representative may \n     be excluded from the room where the test is administered \n     during the actual testing phase.\n       (xv) That the employee's rights under the EPPA may not be \n     waived, either voluntarily or involuntarily, by contract or \n     otherwise, except as part of a written settlement to a \n     pending action or complaint under the EPPA, agreed to and \n     signed by the parties.\n       (b) During the initial or any subsequent pretest phases, \n     the examinee must be given the opportunity, prior to the \n     actual testing phase, to review all questions in writing that \n     the examiner will ask during each testing phase. Such \n     questions may be presented at any point in time prior to the \n     testing phase.\n     Sec. 1.24 Rights of examinee--actual testing phase\n       (a) The actual testing phase refers to that time during \n     which the examiner administers the examination by using a \n     polygraph instrument with respect to the examinee and then \n     analyzes the charts derived from the test. Throughout the \n     actual testing phase, the examiner shall not ask any question \n     that was not presented in writing for review prior to the \n     testing phase. An examiner may, however, recess the testing \n     phase and return to the pre-test phase to review additional \n     relevant questions with the examinee. In the case of an \n     ongoing investigation, the examiner shall ensure that all \n     relevant questions (as distinguished from technical baseline \n     questions) pertain to the investigation.\n       (b) No testing period subject to the provisions of the Act \n     shall be less than ninety minutes in length. Such ``test \n     period'' begins at the time that the examiner begins \n     informing the examinee of the nature and characteristics of \n     the examination and the instruments involved, as prescribed \n     in section 8(b)(2)(B) of the EPPA and Sec. 1.23(a)(2) of this \n     part, and ends when the examiner completes the review of the \n     test results with the examinee as provided in Sec. 1.25 of \n     this part. The ninety-minute minimum duration shall not apply \n     if the examinee voluntarily acts to terminate the test before \n     the completion thereof, in which event the examiner may not \n     render an opinion regarding the employee's truthfulness.\n     Sec. 1.25 Rights of examinee--post-test phase\n       (a) The post-test phase refers to any questioning or other \n     communication with the examinee following the use of the \n     polygraph instrument, including review of the results of the \n     test with the examinee. Before any adverse employment action, \n     the employing office must:\n       (1) Further interview the examinee on the basis of the test \n     results; and\n       (2) Give to the examinee a written copy of any opinions or \n     conclusions rendered in response to the test, as well as the \n     questions asked during the test, with the corresponding \n     charted responses. The term ``corresponding charted \n     responses'' refers to copies of the entire examination charts \n     recording the employee's physiological responses, and not \n     just the examiner's written report which describes the \n     examinee's responses to the questions as ``charted'' by the \n     instrument.\n     Sec. 1.26 Qualifications of and requirements for examiners\n       (a) Section 8 (b) and (c ) of the EPPA provides that the \n     limited exemption in section 7(d) of the EPPA for ongoing \n     investigations shall not apply unless the person conducting \n     the polygraph examination meets specified qualifications and \n     requirements.\n       (b) An examiner must meet the following qualifications:\n       (1) Have a valid current license, if required by the State \n     in which the test is to be conducted; and\n       (2) Carry a minimum bond of $50,000 provided by a surety \n     incorporated under the laws of the United States or of any \n     State, which may under those laws guarantee the fidelity of \n     persons holding positions of trust, or carry an equivalent \n     amount of professional liability coverage.\n       (c) An examiner must also, with respect to examinees \n     identified by the employing office pursuant to Sec. 1.30(c) \n     of this part:\n       (1) Observe all rights of examinees, as set out in Secs. \n     1.22, 1.23, 1.24, and 1.25 of this part;\n       (2) Administer no more than five polygraph examinations in \n     any one calendar day on which a test or tests subject to the \n     provisions of EPPA are administered, not counting those \n     instances where an examinee voluntarily terminates an \n     examination prior to the actual testing phase;\n       (3) Administer no polygraph examination subject to the \n     provisions of the EPPA which is less than ninety minutes in \n     duration, as described in Sec. 1.24(b) of this part; and\n       (4) Render any opinion or conclusion regarding truthfulness \n     or deception in writing.

Such action would not constitute disclosure under \n     this part provided that the other examiner has no direct or \n     indirect interest in the matter.\n\n\n               APPENDIX A TO PART 801--NOTICE TO EXAMINEE\n\n       Section 204 of the Congressional Accountability Act, which \n     extends the rights and protections of section 8(b) of the \n     Employee Polygraph Protection Act, and the regulations of the \n     Board of Directors of the Office of Compliance (Sections \n     1.22, 1.23, 1.24, and 1.25), require that you be given the \n     following information before taking a polygraph examination:\n       1. (a) The polygraph examination area [does] [does not] \n     contain a two-way mirror, a camera, or other device through \n     which you may be observed.\n       (b) Another device, such as those used in conversation or \n     recording, [will] [will not] be used during the examination. \n\n[[Page S 17664]]\n\n       (c) Both you and the employing office have the right, with \n     the other's knowledge, to record electronically the entire \n     examination.\n       2. (a) You have the right to terminate the test at any \n     time.\n       (b) You have the right, and will be given the opportunity, \n     to review all questions to be asked during the test.\n       (c) You may not be asked questions in a manner which \n     degrades, or needlessly intrudes.\n       (d) You may not be asked any questions concerning: \n     Religious beliefs or opinions; beliefs regarding racial \n     matters; political beliefs or affiliations; matters relating \n     to sexual preference or behavior; beliefs, affiliations, \n     opinions, or lawful activities regarding unions or labor \n     organizations.\n       (e) The test may not be conducted if there is sufficient \n     written evidence by a physician that you are suffering from a \n     medical or psychological condition or undergoing treatment \n     that might cause abnormal responses during the examination.\n       (f) You have the right to consult with legal counsel or \n     other representative before each phase of the test, although \n     the legal counsel or other representative may be excluded \n     from the room where the test is administered during the \n     actual testing phase.\n       3. (a) The test is not and cannot be required as a \n     condition of employment.\n       (b) The employer may not discharge, dismiss, discipline, \n     deny employment or promotion, or otherwise discriminate \n     against you based on the analysis of a polygraph test, or \n     based on your refusal to take such a test without additional \n     evidence which would support such action.\n       (c)(1) In connection with an ongoing investigation, the \n     additional evidence required for an employing office to take \n     adverse action against you, including termination, may be (A) \n     evidence that you had access to the property that is the \n     subject of the investigation, together with (B) the evidence \n     supporting the employing office's reasonable suspicion that \n     you were involved in the incident or activity under \n     investigation.\n       (2) Any statement made by you before or during the test may \n     serve as additional supporting evidence for an adverse \n     employment action, as described in 3(b) above, and any \n     admission of criminal conduct by you may be transmitted to an \n     appropriate government law enforcement agency.\n       4. (a) Information acquired from a polygraph test may be \n     disclosed by the examiner or by the employing office only:\n       (1) To you or any other person specifically designated in \n     writing by you to receive such information;\n       (2) To the employing office that requested the test;\n       (3) To a court, governmental agency, arbitrator, or \n     mediator that obtains a court order;\n       (b) Information acquired from a polygraph test may be \n     disclosed by the employing office to an appropriate \n     governmental agency without a court order where, and only \n     insofar as, the information disclosed is an admission of \n     criminal conduct.\n       5. If any of your rights or protections under the law are \n     violated, you have the right to take action against the \n     employing office by filing a request for counseling with the \n     Office of Compliance under section 402 of the Congressional \n     Accountability Act. Employing offices that violate this law \n     are liable to the affected examinee, who may recover such \n     legal or equitable relief as may be appropriate, including, \n     but not limited to, employment, reinstatement, and promotion, \n     payment of lost wages and benefits, and reasonable costs, \n     including attorney's fees.\n       6. Your rights under the EPPA may not be waived, either \n     voluntarily or involuntarily, by contract or otherwise, \n     except as part of a written settlement to a pending action or \n     complaint under the EPPA, and agreed to and signed by the \n     parties.\n       I acknowledge that I have received a copy of the above \n     notice, and that it has been read to me. ____________________\n     (Date) ____________________\n     (Signature)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/11/28/senate-section/article/S17603-1", "month": "11", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "28", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S17664]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n        MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT RECEIVED DURING ADJOURNMENT\n\n  Under the authority of the order of the Senate of January 4, 1995, \nthe Secretary of the Senate on November 27, 1995, received a message \nfrom the President of the United States submitting sundry nominations, \nwhich were referred to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  The nominations received on November 27, 1995, are shown in today's \nRecord at the end of the Senate proceedings.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/11/28/senate-section/article/S17664-1", "month": "11", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "28", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S17664]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Thomas, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/11/28/senate-section/article/S17664-2", "month": "11", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "28", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S17664]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session, the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were offered to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/11/28/senate-section/article/S17664-3", "month": "11", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "28", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S17664]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n REPORT OF THE RAILROAD RETIREMENT BOARD FOR FISCAL YEAR 1994--MESSAGE \n                       FROM THE PRESIDENT--PM 97\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER laid before the Senate the following message \nfrom the President of the United States, together with an accompanying \nreport; which was referred to the Committee on Labor and Human \nResources:\n\nTo the Congress of the United States:\n  I transmit herewith the Annual Report of the Railroad Retirement \nBoard for Fiscal Year 1994, pursuant to the provisions of section \n7(b)(6) of the Railroad Retirement Act and section 12(1) of the \nRailroad Unemployment Insurance Act.\n                                                  William J.

This report is submitted pursuant to section 204(c) \nof the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, 50 U.S.C. 1703(c) \nand section 505(c) of the International Security and Development \nCooperation Act of 1985, 22 U.S.C. 2349aa-9(c). This report covers \nevents through September 29, 1995. My last report, dated May 18, 1995, \ncovered events through April 18, 1995.\n  1. On March 15 of this year by Executive Order No. 12957, I declared \na separate national emergency pursuant to the International Emergency \nEconomic Powers Act and imposed separate sanctions. Executive Order No. \n12959, issued May 6, 1995, then significantly augmented those new \nsanctions. As a result, as I reported on September 18, 1995, in \nconjunction with the declaration of a separate emergency and the \nimposition of new sanctions, the Iranian Transactions Regulations, 31 \nCFR Part 560, have been comprehensively amended.\n  There have been no amendments to the Iranian Assets Control \nRegulations, 31 CFR Part 535, since the last report. However, the \namendments to the Iranian Transactions Regulations that implement the \nnew separate national emergency are of some relevance to the Iran-\nUnited States Claims Tribunal (the ``Tribunal'') and related \nactivities. For example, sections 560.510, 560.513, and 560.525 contain \ngeneral licenses with respect to, and provide for specific licensing \nof, certain transactions related to arbitral activities.\n  2. The Tribunal, established at The Hague pursuant to the Algiers \nAccords, continues to make progress in arbitrating the claims before \nit. Since my last report, the Tribunal has rendered four awards, \nbringing the total number to 566. As of September 29, 1995, the value \nof awards to successful American claimants from the Security Account \nheld by the NV Settlement Bank stood at $2,368,274,541.67.\n  Iran has not replenished the Security Account established by the \nAccords to ensure payment of awards to successful U.S. claimants since \nOctober 8, 1992. The Account has remained continuously below the $500 \nmillion balance required by the Algiers Accords since November 5, 1992. \nAs of September 29, 1995, the total amount in the Security Account was \n$188,105,627.95, and the total amount in the Interest Account was \n$32,066,870.62.\n  Therefore, the United States continues to pursue Case A/28, filed in \nSeptember 1993, to require Iran to meet its obligations under the \nAccords to replenish the Security Account. Iran filed its Statement of \nDefense in that case on August 31, 1995. The United States is preparing \na Reply for filing on December 4, 1995.\n\n[[Page S 17665]]\n\n  3. The Department of State continues to present other United States \nGovernment claims against Iran, in coordination with concerned \ngovernment agencies, and to respond to claims brought against the \nUnited States by Iran, in coordination with concerned government \nagencies.\n  In September 1995, the Departments of Justice and State represented \nthe United States in the first Tribunal hearing on a government-to-\ngovernment claim in 5 years. The Full Tribunal heard arguments in Cases \nA/15(IV) and A/24. Case A/15(IV) is an interpretive dispute in which \nIran claims that the United States has violated the Algiers Accords by \nits alleged failure to terminate all litigation against Iran in U.S. \ncourts. Case A/24 involves a similar interpretive dispute in which, \nspecifically, Iran claims that the obligation of the United States \nunder the Accords to terminate litigation prohibits a lawsuit against \nIran by the McKesson Corporation from proceeding in U.S. District Court \nfor the District of Columbia. The McKesson Corporation reactivated that \nlitigation against Iran in the United States following the Tribunal's \nnegative ruling on Foremost McKesson Incorporated's claim before the \nTribunal.\n  Also in September 1995, Iran filed briefs in two cases, to which the \nUnited States is now preparing responses. In Case A/11, Iran filed its \nHearing Memorial and Evidence. In that case, Iran has sued the United \nStates for $10 billion, alleging that the United States failed to \nfulfill its obligations under the Accords to assist Iran in recovering \nthe assets of the former Shah of Iran. Iran alleges that the United \nStates improperly failed to (1) freeze the U.S. assets of the Shah's \nestate and certain U.S. assets of close relatives of the Shah; (2) \nreport to Iran all known information about such assets; and (3) \notherwise assist Iran in such litigation.\n  In Case A/15(II:A), 3 years after the Tribunal's partial award in the \ncase, Iran filed briefs and evidence relating to 10 of Iran's claims \nagainst the United States Government for nonmilitary property allegedly \nheld by private companies in the United States. Although Iran's \nsubmission was made in response to a Tribunal order directing Iran to \nfile its brief and evidence ``concerning all remaining issues to be \ndecided by this Case,'' Iran's filing failed to address many claims in \nthe case.\n  In August 1995, the United States filed the second of two parts of \nits consolidated submission on the merits in Case B/61, addressing \nissues of liability and compensation. As reported in my May 1995 \nReport, Case B/61 involves a claim by Iran for compensation with \nrespect to primarily military equipment that Iran alleges it did not \nreceive. The equipment was purchased pursuant to commercial contracts \nwith more than 50 private American companies. Iran alleges that it \nsuffered direct losses and consequential damages in excess of $2 \nbillion in total because the United States Government's refusal to \nallow the export of the equipment after January 19, 1981, in alleged \ncontravention of the Algiers Accords.\n  4. Since my last report, the Tribunal has issued two important awards \nin favor of U.S. nationals considered dual United States-Iranian \nnationals by the Tribunal. On July 7, 1995, the Tribunal issued Award \nNo. 565, awarding a claimant $1.1 million plus interest for Iran's \nexpropriation of the claimant's shares in the Iranian architectural \nfirm of Abdolaziz Farmafarmaian & Associates. On July 14, 1995, the \nTribunal issued Award No. 566, awarding two claimants $129,869 each, \nplus interest, as compensation for Iran's taking real property \ninherited by the claimants from their father. Award No. 566 is \nsignificant in that it is the Tribunal's first decision awarding dual \nnational claimants compensation for Iran's expropriation of real \nproperty in Iran.\n  5. The situation reviewed above continues to implicate important \ndiplomatic, financial, and legal interests of the United States and its \nnationals and presents an unusual challenge to the national security \nand foreign policy of the United States. The Iranian Assets Control \nRegulations issued pursuant to Executive Order No. 12170 continue to \nplay an important role in structuring our relationship with Iran and in \nenabling the United States to implement properly the Algiers Accords. I \nshall continue to exercise the powers at my disposal to deal with these \nproblems and will continue to report periodically to the Congress on \nsignificant developments.\n                                                  William J.

A bill to improve the national crime database and create a \nFederal cause of action for early release of violent felons; to the \nCommittee on the Judiciary.\n\n\n               THE VIOLENT CRIME INTERVENTION ACT OF 1995\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation that \nwill fill the void in the Federal response to the Nation's crime \nepidemic by putting violent offenders in jail and keeping them there.\n  Probably all of us have seen reference in the papers these days that \ncrime is down. According to the statistics by the FBI, there is a \nslight decrease in crime in our country. That ought not give anyone \ngreat comfort, in my judgment, because the slight decrease comes from \nan extraordinarily high rate of crime in our country.\n  A violent crime occurs every 17 seconds in America; a rape occurs \nevery 5 minutes; a robbery, every 51 seconds; a murder every 23 \nminutes.\n  We have a country that is, presumably, a civilized nation full of \nwonderful people--with 23,000 murders every year. So no one should take \ngreat solace in the fact that the FBI or someone else says the crime \nrate is down slightly. It is at an extraordinarily high level, and \nrepresents an epidemic of crime that we must deal with.\n  Crime no longer is limited to specific neighborhoods, cities, or \nStates. It is a national epidemic, and the criminal justice system of \neach State often affects citizens of other states. My legislation, the \nViolent Crime Intervention Act of 1995, addresses two aspects of this \nproblem that on which the Federal Government must show leadership.\n  First, the bill will make it a national priority to put into \noperation a complete, accurate, and up-to-date nationwide database of \ncriminal records. Currently, the Federal Bureau of Investigation's \ninterstate identification index--the triple-I--provides more than \n75,000 criminal record checks every day, but the information it \nprovides is incomplete and, therefore, unreliable. In fact, only 30 \nStates currently participate in this system.\n  The bill will help to complete a national database of violent \ncriminals. Last year's crime bill appropriated $100 million for fiscal \nyear 1995 to help states establish or improve their criminal databases \nunder the Brady law. It also authorized another $50 million for this \nsame purpose for fiscal years 1996 and 1997. Under my legislation, \nevery State must set up a criminal record database within 2 years that \nis connected to the Triple-I and that provides accurate information \nabout that State's criminals.\n  States that do not comply with these provisions would not be shut off \nfrom using the Triple-I system. That could hurt law enforcement. \nHowever, they would have to pay a fee each time they use the system \nuntil they contribute their own complete and up-to-date records.\n  It does not take Dick Tracy to figure out who is going to commit the \nnext murder, or the next violent crime. You can almost bet that the \nnext violent crime in America committed in the next 45 seconds or so \nwill be committed by someone who has committed violent crimes in the \npast. You can almost guarantee it. That is why it is critical for us to \nknow who has committed previous crimes.\n  I will mention a personal story. My mother was a victim of a \nmanslaughter incident some years ago. She was tragically killed in a \ncircumstance in which those who were involved had criminal records. As \nI looked at those criminal records, I saw something curious. I saw that \na judge with respect to one of the people involved had sentenced him to \nthe State penitentiary once for a crime. He was picked up again when he \nwas out on probation, was sent back to court--and the judge said, \n``Well, OK. On the second offense you get probation.''\n  I called the judge. I said, ``Why would you give probation on a \nsecond offense?''\n  He said, ``Because I did not know the person committed the first \noffense.''\n  I said, ``You are kidding me. This defendant stands in front of you, \na defendant who has been in State penitentiary, and you did not know \nthat when you sentenced the defendant for the second offense?''\n  He said, ``I had no idea.''\n  Computer records even between jurisdictions in the same State were \nnot then available to give the judge that basic information.\n  It does not make any sense what is going on. Michael Jordan's father \nwas murdered allegedly by two people on a road in the Carolinas. Take a \nlook at their records. The two people who allegedly killed Michael \nJordan's father--both of them--had long criminal histories. And I will \nbet, if you access the triple-I, you will not find half of their \ncriminal histories.\n  Second, my bill will provide a strong incentive for States to keep \ntheir violent criminals locked up for the criminal's full sentence. \nLast year's crime bill offered Federal crime-fighting funds to States \nthat keep violent criminals locked up for at least 85 percent of their \nsentences. Surely we can do better than that.\n  Under my legislation, a State will be liable to victims of violent \ncrimes committed by criminals the State released early from a sentence \nfor a previous violent crime. A State could avoid liability only if the \nState required all violent criminals to serve their full sentences.\n  It occurred to me that we ought to do this because of a wonderful \nwoman named Donna Martz who was murdered. She used to come to the \nCapitol steps and bring bus tours from North Dakota. I used to see her \nmost every year and visit with her. She was murdered about 2 years ago \nby a couple of people who were convicted of violent crimes in \nPennsylvania, and then they went to North Dakota, and abducted Donna \nMartz. The story is too violent \n\n[[Page S 17667]]\nand awful even to retell. They took her through several States, and \neventually brutally murdered her out in the desert of the West.\n  My point is this. Someone who is convicted in the State for a violent \ncrime ought to serve their entire sentence. If a State decides for its \nown reasons that this violent criminal shall be let out before a \nsentence is ended, then I think that the State ought to be liable to \nthe next victim or to the next victim's family. If that violent \ncriminal is let out early and commits another violent act during the \ntime when they should have been in a prison, make the State liable for \nits decision. That is the second part of my legislation. Clearly, the \nStates will not like this.\n  States simply must keep known, violent offenders behind bars for \ntheir full sentence--or face the consequences of the State's decision \nto release these criminals. It is time for States to take \nresponsibility for the horrible suffering and fear they can foster by \nprematurely releasing violent criminals.\n  These issues are of national concern and we can deal with them if the \nFederal and State governments make a concerted effort to keep violent \noffenders behind bars for their full sentences.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of my bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1427\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Violent Crime Intervention \n     Act of 1995''.\n\n                TITLE I--NATIONAL CRIME RECORDS DATABASE\n\n     SEC. 101. FINDINGS.\n\n       The Congress finds that--\n       (1) nationwide--\n       (A) many State criminal record systems are not up to date \n     and contain incomplete or incorrect information; and\n       (B) less than 20 percent of all criminal records are fully \n     computerized, include court dispositions, and are accessible \n     through the Interstate Identification Index of the Department \n     of Justice; and\n       (2) a complete and accurate nationwide criminal record \n     database is an essential element in fighting crime and \n     development of such a database is a national priority.\n\n     SEC. 102. STATE CRIMINAL RECORD UPGRADES.\n\n       (a) In General.--Not later than 180 days after the date of \n     enactment of this Act, the Attorney General of the United \n     States shall issue guidelines establishing specific \n     requirements for a State to qualify as a fully participating \n     member of the Interstate Identification Index.\n       (b) Minimum Requirements.--The guidelines referred to in \n     subsection (a) shall require--\n       (1) that all arrest reports and final disposition orders \n     are submitted to the State records repository within 7 days;\n       (2) the State repository to enter these records and orders \n     into the State database not more than 24 hours after the \n     repository receives the information;\n       (3) the State to conduct audits, at least annually, of \n     State criminal records to ensure that such records contain \n     correct and complete information about every felony arrest \n     and report the results of each audit to the Attorney General \n     of the United States;\n       (4) the State to certify to the Attorney General of the \n     United States, on January 1 of each year, that the law \n     enforcement agencies, courts, and records officials of the \n     State are in compliance with this section; and\n       (5) such other conditions as the Attorney General \n     determines are necessary.\n       (c) Limitations on Use of Files.--The Attorney General may \n     establish limitations on the purposes for which the \n     Interstate Identification Index may be used and may allow a \n     State to prohibit the use of information provided by the \n     State for searches unrelated to law enforcement.\n       (d) Fees.--A State that does not qualify as a fully \n     participating State, pursuant to the guidelines referred to \n     in subsection (a), within 2 years after the date on which the \n     Attorney General of the United States issues such \n     guidelines shall pay a user fee for each identification \n     request made to the Interstate Identification Index in an \n     amount equal to the average cost of a single Federal \n     database inquiry, as determined by the Attorney General \n     each year.\n\n        TITLE II--LIABILITY FOR EARLY RELEASE OF VIOLENT FELONS\n\n     SEC. 201. FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Congress finds that--\n       (1) violent criminals often serve only a small portion of \n     their original sentences;\n       (2) a significant proportion of the most serious violent \n     crimes committed in the United States are committed by \n     criminals who have been released early from a sentence for a \n     previous violent crime;\n       (3) violent criminals who are released early from prison \n     often travel to other States to commit additional violent \n     crimes;\n       (4) the crime and threat of crime committed by violent \n     criminals released early from prison affects tourism, \n     economic development, use of the interstate highway system, \n     federally owned or supported facilities, and other commercial \n     activities of individuals; and\n       (5) the policies of one State regarding the early release \n     of criminals sentenced in that State for a violent crime \n     often affect the citizens of other States, who can influence \n     those policies only through Federal law.\n       (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this title is to reduce \n     violent crime by requiring States to bear the responsibility \n     for the consequences of releasing violent criminals before \n     they serve the full term for which they were sentenced.\n\n     SEC. 202. CAUSE OF ACTION.\n\n       (a) In General.--The victim (or in the case of a homicide, \n     the family of the victim) of a violent crime shall have a \n     Federal cause of action in any district court against a State \n     if the individual committing the crime--\n       (1) had previously been convicted by the State of a violent \n     offense;\n       (2) was released prior to serving his or her full sentence \n     for such offense; and\n       (3) committed the violent crime before the original \n     sentence would have expired.\n       (b) Definition.--As used in this title, the term ``crime of \n     violence'' has the same meaning as in section 16 of title 18, \n     United States Code.\n       (c) Damages.--A State shall be liable to the victim in an \n     action brought under this title for the actual damages \n     (direct and indirect) resulting from the violent crime, but \n     not for punitive damages.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. DOMENICI (for himself, Mr. Lott, Mr. Stevens, Mr. Cohen, \n        Mr. Exon, Mr. Pressler, and Mr. Warner):\n  S. 1429. A bill to provide clarification in the reimbursement to \nStates for federally funded employees carrying out Federal programs \nduring the lapse in appropriations between November 14, 1995, through \nNovember 19, 1995, to the Committee on Governmental Affairs.\n\n\nReimbursement for Furloughed Federal Employees During Recent Government \n                          Shutdown Legislation\n\n Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I introduce legislation relating \nto the recently enacted continuing appropriations resolution and \nconcerns that have been raised regarding the payment of furloughed \nemployees during the 6-day Government closure. I am joined in offering \nthis legislation by my distinguished colleagues, Senators Lott and \nSenator Warner.\n  Mr. President, the furlough pay language that the Congress adopted as \npart of House Joint Resolution 122, the continuing resolution, is \nlanguage that previous Congresses have adopted to provide compensation \nto Federal employees during periods of Government closure.\n  This language was enacted to provide compensation to Federal \nemployees affected by Government closure in 1984, 1986, 1987, and 1990. \nThis language was provided to Congress by the administration to meet \nour stated intent that Federal workers should not suffer a loss of pay \nas a result of the 6-day closure of the Federal Government.\n  It has now been brought to our attention that the language included \nin the continuing resolution may inadvertently not cover all employees \nwho were subject to the furlough. The administration has indicated that \nthere are State employees paid with 100 percent Federal funds who make \ndisability determinations and administer unemployment insurance \nbenefits, for example, that may not be covered by the language in the \ncontinuing resolution regarding the payment of compensation during the \nrecent 6-day shutdown of the Federal Government.\n  I am therefore introducing legislation to clarify our intent that all \nfurloughed Federal workers, including federally funded workers, \naffected by the shutdown of the Federal Government receive their pay as \nCongress intended. The legislation ensures that 100 percent federally-\nfunded State employees affected by the furlough receive their pay, and \nthat States using their own funds to make up for the lack of Federal \nfunds for these employees are reimbursed to carry out 100 percent \nfederally-supported functions.\n  Mr. President, it was and is clearly the intent of the Congress to \npay Federal workers for the 6-day period of the Government shutdown. \nThe language enacted in the continuing resolution has been used in \nprevious years to successfully address this situation. I hope the \nlanguage does so this year. If not, I urge my colleagues to adopt the \nbill I am introducing to clarify our intent on this matter.\n                                  _____\n\n                                 \n[[Page S 17668]]\n\n      By Mr. PRESSLER (for himself, and Mr. Daschle):\n  S. 1430. A bill to authorize a land conveyance at the radar bomb-\nscoring site, Belle Fourche, SD; to the Committee on Armed Services.\n\n\n                      LAND CONVEYANCE LEGISLATION\n\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation \nthat would transfer Air Force radar bomb-scoring facilities near Belle \nFourche, SD, to the local Belle Fourche School District. The Air Force \nhas declared facilities located at Detachment 21 of the 554th Range \nSquadron as excess Federal property. The Air Force is expected to \ndispose of the excess bomb-scoring facilities in July 1996.\n  Mr. President, the transfer of excess Air Force facilities to the \nBelle Fourche School District would relieve overcrowded local public \neducational facilities in a school district with increasing \nenrollments. Currently, the Belle Fourche School District is one of the \npoorest school districts in South Dakota. A small tax base coupled with \na proposed additional tax burden for the renovation of the old \nRoosevelt school building prompted local taxpayers to reject two bond \nissues that would have relieved the growing classroom crowding problem. \nThe transfer of excess Air Force facilities to the Belle Fourche School \nDistrict is a responsible, cost-effective approach to addressing an \nincreasingly serious local problem. It is an example of two levels of \ngovernment cooperating for a common good. The transfer of excess Air \nForce facilities would help provide a quality educational environment \nfor many schoolchildren living in Belle Fourche.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that resolutions of support \nfor my legislation from State, county, city and local governments be \nincluded in the Record. I further ask unanimous consent the full text \nof the bill be printed in the Record. I urge my colleagues to adopt \nthis important legislation.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1430\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. LAND CONVEYANCE, RADAR BOMB SCORING SITE, BELLE \n                   FOURCHE, SOUTH DAKOTA.\n\n       (a) Conveyance Authorized.--The Secretary of the Air Force \n     may convey, without consideration, to the Belle Fourche \n     School District, Belle Fourche, South Dakota (in this section \n     referred to as the ``District''), all right, title, and \n     interest of the United States in and to a parcel of real \n     property, together with any improvements thereon, consisting \n     of approximately 37 acres located in Belle Fourche, South \n     Dakota, which has served as the location of a support complex \n     and housing facilities for Detachment 21 of the 554th Range \n     Squadron, an Air Force Radar Bomb Scoring Site located in \n     Belle Fourche, South Dakota. The conveyance may not include \n     any portion of the radar bomb scoring site located in the \n     State of Wyoming.\n       (b) Condition of Conveyance.--The conveyance authorized \n     under subsection (a) shall be subject to the condition that \n     the District--\n       (1) use the property and facilities conveyed under that \n     subsection for education, economic development, and housing \n     purposes; or\n       (2) enter into an agreement with an appropriate public or \n     private entity to sell or lease the property and facilities \n     to such entity for such purposes.\n       (c) Description of Property.--The exact acreage and legal \n     description of the property conveyed under this section shall \n     be determined by a survey satisfactory to the Secretary. The \n     cost of the survey shall be borne by the District.\n       (d) Additional Terms and Conditions.--The Secretary may \n     require such additional terms and conditions in connection \n     with the conveyance under this section as the Secretary \n     considers appropriate to protect the interests of the United \n     States.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n\n                                        State of South Dakota,\n\n                                                November 15, 1995.\n     Mr. Wade Pehl,\n     Belle Fourche School District 9-1,\n     Belle Fourche, SD.\n       Dear Mr. Pehl: I am certainly pleased to lend my support to \n     the proposed acquisition of the Air Force Detachment 21 site \n     in Belle Fourche by the Belle Fourche School District. The \n     potential for public good is remarkable. Not only will it \n     address certain critical facility needs of the school \n     district, it will provide badly needed moderate income \n     housing for the Belle Fourche community. I am especially \n     pleased with the cooperative spirit that has been evident in \n     this project between the various local governments; it is \n     this type of cooperation that will provide innovative \n     solutions to many community challenges.\n       You and the entire board are to be commended for your \n     creativity in this matter.

A bill to make certain technical corrections in laws \nrelating to native Americans, and for other purposes; to the Committee \non Indian Affairs.\n\n\n                   technical corrections legislation\n\n Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I am introducing today a bill to \namend two existing laws that provide for the settlement of the water \nrights claims of two Indian tribes in Arizona.\n  Section 1 of the bill amends section 112 of the Yavapai-Prescott \nIndian Tribe Water Rights Settlement Act of 1994 to extend by 6 months \nthe time for the settlement parties to finish all actions required to \ncomplete the settlement. Under the original act, the Secretary of the \nInterior is required to publish in the Federal Register by December 31, \n1995, a statement of findings that includes a finding that contracts \nfor the assignment of Central Arizona Project water have been executed. \nDue to several unforeseen developments, the Department of the Interior, \nthe Yavapai-Prescott Tribe, and the city of Prescott have concluded \nthat additional time is necessary to finalize the agreements and \npublish the Secretary's findings in the Federal Register. Accordingly, \nthe amendment extends the deadline for completion of the settlement to \nJune 30, 1996.\n  Section 2 of the bill amends the San Carlos Apache Tribe Water Rights \nSettlement Act of 1992 to extend by 1 year the deadline for the \nsettlement parties to complete all actions needed to effect the \nsettlement, including finalizing agreements between the San Carlos \nApache Tribe and the Phelps-Dodge Corp., and between the tribe and the \ntown of Globe. This amendment would extend the deadline from December \n31, 1995, to December 31, 1996. The Department of the Interior, the San \nCarlos Apache Tribe, and the other settlement parties all support this \nextension.\n  Mr. President, it is extremely important that the Congress pass these \ntwo time-sensitive provisions before the end of the year. The San \nCarlos Apache and Yavapai-Prescott settlements are \n\n[[Page S 17669]]\nthe product of years of painstaking negotiation and effort by many \nparties. No party, in particular the United States, would benefit from \na lapse in the statutory authority for completing these settlements. \nWithout the time extensions contained in this bill, the many fruits of \nthese collective efforts could be lost.\n  On October 31, 1995, the Senate passed S. 325, a bill comprised of 22 \nsections containing amendments to various laws affecting native \nAmericans. Sections 1 and 2 described in the preceding paragraphs are \nidentical to sections 15 and 22 of S. 325. However, it now appears \ndoubtful that the House will pass S. 325 by the end of the year. \nConsequently, I am introducing this bill today to ensure that the \nparties to the San Carlos and Yavapai-Prescott settlements will have \nsufficient time to complete the work needed to make those settlements \nfinal.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url":

Mr. President, in going through the Congressional \nRecords I came across Senator Frank Murkowski's comments on Senate \nJoint Resolution 29.\n  In that resolution, he calls for dialog between North and South \nKorea.\n  Almost a year ago, Senator Murkowski and I visited North Korea and \nSouth Korea, and I applaud what he suggests in this resolution and his \nleadership on it.\n  Let me add that I believe the United States could be a facilitator of \nthis dialog.\n  Senator Murkowski and I sent a letter suggesting that North Korea \nsend 10 parliamentarians to the United States and South Korea the same, \nand that after visiting the United States for about 8 days, that the \nparliamentarians of both countries meet the last 2 days in an isolated \nsetting with a few of us who would be hosts from the United States.\n  Because of the tensions that have arisen since the death of Kim Il \nSung neither side was willing to take that step.\n  It is time to explore this again.\n  Nowhere in the world do you have as many troops facing each other, \nheavily armed, with a total lack of communication between the two \nsides.\n  The potential for explosion is very real and there are 140,000 \nAmerican troops on the South Korean side.\n  We would have an interest in resolving this even without the presence \nof those troops but that adds a meaningful dimension to this.\n  I am sending a copy of these remarks to the Assistant Secretary of \nState for Asia, Winston Lord.\n  I ask that the text of the resolution be printed in the Record.\n  The text of the resolution follows:\n\n                              S.J. Res. 29\n\n       Whereas the Agreed Framework Between the United States and \n     the Democratic People's Republic of Korea of October 21, \n     1994, states in Article III, paragraph (2), that \n\n[[Page S 17672]]\n     ``[t]he DPRK will consistently take steps to implement the North-South \n     Joint Declaration on the Denuclearization of the Korean \n     Peninsula'';\n       Whereas the Agreed Framework also states the ``[t]he DPRK \n     will engage in North-South dialogue, as this Agreed Framework \n     will help create an atmoshphere that promotes such \n     dialogue'';\n       Whereas the two agreements entered into between North and \n     South Korea in 1992, namely the North-South Denuclearization \n     Agreement and the Agreement on Reconciliation, Nonaggression \n     and Exchanges and Cooperation, provide an existing and \n     detailed framework for dialogue between North and South \n     Korea;\n       Whereas the North Korean nuclear program is just one of the \n     lingering threats to peace on the Korean Peninsula; and\n       Whereas the reduction of tensions between North and South \n     Korea directly serve United States interests, given the \n     substantial defense commitment of the United States to South \n     Korea and the presence on the Korean Peninsula of United \n     States troops: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the \n     United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, true dynasties in sports are hard to \ncome by these days. I am pleased to report, however, that a group of \nhigh school athletes and coaches in my State have achieved a special \nkind of success.\n  The Gilford Middle High School Golden Eagles varsity soccer team won \ntheir national record-setting ninth straight State championship on \nNovember 6. Senior All-American striker Kris Keenan finished off a \nbrilliant high-school career with the game's only goal. Keenan's goal \n10:06 into sudden-death overtime came at the expense of the Coe-Brown \nNorthwood Academy Comanches. The loss was the first of the season for \nthe Comanches, who had a tremendous season in their own right.\n  Winning the championship game extended Gilford's undefeated streak to \n100 consecutive games. The team's last loss occurred almost six full \nseasons ago. With four more wins at the start of the 1996 campaign, the \nGolden Eagles will hold this national mark, as well.\n  The one constant throughout this amazing string of success has been \nhead coach David Pinkham. Coach Pinkham came to Gilford in 1977, fresh \noff of his career as an All-American soccer player at Plymouth State \nCollege in Plymouth, NH.\n  In 19 seasons, Coach Pinkham has compiled a career record of 281-28-\n13. That is good for a .893 career winning percentage. Under his \ntutelage, the Golden Eagles have gone undefeated the past five seasons, \nand in seven of the past nine. Gilford's record since the beginning of \nits first championship season in 1987 is an incredible 152-2-7--.966.\n  Over the duration of his coaching career, Coach Pinkham's teams have \nscored almost seven and a half goals for every one of their opponents. \nBefore a scoreless tie earlier this year, his teams had not been shut \nout for 121 consecutive games. This too, may be a national record.\n  Gilford has made the playoffs 17 consecutive years and has advanced \nto at least the Class M State semifinals for 15 straight seasons. \nAmazingly, the last time it failed to make it to the final four--1980--\nsome members of this year's team had not yet been born.\n  The Golden Eagles have earned the respect of their opponents and \nfollowers of New Hampshire high school soccer not only for their \nathletic accomplishments, but also for the way they conduct themselves \non the field. Gilford's players work extremely hard for their success \nand play the game with a tremendous amount of pride and class. At the \nsame time, they show a great deal of respect for their opponents and \nthe game they love.\n  These attributes that produce so many on-field accomplishments are \nevident in the rest of the players daily lives, as well. The Gilford \ncommunity is rightfully proud of the dozens of fine young men produced \nby the Gilford soccer program.\n  Congratulations to Coach Dave Pinkham and the 1995 Class M State \nSoccer Champion Gilford Golden Eagles. On behalf of the citizens of the \nState of New Hampshire, I commend your outstanding \naccomplishment.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/11/28/senate-section/article/S17672-1", "month": "11", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "28", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S17672-S17673]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    THE DEATH OF HENRY J. KNOTT, SR.\n\n Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, with great sadness, I rise today \nto pay tribute to an extraordinary man. Henry J. Knott, Sr., died \nyesterday at the age of 89. For many decades, we knew him in Baltimore \nand throughout Maryland as a talented businessman and a philanthropist \nwhose generosity knew no bounds.\n  I first want to express my deepest condolences to his wife of 67 \nyears, Marion Burk Knott, his 12 children, his 51 grandchildren, and \nhis 55 great-grandchildren.\n  People in positions of power and responsibility should serve as role \nmodels for our young people and give something back to their \ncommunities. I have great admiration for people who have a sense of \ncivic responsibility, for people who try to make their community a \nbetter place to live.\n  Mr. Knott epitomized these qualities. Throughout his career, he \nsought to help those less fortunate than himself get a better education \nand lead better lives. He donated millions of dollars to Catholic \neducational institutions like his alma mater, Loyola College; Mount St. \nMary's College, Emmitsburg; the College of Notre Dame in Maryland; and \nthe University of Notre Dame in Indiana. He was especially generous to \nthe Institute of Notre Dame, a catholic high school both his daughters \nand I attended.\n  His legendary generosity extended well beyond education. He provided \nenormous help to health and cultural institutions as well. He donated \nessential funds to the Baltimore Symphony Orchestra, the Johns Hopkins \nOncology Center, and several Baltimore hospitals to help them establish \nan income fund to provide medical care for the poor.\n  His many business activities earned him a reputation as a highly \ndisciplined and hard-working person. But his civic and charitable \nactivities showed us that he was also an extremely modest person who \nhad very deep feelings for the Catholic Church, his community, and the \npeople around him.\n  In a 1987 Baltimore magazine article, he was asked about his \nprodigious philanthropy. He replied that making money was ``like \ncatching fish. You get up early. You fill the boat up with fish. And \nthen you give them all away before they start to rot.'' This quote says \na great deal about Henry Knott. He saw his wealth as a way to make life \nbetter for others. He never lost sight of this goal. \n\n[[Page S 17673]]\n\n  I mourn Henry Knott's death along with his family and the rest of \nMaryland. We will miss him greatly. However, I am very grateful that he \nwas with us for 89 years, and I rejoice that he left Maryland and our \nNation a better place than he found it.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/11/28/senate-section/article/S17672-2", "month": "11", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "28", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S17673]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       TRIBUTE TO PATRICIA WILBUR\n\n Mr. HATFIELD. Mr. President, it is unfortunately true that all \ngood things must come to an end. On November 30, 1995, one of the best \nmembers of my staff will retire. Patricia Wilbur joined the staff on \nOctober 7, 1973, and will soon be joining her husband Perry in a long-\ndeserved respite from the clamor of Capitol Hill.\n  Pat's career is a virtual survey of the technological revolution's \nimpact on the Senate. As my office's systems administrator, Pat has \nwitnessed the transition from typewriters and mimeograph machines, \nrotary phones and telegrams, to the world of faxes, pagers, cellular \nphones and computers. Pat has overseen this transformation with grace \nand humor as well as consummate professionalism.\n  The contribution of a good staffer often goes beyond their technical \nability. This is a especially true with Pat. Fondly known as Mrs. \nWilbur to several generations of staffers, Pat has helped shaped the \nlives of young Oregonians who wish to serve in the U.S. service \nacademies and helped us all to be more efficient in our jobs. Pat has \nadded to our hearts with her generosity and expressions of concern and \nadded to our waistlines with her delicious home-baked cakes.\n  During her 22 years in our office, Pat has been a laudable embodiment \nof hard work, dedication and loyalty.

Mr. President, Father Robert Drinan, former Member \nof the House, had a column in the National Catholic Reporter recently \nthat is of interest.\n  It points out where Catholics and Christian Coalition people can work \ntogether, and it is an area where liberals and conservatives can work \ntogether.\n  That is the growing problem of gambling.\n  I ask that the Robert Drinan column be printed in the Record.\n  The column follows:\n\n                  Two Sides Agree on Opposing Gambling\n\n                         (By Robert F. Drinan)\n\n       I was happy to discover recently that I agree with the \n     Christian Coalition on at least one issue: opposition to \n     gambling. Ralph Reed, the coalition's executive director (and \n     a Presbyterian who looks like an altar boy) says that his \n     organization may help finance an antigambling office in \n     Washington. Reed asserts that his organization is ``pounding \n     away'' at casinos and lotteries.\n       A conservative Colorado group named Focus on the Family is \n     also pushing an antigambling agenda. Gambling foes are \n     planning their first national convention in Florida. Keynote \n     speaker is Congressman Frank Wolf, a conservative Republican \n     from Virginia who is working aggressively against government-\n     sponsored gambling.\n       It is far from clear that any coalition of antigambling \n     groups can reverse the explosive growth of this form of \n     entertainment. Lotteries, casinos, riverboat gambling and an \n     ever-widening array of slot machines and other devices took \n     in $482 billion last year.\n       Substantial sums from that take have gone to Republicans, \n     including leading presidential candidates. Sen. Robert Dole \n     took in $477,450 from gambling interests in Las Vegas, Nev. \n     Sen. Phil Gramm of Texas has also benefited.\n       A further sign of entanglement: The former chairman of the \n     Republican National Committee, Frank Fahrenkopf, is now the \n     head of the American Gambling Association, the industry's \n     trade group.\n       Daily and vehemently, the new Republican majority in the \n     Congress proclaims agreement with the Christian Coalition on \n     abortion, school prayer and welfare. But when it comes to \n     gambling, the GOP is trapped between its devotion to the \n     Christian Coalition and its desire for campaign contributions \n     from the gambling industry.\n       Will the Christian Coalition use its newfound power in \n     Congress and some Southern states to reinstate laws against \n     gambling--laws that religious groups, Protestant and Catholic \n     alike, fought to get on the books a century ago?\n        A clash before next year's presidential election is \n     unlikely. Recognizing that the crusade against gambling is \n     all but a lost cause, even the most ardent adherents of the \n     Christian Coalition's agenda are not about to expend \n     political capital telling state lawmakers to abolish gambling \n     and tax their people fairly.\n       A further complication is that most Americans have never \n     really focused on gambling's evils. It appeared on the \n     American scene as a phenomenon that is odorless, invisible \n     and inaudible. Hardly anyone is angry or indignant.\n       Still, the potential for scandal and corruption in the \n     exploding gambling industry is so vast that almost anything \n     could happen.\n       The protests of the Christian Coalition against gambling \n     should be welcomed by all citizens and persons of faith. The \n     desire to get something for nothing and the fantasy that we \n     can be millionaires overnight are arguably the product of a \n     sinful heart.\n       Count of Catholics, Mr. Reed, for support. On this issue, \n     Catholics and the Christian Coalition are reading out of the \n     same prayer book.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/11/28/senate-section/article/S17673-2", "month": "11", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "28", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S17673-S17674]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              NURSING HOME QUALITY AND THE BOREN AMENDMENT\n\n Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, there has been considerable \ndiscussion on the Senate floor about the proposed changes to Federal \nnursing home quality standards.\n  In addition to making major cuts in projected Medicaid spending, \nearly versions of the 7-year budget plan would have repealed entirely \nthe nursing home standards adopted in 1987 as part of the Medicaid law. \nThe final House-Senate compromise bill recently adopted by the Congress \ndid not go that far, but it would weaken or eliminate several of these \nstandards and would allow States to get waivers from the remaining \nFederal requirements.\n  Several of my colleagues have come to the floor to remind the Senate \nof the conditions in some nursing homes which led to the adoption of \nthese standards in the first place.\n  Now I do not believe that all or even most nursing homes drugged or \nrestrained their residents unnecessarily before the quality standards \nwere put in place. Nursing homes in my State have a strong record of \nproviding quality care.\n  But it is undeniable that some nursing homes did engage in these \npractices. And it is also undeniable that some states were too slow in \nputting an end to this kind of abuse. Therefore, I continue to believe \nthat there should be minimum Federal quality standards, especially \nsince the majority of Medicaid funding for nursing homes comes from the \nFederal Government.\n  However, one critical point which has not received as much attention \nin this debate is the ability of nursing homes to maintain the quality \nof their care--Federal standards or not--in the face of significant \nreductions in Medicaid reimbursement. As we all know, the budget plan \nwould reduce by $163 billion future Federal funding for Medicaid. But \nthat is not all.\n  A little noticed provision of this plan to turn the Medicaid Program \ninto a block grant to the States is the repeal of the Boren amendment. \nThe Boren amendment currently requires States to provide reimbursement \nto hospitals and nursing homes which is reasonable and adequate to \ncover their costs. This has provided critical protection from state \nattempts to cut Medicaid reimbursement below levels necessary to \ndeliver quality care.\n  My fear is that repealing this protection is part of a deal with the \nStates so that they will accept significantly reduced Federal funding \nfor Medicaid. The budget proposal tells States to make due with less \nfunding, but it allows them to, in effect, shift that funding shortfall \nonto nursing homes and hospitals. Well it may make the numbers add up, \nbut what will it do to the care these institutions are able to provide \nto their patients?\n  So as we continue to debate the various changes which have been \nproposed to the Medicaid Program, let us not forget that Federal \nquality standards are not the only part of the Medicaid Program that \nimpact quality of care. The $163 billion in cuts, combined with the \nrepeal of the Boren amendment are also a great threat to the quality of \n\n\n[[Page S 17674]]\ncare received by Medicaid beneficiaries. I believe the Boren amendment \nmust be preserved in any final compromise on the budget, and I intend \nto fight to see that it is. \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/11/28/senate-section/article/S17673-3", "month": "11", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "28", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S17674]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO ISRAEL COHEN\n\n Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to a \ngreat man and a great friend. Late last Wednesday, Israel Cohen, the \nchairman of Giant Food, passed away at 83.\n  Mr. Cohen came to this country as a young boy and learned the grocery \nbusiness in his father's store on Georgia Avenue--one of the first \nself-service stores of its kind in the country. From this beginning, \nMr. Cohen built the Giant Food & Drug empire. In a rapidly changing \nretail food market, Mr. Cohen survived and prospered through \ninnovation. He experimented with selling items under private labels to \ncut costs and his stores were the first in the country to use scanners \nat the checkout counters.\n  Mr. Cohen was more than simply a successful businessman. He knew that \nthe success of his business was directly related to the health and \nwell-being of his employees. He was a man who always had time to visit \nwith his employees, no matter how busy he may have been. He created a \nfamily atmosphere with his employees, refusing to be called Mr. Cohen, \nbut insisting on Izzy. And he worked as hard for them as they did for \nhim. His employees tell of waiting around after putting in a full shift \nto meet and shake hands with him. Mr. Cohen recognized the value and \nimportance of every single worker at his stores, from the President of \nthe company to the high-schooler who bags groceries on Saturday \nafternoons.\n  Mr. Cohen was dedicated to providing the best service possible. Even \nif that meant he had to jump in behind a cash register and bag a \ncustomer's groceries himself. This is a lesson from which every \nAmerican should learn.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/11/28/senate-section/article/S17674-1", "month": "11", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "28", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S17674]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 ON THE ADVISABILITY OF NOT DEFAULTING\n\n Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, we have had a variety of sources \ntelling us that the Nation should not default on its obligations \nbecause of the debt limit.\n  It should hardly be necessary to stress that. If we create debt, we \nhave to pay for it. For that reason I have consistently--with one \nexception--voted for extending the debt limit whether it was a \nDemocratic President or a Republican President. The real choice is when \nwe create the debt. Once it is created we have to face up to it.\n  But a publication which probably has limited circulation that I have \ncome to respect is Grant's Interest Rate Observer, published by James \nGrant.\n  His November 10 issue has a front page commentary titled, ``On the \nAdvisability of Not Defaulting.''\n  It approaches the question of default from a slightly different \nperspective that I believe my colleagues should note.\n  I ask that the commentary be printed in the Record.\n  The material follows:\n\n          [From Grant's Interest Rate Observer, Nov. 10, 1995]\n\n                 On The Advisability of Not Defaulting\n\n       Over the past 12 months, the 30-year Treasury bond actually \n     delivered a higher total return than the stock market \n     (source: the authoritative center pages of this publication). \n     The margin of outperformance, 32.92% to 29.60%, was \n     remarkably strong for an asset class that is under the cloud \n     of default.\n       It would be better if there were no default, we think. Over \n     the past 46 years, according to our friends at Ryan Labs, \n     income contributed a little more than 100% of the total \n     return of the overall Treasury market. Thus, the contribution \n     of capital gains to the same calculation--the bear market \n     lasted for 34\\1/2\\ years, until September 1981--was less than \n     zero.\n       Because the bond is an income security, low interest rates \n     work a hardship on bondholders. Default would work the \n     ultimate hardship. To achieve the identical 32.92% total \n     return in the next 12 months, Ryan calculates, the current \n     30-year Treasury would have to rally to a yield of 4.59%. \n     Over the past five years, the long bond has produced a total \n     return of 12.35%; to reproduce that feat in the next five \n     years would require a rally to 3.60%. To match the past \n     decade's total return of 11.48%, the 30-year Treasury would \n     have to rally to 0.29%. Repeat: 0.29%.\n       Since May 1974, bonds have delivered 12-month total returns \n     in excess of those achieved by stocks in no fewer than 110 \n     months, a fact almost guaranteed to win a bar bet from any \n     stock market chauvinist who insists that the returns to \n     management, diligence, hard work and ingenuity should, by \n     right, exceed those to coupon clipping.\n       Perhaps the creditor class isn't finished yet. As the graph \n     on pages six and seven points up, bond market out-\n     performance is rarely a one-month flash in the pan; it \n     tends to roll on. But that is a question of relative \n     return. The immediate risk of default is one of absolute \n     performance, not in the short run but over the long pull. \n     One long-term risk is the precedent of default (to be \n     technical, this would be the second American default; in \n     1933, the government abrogated the contracts under which \n     it had promised to pay gold to its bondholders). A second \n     is that the temporary nonpayment of interest and principal \n     would cause intelligent people to reexamine the nation's \n     monetary institutions. Wondering about the whereabouts of \n     their money, they might turn to the Federal Reserve's \n     balance sheet. Reading it, they would observe: non-\n     interest-bearing currency on the liabilities side; \n     Treasury securities on the asset side. Their eyes would \n     flash to a footnote: $484 billion in Treasurys held in \n     custody by the Federal Reserve for the account of foreign \n     central banks.\n       A very intelligent American reader would come to appreciate \n     that he or she is the beneficiary of a vast fandango. The \n     world has willingly come to accept the promises of this \n     government, either in interest-bearing or non-interest-\n     bearing form. The half-trillion dollars or so worth of dollar \n     securities visibly held by foreign central banks constitute \n     the evidence not of American strength but of weakness. \n     Mainly, they represent the track of currency intervention. \n     Buying dollars, the central banks turn them in for U.S. \n     government securities. It is an indirect gift.\n       Another subversive feature of a Treasury default is that it \n     would turn the spotlight on other classes of non-interest-\n     bearing investments. Of these, perhaps none is so lowly as \n     gold, which this year has caused even its few remaining \n     friends to despise it. However, notes Peter McTeague, of MCM \n     TradeWatch, Boston, gold option volatility has collapsed, \n     speculators are short the market, central banks are hostile \n     toward it and producers continue to sell the metal forward \n     (the proof of which is a gold lease rate that has surged to \n     2.3% from 1.8% in the past month: even at the lower yield, it \n     would represent towering value in the Japanese bond markets). \n     On Tuesday came news that the output of the South African \n     mining industry is closing in on a 40-year low; a spokesman \n     for the Anglo American Corp. described the country's gold \n     operations as being in a ``state of managed decline.'' The \n     other day, a friend described his own growing, unfashionable \n     bullishness toward gold. However, he added before hanging up: \n     ``I'm not sure I want my name used with this.'' It has been a \n     vale of tears.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/11/28/senate-section/article/S17674-2", "month": "11", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "28", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S17674]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               COMMON SENSE PRODUCT LIABILITY REFORM ACT\n\n  Mr. PRESSLER.
