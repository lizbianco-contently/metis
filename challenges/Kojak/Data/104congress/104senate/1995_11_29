No person in recent history has done more to enable the \nSenate to be a family of caring people who support and encourage each \nother than Dr. Halverson.\n  Let us pray: Blessed living Holy God, Sovereign of this Nation and \nthis Senate, we thank You for the way that You enrich our lives by the \ngift of persons who care. We praise You for the life of Richard \nHalverson, for 14 years the Chaplain of this Senate. We praise You for \nhis integrity rooted in his intimate relationship with You that \nradiated upon his face and was communicated by his countenance. We \nthank You for the profound way that he cared for all of us and \nestablished deep relationships. He introduced people to You and helped \nthem to grow as persons.\n  We bless and praise You now, Lord, as You are here with comfort and \nencouragement for us. You are with his wife, Doris, his sons, Chris and \nSteve, and his daughter, Debbie. Put Your arms of love around them, \ngiving them hope.\n  Lord, we thank You this morning for the assurance that this life is \nbut a small part of the whole of eternity and that death is only a \ntransition in the midst of living for a man like Richard Halverson.\n  And so we thank You for him and praise You for Your enrichment of our \nlives through him. Through Jesus Christ, our Lord, Who has defeated the \npower of death and reigns forever.

RICHARD HALVERSON\n\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, as the Chaplain mentioned in his opening \nprayer, the Senate today is mourning the passing of Dr. Richard \nHalverson.\n  As all Senators know, Dr. Halverson served as our Chaplain from 1981 \nuntil his retirement earlier this year.\n  Throughout his service as Chaplain, Dr. Halverson was a friend and \ncounselor not only to Senators, but to the entire Senate family.\n  As many of my colleagues said upon Dr. Halverson's retirement, from \nSenate staffers to elevator operators to police force members to \nelectricians, it would be impossible to tell how many lives Dr. \nHalverson touched here on Capitol Hill.\n  He came to the Senate after many years of service to churches in \nMissouri, California, and Maryland. He was recognized worldwide as a \ngreat humanitarian and traveled extensively through his leadership of \nWorld Vision, the Campus Crusade for Christ, Christian College \nConsortium, and the prayer breakfast movement.\n  Mr. President, perhaps our colleague, Senator Nunn, said it best \nearlier this year when he called Dr. Halverson ``our friend, our \ncolleague, our mentor, our adviser and, most of all, our example.''\n  Later today, Senator Daschle and I will be submitting a resolution of \ncondolence to be delivered to the Halverson family. It is my intent to \ninclude all Members of the Senate as cosponsors of this resolution.\n  At this time, I ask unanimous consent that the Record stay open for \n15 days so that Senators may offer tributes to Dr. Halverson, and that \nthese tributes be printed as a Senate document.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Frist). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/11/29/senate-section/article/S17699-4", "month": "11", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "29", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S17699]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

RICHARD HALVERSON\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, the majority leader has just spoken for \nall of us. There is not a person in the Senate today who has not had \nthe good fortune to benefit from the friendship of Dr. Halverson.\n  Someone once said that life has no blessing like that of a good \nfriend. Dr. Halverson was a good friend to all of us. Rather than mourn \nhis death, it is appropriate to celebrate his life, because, indeed, it \nwas a celebration of joy, of blessing. It was a recognition that \nthrough his religious belief, emanating every morning as he came to \nthis Chamber, we all felt a little stronger, we all felt a little \nbetter, we all felt perhaps a little wiser, we all felt a little more \nable to work with each other. His contribution to his country and to \nthis body will last for a long, long time.\n  So today we celebrate his life. We send our condolences to his wife, \nDoris, and his family. We wish them the best. We recognize that in life \ncomes achievement, and with his achievement, we all are the better.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DOMENICI addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico. \n\n[[Page S 17700]]\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Parliamentary inquiry, is it appropriate that I speak \nfor 2 minutes?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, later on, pursuant to the wishes of our \nleader, I will have much more to say about Reverend Halverson. I \nconsidered him to be one of my best friends in the whole world, but \nmore than that, he cared for a lot of people. He was a true Chaplain, \nnot just up here, but in the Halls and byways and offices of this place \nwith families, with people who work for the Senate from the lowest paid \nto the highest paid. He took care of them.\n  He was very, very sick, particularly the last 3 weeks. I talked to \nhis wife, Doris, this morning, his son Steven. Chris, his other son, \nwas not there. It is kind of wonderful to see their expressions, \nbecause they obviously believe and they are very, very confident he is \nvery happy today and that he is in everlasting life. That is marvelous \nto see, because that is just the way he would want their faith to be.\n  So not only to that family, but to all his large family here and \neverywhere in this city, and other places that he served, I think I can \njoin with all of them in saying very simply that we thank God Almighty \nfor sending people like Dr. Halverson to us.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. CHAFEE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

RICHARD HALVERSON\n\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I think the words that we ``celebrate the \nlife of Richard Halverson'' are appropriate. Richard Halverson, as has \nbeen pointed out, served as Chaplain here for 16 years.\n  As has been mentioned, he did not restrict his duties to just the \nopening prayer. He came to see us when we had difficulties. He was a \nconstant mentor, as has previously been suggested, and a constant good \nexample. He epitomized what leading the Christian life is all about.\n  So we have been blessed to have known him. His life is one we all \nshould celebrate and try to emulate to the greatest extent possible. So \nto all of his family, we send our very best wishes at this extremely \ndifficult time, and our deepest condolences.\n\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

RICHARD HALVERSON\n\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, I join in the statements that have \nbeen made here this morning and say that our lives have been so \nenriched by Dr. Halverson. He was the U.S. Senate Chaplain, but he was \na friend of the Senators of this institution.\n  In our roles, so often we need to have that camaraderie, that \nfacilitator that can help us in finding that higher wisdom and the \ninner peace. Richard Halverson provided that to us. I know now that he \nhas that inner peace, and we share, as has been stated in the \nblessings, having him as part of our lives here.\n  Our prayers are with him, as well as with Doris, Chris, and all of \nthe family. We thank the Lord for providing him to us.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DOLE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

It is also possible that during today's session the Senate \nwill consider the VA-HUD appropriations conference report, if it is \nreceived from the House. I think it is fair to say that we will have \nrollcall votes. I understand that Senator Chafee will be indicating \nthere are a number of amendments. Some will require rollcalls.\n  We hope to complete action on the Safe Drinking Water Act, if not \nlate today, by some time late afternoon tomorrow. At that time, I hope \nto announce the schedule for the remainder of the week. It may be that \nthere may be a pro forma session only on Friday, or, if possible, we \ncould take up additional conference reports if received from the House.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/11/29/senate-section/article/S17700-4", "month": "11", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "29", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S17700]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds that--\n       (1) safe drinking water is essential to the protection of \n     public health;\n       (2) because the requirements of title XIV of the Public \n     Health Service Act (commonly known as the ``Safe Drinking \n     Water Act'') (42 U.S.C. 300f et seq.) now exceed the \n     financial and technical capacity of some public water \n     systems, especially many small public water systems, the \n     Federal Government needs to provide assistance to communities \n     to help the communities meet Federal drinking water \n     requirements;\n       (3) the Federal Government commits to take steps to foster \n     and maintain a genuine partnership with the States in the \n     administration and implementation of the Safe Drinking Water \n     Act;\n       (4) States play a central role in the implementation of \n     safe drinking water programs, and States need increased \n     financial resources and appropriate flexibility to ensure the \n     prompt and effective development and implementation of \n     drinking water programs;\n       (5) the existing process for the assessment and regulation \n     of additional drinking water contaminants needs to be revised \n     and improved to ensure that there is a sound scientific basis \n     for drinking water regulations \n\n[[Page S 17701]]\n     and that the standards established address the health risks posed by \n     contaminants;\n       (6) procedures for assessing the health effects of \n     contaminants and establishing drinking water standards should \n     be revised to provide greater opportunity for public \n     education and participation;\n       (7) in setting priorities with respect to the health risks \n     from drinking water to be addressed and in selecting the \n     appropriate level of regulation for contaminants in drinking \n     water, risk assessment and benefit-cost analysis are \n     important and useful tools for improving the efficiency and \n     effectiveness of drinking water regulations to protect human \n     health;\n       (8) more effective protection of public health requires--\n       (A) a Federal commitment to set priorities that will allow \n     scarce Federal, State, and local resources to be targeted \n     toward the drinking water problems of greatest public health \n     concern; and\n       (B) maximizing the value of the different and complementary \n     strengths and responsibilities of the Federal and State \n     governments in those States that have primary enforcement \n     responsibility for the Safe Drinking Water Act; and\n       (9) compliance with the requirements of the Safe Drinking \n     Water Act continues to be a concern at public water systems \n     experiencing technical and financial limitations, and \n     Federal, State, and local governments need more resources and \n     more effective authority to attain the objectives of the Safe \n     Drinking Water Act.\n\n     SEC. 3. STATE REVOLVING LOAN FUNDS.\n\n       The title (42 U.S.C. 300f et seq.) is amended by adding at \n     the end the following:\n\n                  ``PART G--STATE REVOLVING LOAN FUNDS\n\n\n                          ``general authority\n\n       ``Sec. 1471.

and\n       (C) determine--\n       (i) the type and nature of research that would likely \n     reduce the uncertainties; and\n       (ii) the cost of conducting the research.\n       (6) Consideration of benefits.--In carrying out this \n     section, the Administrator shall consider and, to the extent \n     practicable, estimate the monetary value, and such other \n     values as the Administrator determines to be appropriate, of \n     the benefits associated with reducing risk to human health \n     and the environment, including--\n       (A) avoiding premature mortality;\n       (B) avoiding cancer and noncancer diseases that reduce the \n     quality of life;\n       (C) preserving biological diversity and the sustainability \n     of ecological resources;\n       (D) maintaining an aesthetically pleasing environment;\n       (E) valuing services performed by ecosystems (such as flood \n     mitigation, provision of food or material, or regulating the \n     chemistry of the air or water) that, if lost or degraded, \n     would have to be replaced by technology;\n       (F) avoiding other risks identified by the Administrator; \n     and\n       (G) considering the benefits even if it is not possible to \n     estimate the monetary value of the benefits in exact terms.\n       (7) Reports.--\n       (A) Preliminary report.--Not later than 1 year after the \n     date of enactment of this Act, the Administrator shall report \n     to Congress on the sources of pollution and other Federal \n     actions that the Administrator will address, and the \n     approaches and methodology the Administrator will use, in \n     carrying out the rankings and evaluations under this section. \n     The report shall also include an evaluation by the \n     Administrator of the need for the development of \n     methodologies to carry out the ranking.\n       (B) Periodic report.--\n       (i) In general.--On completion of the ranking and \n     evaluations conducted by the Administrator under this \n     section, but not later than 3 years after the date of \n     enactment of this Act, and every 3 years thereafter, the \n     Administrator shall report the findings of the rankings and \n     evaluations to Congress and make the report available to the \n     general public.\n\n[[Page S 17719]]\n\n       (ii) Evaluation of risks.--Each periodic report prepared \n     pursuant to this subparagraph shall, to the extent \n     practicable, evaluate risk management decisions under Federal \n     environmental laws, including title XIV of the Public Health \n     Service Act (commonly known as the ``Safe Drinking Water \n     Act'') (42 U.S.C. 300f et seq.), that present inherent and \n     unavoidable choices between competing risks, including risks \n     of controlling microbial versus disinfection contaminants in \n     drinking water. Each periodic report shall address the policy \n     of the Administrator concerning the most appropriate methods \n     of weighing and analyzing the risks, and shall incorporate \n     information concerning--\n\n       (I) the severity and certainty of any adverse effect on \n     human health, the environment, or public welfare;\n       (II) whether the effect is immediate or delayed;\n\n       (III) whether the burden associated with the adverse effect \n     is borne disproportionately by a segment of the general \n     population or spread evenly across the general population; \n     and\n       (IV) whether a threatened adverse effect can be eliminated \n     or remedied by the use of an alternative technology or a \n     protection mechanism.\n\n       (d) Implementation.--In carrying out this section, the \n     Administrator shall--\n       (1) consult with the appropriate officials of other Federal \n     agencies and State and local governments, members of the \n     academic community, representatives of regulated businesses \n     and industry, representatives of citizen groups, and other \n     knowledgeable individuals to develop, evaluate, and interpret \n     scientific and economic information;\n       (2) make available to the general public the information on \n     which rankings and evaluations under this section are based; \n     and\n       (3) establish, not later than 2 years after the date of \n     enactment of this Act, methods for determining costs and \n     benefits of environmental regulations and other Federal \n     actions, including the valuation of natural resources and \n     intergenerational costs and benefits, by rule after notice \n     and opportunity for public comment.\n       (e) Review by the Science Advisory Board.--Before the \n     Administrator submits a report prepared under this section to \n     Congress, the Science Advisory Board, established by section \n     8 of the Environmental Research, Development, and \n     Demonstration Act of 1978 (42 U.S.C. 4365), shall conduct a \n     technical review of the report in a public session.\n\n     SEC. 29.

(a)''.\n\n  Mr. CHAFEE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, we now have before us the Safe Drinking \nWater Act amendments of 1995, which is S. 1316. I am pleased to join \nwith my colleagues to bring this bill to reauthorize the Safe Drinking \nWater Act. This legislation has broad bipartisan support. It has been a \nhigh priority for the Environment and Public Works Committee and was \nreported by unanimous vote; Democrats and Republicans in the committee \nvoted for it 16-0. \n\n[[Page S 17720]]\n\n  We all agree that reform of the Safe Drinking Water Act is necessary. \nPublic health protection has been strengthened by the many new \nstandards that have been issued over the past few years. Of all the \nways of keeping our public healthy, it seems to me few are more \nimportant than having the water that they drink be safe. But the pace \nof standard setting and the costs of new treatment and monitoring \nrequirements have been a strain for water suppliers, especially smaller \ncommunities.\n  This bill includes many provisions to ease that strain on the smaller \ncommunities. There is a new grant program for drinking water revolving \nloan funds, which President Clinton first recommended. The States are \nauthorized to reduce monitoring costs by developing their own testing \nrequirements, tailored to meet the conditions in their region. This is \nvery important. The States have this authority in this legislation.\n  Under this bill, States may also grant variances to the small systems \nthat cannot afford to comply with national standards. Now, we are not \nrolling back health protections that are now provided. No existing \nstandard will be weakened. The bill includes many new initiatives that \nwill keep the national program moving forward. In the SRF grants--the \nState revolving loan fund grants--there are new programs to prevent \npollution of source waters which are used for drinking water supply. \nThere is a program to develop technical capacity in small systems.\n  The bill pushes hard for more and better science, including a \nresearch program to determine whether some groups, like children, \npregnant women, or people with particular illnesses, are more likely to \nexperience adverse effects from drinking water contaminants.\n  Mr. President, before describing the major provisions of the bill, I \nwant to thank our colleagues for the hard work they have put into this \nlegislation.\n\n  Senator Kempthorne chairs the subcommittee that has jurisdiction over \nthe drinking water program. Senator Kempthorne is the principal author \nof this reauthorization bill and has spent months going over every \ndetail of the legislation. So Senator Kempthorne deserves tremendous \ncredit for what we are bringing before the Senate today. I wish to take \nthis opportunity to thank him.\n  Senator Reid, the ranking member of the subcommittee, has been a \npartner in that effort and always has been very constructive.\n  Senator Baucus, the ranking member of the full committee, blazed the \ntrail for us last year with the safe drinking water bill that passed \nthe Senate 95-3.\n  The committee was assisted in the development of this bill by the \nfine staff of the Office of Water at EPA, including the Assistant \nAdministrator for Water, Bob Perciasepe, and Cynthia Dougherty, who \nheads the drinking water office.\n  We also thank the many State and local drinking water officials and \nthe representatives of their organizations who worked long and hard on \nthis bill. Their expertise has been very helpful.\n  Mr. President, if we ask what is the one thing we can do that would \nmost improve the safety of drinking water in the United States, I \nbelieve most of us would answer: Give some help to the small drinking \nwater systems. If you can believe it, there are 54,000. I will repeat \nthat. There are 54,000 small public water systems in our country.\n  What is a small system? It is one that serves fewer than 3,300 \npeople. Some serve as few as 100 or 125 people, and some even 25 \npeople. Some of these drinking water systems are owned by homeowners \nassociations or trailer parks. Some are operated by town governments.\n  A significant number of these very small systems do not have the \ntechnical or financial resources to consistently provide safe drinking \nwater. They cannot keep up with the testing and the treatment and the \nmaintenance that is necessary to provide safe water every day. These \nare systems where the operator has no training, the consumers pay no \nfees for the water sometimes, and where the supply and distribution \nsystems simply do not get the attention that is needed to keep \ncontaminants out of the water.\n  The bill we are bringing before the Senate addresses this is problem \nin several ways. First, it establishes a grant program to provide \nFederal assistance to build the treatment plants that are essential to \nthe provision of safe drinking water. EPA estimates that capital \nexpenditures needed nationwide to comply with current requirements of \nthe Safe Drinking Water Act total approximately $8.6 billion, that is, \nif we brought all the systems up to snuff, and approximately 40 percent \nof these expenditures will be required of small systems. Many systems \nare not able to build the treatment facilities to comply with these \nregulations unless they get some help.\n\n  Other Federal statutes mandating investment in local utility services \nhave provided grant assistance to go along with the mandates. In other \nwords, when we mandated from the Federal Government for clean water \nbills, for example, the Congress, which has provided help, and, indeed, \nin that particular example, the building of sewage treatment \nfacilities, Congress has appropriated over the years $65 billion to \nmeet the secondary treatment requirements required by 1972 amendments \nto the Clean Water Act. We have not provided any sort of similar \nassistance under the Safe Drinking Water Act in the past.\n  In early 1993, President Clinton proposed creation of a State-\nrevolving loan fund for those funds for drinking water capital \ninvestments modeled after the Clean Water Act loans. This bill \nauthorizes $600 million in fiscal year 1994 and $1 billion per year \nthrough fiscal year 2003 for this new SRF Program. This authorization \nis sufficient to cover the capital investments in treatment needed to \ncomply with Federal health standards.\n  Priority funding would go to projects to address the most serious \npublic health problems and to communities most in need. Who will get \nthe money? Those communities that most need the help as determined by \nthe States--not by big brother in Washington, but by the States--and \nthose projects that needed to address the most serious health problems.\n  In contrast to the SRF Program under the Clean Water Act, States may \nprovide grants to systems. In other words, from this State-revolving \nloan fund in this bill, in safe drinking water the State can give \ngrants to systems that cannot afford to repay.\n  As a second step to help small systems, the bill asks each State to \nadopt what is known as a capacity development strategy to help the \nsmall systems.\n  What is this all about? A strategy might include training for the \noperators of drinking water systems, or technical assistance to develop \nnew and safer water supplies, or it might encourage consolidation or \nregional management to make better use of the resources. We are relying \non the States to take the lead in designing capacity strategies for the \nsmall systems.\n  This is not some heavyhanded mandate from Washington to the States, \nbut, instead, it is up to the States. We do not, from Washington, \nenforce the direction of operators who do not get training, for \nexample. But we suggest it be done and we give assistance to do it.\n\n  We are looking to the States, to the Governors, and to the \nlegislatures to take the big steps. Here is a chance to show that a \nmajor problem can be resolved by the States through cooperation and \nincentives rather than by command and control from Washington. The \nultimate judgment on the success or failure of this bill will depend in \nlarge part on what the States do with this opportunity.\n  There are several other provisions to help small systems. States are \nauthorized to grant variances to small systems that cannot afford to \ncomply with national primary drinking water regulations. A portion of \nthe SRF funds may be set aside for technical assistance, as I \nmentioned, to small systems, and the cost of training operators may be \nincluded in the SRF grants or loan.\n  States may reduce monitoring requirements. This is very important. \nThe States do not have to meet a certain steady monitoring system. They \ncan reduce those requirements for many contaminants for small systems \nthat do not detect a contaminant in the first test of a quarterly \nseries.\n  There are two other major provisions in this bill that I wish to \ndescribe briefly. The first relates to the criteria that EPA uses to \nselect contaminants for \n\n[[Page S 17721]]\nregulation. The second concerns considerations that go into \nestablishing national health standards. Because EPA failed to take \naction to set national standards for contaminants that were of public \nhealth concern, the 1986 amendments listed 83 specific contaminants and \nrequired EPA to set standards for those by 1989.\n  The legislation--here was a big problem with that legislation we \npassed--directed EPA to set standards for an additional 25 contaminants \nevery 3 years beginning in 1991.\n  This single provision--that is, adding 25 new contaminants every 3 \nyears--has provoked more critical comment than virtually any other \nelement that we have dealt with in all the environmental laws we have. \nSome of the 83 contaminants for which standards are required occur so \ninfrequently that the costs of monitoring far outweigh any health \nbenefits that could be realized.\n  The mandate that EPA set standards for an additional 25 contaminants \nevery 3 years, regardless of the threat posed by those contaminants, \nwas for many the quintessential example of an arbitrary Federal law \nimposing burdens on consumers and the taxpayers with no rational \nrelationship to the public benefit that might be realized. This bill \nrepeals the requirement that EPA regulate an additional 25 contaminants \nevery 3 years. Instead, there is a selection process that gives EPA the \ndiscretion to identify contaminants that warrant regulation in the \nfuture.\n\n  How do you do this selection process? Every 5 years EPA publishes a \nlist of high-priority contaminants that should receive additional \nstudy.\n  EPA may require monitoring at public water systems for up to 20 \nunregulated contaminants, to gather information on the occurrence of \nthese contaminants in public systems.\n  Decisions made by EPA under the act are to be guided by new \nprinciples for sound science.\n  EPA is to set aside $10 million from the annual appropriations for \nSRF, for the State-revolving fund grants, to conduct health effects \nresearch on contaminants that are candidates for regulation. In other \nwords, EPA gives a hand with all of this.\n  Every 5 years, EPA is to make regulatory decisions for at least 5 \ncontaminants, announcing whether they warrant regulation or not.\n  Finally, let me turn to the issue of standard setting. This has been \nthe most contentious issue in this reauthorization debate. I believe \nthe committee has developed a sound compromise that deserves the \nsupport of all Senators.\n  Under current law, EPA establishes drinking water standards through a \ntwo-step process. First, the administrator identifies the maximum \ncontaminant level goal reflecting a concentration of the contaminants \nin drinking water at which no adverse effects will occur.\n  Then, the administrator sets an enforceable standard as close to this \nabsolutely safe goal as possible, as feasible. ``Feasible,'' what does \nthat mean? That the level can be reached by large regional water \nsystems applying best available technology.\n  In other words, what is the policy to meet these goals. We do not use \nwhat the little systems can do, but what the big systems can do. EPA \ntakes into account the costs to identify the best available technology.\n  The treatment system must be affordable. What is affordable? Well, \nthey use the standard that it costs less than $100 per household per \nyear for the large systems.\n  Now, this approach is all right because 80 percent of the \npopulation--this is a very important statistic--80 percent of the \npopulation of the United States receives its drinking water from large \nsystems. Safe water can be provided to this 80 percent at an affordable \ncost. They can afford the best available technology. Indeed, the \ncompliance cost for large cities average not $100 per household, but \n$20 per household per year.\n  However, there is a problem with this system. There are three \nproblems. First, the treatment technology affordable to the large \nsystems may be unaffordable to the small system and would push the per \nhousehold cost way up for these small systems.\n  Second, for some contaminants, this approach to standard setting can \nimpose large costs while producing only small gains in public health. \nAlthough the treatment technology may be entirely affordable for the \nlarge systems, the incremental health benefits of addressing the \nrelatively small health risk presented by some contaminants do not \njustify the aggregate cost. It is just not worth it for the small \nsystems because the benefit you get is so small for the cost.\n\n  Third, the use of some treatment technologies may actually increase \nrisk from some contaminants. For example, chlorine is used to kill \npathogenic organisms, but that may result in increased cancer risk from \ndisinfection byproducts. In other words, you take care of something and \nit causes a greater risk of something else.\n  Now, read literally, the existing statute requires EPA to overcontrol \nsome contaminants to a degree that overall public health risks from \ndrinking water would be greater using this new technology. The bill we \nbring to the Senate today includes several provisions to respond to \nthese problems in standard setting.\n  The States may provide variances to small systems. If it is all right \nfor the big system, not very expensive because you have so many \nhouseholds, the States can say to the small systems: No, you do not \nhave to do that. We give you a variance. EPA may balance competing \nrisks from several contaminants if the treatment technology to control \none would increase the risk from the other, which I just previously \nmentioned.\n  EPA may set standards at a level less stringent than ``feasible'' if \nthe costs of a standard reflecting best available technology are not \njustified. In other words, this is not somebody in EPA saying you have \nto reach this standard even though the costs are astronomical. Costs \ncan be figured in. There is a cost-benefit factor involved here. The \nunique characteristics and risks of some contaminants, including \narsenic, radon, or sulfate, are addressed with special standard-setting \nprovisions. Although the bill includes new risk assessment and cost-\nbenefit considerations to address unresolved problems, EPA may not use \nthis authority to relax any existing standard unless new science \nindicates that a less stringent standard would be equally protective.\n  It appears we have secured broad bipartisan support for a series of \nreforms to this act, a law that has, indeed, been controversial. \nAchieving this reflects the contributions of many Senators, as I \nmentioned. Reaching this degree of consensus has generated much \ncontroversy, and the fact that we have this unanimity so far is quite \nan achievement.\n  So, again, I congratulate Senator Kempthorne for his work. I know he \njoins me in extending appreciation to Senator Reid, Senator Baucus, and \nall the others I previously mentioned.\n  We are ready to go, Mr. President. I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, first of all, I want to inform the Senate \nthat the manager of the bill, Senator Baucus, is temporarily away from \nthe floor and will return shortly.\n  The bill before this body is, of course, the Safe Drinking Water Act \nAmendments of this year, 1995. This legislation, I believe, is Congress \nat its finest. What I mean by that is that this is a bill that is \nbrought to this point by building consensus. It was not easy. It was \ndifficult. But I think the people in the State of Rhode Island, the \npeople in the State of Montana, the people in the State of Idaho are \nwell served with the way their Senators handled this legislation.\n  Whether we like it or not, legislation is the art of compromise. \nLegislation is the art of consensus building, and that is what this \nlegislation is all about. This bill is not everything that I like. It \nis not everything, I am sure, that my colleagues, the Senator from \nIdaho and the Senators from Montana and Rhode Island, think is a \nperfect bill. But it is a good bill. It is a tremendous improvement \nover anything we have been able to do before.\n  Where there has been rancor among the parties on other items before \nthe Senate, and even in our committee, this bill has been negotiated \nfor the better part of a year and as a result of the negotiations, we \nhave come up with this fine piece of legislation. This is a bipartisan \neffort. The Senate will address the drinking water problems of \n\n[[Page S 17722]]\nthis country in this legislation and, as a result of this bill \npassing--and I have every belief it will pass--the people of this \ncountry will be well served by having the assurance that the water they \nare drinking is safe.\n  I recognize, as I have indicated, that not everyone is going to be \ntotally happy with what is in this legislation. But it is a good, \nsound, reasonable, rational piece of reform legislation. This is truly \nreform legislation. I support the bill for lots of reasons, but let me \nmention just a few of them.\n  This bill, all Members of the U.S. Senate should realize, represents \na balance. It is a balance that has been reached, and I think it has \nbeen done with great thought and consideration. There is no question \nthat we must begin with the presumption that water in the United States \nis not necessarily safe if you drink it. There are increasing threats \nof contamination and pollution.\n  I can remember, as a young boy, we would drive once in a while down \nto the river, the Colorado River. My father told me something that was \ncertainly true in those days, that if the water was running, it was \nsafe, you could drink it, because as the water progressed it was \ncleansed as it proceeded through the rocks and the pebbles and the \nbushes--it was clean. That is not the case anymore. Things are put in \nwater so that the mere fact that it is running no longer makes it safe. \nI cannot tell my children the same thing my father told me about having \nsafe drinking water.\n  So there are increasing threats of contamination and pollution. That \nis what this legislation is all about. The bill provides for drinking \nwater standards and the means by which drinking water systems can meet \nthe standards. Again, I repeat, this legislation is to allow people, \nwhen they drink water in the United States, to feel they are drinking \nsafe water, that the contaminants have been removed and there are \nprocedures to make that water safe.\n  The bill incorporates sound science into the Administrator's \ndecisionmaking and contaminant regulations. The bill establishes, \nimportantly, as has been clearly explained by the chairman of the \ncommittee, a revolving loan fund to assist drinking water systems in \ncomplying with drinking water standards. In accordance with the \nUnfunded Mandates Act, which the Senator from Idaho worked so hard in \naccomplishing, it establishes money for States and drinking water \nsystems to help comply with the act. I think we should all be very \ncareful of amendments that come on the floor today, that we do not \nviolate what we have worked so hard to accomplish in this legislation; \nthat is, we are not going to force upon the States and local \ngovernments things that they do not have the money to comply with. I \nthink that should be the watchword of the amendments that are offered \nhere today. We truly meant what we said when we passed the unfunded \nmandates legislation very early this year.\n  Even technical assistance funds for the small drinking water systems \nare provided for in set-asides. Additionally, States and local \nauthorities are given greater flexibility, as, again, was explained so \nwell by the chairman of the committee. States and local authorities are \ngiven greater flexibility in the implementation and development of \ntheir capacity development strategies. The bill also equips the \nEnvironmental Protection Agency with greater flexibility in setting \ndrinking water standards that were based on peer-reviewed science, with \nthe benefits and risks associated with contaminants. The Environmental \nProtection Agency will be focusing its scarce resources on important \nhealth risks that are grounded in valid science rather than spending \nall their time, effort and money on matters that really did not allow \nfor us to arrive at the conclusion it was necessarily better water to \ndrink.\n  I also want to make a few observations about the Environmental \nProtection Agency. I believe this agency has served this country well. \nIt has been maligned, but wrongfully so, in my estimation. I do not \nthink we should be passing laws out of fear of antagonism to an agency. \nI think this agency has had a noble mission, one part of which is to \nmake sure that we have safe drinking water. We all recognize that \nreform and change must occur, and that is what they are doing with this \nlegislation. I emphasize to my colleagues, there are certain things the \nAdministrator has already initiated, reforming the Environmental \nProtection Agency generally.\n  The Safe Drinking Water Act Amendments of this year should not be \nabout agency procedures and management, nor should the Safe Drinking \nWater Act be about regulatory reform issues that have dominated so much \nof the debate this year. This bill is about drinking water, about the \nwater that we drink, our children drink, and our children's children \nwill drink. That is what we should be talking about during this debate \non this legislation: Will water be safer as a result of this \nlegislation passing? That is, the drinking water that we all partake \nof, will it be safer as a result of this legislation?\n  This bill, I think, should either protect the drinking water of the \nhomes and communities of this Nation, or we should not be here. I \nbelieve the chairman of the full committee, the ranking member, the \nchairman of the subcommittee and the ranking member, feel very strongly \nthat this is good legislation that will make the water we drink safer.\n  There are other reasons I support this legislation. There are many \nsmall systems in Nevada, hundreds of small systems in Nevada. These \nsystems must also be such that the water that comes out of those \nsystems is safe drinking water.\n  Five years ago, on November 16, the President, President Bush, signed \na very important bill. It settled a 100-year water war between the \nStates of California and Nevada. It preserved the wetlands that had \nbeen in existence for up to 10,000 years, some 80,000 acres that had \nbeen drawn down to less than 1,000 acres and were very toxic in nature. \nWe resolved that and resolved the problems of two Indian tribes, two \nendangered species, some agricultural problems we had, and solved some \nwater problems for the cities of Reno and Sparks.\n  I mention how complicated that was, but the most difficult problem we \nhad in the entire legislation was not the things I mentioned. It was \nnot endangered species. It was not the wetlands. It was not all the \nother things I talked about. It was in the Lake Tahoe basin, in \nCalifornia and Nevada--it was what we did about those little water \ncompanies. Some of them were so small, as the chairman of the committee \nmentioned, they served 25 people. In Lake Tahoe there were over 100 \nwater companies. In some of them the systems were so bad they had to \nleave the water running all year or the lines would freeze up. This \nlegislation will allow those small water systems to have the assurance \nthere will be safe drinking water. We are not going to force them into \ndoing anything.\n  Since that time, a number of those companies have merged. We do not \nhave the myriad of problems we had before. But, even if we did, this \nlegislation takes into consideration small water companies like are in \nthe Tahoe basin. So this legislation really, I believe, addresses the \nproblems of rural America.\n  We, in Congress, address the problems of big cities. We spend almost \nall of our time on big cities. The State of Nevada, surprisingly, is \nthe most urban State in America. Mr. President, 90 percent of the \npeople in Nevada live in the metropolitan areas of Reno and Las Vegas. \nYet we are the seventh largest State of all the 50 States. We have 73 \nmillion acres. But most of the land is not where most of the people \nare. Those people outside Reno and Las Vegas need the assurance they \nare going to have safe drinking water. I was born and raised in \nSearchlight, NV. It is a very small place. It is getting bigger. If you \ntake all the little communities around Searchlight, they have 1,000 \npeople. We want to make sure the people of Searchlight have safe \ndrinking water. This legislation does that. This legislation really \ntakes care of rural America. It does not neglect rural America or urban \nAmerica as we do many times.\n\n  Is this good legislation? I think it is important legislation. It is \nreasonable reform. It benefits the communities and ensures the health \nand safety of Americans. It is legislation that is--I repeat--\ncompromise legislation. This is not just a catchy phrase. But this is \nreasonable reform, and it is true reform.\n  Mr. President, I extend my congratulations to the chairman of the \nfull \n\n[[Page S 17723]]\ncommittee, and ranking member, and also the chairman of the \nsubcommittee that I have worked with. He has been very reasonable. We \nhave not agreed on everything all year, but he has made every effort to \nreach out to the rest of the subcommittee to make sure that we have all \nthe input that we feel is necessary.\n  I say this with the tremendous difficulty which we are having now \nwith all the money things--the continuing resolution and extending the \ndebt limit. I think people, especially in the other body, can take a \nreal lesson from what this legislation is all about. I do not think \nthere is anyone that I have come across that has had stronger \nprinciples in the legislative process than the Senator from Rhode \nIsland, and certainly the Senator from Idaho, but they have had to \ncompromise in this legislation.\n  I say to the people in the other body as we are grinding down trying \nto work things out in the last few weeks of this legislative session--\neveryone, Democrat and Republican alike--that they can look at this \nlegislation and say there is hope for the money problems we have in \nthis country, if they follow as an example what we have done here.\n  This is true reform, and I think it is legislation that is at its \nbest. I am happy to have been a part in this bill arriving to the point \nwhere it is now. This is good legislation.\n  I ask the Members, both Democrats and Republicans, to support this \nlegislation.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho is recognized.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, I am pleased to stand here today in \nsupport of the Safe Drinking Water Act Amendments of 1995. I believe \nthat this is a strong bill, that will improve public health, give \nStates and local governments the authority and flexibility they need to \ntarget their scarce resources on high priority health risks, and lay \nthe foundation for a safe and affordable drinking water supply into the \n21st century.\n  Mr. President, this legislation is long overdue. Over the past year, \nI have heard from dozens of State and local officials, consumers, \nrepresentatives from industry and even EPA. Their perspectives are \ndifferent, but their message was a shared one: Virtually everyone \nagrees that the current law simply does not work. It does not target \nthose contaminants most likely to be found in drinking water; it does \nnot ensure that standards are set based on the best available, peer-\nreviewed science; and it does not provide States and local governments \nwith the tools that they need to ensure that citizens have safe and \naffordable drinking water.\n  Jeffrey Wennberg, the mayor of Rutland, VT, said it best.\n\n       There is no public health responsibility of greater concern \n     to local elected officials than the provision of consistently \n     safe, plentiful, and affordable drinking water. This is the \n     only product or service that we provide that directly affects \n     the health and well-being of every one of our constituents \n     every day. Unfortunately, the Safe Drinking Water Act, as \n     amended in 1986, has often confounded our efforts to meet \n     this responsibility.\n\n  Federal policy makers agree. Former EPA Deputy Administrator Robert \nSussman summed it up when he acknowledged that:\n\n       Safe Drinking Water Act implementation has harmed the \n     agency's credibility by becoming a potent symbol of the \n     rigidity and costliness of Federal mandates on local \n     governments and the overprotectiveness of the EPA standard \n     setting process. Reforms should strive for maintaining \n     environmental protection while achieving more flexibility in \n     priority setting, lower compliance costs, and greater state \n     and local involvement in decision making.\n\n  Many of the concerns raised by critics of the Safe Drinking Water Act \nare the direct result of unrealistic and in many cases overzealous \nmandates imposed by the 1986 amendments to the Safe Drinking Water Act. \nThese amendments, although well-intentioned, went too far to one \nextreme--command and control regulation took the place of common sense. \nWith the Federal Government at the helm, we imposed rule after rule on \nState and local governments, requiring them to spend literally billions \nof dollars to comply with burdensome Federal standards, often with \nlittle or no consideration of the true nature of the risk to public \nhealth, the cost of compliance, or the availability of less intrusive \nalternatives.\n  Yet, while we are asking States and local governments to devote \nscarce resources to safeguard against potentially remote risks, we are \nignoring more immediate and real risks to public health and safety. In \n1993, for example, a known disease-causing agent--cryptosporidium--\ncontaminated the drinking water supply in Milwaukee, WI. Over 400,000 \npeople became sick and 104 people died from the cryptosporidium \noutbreak. There have been other outbreaks of cryptosporidium \ncontamination since then. Cryptosporidium was not regulated in 1993 and \nit still is not in 1995. Clearly, current law is not adequately \nprotecting the public from true health threats. We need to do better. \nAmericans should not get sick from their drinking water. It is time to \nchange direction.\n  The bill we are here today to debate responds to the legitimate \nconcerns that have been raised and provides important midterm \ncorrections to a regulatory scheme mired in ill-focused, often \nunjustified and certainly costly mandates. It reflects months of \nnegotiations with various stakeholders and the efforts of many of my \ncolleagues, particularly Senator Chafee, the chairman of the Senate \nEnvironment and Public Works Committee, with whom it is a great \npleasure for me to work, and I appreciated the comments he made in his \nopening statement this morning; Senator Baucus, the ranking member of \nthe committee; Senator Reid, the ranking member of the Senate \nSubcommittee on Drinking Water, Fisheries and Wildlife, of which I am \nthe chairman. The partnership that Harry Reid and I have been able to \nforge I think suggests that there will be other successes which will \ncome forward from that subcommittee, and I greatly appreciated his kind \nwords this morning.\n  I also want to acknowledge Senator Kerrey of Nebraska, who has been \ninstrumental in the negotiations over drinking water reform. He was a \ncatalyst toward a bipartisan effort here today. I appreciate the \nefforts of all of these individuals and the assistance over the past \nyear.\n  In drafting this legislation, we were guided by three fundamental \nprinciples. First and most importantly, we wanted not only to preserve \npublic health, but also to improve it. Second, we wanted to strengthen \nthe partnership between the Federal Government and State and local \nofficials who are primarily responsible for providing safe and \naffordable drinking water. And third, we would impose no unfunded \nmandates. The bill that is before the Senate today satisfies each of \nthese principles.\n  Let me highlight a few of the key concepts of the legislation.\n  First, the legislation substantially strengthens current law to \nensure that all Americans have safe and affordable drinking water. It \nrevises the standard setting process so that the Administrator is no \nlonger required arbitrarily to identify and regulate 25 new \ncontaminants every 3 years. Instead, the Administrator is given the \nauthority and flexibility to target her regulatory resources on those \ncontaminants that are actually present, or likely to be present, in \ndrinking water, and that, based upon the best available peer-reviewed \nscience, are found to pose a real risk to public health. Once the \nAdministrator has identified a contaminant of concern, the bill \nrequires that she evaluate several regulatory options, taking into \nconsideration both the benefits of each option and the real costs that \nwill be borne by those responsible for complying with any new \nstandards.\n  Our intent was simple. Drinking water standards should not be set \njust because they are technologically feasible as they are under \ncurrent law; they must also be justifiable. If we are going to demand \nthat our states, counties and towns spend billions of dollars to comply \nwith new chlorine standards, for example, at the very least, we owe \nthem the assurance that these are dollars well spent. We must be \nparticularly sensitive to this when we apply, as we do in the Drinking \nWater Act, new standards to small communities that must already comply \nwith and pay for numerous other Federal regulations. For example, one \ntown in my home State of Idaho, McCall, with a \n\n[[Page S 17724]]\npopulation of approximately 2,000, must invest in a new wastewater \ntreatment plant, a new filtration system, and make improvements in its \ninfrastructure to deliver drinking water. As one community leader told \nme, ``We've seen a 500-percent increase in our sewer rates, and we're \nstruggling. If we have to go back and raise rates again, or float a \nbond, or whatever it takes to finance compliance with Federal \nrequirements, we need to know that what we're being asked to do makes \nsense in terms of public health protection.'' As a former Mayor, I \nshare his concerns.\n  By targeting scarce resources on regulating contaminants that truly \nthreaten public health, and by tailoring drinking water standards to \nmaximize the benefits of regulation for the cost, we increase the \noverall level of protection that we offer everyday users of drinking \nwater.\n  The legislation also recognizes that in many cases, it is easier and \nmore cost effective to prevent contaminants from getting into source \nwater for a drinking water system, rather than to try to remove them by \nregulation after they are in the system. This bill encourages States to \ndevelop source water protection partnerships between community water \nsystems and upstream stakeholders to anticipate and solve source water \nproblems before they occur. These are voluntary, incentive-based \npartnerships. Our experience in my home State of Idaho has repeatedly \ndemonstrated that these kinds of programs work, and work well. Locally-\ndriven solutions that stakeholders themselves develop in a non-\nregulatory, nonadversarial setting will often achieve a far greater \nlevel of protection than otherwise through mandatory restrictions on \nland use or other regulations dictated by Federal agencies within the \nbeltway. The bill's voluntary source water protection program provides \nanother tool for States and local governments to improve public health, \ntarget local risks, and maximize resources.\n  The legislation also strengthens the existing partnership between the \nFederal Government and the States in implementing the Safe Drinking \nWater Act. It preserves the strong role for the Federal Government in \ndeveloping drinking water standards, but for the first time gives \nStates the flexibility to tailor Federal monitoring and other \nrequirements to meet their specific needs. This is just good common \nsense. It makes no sense, for example, to require Idaho drinking water \nsystems to spend thousands of dollars to monitor for a pesticide that \nmay be used only on citrus crops.\n  The legislation also provides needed relief through a variance \nprocess to small, financially strapped systems. These systems, in \ncertain circumstances, may use alternative, affordable treatment \ntechnologies that do not achieve full compliance with federal \nstandards, provided that they achieve an overall level of improvement \nin their drinking water. These types of system specific adjustments are \nimportant because they allow States and local governments to target \ntheir scarce resources to achieve the greatest overall level of \nprotection.\n  One of the most significant elements of this legislation is the \ncommitment for the first time of Federal resources to assure that the \nnation's drinking water supply is safe. The legislation authorizes up \nto $1 billion annually for a State revolving loan fund, which the \nStates then match with an additional 20 percent. These funds will be \navailable to States and local drinking water systems to construct \nneeded treatment facilities to comply with Federal standards. We \nrecognize that many communities simply cannot advance the funds that \nare needed to respond to new regulations. The Federal loan fund gives \nthem the initial boost that they need.\n  Importantly, the legislation also authorizes approximately $53 \nmillion for health effects research, including research on the health \neffects of cryptosporidium and disinfectants, and their potential \neffect on sensitive groups, like pregnant women, children, and those \nwith serious illnesses. I believe that this research is essential to \nensure that we continue to target our regulatory resources on true \nthreats to public health, while making sure that we never let another \ncryptosporidium outbreak take us by surprise.\n  While flexibility, sound science, and reduced costs may be the \nwatchwords of this legislation, it bears noting that the one term that \nyou will not hear in connection with this bill is ``unfunded mandate.'' \nThe 1986 Safe Drinking Water Act, by way of contrast, is the classic \nexample of a Federal unfunded mandate that this Congress overwhelmingly \nrejected when we passed the Kempthorne-Glenn Unfunded Mandates Reform \nAct this year.\n  Using the 1986 law as a case study of an unfunded mandate, the \nCongressional Budget Office just last month issued a report which found \nthat:\n\n       State and local officials have voiced strong opposition in \n     recent years to the growing number of Federal requirements. \n     At the local level, environmental requirements are perceived \n     to be particularly onerous, and the Safe Drinking Water Act \n     is often cited as one of the most burdensome requirements.\n\n  The report concluded that the average cost of compliance with \nexisting drinking standards is between $1.4 billion and $2.3 billion \nper year. It went on to note that compliance costs could increase \nsubstantially as a result of four proposed regulations that EPA is \ncurrently considering. In fact, compliance with just one of these \nproposed regulations alone--the so-called disinfectants and \ndisinfection by-products rule--could cost drinking water systems as \nmuch as $2.6 billion dollars per year once it is fully implemented. \nMost systems cannot afford these kinds of costs, particularly since the \nCBO study makes it clear that it is extremely uncertain that these \ncosts will reduce health risks.\n   Even without the Federal commitment of funds, there are in fact \nfewer mandates to fund than under current law.\n  The Congressional Budget Office has confirmed that this legislation \ndoes not impose unfunded mandates under the Unfunded Mandates Reform \nAct. In its analysis of this legislation, the CBO stated that the \nlegislation's standard setting provisions, including the risk \nassessment and cost benefit language would ``lower the cost of \ncompliance for local water systems.'' The CBO concluded that ``the bill \nwould likely result in significant net savings to state and local \ngovernments.''\n  Make no mistake about it. This bill will work. It will improve public \nhealth and reduce our costs at the same time. Do not just take my word \nfor it, though. Listen to those who are responsible for providing safe \ndrinking water. They overwhelmingly support this legislation.\n  The National League of Cities has said that the legislation:\n\n       will strengthen and revise the current law to assure that \n     limited government resources are targeted on contaminants of \n     public health concern that are actually found in the nation's \n     drinking water supplies . . . The measure is creative and \n     innovative in that for the first time it establishes a \n     funding source to assist communities.\n\n  The American Water Works Association:\n\n       believes that this legislation is a major step forward in \n     the direction of better public health; safer drinking water; \n     and more responsive government. The sensible reforms \n     contained in this bill represent a common sense solution that \n     supports both environmental protection and regulatory reform.\n\n  The Association of Metropolitan Water Agencies has praised the \nlegislation, stating that it:\n\n       opens the door on a new era of Federal lawmaking, where the \n     Federal Government, States, and local government and the \n     public entities responsible for implementing the law, can \n     work together to solve problems that impact the entire \n     Nation.\n\n  Even the EPA agrees. EPA Administrator Carol Browner recently \nappeared before the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee and \ntestified that the agency is looking for a new drinking water law that \n``will strengthen public health protection; provide improved regulatory \nflexibility; promote preventive efforts to keep the pollution and \ncontamination out of our drinking water in the first place; and provide \npublic funding to help communities upgrade their drinking water \nfacilities.'' This legislation, in her words, provides a ``framework \nand is a step in the right direction'' to achieve these important \ngoals.\n  In conclusion, Mr. President, we have taken an important step forward \nin improving the way in which we regulate drinking water. Does this \nlegislation solve all the problems? Of course not. But it will bring \ncommon sense back into the standard setting process, \n\n[[Page S 17725]]\nmake it easier for states to comply with the most important \nrequirements, streamline the bureaucracy, and reduce overall costs to \nmost systems. And it will do all of this without jeopardizing public \nhealth. That is an achievement that we should all be extremely proud \nof.\n  I hope that you will join me and Senator Chafee, Senator Baucus, \nSenator Reid, and Senator Kerrey in taking this first step and support \nthis legislation.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BAUCUS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Kempthorne). The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator Levin \nbe added as a cosponsor of the bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, today, the Senate begins consideration of \nS. 1316, a bill to reauthorize and reform the Safe Drinking Water Act.\n  We all understand the need to reform the Safe Drinking Water Act. It \ncontains a number of provisions that are too rigid and too costly.\n  At the same time, we must protect public health. After all, this is \nnot some theoretical exercise. We are talking about the water that we \nand our children drink. Two quarts a day, every day of our lives.\n  To my mind, this bill strikes the right balance.\n  It will reduce regulatory burdens. Unnecessary regulations, redtape.\n  At the same time, it will not jeopardize public health. In fact, in \nseveral important ways, it will increase protection of public health.\n  Before turning to details, I would like to take a few minutes to put \nthis legislation in perspective.\n  Mr. President, Americans expect to be able to turn on the tap, fill a \nglass, and drink the water--without getting sick. They expect safe \ndrinking water in their homes and in their local communities.\n  They expect safe drinking water when they move to a new community. \nThey expect safe drinking water when they travel.\n  When people from Conrad, MT visit Billings, Spokane, or Boston, or \nwhen people come to visit their nation's capital, they expect to be \nable to drink the water without getting sick or without the worrying \nabout getting sick.\n  Ever since 1974, the Safe Drinking Water Act has guided Federal, \nState and local efforts to assure that the water Americans drink is \nclean and pure. In the last several years, however, there has been \ngrowing concern that some provisions of the act misdirect Federal \nresources.\n  There also has been concern that the act imposes regulatory burdens \nthat local water systems simply cannot comply with, no matter how hard \nthey try. More specifically, critics of the act point to several flaws:\n  Local officials who operate drinking water systems, especially small \nsystems, are buried under a mountain of redtape. The operators of these \nsystems are trying to provide a basic public service to their \nneighbors. The job is difficult enough without monitoring requirements \nthat cannot be met.\n  There is another problem: Technology costs have skyrocketed. Again, \nthis is particularly a burden on those who operate small systems in \nrural areas.\n  These small systems have what the economists call limited economies \nof scale. They cannot spread their costs across a large number of \nratepayers. Nevertheless, in many cases, it costs them just as much to \ncomply with the law as it costs large urban systems who do spread their \ncosts.\n  On top of all of this, the standards-setting system in current law \nkeeps rolling along, with 25 new contaminants regulated every 3 years, \nwhether they are needed or not. And we have not provided federal funds \nto help communities meet their increased obligations.\n  Because of all these problems, it seems that the Safe Drinking Water \nAct has become the very symbol of concern about unfunded mandates.\n  But we have to get beyond symbolism, to solutions.\n  That is exactly what this bill does.\n  Senator Chafee, Senator Kemp-thorne, Senator Reid and I have been \nworking closely, with Senators on both sides of the aisle, with the \nAdministration, with the environmental community, and with State and \nlocal groups.\n  As a result of this work, the bill before us today, S. 1316, makes \nsignificant improvements in the law.\n  It creates a new State revolving loan fund for drinking water. It \nreforms the standards-setting process and the monitoring requirements. \nIt lightens the burdens on small communities, while continuing to \nprotect public health.\n  It also addresses risk. We have had a lot of debates about risk \nassessment this year.\n  Risk assessment is not a magic answer to all our problems. But it can \nbe an important tool, applied to specific problems.\n  This bill does that, by applying risk-based concepts to contaminant \nselection and standard-setting.\n  Mr. President, our Chairman, Senator Chafee, has described the \nprovisions of the bill ably and in detail.\n  I would simply like to emphasize three features of the bill that I \nconsider particularly important.\n  First, the bill creates a new revolving loan fund. We all talk about \nunfunded mandates. With this bill, we put some money where our mouths \nare.\n  The biggest problem facing drinking water systems, especially small \nsystems, is the lack of funding to build adequate treatment facilities. \nThey simply cannot afford to comply with the current requirements of \nthe act.\n  To address this, the bill establishes a State Revolving Loan Fund \nsimilar to the Clean Water Act revolving fund.\n  The money can be used by all States to help communities comply with \ndrinking water standards, restructure their operations, or find \nalternative sources of water.\n  The fund is authorized at a level of $600 million in fiscal year \n1994, and thereafter at $1 billion annually through fiscal year 2003.\n  Initially, grants for the drinking water State revolving funds will \nbe distributed according to the formula currently used to allocate \nFederal grants to States for drinking water oversight programs.\n  Beginning in fiscal year 1998, funds will be distributed according to \nthe results of an EPA survey of drinking water needs.\n  Another thing about the SRF. It provides flexibility. States can \nrespond to their own needs. They can provide grants to disadvantaged \ncommunities. They can offset a program shortfall.\n  They can help local water systems develop customized monitoring \nprograms and source water programs.\n  And they can shift funds between their clean water or drinking water \nrevolving loan funds, in order to meet their most pressing problems.\n  So we provide both funding and flexibility.\n  A second important feature is the bill's reform of the regulatory \nprogram.\n  For example, one of the most troublesome requirements, in all of our \nenvironmental laws, is the requirement that EPA regulate 25 additional \ndrinking water contaminants every 3 years, whether or not those \ncontaminants really threaten public health.\n  As a result, EPA is required to issue regulations that may impose \nhigh costs for little public health benefit.\n  The bill replaces that requirement with a new provision requiring EPA \nto periodically review the need to regulate additional contaminants. \nThat way, we can focus our limited resources on the most important \nproblems.\n  The bill also reforms monitoring requirements, the standard setting \nprocess, and other elements of the law.\n  In each case, the objective is to focus our resources on the most \nimportant problems.\n  The third important feature is special help for small community water \nsystems.\n  In the country as a whole, more than 85 percent of the drinking water \nsystems in this country are small.\n  In my home state of Montana, 688 of the 694 community water systems \nserve less than 10,000 people, and there is not one system serving more \nthan 100,000 people.\n  While small systems only serve about 10 percent of the people, they \nbear about 40 percent of the cost of the Safe Drinking Water Act.\n  The bill provides special help to small systems that cannot afford to \n\n\n[[Page S 17726]]\ncomply with the drinking water regulations and can benefit from \ntechnologies geared specifically to the needs of small systems.\n  Here is how it would work. Any system serving 10,000 people or fewer \nmay request a variance to install special small system technology \nidentified by EPA. What this means is that if a small system cannot \nafford to comply with current regulations through conventional \ntreatment, the system can comply with the act by installing affordable \nsmall system technology.\n  Small systems that seek a variance will be protected from financial \npenalties while their application is being reviewed, and they would \nhave 3 years to install the affordable technology.\n  States approve the variance, but only if the technology provides \nadequate water quality and public health protection.\n  So small systems are not forced to use big city treatment. But they \nmust fully protect public health.\n  Another way that this bill provides help to small systems is through \ntechnical assistance. Many small systems just need some advice on how \nto meet some of the requirements of the law or operate equipment. For \nexample, the Rapelje water system in Yellowstone County, MT was advised \nthrough the technical assistance program in our State to install a \npressure relief valve in its system, an action that will save the \nsystem a considerable amount in repairs.\n  This bill recognizes the importance of the technical assistance \nprogram for small systems by increasing the authorization for the \nprogram and allowing the States to use up to 2 percent of their SRF \nmoney for small system technical assistance.\n  Mr. President, putting all this together, the bill provides funding, \nreforms regulations, and recognizes the special problems of small rural \nsystems.\n  But in doing so, it does not relax existing standards or weaken \nprovisions of the act that are necessary to protect public health.\n  In fact, in addition to allowing EPA, States, and local communities \nto target resources to the greatest threats, the bill improves the \nact's enforcement and compliance provisions.\n  And it improves the important provisions that require water system \noperators to alert people about drinking water problems in their \ncommunities, especially problems that create health threats.\n  In summary, Mr. President, this bill is good news indeed.\n  And not only because it improves the Safe Drinking Water Act.\n  There is another reason. This bill shows that we can get something \ndone around here.\n  During this Congress, most debates about the environment have \ndeteriorated into pitched partisan battles. Both sides have hardened.\n  As a result, we have missed several opportunities to enact \nreasonable, balanced reforms that reduce regulatory burdens while \nimproving environmental protection.\n  The bill before us today is a refreshing exception. Republicans and \nDemocrats have worked together, cooperatively. Sure, it has taken time. \nThere have been painstaking negotiations. There has been compromise.\n  But look at the result. We have been able to develop a bill that will \nresult in meaningful reforms.\n  A bill that will protect public health. And a bill that the public \ncan, with confidence, support.\n  I want to thank Senators Chafee, Kempthorne, and Reid for the work \nthey have done to get this bill where it is today--unanimously reported \nfrom the Environment and Public Works Committee with more than 30 \ncosponsors.\n  I also want to thank the Administration and others for their hard \nwork and spirit of cooperation.\n  And I look forward to working with all of my colleagues to pass this \nbill through the Senate and enact it into law.\n\n  Mr. President, here we are passing a very complicated, very important \nbill which dramatically affects a lot of small communities, and \ncertainly every American, and yet there are very few Senators on the \nfloor. There does not seem to be a lot of interest by some Senators to \nbe here on the floor for this bill. Why is that? Basically, Mr. \nPresident, it is because this legislation, in addressing a real need, \nis done the right way.\n  What do I mean by the right way? I mean not demagoging the issue. \nSenators on both sides of the aisle have worked very, very hard, \nparticularly with interest groups around the country that were very \ninterested in addressing drinking water problems in our Nation--small \ncommunities, large communities, Governors, mayors, environmental \ngroups. And these groups, in trying to find a solution to the tradeoff \nbetween, on the one hand, protection--making sure our water is safe \nand, on the other hand, regulation, that is, not requiring too much \nregulation, trying to find the balance. We have done just that; we have \nfound a balance.\n  They have worked very, very hard. They have rolled up their sleeves. \nThey have worked together to get the job done. And we are here today \nbasically ratifying, putting together, that mutual effort of a lot of \ncompromise on the part of a lot of people. That is often what happens \naround here. Those who really work hard and get the job done are not \npraised as much as they should be.\n  In this case, it is all the various groups and people. It is also the \nchairman of the committee, Senator Chafee, the present occupant of the \nChair, Senator Kempthorne, who chairs the subcommittee, also Senator \nReid, the ranking member of the subcommittee, and many other Senators \nwho worked very hard, and their staffs particularly worked very hard to \nget their job done.\n  Now, what is the problem? What is the problem that this legislation \naddresses? Essentially, Mr. President, the problem is this. Over the \nyears, Americans have become more and more demanding, as they should, \nthat their water is safe. In 1986, they became quite concerned that the \nEPA, the administration at that time, was not quite doing the job that \nshould have been done to make sure that our water in our country was \nsafe. So the 1986 amendments to the Safe Drinking Water Act were \npassed. They were well-intended. They were amendments which directed \nthe Environmental Protection Agency and directed States to \nsignificantly increase their standards, impose many more monitoring \nrequirements. There were many more contaminants of concern identified \nthan the EPA was setting standards for.\n\n  Essentially, to help reassure Americans, because the job was not \ngetting done, we passed the 1986 amendments. I think it is fair to say \nthat the 1986 amendments that Congress passed went too far. They went \ntoo far in requiring the Environmental Protection Agency and the States \nto set too many standards, to regulate too much, to monitor too much \nand, basically, did not address the essential problem, that is, how to \nassure safer water at an affordable cost.\n  For example, one of the provisions in the 1986 amendments was \nessentially to say, ``OK, EPA, we want you to set standards for at \nleast 83 different contaminants.'' Up to that point, I think there were \nabout 22 contaminants regulated. ``We want you to set standards for a \ntotal of 83, and beyond that, we want you, EPA, to set standards for 25 \nadditional contaminants every 3 years.'' That is stupid. It is nuts. \nThere is no way in the world any agency could begin to do that much, \nwith a tremendous additional burden on the Environmental Protection \nAgency.\n  In addition, Mr. President, what was another consequence? Another \nconsequence was the dramatic disproportionate cost for smaller \ncommunities. Let us just think a minute. If the EPA tells a water \nsystem in a community to monitor certain contaminants, and to set \ncertain standards, and to essentially apply certain technology, \nregardless of the size of the system, it is very clear that the large \ncities are able to spread those costs out among many, many more people, \nso the cost per household is much lower. But if the very same \nmonitoring requirements, the very same standards, and the very same \nrequirements are imposed on smaller communities, it is clear there is \nno way in the world that a smaller community is going to be able to \nmeet those very same standards, those very same requirements, without \nimposing a tremendous cost on individual households in that small \nsystem.\n  That is particularly a problem, Mr. President, in my State of \nMontana. We \n\n[[Page S 17727]]\nhave about 698--I think that is the figure--community water systems. Of \nthose, I think about 660--I hope my figures are right--are communities \nof under 10,000 people. We are a small-system State, which means that \nthe 1986 amendments imposed tremendous disproportionate requirements on \nsmall communities.\n  These are communities that want safe water. Sure, they want clean \nwater. They want to do their best to make sure the water in their \ncommunities is just as safe, if not safer, than in big cities. But, my \ngosh, they are required to monitor for contaminants that do not exist. \nI have to tell you, monitoring may not sound like much, but it is very, \nvery expensive to monitor for an individual contaminant. You multiply \nthat for additional contaminants that may not be there--the law \nrequires you to monitor for them anyway, spend the money anyway. It \ndoes not make any sense. In addition, the technologies that have to be \ninstalled are that much more expensive.\n  Another big problem that the 1986 amendments created is a problem \nthat you heard many times from many people: unfunded mandates. That is \nUncle Sam saying, ``OK, community, you do this, you are going to take \nthese requirements, but we are not going to give you the money for \nit.'' It just was not fair.\n  As the occupant of the chair knows, this Congress, quite correctly, \nover the months earlier this year passed legislation to prohibit \nunfunded mandates. If my memory serves me correctly, one of the chief \nproponents of that legislation is the Senator from Idaho, and I commend \nhim for it.\n  This bill tries to address that problem by setting up a State \nrevolving loan fund. It is $600 million the first year, and then it \ngets to $1 billion. It basically says, ``OK, States, we are going to \nchange some of the requirements we passed in 1986. In addition to that, \nwe are going to provide funds in the State revolving loan funds so \nsystems can pay for some of the costs to install these technologies.''\n  We are also saying to the States, ``Boy, you have lots of \nflexibility. You can pass money between the Safe Drinking Water Act \nrevolving loan fund and the clean water revolving loan fund. You also \ncan set up a technical assistance program to help smaller communities, \neven a grant program for smaller communities.'' There is a lot of \nflexibility here, as it should be.\n  I will not take too much more time. Let me say, this is an example \nwhere Government is working. Government does not always work--we all \nknow that--but sometimes Government does work. Here is a situation \nwhere Government can work. It may not be perfect. There are probably \nsome areas where this legislation could be improved upon on the margin, \nbut mainly, it is a very good, solid effort to find a commonsense, \nbalanced solution to assure Americans that their water in their \ncommunities is safe and affordable.\n\n  That is what this bill does. It accomplishes this result, because a \nlot of very good people have worked very, very hard, and they have not \ndemagogued it and gone to the media. They just rolled up their sleeves \nand got the job done.\n  I particularly commend the chairman of the committee, Senator Chafee. \nHe has been the captain of the ship. He is at the helm. He set the \ntone, the mood and the approach to all this. We are here because he has \ndone that.\n  I very much hope--and this is the point the Senator from Nevada made \nearlier--that we can take this as an example or a paradigm of how to \ndeal with other problems around here. As the Senator from Nevada \npointed out, we are now locked in budget negotiations, a pitched \nbattle, Republicans and Democrats, the Congress and the White House.\n  Basically, Americans just want us to get the job done. They want us \nto compromise. They want us to balance the budget within 7 years, but \ndo it fairly, do it evenhandedly, so all Americans are participating \ntogether as we get the job done together, just as we have done in this \nbill.\n  Mr. President, this bill is a basic, commonsense, balanced solution \nof compromises, give and take, on both sides. We are getting the job \ndone. I very much hope that the White House, I hope that the Congress, \nand, to be totally candid about this, I particularly hope the other \nbody, particularly the majority party of the other body, in good faith \nsits down in these budget negotiations and compromises to get the job \ndone.\n  In summary, Mr. President, I want to particularly thank some \nMontanans who have worked very hard on this legislation over the years. \nThe first that comes to mind is Dan Kyle. Dan Kyle sat down with me at \nthe Heritage Inn in Great Falls, MT, I guess 6, 7, 8 years ago, talking \nabout how horrendously expensive it is, inappropriately expensive, for \nsmall systems to meet the Federal requirements. That was a long time \nago. Dan Kyle has labored in the vineyards. He has worked very, very \nhard--I believe he is head of the Montana Rural Water Association--\nalong with Ray Wadsworth and the rest of the Montana crew, and Jim \nMelsted. I know these same people exist in other States. I only know \nthose three in Montana, and they have been just terrific. I want to \ncompliment them particularly for their hard work. They are pretty proud \nthat finally we got the job done.\n\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. CHAFEE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, first, I want to thank the distinguished \nranking member of the committee, Senator Baucus, for his kind comments. \nI know that we all share the sentiments that we work together to get \nsomething done. We are very fortunate in this committee to have a \nheritage, if you will, of cooperation. It has extended way back to \nJennings Randolph and then to Bob Stafford, to Senator Pat Moynihan, \nand to the distinguished Senator from Montana himself when he was \nchairman of this committee. We have always tried to bring things out \nwith bipartisan consensus, so we can move ahead. This legislation \nrepresents that.\n  I am very pleased to be chairman of this committee when we have this \nheritage that I mentioned, and I want to pledge to all that I will \ncontinue that effort to bring everybody together, listen to each side \nand then have something--we will not always be as successful as this, \n16 to 0 in the committee, not a single dissenting vote from either \nside. That is what we want to use as a standard for the future.\n  When the distinguished ranking member was chairman of the committee \nand brought this bill to the floor a year ago, it passed 93 to 3. It is \npretty hard to beat that. If we can emulate that today or tomorrow, I \nwill be very, very happy.\n\n\n                     Committee Amendments, En Bloc\n\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the committee \namendments be adopted, en bloc, and that the bill, as amended, by the \ncommittee amendments then be considered original text for the purpose \nof additional amendments.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  So, the committee amendments, en bloc, were agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3068\n\n  (Purpose: To authorize listing of point-of-use treatment devices as \nbest available technology, modify loan authorities for the SRF program, \n clarify the definition of public water system, and for other purposes)\n\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I send a managers' amendment to the desk \nand ask for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Rhode Island [Mr. Chafee], for himself, \n     Mr. Kempthorne, Mr. Baucus, and Mr. Reid, proposes an \n     amendment numbered 3068.\n\n  Mr. CHAFEE.

Mr. President, let me briefly say what this is. The \nmanagers' amendment does the following: It clarifies the new definition \nfor the term ``public water system.'' It strengthens standard setting \nfor bottled water as recommended by the bottled water industry. It \nallows EPA to list more cost-effective, point-of-use treatment devices \nas best available technology; it includes Lake Champlain in the program \nto control the infestation of zebra mussels in the Great Lakes; it \nauthorizes assistance to a university consortium called the Southwest \nCenter for Environmental Research and Policy; it requires EPA to \nconduct a screening program for the estrogenic effects of pesticides, \nand it makes two changes to the loan provisions of the new SRF program, \nState revolving loan fund program. Overall, it clears seven issues that \nSenators have brought to our attention.\n  So, Mr. President, I urge adoption of the managers' amendment.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, these provisions under the managers' \namendment are essentially technical and clarification amendments, which \nSenator Chafee, myself, Senator Reid, and the occupant of the chair I \nknow has also looked at. I think they are good improvements to the \nbill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the amendment is agreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 3068) was agreed to.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3069\n\n(Purpose: To require additional research prior to the promulgation of a \n                         standard for sulfate)\n\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I send an additional managers' amendment \nto the desk and ask for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Rhode Island [Mr. Chafee], for himself, \n     Mr. Kempthorne, Mr. Baucus, and Mr. Reid, proposes an \n     amendment numbered 3069.\n\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n       Beginning on page 61, line 11, strike all through page 62, \n     line 16, and insert:\n       ``(A) Additional research.--Prior to promulgating a \n     national primary drinking water regulation for sulfate the \n     Administrator and the Director of the Centers for Disease \n     Control shall jointly conduct additional research to \n     establish a reliable dose-response relationship for the \n     adverse health effects that may result from exposure to \n     sulfate in drinking water, including the health effects that \n     may be experienced by groups within the general population \n     (including infants and travelers) that are potentially at \n     greater risk of adverse health effects as the result of such \n     exposure. The research shall be conducted in consultation \n     with interested States, shall be based on the best available, \n     peer-reviewed science and supporting studies conducted in \n     accordance with sound and objective scientific practices and \n     shall be completed not later than 30 months after the date of \n     enactment of this paragraph.\n       ``(B) Proposed and final rule.--Prior to promulgating a \n     national primary drinking water regulation for sulfate and \n     after consultation with interested States, the Administrator \n     shall publish a notice of proposed rulemaking that shall \n     supersede the proposal published in December, 1994. For \n     purposes of the proposed and final rule, the Administrator \n     may specify in the regulation requirements for public \n     notification and options for the provision of alternative \n     water supplies to populations at risk as a means of complying \n     with the regulation in lieu of a best available treatment \n     technology or other means. The Administrator shall, pursuant \n     to the authorities of this subsection and after notice and \n     opportunity of public comment, promulgate a final national \n     primary drinking water regulation for sulfate not later than \n     48 months after the date of enactment of this paragraph.''.\n\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, let me explain this amendment. What it \ndoes is it modifies the standard-setting provisions of the bill for one \ncontaminant, sulfate.\n  What is sulfate? It is a naturally occurring substance that \ncontaminates some groundwater used for drinking water, particularly in \nthe Western States.\n  The 1986 amendments required EPA to issue a standard for sulfates. It \nis one of the 83 contaminants we previously discussed. But EPA has not \ncompleted the job yet. Part of the problem has been inadequate \nscientific information on the adverse health effects caused by sulfate. \nWe know that adverse effects occur, but we do not know exactly what \nconcentration levels must occur to cause the effects.\n  This amendment requires EPA and the Centers for Disease Control to \ncollect more information before a standard is set. The amendment also \ndelays the deadline for issuing a standard so that this research might \nbe completed. Senators Pressler and Daschle from South Dakota and \nSenator Grams from Minnesota have expressed particular interest in \nresolving the scientific questions associated with sulfate, and we \nthank them for their interest and help in preparing this amendment.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, we have examined the amendment and think \nit is a good improvement. I urge its adoption.\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Mr. President, I rise today to commend Chairman Chafee, \nSubcommittee Chairman Kempthorne, and Senator Baucus, as ranking member \nof this committee, for their hard work in drafting this bill. \nCertainly, we need a uniform system of Federal laws and regulations to \nmaintain the public health and safety of our drinking water. These laws \nmust be reasonable. They must make sense.\n  The bill before us, S. 1316, would go a long way to bring common \nsense to safe drinking water regulations. This is good news for small \ncities and rural communities. For example, S. 1316 would require the \nEPA to provide sound scientific background for future drinking water \nstandards. In addition, this legislation would grant flexibility to \nsmall water systems that cannot always afford the expensive treatment \ntechnology to comply with Federal regulations.\n  S. 1316 represents a reasonable approach to drinking water \nregulation.\n  I am particularly pleased that my colleagues agreed to improve the \noriginal language in section 9, regarding the levels of sulfates \nallowed in drinking water supplies. This original provision would have \nrequired that communities provide bottled water as an alternative to \nwater containing sulfate. This provision is similar to a proposed \nEnvironmental Protection Agency regulation that would require \ncommunities to limit sulfate in drinking water. However, there is no \nscientific study to prove that these low levels of sulfate in drinking \nwater result in negative health affects.\n  As originally drafted, the bill would have affected roughly one-\nquarter of all the water systems in South Dakota--108 of the 483 water \nsystems in the State. The South Dakota Department of Environment and \nNatural Resources [DENR], which opposed both section 9 and the EPA's \nproposed sulfate rule, has estimated that the costs of compliance for \nthose affected water systems would have been 40 to 60 million. That was \njust the initial cost of compliance. Small, rural communities in South \nDakota should not be forced to pay such a high price to enforce a \nregulation that has no valid scientific justification.\n  Let me put these figures in real terms we can all understand. The \nlargest of the 108 affected South Dakota communities would have been \nMadison, with a population of 6,395 people. Currently, the average \nwater bill for each household in Madison is $13.75 per month. According \nto the South Dakota DENR, if the original section 9 were enacted, the \nadditional cost to each household would have been almost $14 per month. \nThat would have meant an average monthly water bill of $27.75--a 101 \npercent increase. Remember, this figure is for the largest of the \naffected communities.\n\n  Let us take Big Stone City, SD, as another example. With a population \nof \n\n[[Page S 17730]]\n670 people, Big Stone City has the median population of the 108 \ncommunities in South Dakota affected by the original sulfate proposal. \nCurrently, the average monthly water bill per household in Big Stone \nCity is $9.80. If the original section 9 were to become law, each \nhousehold in that community would have seen its water bill rise about \n$12.00, for a total monthly bill of $21.80. That would be a dramatic \n122 percent increase. Just imagine the impact this provision could have \non communities even smaller than Big Stone City.\n  Mr. President, what would these communities have gotten in return for \nthese shocking rate increases? Nothing. That is right. Nothing. For \nyears, South Dakotans have been drinking water containing sulfate with \nno apparent adverse health effects.\n  In response to the concerns of my constituents, my colleagues on the \ncommittee agreed to suspend the current EPA rule. Instead, additional \nresearch conducted jointly by the Centers for Disease Control and the \nEPA would be required on the health affects of various dose levels of \nsulfate in drinking water on the broader population. The EPA then would \npropose a new regulatory standard for sulfate based on the findings of \nthis study, and on the standards set forth by this bill.\n  I am convinced that this additional study will prove once and for all \nthat the sulfate which occurs naturally in much of South Dakota's \ndrinking water causes no harmful side affects. The revised sulfate \nprovisions of section 9 also have received the endorsement of the South \nDakota Department of Environment and Natural Resources, and the South \nDakota Municipal League.\n  Mr. President, like all Americans, South Dakotans certainly want safe \nand healthy drinking water. But they also want Federal rules that are \nreasonable, understandable and flexible.\n  By passing this bill, we are finally taking much-needed steps to \nsolve the problems associated with the current safe drinking water law. \nI am happy that I was able to work with the chairman to develop \nsensible language to reduce the impact of burdensome sulfate \nregulations on small cities and rural water systems in South Dakota and \nother States.\n  Again, I thank Chairman Chafee for his leadership and for \naccommodating the concerns of my constituents. I also want to thank my \nfriend from Minnesota, Senator Grams, for working with me to ensure \nthat we achieve a commonsense legislative solution on this matter.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 3069) was agreed to.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, my staff has been working with the \nfloor leaders on S. 1316, the Safe Drinking Water Act, relative to an \namendment which has been discussed at some length. I am sure the \nchairman of the Environment and Public Works Committee will respond to \nthe status of the amendment. But it would authorize the administrator \nof the Environmental Protection Agency to make grants. May I check with \nthe floor leader relative to the status of my amendment authorizing the \nAdministrator of the Environmental Protection Agency to make grants to \nAlaska to improve rural sanitation by paying the Federal share, 50 \npercent, of the cost of those improvements?\n  I would like to offer the amendment, if the leader has not offered it \nand speak very briefly on it.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, the Senator from Alaska had two amendments \nand both of those, it is my understanding, could be resolved and \naccepted. Frankly, we are in the midst of working that out now.\n  Why not go ahead and describe the amendment, and at the conclusion of \nthe Senator's description maybe we can arrive at a position where the \namendment could be accepted.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. President, my amendment authorizes the Administrator of the \nEnvironmental Protection Agency to make grants to Alaska because of the \nunique rural sanitation conditions in my State. It would improve rural \nsanitation by assisting with the Federal share--50 percent--of the \ncosts of specifically two items. One, the development and construction \nof water and wastewater systems, and second, the training, technical \nassistance, and educational programs relating to the operation and \nmanagement of sanitation services.\n  The purpose of the amendment is to ensure future funds are provided \nto improve Alaska's rural sanitation conditions. Our delegation--\nSenator Stevens, Representative Young, and myself--have supported $15 \nmillion in the EPA's budget this year for rural sanitation, and Senator \nStevens on the Appropriations Committee has obtained appropriations in \nprevious years. The problem we have is that the residents of rural \nAlaska simply do not have adequate drinking water or sanitation \nfacilities. As a consequence, we have an abnormally high amount of \nsickness and disease, and on some occasions, conditions can be compared \nto some Third World countries, unfortunately.\n  It is estimated that about one-fourth of Alaska's 86,000 Native \nresidents live without running water and use plastic buckets for \ntoilets. These are commonly called ``honey buckets.'' As a consequence, \nMr. President, we have had numerous cases of hepatitis A among \nvillagers, in some instances causing death.\n  I have a chart here which depicts the level of existing wastewater \nservices in rural Alaska communities, and as the Chair will note the \narea in dark blue indicates about 49 percent of the chart, which is the \narea of the population dependent on pit privies or honey buckets; 37 \npercent have flush toilets; 14 percent have a haul system where the \nhoney bucket man comes once a week and hauls the sewage away.\n  In over half of the villages in Alaska, water is hauled to the home \nby hand from a washeteria, watering points, or from a creek or river. A \nwasheteria is a centrally located community building with washing and \ndrying machines, showers, and so forth. Often times, Mr. President, the \ntrash can is used as a water storage tank. Water for drinking, hand \nwashing, and doing dishes comes from this household trash can, and you \ncan imagine the potential for disease as a consequence of that type of \ntransmission. Existing water service levels in rural Alaska have \nimproved, but they have a long way to go. Only 40 percent of rural \nAlaska has piped water to residents; 30 percent use a washeteria; 20 \npercent use a year round watering point; 7 percent have individual \nwells, and 3 percent have no system at all. One can imagine the \nresidents of this city living without the convenience of running water \nor toilets that flush.\n  In conclusion, I will continue to work to provide safe drinking water \nto rural Alaska and along with my colleague, Senator Stevens, we want \nto see the elimination of the honey bucket in rural Alaska. That is a \ngoal. And as the country moves toward the 21st century, Alaska's rural \nresidents should not have to live in these conditions, again often \ncompared to Third World countries.\n  I wish to especially acknowledge Carol Spils of my staff who has been \nworking with the Environment and Public Works Committee for a long time \non this legislation.\n  I would ask that the amendment be considered at this time by the \ncommittee. If there are additional details to be worked out, I would be \nhappy to pursue them currently or if the floor managers are satisfied \nwith them, why, I would ask they be included in the package. I would \nsend up the amendment and modification, if it is appropriate.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, as I understand the modification, it is to \nset a time limit on the authorization, am I correct, to the year 2003, \nand thus be in conformity with the rest of the legislation? \n\n[[Page S 17731]]\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. The floor manager is correct. I thank my friend from \nRhode Island.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. That would be fine. If we could make that modification, \nand if the Senator would submit that, then that would be accepted. Then \nwe would proceed to accept his amendment.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3070\n\n     (Purpose: To authorize the Administrator of the Environmental \n  Protection Agency to make grants to the State of Alaska to improve \n                sanitation in rural and Native villages)\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Then, Mr. President, I would send the modification to \nthe desk and ask for its consideration at this time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Ashcroft). The clerk will report the \namendment.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Alaska [Mr. Murkowski] for himself, Mr. \n     Chafee, Mr. Kempthorne, Mr. Baucus, and Mr. Reid, proposes an \n     amendment numbered 3070:\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 195, after line 20, insert the following:\n       ``(g) Grant To Alaska To Improve Sanitation in Rural and \n     Native Villages.--\n       ``(1) In general.--The Administrator of the Environmental \n     Protection Agency may make grants to the State of Alaska for \n     the benefit of rural and Native villages in Alaska to pay the \n     Federal share of the cost of--\n       ``(A) the development and construction of water and \n     wastewater systems to improve the health and sanitation \n     conditions in the villages; and\n       ``(B) training, technical assistance, and educational \n     programs relating to the operation and management of \n     sanitation services in rural and Native villages.\n       ``(2) Federal share.--The Federal share of the cost of the \n     activities described in paragraph (1) shall be 50 percent.\n       ``(3) Administrative expenses.--The State of Alaska may use \n     an amount not to exceed 4 percent of any grant made available \n     under this subsection for administrative expenses necessary \n     to carry out the activities described in paragraph (1).\n       ``(4) Consultation with the state of alaska.--The \n     Administrator shall consult with the State of Alaska on a \n     method of prioritizing the allocation of grants under \n     paragraph (1) according to the needs of, and relative health \n     and sanitation conditions in, each eligible village.\n       ``(5) Authorization of appropriations.--There are \n     authorized to be appropriated such sums as are necessary for \n     each of the fiscal years 1996 through 2003 to carry out this \n     subsection.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate on the amendment?\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, as I understand it, this sets the time \nlimit of 2003?\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. That is my understanding and my intent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If there is no further debate, the question is \non agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 3070) was agreed to.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Let me take this opportunity to thank my colleagues \nfor their accommodation on this matter. It is very meaningful to \nAlaska. Rural Alaska will be extremely pleased to see this continued \nprogress.\n  I also wish to again thank Carol Spils.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Mr. President, I want to alert my colleagues to a \nprovision of this bill which we are negotiating which I think could be \nvery pernicious and go well beyond anything that has to do with safe \ndrinking water, would expand potentially the authority of EPA to \nevaluate and issue cost-benefit ratios which, in turn, could affect \nFederal actions, across the broad spectrum of Federal action.\n  I am referring to section 28, beginning on page 179 of the bill. \nUnder this provision, the Administrator of the EPA can select major \nFederal actions, and we know that a major Federal action can be \nanything from drilling in ANWR, building a highway, having a timber \nsale, granting a loan--most anything. The Administrator of EPA would \ndetermine what he thinks would have a significant impact upon the \nenvironment and then would do a benefit-cost ratio on that major \nFederal action.\n  It tells him how to consider the benefits, and under section 6 on \npage 185, he is told to ``estimate the monetary value, and such other \nvalues as the Administrator determines to be appropriate, of the \nbenefits associated with reducing risk'', for example, of ``(C) \npreserving biological diversity,'' ``(D) maintaining aesthetically \npleasing environment,'' and other things with respect to regulating the \nchemistry of the air, so that, under this provision, the Administrator \nof the EPA has the specific authority to come up with a rating and a \nbenefit-cost ratio to deal with, for example, a timber sale regarding \nthe spotted owl.\n  So that the Administrator of the EPA, who is now not in the loop on \ndetermining a lot of these things, before you know it, there would be a \nbenefit-cost ratio that would say this timber sale or this drilling in \nANWR or the building of this highway or the granting of this loan has a \nbenefit-cost ratio of only 50 percent and does not pass anybody's \nmuster in terms of benefit-cost ratio.\n  There is no requirement of peer review. There is no requirement of \nmaking a rulemaking where the interested parties would be brought in. \nThere is just simply a broad mandate to the Administrator of EPA to go \nlook around at any place in the Federal Government where there is a \nmajor Federal action that may affect pollution--``pollution'' being \nbroadly defined--in which the Administrator of EPA can then take into \nconsideration everything from aesthetics to biodiversity. Mr. \nPresident, this could be a very, very bad provision.\n  The intent of the provision, of course, is good. The intent of the \nprovision is to rank various sources of pollution, to look at the \nrelative risks of different sources of pollution. Everyone agrees with \nthat. But the grant of authority under section 28 under this bill is so \nbroad that many Federal Departments will wake up one day and find out \nsomething that they had been working on for a long time, let us say the \nbuilding of a highway, suddenly becomes not feasible because EPA has \ndetermined that it had a benefit-cost ratio of only 50 percent and, \ntherefore, should not be built.\n  I suppose the determination that EPA made could be the basis of \ndeclaring a regulation or major Federal action to be arbitrary and \ncapricious. It could affect major Federal actions all across the board \nincluding, presumably, the Department of Defense, Department of the \nInterior, Department of Energy. You name it, the Administrator of EPA \ncould make that determination that it does not pass benefit-cost ratio.\n  Again, as the author of the original bill on risk assessment in the \nlast Congress, I very strongly support the idea of relative risk and \nrisk assessment, but I believe in an attempt to deal with this issue. \nThis bill imperfectly does it, and I hope before this bill is finished \nthat we can strike these provisions.\n  S. 343, the regulatory reform bill, deals with this issue, I believe, \nin a better way, because with respect to benefit-cost ratios, S. 343 \nprovides for a rulemaking and peer review, a rulemaking in which all \ninterested parties would be involved, a rulemaking in which the agency \nitself, which is putting out the regulation, would have the \nresponsibility of running the rulemaking.\n  Under this, EPA does not have to peer review, does not have to give \nnotice to interested parties. They can simply select around throughout \nthe Federal establishment any Federal action which they wish to deal \nwith and declare it to be not passing the cost-benefit analysis, \nbecause it fails to preserve biodiversity or fails to ``maintain an \naesthetically pleasing environment.''\n  That is what it says, Mr. President. It may not be the intent. It may \nbe correctable. I hope it is. But I believe section 28 ought to be \nstricken.\n  Mr. CHAFEE addressed the Chair. \n\n[[Page S 17732]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I want to thank the distinguished Senator \nfrom Louisiana for his thoughts on this. What we are doing now is \nseeking out and we are going to discuss this with the principal \nproponent of section 28. It is possible that we can do what the Senator \nfrom Louisiana suggests.\n  The Senator from Louisiana has some proposals that, in effect, deal \nwith regulatory reform in section 5, as I understand it. My question \nis, would he be prepared to drop those provisions?\n  As I understand, he has another amendment that deals with section 5. \nWhat I would like to do is, frankly, get all references to regulatory \nreform out of this bill. We could discuss it now, or we could meet and \nhave a quorum call. I know the Senator from Texas has comments on \nanother subject. But I would like to discuss with the Senator from \nLouisiana what I previously suggested, namely dropping the section 5 \nproposals he has suggested.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Mr. President, the section 5 is a slightly different \nsubject matter. I would certainly be very interested in talking to the \nSenator about that. I do believe section 28 ought to be dropped in its \nentirety. The problem is, if we do not drop it in its entirety, that \nwill engender amendments to put in the reg reform S. 343 provisions, \nand that is going to engender a huge debate. It seems to me that that \ndebate ought to be put off until another day and not be engrafted upon \nthe Safe Drinking Water Act.\n  The risk assessment on section 5 does have to do with safe drinking \nwater because it determines how you do risk assessment with respect to \ndrinking water. Section 28 really does not deal with safe drinking \nwater at all. That is why I think section 28 ought to be dealt with \nseparately. We would be prepared to discuss section 5 at any time the \nSenator wishes to.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, what I suggest is that we have those \ndiscussions now. I know the Senator from Texas is ready to go. There is \na gap here, and I do not know how long the Senator would like.\n  Mr. GRAMM addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, whenever I can serve the good of the Senate \nby speaking on another subject so that the discussion can occur, I leap \nto the opportunity.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. I was going to suggest 20, 30 minutes.\n  Mr. GRAMM. I do not know that I will go that long, but I will suggest \nthe absence of a quorum when I finish.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. That will be fine.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Will the Senator yield for a unanimous-consent request?\n  Mr. GRAMM. Yes.\n\n\n                         Privilege of the Floor\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Carl Mazza, a \nfellow with Senator Moynihan's office, be permitted to have floor \nprivileges during consideration of this bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/11/29/senate-section/article/S17700-6", "month": "11", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "29", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S17732-S17734]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        THE BUDGET NEGOTIATIONS\n\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, as we all know--in fact, as the whole \ncountry knows--intensive negotiations on the budget are underway in \nthis very building, and working Americans have a big stake in the \noutcome of those negotiations.\n  While we do not know the final makeup of the compromise that would \nemerge from these negotiations, what I have heard is already alarming. \nI want to talk about the things that we are reading about in the paper, \nthe apparent movement in the negotiations. I think it is important that \nif someone feels very strongly about a subject--and I feel very \nstrongly about this subject--that we not surprise them by waiting until \nthe last minute, when negotiations are finished and a final product has \nbeen produced, to suddenly spring it on people that are not going to \nsupport it.\n  So what I would like to do this afternoon is to talk very briefly \nabout the emerging budget deal and then talk about four simple \nprinciples that I intend to establish in terms of my own vote. \nObviously, I speak only on behalf of myself but I believe that, based \nupon the 1994 elections, the vast majority of Americans agree with the \nprinciples I will outline today. In fact, I think there is no doubt \nabout the fact that the vast majority of Americans agree with the \nprinciples that I will set forth, and which will guide my vote on any \nfinal budget agreement.\n  I think the general parameters of a negotiation are pretty clear in \nterms of what we hear from the White House, from Mr. Panetta, and what \nwe are beginning to hear from our own leadership. If you go back to the \nlast continuing resolution, there was a little line in that resolution \nthat, for the first time, opened the door to the possibility that we \nwould change the parameters, the assumptions in our budget.\n  Let me explain why that is so important. It sounds kind of trivial to \nmany people, what we assume about the health of the economy, interest \nrates, unemployment rates, and the number of people who qualify for \nGovernment programs. But let me explain how important those assumptions \nare. If you take the assumptions that the independent and nonpartisan \nCongressional Budget Office has established, which guide our budget, \nand you compare them to the assumptions contained in President \nClinton's budgets, his assumptions about lower unemployment, higher \ngrowth, lower interest rates, and less spending from existing programs \nultimately allows him to spend $1 trillion more, over the next 10 \nyears, than our budget allows us to spend.\n  Now, I have one constituent who can comprehend what $1 billion is--\nRoss Perot, but I do not have any constituents that I know of, who \nknows what $1 trillion is, so let me try to define it. The trillion \ndollars that President Clinton wants to spend over the next 10 years \nwould be equivalent to giving him the ability to write $15,000 worth of \nchecks on the checking account of every American family, over that 10-\nyear period. That is how much $1 trillion is.\n  I think it is clear that one path the negotiations could take, a path \nthat I am very concerned about, would be to change our assumptions. \nThis would be like a family assuming--when they sit down around the \nkitchen table at the end of the month, when they get out a pencil and a \npiece of paper and try to figure out how they are going to pay the rent \nor mortgage and how they are going to buy a new refrigerator before the \nold one goes, or how they are going to try to send the first child in \nthe history of their family to college, when they are making tough, \nreal-world decisions, when that we are not just making ends meet, but \nstruggling for the American dream--assuming that there will be more \nmoney to spend than will actually be available.\n  I want to be very sure, Mr. President, that we do not make, in \nwriting our new budget, an assumption that would be equivalent to a \nfamily saying, well, ``What if we won the lottery?'' or, ``What if we \ngot a big promotion next year?'' or, ``What if some distant relative we \ndo not know left us some money?'' We know American families do not do \nbudgets that way because they have to live with the consequences of \nthese decisions.\n  I am very concerned that we are on a path toward changing the \nunderlying assumptions in the budget in such a way as to let President \nClinton spend an additional $100 to $150 billion more each year over \nthe next 7 years than we have set out in our budget. I am very \nconcerned that, if we do this, we are giving up the first real \nopportunity we have had in 25 years to balance the Federal budget.\n  I want to let my colleagues know--and I know every person is trying \nto come up with the best solution to the impasse we have--but I want my \ncolleagues to know that under no circumstances am I going to support \nany budget that allows President Clinton to spend money we do not have \non programs we cannot afford.\n  If there was one promise that we made clear last year in the \nelections, it was that if the American people gave us a Republican \nmajority in both Houses of Congress, we were going to balance the \nbudget. I will have no part in backing away from that commitment.\n  The first principle I want to set out is a very simple one: I will \nnot support a budget that spends one dime more than the dollar figures \nwe set out in our balanced budget. We have written a budget and it was \nconsistent with putting the Federal deficit in balance over \n\n[[Page S 17733]]\na 7-year period. Families and businesses have to do it every year. It \nis not cruel and unusual punishment to make the Government do it over a \n7-year period. But we have written a budget that establishes the \nmaximum amount we can spend each year for the next 7 years and still \nbalance the budget. That amount, by the way, is $12 trillion. This is a \n27-percent increase over what we spent in the last 7 years.\n  It seems to me that this is enough, especially when you stop and \nthink about the fact that last Sunday, Americans sat down with the \nSunday newspaper and with their scissors and cut 120 million coupons \nout of their Sunday newspapers, and then carried those coupons to the \ngrocery store and went to all the hassles to turn in the coupons as \nthey were paying their grocery bill just to save a few nickels, dimes, \nand quarters.\n\n  Have we lost our ability to be outraged about the fact that the \nGovernment does not make those sorts of decisions when we are now \ntaking $1 out of every $4 earned by every family of four in America? In \n1950 we were taking only $1 out of every $50.\n  I think, if we back away from our commitment to balance the Federal \nbudget, we are betraying everything we promised in 1994, and I refuse \nto be a part of that.\n  The first principle is that I will not support a budget that spends \none dime more than the dollar figures we set out in our budget. \nEspecially since this is the maximum amount we can spend while still \nbalancing the Federal budget.\n  The second principle is that I am not going to vote for a budget \nwhich provides tax cuts that are smaller than the tax cuts set out in \nthe Balanced Budget Act. I want to remind my colleagues that we are \ntalking about letting working families keep an amount that equals \nroughly 2 percent of the total amount of Federal spending.\n  We promised in the election a $500 tax credit per child. That means \nbeginning in January every family in America with two children would \nget to keep $1,000 more of what they earn to invest in their own \nchildren, their own family, their own future.\n  We have a fairly tight lid on it. The money is only going to working \nmoderate, middle, and upper middle-income families. I know many of our \nDemocratic colleagues are outraged that, if you do not pay taxes, you \ndo not get a tax cut. I am not outraged about this. I think it is time \nto start operating Government in a way that tries to help those people \nwho pull the wagon instead of solely being focused on the people who \nare riding in the wagon and, quite frankly, are being kept in the wagon \nby programs that deny them the ability to get out and become part of \nthe American experience.\n  So I am not going to negotiate away a very modest tax cut which we \ncommitted to, which we set out in terms of absolute dollars at $245 \nbillion over a 7-year period, roughly 2 percent of the level of \nspending of the Government, 70 percent of which goes to families, that \nbegins to allow people to save more of what they earn, to invest more \nin their own children, and that has some modest incentives for economic \ngrowth.\n  Now, what is negotiable? First of all, I think we should be ready to \nsit down with the President anywhere, at any time, and under any \ncircumstance, to negotiate how we spend the $12 trillion that is \nconsistent with balancing the Federal budget. I think we ought to be \ntotally willing to sit down with President Clinton and negotiate on \neach of those 7 years, how that $12 trillion is spent while still \nbalancing the Federal budget.\n  I want to draw a clear line of distinction between negotiating about \nhow to spend the amount of money that is consistent with balancing the \nbudget and negotiating about how we might change the budget itself to \nallow more spending that we can not afford and that clearly would deny \nus the ability, for the first time in a quarter of a century, to \nbalance the Federal budget.\n  I also believe we should be willing to sit down and hear the \nPresident out as to what the makeup of the tax cut should be. I do not \nbelieve we should compromise further on the size of the tax cut. I \noffered the original amendment in the Senate which would have cut \nGovernment spending further than our budget in order to adopt the \nContract With America tax cut as it was adopted in the House. That \namendment was rejected. We have already compromised in coming down from \nthe original Contract With America.\n  As my dear friend, Dick Armey, said about compromising on the tax \ncut, he ``already gave at the Senate.'' and I agree with this \nsentiment.\n  It is clear that there is a movement in the negotiations toward going \nback and assuming that things will be better in the future than we \nbelieved they would be 3 weeks ago, because in some sense many Members \nof Congress and the White House believe if they could just assume away \npart of the deficit problem, that they could jointly achieve their \nobjectives, that we could claim we have balanced the budget, that the \nPresident could spend more money, and that perhaps happiness might be \nfound on both ends of Pennsylvania Avenue.\n  Mr. President, I am not going to support that effort. I think that \nwould be a tragic mistake. How can we conclude that the economy is \ngoing to be brighter in the future, if at the same time we prevent \neconomic growth by giving smaller tax cuts, by having the Government \nspend more money, and by having larger deficits?\n  We would be assuming a rosy scenario and doing things that deny the \nability of that scenario to ever come true. I am not going to support \nthat effort.\n  Let me set down this fourth principle. Any changes that we make in \nwhat are called economic assumptions or technical assumptions--what we \nthink interest rates will be 6 years from now, how fast we think money \nis going to be spent out of a program--that every penny resulting from \nthose changes and assumptions ought to go to deficit reduction. By \napplying it to deficit reduction we can guarantee that it will be there \nif, in fact, things do not turn out to be as rosy as we would like them \nto be.\n  We would be doing what prudent families do. That is, budget on the \nassumption that you are not going to win the lottery, budget on the \nassumption that you are not going to get the big promotion. And if you \ndo get the promotion, if Aunt Sally does give you money, then you are \nin a very sound position to decide what to do with it. I believe if we \nconclude, as we say in the language art that is contained in the \ncontinuing resolution, if the Congressional Budget Office, in \nconsultation with the White House and outside groups, concludes that \nthere may be a brighter future than we thought 3 weeks ago when we \ndebated this issue, then every dollar of savings ought to go to balance \nthe budget in this century.\n  Only in Washington do we have a debate about whether to balance the \nbudget in 7 years or 10 years or even whether to do it at all. I have \nnever, ever, in any of the States that I have traveled in the last few \nyears heard, nor, has anybody come up to me and said ``Senator Gramm, I \nthink balancing the budget is a great idea. Why not do it later than \nyou plan?'' I have never had anybody say that to me. But almost every \nday--and as many of my colleagues know, I am meeting a lot of people \nall over the country--almost every day somebody comes up and says, \n``Why are you waiting 7 years? Why don't we do it sooner? Why don't we \ndo it now?''\n\n  So, I think it is prudent policy that, if we conclude that the \neconomy is going to have a brighter future--basically because we \nconclude it is going to have a brighter future based on wishful \nthinking--then let us apply every dollar of savings that comes from \nthese assumptions to deficit reduction. And if, in fact, it the economy \ndoes turn out to have a brighter future, the maybe we will balance the \nbudget within this century. But if it does not, if the original \nassumptions, the original conservative assumptions, were right, then we \nwill balance the budget in 7 years as we promised.\n  I hear, every day, our colleagues talking about expanding the ability \nof the President to spend. A member of the leadership recently, while \non television, suggested that maybe we could bring the tax cut down \nfrom $240 to $195 billion. I disagree. I think this is the time to \nstand on principle. We had an election. We have a mandate. It is not as \nif the American people were deceived. They knew what we promised to do. \nWe wrote a contract. I know \n\n[[Page S 17734]]\nmany Members of the Senate say they did not sign the contract, but \nAmerica signed the contract when they elected us and gave us a majority \nin both Houses of Congress.\n  I think these four principles I have outlined embody a reasonable and \na flexible approach to living up to what we promised we would do and \nyet being willing to work with the President in saying: These are our \npriorities as to how we spend the $12 trillion that can be spent over \nthe next 7 years while still balancing the Federal budget. What are \nyours? Government must learn to live within the constraint that, quite \nfrankly, families face every month when they sit down around the \nkitchen table and get out that pencil and piece of paper. Families do \nnot have the luxury of saying, ``Let us assume that something great is \ngoing to happen, let us spend additional money.'' They have to \nnegotiate how they are going to spend the income they have available. \nWe should be willing to negotiate with President Clinton on that basis. \nWe should hear the President out in terms of his priorities, but we \nhave a priority that was given as a mandate by the voters in 1994. That \nmandate and that priority is balance the Federal budget under \nreasonable and realistic assumptions.\n  Anybody can balance the budget if you let them make up the \nassumptions. Any family can live within its budget if they can make up \ntheir income. That is not the trick. The real challenge, however, that \nis faced every night by millions of families sitting around their \nkitchen tables--which, quite frankly, we do not face here in \nWashington, and have not faced for 25 years--is how do you do it based \non the amount of money you are realistically going to be able to spend? \nEvery day in America, families are making these tough decisions, and \nthey are having to say no to the things they want. They are having to \nsay no because we never say no. They are having to say no to their \nchildren because we will not say no to spending more and more money of \ntheir money.\n  I think the time has come for us to say no. I want to say no so \nfamilies and businesses can say yes again. I want less Government, and \nmore freedom. I want less Government, stronger families, more \nopportunity, and more freedom. I think the way we get there is to stand \nup for some very simple principles. We are committed to balancing the \nbudget under realistic assumptions. We have set out what we can spend \nand still achieve our objective. We will spend no more.\n  We promised the working people of this country a very small, very \nmodest, very targeted amount of tax relief. It in no way gets working \nAmericans back to where they were 20 years ago, but it is a step in the \nright direction. It is something we promised and I am not going to back \noff from it. We can negotiate over how to spend the money, but not how \nmuch to spend. And, finally, if in fact we conclude that the \nassumptions of the budget should be updated, that we should assume a \nmore optimistic future--and I think we can make one by balancing the \nbudget--but if we makes these assumptions, then every penny of savings \nthat comes from those new rosy assumptions should go to deficit \nreduction. None of it should be spent.\n  These are the principles I intend to fight for. They are principles I \nthink embody what I fought for in the 1994 election when we elected a \nRepublican majority. They were embodied in the Contract With America. \nAnd I think, quite frankly, if we want people to believe politicians \nmean anything when they say it, then there is one way to achieve this \nand that is to actually do what you said you would do. I believe that \nif we stick to these principles we would finally be living up to the \ncommitments that we made. I, for one, intend to do it.\n  I wanted to go on record today as to what my position is, because I \ndo not want anyone to feel that, while they were away negotiating with \nPresident Clinton, somehow it was not clear where I stood. And when \nthis final deal is reached, I do not want anyone to be surprised, if it \nviolates one of these very, simple and, I think, eminently reasonable, \nprinciples, if I do not vote for the deal--because I cannot vote for a \nbudget that does not live up to the deal we made first with the \nAmerican people in 1994.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Santorum).

Mr. President, in returning to the Safe Drinking \nWater Act Amendments of 1995, I would like to address a few points.\n  There has been quite a bit of discussion about the idea of these \nunfunded Federal mandates that we have had for years. And in fact the \nCongressional Budget Office pointed out that probably one of the most \nburdensome, onerous Federal regulations that has been imposed upon \nlocal and State government has been the Safe Drinking Water Act \nAmendments of 1986. The unfunded mandates format for 1995 that was \npassed earlier this year and signed into law this year by the \nPresident's signature does not go into effect until January 1, 1996 \nand, therefore, this legislation before us today, Senate bill 1316, \ndoes not come in under the requirements of the Unfunded Mandate Reform \nAct of 1995.\n  As the sponsor of that act which was signed into law, I was \ndetermined and absolutely dedicated that we are going to stop unfunded \nFederal mandates around here and, therefore, as this bill has been \ndeveloped over 9 months I continually stayed in touch with the \nCongressional Budget Office. And in fact, I then submitted Senate bill \n1316 to the Congressional Budget Office and asked them to please go \nthrough this legislation as though the unfunded mandates format were \ncurrently law, used all the same criteria, and the tough examination of \nthis legislation. They have done so.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the letter from the \nCongressional Budget Office be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                    U.S. Congress,\n\n\n                                  Congressional Budget Office,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, November 7, 1995.\n     Hon.

Bill title: Safe Drinking Water Act Amendments of 1995.\n\n[[Page S 17735]]\n\n       3. Bill status: As ordered reported by the Senate Committee \n     on Environment and Public Works on October 24, 1995.\n       4. Bill purpose: The bill would amend the Safe Drinking \n     Water Act (SDWA) to authorize the Environmental Protection \n     Agency (EPA) to make grants to states for capitalizing state \n     revolving loan funds (SRFs). These SRFs would finance the \n     construction of facilities for the treatment of drinking \n     water. The bill would authorize appropriations of $1 billion \n     annually over the 1996-2003 period for these capitalization \n     grants. In addition, major provisions of the bill would:\n       Amend the procedures that EPA uses to identify contaminants \n     for regulation under the SDWA;\n       Allow states to establish an alternative monitoring program \n     for contaminants in drinking water;\n       Allow operators of small drinking water systems to obtain \n     variances from drinking water standards under certain \n     conditions;\n       Direct EPA to define treatment technologies that are \n     feasible for small drinking water systems when the agency \n     issues new contaminant regulations;\n       Require states to ensure that public water systems have the \n     technical expertise and financial resources to implement the \n     SDWA;\n       Establish a standard for the amount of radon in drinking \n     water;\n       Authorize appropriations of $100 million annually for state \n     public water system supervision programs (PWSS), $40 million \n     annually for protecting underground drinking water sources, \n     $35 million annually for protecting drinking water wellhead \n     areas, and $35 million annually for assisting small \n     drinking water systems; and\n       Authorize a loan for capital improvements to the Washington \n     Aqueduct, which is operated by the U.S. Corps of Engineers to \n     provide drinking water to the District of Columbia and parts \n     of Northern Virginia.\n       5. Estimated cost to the Federal Government: Assuming \n     appropriation of the entire amounts authorized for \n     discretionary programs, enacting S. 1316 would lead to fiscal \n     year 1996 funding for safe drinking water programs about $1.2 \n     billion above the 1995 appropriation. CBO estimates that the \n     bill would authorize appropriations totaling nearly $7 \n     billion over the 1996-2000 period.\n       The authorization for most of EPA's safe drinking water \n     activities expired in 1991, but the program has been \n     continued through annual appropriations. In 1995 about $166 \n     million was appropriated to EPA for safe drinking work and \n     grants. In addition to this amount, $700 million was \n     appropriated in 1995 and $599 million was appropriated in \n     1994 for EPA capitalizing grants to safe drinking water state \n     revolving loan funds (SRFs). Spending of these SRF funds was \n     made contingent upon enactment of legislation authorizing \n     safe drinking water SRFs. Public Law 104-19 rescinded all but \n     $225 million of the SRF appropriations.\n       Enacting S. 1316 would have a small effect on revenues from \n     civil and criminal penalties and on resulting direct \n     spending. Finally, enacting the bill could increase direct \n     spending for the payments of judgments against the federal \n     government resulting from claims made by states under SDWA; \n     however, CBO cannot predict the number or amount of any such \n     judgments that would result from enacting the bill. The \n     estimated budgetary effects of S. 1316 are summarized in the \n     following table.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                                   1995    1996    1997    1998    1999    2000 \n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                       SPENDING SUBJECT TO APPROPRIATIONS                                       \n                                                                                                                \nSpending under current law:                                                                                     \n  Budget authority..............................................     166       0       0       0       0       0\n  Estimated outlays.............................................     161      66      17       0       0       0\nProposed changes:                                                                                               \n  Estimated authorization level.................................       0   1,371   1,386   1,388   1,389   1,391\n  Estimated outlays.............................................       0     257     649   1,045   1,262   1,360\nSpending under S. 1316:                                                                                         \n  Estimated authorization level.................................     166   1,371   1,386   1,388   1,389   1,391\n  Estimated outlays.............................................     161     323     666   1,045   1,262   1,360\n                                                                                                                \n                                     ADDITIONAL REVENUES AND DIRECT SPENDING                                    \n                                                                                                                \nRevenues:                                                                                                       \n  Estimated revenues............................................  ......

Basis of Estimate: Spending Subject to Appropriations.--\n     For purposes of this estimate, CBO assumes that the bill will \n     be enacted before 1996 appropriations for EPA are provided \n     and that all funds authorized by S. 1316 will be appropriated \n     for each year. Over the 1996-2003 period, the bill would \n     authorize appropriations totalling $10.6 billion, including \n     $8 billion for grants to safe drinking water state revolving \n     loan funds.\n       In addition to the bill's specified authorization amounts, \n     CBO has estimated that $60 million to $70 million a year \n     would be necessary to pay for activities authorized by the \n     bill without specific dollar authorizations. Estimated \n     costs for these activities are based on information \n     provided by EPA. Estimated outlays are based on historical \n     spending patterns of ongoing EPA drinking water programs \n     and its grant program for waste water treatment state \n     revolving loan funds.\n       CBO estimates that enacting the bill would require about \n     $55 million annually (at 1996 price levels) to pay for EPA's \n     general oversight and administrative costs for the safe \n     drinking water program. This amount would constitute an \n     increase of about $15 million above EPA's current program \n     costs, principally for administration of the new SRF program. \n     We estimate that no funds would be required for grants to \n     states for the source-water protection programs that would be \n     established under section 17 of the bill because states are \n     unlikely to implement the optional petition programs \n     described in the bill. CBO also estimates a cost of at least \n     $5 million annually over the 1996-2000 period for EPA to \n     prepare the reports on environmental priorities, costs, and \n     benefits that would be required by section 28 of the bill.\n       CBO believes that the proposed authority for modernizing \n     the Washington Aqueduct should be treated as authority for \n     providing a federal loan to the three localities that receive \n     water from the aqueduct. In effect, the localities are \n     borrowing money from the Treasury to pay for modernizing the \n     aqueduct. Such a loan would be subject to credit reform \n     provisions of the Budget Enforcement Act of 1990. We estimate \n     that this authorization would have no net cost to the federal \n     government because the bill would allow the Secretary of the \n     Treasury to impose loan terms and conditions on the \n     localities involved sufficient to offset any subsidy cost of \n     the loan.\n       The Army Corps of Engineers estimates that the aqueduct \n     modernization project would cost about $275 million in 1995 \n     dollars and would take seven years to complete. Credit reform \n     requires that the subsidy cost of any loan--estimated as a \n     net present value--be recorded as an outlay in the year that \n     the loan is disbursed. But since the bill would require that \n     the three localities pay interest and any additional amounts \n     necessary to offset the risk of default, the subsidy cost of \n     this loan would be zero. Hence, we estimate that the proposed \n     loan would have no effect on outlays.\n       Revenues and Direct Spending.--Enactment of this bill would \n     increase governmental receipts from civil and criminal \n     penalties, as well as direct spending from the Crime Victims \n     Fund, but CBO expects that the amounts involved would be \n     insignificant. Any additional amounts deposited into the \n     Crime Victims Fund would be spent in the following year.\n       In addition, section 22 of the bill would explicitly waive \n     any federal immunity from administrative orders or civil or \n     administrative fines or penalties assessed under SDWA, and \n     would clarify that federal facilities are subject to \n     reasonable service charges assessed in connection with a \n     federal or state program. This provision of SDWA may \n     encourage states to seek to impose fines and penalties on \n     the federal government under SDWA. If federal agencies \n     contest these fines and penalties, it is possible that \n     payments would have to be made from the government's \n     Claims and Judgments Fund, if not otherwise provided from \n     appropriated funds. The Claims and Judgments Fund is a \n     permanent, open-ended appropriation, and any amounts paid \n     from it would be considered direct spending. CBO cannot \n     predict the number of the dollar amount of judgments \n     against the government that could result from enactment of \n     this bill. Further, we cannot determine whether those \n     judgments would be paid from the Claims and Judgments Fund \n     or from appropriated funds.\n       7. Pay-as-you-go considerations: Section 252 of the \n     Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985 \n     sets up pay-as-you-go procedures for legislation affecting \n     direct spending or receipts through 1998. Enacting S. 1316 \n     would increase governmental receipts from civil and criminal \n     penalties, and the spending of such penalties; hence, pay-as-\n     you-go provisions would apply. The following table summarizes \n     CBO's estimate of the bill's pay-as-you-go effects.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                            1996       1997       1998  \n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nChange in outlays......................          0          0          0\nChange in receipts.....................          0          0          0\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n       8. Estimated cost to State and local governments: S. 1316 \n     would change the process for setting standards for drinking \n     water contaminants, alter requirements for monitoring and \n     treatment, and create state revolving loan funds to provide \n     low-cost financing for public water systems.\n       The primary impact of the bill on state and local \n     governments would be to reduce the likely costs of complying \n     with future drinking water regulations. These future \n     regulations would impose significant costs, primarily on \n     local public water systems. The number of severity of these \n     regulations is likely to be less under S. 1316. However, \n     because these regulations are not yet in place, we cannot \n     estimate the magnitude of any savings at this time.\n       For example, the bill would change the level at which \n     future standards would be set for drinking water \n     contaminants. By allowing EPA to consider the cost of \n     compliance and the extent of the reduction in risks to health \n     when establishing new standards, the bill would allow less \n     stringent standards to be set in some circumstances and \n     would therefore lower the cost of compliance for local \n     water systems. Again, because these regulations are not \n     yet in place, we cannot estimate the magnitude of any \n     savings, although we expect that they would be \n     significant. \n\n[[Page S 17736]]\n\n       The bill also would create some new responsibilities \n     (mostly for states), but CBO expects that the cost of these \n     new responsibilities would likely be far less than the \n     potential savings realized from changing the current \n     standard-setting process and altering current monitoring and \n     treatment requirements. Furthermore, the bill extends the \n     authorization of certain existing appropriations and \n     authorizes the appropriation of additional federal funds to \n     help state and local governments meet compliance costs. In \n     total, the bill would authorize over $9.9 billion in funding \n     for state and local governments over fiscal years 1996 to \n     2003 and would make available for spending about $225 million \n     that was previously appropriated in fiscal years 1994 and \n     1995. Assuming the appropriation of these funds, CBO \n     estimates that the bill would likely result in significant \n     net savings to state and local governments.\n\n\n               Changes Likely to Reduce Compliance Costs\n\n     Standard-setting\n       The bill would change the procedures for determining \n     permissible levels of contaminants in drinking water in ways \n     that would likely lower compliance costs for public water \n     systems. First, it would rescind the requirement that the EPA \n     Administrator issue rules for 25 drinking water contaminants \n     every three years. No specific number of contaminants would \n     have to be regulated. Although it is possible that with this \n     change EPA would regulate more contaminants than current law \n     dictates, CBO expects that the agency would regulate fewer \n     contaminants than currently required.\n       Second, the bill would allow EPA to set the maximum \n     contaminant level goal (MCLC) for contaminants known or \n     likely to be carcinogens at a level other than zero in some \n     circumstances. MCLGs are concentration levels below which \n     there is thought to be no adverse effect on human health. \n     Under current law, the maximum contaminant level (MCL) is an \n     enforceable standard that is set as close to the MCLG as EPA \n     determines is feasible. Current law requires MCLGs for known \n     or likely carcinogens to be set at zero.\n       Third, the bill would give EPA the authority to set MCLs at \n     a level other than the feasible level if using the feasible \n     level would increase the health risks from other \n     contaminants. If EPA uses this authority, it must set the MCL \n     at a level that minimizes the overall health risk. Current \n     law does not allow EPA to consider the effect of new \n     regulations on the concentration of contaminants that are \n     already regulated.\n       Fourth, the bill would require that EPA conduct a cost-\n     benefit analysis for national primary drinking water \n     regulations before they are proposed. The bill also would \n     require EPA, when proposing a maximum contaminant level, to \n     publish a determination as to whether the benefits of the \n     proposed MCL justify the costs of complying with it. EPA \n     would be given the discretionary authority to establish less \n     stringent standards when it determines that the benefits of \n     an MCL set at the feasible level would not justify the cost \n     of compliance or when it determines that the contaminant \n     occurs almost exclusively in small systems. If EPA uses this \n     discretionary authority, it would have to set the MCL at a \n     level that maximizes health risk reduction at a cost \n     justified by the benefits. While current law requires EPA to \n     perform cost/benefit analyses of new regulations, it does not \n     give the agency the discretion to use those analyses as \n     justification for changing the standards contained in new \n     regulations. These last three changes in current law would \n     give EPA greater discretion to set less stringent standards \n     in future regulations. Any use of that discretion would lower \n     the cost of compliance for public water systems.\n       Finally, the bill would establish an MCL for radon and \n     would set specific requirements for regulations governing \n     arsenic and sulfates in drinking water. The impact of these \n     provisions on state and local government budgets is difficult \n     to gauge, since EPA has not yet written final regulations for \n     these contaminants. The bill would require the EPA \n     Administrator to issue an MCL for radon of 3,000 picocuries \n     per liter of water (pCi/Lwater). The impact of this change is \n     difficult to assess because the MCL for radon under current \n     law has not yet been determined. EPA has issued a draft MCL \n     of 300 pCi/Lwater, and agency officials estimate that public \n     drinking water systems serving 17 million people would be \n     required to treat water for radon at that level. Under the \n     higher MCL in the bill, systems serving fewer than 1 million \n     people would have to treat for radon. Without a clear \n     indication of the MCLs EPA would establish for other \n     substances under current law, CBO has no sound basis for \n     estimating the possible savings that would result from these \n     provisions.\n     Monitoring\n       Section 19 would change monitoring requirements for local \n     water systems in ways that probably would lower compliance \n     costs. First, it would allow the EPA Administrator to waive \n     monitoring requirements for states under certain conditions. \n     Second, it would allow states with primary enforcement \n     responsibility to establish alternative monitoring \n     requirements for some national drinking water regulations. \n     Alternative requirements could apply to all or just some \n     public water systems in the state. Third, this section would \n     give states with primary enforcement responsibility separate \n     authority to establish alternate monitoring requirements \n     specifically for small systems. Fourth, under \n     ``representative monitoring plans'' developed by the states, \n     small and medium water systems would probably monitor for \n     unregulated contaminants less frequently than they would \n     under current law. Finally, this section would direct the EPA \n     Administration to pay the reasonable costs of testing and \n     analysis that small systems incur by carrying out the \n     representative monitoring plans.\n     Compliance period, exemptions, and variances\n       Section 11 would change the date that primary drinking \n     water regulations become effective from eighteen months to \n     three years after the date of promulgation, unless the EPA \n     Administrator determines that an earlier date is practicable. \n     This change would give water systems more time to install new \n     equipment or take other steps necessary to come into \n     compliance with the new regulation.\n       Section 13 would ease the conditions under which a state \n     with primary enforcement responsibility may grant exemptions \n     from primary drinking water regulations. Exemptions are \n     currently given to water systems that, because of \n     ``compelling factors,'' cannot comply with national drinking \n     water regulations. These exemptions must be accompanied by a \n     schedule that indicates when the system will come into \n     compliance with the regulation. This section would \n     specifically provide that a system serving a disadvantaged \n     community may be eligible for an exemption.\n       Section 14 of the bill would set out conditions under which \n     small systems could be granted variances from complying with \n     primary drinking water regulations. Variances are currently \n     given to water systems that, because of the quality of their \n     raw water sources, cannot comply with regulations, even after \n     applying the best technology or treatment technique. This \n     section would broaden the qualifying criteria for small water \n     systems, increasing the likelihood that they would be granted \n     variances.\n\n\n               new requirements that would increase costs\n\n     Conditions of primary\n       Several sections of the bill would increase the \n     responsibilities of states only if they choose to accept \n     primary enforcement responsibility for national drinking \n     water regulations. Every state except Wyoming currently has \n     primary enforcement authority. Specifically, primacy states \n     would have to set up new procedures to review applications \n     for variances submitted by small systems and ensure that \n     systems remain eligible for any variances granted. They would \n     also have to establish requirements for the training and \n     certification of operators of public water systems. Beginning \n     in fiscal year 1997, they would have to prepare an annual \n     report for EPA on violations of national primary drinking \n     water regulations committed by their public water systems. \n     Primacy states would also have to consider and act upon \n     consolidation proposals from public water systems.\n       These new requirements would entail some costs for primacy \n     states. Based on information from state drinking water \n     officials, CBO believes that if all funds authorized are \n     subsequently appropriated, states would probably receive \n     enough money to pay for these additional requirements.\n     Procedures for small systems\n       Some provisions of this bill would require all states, \n     whether or not they have accepted primary enforcement \n     responsibility, to institute new procedures that would \n     benefit some water systems. These requirements could impose \n     significant additional costs on the states themselves. For \n     example, section 19 of the bill would require each state to \n     develop a ``representative monitoring plan'' to assess the \n     occurrence of unregulated contaminants in small water \n     systems. Under these plans, only a representative sample of \n     small water systems in each state would be required to \n     monitor for unregulated contaminants. Current law requires \n     all systems to do such monitoring. While these plans could \n     reduce the cost of monitoring for most small systems, they \n     would require extra effort by the states. Based on \n     information from a number of state drinking water officials, \n     CBO believes that if all funds authorized are later \n     appropriated, the states would probably receive enough \n     funding to pay for any additional costs.\n       Section 15 of the bill would require each state to take \n     certain actions to ensure that public water systems in the \n     state develop the technical, managerial, and financial \n     capacity to comply with drinking water regulations. States \n     would have to prepare a ``capacity development strategy'' for \n     small water systems as well as a list of systems that have \n     not complied with drinking water regulations. In some \n     circumstances, states would be allowed to spend money from \n     their annual SRF capitalization grant to pay for developing \n     and implementing their strategy.\n     Recordkeeping and notification\n       The bill includes other provisions that might lead to \n     additional recordkeeping and reporting responsibilities for \n     states and for public water systems. Section 4 would allow \n     the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency to \n     require states and localities to submit monitoring data and \n     other information necessary for developing studies, work \n     plans, or national primary drinking water regulations. This \n     section could increase reporting costs for state and local \n     governments, but on balance the bill would \n\n[[Page S 17737]]\n     likely result in a significant decrease in overall monitoring \n     requirements and costs.\n       Section 20 of the bill would substitute more specific \n     legislative requirements for current regulations governing \n     how water systems notify customers of violations of national \n     primary drinking water regulations. For example, this section \n     would add a new requirement that community water systems \n     notify customers of violations by mail. These requirements \n     might result in increased costs for local governments.\n     Definition of public water system\n       Section 24 would change the definition of ``public water \n     system'' to include systems that provide water for \n     residential use through ``other constructed conveyances.'' \n     This change would make drinking water regulations applicable \n     to some irrigation districts that currently supply water to \n     residential customers by means other than pipes. Districts \n     would not fall under the new definition if alternative water \n     is being provided for residential uses or if the water \n     provided for residential uses is being treated by the \n     provider, a pass-through entity, or the user. Those districts \n     that fall under the new definition could face increased costs \n     for treatment or for providing an alternative water supply.\n       CBO is still gathering information on the number of \n     districts that would be affected by this change; however, we \n     believe that because most of the water supplied by these \n     districts is for agricultural uses, the amount of water that \n     they would need to treat would be a small fraction of the \n     water they supply. Furthermore, the bill would allow \n     districts to make residential users of their water \n     responsible for treatment or for obtaining an alternative \n     water supply.\n\n\n                    authorizations of appropriations\n\n       The bill would authorize the appropriation of over $9.9 \n     billion for state and local governments over fiscal years \n     1996 to 2203. The largest authorization would be $8.0 billion \n     for the creation of state revolving loan funds (SRFs). In \n     addition, the bill would make available for spending $225 \n     million that was appropriated for the revolving funds in \n     fiscal years 1994 and 1995. If the authorized funds are \n     appropriated, these SRFs would be a significant new source of \n     low-cost infrastructure financing for many public water \n     supply systems. The bill would give states the flexibility to \n     transfer capitalization grant funds between the new safe \n     drinking water SRFs and the SRFs established by the Clean \n     Water Act for financing wastewater treatment facilities.\n       The bill would also extend the authorization for grants to \n     the states for public water system supervision (PWSS) \n     programs through fiscal year 2003 at $100 million per year \n     and in some situations would allow states to supplement their \n     PWSS grant by reserving an equal amount from their annual SRF \n     capitalization grant. The PWSS programs implement the Safe \n     Drinking Water Act at the state level through enforcement, \n     staff training, data management, sanitary surveys, and \n     certification of testing laboratories. The fiscal year 1995 \n     appropriation for PWSS grants totaled $70 million. Both EPA \n     and the Association of State Drinking Water Administrators \n     have found this level of funding to be inadequate to meet the \n     requirements of current law.\n       The bill would also allow the District of Columbia, \n     Arlington County, Virginia, and Falls Church, Virginia to \n     enter into agreements to pay the Army Corps of Engineers to \n     modernize the Washington Aqueduct. The Corps estimates that \n     the modernization would cost about $275 million in 1995 \n     dollars and would take around seven years to complete. The \n     terms of the agreements are subject to negotiation, but it is \n     likely that payment of principal and interest would begin \n     within two or three years and would be spread out over thirty \n     years. The three localities would raise the necessary funds \n     by increasing the water rates paid by their customers. The \n     localities' respective shares of the costs would be roughly \n     as follows: District of Columbia (75 percent), Arlington \n     County (15 percent), and Falls Church (10 percent).\n       9. Estimate comparison: None.\n       10. Previous CBO estimate: None.\n       11. Estimate prepared by: Federal Cost Estimate: Kim Cawley \n     and Stephanie Weiner. State and Local Government Cost \n     Estimate: Pepper Santalucia.\n       12. Estimate approved by: Paul N. Van de Water, Assistant \n     Director for Budget Analysis.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, I can state, based on that letter from \nthe Congressional Budget Office, that there are no new unfunded Federal \nmandates, and, in fact, as they pointed out, we will significantly \nreduce the cost to the local and State governments based on the \nlegislation, S. 1316.\n  Again, I think it is important to note that while that act does not \ngo into effect until January 1, we are complying with it today. And \nthat is as it should be.\n  Another point I would like to make is the fact that I think our State \nand local officials have made it very clear that one of their most \nimportant responsibilities to their constituents is to assure their \nconstituents that their drinking water is safe and it is affordable. \nTherefore, on many, many occasions during the course of the crafting of \nthis legislation, a coalition representing the State and local \ngovernments, the different entities that provide the waters to \ndifferent customers were part of the discussions. I ask unanimous \nconsent to have printed in the Record a series of letters, letters from \nthe National Governors' Association, the National Association of \nCounties, the National Conference of State Legislators, National League \nof Cities, U.S. Conference of Mayors, and a variety of other \norganizations, pointing out their strong support for this legislation.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n         National Governors' Association, National Association of \n           Counties, National Conference of State Legislatures, \n           National League of Cities, U.S. Conference of Mayors,\n                                                 November 9, 1995.\n     Hon. Dirk Kempthorne,\n     U.S. Senate, Dirksen Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Kempthorne: As elected representatives of \n     state and local government, we are writing to express our \n     strong support for S. 1316, the Safe Drinking Water Act \n     Amendments of 1995, as it was reported by the Committee on \n     Environment and Public Works. We ask for your help in passing \n     this legislation into law without extraneous or substantive \n     amendments. As you know, EPA has indicated that the drinking \n     water law is broken and that reform of the statute is a top \n     priority. Collectively our organizations agree that reform of \n     this program is of critical importance, and we have made such \n     reform our highest collective priority for this year. In many \n     respects, the current law is unfocused, arbitrary, and \n     imposes unacceptable costs on our citizens without \n     appreciable benefits. S. 1316 makes important improvements in \n     the law and deserves your support.\n       As a bottom line, S. 1316 makes the drinking water program \n     more effective in protecting public health. In her September \n     27 letter to Senator Baucus, EPA Administrator Browner \n     outlined her views on what a new drinking water law should \n     do. We believe S. 1316 satisfies those concerns. In \n     particular, this bill:\n       Helps prevent contamination of drinking water supplies by \n     creating the first framework for water suppliers to work in \n     partnership with those whose activities affect water \n     supplies.\n       Provides assistance to help build the financial, \n     managerial, and technical capacity of drinking water systems.\n       Assures that drinking water standards address the highest \n     risks by directing EPA to set priorities and to establish \n     standards for contaminants that occur in drinking water.\n       Allows EPA to consider both costs and benefits in \n     developing new drinking water regulations, as EPA has \n     recommended.\n       Provides much needed funds to help communities improve \n     drinking water facilities.\n       Finally, but not least important, the bill addresses the \n     problems of many of our smaller communities by requiring EPA \n     to identify appropriate health-protective technologies for \n     small water systems.\n       The bill represents countless hours of negotiation and \n     compromise among the various interests, including EPA. While \n     no party gets all that they want from such a process, the \n     final product is balanced and reasonable.\n       We are concerned about two amendments that may be offered \n     on the floor. One would require all water systems to report \n     on contaminants found in the water at levels that do not \n     violate the federal standards. The bill as drafted and \n     current law require reporting and public notification when a \n     standard is breached. In addition, water systems will be \n     required to report on monitoring for unregulated contaminants \n     in order to provide EPA with data on occurrence. States \n     already have authority to require additional reporting, and \n     some do. We support those provisions. However, additional \n     mandatory reporting would be burdensome and serve no good \n     purpose, and we cannot support them.\n       A second amendment may be offered allowing EPA to avoid \n     analysis and public comment requirements when EPA declares an \n     urgent threat to public health. The bill as drafted, combined \n     with provisions of existing law, allows EPA to react quickly \n     to protect the public in the event of an urgent threat. The \n     authorities for quick action include the emergency powers, \n     urgent threat to public health, and public notification \n     requirements of the current law and this bill. Faced with an \n     urgent threat, the Administrator can--and must--act quickly \n     to protect the public. Moreover, all Governors also have \n     authority to take emergency action to protect public health. \n     However, even the quickest action should not be blind with \n     respect to good science, the costs and benefits of that \n     action, or the effect of that action on other contaminants.\n       We have seen no evidence that the analysis required by S. \n     1316 would slow EPA's response to an urgent threat, while the \n     chance of mistakes dramatically increases when action is \n     taken in haste. The cost of such mistakes can be very high, \n     and could include costs of over-reaction, under-reaction, \n     addressing the wrong risk, or addressing a risk \n\n[[Page S 17738]]\n     in the wrong way. Those are the very mistakes that the analysis \n     required by the bill is designed to avoid. The EPA should not \n     take shortcuts even when quick action is needed, and the \n     public and the regulated community should have the right to \n     see EPA's analysis before standards are proposed.\n       We hope you understand how important this bill is to state \n     and local governments and to the citizens we represent, and \n     hope you will help move this bill to final passage.\n           Sincerely,\n     Governor Fife Symington,\n       Chair, Committee on Natural Resources.\n     Governor George V. Voinovich,\n       Lead Governor on Federalism.\n     Governor E. Benjamin Nelson,\n       Vice Chair, Committee on Natural Resources.\n     Douglas R. Bovin,\n       President, National Association of Counties.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                              Office of the Mayor,\n\n\n                                              City of Chicago,\n\n                                                 November 2, 1995.\n     Hon. Dirk Kempthorne,\n     Chairman, Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works, \n         Subcommittee on Drinking Water, Fisheries, and Wildlife, \n         Dirksen Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: I am writing to express my support of \n     your Safe Drinking Water Act reauthorization bill (S. 1316).\n       As you know, the City of Chicago like other local \n     governments, is plagued by unfunded federal mandates, many of \n     which stem from the Safe Drinking Water Act. Current law \n     makes blanket assumptions about the threats and conditions \n     facing municipalities and issues the same rules for every \n     city regardless of its unique circumstances. As a result, \n     Chicago has spent a significant amount of time and money to \n     comply with mandates that do not reflect the concerns of its \n     water system. These mandates are consuming resources that our \n     budget will not allow us to spend unwisely, and our citizens \n     should not be saddled with unnecessary increases in the price \n     they pay for safe drinking water.\n       In an effort to conserve our scarce resources, I have been \n     actively involved in the fight to reduce the burden of \n     unfunded federal mandates on local governments. The standard \n     setting process for safe drinking water is an issue that I \n     strongly believe needs improvement. I am pleased to see that \n     your bill addresses this issue by directing the EPA to set \n     drinking water priorities and to set standards for \n     contaminants that are present in our water. I also commend \n     you for recognizing the need for a cost-benefit analysis in \n     setting these drinking water standards.\n       Your bill will enable the City to use its resources more \n     efficiently and will allow the Water Department to take more \n     effective steps to guard against contamination that may pose \n     a real risk to the citizens of Chicago. For these reasons, I \n     thank you not only for your insight but also for your \n     leadership on this important piece of legislation.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 Richard M. Daley,\n     Mayor.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n\n                                 California Water Service Co.,\n\n                                   San Jose, CA, October 20, 1995.\n     Hon. Dianne Feinstein,\n     U.S. Senate, Senate Hart Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Feinstein: As you may know, on October 12, a \n     bipartisan group of Senators introduced S. 1316, the Safe \n     Drinking Water Act Amendments of 1995. I urge you to lend \n     your support to this important bill by signing on as \n     cosponsor.\n       S. 1316 adds needed flexibility to the Safe Drinking Water \n     Act (the Act) while preserving the Act's strong public health \n     protections. It improves the method for choosing and setting \n     drinking water standards; encourages states to prevent the \n     formation of--and consolidate--nonviable water systems (which \n     are responsible for the vast majority of water quality \n     violations); places greater emphasis on source water \n     protection; and directs EPA to place a priority on research \n     into cryptosporidium and at risk subpopulations.\n       These reforms are badly needed. Without them, Californians \n     face considerable incremental increases in their water bills \n     over the next few years without concomitant increase in \n     public health protections. For example, it would cost an \n     estimated $500 million for San Francisco to build a \n     filtration plant to treat one of the most pristine water \n     supplies in the world. California consumers would pay between \n     $3 and $4 billion in up front costs and about $600 million \n     annually to comply with the proposed radon regulation if \n     adopted unchanged. Yet merely by opening the window, they \n     will be exposed to higher levels of radon.\n       Nationwide, water utilities have spent billions of dollars \n     a year to ensure the safety of their customers' supply. Large \n     expenditures life these were made even before passage of the \n     Act in 1974 and will continue to be made with or without \n     changes to it. However, with the outlook for retail water \n     costs in California increasing, additional treatment costs \n     should not be imposed on our customers unless they are \n     necessary to enhance public health protections.\n       The California Water Service Company is the State's largest \n     investor-owned water utility serving 1.5 million people in 38 \n     communities around California. On their behalf, I appreciate \n     your interest in this issue.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  Donald L. Houck,\n     President.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n\n                                   St. Louis County Water Co.,\n\n                                  St. Louis, MO, October 24, 1995.\n     Attention: Tracy Henke.\n     Hon. Kit Bond,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Bond: Senator Kempthorne recently introduced \n     The Safe Drinking Water Act Amendments of 1995, (S. 1316), \n     which already has received bipartisan support from many of \n     your colleagues. Last week Gurnie Gunter of the Kansas City \n     Water Department provided testimony before the Senate \n     Committee on Environment and Public Works in support of this \n     legislation. I agree with Gurnie, as do most of the water \n     utility people I know.\n       This legislation represents significant improvement over \n     current law, would ensure increased protection of public \n     health, and clearly represents the consensus reached only \n     after long hours of deliberations. S. 1316 would target high \n     risk contaminants, require the use of better scientific \n     analysis, and target funds to much needed research. \n     Furthermore, the bill would repeal unnecessary monitoring \n     requirements and other wasteful SDWA provisions which drain \n     funds from real public health protection.\n       The bill has been endorsed by associations representing \n     state and local elected officials all across the country, and \n     contains many provisions which the EPA has been advocating in \n     a SDWA reauthorization.\n       For these reasons, I encourage you to cosponsor this \n     important reauthorization bill. I would also like to make my \n     staff available to your staff should clarification be needed \n     in the technical areas of the bill.\n       I appreciate your attention to this matter, and look \n     forward to hearing from you.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                     A. M. Tinkey,\n     President.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                                 October 24, 1995.\n     Hon. Dirk Kempthorne,\n     Chairman, Subcommittee on Drinking Water, Fisheries, and \n         Wildlife, Environment and Public Works Committee, U.S. \n         Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: The undersigned agricultural and \n     agribusiness organizations are pleased to comment on S. 1316, \n     the Safe Drinking Water Act Amendments of 1995, and in \n     particular Section 17, ``Source Water Quality Protection \n     Partnerships.'' The petition program in Section 17, which \n     Subcommittee Chairman Dirk Kempthorne took the lead in \n     crafting, successfully builds on a similar provision authored \n     in the last congress by Senators John Warner and Kent Conrad, \n     and adopted by the Senate. We certainly appreciate your \n     efforts to resolve agricultural concerns during development \n     of the Section 17 language. If implemented as envisioned, \n     this petition program contains the foundation for voluntary \n     partnerships involving state and local governments and \n     agriculture.\n       Importantly, the new petition program is not intended to \n     create new bureaucracies, a mini-Clean Water Act, or a new \n     layer of regulatory mandates imposed on farmers and other \n     stakeholders. Section 17 avoids a heavy-handed, ``top down'' \n     regulatory approach in which economic viability is ignored \n     and farmers could become victims. Instead, States have the \n     option of establishing a petition program. States may respond \n     to petitions where appropriate by facilitating locally \n     developed, voluntary partnerships through technical \n     assistance and financial incentives available under existing \n     water quality, farm bill and other programs, plus funds from \n     the new drinking water SRF as provided for in S. 1316. The \n     petition process is a common-sense, problem-solving approach \n     which offers farmers and other stakeholders the opportunity \n     to work with their local communities as partners.

Your \n     petition program will establish these voluntary partnerships \n     between state and local governments, helping agriculture \n     create a positive approach for solve water quality problems. \n     An important aspect of this program is that it does not \n     create new regulations or bureaucracies. Rather it provides a \n     means for a community or water supplier who is experiencing \n     water quality trouble to solve the problem with the help of \n     stakeholders using programs and resources that are currently \n     available under existing laws. This is a very practical \n     solution in addressing water quality needs.\n       We thank you and your staff again for your leadership and \n     responsiveness in addressing this issue.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                           Richard W.

As someone who is on the front line of this fight. I \n     want you to know how deeply your leadership and legislative \n     craftsmanship are appreciated. Put bluntly, in the current \n     political climate, it could not have been without you.\n       I am now confident that this Congress will enact amendments \n     that will protect both the taxpayer's wallets and the public \n     health.

Richard Shelby,\n     U.S. Senate, Hart Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Shelby. As you are aware, hearings were held \n     on Senate Bill 1316, reauthorization of the Safe Drinking \n     Water Act, on October 19, 1995.\n       Staff of the Department have reviewed this bill and \n     previously provided input through the National Governor's \n     Association and the Association of State Drinking Water \n     Administrators noting our satisfaction with the language as \n     presented. Lack of flexibility properly administer the Safe \n     Drinking Water Program has caused water systems in Alabama to \n     spend excessively on monitoring without an associated \n     increase in public health protection. The passage of \n     reauthorization will greatly benefit the water systems of \n     Alabama and not only provide a safer quality of drinking \n     water but a better environment for our citizens. I urge you \n     to co-sponsor this bill and provide support for its passage.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                    James W. Warr,\n     Acting Director.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                                Tulsa Metropolitan\n\n\n                                          Utilities Authority,\n\n                                      Tulsa, OK, November 1, 1995.\n     Hon. James M. Inhofe,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Inhofe: On behalf of the Tulsa Metropolitan \n     Utility Authority, I am writing to thank you for your \n     cosponsorship of S. 1316, the Safe Drinking Water Act \n     Amendments of 1995. We feel that S. 1316 is a significant \n     improvement over current law in that it increases the \n     likelihood that contaminants of real concern to the public \n     will be addressed. We feel S. 1316 will achieve this goal by \n     doing the following:\n       Using solid science as a standard setting basis;\n       Authorizing adequate funding for health effects research;\n       Securing the publics right to know;\n       Establishing a reasonable compliance time frame;\n       Ensuring that drinking water standards address the highest \n     priorities for risk reduction;\n       Setting up a framework and authorizing funds for source \n     water protection partnerships.\n       By supporting this bill, we recognize you are focusing your \n     attention as well as the state of Oklahoma's attention on \n     public health protection. Water quality is important to us \n     all; consequently, we feel that S. 1316 is a step in the \n     right direction to achieving better drinking water. We ask \n     that you continue your support of S. 1316 and the pursuit of \n     other supporters for the improvement of drinking water. We \n     truly believe S. 1316 will not only benefit the water quality \n     of Tulsa and the State of Oklahoma, but it will also benefit \n     the water quality of the entire country.\n       Thank you again for your support and continued pursuit of \n     this matter.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 Sandra Alexander,\n     Chairman.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                                Tulsa Metropolitan\n\n\n                                            Utility Authority,\n\n                                                 November 1, 1995.\n     Hon. Don Nickles,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Nickles: On behalf of the Tulsa Metropolitan \n     Utility Authority, I am writing to ask for your support of S. \n     1316, the Safe Drinking Water Act Amendments of 1995. By \n     supporting this bill, you would be focusing your attention as \n     well as the state of Oklahoma's attention on public health \n     protection. We here at the TMUA support S. 1316 and believe \n     it represents a significant improvement over current law by \n     increasing the likelihood that contaminants of real concern \n     to the public will be addressed. We believe it would do this \n     by achieving the following:\n       Ensuring that drinking water standards address the highest \n     priorities for risk reduction;\n       Utilizing solid science as a basis for standard setting;\n       Authorizing adequate funding for health effects research;\n       Securing the publics right-to-know;\n       Establishing a reasonable compliance timeframe;\n       Setting up a framework and authorizing funds for source \n     water protection partnerships.\n       Water quality is of utmost importance to us, and we feel \n     that the current bill up for approval by the Senate meets the \n     current water quality needs in an adequate manner. We would \n     greatly appreciate your support on S. 1316 and hope you will \n     continue to pursue what is best for Oklahoma.\n       Thank you for your consideration on this matter.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 Sandra Alexander,\n     Chairman.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                       Association of Metropolitan\n\n\n                                               Water Agencies,\n\n                                Washington, DC, November 15, 1995.\n     Hon. Dirk Kempthorne,\n     U.S. Senate, Dirksen Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Kempthorne: On behalf of the Association of \n     Metropolitan Water Agencies (AMWA), I would like to urge you \n     to support S. 1316, the Safe Drinking Water Act Amendments of \n     1995. The bill, which makes essential reforms to the nation's \n     drinking water law, was developed through a bipartisan effort \n     and has the backing of the major drinking water supply \n     organizations as well as State and local governments.\n       S. 1316 improves the current statute in several meaningful \n     ways. The bill establishes a rational approach to selecting \n     contaminants for future regulation, greatly improves the \n     scientific bases for establishing maximum contaminant levels, \n     and modifies the existing mechanism for setting standards by \n     providing EPA with the discretion to apply a benefit-cost \n     justification under certain circumstances. In addition, the \n     bill allows EPA to balance risks when considering the \n     development of standards and applies this risk balancing \n     authority to regulation of disinfectants, disinfection by-\n     products and microbial contaminants. The risk trade-off \n     authority is particularly important given the public health \n     and cost implications of controlling contaminants whose \n     treatment, by its very nature, may result in unintended \n     increased public health risks.\n       AMWA also urges you to support passage of S. 1316 without \n     significant amendments. The bill contains many compromises \n     that continues the Act's focus on public health protection \n     but also addresses many problems with the statute from a \n     variety of perspectives. Amendments that shift this balance \n     could serve to undermine the bill's support.\n\n[[Page S 17740]]\n\n       We urge you to support S. 1316.\n       Thank you for your consideration of this very important \n     matter.

John Kyl,\n     Russell Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Kyl: I am writing on behalf of Citizens \n     Utilities Company (``Citizens'') regarding proposed \n     legislation, Senator Kempthorne recently introduced the Safe \n     Drinking Water Act Amendments of 1995 (S. 1316) which already \n     has received bipartisan support from many of your colleagues. \n     Citizens strongly supports this reauthorization bill.\n       In the state of Arizona, Citizens provides water and \n     wastewater utility services to approximately 105,000 \n     customers in Maricopa, Mohave, and Santa Cruz Counties. We \n     are the largest contiguous investor-owned water/wastewater \n     utility company in the State of Arizona. Among our service \n     areas are the world-renowned, master-planned retirement \n     communities of Sun City, Sun City West, and Del Webb's newest \n     project, Sun City Grand.\n       This legislation represents significant improvement over \n     current law, would ensure increased protection of public \n     health, and clearly represents the consensus reached only \n     after long hours of deliberations. S. 1316 would target high \n     risk contaminants, require the use of better scientific \n     analysis, and target funds to much needed research. \n     Furthermore, the bill would repeal unnecessary monitoring \n     requirements and other wasteful SDWA provisions which drain \n     funds from real public health protection.\n       The bill has been endorsed by associations representing \n     state and local elected officials all across the country, and \n     it contains many provisions which the EPA has been advocating \n     in an SDWA reauthorization.\n       Thank you for your consideration of the foregoing \n     information. I look forward to hearing from you regarding \n     this important piece of legislation.\n           Very truly yours,\n                                              Fred L.

Carol Moseley-Braun,\n     U.S. Senate, Hart Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Moseley-Braun: I am writing to urge you to \n     cosponsor S. 1316, the Safe Drinking Water Act Amendments of \n     1995. The bipartisan bill was introduced by Senator \n     Kempthorne with 23 cosponsors including Senator Dole \n     (Majority Leader) and Senator Daschle (Minority Leader).\n       As the guardian of safe drinking water in Pekin, Peoria, \n     Alton, East St. Louis, Belleville, Granite City and Cairo, \n     Illinois-American Water Company believes S. 1316 is a major \n     step forward in the direction of better public health; safer \n     drinking water; and more responsive government. The reforms \n     contained in this bill represent a common sense solution that \n     supports both environmental protection and regulatory reform.\n       S. 1316 strengthens the scientific basis for establishing \n     drinking water standards; targets regulatory resources \n     towards greater public health risks and away from trivial \n     risks; establishes a stable, forward-looking framework for \n     addressing longer term drinking water issues; funds new \n     mandates while reducing existing mandates that don't work; \n     establishes a source water protection program; provides \n     authorization for a drinking water state revolving fund; and \n     provides for an improved federal-state partnership.\n       S. 1316 is supported by national organizations representing \n     governors, mayors, other state and local elected officials, \n     state drinking water regulators, and public water suppliers--\n     virtually all those responsible for assuring the safety of \n     America's drinking water.\n       It is important that we focus our resources on the overall \n     interest of the public and not simply react to political \n     rhetoric.\n       Thank you for your time and consideration. If we can \n     provide additional information for you please contact us.\n           Sincerely,\n     Ray Lee, President.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n\n                                     Bridgeport Hydraulic Co.,\n\n                                Bridgeport, CT., October 13, 1995.\n     Hon. Christopher J. Dodd,\n     U.S. Senate, Senate Russell Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Dodd: We understand that on October 12, 1995, \n     Senators Kempthorne and Chafee introduced S. 1316, ``The Safe \n     Drinking Water Act Amendments of 1995.'' This bill has bi-\n     partisan support from the leadership of both parties in the \n     Senate and has been endorsed by members of the Safe Drinking \n     Water Act Coalition, which represents state and local \n     governments and public water suppliers.\n       S. 1316 makes substantial improvements in the current law, \n     particularly how contaminants will be selected for regulation \n     and requiring a cost benefit analysis for risk assessment. We \n     believe when enacted, S. 1316 will help provide American \n     consumers with safe, high-quality water at a reasonable \n     price.\n       Since this bill will provide reasonable, risk reducing \n     water regulations, we urge you to become one of its co-\n     sponsors. Thanks for your consideration.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                            Larry L.

Dirk Kempthorne,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Kempthorne: On behalf of over 187 rural and \n     small communities in Idaho, we want to thank you for your \n     commitment to pass a revised Safe Drinking Water Act (SDWA).\n       The federal Safe Drinking Water Act has proven to be one of \n     the most expensive and most arbitrary federal mandates that \n     has been placed on rural communities. All water systems small \n     and large must follow the same ONE-SIZE-FITS-ALL federal \n     requirements regardless of the history and/or previously \n     tested quality of their water.\n       We urge you to pass the SDWA that corrects the over \n     regulation of small and rural communities. No one is more \n     concerned about ensuring public health protection than rural \n     communities with water systems, but specific changes need to \n     be made to make the law workable.\n       For a bill to benefit small and rural communities, the Safe \n     Drinking Water Act should:\n       1. Provide small communities with increased technical \n     assistance. This is what works in the field to help small \n     systems with the mandates. Small systems have the most \n     difficulty complying with the SDWA because of limited budgets \n     and big system requirements. Through the thick and thin of \n     the federal SDWA regulations, small and rural systems have \n     relied on their state rural technical assistance program to \n     help each other try to meet these ever increasing mandates. \n     This program needs to be strengthened.\n       2. No more federal regulation requirements. The revised law \n     should not include new requirements because EPA cannot even \n     manage the existing requirements. Viability, or the way a \n     system operates in order to meet standards, should not be \n     subject to federal regulatory definition. Our state can \n     manage its small systems. Rural consumers have to pay for all \n     the good ideas that come out of Washington. Giving the \n     federal bureaucracy authority over determining the criteria \n     for management and operations of local municipal water \n     systems will only increase burden on water operators and \n     local elected officials.\n       3. Urgent-Monitoring relief. We estimate that 20 to 25 \n     percent of Idaho's small communities did not utilize the 1993 \n     Chafee Lautenberg monitoring relief and therefore will have \n     to complete four samples of Phase II/V monitoring in 1995. \n     Please extend this one-test relief provision.\n       4.

I remember, Mr. President, on one occasion at a \nparticular meeting somebody who was part of the Federal establishment \nsaying, ``Well, if we do not have the Federal Government absolutely \nthrough regulation watch out for everything dealing with safe drinking \nwater, who in the world will?'' It is because of that same Federal \nmentality--somehow somebody thinks only the Federal Government can be \nthe guardian of the well-being of this country--I remind all of us we \nare the United States. We are not the Federal Government of America. \nThere are 50 sovereign States that comprise this Union, and those \nGovernors and those legislators and, within those States, those county \ncommissioners and those mayors, they care about their people. If you \nhad a situation in a community where there would be an outbreak of \nwater contamination that would be life threatening, those elected \nofficials would have a serious problem, not only the serious problem of \nimmediately dealing with the life-threatening situation but they also \nprobably would have a political problem because their constituents are \nnot going to allow someone to somehow jeopardize the safety of that \nwater which the children of that community are going to drink.\n  We have talked about cryptosporidium, the fact that it was not \nregulated in 1993 when there was an outbreak and 104 people died from \nthat particular outbreak, and yet today cryptosporidium is still not \nregulated. We are going to change that, and this legislation allows us \nto improve, therefore, public safety and public health, and we are \ngoing to do it at less cost. We are going to provide flexibility to \nStates and local communities, but we are going to then be able to \ntarget life-threatening contaminants such as cryptosporidium and go \nafter those contaminants instead of contaminants that pose absolutely \nno health risk and yet require these communities to spend their finite \ndollars on expensive monitoring systems. If this is not in keeping with \nwhat this Congress is trying to do, I do know what is.\n  So I am pleased that we do have S. 1316 before us. I am pleased that \nin the Environment and Public Works Committee all 16 members of that \ncommittee, bipartisan, support this legislation, as well as the fact \nthe leadership on both sides of the aisle, the majority leader and the \nDemocratic leader, supports this legislation. We are currently working \nwith some Senators who have proposals, amendments that they are \nsuggesting would improve this particular legislation. We will work with \nthem. I believe that we can resolve that. But again this is another \nsignificant step forward in our role as partners with State and local \ngovernments, working on behalf of the people of the United States of \nAmerica.\n  With that, Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Inhofe). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be \nallowed to proceed as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/11/29/senate-section/article/S17734-2", "month": "11", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "29", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S17741]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      ONE MARINE'S WILL TO SURVIVE\n\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, Lance Cpl. Zachary Mayo, from Osburn, \nID, population 2,000, is a marine aboard the U.S.S. America. In the \nearly morning hours of November 25, just a couple days ago, he was \nswept overboard from his assignment on the U.S.S. America. The Navy \nconducted 3 extensive days of searching, utilizing different ships and \nhelicopters to locate Lance Cpl. Mayo. His mother and father had been \nnotified that their son was missing at sea.\n  I just got off the phone with Mr. Stanley Mayo, the father, who \nreceived a call at 4 a.m. this morning that his son is OK. In fact, he \nspoke with his son. After 36 hours in the water, Zachary was picked up \nby a Pakistani fishing boat. He has been taken to Pakistan and is now \nin transit to the United States Embassy and will be returned shortly.\n  In speaking with his father and learning a little bit about what it \nmust have been like to be swept over and spend 36 hours without a \nflotation device, he described the survival technique utilized by this \ntough marine of utilizing the clothing and tying knots in both the \nsleeves of the uniform jacket, as well as the pants, and creating an \nair chamber. I think this, again, shows the quality of the people that \nwe have, and this is a testament to a young man's determination to \nsurvive--which he did, after 36 hours in I believe the Arabian Sea. \nAlso, it demonstrates the faith of a family that never gave up hope, \nand all in the Silver Valley were determined that they would receive \nthat good news.\n  Stanley Mayo told me moments ago that he went to bed last night with \nthe prayer that in the morning he would hear from his son, and that \nprayer was answered. So I know that all of us rejoice in what will be \nan outstanding reunion. Stan Mayo said that he cannot remember when he \never had such news that brought him such joy, except perhaps when it \nwas the birth of Zachary. So now to have the news that his son will be \nreturned is something we can all rejoice in.\n  Again, this is a testament to the ability of our U.S. military \npersonnel and their dedication to survival and carrying out their \nassignments. Again, I think it is something that we need to make note \nof. I say to the Mayo family, God bless all of them.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. COHEN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I want to commend Senator Kempthorne along \nwith Senators Chafee, Reid, and others, for their efforts to bring to \nthe floor this important safe drinking water legislation, which I was \npleased to cosponsor. The changes that would be made by this bill--\nreducing unnecessary burdens and costs to communities and ratepayers \nwhile guaranteeing reliable drinking water--have been sought by cities \nand towns in my State for many years now.\n  The Safe Drinking Water Act is perceived at the local level to be one \nof the most expensive and onerous Federal environmental requirements \nthat we have. Reform of drinking water regulations has been a top \npriority of local officials across the country as they expressed \nincreasing frustration with unfunded Federal mandates. As a former \nmayor, I understand the difficulties local officials encounter when \nthey are faced with an enormous number of requirements and little money \nto pay for them.\n  I was pleased to be an initial cosponsor of the Unfunded Mandates \nReform Act of 1995 which was the first step taken by Congress to reduce \nthe impact of unfunded mandates. That was enacted into law last March \nunder the leadership of Senator Kempthorne. It is going to make it much \nmore difficult to enact new unfunded mandates.\n  The second step toward reducing the burden on communities is to \ndirectly address the unfunded mandates that currently exist on the \nbooks. The bill before us today represents a very thoughtful and \nprudent approach to this critical second step.\n  The purpose of the bill is to maintain a safe drinking water supply \nwhile reducing the cost to communities and ratepayers. We need to \nremind ourselves that while cutting costs is very important, it is also \ncritical that we do not lose sight of the fundamental goal of providing \ncitizens with clean drinking water. People expect the water coming out \nof the tap to be safe, and we must not do anything that would \njeopardize public health.\n  It is a sorry comment indeed that you read in the local paper in this \ncommunity that people need to boil their drinking water. Here we are in \nthe Nation's Capital where people have to be alerted that the water \nthey are drinking is not safe, that it contains harmful bacteria. \nTherefore, local residents are told to be sure to boil their water. \nThat does not say very much for the state of affairs in this community, \nto say the least. But it is a warning, perhaps, to all of us that we \ncannot simply engage in looking at the costs without taking into \naccount what the major and central goal has to be: protecting the \nhealth and welfare of our people.\n  This bill would amend the Safe Drinking Water Act to increase the \nrole of risk assessment and cost-benefit analysis in standard setting. \nIt would also provide waivers from various requirements for small \ndrinking water systems, and would authorize a revolving loan fund to \nprovide funding for drinking water infrastructure projects. This \nlegislation goes a long way toward providing flexibility for States and \nmunicipalities to develop drinking water programs that make sense for \nparticular communities instead of the current one-size-fits-all \napproach.\n  One of the most critical aspects of this legislation is its \nrecognition of the unique problems expensive Safe Drinking Water Act \nrequirements pose to small communities. A recent CBO study found that \nthe Safe Drinking Water Act has resulted in fairly modest costs for a \nmajority of the households in this country. Approximately 80 percent of \nthe households are expected to incur costs of $20 annually. However, \nthe CBO noted that ``the household served by small water systems are \nparticularly likely to face high costs,'' some well in excess of $100 \nper year. Additionally, that study found that costs to ratepayers tend \nto be higher for surface water systems than for groundwater systems.\n  In Maine, the majority of households get their water from municipal \nsystems, all but a handful of which serve fewer than 10,000 users, and \nmost of which serve less than 4,000 users. Maine has a relatively high \npercentage of water systems that rely on surface water as their source. \nBecause this water has historically been very clean, few towns had \nfiltration facilities. As a result, Maine water systems now have spent \nover $150 million in the past few years to comply with the surface \nwater treatment rule, which has been particularly hard for these small \ncommunity systems.\n  One example of this would be Southport, ME. It is an island town of \nabout 650 year-round residents, where the voters recently rejected--\noverwhelmingly, I should point out--a $300,000 plan to bring the town \ninto compliance with the Safe Drinking Water Act. The town's 70-year-\nold system relies on surface water since there is little potable ground \nwater on the island. Providing water that meets the law's standards \nwould raise the annual water rates for seasonal residents from $136 to \n$306.\n  In Searsport, ME, the water district is currently proposing a 66-\npercent rate increase due to the need to convert from surface to ground \nwater. As a result, the water costs of one Searsport company would \nincrease by $48,000 a year. The company, understandably, is considering \nother water sources, although the implication for other users are going \nto be enormous if that company left the town system.\n  Finally, I would like to share just one more example of the need to \nreform the Safe Drinking Water Act. Among the many letters I have \nreceived from Mainers expressing concerning about the law's impact is a \nvery thoughtful letter from Mrs. Audrey Stone of Bucksport. Mrs. Stone \nwrote:\n\n       As I rely totally on my Social Security check and therefore \n     am restricted to a fixed income, as are many other residents \n     in this community, you can readily see that the impact of a \n     water rate increase in excess of $200 per year poses grave \n     threats to my ability to maintain my residence. Additionally, \n     those residents who have another source of water supply may \n     choose to shut off the water company at the street, returning \n     to their own source of water and defeating the purpose of \n     this previously enumerated act. Further, this leaves less \n     ratepayers to absorb the cost of the mandated improvements.\n\n  Mr. President, I strongly believe we have to preserve public \nconfidence in the safety of our drinking water, but current Federal \nlaws seek to achieve the goal of clean drinking water in a very \nexpensive and sometimes very wasteful manner.\n  This bill will maintain a safe drinking water supply and reduce \nunnecessary costs and burdens to communities and utilities that provide \nthe water. By reducing unnecessary costs and providing additional \nFederal funding, communities will be better able to maintain reasonable \nrates and address other public works concerns and priorities such as \nlaw enforcement and education.\n  Mr. President, there was a former city official from Lewiston, ME, \nwho said, as a result of the costs of water regulations to communities, \n``We will have the cleanest water in the State and the dumbest kids.''\n  It was a provocative statement, but it certainly hit home because he \nindicated that he was faced with a Hobson's choice of either obeying \nFederal environmental mandates or spending money on educating the \ncommunity's children. He could not do both.\n  I think this legislation will help solve that Hobson's choice and \nallow some flexibility to small communities so they may meet the goal \nof protecting our people while not forcing them to cut education and \nother high-priority items.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this important legislation. I yield \nthe floor.\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I rise today to support final passage of \nSenate bill 1316, the Safe Drinking Water Act Amendments of 1995. I am \nproud to be an original cosponsor of this important bill.\n  Montana is an extremely rural State. In fact, we don't have a \ndrinking water system that serves more than 100,000 people. Most of our \nwater systems don't serve more than 10,000 people. Meeting the \nrequirements under the \n\n[[Page S 17743]]\nexisting water laws has been difficult, at best, for many of these \ncommunities.\n  The bill we are considering today is a step in the right direction. \nIt will give relief to communities and improve public health \nregulations by reducing burdensome and unnecessary regulations.\n  Over the next 8 years, this bill authorizes $1 billion annually in \nFederal grants. These grants go directly to the States where loans or \ngrants can be made to local water systems. In addition, this bill \ncontains a provision where a percentage of the funds can be allocated \nfor disadvantaged communities. This bill also gives our Governors the \nflexibility to transfer funds between the clean water and drinking \nwater State revolving loan funds.\n  The bill provides $15 million for technical assistance for small \nsystems. This is a $5 million increase over existing levels. The \ntechnical assistance program often is the only contact systems have to \nmeet the requirements under the Safe Drinking Water Act. In addition, \nS. 1316 allows the technical assistance funding to be used for the \nrural water wellhead-groundwater protection program. This has been one \nof the most successful programs in rural communities. And prevention is \nless expensive than remediation.\n  Included in the current law, is a mandate to promulgate standards for \n25 additional contaminants every 3 years. S. 1316 repeals this mandate \nand sets a new mechanism to identify contaminants for future \nregulations.\n  The most expensive part of running a water system is the monitoring \nwhich must occur. S. 1316 moves the decision to the States regarding \nmonitoring. This will allow local conditions to be considered. Systems \nserving up to 10,000 people can skip repeat testing for many \ncontaminants that do not pose health risks if the first sample in a \nquarterly series does not detect the contaminant. This could reduce the \nmonitoring by 75 percent in some communities.\n  Most importantly, this bill contains no new Federal mandates. S. 1316 \ndoes not contain any new Federal regulatory program. Montanans want the \nFederal Government out of their lives, and this bill not only does not \nadd new regulations, it streamlines the requirements contained in the \ncurrent bill.\n  There is no constituency for dirty water. However, the problem with \nthe existing law is it is based on fines and penalties. The bill we \nwill pass today takes us away from that mentality. It gives the States \nand communities the tools to provide folks with safe water. It is a \nbill based on providing communities with assistance, not penalties.\n  I am pleased to be an original cosponsor of this bill and I look \nforward to it being enacted into law.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I am pleased to rise in support of the \nSafe Drinking Water Amendments Act of 1995. I want to commend Senators \nChafee, Kempthorne, Baucus, and Reid for their excellent work in \ncrafting a bipartisan bill.\n  This bipartisan effort is particularly important because \nenvironmental issues have been marked by such sharp and bitter \ncontroversy this Congress. Twenty-five years of bipartisan support for \nstrong environmental protection have been placed in jeopardy. I hope \nthat this bill will serve as a model for getting us back on track. The \nbill makes reasonable changes to the Safe Drinking Water Act but does \nnot roll back protection of human health.\n  The No. 1 responsibility Congress has, and what people demand from \nus, is to protect the people we serve from harm. That means guarding \nour national security with a strong defense, and keeping our streets \nsafe from crime. But that also means protecting people from drinking \npoisonous water, breathing dangerous air, and from eating contaminated \nfood--in other words, protecting people from harms from which they \ncannot protect themselves. We can and should reform our laws to make \nthem more cost-effective and to eliminate unnecessary requirements. But \nwe should not waiver from our responsibility to protect people.\n  One of the major reasons that the current Safe Drinking Water Act \nneeds adjustment is that many drinking water systems--mostly smaller \nsystems--have difficulty complying with the law because of lack of \nfunding and expertise. These systems also often lack trained operators. \nThe legislation addresses these issues by authorizing a State revolving \nfund of $1 billion per year through 2003 to upgrade facilities to \nenable systems to come into compliance with the current standards, and \nby requiring that States receiving SRF money must have a system of \noperator certification and a training program.\n  The issue of the use of cost-benefit analysis in setting standards \nfor protecting human health and the environment has been extremely \ncontroversial this Congress, particularly in the context of regulatory \nreform legislation. This bill demonstrates that the most effective way \nfor Congress to consider the use of cost-benefit analysis is in the \ncontext of individual statutes. In the abstract, in the context of a \nbroad regulatory reform bill covering every health, safety, and \nenvironmental law, cost-benefit analysis becomes highly contentious \nbecause we simply don't know the impact on all the laws we are \naffecting. But this legislation demonstrates that we can clearly reach \nagreement when we look at individual statutes.\n  This legislation allows the EPA Administrator discretion to utilize \ncost-benefit analysis to move away from technology-based standards in \nthose circumstances where benefits do not justify costs. But there are \nlogical limits restrictions on this authority that make sense in the \ncontext of the Safe Drinking Water Act. These restrictions include the \nfollowing. First, the discretion is solely with the Administrator to \nuse this authority. No court may compel the Administrator to use this \nauthority. Second, the Administrator cannot use this discretion when \nthe benefits justify the costs for large systems and variances from the \nstandards are available for small systems. Third, the Administrator \ncannot use this authority to make any existing standard less stringent. \nIn other words, there can be no rollback of human health protection. \nFourth, the authority may not be used for rules relating to \ncryptosporidium and disinfectants or disinfectant byproducts. Fifth, \nthere must be a full consideration of nonquantifiable benefits in any \nanalysis of whether benefits justify costs. Sixth, the health effects \non sensitive subpopulations must be considered in determining whether \nbenefits justify costs. Seventh, judicial review of the Administrator's \ndetermination of whether benefits justify costs can only occur as part \nof the final rule and can only be considered by the court under the \narbitrary and capricious standard.\n\n  Some concern has been expressed in the Litchfield County area of my \nState regarding levels of radon found in their drinking water, and the \nenvironmental community has raised concerns that the radon standard in \nthe bill is not strong enough. Unfortunately, since 1992, Congress as \npart of the appropriations process has prevented EPA from issuing a \nradon standard. The EPA spending bill this year, which I opposed, again \nincluded this restriction. Those who have led this effort cite the fact \nthat the EPA Science Advisory Board, in a report to Congress, raised \nserious concerns about EPA's approach to regulating radon.\n  This bill moves the process forward by establishing for the first \ntime a Federal standard for radon at a level which the managers of the \nbill indicate finds support in the EPA Science Advisory Board report. \nImportantly, however, the bill contains a specific provision allowing \nthe EPA Administrator to set a more stringent level for radon if \ncertain conditions are met; in addition, States have the authority to \nset more stringent standards. I am confident that the EPA Administrator \nwill take this authority very seriously, and I intend to follow up with \nthe Agency on its use of this authority.\n  Finally, the provisions relating to source-water protection are, in \nmy view, not strong enough. As we have found in Connecticut, protecting \nthe sources of drinking water makes good common sense--it's pollution \nprevention that will save water systems and communities money. I hope \nthese provisions can be strengthened in the House and conference.\n  Again, my congratulations to the managers.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, today the Senate has the opportunity to \ndemonstrate that the Federal Government is responsive to needs of the \nStates and localities as they seek to provide quality drinking water to \ntheir citizens. It \n\n[[Page S 17744]]\nis imperative that Congress move forward on a Safe Drinking Water Act \n[SDWA] that revises the standard setting process that bases drinking \nwater standards on an analysis of costs and public health benefits, \neliminates unnecessary monitoring requirements, and has regulations \nbased on the occurrence of a given contaminant and existence of public \nhealth risks instead of an arbitrary and escalating schedule of \ncontaminants.\n  Congress passed the Safe Drinking Water Act in 1974 following public \nconcern over findings of harmful chemicals in drinking water supplies. \nThe intentions were admirable, but today's SDWA is a law that is too \nrigid and fails to prioritize risks. The current law operates under the \nnotion that EPA bureaucrats are better able than local public health \nofficials to determine the public health needs of a local community. \nBecause of this, contaminants like cryptosporidium that ought to be \nregulated go unregulated because water operators are too busy expending \nlimited resources on testing for so many random and sometimes obscure \nsubstances. In addition, the law fails to acknowledge that today's \ndrinking water systems are capable of efficiently delivering 40 million \ngallons of safe water to American homes every day.\n  The current SDWA is also an excellent example of a statute where \nlitle or no science is required to regulate; there is no flexibility to \nset priorities based on risk to public health until 83 contaminants are \nregulated.\n  The 1986 amendments to the Safe Drinking Water Act required EPA to \nregulate a specific list of 83 contaminants, allowing the Agency seven \nsubstitutions. Regardless of the health risk associated with each of \nthe contaminants listed in the statute, EPA was told to regulate 9 \ncontaminants 1 year after enactment of the statute; 40 contaminants \nwithin 2 years of enactment; and the remainder 1 year later. Once EPA \ncompletes the list of 83, the statute goes on to require EPA to \nfinalize regulations for 25 new contaminants every 3 years regardless \nof whether the contaminants occur in drinking water, or whether they \nare of public health concern.\n  Nowhere in the statute does it say that the Agency should have good \nscience, or peer-reviewed science or that if there are contaminants in \ndrinking water supplies of greater health concern than those on the \nlist, that EPA should regulate them first.\n  EPA acknowledges that they have found it impossible to keep up with \nthe statute's requirements and recognizes that the requirement has \nresulted in some pretty poorly drafted rules. In fact, in EPA's 1993 \nreport to Congress, the Agency was quite frank about the statute's \nrequired deadlines and the quality of the data used. The Agency said in \nits report:\n\n       To meet these deadlines, data collection and analysis have \n     not always been as thorough as desired. Document drafting and \n     management review had to occur simultaneously and documents \n     have needed to be rewritten and rereviewed. Short review \n     periods have resulted in oversights and the need to publish \n     correction notices. Regulations covering multiple \n     contaminants have often been lengthy and complex. Thus, the \n     public had difficulty providing thoughtful comments and the \n     Agency had limited resources for gathering and analyzing \n     additional data in response to comments. In some cases, \n     unrealistic deadlines have contributed to the Agency's \n     difficulty in addressing the unique technical and economic \n     capacity problems of very small systems.\n\n  The current drinking water law, in other words, has played a large \nrole in creating the information vacuum that now exists on the \nregulation of cryptosporidium for instance.\n  One reason it has taken EPA so long to focus on cryptosporidium is \nthe current law. Its rigidity and lack of flexibility have created a \nsituation where even EPA's resources have gone to complying with a \nrequirement to regulate an arbitrary list of 83 contaminants, most of \nwhich according to EPA occur in drinking water seldom and rarely at \nlevels of public health concern, rather than concentrating efforts on \npriority contaminants. Even more wasteful is the significant amount of \nfunds being spent by local communities monitoring for contaminants that \ndo not occur in their particular source of water. Hundreds of millions \nof dollars a year are spent on monitoring for the contaminants \nregulated currently.\n  If we are not looking at what is occurring in the drinking water \nsupply and we are not required to have adequate or even good science to \nregulate, it is not surprising that we wind up regulating contaminants \nthat may not be of the highest concern--and those priority \ncontaminants, such as cryptosporidium, go unregulated.\n  Local water suppliers, however, have recognized the need to move \nahead without EPA regulations and have led the effort to develop a \nvoluntary partnership with the States and EPA to enhance existing \ntreatment processes to help safeguard drinking water from \ncryptosporidium in advance of the knowledge needed to develop an \nappropriate national regulation.\n  It is past time that the Federal Government get in step and develop \nreforms that allow for prioritization of standards based on risk to the \nhuman population.\n  It is past time to bring common sense to both laws and regulations.\n  I commend Senators Kempthorne, Reid, Chafee, and Baucus for working \ndiligently to get this broad, bipartisan supported legislation to the \nfloor. I will support this legislation because it goes a long way in \nimproving the current law. It eliminates the arbitrary schedule of \ncontaminants, provides much-needed assistance to small systems, \nrequires good, peer-reviewed science, changes standard setting \nrequirements, implements voluntary sourcewater protection initiatives, \nand many more things. It is imperative that these changes are made. \nHowever, I do have some concerns with the legislation and this is why I \nhave not cosponsored the bill.\n\n  I believe we need to do more to ensure that those responsible for \nproviding safe drinking water can adequately pursue the activities \ndeemed most important in protecting public health with the resources \navailable. We need to continue to address seriously the issues of risk \nassessment and cost-benefit analysis.\n  According to the National Academy of Public Administration, the NAPA \nreport:\n\n       The tools of risk analysis and economic analysis help \n     clarify regulatory and priority-setting issues confronting \n     EPA and Congress. The discipline of analyzing risks, costs, \n     and benefits encourages a degree of consistency in approach \n     to understanding problems and defining solutions. The tools \n     can and do provide information that is important for \n     decisionmakers to consider. Shelving any of these tools, as \n     some advocate, would be foolish and counterproductive, an \n     invitation to muddle through rather than to learn and think.\n\n  By setting risk based priorities we have the best opportunity to \nallocate, in the most cost-effective manner, the resources of the \nGovernment and private sector in protecting the public from \ncontaminants in drinking water. We need to do all we can to provide \ngreater protection to the public at less cost than the current system \nmandates.\n  Once again, the NAPA report urges that:\n\n       Congress should ask the agency to explain its significant \n     regulatory decisions in terms of reductions in risk, and in \n     terms of other benefits and costs. The agency should support \n     state and local efforts to engage the public in comparing \n     environmental risks, report periodically to Congress on a \n     national ranking of risks and risk-reduction opportunities, \n     and use comparative risk analysis to help set program and \n     budget priorities.\n\n  One of the reasons that I stress the issues of risk assessment and \ncost benefit as they relate to budget priorities is because that is the \nonly way we are going to get the ``biggest bang for the buck.'' My \ncolleagues on the committee have already heard my concerns regarding \nthe authorization for appropriations in this bill. I was hoping that my \nconcerns were going to be addressed, but I understand my colleagues on \nthe other side of the aisle have objected. Therefore, I am compelled to \nshare with everyone, once again, my views regarding this issue.\n  Every single one of us, Republican or Democrat, has a responsibility \nto balance the budget. We have seen over the last several weeks that \nour views might not be identical on how to achieve this objective, but \nthe objective is the same--a balanced budget.\n\n  As authorizers, not just on this committee, but all committees, we \nmust start to be more realistic in our funding expectations. Do not get \nme wrong, I know that as an authorizer I would probably authorize more \nthan I know would be appropriated--so as not to tie \n\n[[Page S 17745]]\nthe hands of the appropriators and just in case the slim chance would \nexist that full funding could be achieved. However, authorized pie-in-\nthe-sky numbers have contributed to our budget problems and in my \nopinion, when we know from the beginning that the proposed \nauthorization for appropriation is not possible we are being unfair to \nall our constituents.\n  Reality is that discretionary spending is declining. The EPA budget \nwas reduced this year. We have no choice but to try to do more with \nless. We must prioritize. As chairman of the relevant appropriations \ncommittee I would love to appropriate what everyone wants--point me to \nthe money machine.\n  Since the funding does not exist--how can we continue to mislead and \ngive the impression that things are possible when they are not. \nUnfortunately, there is a wide gap between the wish list in this bill \nand available resources.\n  Once again, I was hoping that this concern would be addressed, and am \ndisappointed that it was not. I guess I will follow the direction that \nthe distinguished committee chairman, Senator Chafee, provided during \nmarkup. The decisions will have to be made solely in appropriations.\n  I also need to address one final concern in relation to the proposed \ndisinfection-disinfection byproducts rule. The provision in the bill, \nin my opinion, greatly discourages the use of chlorine in water \ntreatment despite the many health benefits chlorine provides. The \nlanguage exempts this rule from cost-benefit analysis, sound science \nand comparative risk assessment. Considering the proposed cost of this \nrule, I am concerned that this will be an unfunded mandate to the \nStates and localities.\n  Once again, I thank Chairman Chafee, Senator Baucus, Senator \nKempthorne, and Senator Reid for their leadership and diligence on this \nissue. I learned long ago that you do not always get what you want. \nMaybe next time.\n  Mr. HATFIELD. Mr. President, the bill now before the Senate \nrepresents the best of this body. This legislation has been a long time \nin the works, and the final product shows the high level of commitment \nto this important area of policy.\n  There are few things that touch more aspects of life in Oregon than \nwater. From electricity, to fishing, forestry, and agriculture, no \nissue is more central to Oregon. And of course, the women, men, and \nchildren of my State, like all others, depend on a clean, healthy \nsupply of water to drink.\n  I have always supported the Safe Drinking Water Act. I voted for the \noriginal provision in 1974 and for the 1986 amendments. I am proud to \nbe an original cosponsor of the legislation introduced by a bipartisan \ngroup led by Senator Kempthorne.\n  In 1993, I met with over 150 representatives of water systems in \nOregon to discuss the approaching reauthorization of the Safe Drinking \nWater Act. I have also received hundreds of letters in the last year \nfrom system operators and local officials. These are truly committed \npublic servants who care deeply about the health of those in their \ncommunities. Their input has greatly assisted me in navigating through \nthis debate.\n  Mr. President, I believe water is our most vital resource. Water \nprovides much of the clean electric power produced in the Northwest. \nWater is vital to Oregon's strong agricultural production. And where \nwould our fisheries and forestry industries be without water? None of \nthese is of more intimate importance to each of us than the water we \nconsume. Our bodies cannot live without water.\n  Many inside the beltway call Oregon the land of liquid sunshine. They \nsay we do not tan, we rust. Well, we know that is not always true. We \nhave recently experienced the difficulties of a 6-year drought, which \ntaught us that water should never be taken for granted.\n  Today Oregonians are confronting the damage that can come about due \nto too much rain. Heavy rains have hit the Pacific Northwest in the \npast several days causing significant problems, particularly in Yamhill \nand Tillamook Counties. Our Governor has declared a state of emergency \nin these counties.\n  I ask unanimous consent that an article from today's Oregonian \nnewspaper be printed in the Record at the conclusion of my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. HATFIELD. The heavy rains have resulted in a landslide in \nPortland's renown Bull Run watershed, which has provided pure drinking \nwater from the Portland area for generations. The slide severely \ndamaged a bridge crossing which carries two of the three conduits which \nbring drinking water from the Bull Run watershed to Portland. No water \nis flowing through the two damaged pipes. The third pipe is underground \nand is still in operation. The two dams in the watershed are undamaged.\n  City officials have two main concerns: public health and adequate \nsupply. The Portland Water Bureau is closely monitoring both \ncontamination levels and turbidity. At this stage, no public health \nproblems have arisen.\n  The second issue is adequate supply. The city's daily water usage \nthis time of year is 90 million gallons per day. The one remaining \nconduit from Bull Run has a capacity of 75 million gallons per day. Any \nadditional supply up to the 90 million gallons per day will come from \nthe city's existing well fields in northeastern Portland near the \nColumbia River. In addition, over 270 million gallons is currently \nstored in reservoirs throughout the city.\n  Temporary repair of the two conduits from Bull Run could take weeks. \nA permanent fix could take months. Engineering studies are already \nunderway.\n  This shows us once again the importance of our precious water \nresources. It shows us the importance of providing our local officials \nwith the resources they need to respond to unpredictable challenges. \nThese officials must have the flexibility and the resources to carry \nout their responsibilities.\n  The legislation before us today meets that and many other goals. It \nis a significant accomplishment and I am proud to cosponsor it. Let me \ntake a moment to review the concerns I have heard from hundreds of \nOregon communities and take note of how these concerns have been \naddressed in the legislation before us.\n  As my colleagues recall, last year, many months of effort were put \ntoward crafting a bipartisan Safe Drinking Water Act reauthorization \nbill. I was proud to work closely with Senator Kerrey in an attempt to \nbridge the partisan differences that had emerged on the issue. The \nfinal product passed this body with overwhelming bipartisan support. \nEfforts to bring the bill to a conclusion late in the session were not \nsuccessful. I am pleased that many of the provisions in the bill before \nus today clearly emanate from last year's bill.\n\n\n                     Selection of New Contaminants\n\n  One of the most frequently cited problems with the current law is \nthat in the 1986 reauthorization, Congress required EPA to regulate 25 \nnew contaminants every 3 years, whether they need to or not. The bill \nbefore us eliminates this requirement and replaces it with a \nrequirement that EPA take action with respect to at least five \ncontaminants every 5 years beginning in 2001. This change will provide \ntremendous regulatory relief to EPA, States and water systems.\n\n\n                            Risk Assessment\n\n  Citizens of Oregon want to know that the contaminants EPA decides to \nregulate actually pose a health risk. They feel that the process of \nregulation is too often divorced from sound scientific evidence of risk \nfrom a contaminant.\n  This legislation requires EPA to use good science and assess the risk \nof contaminants before proceeding with regulation. The bill gives EPA \nauthority to regulate contaminants based on their actual occurrence in \ndrinking water and the real risks they pose. This will help EPA pursue \nregulations of the substances in drinking water that pose the greatest \nthreat to human health.\n\n\n                         Cost-Benefit Analysis\n\n  Nearly everyone I have spoken to in Oregon is concerned that EPA sets \nstandards for contaminants at a level that is unrelated to the level of \nhealth protection secured for the cost. Small systems need \nconsideration of risk even more than larger ones. The bill before us \nallows the Administrator the flexibility to set standards at levels \n\n[[Page S 17746]]\nother than those technically feasible and affordable to large systems, \nwhen it makes sense to do so in light of the risk reductions to be \nachieved and the compliance costs.\n  This is a critical element of reauthorization because it will create \na tighter and more explicit relationship between regulations, health \nprotection, and the compliance costs. I strongly commend Senators \nKempthorne, Chafee and Baucus for helping solve this thorny issue.\n\n\n                           Monitoring burden\n\n  Oregonians have complained that they monitor for contaminants that \nhave never been in their water. By ignoring differences among \ngeographic areas, we force local systems to devote resources to \ncontaminants they do not have. This takes vital resources from real \nproblems. This bill includes provisions similar to those added by \nSenator Kerrey and myself to the 1994 Safe Drinking Water Act \nreauthorization bill that will allow State drinking water programs to \ndesign monitoring programs that are appropriate to conditions faced by \ntheir State.\n\n\n                        Small System Flexibility\n\n  In Oregon, I learned that small systems are particularly hard hit by \nmany of the current Safe Drinking Water Act regulations because they do \nnot have the economies of scale of a large city. The bill before us \naddresses this problem in several ways. First, there is monitoring \nrelief for small systems. Moreover, systems serving less than 10,000 \npeople are eligible for a streamlined variance process and a small \nsystem technology program. A number of other flexibility provisions are \nincluded in the bill for small systems.\n\n\n                          Sufficient Resources\n\n  Oregonians have told me that the regulations governing drinking water \nare technical and expensive. In addition, GAO reported last year that \nState programs are underfunded.\n  To begin to solve this problem, the bill authorizes a $1 billion \nannual State revolving loan fund. The bill also authorizes an \nadditional $90 million for health effects research, a wise investment \nfor public health.\n\n\n                               Conclusion\n\n  I strongly urge the Senate to support this bill. These provisions \nstrengthen the Safe Drinking Water Act, not because they make the act \nmore rigid and stringent, but rather because they will help us--in \nCongress, at EPA, in the States and in every local water system--focus \ndrinking water resources on the most pressing problems and on the \nbiggest threats to health.\n  Again, let me commend the managers of this legislation for their fine \nefforts in bringing this matter to the floor in such a sound bipartisan \nmanner. I look forward to casting my vote in favor of this legislation.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n                  [From the Oregonian, Nov. 29, 1995]\n\n                        When It Rains, It Pours\n\n        (By Stuart Tomlinson, David R. Anderson, and Pat Forgey)\n\n       Oregonians paused to assess and clean up the damage caused \n     by heavy rain Monday and Tuesday and braced for another, \n     stronger storm expected to hit Wednesday.\n       Gov. John Kitzhaber declared a state of emergency Tuesday \n     in Tillamook and Yamhill counties because of landslides, \n     flooding and road washouts.\n       ``It's a mess,'' Tillamook County Commissioner Jerry Dove \n     said after a helicopter tour Tuesday. ``I have never seen \n     anything so devastating.''\n       Heavy rain falling on ground saturated during one of the \n     wettest Novembers on record sent several coastal rivers over \n     their banks, trapping motorists, closing schools and driving \n     residents from their homes.\n       By Tuesday afternoon, the rain slackened, which allowed the \n     river levels to subside. But forecasters warned of heavier \n     rains Wednesday, accompanied by winds that could reach 75 mph \n     on the coast.\n       ``The flood season has just begun,'' said Clint Stiger, a \n     hydrologist for the National Weather Service in Portland. \n     ``We're very concerned about the storm coming Wednesday \n     because there is just not much more moisture the soil can \n     contain.''\n       Flood alerts were posted Tuesday for rivers throughout \n     Western Washington, and Gov. Mike Lowry declared a state of \n     emergency in Clark County and 10 other Washington counties \n     late Tuesday. The declaration is retroactive to Nov. 7, when \n     heavy rains began causing flood damage in Washington.\n       While flooding was reported on the Clackamas River, Johnson \n     Creek and the Tualatin and Salmon rivers outside Portland, \n     the northern Oregon coast was hardest hit.\n       Kitzhaber's emergency declaration will allow the Oregon \n     Department of Transportation to use highway safety money for \n     emergency road repairs. The declaration also means the \n     governor can use the Oregon National Guard to assist in \n     flood cleanup or for security.\n       More than 6 inches of rain fell in about 36 hours at Lee's \n     Camp, a reporting station outside Tillamook. A rain gauge at \n     a Tillamook city reservoir can measure a maximum of 7.5 \n     inches, but it overflowed in less than 24 hours Monday night \n     and Tuesday morning.\n       Snow that had fallen during the weekend melted under the \n     onslaught of record warm temperatures. With 58 degrees, \n     Portland broke a record for the date set in 1982, while \n     Eugene had a record-tying 60 degrees.\n       Portland is inching toward breaking the all-time rain-fall \n     record for November, which was 11.57 inches in 1942.\n       By 10 p.m. Tuesday, rainfall at Portland International \n     Airport reached 10.28 inches.\n       Rain was the main problem Tuesday, but high winds could \n     bring problems throughout the day Wednesday.\n       Forcasters issued high wind warnings for the north and \n     central Oregon coast through Wednesday, with gusts up to 75 \n     mph on exposed headlands and gusts to 40-plus mph inland.\n       Heavy rain also hit Eastern Oregon. The National Weather \n     Service issued small stream advisories for portions of \n     Umatilla County.\n       Snow levels rose to about 8,000 feet by Tuesday, but they \n     were expected to plummet Thursday and Friday to about 4,000 \n     feet, with more snow forecast for the northern Oregon \n     Cascades.\n       A storm containing moisture from nearly 1,000 miles \n     southwest of Hawaii brought the rain and warm temperatures to \n     the state. It's part of a pattern of storms that rake the \n     region during November and December.\n       Oregon is on the edge between warm, tropical air to the \n     south and colder air to the north.\n       ``Where the two air masses come together, there is often a \n     violent meeting on the boundary,'' said state climatologist \n     George Taylor. ``The atmosphere is trying to reach \n     equilibrium.''\n       So were Tillamook County residents.\n       Crews worked all Tuesday to reach people trapped in their \n     homes by mudslides, mostly on the Trask and Kilchis River \n     roads.\n       By late Tuesday, about 50 homes, with as many as 200 \n     residents, on Trask River Road still were cut off by 15 to 18 \n     landslides. Some routes were cleared only to be closed again \n     by slides or flooding.\n       Tillamook County Sheriff Thomas Dye said a U.S. Coast Guard \n     helicopter dropped a paramedic in the area to check on a 3-\n     year-old girl suffering from the flu. The girl checked out \n     fine, and the paramedic left by helicopter.\n       Jon Oshel, the county public works director, said he hoped \n     to have Trask River Road open by dark. Kilchis River Road \n     presented a bigger problem, although only about 10 families \n     still were cut off.\n       ``We lost a major piece of road there that's just flat gone \n     into the river,'' Oshel said.\n       Tillamook County Commissioner Ken Burdick lives up Trask \n     River Road, where he saw what he called the worse devastation \n     in 42 years.\n       ``We sat there last night until 4 a.m., listening to \n     canyons blow out,'' he said.\n       Burdick didn't get out of his house until late Tuesday, \n     when county road crews working their way up the Trask River \n     reached him.\n       During a helicopter tour, Dove said every canyon they \n     looked at east of Tillamook had been hit with a gully-washer, \n     blocking roads, washing out culverts and carrying trees and \n     stumps downriver.\n       Dove said he saw houses flooded and dairy farmers cut off \n     from their cows.\n       The Wilson River Highway, the main road between Tillamook \n     and Portland, was closed between Tillamook and Glendale by \n     landslides. The road wasn't expected to be open to through \n     traffic until late Wednesday, traffic officials said.\n       Mike Fredericks, who lives along the Wilson River, was \n     forced from his trailer by rising floodwaters. When he came \n     back Tuesday, he expected his trailer to be in Tillamook Bay.\n       When he left the night before, his trailer was an island \n     buffeted by what used to be the hillside across the Wilson \n     River Highway.\n       Because of a clear-cut last summer, he said, the culvert \n     that drains the hill clogged Monday night.\n       The water had to go somewhere. When he went next door to \n     talk to his neighbor, a veteran of six years on the river, \n     Fredericks found out where.\n       ``As soon as we turned our heads, down came the hill,'' \n     Fredericks said. ``The creek was hitting the trailer house \n     and fanning around each side.''\n       Fredericks' cat, Cubby, was washed away. His mailbox, \n     telephone bill and all, ended up about 50 yards from the \n     house.\n       The trailer, which is about five miles east of Tillamook, \n     survived the deluge and moved not an inch toward the Wilson \n     River. If it weren't for the mess in his yard, Fredericks \n     would have felt fortunate.\n       The new stream cut a 10-foot-deep gully across the lawn, \n     halfway between his trailer home and recreational vehicle. \n     Sheared logs, about a foot of mud and hundreds of basketball-\n     size rocks littered his lawn.\n\n[[Page S 17747]]\n\n       In Yamhill County, the Three Rivers Highway dropped about 4 \n     feet at milepost 13.5. The highway was reopened after \n     emergency repairs were completed.\n       Although the rains were impressive, river levels still were \n     below historic flood levels.\n       During a January 1990 flood, the Nehalem River crested at \n     25 feet; Tuesday's peak reached 16.2 feet. In January 1972, \n     the Wilson River crested at 16.9 feet; Tuesday's peak reached \n     13.2 feet.\n       Flooding caused the aptly named Roaring River Bridge, at \n     the confluence of the Roaring and Clackamas rivers about 17 \n     miles southeast of Estacada, to sink two feet Tuesday \n     morning.\n       A large log, probably loosened from an embankment eroded by \n     the floodwater, rammed and bent the bridge pilings, said Gary \n     McNeel, an assistant district manage of the Oregon Department \n     of Transportation office. The 45-year-old bridge serves about \n     1,100 vehicles a day.\n       In Clackamas County, firefighters and the sheriff's \n     deputies evacuated residents of the Eagle Creek Mobile Home \n     Park near storm-swollen Eagle Creek for several hours early \n     Tuesday.\n       Worst hit were Terry and Toni Hirbeck. Their doublewide at \n     30773 S.E. Creekside Lane, about a mile upstream from the \n     Clackamas River, had water up to its subflooring and no yard \n     at all.\n       ``I woke Terry up at 11 o'clock last night to tell him the \n     water was coming up,'' said Toni Hirbeck, 33. ``And from 11 \n     o'clock to midnight, the water rose so much that stuff was \n     already floating.''\n       By 2:30 a.m., firefighters from the Boring Fire Department \n     had to rig a rope across the lane as a lifeline so the lane \n     could be forded more safely.\n\n\n                              weather woes\n\n                               The coast\n\n       Tillamook: High water and mudslides closed dozens of roads. \n     Many residents were stranded in homes and cars. The Wilson \n     River Highway, the main road between Tillamook and Portland, \n     was blocked by slides. School districts in north and central \n     Tillamook County closed Tuesday, after officials decided it \n     was to risky to send buses out.\n\n                            Multnomah County\n\n       Bull Run: A mudslide smashed two of three conduits \n     supplying Portland's water from the Bull Run watershed \n     Tuesday, sharply reducing the Portland area's water delivery \n     system. Officials planned to avert a water shortage my \n     drawing on reservoirs and turning on backup wells along the \n     Columbia River.\n\n                            Clackamas County\n\n       Roaring River: Flooding caused Oregon 224's Roaring River \n     Bridge, over the Roaring River at the confluence with the \n     Clackamas River about 17 miles southeast of Estacada, to sink \n     about the two feet Tuesday. A large log rammed into and bent \n     the pilings of the 45-year-old bridge that serves about 1,100 \n     vehicles a day. Workers are expected to complete a temporary \n     plate-steel bridge in about a week.\n       Clackamas River: The river was above flood stage at several \n     sites, but particularly threatening at Carver. Residents of a \n     mobile home park were bracing for possible evacuation.\n       Eagle Creek: Crews evacuated families from 12 homes about \n     1:30 a.m. Tuesday but allowed them to return later in the \n     morning.\n       Salmon river: In the Mount Hood area, a few families were \n     driven from their homes Monday night.\n       Sanbag help: County officials recommend calling 655--8224 \n     to get information about sandbags and available help.\n\n                              Clark County\n\n       Salmon Creek: A handful of residents north of Vancouver \n     evacuated their homes Tuesday when Salmon Creek overflowed, \n     sending several feet of water into basements, submerging \n     lawns and uprooting trees. Homeowners and fire District 6 \n     personnel sandbagged six homes at 136th Way and Salmon Creek \n     Avenue to stem the damage.\n       Road Closures: Southeast Evergreen Highway was closed at \n     190th Avenue by water 3-feet deep across the pavement. Water \n     crested above the guardrail and closed Leadbetter Road at \n     232nd Avenue north of Lacamas Lake.\n\n                             Eastern Oregon\n\n       The storm caused flooding and power failures across much of \n     Eastern Oregon. Several families on the Umatilla Indian \n     Reservation near Pendleton wee stranded when the Umatilla \n     river flooded rural roads. Eight inches of snow fell on the \n     Ladd Canyon mountain pass between Baker City and La Grande, \n     causing a massive tie-up.\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. President, the Safe Drinking Water Act is important \nto every community in this country--large or small--rich or poor. This \npublic health statute ensures that our citizens have clean water to \ndrink when they turn on the tap. But this law is important for another \nreason as well--it can be very costly for small rural communities that \nsimply do not have the financial resources necessary to comply with \nmany of the stringent standards and monitoring requirements required by \nthe act. All of us in Congress have been sensitized to the issue of \nunfunded Federal mandates because of the regulatory excesses brought \nout by the previous reauthorization of the Safe Drinking Water Act.\n  The Clinton administration makes the claim that Republicans don't \ncare about the environment but that is pure balderdash. We care about \nthe environment just as much and we are passing this legislation \nbecause we do care. We also care about real people--cities and small \ntowns--and that is why we are putting some common sense back into the \nlaw.\n  The environmental groups may think that unfunded mandates are part of \nwhat they call an unholy trinity, but I can tell you that to a Member \nof Congress this issue is a very real concern. When I travel around my \nState and stop in small towns I always hear complaints about the Clean \nWater Act and the Safe Drinking Water Act and unfunded mandates.\n  The last time we reauthorized the Safe Drinking Water Act we caused a \nnear crisis in small town America. Thousands of small towns are \nfinancially unable to meet Federal drinking water requirements and need \nhelp finding less expensive ways to make their water safe to drink. A \nrecent GAO report said that meeting Federal drinking water standards is \nan acute problem for around 50,000 small communities that account for \n90 percent of the drinking water violations. We need to find more cost-\neffective ways to provide these small towns with safe drinking water or \nwe are going to be wholly discredited in the eyes of the American \npublic.\n  The EPA estimates that it will cost small communities $3 billion to \ncomply with current Federal drinking water regulations and another $20 \nbillion to repair and replace and expand their current drinking water \ninfrastructure and to meet future needs. It has been estimated that 70 \npercent of the costs will be incurred by small communities that account \nfor 10 percent of the population. These communities cannot afford that \nkind of expense and I don't think a simple revolving loan fund will \nhelp enough.\n  Neither the Federal Government nor the States have developed policies \nthat will reduce costs through less expensive technology or development \nof better financing and funding mechanisms. This situation must be \nremedied. We need to make direct grants to small communities along with \na loan program and more importantly we need to revise monitoring \nrequirements and change the ways standards are being set.\n  The bill we are considering is an improvement in this regard, but I \ndon't think it goes far enough. The environmental groups have taken a \npaternalistic approach to this issue and they don't believe the States \nshould be given flexibility in carrying out the act. This isn't the \nclassic case where it is industry versus the greenies. This is \nGovernors, mayors, State legislators, and water administrators saying \n``Congress must do something radical to fix this program or we are \ngoing to go broke.''\n  I don't think the committee bill goes as far as I would have liked in \ndirecting EPA to consider cost and good science, but I think the final \nversion represents a genuine effort to improve current law and it will \ncause EPA to take a more realistic approach to the standard setting \nissue in the future. For this reason I intend to vote for this bill and \nI trust the President will sign it when Congress sends it on to the \nWhite House.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, Senator Cohen and I would like to engage \nthe Senator from Rhode Island and the Senator from Idaho in a colloquy.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. I would be pleased to participate in a colloquy with the \nSenators from Maine.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. I would be happy to engage the Senators from Maine in \na colloquy as well.\n  Ms. SNOWE. As the Senators from Rhode Island and Idaho are aware, a \nnumber of very small, economically disadvantaged communities across the \ncountry are having serious difficulties trying to comply with the \nsurface water treatment rule. Compliance with this rule can be very \nexpensive, sometimes requiring a disadvantaged community with less than \n500 residents to build a filtration plant costing over $1 million. \nUnfortunately, many of these communities cannot afford to construct \nthese expensive facilities without substantial Federal assistance, and \nthat assistance has not been adequate to meet the demand. This \npredicament \n\n[[Page S 17748]]\nhas caused a lot of frustration in certain small towns, particularly \nsince the quality of their local water sources, which are often located \nin isolated rural areas, can be quite high and is not vulnerable to \nimminent degradation.\n  Mr. COHEN. I concur with Senator Snowe on this point. There are 19 \nsmall, economically disadvantaged towns in Maine currently under \ncompliance order to install filtration systems as required by the SWTR, \nand the deadlines for those orders will be expiring over the next year. \nWithout adequate Federal financial assistance, these disadvantaged \ncommunities will not be able to comply with the filtration requirement.\n  We understand that section 13(b) of S. 1316 allows a State to exempt \nan economically disadvantaged public water system serving a population \nof less than 3,300 people from the requirements of a national primary \ndrinking water regulation as they relate to maximum contaminant \nstandards or treatment techniques for a period of up to 3 years, as \nlong as there is a reasonable expectation that the system will receive \nFederal financial assistance during the exemption period. In addition, \nthe bill would allow a State to renew this exemption in 2-year \nincrements up to an additional 6 years.\n  Ms. SNOWE. We further understand that the authorities available under \nsection 13(b) apply to the surface water treatment rule, as they do to \nother national primary drinking water regulations, and that section \n13(b) would therefore allow a State to provide an exemption to a system \nserving an economically disadvantaged community in the predicament that \nwe just described, provided the system meets the terms and conditions \nset forth in the section.\n  We would like to ask the chairman of the Environmental and Public \nWorks Committee, Senator Chafee, and the chief sponsor of S. 1316, \nSenator Kempthorne, if our understanding of this provision is correct.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. The Maine Senators' understanding of section 13(b) is \ncorrect. This section does apply to the surface water treatment rule as \nwell as other Federal drinking water regulations. I very much recognize \nthe problems that small disadvantaged towns are facing in complying \nwith some of the expensive requirements of the act, and we hope that \nsection 13(b) and other sections of S. 1316 will address these \nproblems.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. I concur with Senator Chafee that the Maine Senators' \nunderstanding of section 13(b) is correct. The surface water treatment \nrule is covered under this section. One of my major interests in \ndrafting S. 1316 was to find ways to ease the compliance burden of the \nact on small, disadvantaged communities while maintaining public health \nprotections. Section 13(b) is one of the provisions in the bill that \nwill help us achieve this important goal.\n  Ms. SNOWE. We thank the Senators for clarifying this important \nmatter.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, there is an issue on which I would \nlike to engage in a colloquy and get the support of the chairman of the \nsubcommittee. I understand that efforts to gain an accurate and valid \ndetermination of drinking water quality often can be compromised by \nbrief weather changes. Current regulations call for water quality \ncompliance of a contaminant to be based on the annual average of four \nquarterly samples. But when quarterly samples are collected during such \nbrief periods, inaccurate and misleading impressions of the water's \nannual average quality can result.\n  This situation is especially prevalent with respect to determination \nof agricultural and other non-point contaminants. spring thunderstorms \noften follow farmland tillage operations and necessary applications of \nfertilizers and crop protection chemicals, and natural storm water \nrunoff can briefly elevate concentrations of these contaminants in \nwater. A single spring quarter sample taken immediately after a major \nthunderstorm can put the water supplier out of compliance for the \nentire year and result in expensive and unnecessary water treatment.\n  More frequent sampling would give a more accurate assessment of the \nlong-term exposure to these seasonal contaminants. Mr. Chairman, it is \nmy impression that the provisions for alternative monitoring programs \nauthorized in section 19 of the bill would authorize each State with \nprimary enforcement responsibility to allow utilities to conduct time-\nweighted sampling during the quarters of concern. To balance accuracy \nwith economic considerations, such alternative monitoring programs \ncould allow utilities to composite monthly or more frequent samples for \na single quarterly analysis for those contaminants which are known to \nbe stable in storage.\n  Is this the understanding of the chairman of this committee?\n  Mr. CHAFEE. If the Senator will yield, Mr. President, that is \ncorrect.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. I thank the chairman of the committee for his support \nand clarification of this section.\n\n\n                           REGULATION OF ZINC\n\n  Mr. THOMPSON. I would like to engage the majority managers of the \nbill in a brief colloquy concerning the regulation of zinc--an \nessential trace element--under the Safe Drinking Water Act. As they are \nundoubtedly aware, there are a number of studies showing that children, \nparticularly poor children, are seriously deficient in their intake of \nzinc. Drinking water is one important source of zinc for those \nchildren.\n  The managers are surely also aware that the Environmental Protection \nAgency has established at least one reference dose--or safe exposure \nlevel--that allows for less than the recommended dietary allowance for \nzinc for infants, children and possibly pregnant and nursing mothers, \ndespite the needs of these particularly sensitive groups. In light of \nthe essential nature of, and the recommended dietary allowances \nestablished for, zinc, is it the manager's view that EPA should \nconsider these factors when regulating additional trace elements such \nas zinc?\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. I agree with the Senator from Tennessee that EPA \nshould take into account: First, the essential nature of the zinc, and \nsecond, the recommended dietary allowances for the element for infants, \nchildren and pregnant and nursing women, when deciding whether or not \nthe essential trace element zinc should be regulated under the Safe \nDrinking Water Act.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. I agree with the statement of the Senator from Idaho.\n\n\n             small public water systems technology centers\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, the bill before the Senate, S. 1316, the \nSafe Drinking Water Act Amendments of 1995, provides for the \nestablishment of a grant program, to be administered by the \nEnvironmental Protection Agency [EPA], that would fund not fewer than \nfive Small Public Water Systems Technology Assistance Centers across \nthe United States. I commend the Committee on Environment and Public \nWorks for the action it has taken in this regard. I would, however, ask \nfor some clarification of the criteria listed in the new subsection \n(h). The criteria listed in the bill reference technical assistance \nsupport activities that would be provided by regional centers. My \nquestion to the managers of the bill is:\n  Would a national center engaged in the following activities meet the \ncriteria listed for the proposed Small Public Water Systems Technology \nCenters?\n  A clearinghouse service engaged in both the collection and \ndistribution, at no or low cost, of technical literature and other \neducational resource materials, including government documents, \nresearch papers, video tapes, brochures, and diagrams;\n  A toll-free telephone assistance and referral service providing \naccess to engineers and other specialists;\n  A quarterly newsletter service, published at no cost to subscribers, \nthat addresses such topics as the health effects of contaminated \nwaters, small community assistance providers, small water system \nregulatory issues, and water system operation maintenance; and\n  A toll-free electronic bulletin board service that enables users to \npost questions and have those questions answered, as well as to read \nand comment on water-related topics.\n  In reading the bill and the committee's report, I would presume that \na national center that provides such services would be eligible to \nreceive funding under the grant program established in the bill. I \nwould simply ask the manager of the bill if this is correct.\n\n[[Page S 17749]]\n\n  Mr. CHAFEE. The Senator is correct. Let me add that the concept of \nproviding grants to regional centers that the Senator refers to is \nprimarily intended to ensure that such centers are distributed \nthroughout our Nation. It is not intended to limit the scope of \nassistance these centers can provide.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. I would also add that the regional technology \nassistance centers are intended to be sited in areas that are \nrepresentative of their region in regards to the water supply needs of \nsmall rural communities. In this respect, these centers are supposed to \nhave expertise in the particular water supply problems associated with \nthat region.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. The Senator from West Virginia is correct, however, in \npointing out that the information these centers provide can also be \nnational in scope. The access to this information, therefore, should \nnot be limited to any particular State or region. In providing \nassistance on a national basis, these centers should coordinate their \nactivities to minimize any duplication of effort and to maximize the \nutility of the information provided.\n  Mr. BYRD. I thank the managers of the bill for providing this \nclarification.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I am pleased to join with my colleagues \nin support of the Safe Drinking Water Act. This bill represents a \nbipartisan effort which couples protection of public health and welfare \nwith the flexibility necessary for cost-effective implementation.\n  The bill contains a number of provisions that are of particular \ninterest to New York State. The components of the bill which provide \nfor watershed protection directly impact the 9 million residents of New \nYork City who rely on the Croton, Catskill, and Delaware watersheds to \nprovide approximately 1.4 billion gallons of water each day. The State \nof New York recently announced the establishment of a partnership \nbetween New York City and the communities located within the watershed \nregion. This agreement will effectively limit contamination of the \nwater supply, preventing the need for a multibillion-dollar water \nfiltration facility. The bill would authorize up to $15 million per \nyear for 7 years to help fund the implementation and assessment of \ndemonstration projects as part of the New York City Water Protection \nProgram. Thus, the bill supports New York State's efforts to achieve \nprudent, cost-effective protection of the quality of New York City's \ndrinking water.\n  A second provision will provide long-term benefits for the Great \nLakes region by establishing a program to test chemical pollutants \nbelieved to cause so-called estrogenic effects in human populations. \nThese effects may result in a variety of cancers--especially breast \ncancer--in addition to affecting the human reproductive system \nadversely. Pollutants which may be associated with these effects are \nknown to accumulate in bodies of water and are pervasive in the Great \nLakes System. The testing program sponsored by this provision will \nincorporate quality science and peer-review to allow the Administrator \nof EPA to identify such substances and take effective action to prevent \nhuman exposure.\n  Unfortunately, despite Senator Chafee's valiant efforts today, it has \nbecome necessary to eliminate section 28 of the bill which, was \nreported unanimously out of committee. This section would have required \nthe EPA Administrator to compare and rank various sources of pollution \nwith respect to their relative degree of risk to human health and the \nenvironment, and evaluate the costs and benefits of existing \nregulations. I believe this analysis, which would have been included in \na peer-reviewed report to the Congress, would have provided us with \ninformation critical to enhancing the effectiveness of the Nation's \nenvironmental programs.\n  I would point out that the requirement to conduct cost-benefit \nanalyses and to evaluate the effectiveness of environmental legislation \nwas first incorporated in the Clean Air Act amendments of 1990. I felt \nit was very important when passing the acid rain provisions of the \nClean Air Act to evaluate their effectiveness, and requirements to \nconduct such an evaluation were incorporated in that law.\n  In any case, because of the importance of safe drinking water \nlegislation, I urge my colleagues to join me in support of the Safe \nDrinking Water Act. I extend my sincere gratitude to Senator Chafee for \nhis support of future consideration of the issue by the Environment and \nPublic Works committee. I intend to work with him and other interested \nMembers to secure passage of a bill authorizing these important \nstudies. I have introduced legislation to achieve this end in the past \nthree Congresses, and I look forward to the upcoming hearings on the \nmeasure.\n\n\n                      Estrogenic Screening Program\n\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, I want to commend and thank the managers \nof this bill for including in the manager's amendment package our \namendment establishing an estrogenic chemicals screening program at \nEPA. This amendment is identical to an amendment that was adopted \nunanimously by the Senate when offered by my senior colleague from New \nYork and myself during consideration of the Safe Drinking Water Act in \nthe 103d Congress.\n  The amendment requires EPA to gather information that may prove \nessential in the war against breast cancer. Specifically, this \namendment will require the EPA to develop and implement a testing \nprogram to identify pesticides and other chemicals that can cause \nestrogenic and other biological effects in humans, and to report their \nfindings to Congress within 4 years.\n  This amendment is critical in view of growing evidence linking \nenvironmental chemicals that are capable of mimicking or blocking the \naction of the hormone estrogen to a host of developmental and \nreproductive abnormalities in wildlife and humans. The most alarming \nfindings suggest a link between exposure to these chemicals and the \ndramatic increase in human breast cancer that has become so tragically \napparent in our Nation over the past several decades.\n  In 1960, the chances of a woman developing breast cancer were 1 in \n14. Today, they are one in eight. This year alone, breast cancer will \nstrike an estimated 182,000 American women, and will take the lives of \nover 46,000. It has become the most common female cancer and the \nleading cause of death among American women between the ages of 35 and \n54.\n  For years, researchers have understood that breast cancer is \ninfluenced by how much estrogen a woman produces. If you take the \nexisting known risk factors--including early puberty, late menopause, \ndelayed childbearing, or having no children at all--they have one thing \nin common: they all contribute to a high lifetime exposure to estrogen. \nThere is clear evidence that the more estrogen a woman is exposed to in \nher lifetime, the higher her risk of developing breast cancer.\n  Recently, scientists have been taking a close look at the relation \nbetween so-called xeno-estrogens and increased breast cancer risk. It \nis theorized that these estrogenic materials--which include pesticides \nand other chemicals capable of affecting the internal production of the \nhormone estrogen--may hold the key to explaining some of the 70 percent \nof all breast cancer cases not associated with any of the existing \nknown risk factors.\n  The research is compelling.\n  Perhaps the most startling findings are those of Dr. Mary Wolff of \nMt. Sinai Medical Center, whose research involved the estrogenic \nchemicals PCB and DDE, which is a breakdown product of the pesticide \nDDT. Dr. Wolff tested the blood of 58 women with breast cancer and \ncompared it to that of 171 women who were cancer-free, taking pains to \nensure that the women were identical when it came to age, childbearing \nhistory, and every other characteristic known to influence breast \ncancer risk. She found that the women who had developed breast cancer \nhad PCB levels in their blood that were 15 percent higher than the \ncancer-free women, and DDE levels that were 35 percent higher. She also \ndiscovered that as the level of DDE increased, so did the risk of \ndeveloping breast cancer--to the extent that the women with the highest \nDDE levels were four times as likely to get breast cancer as those with \nthe lowest levels.\n  A subsequent study by Canadian researchers, published on February 2, \n1994, in the Journal of the National Cancer Institute, found a further \nlink between DDE levels in breast tissue and the development of breast \ncancer. \n\n[[Page S 17750]]\n In this case, higher DDE levels were associated with a higher risk for \na particular-type of breast cancer which feeds on estrogen--a type of \nbreast cancer which, according to researchers, has made up a larger and \nlarger portion of the increase in breast cancer in recent years. In the \nwords of the study's authors, ``this study supports the hypothesis that \nexposure to estrogenic organochlorine may affect the incidence of \nhormone-responsive breast cancer.''\n  The women of Long Island, NY, have long suspected a connection \nbetween the region's unusually high breast cancer rates and the \nexceptional concentrations of DDT and other potentially estrogenic \npesticides that were once applied in an effort to rid former potato \nfields of a parasite known as the golden nematode.\n  Women who have grown up and raised families in residential \nsubdivisions that were built on top of these abandoned potato fields \nhave good reasons to be suspicious. Not least of these is the recent \nfinding that if you are a woman and you have lived in Nassau County for \nmore than 40 years, your risk of getting breast cancer is 72 percent \ngreater than a woman of the same age who has lived in the county for \nless than 20 years.\n  The National Cancer Institute is now in the process of further \nexamining the connection between breast cancer and xeno-estrogens as \npart of a comprehensive study into the causes of Long Island's high \nbreast cancer rates. Their findings--expected within the next several \nyears--will contribute greatly to our knowledge base about this \nimportant issue.\n  As we wait for the results of this and other studies, it is vital \nthat we begin to systematically identify those pesticides and other \ncompounds present in the environment that possess estrogenic \nproperties. We must do this so we will be ready, should further \nresearch confirm a clear link between these substances and breast \ncancer, to take appropriate steps to protect the public.\n  This amendment will give us some of the information needed to begin \ntaking these steps should they become necessary.\n  The amendment would require the EPA to utilize appropriate, \nscientifically validated test systems as part of a screening program to \nidentify pesticides and other substances capable of altering estrogenic \nactivity in the human body.\n  Several quick and inexpensive test systems have been developed in \nrecent years which could potentially be utilized in such a screening \nprogram. Examples include tests developed by Dr. Ana M. Soto of Tufts \nUniversity School of Medicine in Boston and Dr. Leon Bradlow of the \nStrang-Cornell Cancer Research Laboratory in New York, as well as a \nthird test utilizing state-of-the-art biotechnology techniques \ndescribed recently in Environmental Health Perspectives by Dr. John \nMcLachlan of the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences.\n  Because these tests are simple, inexpensive and quick, they are well \nsuited for the kind of large-scale screening needed to identify \npotentially hazardous estrogenic compounds. Since reproduction requires \ncomplex interactions between hormones and cells in the intact body, the \ntests are not intended to replace existing animal testing models, but \nto complement them by quickly flagging suspect compounds which can then \nbe targeted for additional testing or public health approaches.\n  Given the availability of these new techniques, I was shocked when I \nlearned 2 years ago that EPA does not routinely screen pesticides for \nestrogenicity. I raised this concern in testimony before a joint \nhearing of House Subcommittee on Health and the Environment and the \nSenate Committee on Labor and Human Resources on September 21, 1993. In \nmy testimony I called for a much more aggressive EPA response to the \nevidence which has been put forward linking estrogenic chemicals and \nbreast cancer.\n  The EPA has now become more interested in this area--for which I \ncommend and encourage them. But I would like to encourage them further \nby requiring them to undertake the kind of widespread screening program \nthat our Nation's breast cancer epidemic demands, utilizing \nappropriate, scientifically validated testing techniques, coupled with \na research program to understand the health risks associated with \nexposure to xenoestrogens.\n  This amendment would ensure that such a program is underway within 1 \nyear, and would give the EPA Administrator a deadline of 2 years to \nimplement a peer-reviewed plan, with a report to Congress due in 4 \nyears detailing the program's findings and any recommendations for \nfurther action the administrator deems appropriate.\n  Mr. President, we simply cannot afford to wait until we have a \nsmoking gun before we act to identify those chemicals in the \nenvironment that are estrogenic. Breast cancer is claiming the lives of \nwomen in this country at a rate of one death every 11 minutes. It would \nbe unconscionable not to arm ourselves with crucial knowledge about \nchemicals that may be contributing to this scourge so that we can \nrapidly implement appropriate public health measures when scientific \nresearch indicates they are warranted.\n  Mr. President, this amendment will ensure that we are armed with this \ncrucial information, and I again thank the managers for agreeing to \naccept this amendment.\n\n\n                 Pesticide Chemical Screening Amendment\n\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, would the Senator from New York yield \nfor some questions regarding this amendment?\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Certainly.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Given the concerns that reproductive effects in \nwildlife may be linked to endocrine disruption, some are concerned that \nthe amendment is too limited because it focuses on human breast cancer. \nDoes the amendment take a position on this issue?\n  Mr. D'AMATO. I recognize the concern that environmental estrogens and \nother hormone mimics may cause significant effects on nonhuman species. \nHowever, the top priority of this amendment is to learn more about \nsubstances that may lead to breast and other related forms of cancer in \nhumans. It is silent about the possibility that effects may occur in \nother species and leaves that judgment to the Administrator.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. I have heard concerns raised about other endocrine and \nimmune system impairments too. Does the discretion provided the \nAdministrator under this amendment extend to health effects other than \nbreast cancer?\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Yes. For example, if the Administrator so chose, she \ncould include screening for male reproductive effects, effects to the \nimmune system, and so forth. Would the Senator address a question about \nthe scope of the amendment?\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Certainly.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. When the results of the screening study become \navailable, subsection g(6) directs the Administrator to ``. . . take \nsuch action, including appropriate regulatory action by rule or by \norder under statutory authority available to the Administrator, as is \nnecessary to ensure the protection of public health.'' Is the intent \nthat the Administrator regulate all substances found positive in the \nstudy under the amendment?\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. No. The testing called for in the amendment is a \nscreening study to identify active and inert pesticide ingredients that \nmimic estrogens. It is a hazard identification process designed to \nidentify the magnitude of the potential problem and to help set \npriorities for the future. As we learned from the experience with the \nAmes test for carcinogens in the 1970's and 1980's, hazard \nidentification tests do not provide enough information to be the sole \nbasis for regulatory action. Having said that, let me quickly note that \nthe Administrator may have additional information about the exposure \nlevels, or about the relationship between exposure and effect for \ncertain of the substances to be tested such that she makes a risk \nmanagement decision that regulatory action is needed. If, as a result \nof such evaluations, the Administrator finds a substance likely has a \npotential adverse effect in humans she must take appropriate regulatory \naction. The amendment gives her authority to do so through appropriate \nregulatory action under the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide and \nRodenticide Act or the Toxic Substances Control Act or under other \nauthority available to the Administrator.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. What happens once the screening study called for in this \namendment is completed? \n\n[[Page S 17751]]\n\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. The screening study will identify certain pesticide \ningredients that mimic estrogens and perhaps other hormones. \nConsequently, people will be concerned, some very concerned, about \ntheir health. It is important to be realistic, honest and responsible \nthroughout the design and conduct of this study so that we do not \ncreate undue apprehension, but it is also important to inform the \npublic and to take action where significant hazards are identified.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. The Senator raises something that I feel very strongly \nabout. Frankly, I am extremely worried about the health impacts \nassociated with exposure to pesticides, and I am deeply concerned that \nthey may lead to diseases such as breast cancer. At the same time I \nthink that the women of Long Island and elsewhere have suffered enough \nanguish, and I do not want to scare people unnecessarily.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. The Senator raises an extremely important issue--how \nbest to determine whether pesticides, a widespread class of \nenvironmental chemicals, pose a potential risk without creating \nunwarranted public concern. An important part of this process should be \na risk communication strategy to identify the likely outcomes, and to \nkeep the public informed and aware of the purpose of the study, \nincluding its strengths and limitations. It is important not to over \npromise and raise false expectations.\n  Turning to another issue, could the Senator elaborate on what is \nintended by the exemption described in subsection g(4)?\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Of course. While it is our intent to require broad \nscreening of active and inert pesticide ingredients, we recognize that \nthere are biologic substances, and perhaps other substances, that the \nSecretary will find do not warrant testing because she concludes that \nthey do not mimic estrogen in humans. Subsection g(4) would allow her \nto exempt such substances from the screening program called for under \nthis amendment. We expect the Secretary to rely upon the best available \nscientific information in identifying substances to be exempted.\n  Would the Senator like to comment on why the amendment requires that \nthe testing requirements and communication strategies be reviewed by \nthe Science Advisory Panel and Science Advisory Board, and any other \nreview group the Administrator deems appropriate before finalizing the \nrequirements.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Yes, certainly. It is because we are just coming to \nlearn that certain environmental pollutants mimic naturally occurring \nhormones and that they may contribute to breast cancer, reproductive \nfailure, and other diseases. There is no consensus about the magnitude \nand nature of the problem, and so it will be controversial, with those \non opposite sides of the issue voicing strong opinions. It is our \nintent that EPA be as responsible and credible as it can be. This means \nthat the Administrator should work with expert scientists from \ngovernment, academia, industry, and the public health sector to select \ncriteria for what constitutes a validated test, to select the set of \nvalidated tests to be used, and to design the protocols for study. She \nmay wish to engage organizations such as the National Academy of \nSciences or other appropriate independent scientific organizations for \nassistance.\n  Similarly, when the study is completed, the report to Congress \nrequired under subsection g(7) should reflect guidance from the \nscientific community, summarizing the findings of the screening study, \nand recommending followup actions, as necessary.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Could the Senator discuss the potential followup actions \nthat might be recommended?\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Obviously, that depends on the outcome of the screening \nprogram. If only a few substances screen positive, the followup might \ninclude conducting more detailed tests on each substance that tests \npositive; if a number are positive, however, priorities must be set to \nidentify those chemicals of greatest concern for which dose-response \nrelationships are needed. Though we may wish it were not so, we simply \ncannot do everything at once.\n  The criteria for setting priorities may well be to select those \nchemicals found most often in the environment and in the highest \nconcentrations, those that are most active or that bioaccumulate, those \nfor which there are testable hypotheses for action, and those which are \nrepresentative of specific categories of chemicals. The goal is to \ndevelop plausible biologically-based risk-assessment models for use by \nEPA and others to inform their risk management decisions.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Does the Senator know just what kinds of follow-up \nstudies will likely need to be conducted and how much they will cost?\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. The amendment is silent on exactly what additional \nstudies to require after the screening study because we want to benefit \nfrom the screening results and from EPA's guidance before deciding \nwhat, if anything, to do next. The determination about how much science \nis needed before making a regulatory decision is a policy call. There \nwill never be enough information to unambiguously answer every question \nabout environmental safety. When the EPA makes its report to Congress \nit would be appropriate to examine just how much science is recommended \nby EPA to resolve this issue, how much additional research or action \nbeyond that initiated by EPA would cost, and how much Congress thinks \nis appropriate to pay.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, the Senate today is considering legislation \nthat is of primary importance to every home in America. Every \nindividual, every family, and every community is directly affected by \nthe quality of their drinking water. Perhaps in no other area do we \nneed to provide assurances of adequate protection to public health than \nin drinking water. This legislation enhances important public health \npriorities by using sound science and appropriate treatment and testing \ntechnologies.\n  As a cosponsor of the legislation, I would like to commend Senator \nKempthorne and Senator Chafee for what turned out to be a year-long \ndebate over the specifics of this bill. It is, as others have pointed \nout, compromise legislation. I am disappointed that some sections of \nthe bill are not stronger. However, this legislation sets important new \ndirections for Federal policy by providing States and local governments \nwith a much stronger say in dealing with their own particular drinking \nwater issues. Specifically, the new variance section provided to small \nsystems will be of significant assistance in addressing the economic \nconstraints on many of these smaller communities. It is important to \nnote that States decide the affordability criteria, making these \ndecisions closer to home.\n  I am pleased that the standard setting section of the bill includes a \nrequirement that EPA conduct a cost benefit analysis of alternative \nstandards. However, this legislation specifically states only that it \nallows EPA to consider cost and benefits to set new standards; EPA is \nnot clearly required to use that analysis to ensure that benefits \njustify costs.\n  During the regulatory reform debate, we heard from representatives of \nthe administration that such reform was unnecessary. If there were \nproblems with individual statutes--like the current safe drinking water \nlaw--they should be addressed individually, statute by statute. We were \ntold that the President's executive order currently calls cost-benefit \nanalysis and is used to make sure that benefits outweigh costs.\n  Therefore, passage of this Safe Drinking Water Act sets forth an \nimportant test for EPA. Let's see how this bill is implemented. If the \nadministration actually conducts cost-benefit analysis and uses the \nresults, this will go a long way toward passing the test. This statute, \nby allowing EPA the flexibility to conduct a cost-benefit test, will \ndetermine how serious it is about meeting this goal.\n  In this regard, I am disappointed that the cost benefit language is \nnot available for use in the disinfection byproducts rule. I understand \nthat this was a closely negotiated compromise among the various parties \nassociated with this bill. While I respect the compromises that have \nbeen made, I do not believe that the unfortunate results of codifying \nthis proposed rule should be overlooked. EPA has received letters of \nconcern from many communities, including Kansas communities, who are \nworried about the impact of this rule. It is ironic that this \nlegislation seeks \n\n[[Page S 17752]]\nto provide more flexibility for States by providing variances to small \ncommunities. Yet on this particular issue, EPA will continue to have \nthe final say. I am concerned that the legislation before us \nessentially codifies a proposed rule which is extremely expensive and \nignores sound science and the potentially adverse substitute risks that \ncould result from overregulation of disinfection byproducts.\n  Taking into consideration these concerns, I will support this bill. A \nstrong bipartisan effort has been made and there is support of the \ncompromises that were achieved in this bill. A great deal of work has \ngone into this legislation. I look forward to further discussions on \nthis bill and how we can move forward to assure the quality of our \nNation's drinking water.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Coats). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I rise today in support of S. 1316, the \nSafe Drinking Water Act Amendments of 1995, introduced by the Senator \nfrom Idaho, Senator Kempthorne. I am pleased to be an original \ncosponsor of this important legislation. The bill introduced by the \ndistinguished chairman of the Subcommittee on Drinking Water, \nFisheries, and Wildlife will provide the Nation with a more workable, \nrational, and flexible law that reduces the burdens placed on small, \nrural water systems while protecting public health and assuring a safe \nsupply of drinking water.\n  The Safe Drinking Water Act has been one of the most frequently \nmentioned examples of an unfunded mandate on America's small towns, and \njustifiably so. The Congressional Budget Office recently released a \nreport entitled ``The Safe Drinking Water Act: A Case Study of an \nUnfunded Federal Mandate.'' Mr. President, that report documents what \nmany of us already knew about the current law. It is especially \nburdensome on small water systems, such as most of the systems in my \nState. The CBO report states, ``Households served by small water \nsystems are particularly likely to face high costs. Furthermore, \ncompliance costs could increase significantly over time.''\n  Mr. President, it would be one thing if those costs were justified by \na need for safety. But many of these costs have little or nothing to do \nwith safety. In fact, they are regulation for regulation's sake.\n  The Safe Drinking Water Act has also been roundly criticized as \nunnecessarily inflexible. The CBO report also addressed the flexibility \nconcern, indicating that there are significant barriers to adequately \nusing the flexibility provisions in the existing law. Mr. President, we \ncan instill flexibility for our small communities into the Safe \nDrinking Water Act, and still ensure that our constituents are drinking \nsafe, clean water. I believe the bill before us today inserts some \nmuch-needed common sense into the law, and frankly Mr. President, it is \nlong overdue.\n  But the current law is inflexible in other, unnecessary ways as well. \nFor example, the current statute requires that EPA regulate 25 new \ncontaminants every 3 years, regardless of the overall risk posed by \nthese contaminants. Mr. President, that is absurd. That is unnecessary. \nThat is regulation for regulations sake, and it should be stopped.\n  The bill before us repeals the requirement that the EPA regulate 25 \nnew contaminants every 3 years. Instead, the bill takes a flexible \napproach that requires the Administrator of EPA to develop a list of \nhigh-priority contaminants, and make regulatory decisions about at \nleast five of those contaminants every 5 years. The bill does not \nmandate that EPA regulate additional contaminants on an arbitrary and \ncostly schedule. This legislation takes the commonsense approach that \nsays the EPA must analyze possible threats to public health. If no new \nthreat exists, no regulation is necessary. This provision lets EPA \nconsider risk, rather than simply imposing additional costs on water \nsystems that may or may not increase protection of public health.\n  The bill introduced yesterday includes a number of important \nprovisions to address the shortcomings of the existing Safe Drinking \nWater Act. In addition to addressing the flexibility question, it \nauthorizes a State revolving fund to give States funding to make grants \nor loans to water systems to help them comply with the Safe Drinking \nWater Act. In fact, the conference report for the fiscal year 1996 VA, \nHUD, and independent agencies appropriations bill provides $275 million \nfor this SRF, providing we reauthorize the bill. While I would have \npreferred to see more resources go to this vital SRF, this funding is \nessential to small water systems to help them upgrade drinking water \ntreatment systems, replace wells that provide unsafe drinking water, \ndevelop alternative sources of water, and comply with drinking water \nregulations. This funding will also help provide important technical \nassistance to local communities.\n  Let me just say that the local communities have told me over and over \nhow valuable that technical assistance is. I am pleased to say it is \npart of this new legislation.\n  The State Revolving Fund is absolutely essential to our small \ncommunities so that they can adequately protect the health of the \nAmerican public. The bill before us today gives a great deal of \nflexibility to small water systems so they can provide safe and \naffordable drinking water to their consumers. It gives States \nflexibility to reduce monitoring for contaminants that do not occur in \ntheir water system. That just makes common sense. States can also \napprove alternative treatment plans for small systems, taking into \naccount affordability, without compromising the safety of the drinking \nwater supplies.\n  Last year, this body passed a balanced, flexible and workable bill to \nreform the Safe Drinking Water Act. I supported that bill. I was proud \nto do so. Unfortunately, we simply ran out of time at the end of the \nsession before a conference committee could reconcile the differences \nbetween the House and Senate versions of the bill. I was extremely \ndisappointed we could not pass a final version last year.\n  I wish to applaud Senator Kempthorne for the significant effort he \nhas put forward to craft a reasonable and responsible bill, and I \ncommend him for his willingness to work with our colleagues on both \nsides of the aisle in drafting this legislation.\n  Many people from State health department officials to managers of \nsmall rural water systems in my State have told me they believe this \nbill is even better than the bill we were addressing last year. I am \nproud to join the majority leader, the minority leader, the chairman \nand ranking members of the Environment Committee and the drinking water \nsubcommittee in sponsoring this important piece of legislation.\n  What could be more clear than the current legislation, the Safe \nDrinking Water Act, needs to be reformed. It is my hope that this bill \nwill lead to the kind of flexible, workable solutions that have been \nneeded for years. I urge my colleagues to support this commonsense \nlegislation, and I urge our colleagues in the House to quickly turn to \nreforming the Safe Drinking Water Act. We cannot afford to let this \nopportunity slip away again during this session of Congress.\n  I thank the Chair, and I especially thank my colleague from Idaho for \nreally an excellent job in putting this legislation together.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Craig). The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, let me thank my colleague from North \nDakota for the comments he has made in his statement. I greatly \nappreciate both the tone and the spirit and the points the Senator \nraised. I agree with the Senator. The existing Safe Drinking Water Act \nneeds a healthy dose of common sense, as the Senator points out, and I \nbelieve that this bill, S. 1316, provides that common sense. That is \nwhy I believe we have the support of the Governors, the mayors, and the \ncounty commissioners of the Nation supporting us in this legislation. I \nam \n\n[[Page S 17753]]\nproud that the Senator is a cosponsor of this legislation.\n\n  The Senator also pointed out with regard to the funds--and the \nSenator is correct--that up until the passage of this bill, which we \nare looking forward to, we have never provided the funds to the \ncommunities, to the water systems, and ironically we have had the \nsituation where the appropriators have appropriated the money but it \nhas never been authorized. For the first time, we will authorize the \nfunds and use them where they ought to be on a priority basis to help \nour communities ensure that we not only continue to have safe drinking \nwater but it will improve the public health of this country, plus the \ntechnical assistance that the Senator pointed out to the small \ncommunities. They have, as we all do, such finite resources, and yet \nthey want to comply and they want to ensure that their constituents or \nthe customers that they are serving get the standards to the greatest \nextent possible. We provide the technical assistance to do so.\n  Another point that I would just mention is source water protection. I \nthink we owe a great deal of credit to our agricultural organizations \nthroughout the country that really have come forward and said we are \ngoing to support you in this because, again, in the previous Safe \nDrinking Water Acts we never addressed source water protection.\n  So what is this source water protection? Again, it is common sense, \nas the Senator from North Dakota has pointed out, that is, if you can \nkeep water upstream from being contaminated so that you do not then \nhave to wait until it is downstream and then treat all of the \ncontamination so that people can then drink it. It is a lot cheaper to \ngo ahead upstream and put in a few little amenities that may prevent \nthe contamination than to just simply turn your back on it and say, \nwell, we will wait and see what happens down here. But it is voluntary.\n  And so again, it is a progressive step forward, but we have all of \nthe stakeholders upstream saying, wonderful; we will be willing \npartners in making this happen.\n  I believe this legislation, which is very much bipartisan, shows that \nyou can be creative and innovative in protecting the environment but \ndoing it at the most economically feasible level. We say in this \nlegislation just because you can do something technologically does not \nmean it will be justifiable. Now we have cost-benefit.\n  So, again, I thank the Senator from North Dakota. It has been a \npleasure to work with the Senator on this legislation.\n\n  Mr. CONRAD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I again thank my colleague from Idaho. It has been a \npleasure to work with him. He has been open-minded and absolutely fair \nwith respect to listening to both sides on this matter, and I really \nhave appreciated the way he has addressed this matter.\n  I can remember so well going to a meeting of county commissioners and \nmayors in my State, and them saying to me, you know, it is nuts; we are \nbeing asked to test for things that have never been present in our \nsystem for 20 years. We have had testing for 20 years. We have never \nhad this contaminant show up, and we keep having to do tests that may \ncost us $20 or $40 a test every month.\n  When you are talking Washington talk, $20 or $40 a month does not \nsound like very much, but if you have towns such as we have in North \nDakota, we have four of them incorporated that have 10 people or less \nand when you are talking about $20 or $40 a test on things that are \ntotally unnecessary that may have to be done on a quarterly or monthly \nbasis, it mounts up and it becomes an absurdity.\n  So again, I think it is absolutely time that this job gets done. I \nagain wish to thank my colleague from Idaho for the job he has done.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor. I note the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The absence of a quorum has been noted. The \nclerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Coats). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the Safe Drinking \nWater Amendments Act of 1995. I am particularly pleased to see this \nlegislation come before the Senate after the disappointment of last \nyear when we were unable to come to an agreement.\n  I have been involved in this debate for a long time. Back in January \nof this year I wrote a letter to the chairman of the Environment and \nPublic Works Committee, Senator Chafee, urging the Senator to focus the \ncommittee's attention once again on this important piece of \nlegislation. I thought we had a good bill last year. But, Mr. \nPresident, I believe this year's bill is even better. And I thank \nSenator Chafee and others associated with him for their efforts.\n  This year we are able to craft a bipartisan bill which improves our \nNation's drinking water law in several important and meaningful ways. \nCommunities throughout the United States, including many in Nebraska, \nhave had a difficult time complying with current law. As we all know, \nunnecessary and heavy-handed mandates have cost our Nation, especially \nthe small communities, very dearly.\n  This bill recognizes that the needs of small communities are \ndifferent from those of large communities. The bill combines \nflexibility with a good dose of common sense by allowing smaller \ncommunities to find the best way to protect their water quality.\n  This bill gives new authority to the States in determining what \ncontaminants pose the greatest risk to their communities and empowers \nStates to direct their resources toward monitoring those contaminants \nrather than those that pose a trivial risk to their communities, \nremoves excessive Federal regulation and keeps our Nation's drinking \nwater safe.\n  I am proud of the work that Senator Kerrey and I and others have done \non this legislation. I believe that the bill that we have crafted \nstrikes a fair balance by recognizing the need to protect our drinking \nwater but also allowing States flexibility in determining how best to \nprotect this valuable and very vital resource.\n  Mr. President, in closing, I wish to emphasize once again my thanks \nfor the leadership of Senator Chafee and others associated with him on \nthe committee for their very successful job. And I hope that the Safe \nDrinking Water Amendments Act of 1995 will shortly become the law of \nthe land. I thank the Chair and I yield the floor.\n\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Nebraska for \nhis comments. I know that from his perspective, as a former Governor, a \nGovernor from the great State of Nebraska, he realizes the need for \nState flexibility, and by granting that flexibility and authority to \nthe States, that not all wisdom resides in Washington, DC, but that we \nhappen to have 50 Governors throughout this country who really can make \ndecisions that are tailored to the needs of their respective States in \nconjunction with their legislatures and the agencies they have set up \nin place.\n  And, too, Senator Exon referenced Senator Kerrey, whom I also want to \napplaud for his efforts, because really he was a catalyst toward \nassuring that this particular legislation would be bipartisan, as it \nshould be. So, again, the team from Nebraska served well, and I \nappreciate it. It is a joy to work with the Senator.\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, I thank very much my colleague from Idaho. I \nthank him for his keen perception in this whole area. I was very proud \nto follow his leadership earlier this year in the mandates area where \nwe had required that of States for far too long. But I know that he has \nplayed a very keen part in crafting this measure, which I think is fair \nand reasonable, workable, and eliminates much of the consternation and \nexpense, in many cases unnecessarily expensive procedures. So I thank \nhim and the full committee for the excellent job they did. It was a \npleasure working with the Senator.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator \n\n[[Page S 17754]]\n  Snowe of Maine be added as a cosponsor to the legislation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I thank the Chair. I rise in support \nof this legislation to authorize the Safe Drinking Water Act. I want to \ncommend my colleague and my friend from Idaho for his hard work on \nthis, and to express at the same time my appreciation to the chairman \nof the Environment and Public Works Committee, on which we both serve, \nSenator Chafee, for the open process that he and Senator Kempthorne \nestablished for drafting this bill.\n\n  It has not been a lightning experience, though it has been an \nenlightening experience. I say it has not been lightning because it has \ntaken a fair amount of time to get this to this point. As a matter of \nfact, the committee has been meeting since February, both Democrats and \nRepublicans, to try to get this legislation into shape so that it could \nmeet the bipartisan test and pass. They have been meeting almost \nconstantly over the year, and into September and October, to reach the \nconsensus that exists now on this legislation.\n  The process has produced a bill that, though imperfect, does \nsubstantially improve the Safe Drinking Water Act. When I say, ``though \nimperfect,'' I do not remember a time when there was a bill that \ninvolved a complicated process that had been produced here that was \nperfect. There is always a point of view that something could be \nbetter. It was often said by a former majority leader, George Mitchell, \nthat the perfect is the enemy of the good. And what we have is we have \na good bill.\n  This committee, Mr. President, the Environment and Public Works \nCommittee, has a good history of working in a bipartisan fashion. The \nenvironmental legislation has been a joint enterprise, going back to at \nleast 1969. This bipartisanship continued when Democrats chaired the \ncommittee from 1969 to 1980 and then through Senator Robert Stafford's \ntenure as chairman in the early 1980's. That spirit continues today, as \ndemonstrated by this bill.\n  The legacy of this process has been a system of environmental \nprotection that, frankly, is a model for the industrial world. More \nimportantly, the process has led to cleaner water, cleaner air, and a \nsafer disposal of waste. It has led to a better world. But that should \nnot be surprising.\n  There has been strong bipartisan support across the country for \neffective environmental standards. Poll after poll shows support not \nonly for EPA but for toughening of standards to protect the air, the \nwater and our land. Although some special interests have taken the \nrecent election results as a repudiation of the environment agenda over \nthe last 25 years, I hope that this bill demonstrates that we, in a \nbipartisan fashion, can make progress, evidenced by this joint, \nbipartisan commitment to protect our environment.\n  Time will tell if an optimistic view will prevail when Congress deals \nwith other environmental issues.\n  Mr. President, in any compromise, especially in this second \ngeneration of environmental statutes, agreement does not please \neveryone. Reaching a consensus requires both sides to accept provisions \nthat they would rather not have. There are provisions in this bill that \nI would like to strengthen and I am sure others might want to weaken. \nHowever, the overall view is that this is a good bill.\n  It is critical to ensure that drinking water is safe. Guaranteeing \nthat safety is an important responsibility of Government, and it cannot \nbe delegated entirely to the States or to the private market. At the \nsame time, some State and local flexibility is essential to ensure \nefficient regulation. This legislation seeks to strike a balance \nbetween the critical need to guarantee public safety and the need to \nprovide for reasonable regulatory flexibility. Once again, not a \nperfect balance, but a definite improvement over current law.\n  For example, we have attempted to add additional cost-benefit and \nrisk-assessment tests before we regulate chemical contaminants. These \ntests will apply to arsenic and sulfates and chlorinated byproducts. \nThey are a reasonable compromise between provisions in the regulatory \nreform proposal and present law.\n  As we debate this legislation, it is important to do what we can to \nstrengthen public confidence in the water supply. Unfortunately, \nAmericans now have little confidence in the safety of their drinking \nwater. They worry about it, for their families. That is one of the \nreasons why 42 million Americans, one out of six, regularly drink \nbottled water. When I was a child, Mr. President--it was not a century \nago, I assure you--I never heard of anybody drinking bottled water. \nSeltzer water or soda water, or something like that, but plain old \nbottled water? Never heard of it and never had the money for it even if \nwe had heard of it.\n  In the Washington area, Safeway or Giant Food stores, generic bottled \nwater--and I am not talking about the highly advertised designer shaped \nbottles--in these places, water costs about $1.35 a gallon. It is 1,000 \npercent more than tap water--1,000 percent.\n  Despite these high costs, sales of nonsparkling bottled water \nincreased 100 percent between 1986 and 1994. To be sure, some people \ndrink bottled water because of the notion it provides. It is kind of a \ncachet of things that people do, but many simply do not trust local \nwater supplies and are willing to pay a stiff premium for alternatives \nto tap water.\n  I personally believe that the tap water provided by public and \nprivate systems in New Jersey, my State, are safe. But given the \nwidespread distrust of our water supplies, it is essential that in our \nderegulatory zeal, we do not further undermine public confidence in tap \nwater.\n  This bill should move us closer to the goal of safe, drinkable water \nat affordable prices. I have been pleased to cosponsor the bill, and I \nurge its support.\n  I add, Mr. President, that an amendment of mine that is included in \nthe bill is there to guarantee the safety of bottled water, because \nthis amendment requires that bottled water meet the same safety \nstandards set for tap water.\n  There is an anomaly out there that tap water is tested rather \nrigorously, and water that is paid for out of one's pocket has not had \nthe same requirements. We want to make them the same. People ought to \nknow simply because it is in a bottle and thought to be pure that there \nshould be a test that applies to this water.\n  The amendment is supported by the International Bottled Water \nAssociation, and it will assure consumers that bottled water is at \nleast as safe as the water they receive at the tap. The public needs to \nknow that all their drinking water is safe, whether it comes out of the \ntap or out of a bottle.\n  So, Mr. President, I am supporting this bill and reserve, however, \nthe right to change my mind if there are amendments offered that do not \nhave direct relationship to the Safe Drinking Water Act changes as we \npropose them. We have heard other subjects being discussed on the \nfloor, and I hope they will not be offered as amendments to this bill.\n  Barring that, I am 100 percent behind it and will do whatever I can \nto help make it turn into law.\n  Once again, I thank my colleague from Idaho for his good, hard work \nwhich he continually shows in the committee and on the floor. We try to \nget things done, as I suggested earlier, in a bipartisan manner. It \nalways is easier when we do, Mr. President. There are a few things that \nare on tap, to use the expression, a few things that we are working on \nin the Environment and Public Works Committee that I hope we will be \nable to use this effort as a model to move along. I have particular \ninterest in Superfund and some other environmental legislation, and we \njust need to get together to make it happen.\n  With that, Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from New Jersey \nfor his comments. I appreciate so much working with Senator Lautenberg \non the committee. I appreciate his cosponsorship of this legislation. \n\n[[Page S 17755]]\n\n  He has pointed out something that I agree with, and that is, \noftentimes, while the motive may have been pure, you have regulations \nor legislation that is nonworkable, that is difficult to achieve, and \nso we have, again, turned our efforts toward establishing a dose of \ncommon sense in this legislation.\n\n  As the Senator from New Jersey said, there are probably amendments he \nwould like to offer that he would feel would strengthen the bill, and \nthere are others who would offer amendments that would weaken the bill.\n  The interesting thing is, his amendment he would determine as \nstrengthening and I would determine as actually weakening, and vice \nversa.\n  So I think we have found that good balance in this legislation, that \nwhile reducing the cost to the States and cities, we are increasing \npublic health. Just because we have the technology to do something and \nit is technologically feasible, does not necessarily mean it is \njustifiable to require the States and cities to do.\n  So we do have in this environmental legislation cost-benefit analysis \nthat is in place. So, again, I have appreciated working with the \nSenator from New Jersey. I thank him for his comments this afternoon. \nIn this fashion, I believe this legislation is going to move forward.\n  With that, Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Gorton). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, we have two items that have been cleared, \nand that can now be adopted.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3071\n\n    (Purpose: To authorize additional criteria for alternatives to \n                              filtration)\n\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, the first item was brought to our \nattention by the Presiding Officer, Senator Gorton, and Senator Murray. \nThe Safe Drinking Water Act requires filtration for most drinking water \nsystems that are served by surface water. But some cities have made \nextraordinary efforts to protect their watersheds from development that \nmight contribute to contamination. One such city is Seattle, WA. That \ncity owns virtually all of the land around its reservoir. This \namendment recognizes the efforts made by the city of Seattle and allows \nSeattle, in cooperation with the State of Washington, to employ \ntreatment approaches in lieu of filtration that will be more cost \neffective.\n  So, Mr. President, I send on behalf of myself and both Senators from \nWashington a printed amendment, and I ask for its immediate \nconsideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Rhode Island (Mr. Chafee), for himself, \n     Mr. Gorton, Mrs. Murray, Mr. Kempthorne, Mr. Baucus, and Mr. \n     Reid, proposes an amendment numbered 3071.\n\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 64, after line 5, insert the following:\n       ``(a) Filtration Criteria.--Section 1412(b)(7)(C)(i) is \n     amended by adding at the end thereof the following: ``Not \n     later than 18 months after the date of enactment of the Safe \n     Drinking Water Act Amendments of 1995, the Administrator \n     shall amend the criteria issued under this clause to provide \n     that a State exercising primary enforcement responsibility \n     for public water systems may, on a case-by-case basis, \n     establish treatment requirements as an alternative to \n     filtration in the case of systems having uninhabited, \n     undeveloped watersheds in consolidated ownership, and having \n     control over access to, and activities in, those watersheds, \n     if the State determines (and the Administrator concurs) that \n     the quality of the source water and the alternative treatment \n     requirements established by the State ensure significantly \n     greater removal efficiencies of pathogenic organisms for \n     which national primary drinking water regulations have been \n     promulgated or that are of public health concern than would \n     be achieved by the combination of filtration and chlorine \n     disinfection (in compliance with this paragraph and paragraph \n     (8)).''.\n       On page 64, line 6, strike ``(a)'' and insert ``(b)''.\n       On page 64, line 21, strike ``(b)'' and insert ``(c)''.\n\n Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I am happy to support S. 1316, \namendments to the Safe Drinking Water Act. This legislation will go a \nlong way to help small and large water systems in my State to provide \nsafe, clean, and affordable drinking water to their customers.\n  Last year, the Senate considered legislation to amend the Safe \nDrinking Water Act. I was a strong supporter of that legislation, \nwhich, unfortunately, never made it to the President's desk. The bill \nbefore the Senate today improves upon last year's legislation, and I am \nproud to support the committee's legislation once again.\n  Over the past several years I have heard from small and large water \nsystems in my State urging Congress to amend the current law in order \nto break free of the one-size-fits-all approach of current law. The \nlegislation before the Senate today accomplishes this goal. Washington \nState ranks fifth in the Nation in the number of small public water \nsystems, and, as a result, the mandates of current law are especially \nburdensome on my State's small systems. For many of my State's small \ncommunities the price tag associated with filtration costs is \nincomprehensible. These communities simply cannot afford this costly \ntechnology.\n  The legislation before us today ensures that small systems will be \nbetter able to provide safe drinking water to their customers. The bill \ndirects the Administrator to identify a range of technologies for a \nrange of small systems. The legislation recognizes that small systems \nhave unique needs and cannot afford the costly technology that is \naffordable for larger systems. In addition, many of my State's small \nsystem operators have told me that monitoring compliance was one of the \nmost costly aspects of the current law. By giving States with primary \nenforcement responsibility the opportunity to establish their own \nmonitoring requirements, this legislation eliminates another costly \nburden for small systems.\n  The legislation also makes a critical improvement over existing law \non standard setting. The bill establishes that maximum contaminant \nlevel goals [MCLG] for contaminants that are known or likely to cause \ncancer in humans may be set at a level other than zero, if the \nAdministrator determines based upon available, peer-reviewed science, \nthat there is a threshold level below which there is unlikely to be any \nincrease in cancer risk and the Administrator sets the MCLG at that \nlevel with an adequate margin of safety. MCLG's for carcinogens--\nelements known to cause cancer--are set at zero under current law. Many \nin the scientific community believe that this number has been set \narbitrarily. The setting of the standard at zero is the equivalent of \nthe Delany clause for drinking water contaminants. Many communities in \nmy State have argued that a MCLG set at zero is an ineffective use of \nfunds, and results in a great deal of effort expended, in many cases, \nfor a marginal reduction in the likelihood of cancer. By granting the \nAdministrator the flexibility to establish a MCLG at a level other than \nzero, S. 1316 makes a good improvement to existing law.\n  Mr. President, I would also like to thank the chairman and ranking \nmember of the Environment and Public Works Committee, and their staff, \nfor accepting an amendment to the bill offered by this Senator and the \njunior Senator from Washington. The amendment establishes a limited \nalternative to filtration, if the system can utilize another form of \ntreatment that will provide a significantly greater removal of \npathogens, than that of filtration.\n  The need for this amendment was brought to my attention by the city \nof Seattle. The city has two water supply sources, the Cedar River \nWatershed, and the Tolt River supply. Because of turbidity problems in \nthe Tolt supply, the city is in the process of implementing filtration \ntechnology on the Tolt. Conversely, the Cedar River supply does not \nhave turbidity problems--it consistently tests below average for \nturbidity--and the city is seeking an alternative to filtration for the \nCedar River supply.\n  Currently the Cedar is an unfiltered system, and therefore must \ncomply with the surface water treatment rule. The rule sets forward 11 \nspecific criteria, and calls for extensive monitoring of the system, to \nensure that the \n\n[[Page S 17756]]\nsystem continues to provide clean water to its customers. During 1992, \nthe Cedar violated 1 of the 11 criteria, and, consequently, was \nrequired to initiate filtration plans. Shortly thereafter the city \nentered into an agreement with the State and EPA region 10 to achieve \ncompliance with the rule without filtration.\n  Seattle has been working closely with EPA region 10 and the \nWashington State Health Department for the past several years to find a \nway to treat the Cedar supply, without filtration. Filtration would \ncost the city roughly $200 million, but the city believes that the \nprocess of ozonation would better meet the city's drinking water needs. \nThe ozonation process would only cost $68 million. Ozonation is a \nprocess that is considerably less expensive than filtration and is \nbelieved to be the next up and coming technology for ensuring clean \ndrinking water.\n  The ozonation process is proven to be more effective than filtration \nin getting rid of harmful pathogens in a water supply, like \ncryptosporidium and giardia. Filtration technology would inactivate \n99.9 percent of crypto- sporidium, but ozonation would inactivate \n99.999 percent of the crypto- sporidium. The increase of .099 is \nconsidered a significant increase in the level of human health \nprotection.\n  The city of Seattle--together with mayors from Tacoma, Redmond, \nBothell, and Bellevue--support the amendment because the majority of \ntheir communities are served by the Seattle water system. On behalf of \nthe Puget Sound residents served by the city of Seattle's water supply, \nI would like to thank Senators Chafee and Baucus, and their staff, for \nworking on this amendment.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the committee's bill, and this \nSenator hopes that we can get legislation to the President's desk for \nhis signature this year.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If there is no further debate, the question is \non agreeing to the amendment of the Senator from Washington.\n  The amendment (No. 3071) was agreed to.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote by which the \namendment was agreed to, and I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I have a request from Senator Snowe that \nshe be added as a cosponsor of S. 1316 and as a cosponsor of the \nmanagers' amendment to S. 1316.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I ask that Senator Gorton also be added as \ncosponsor of S. 1316 and the managers' amendment thereto.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3072\n\n  (Purpose: To authorize grants for wastewater treatment and drinking \n     water supply to communities commonly referred to as colonias)\n\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, on behalf of myself and Senators Domenici, \nKempthorne, Baucus, and Reid, I send an amendment to the desk and ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Rhode Island (Mr. Chafee), for himself, \n     Mr. Kempthorne, Mr. Baucus, Mr. Domenici, and Mr. Reid, \n     proposes an amendment numbered 3072.\n       On page 195, after line 20, insert the following: ``(h) \n     Assistance to Colonias.--\n       ``(1) Definitions.--As used in this subsection--\n       ``(A) Eligible community.--The term `eligible community' \n     means a low-income community with economic hardship that--\n       ``(i) is commonly referred to as a colonia;\n       ``(ii) is located along the United States-Mexico border \n     (generally in an unincorporated area); and\n       ``(iii) lacks basic sanitation facilities such as a safe \n     drinking water supply, household plumbing, and a proper \n     sewage disposal system.\n       ``(B) Border state.--The term `border State' means Arizona, \n     California, New Mexico and Texas.\n       ``(C) Treatment works.--The term `treatment works' has the \n     meaning provided in section 212(2) of the Federal Water \n     Pollution Control Act (33 U.S.C. 1292(2)).\n       ``(2) Grants to alleviate health risks.--The Administrator \n     of the environmental Protection Agency and the heads of other \n     appropriate Federal agencies are authorized to award grants \n     to any appropriate entity or border State to provide \n     assistance to eligible communities for--\n       ``(A) the conservation, development, use and control \n     (including the extension or improvement of a water \n     distribution system) of water for the purpose of supplying \n     drinking water; and\n       ``(B) the construction or improvement of sewers and \n     treatment works for wastewater treatment.\n       ``(3) Use of funds.--Each grant awarded pursuant to \n     paragraph (2) shall be used to provide assistance to one or \n     more eligible community with respect to which the residents \n     are subject to a significant health risk (as determined by \n     the Administrator or the head of the Federal agency making \n     the grant) attributable to the lack of access to an adequate \n     and affordable drinking water supply system or treatment \n     works for wastewater.\n       ``(4) Operation and maintenance.--The Administrator and the \n     heads of other appropriate Federal agencies, other entities \n     or border States are authorized to use funds appropriated \n     pursuant to this subsection to operate and maintain a \n     treatment works or other project that is constructed with \n     funds made available pursuant to this subsection.\n       ``(5) Plans and specifications.--Each treatment works or \n     other project that is funded by a grant awarded pursuant to \n     this subsection shall be constructed in accordance with plans \n     and specifications approved by the Administrator, the head of \n     the Federal agency making the grant, or the border State in \n     which the eligible community is located. The standards for \n     construction applicable to a treatment works or other project \n     eligible for assistance under title II of the Federal Water \n     Pollution Control Act (33 U.S.C. 1281 et seq.) shall apply to \n     the construction of a treatment works or project under this \n     subsection in the same manner as the standards apply under \n     such title.\n       ``(6) Authorization of appropriations.--there are \n     authorized to be appropriated to carry out this subsection \n     such sums as may be necessary for fiscal years 1996 through \n     2003.''.\n\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, this is an amendment that has been cleared \nby both sides. As you understood from the reading of it, it deals with \nthose very low-income settlements along the United States side of the \nUnited States-Mexican border, and it is of particular concern to the \nsenior Senator from New Mexico, and I am sure for the junior Senator \nfrom New Mexico likewise.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I rise in strong support of S. 1316, the \nSafe Drinking Water Act Amendments of 1995. I am proud to be an \noriginal cosponsor of this outstanding, broadly bipartisan bill.\n  Mr. President, I have long been involved in the drinking water \ndebate, having introduced a reform bill of my own last session. Coming \nfrom a predominantly rural State, one of my biggest concerns with the \ncurrent Safe Drinking Water Act is the fact that the overwhelming \nmajority of small rural water systems simply do not have the economic \nor technical capability to comply with the act as it now exists. \nSenator Kempthorne's bill goes very far in addressing this problem by \ngiving States the flexibility to grant variances for small water \nsystems.\n  In addition, I am very happy to see that Senator Kempthorne's bill \nrequires EPA to use the best available, peer-reviewed science in \nimplementing the act. I worked hard to get this commonsense provision \nput into last session's reauthorization effort, and I am glad it has \nbeen retained in this session's bill.\n  I would like to take a few moments to discuss an issue of particular \nimportance to me, and that is the issue of colonias. Mr. President, for \nthose who do not speak Spanish or come from the Southwest, colonia is \nthe Spanish word for neighborhood. Traditionally, in my State of New \nMexico and throughout the Southwest, colonias referred to long-\nestablished, unincorporated small towns with rich community heritages.\n  Over the past decade, colonias have also come to refer to densely \npopulated, poverty-stricken communities that have sprung up along the \nborder in the past 10 to 15 years. They are often populated primarily \nby Mexican-Americans and legal immigrants working as seasonal farm \nlaborers. These are decent, honest, hardworking people trying their \nbest to create a good life for themselves and their families. The \ntragedy of these new colonias, however, is that they are typified by \ndesperate poverty, by severe overcrowding, by inadequate housing, by \npathetic roads, and, most important for purposes of the bill before us, \nby nonexistent drinking and waste water services.\n\n[[Page S 17757]]\n\n  Mr. President, I would like to read a few passages from an article \nthat appeared earlier this year in one of my State's newspapers, the \nLas Cruces Sun News. Las Cruces is the largest city in Dona Ana County, \na county with a large number of colonias. The article, written by \nDeborah Baker of the Associated Press, is titled ``Colonias: The \nAmerican dream is more of a nightmare for many State residents.'' Mr. \nPresident, the passages I would like to read, which could apply to most \nof the new colonias dotting our Nation's southwestern border, describe \nthe appalling conditions under which these people live every day:\n\n       The American dream lives on a trash-strewn hillside at the \n     end of a rutted road in a cluster of trailer and shacks \n     called El Milagro--``The Miracle.''\n       There, two families share three rooms: a two-room trailer, \n     and a dirt-floored addition with walls that stop several feet \n     short of the ceiling.\n       Cooking is done on a grate balanced between cinderblocks \n     over an open fire on the dirt floor. Water comes from a pipe, \n     run from a neighbor's house, that sticks up from the ground \n     behind the trailer. There is no bathroom--not even an \n     outhouse. No electricity. No heat.\n\n  Mr. President, this is a description of third-world living conditions \nexisting here in the United States of America. Such conditions are \nunsafe, unhealthy, and, I believe, simply intolerable. Nor is this a \nsmall problem. I know that in New Mexico we have at least 60 such \ncommunities in desperate need of this basic infrastructure. In Dona Ana \nCounty alone, there are 35 colonias.\n  Our border States have made great efforts in trying to deal with this \nproblem. My State of New Mexico, for example, has spent large amounts \nof money to build community centers, health facilities, fire stations, \nand day care centers for its colonies. New Mexico also recently enacted \na statute to tighten up zoning laws that had previously allowed \ndevelopers to subdivide plots of land repeatedly for residential use \nwithout first supplying basic infrastructure.\n  Unfortunately, however, many of the border States simply do not have \nthe financial capability to help with some of the more costly \ninfrastructure that these communities need, especially drinking water \nand wastewater facilities. The colonias themselves certainly do not \nhave these funds.\n  Consequently, I am offering an amendment, for myself and for Senator \nBingaman, that I believe will greatly help these most needy of \ncommunities.\n  Mr. President, my amendment will authorize the Environmental \nProtection Agency, or any other appropriate agency, to award grants to \nany appropriate entity or border State to provide assistance for the \nconstruction of drinking and wastewater facilities.\n  My amendment also authorizes these agencies to use funds to operate \nand maintain these drinking and wastewater facilities. I believe this \nis a key point. It is not enough just to build these systems. Without \nthe technical assistance to keep them operating, and operating well, we \nhaven't accomplished anything.\n  In closing, Mr. President, I would like to thank Chairman Chafee and \nSenator Kempthorne for their gracious help with this important \namendment. I believe the amendment will go a long way in helping some \nof the neediest communities in the United States in two crucial public \nhealth areas. These colonias will finally get adequate sewer service, \nand they will finally receive clean, safe water to drink.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate on the amendment? If \nnot, the question is on agreeing to the amendment of the Senator from \nRhode Island.\n  The amendment (No. 3072) was agreed to.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, move to reconsider the vote by which the \namendment was agreed to, and I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Chafee). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be \npermitted to speak as in morning business for not to exceed 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, as we are here, I think, close to \ncompleting a very important piece of legislation on safe drinking \nwater, we, as Members of this body, recognize that in another sense we \nare marking time during negotiations between the Republican leadership \nof the House and Senate and the President of the United States on the \nquestion of the balanced budget.\n  There was, just a few weeks ago, a crisis in the course of our \nGovernment as the President vetoed a continuing resolution and thus put \nout of work many hundreds of thousands of Government employees. Crisis \nnegotiations led to a further continuing resolution under which each of \nthe agencies of Government will continue in operation until the 15th of \nDecember while the various parties negotiate a long-term budget.\n  One of the conditions of that return, a part of the law signed by the \nPresident of the United States, was an agreement to reach before the \nend of this session of Congress, that is to say, before the end of the \nyear, a budget which would be projected to be in balance by the year \n2002 under figures and statistics provided by the Congressional Budget \nOffice, so that each of us knew the parameters within which that debate \nwould take place.\n  At the same time as these temporary arrangements were being made, \nthis body and the House of Representatives passed, and is about to send \nto the President of the United States, a bill, the Balanced Budget Act \nof 1995, which accomplished precisely that goal. Many of the elements \nof that proposal are controversial, though it does for the first time \ntruly reform our entitlement programs, including Medicare, Medicare in \na way that preserves its financial security, keeps part A from going \nbankrupt, fairly continues the present percentage of premiums paid by \nthe beneficiaries of part B, and adds to the premiums only of very \nwell-off Americans.\n  The President has announced--and in this case we have no reason to \ndoubt him--that he will veto that Balanced Budget Act of 1995. So far, \nin spite of that announced intention, in spite of his signature \nsolemnly affixed to a bill which calls for just such a balanced budget \nunder just such a set of statistics, the President has submitted no \nalternative budget which would be balanced under those rules by 2002.\n  As a consequence, the negotiations, which began abortively more than \na week ago and seriously just a couple of days ago, have not even \nproduced an agreement on an agenda. This is not surprising. We have \nproduced and sent to the President the Balanced Budget Act of 1995. We \nbelieve that it covers all of the conditions asked for by the \nPresident: that it properly and appropriately funds Medicare, Medicaid, \nwelfare, the national defense, the environment, and a wide range of \nother activities.\n  The President disagrees. That is the President's prerogative. But, \nMr. President, it is not an appropriate response to that disagreement \nto simply sit still and say, ``Give me another alternative.'' The \nPresident has a duty, if he is serious at all about the budget crisis \nfacing this country, to say,\n\n       Here is my proposal for a balanced budget by the year 2002, \n     based on these same propositions. Here are the differences \n     between the two parties. Let us negotiate those differences.\n\n  To this point, every economic indicator since the election of just \nmore than a year ago is in a positive direction. Interest rates are \nlower, inflation is down, employment and the gross domestic product are \nup, based, as we understand, primarily on the proposition that our \nfinancial markets believe that the budget will be balanced.\n  In my opinion, if the President continues to refuse to propose any \nalternative, if he believes that the politics of scare tactics about \nMedicare and other programs are a better election platform on which to \nrun than an actual balanced budget, we will almost certainly suffer a \nloss in each one of \n\n[[Page S 17758]]\nthose economic indicators, which will not help the President--for that \nmatter, will not help the Congress, and certainly will not help the \ncountry.\n  We are bound and determined to have just such a balanced budget. The \nPresident has now, by his signature on a bill, agreed to just such a \nbalanced budget. It is time--it is well past time--that the President, \nwho so eloquently disagrees with ours, produces his own so that we can \nwork constructively toward a solution.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, yesterday when I was on the floor I made \nsome comments which I do not think were very clearly understood because \nI was assuming some people were aware of some of the problems that have \nexisted since the initialing of the peace agreement in Bosnia.\n  It has been very disturbing to me, after having been over there, to \nfeel that most people are laboring under the misconception that there \nis in fact a peace. The President himself in his message to the Nation \nsaid, ``Now the war is over.'' I just wish the President would go over \nthere and see that the war is not over.\n  But since that time, there have been some articles which I would like \nto read, and then submit into the Record. One is from the Los Angeles \nTimes of November 25, just a few days ago.\n  ``On Friday, November 24, approximately 200 Bosnian Government troops \nlooted a U.N. base in the Bihac''--that is right over here, Mr. \nPresident, on the Croatian border--``manned by a Bangladeshi battalion. \nThey fired machine guns over the heads of the peacekeepers and carried \noff food, fuel, and equipment including nine armored vehicles. The 80 \npeacekeepers returned fire''--keep in mind that while all of this is \nhappening they are firing and returning fire--``but were forced to \nretreat. The Bosnians were taking advantage of the imminent withdrawal \nof U.N. forces to make way for NATO troops''--which gives you an \nindication as to what would happen even if we were able to stop this \nobsession that the President of the United States has in sending troops \ninto Bosnia and were able to try to get them withdrawn.\n  Also, a Reuters publication on the same day, on Friday, the 24th, \nsays, ``Also on Friday the 24th, U.N. officials reported that Croat \nforces burned and looted houses''--these are Croat forces--``in areas \nlocated in central and northwest Bosnia. Houses were burned and looted \nin the city of Gornji Vakuf''--which is this area right in here--``in \ncentral Bosnia and also in the cities of Mrkonjic Grad, and Sipovo''--\nwhich is this area right in here.\n  If you look, the major part of the activity is taking place in this \nsection right of Bosnia. This is the section in which the United States \nwould have forces.\n  I have often wondered, and have not been able to get an answer from \nanyone, as to who drew these lots for us; why we have the French over \nhere and the British over here, but we would be right here--virtually \neverything north of Sarajevo up to and including Tuzla, and a corridor \nthat would go through here, which is one of the most contentious areas.\n  This comes from the New York Times article of the 27th: ``On Sunday, \nNovember 26, angry groups of men stoned and flipped over U.N. vehicles \npassing through Serbian sections of Sarajevo.''\n  Sarajevo is an area that is divided up between Croats, Serbs, and \nMoslem forces, each with their own checkpoints.\n  Also according to the New York Times: ``As of November 26, a total of \n210 peacekeepers have been killed in the 4 years of conflict in the \nformer Yugoslavia.''\n  Mr. President, these are identified as peacekeepers. If you will \nremember, one of the major concerns that we have is that the President \nis putting our forces into a situation that is ideal for what we call \n``mission creep.'' That is, you go in with one idea. Say you are going \nto go in, as we are going in, to keep the peace. Obviously, there is no \npeace to keep. But still they call them ``peacekeepers.''\n  When the President made his speech he was very careful to use the \nword ``implementation.''\n  So it has already crept from peacekeeping to peace \n``implementation.''\n  The Times article goes on: ``In Bosnia itself, 107 have been killed, \nmost by the former Serbs but some by the Muslims. Serbs have repeatedly \nused peacekeepers as hostages to secure their aims.''\n  Further, in the same article: ``In the past NATO has been able to \nrespond to attacks on peacekeepers with air strikes on Serbian \nartillery and other positions. Now this is less of an option because \nthe multinational troops will be mingled with the civilian population \nespecially in places like Sarajevo, where about 10,000 troops are to be \ndeployed.''\n  ``The NATO operation is billed as one where superior Western \nfirepower will obliterate any obstacles. But the NATO led force will \nnot be threatened mainly by organized resistance, but by angry women \nand children, lone snipers and renegade bands of armed men determined \nto thwart a plan that would drive them from their homes and negate all \nthey have fought to achieve.''\n  We are talking about people who have fought each other for nearly 4 \nyears. And I stood on the streets of Sarajevo and saw those areas where \nthey have pounded the residential areas and have obliterated them. Many \nof the people who are there now are not the people who lived in \nSarajevo before. They were not there back during the Winter Olympics \nthat we remember so fondly in such a beautiful thriving city as \nSarajevo then was. They are people who came in there as refugees. Once \nthe people were driven from their homes, they were no longer livable \nfor individuals who had those homes, and now refugees have come in.\n  So we are dealing now with two groups of people that are going to be \nproblems--assuming that we are successful in going in there to achieve \nsome type of peace.\n  Col. Thierry Cambournac of NATO, deputy sector commander of Sarajevo, \nsaid he feared that the soldiers could get drawn into conflicts in \nurban areas \n\n[[Page S 17759]]\nthey will patrol. A quote from the colonel: ``Our biggest concern is \nthe population in these areas will revolt.''\n  Their concern is not whether one of the organized factions, whether \nit is Croats or Serbs or the Moslems, are going to be a problem. It is \ninstead the people who have been driven from their homes. In fact, the \nmayor of this suburb said, and this is a direct quote, ``We will still \nfight, and if the multinational force tries to drive us from our homes, \nor take away our right to defend ourselves, there will be no authority \non Earth''--no authority on Earth--``including the Serbian authorities, \nthat can stop us. We will not leave, we will not withdraw, and we will \nnot live under Muslim rule.''\n  Now, we get back to the two groups of people, the groups of people \nthat have fought for homes. And what does that mean when they have a \npeace? They assume they can continue to live in their homes. But, no, \nthat is not the way this works because if they happen to be a Serbian \nfamily in a home that is now designated by this group that met in Ohio \nas a Croatian area, then they will be driven from their homes.\n  I used to be the mayor of a major city in America, Tulsa, OK. You do \nnot make statements like this unless you mean it. He says we will not \nleave. So we now have a new faction, rogue faction if you will, that \nwill develop from people who are living in homes, fought for homes they \nfeel are theirs now, and now we come along and say, ``You have to \nmove.''\n  What is the other group? We hear about 2 million refugees that are \nscattered all throughout this region. I think it is closer to 3 \nmillion. When I was over there, they were identifying close to 3 \nmillion refugees, but let us be conservative and say 2 million \nrefugees. These are people who have been driven from their homes--a \nsecond group of people. These people were driven from their homes. When \nthey hear there is a peace accord, what does that mean to a refugee? It \nmeans he can go home.\n  So what happens to those people? Are they Serbs? Are they Bosnian \nSerbs? Are they Moslems? Are they Croats? We do not know. And it does \nnot really matter what they are because they are going to become rogue \nelements. Our intelligence community has already identified nine rogue \nelements. We have the Iranians; the mujaheddin; we know they are in \nthere right now; we have the Black Swans which are mostly Moslems; we \nhave the Arkan Tigers; we have special forces.\n  So, Mr. President, we are not dealing with three people sitting \naround a table in Dayton, OH, agreeing about what they are going to do. \nI seriously doubt that the star of that show, the one who was supposed \nto be the most difficult to swing into a peace posture, Milosevic, is \nreally speaking on behalf of those Serbs in Bosnia because those people \nare considered Bosnian Serbs, and they consider themselves to be \nindependent.\n  When I was in Sarajevo, there is a little town located right here \ncalled Pale. This is the town where they supposedly had the Christian \nScience Monitor journalist who had been held hostage for a period of \ntime, and we were getting ready to go over there to help bring him back \nwhen we found out in fact he was not there. But one thing we did learn \nis that when you close those checkpoints, you are in another world, and \nthose people do not have their allegiance to Milosevic. They do not \nhave their allegiance to Tudjman or in many cases even Karadzic because \nthey are people who are now holding themselves out to be independent.\n  So I would just repeat to the President, who in his speech said the \nwords ``the war isn't over,'' I have yet to find--there are only two \nMembers of Congress, to my knowledge, who have been up into this \nnortheast sector, the sector where the President is proposing to send--\nand as we are speaking today is sending--American troops on the ground. \nThey are Senator Hank Brown from Colorado and myself.\n  Yesterday, we had a chance to address the Senate about what has \nreally happened up there. It is not very pretty. In fact, we went via \nBritish helicopter, at very low attitude, never getting over 1000 feet, \nin a blizzard, all the way from Sarajevo up to the Tuzla area, going \nback and forth, and really being able to look very carefully at all of \nthis land.\n  Everything between Sarajevo and Tuzla is not like the Rocky \nMountains, not like we think of mountainous regions. It is straight up \nand down. There is no way you could have even any kind of a light \narmored vehicle penetrate and travel through those roads, leave alone \n120 M1 tanks they are talking about bringing from Hungary, down across \nthe Posavina corridor and into the Tuzla area. Once they go into the \nTuzla area, the terrain will not allow them to go any further.\n  We have seen articles, many of which I have here, published recently \nabout the mines, about the roads. They talk about the roads coming down \nfrom Hungary into the Tuzla area where 120 M1 tanks--there is only one \nbridge in the entire area that is going to be able to hold up an M1 \ntank. Up in Tuzla, General Haukland, a Norwegian general who was in \ncharge up there, said that another element that you are going to have \nhostile are the very people we are supposedly trying to protect and \ntrying to achieve peace for. Those are the individuals who will be mad \nbecause we have torn the roads up, the same roads they need for \ncommerce and freedom of movement.\n  I have never seen a proposed mission as doomed for failure as this \none. We do not know who the enemy is. We are dealing with the mentality \nof people who fire on their own troops, murder their own people so they \ncan blame somebody else. I do not know why anyone would not come to the \nconclusion that, if you are going to fire on your own troops so you can \nblame some other faction, you would certainly fire on American troops \ntrying to remove you from your home.\n  It is my understanding--from the sketchy information we get from the \nagreement that has been initialed--that there are two conditions under \nwhich we will withdraw our troops. One is at the end of 12 months.\n  Now, since I have not heard anything to the contrary since the Senate \nArmed Services Committee met, when we had Secretary Christopher and \nSecretary Perry and General Shalikashvili, the Chairman of the Joint \nChiefs of Staff, all said that in 12 months we will be out of there. \nAnd I asked the question, you mean we are going to be out of there \nregardless? If we are in the middle of a huge war, if we have \nentrenched ourselves within the civil war that has been going on for \n500 years, we are about to win it, and that 12 months is over, we \nwithdraw? Absolutely, they said, we are going to withdraw in 12 months, \nand it is over.\n  I do not think there is anyone who has studied military history who \ncan point to a time when we have had a time deadline as to when a \nwithdrawal will take place. It is supposed to be event-oriented: After \nthis happens and this happens and we are successful, then we will \nwithdraw. That is not what we are saying. We are saying we will \nwithdraw in 12 months.\n  The other condition is withdrawal in the event of ``systemic \nviolations.''\n  Mr. President, I have asked for many times a definition of ``systemic \nviolation.'' What is a systemic violation? The administration speaks in \nvague terms about this. They say if you take the Croats or take the \nSerbs or take the Moslems as the three major factions, and if it is \nobvious that one faction is going to break the peace accord that we \nassume is going to be signed and is going to be acknowledged, then that \nwould constitute a systemic violation.\n  Well, we already know that there are nine or perhaps more rogue \nelements out there. How is our soldier, who has been trained over in \nGermany to fight in this type of terrain, how is this soldier who is \nfired upon going to know whether that firepower is coming from the \nCroats, the Serbs, the Moslems or is coming from some irate families \nwho do not want to leave their homes or from some refugees who want to \ngo home or the Black Swans or the Arkan Tigers or the mujaheddin?\n  This is the problem we have here. Nobody can answer these questions. \nAnd yet systemic violation means we pick up our toys and go home. And \nwhat is going to happen on the road home? The same thing that you are \nseeing over here as we are making a transformation from a U.N. \npeacekeeping operation to a NATO operation that has not been well-\ndefined. They are firing on so-called ``peacekeeping'' troops. And we \nare not really sure who will be firing on our troops. Now, if it \n\n[[Page S 17760]]\ncould happen now during a cease-fire, it certainly can happen later. I \nhave been disturbed for 2 years about this because 2 years ago--and I \ndo not think it served any useful purpose--when I was serving in the \nother body, serving on the House Armed Services Committee, one of the \ntop individuals came in and said that one of the first things that \nPresident Clinton said when he came into office was that he wanted to \ndo airdrops into Bosnia. And I asked the question, in this closed \nmeeting at that time--it is all right to talk about it now--I said, \n``Well, let me ask you a question. They have been fighting over there \nwith all these rogue elements, with all these factions. How do you \nknow, if we are dropping our stuff in there, if it will be in the hands \nof the good guys instead of the bad guys?'' The answer of this official \nwas, ``Well, we don't know.'' Then he hesitated and looked over and \nsaid, ``You know, I'm not sure we know who the good guys and the bad \nguys are.''\n\n  We have clearly taken sides. We are now saying that we are in a peace \nimplementation posture where we are supposed to be neutral. We are \ngoing in with a NATO force that is declared to be neutral, yet we have \ntaken sides clearly against the Serbs. That is where our air attacks \nhave gone. I think it would be very difficult for us to go in and say \nwe are truly neutral in this case.\n  I guess the reason that I am going to continue talking about this for \nas long as we are in session is that each hour that goes by, Mr. \nPresident, we become more in peril. More of our American lives are \nendangered because, as we are speaking today, they are taking the \ntroops--the troops that have been trained and the advanced troops who \nare going in for logistics purposes--and they have already been \ndeployed from Germany up to Hungary, down south toward the Tuzla area \nthat has been assigned to us, having to go through such hostile areas \nas this part of Croatia, this part of Serbia and, of course, the \nPosavina corridor which we already talked about.\n  That means that if it is an hour after this or a day after this, \nthere are going to be several more--how many are there right now? I am \nembarrassed to tell you, Mr. President, I do not know. I am a Member of \nthe U.S. Senate. I am a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee. \nI am a member of the Senate Intelligence Committee, and yet I do not \nknow. And it is a highly guarded secret.\n  We read different articles in the newspapers about how many are over \nthere. We hear calls from people at home that say that they have heard \nfrom their son or daughter who is being deployed or was deployed 2 or 3 \ndays ago. And there is no way of knowing.\n  But we do know this: That the clear strategy of the President of the \nUnited States is to get as many American troops over there as possible \nbefore there is any vote that takes place in this Senate so that he \nwill put us in a position of voting against our troops that are on the \nground, which he knows we do not want to do. And so he is holding us \nhostage in Congress.\n  One thing we have not talked about is the cost of all of this. Talk \nabout being held hostage. We have gone through these humanitarian \ngestures in Sarajevo and Haiti and all the rest of the things that are \npart of President Clinton's foreign policy. And while we do not \nauthorize them, they come around later and say now we have to have an \nemergency supplemental appropriation. We passed one out of this body a \nfew weeks ago for $1.4 billion. And that was for the things that were \ntaking place in Haiti and Somalia. And those were exercises that we \nopposed in a bipartisan way in both the House and the Senate.\n  So I anticipate that if the President is successful, as it appears he \nis going to be--it may be a fait accompli. Maybe it has already \nhappened. Maybe we cannot stop it. So our troops are going to be sent \nout over there, not 20,000, not 25,000; we know it will be closer to \n40,000 or 50,000, at least. Then we will be faced one of these days \nwith a supplemental appropriation request for not $1.5 billion but for, \naccording to the Heritage Foundation and some other groups, somewhere \nbetween $3 billion and $6 billion.\n  It means if we do not then appropriate that in an emergency \nsupplemental appropriation, it is going to come out of the military \nbudget. And we are already operating our military on a budget that is \nof the level of 1980, when we could not afford spare parts.\n  So, Mr. President, I want to impress upon this body that the war is \nnot over over there, that they are killing people today as we speak, \nthat all this hostility is taking place in these areas, along with all \nwe know about in the sector referred to as the northeast U.N. sector \nwhere we will have our troops.\n  I have been up there. I do not think there is one person so far who \nhas been north of Sarajevo and up through Tuzla who says that we should \nsend young American lives into that area. I have never personally seen \nany more hostile area in my life. I have never seen anything that looks \nlike that.\n  There is no way we can use the armored vehicles. And it is very easy \nto understand now, in studying our history of World War II, how the \nformer Yugoslavia was able to, at a ratio of 1 to 8, hold off the very \nfinest that Hitler had because of this very unique area of cliffs and \ncaves, this hostile environment, where the President of the United \nStates is sending our young soldiers.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, the Senator from New York, Senator \nMoynihan, has long been a driving force in attempting to have the \nEnvironmental Protection Agency set its priorities based on good \nscience. He is the author of a bill to accomplish this. That bill was \nthe basis for section 28 in the legislation that we are considering \ntoday.\n  Although we have agreed to drop section 28 from this bill, I want to \nassure the Senator from New York that we will continue to work with him \nand other interested Senators on this matter.\n  Personally, I have agreed with Senator Moynihan that because he was \ngenerous enough and gracious enough to agree to the dropping of section \n28, that as chairman of the Environment and Public Works Committee I \nwill present to the committee section 28 as a freestanding bill. We \nhave agreed we will have a hearing on this, and I will seek to have \nlegislation approved by the committee as quickly as possible.\n  In addition, Senator Johnston has some views on this matter, and we \nwould invite him to testify at that hearing. My goal would be to hold a \nhearing in the next few weeks, and my hope is we could proceed to \nreport a new freestanding bill shortly thereafter.\n  Mr. President, earlier I presented an amendment on behalf of Senator \nDomenici in connection with providing assistance to those villages \nlocated on the United States-Mexican border known as colonias. I ask \nunanimous consent that Senators Kyl and Feinstein be added as original \ncosponsors to Senator Domenici's amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, in the 1994 elections, Americans demanded a \nsmaller, smarter Federal Government and a more rational, cost-effective \nsystem of regulation. While Americans do not want to compromise on \npublic health protection, they do want an assurance that the public \nhealth and environmental protection dollars are being spent wisely. \nThat is why Federal and State Governments must prioritize and target \nscarce resources toward reducing health threats based on actual or \nlikely risks. This concept makes sense and is supported by public \nhealth agencies as well as the scientific community.\n  There are several environmental statutes that, although they were \nenacted with the best of intentions, have been unworkable in their \nimplementation and enforcement--the Safe Drinking Water Act being one \nof them. No one disputes the importance of preserving this public \nhealth statue. However, there are reforms that need to be made. At the \nsame time, this Congress is not here to gut any environmental laws, as \nsome national environmental organizations would have the public \nbelieve--our goal is to make them work more effectively for the benefit \nof all our citizens.\n  When we talk about the issue of unfunded Federal mandates, the Safe \nDrinking Water Act is regarded by many State and local governments as \nthe king of unfunded mandates. It is particularly burdensome on \neconomically distressed communities and those with a small or \ndiminishing tax base.\n  While the issue of Federal mandates is not new, the level of concern \namong municipal governments has risen dramatically in recent years, and \nwith good reason. According to a report by the Congressional Budget \nOffice, the number of Federal mandates is increasing while Federal aid \nto State and local governments for categories other than welfare has \nbeen falling on a per capita basis since 1978. Contributing to the \nmandate burden is the insufficient flexibility in Federal regulations.\n  Last year's Safe Drinking Water bill represented a major improvement \nover existing law, especially through the elimination of the arbitrary \nrequirement that EPA regulate 25 contaminants every 3 years. This \nyear's proposed modifications, however, fine tune the statue's ability \nto achieve congressional objectives of providing more flexibility and \nauthority to State and local governments, lessening the burden of \nFederal mandates and prioritizing resources according to risk--thereby \nachieving greater public health protection.\n  I support the efforts of Senators Kempthorne and Chafee in reaching \nan agreement with other committee members on a Safe Drinking Water \nreform bill. I have been closely involved \n\n[[Page S 17762]]\nin negotiating many of its provisions, including: a more reasonable \nradon standard that will save New England water suppliers and their \nratepayers millions of dollars without compromising public health; and \nthe authorization of five small system water technology centers at \nacademic institutions around the country to assist in developing and \ntesting affordable treatment technologies for small systems. One of \nthese centers I hope will be established at the University of New \nHampshire, which has extensive knowledge and experience in water \ntechnology.\n  So today, Mr. President, I am pleased that the Senate is giving \napproval of these much needed reforms to the Safe Drinking Water Act. \nThis bill received the unanimous support of the Environment and Public \nWorks Committee, of which I am a member, as well as the coalition \nrepresenting State and municipal government and public water supply \ncommunity. I now urge the House to act expeditiously on its \nreauthorization bill so that our communities can soon receive the \nregulatory relief and financial assistance they need.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3076\n\n  (Purpose: To strike the provisions with respect to comparative risk \n                              assessment)\n\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I just referred to the fact that we would \nbe dropping section 28 from the bill in accordance with an agreement \nwith Senator Moynihan and others.\n  I now send to the desk an amendment to accomplish that, and I ask for \nits immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Rhode Island [Mr. Chafee], for himself, \n     Mr. Kempthorne, Mr. Baucus, and Mr. Reid, proposes an \n     amendment numbered 3076.\n       Beginning on page 179, line 16, strike section 28 of the \n     bill and renumber subsequent sections accordingly.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise to acknowledge the 20th anniversary \nof the Individuals With Disabilities Education Act [IDEA].\n  It is important to pause today and recognize the impact that this law \nhas had on the lives of millions of children with disabilities and \ntheir families during the last two decades. Through this law we deliver \non a timeless simple promise--every child with a disability shall have \na free appropriate public education--no more, no less.\n  The Senate Subcommittee on Disability Policy, which I chair, is \ninvolved in the reauthorization of IDEA. As the new chairman of the \nsubcommittee, I wanted to get the facts before we began the \nreauthorization process. The subcommittee held four hearings on the law \nin May and July of this year. The first hearing on May 9, which I \ncochaired with my friend from California, Mr. Cunningham of the other \nbody, was a joint congressional hearing on the 20th anniversary of \nIDEA.\n  During the course of that hearing we heard from Members who were \noriginal cosponsors of the legislation in 1975, judges and attorneys \ninvolved with the landmark court cases that served as catalysts for \nIDEA, and former congressional staff and advocates for children with \ndisabilities, who facilitated its historic passage.\n  That hearing sent a valuable message to students with disabilities, \ntheir families, and educators. Members of Congress have a longstanding \ninterest in assuring a free appropriate public education and early \nintervention services for infants, toddlers, children, and youth with \ndisabilities. Designing and sustaining the Federal role in assisting \nStates with these responsibilities is founded on bipartisan \ncooperation.\n  There are many challenges that face America's young people: What to \nchoose for a life's work, how to evaluate advice, how to judge one's \nown progress, and how to define personal satisfaction and happiness. \nTheir approach to these questions will be colored by the behavior of \nadults around them. Do we celebrate individual abilities and \ndifferences? Do we encourage cooperation and collaboration in school? \nDo we respect and recognize the opinions of young people? Do we promote \ngoal setting based on interests and abilities?\n  How we answer these questions with regard to young people with \ndisabilities is a barometer. If young people with disabilities are \nexposed to the experiences of their peers, if we help them become a \nvalued member of their peer group, if we take into account their \nchoices, and if we help them become the best they can be, they and \ntheir nondisabled friends learn a valuable lesson. They learn that \nadults care, that we are fair, and that we can be trusted.\n  My good friend from Iowa and I released the first draft of the \nauthorization bill for IDEA on November 20. As we developed the draft, \nwe were always conscious of these young people and their future.\n  We have spent many months reading and talking to people about how to \nbest serve children with disabilities through IDEA. Five major \nprinciples influenced our drafting efforts.\n  First, children with disabilities and their families should be the \ncentral focus of our drafting efforts.\n  Second, if a provision in IDEA works, don't undo it.\n  Third, add incentives that encourage schools to serve children, based \non needs, not because of disability labels.\n  Fourth, add incentives that encourage and prepare schools to include \nchildren with disabilities in schoolwide innovation, reform efforts, \nand assessments of student progress.\n  Fifth, clearly link discretionary programs to the State grant \nprograms, so that discretionary grants help educators educate children \nwith disabilities and help families contribute in meaningful ways to \nthe educational process of their children.\n  We have done what we set out to do. We have crafted a bill that will \ntake us into the next century, a bill that celebrates the legacy \nestablished 20 years ago today, a bill that gives parents and educators \nthe tools they need to help young people with disabilities succeed, and \na bill that delivers on that timeless simple promise--a free \nappropriate public education for each child with a disability.\n  Such an education is an investment in people whose hopes, \nopportunities, and achievements are dependent on us. As we proceed with \nthe reauthorization process, I urge my colleagues to join me in \ncelebrating a law that works, a law that endures, a law that is most \nnecessary. Although the difference it has made may be measured in \ndollars and judged in terms of children served, its impact is more \npervasive, more powerful. Services it funds have lead to words read, \nconcepts understood, steps taken, and words spoken--often for the first \ntime. As such experiences are repeated, young people with disabilities \ndevelop pride and increased confidence \n\n[[Page S 17763]]\nin their achievements. IDEA is definitely a law worth recognizing, \ncelebrating, and preserving.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/11/29/senate-section/article/S17762-2", "month": "11", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "29", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S17763-S17764]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n     20TH ANNIVERSARY OF PUBLIC LAW 94-142, THE EDUCATION FOR ALL \n                   HANDICAPPED CHILDREN ACT OF 1975.\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, today marks the 20th anniversary of the \nsigning of Public Law 94-142, the Education for All Handicapped \nChildren Act, now known as Part B of the Individuals with Disabilities \nEducation Act [IDEA].\n  On that fall day two decades ago, we literally changed the world for \nmillions of children with disabilities. At that time, over 1 million \nchildren with disabilities in the United States were excluded entirely \nfrom the public school system, and more than half of all children with \ndisabilities were not receiving appropriate educational services.\n  On that day, we exclaimed that the days of exclusion, segregation, \nand denial of education of disabled children are over in this country.\n  On that day we sent a simple, yet powerful message heard around the \nworld: disability is a natural part of a child's experience that in no \nway diminishes the fundamental right of a disabled child to receive a \nfree and appropriate public education.\n  On that day, we also sent a powerful message that families count and \nthey must be treated as equal partners in the education of their \nchildren.\n  On that day we lit a beacon of hope for millions of children with \ndisabilities and their families.\n  Since the enactment of Public Law 94-142, considerable progress has \nbeen made in fulfilling the message that was conveyed by the Congress \nin 1975.\n  Today, 20 years later, every State now ensures a free appropriate \npublic education to all children with disabilities between the ages of \n3 and 18, and most States extend that provision through age 21. Over 5 \nmillion children with disabilities are now receiving special education \nand related services. And all States now provide early intervention \nservices to infants and toddlers with disabilities from birth through \nage two and their families.\n  Today, the beacon of hope is burning bright. As one parent from Iowa \nrecently told me:\n\n       Thank God for IDEA. IDEA gives us the strength to face the \n     challenges of bringing up a child with a disability. It has \n     kept our family together. Because of IDEA our child is \n     achieving academic success. He is also treated by his \n     nondisabled peers as ``one of the guys.'' I am now confident \n     that he will graduate high school prepared to hold down a job \n     and lead an independent life.\n\n  In May, Danette Crawford, a senior at Urbandale High School in Des \nMoines testified before the Disability Policy Subcommittee. Danette, \nwho has cerebral palsy, testified that:\n\n       My grade point average stands at 3.8 and I am enrolled in \n     advanced placement courses. The education I am receiving is \n     preparing me for a real future. Without IDEA, I am convinced \n     I would not be receiving the quality education that Urbandale \n     High School provides me.\n\n  Mr. President, these are not isolated statements from a few parents \nin Iowa. They are reflective of the general feeling about the law \nacross the country. The National Council on Disability [NCD] recently \nconducted 10 regional meetings throughout the Nation regarding progress \nmade in implementing the IDEA over the past 20 years. In its report, \nNCD stated that ``in all of the 10 regional hearings * * * there were \nringing affirmations in support of IDEA and the positive difference it \nhas made in the lives of children and youth with disabilities and their \nfamilies.'' The report adds that ``all across the country witnesses \ntold of the tremendous power of IDEA to help children with disabilities \nfulfill their dreams to learn, to grow, and to mature.''\n  Anniversaries are a time to celebrate; but they are also a time to \nreflect. So, as we look back on the enactment of IDEA, we must also \nstep back and ask some basic questions: Has the IDEA resulted in full \nequality of educational opportunity for all children with disabilities? \nShould we be satisfied with the educational outcomes we are achieving; \ncan we do better?\n  From the four hearings held by the Subcommittee on Disability Policy, \nit is clear to me that major changes in IDEA are not needed nor wanted. \nIDEA is as critical today as it was 20 years ago, particularly the due \nprocess protections. These provisions level the playing field so that \nparents can sit down as equal partners in designing an education for \ntheir children.\n  The witnesses at these hearings did make clear, however, that we need \nto fine-tune the law, in order to make sure that children with \ndisabilities are not left out of educational reform efforts that are \nnow underway, and to take what we have learned over the past 20 years \nand use it to update and improve this critical law.\n  Based on 20 years of experience and research in the education of \nchildren with disabilities, we have reinforced our thinking and \nknowledge about what is needed to make this law work, and we have \nlearned many new things that are important if we are to ensure an equal \neducational opportunity for all children with disabilities:\n  For example, our experience and knowledge over the past 20 years have \nreaffirmed that the provision of quality education and services to \nchildren with disabilities must be based on an individualized \nassessment of each child's unique needs and abilities; and that, to the \nmaximum extent appropriate, children with disabilities must be educated \nwith children who are not disabled and children should be removed from \nthe regular educational environment only when the nature and severity \nof the disability is such that education in regular classes with the \nuse of supplementary aids and services cannot be achieved \nsatisfactorily.\n  We have also learned that students with disabilities achieve at \nsignificantly higher levels when schools have high expectations--and \nestablish high goals--for these students, ensure their access to the \ngeneral curriculum--whenever appropriate--and provide them with the \nnecessary services and supports. And there is general agreement that \nincluding children with disabilities in general State and district-wide \nassessments is an effective accountability mechanism and a critical \nstrategy for improving educational results for these children.\n  Our experience over the past 20 years has underscored the fact that \nparent participation is a crucial component in the education of \nchildren with disabilities, and parents should have meaningful \nopportunities, through appropriate training and other supports, to \nparticipate as partners with teachers and other school staff in \nassisting their children to achieve to high standards. And we also know \nhow critical it is for school administrators to have the tools they \nneed to ensure school environments that are safe and conducive to \nlearning.\n  There is general agreement today at all levels of government that \nState and local educational agencies must be responsive to the \nincreasing racial, ethnic, and linguistic diversity that prevails in \nthe Nation's public schools today. Steps must be taken to ensure that \nthe procedures used for referring and evaluating children with \ndisabilities include appropriate safeguards to prevent the over- or \nunder-identification of minority students requiring special education. \nServices, supports, and other assistance must be provided in a \nculturally competent manner. And greater efforts must be made to \nimprove post-school results among minority students with disabilities.\n  The basic purposes of Public Law 94-142 must be retained under the \nproposed reauthorization of IDEA: To assist States and local \ncommunities meet their obligation to ensure that all children with \ndisabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education \nthat emphasizes special education and related services designed to meet \nthe unique needs of these children and enable them to lead productive \nindependent adult lives; to ensure that the rights of children with \ndisabilities and their parents are protected; and to assess and ensure \nthe effectiveness of efforts to educate children with disabilities.\n  We also need to expand those purposes to promote the improvement of \neducational services and results for children with disabilities and \nearly intervention services for infants and toddlers with \ndisabilities--by assisting or supporting systems change initiatives by \nState educational agencies in partnership with other interested \nparties, coordinated research and personnel preparation, and \ncoordinated technical assistance, dissemination, and \n\n[[Page S 17764]]\nevaluation, and technology development and media services.\n  The progress that has been made over the past 20 years in the \neducation of children with disabilities has been impressive. However, \nit is clear that significant challenges remain. We must ensure that \nthis crucial law not only remains intact as the centerpiece for \nensuring equal educational opportunity for all children with \ndisabilities, but also that it is strengthened and updated to keep \ncurrent with the changing times.\n  In closing, Mr. President, I would like to quote Ms. Melanie Seivert \nof Sibley IA, who is the parent of Susan, a child with Downs Syndrome. \nShe states:\n\n       Our ultimate goal for Susan is to be educated academically, \n     vocationally, [and] in life-skills and community living so as \n     an adult she can get a job and live her life with a minimum \n     of management from outside help. Through the things IDEA \n     provides * * * we will be able to reach our goals.\n       Does it not make sense to give all children the best \n     education possible? Our children need IDEA for a future.\n\n  Mr. President, IDEA is the shining light of educational opportunity. \nAnd, on this the 20th anniversary of the IDEA, we in the Congress must \nmake sure that the light continues to burn bright. We still have \npromises to keep.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/11/29/senate-section/article/S17763-1", "month": "11", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "29", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S17764-S17767]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   SAFE DRINKING WATER ACT AMENDMENTS\n\n  The Senate continued with the consideration of the bill.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, we are in the process of talking about the \nSafe Drinking Water Act now, I understand?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Good. I would like to do that.\n  Mr. President, I want to speak in behalf of this bill. I think it is \none that is very important to all of us, certainly important to my \nState. I congratulate Senator Kempthorne and Senator Chafee and Senator \nBaucus for the hard work and long time that has gone into it. This is \nan important bill. It has been very long in coming. Last year in the \nHouse we worked on this bill. I think it reflects a good deal of \nthoughtful consideration. Therefore, I believe it deserves the support \nof Members of this Senate.\n  It has been an inclusive process in which many people with many \ninterests have been involved. It is important that be the case. We are \ntalking here about a program that affects us all over the country, a \ncountry in which the effects are quite different. Certainly some of the \nsmall towns in Wyoming have different problems than Pittsburgh or Los \nAngeles, and one of the efforts we have to make is to make it flexible \nenough to reflect that. I think this bill does that. Overregulation, \ncertainly, has been on the minds of most people. It is much on the \nminds of the people I talk to in Wyoming. People are weary of the top-\ndown kinds of regulations, that one-size-fits-all sort of thing. It is \ndifficult to deal with that. I think this bill attempts to do that and \ndoes so in a very effective way.\n  The Safe Drinking Water Act, as it has been, has been an example of \nthe old approach, regulating substances that do not even occur in \ndrinking water and do not pose a risk in particular areas. I always \nthink of the efforts we made in Pinedale, WY, which has a water supply. \nThere is a very deep lake that is close. Even though the testing would \nshow that water was of excellent quality, they were, at least \nostensibly, required to invest a great deal of their taxpayers' money \nto do some things that probably were not necessary.\n\n  So people have asked for change and a new direction. The principle \nguiding this change is common sense. That is what I think we seek to do \nhere, and the sponsors of the bill have done so, I think, successfully. \nIt injects much-needed common sense into the regulatory process while \ndoing a better job at protecting public health.\n  The current mandate that 25 contaminants be regulated every 3 years \nregardless of whether there is a risk is repealed. The risk assessment \nis inserted into the process. States' roles are increased. Water \nsystems are able to focus their efforts and their resources monitoring \ncontaminants that actually occur in the systems. And that is good. In a \nword, the bill shatters the status quo.\n  I again thank the sponsors for their attention to a State like \nWyoming, which is different--small towns, different sources. So we have \nworked closely with Senators Kempthorne and Chafee to ensure that our \ncommunities did have the opportunity to take advantage of the funding \nmechanisms and the regulatory relief that this bill provides. I thank \nthem for that.\n  In addition, the small systems, as defined in this bill as those \nserving under 10,000, will be given special consideration when seeking \nways to comply with the regulations.\n  The bill is not perfect, of course, and there has been a great deal \nof effort going on each day, and some things needed to be changed. But \noverall the bill is an excellent one, and is an effort that will reduce \nthe cost to local communities, municipalities but allowing them to \nprotect effectively.\n  So I urge my colleagues to support the bill. I hope the other body \nwill act quickly, and the President will support our efforts. This bill \nis needed and we ought to move forward, and I urge that.\n  Mr. President, thank you. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Wyoming for \nhis statement on the floor, and I also thank him for his great support \nin the Environment and Public Works Committee. We are very happy to \nhave him as a cosponsor, and his addition to that committee on behalf \nof the voices of small town America and rural communities is extremely \nhelpful. We thank him.\n  Mr. CHAFEE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. I also want to thank the distinguished Senator from \nWyoming for his kind comments and for his help on this legislation. He \nis a very valuable member of our committee, and we appreciate \neverything he has done to help with this.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3077\n\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, on behalf of myself, Senators Kempthorne, \nBaucus, Reid, D'Amato, and Moynihan, I send to the desk a printed \namendment and ask for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, this authorizes the expenditure of $15 \nmillion a year for 7 years to the year 2003 for the protection of the \nwatershed of the city of New York. This is a very unusual approach that \nthey are trying in New York in which, instead of building very, very \nexpensive water treatment facilities that would amount to more than $1 \nbillion, they are trying to protect the watershed; in other words, the \nheadwaters of the rivers that provide the waters for the city of New \nYork up in the Hudson River Valley.\n  This provides authorization for $15 million for 7 years to be of \nassistance in that effort.\n  As I say, this is an amendment by both New York Senators, Senators \nMoynihan and D'Amato. I think it is a good amendment, Mr. President.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, on behalf of myself and Senator Moynihan, \nI wish to thank Senator Chafee and Senator Kempthorne for accepting \nthis crucial amendment--an amendment that will protect the drinking \nwater of 9 million persons.\n  New York City is home to our Nation's largest unfiltered surface \nwater supply delivering 1.5 billion gallons per day. It is also, \narguably, our Nation's best drinking water. To many, it would seem \nimplausible that our Nation's largest city could have such high quality \nwater and not require extensive filtration. However, extensive measures \nhave been taken over the years to ensure the purity of New York City's \nwater.\n  New York City's watershed actually consists of three distinct \ngeographic areas that cover some 1,900 square miles in 8 counties in \nNew York State--an area approximately the size of Rhode Island. Due to \nan act of the New York Legislature in 1907, and further amendments in \n1953, New York City has been able to regulate activities that affect \nwater quality in the watershed area. This capability caused its share \nof suspicion among farmers, homeowners, and local elected officials in \nthe upstate watershed. As one might suspect, these individuals did not \nnecessarily appreciate the city having a say as to how they could \nutilize their land.\n  With development creeping out of the metropolitan area and into the \nwatershed area, many became concerned about the consequences of such \ngrowth on water quality. Echoing that concern, under the auspices of \nthe 1986 Safe Drinking Water Act amendments, the EPA required New York \nCity in 1989 to either further protect the watershed or filter. It was \napparent that enhanced protection efforts would be necessary if the \nwater supply for the city was to be preserved without spending billions \nof dollars to build filtration plants. This set in motion the impetus \nto negotiate a filtration avoidance plan that would meet the approval \nof the EPA, provide safe drinking water to New York City residents, and \npreserve the rights of upstate New Yorkers to prudently utilize their \nland. Until recently, the ability to balance all of these needs had not \nproven entirely successful and watershed protection efforts stalled.\n  In early November, though, New York Governor George Pataki announced \nwhat many had thought impossible. In an unprecedented agreement, the \nState of New York, the city of New York, environmentalists, local \nelected officials within the watershed and the Environmental Protection \nAgency all gave their approval to a plan to protect the New York City \nwatershed and avoid large-scale filtration. Under the terms of the \nagreement, a total of $1.2 billion will be spent by the city of New \nYork over the next 15 years for water quality protection programs while \nupstate communities will continue to be able to grow and prosper in \nenvironmentally responsible ways.\n  Specifically, the city expects to increase its landholdings in the \nwatershed threefold spending a minimum of $260 million for purchases in \nthe most sensitive areas from willing sellers. Also, the city will \nspend close to $400 million on water quality protection programs in the \nwatershed communities in addition to the programs required to be \nundertaken by EPA for the city to avoid filtration. Also, a new \nregional watershed council will be created to serve in an advisory \nrole. The city will continue its plans to spend over $600 million in \nalready committed funds to build a filtration plant for the Croton \nwatershed. Finally, the New York State Department of Health will \napprove and promulgate new watershed regulations to replace the \nexisting outdated regulations.\n  By undertaking these activities, the city of New York will avoid the \nconstruction of a filtration system for the Catskill/Delaware watershed \ncosting upwards of $8 billion. The construction of such massive \nfiltration plants would have likely dramatically increased water \npayments for each household in New York City.\n  While this historic agreement will lay the groundwork for the \nprotection of New York's watershed, it will only be successful if \neffective and sophisticated monitoring is in place. It would not be \nfiscally wise to spend over $1 billion without an ability to determine \nwhether the protection efforts are working.\n  To address this concern, Senator Moynihan and I have offered this \namendment that will allow the EPA to spend up to $15 million per year \nfor 7 years in the State of New York in order to monitor and implement \na host of watershed protection programs in the New York City watershed. \nSome of the projects that will be undertaken and in need of Federal \nassistance are: a phosphorus offset program designed to reduce the \ntotal amount of phosphorus in sensitive watershed basins; wastewater \ndiversion; wastewater micro-filtration treatment; enhanced stormwater \ncontrol activities; and agricultural and forestry best management \npractices. Federal funding could be utilized for up to 35 percent of a \nproject's total cost. Should water quality decline, the EPA will have \nthe ability to demand appropriate changes.\n  Our amendment is a perfect complement to the efforts being undertaken \nin New York State to protect the watershed in a scientifically sound \nand fiscally responsible manner. Under our amendment, scientists will \nbe better able to monitor the quality of the drinking water of some 9 \nmillion people and prevent degradation of this vital watershed before \nit becomes a matter of concern. This will be able to be done at a \nspend-out rate of $12 to every $1 spent by the Federal Government.\n  I am pleased that the managers of this bill agree with the need to \nprotect this precious resource. With the passage of this amendment, the \nState of \n\n[[Page S 17766]]\nNew York will be given an opportunity to further protect its valuable \nwatershed. I am confident that the efforts undertaken in New York will \nbe able to serve as a model for similar activities in other parts of \nthe country.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate on the amendment? If \nnot, the question is on agreeing to the amendment of the Senator from \nRhode Island.\n  The amendment (No. 3077) was agreed to.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote by which the \namendment was agreed to.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mrs. MURRAY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, the bill we have before us provides an \nexcellent example of how good people, working together, can find a way \nto balance safety and cost concerns. I commend the bipartisan effort \nthat developed the Safe Drinking Water Amendments Act of 1995. I also \nrise to thank these same chairmen and ranking members for agreeing to \nthe amendment that Senator Gorton and I proposed regarding the city of \nSeattle's water supply that was approved earlier today.\n  Safe drinking water is probably the single most important thing a \ngovernment can supply its people. This bill, S. 1316, accomplishes that \ntask by giving the Environmental Protection Agency flexibility to set \ndrinking water standards based on peer-reviewed science. It encourages \nState and local governments to become full partners in the development, \nimplementation, and enforcement of drinking water regulations. It \ntargets our scarce public resources toward greater health risks and \naway from more trivial risks.\n  S. 1316 will be particularly helpful for small systems serving fewer \nthan 10,000 people. These small systems will be eligible for variances \nthat allow them to use affordable treatment technology. While \nregulators may grant variances, S. 1316 also authorizes consumers to \nparticipate in the decision to grant a variance and requires variance \nrenewals every 5 years. I have heard from many small communities about \nhow burdensome the current Safe Drinking Water Act requirements are. I \nshare their enthusiasm for the flexibility and innovation contained in \nthis bill.\n  I also want to draw my colleagues' attention to the amendment Senator \nGorton and I proposed regarding the city of Seattle water supply. With \nour amendment, Seattle will be able to provide its customers safer \nwater, at a lower cost, and with a better taste than it could have \nunder current filtration requirements. Our amendment will allow local \ngovernments that have undeveloped watersheds with a consolidated \nownership to use a process other than filtration if that alternative \nensures significantly greater removal of pathogens.\n  The Seattle Water Department has concluded that ozonation, a process \ncommonly used in Europe, may provide 100 times more protection from \nCryptosporidium and other pathogens than would a filtration system. \nShould ozonation deliver as much protection as it promises, the people \nof Seattle will have safer water and will pay $130 million less for \nthat safety than they would have had to pay for a Cedar River watershed \nfiltration system.\n  Mr. President, like all bills that pass through the process of \ncompromise and negotiation, S. 1316 is not perfect. However, it is a \ngood bill that goes a long way toward solving some of the more \ntroublesome aspects of the current Safe Drinking Water Act. This bill \noffers responsible reform, flexibility, and balance. I have heard from \na number of local governments urging my full support of this bill. I \nintend to offer that support, while at the same time voting in favor of \nstronger right-to-know provisions.\n  Again, I thank the chairmen and ranking members for their hard work \non this bill and for accepting Sen. Gorton's and my amendment.\n\n\n                         Seattle's Water Supply\n\n  Mr. President, I rise in support of the Safe Drinking Water \nAmendments Act of 1995 and commend the managers on their excellent \nwork. In addition, I would like to address the amendment that Senator \nGorton and I proposed, which was accepted as a managers' amendment, \nthat will provide the people of the city of Seattle with quality \ndrinking water at an affordable price. Like this bill before us, our \namendment seeks to protect our citizens from unnecessary costs while \nproviding safe, high quality drinking water.\n  Our amendment requires the EPA to amend its drinking water protection \ncriteria to allow a State to establish treatment requirements other \nthan filtration where a watershed is uninhabited, has consolidated \nownership and has controlled access. Our amendment allows an \nalternative to filtration where EPA determines that the quality of the \nsource water and alternative treatment requirements established by the \nState ensure significantly greater pathogen removal efficiencies than \nwould a combination of filtration and chlorine disinfection.\n  Mr. President, the Cedar River watershed is unique. The city of \nSeattle will own 100 percent of this 90,490 acre watershed by the end \nof the year. The city controls access to and activity in this \nwatershed. It practices model land stewardship, supplying a wide \nvariety of public values, including healthy populations of wildlife. In \nshort, it is a crown jewel. It is the type of water supply all major \ncities should aspire to have.\n  The watershed met all of the criteria for remaining an unfiltered \nsupplier for the first 18 months after passage of the SDWA amendments \nof 1986. However, because of a severe drought and an abundance of \nwildlife, the watershed exceeded one of the unfiltered water criteria, \nthat of fecal coliform. After receiving notification of noncompliance, \nthe Seattle Water Department began investigating filtration and non-\nfiltration systems to ensure it would satisfy requirements of the SDWA.\n  The water department discovered that a process widely used in Europe, \ncalled ozonation, would reliably remove more cryptosporidium and \ngiardia--the pathogens of most concern--than would filtration. An \nozonation facility would inactivate 99.999 percent of cryptosporidium, \nwhile filtration would inactivate only 99.9 percent. In simple terms, \nozonation can be economically designed to provide two orders of \nmagnitude, or 100 times greater protection than filtration. Not only is \nozonation more effective against the most serious threats to the \nSeattle water supply, but it costs less and makes the water taste \nbetter.\n  The Seattle Water Department's studies indicate that an ozonation \nplant would cost its customers $68 million, while a filtration plant \nwould cost $198 million. While Seattle water officials believe that the \nCedar River water may require filtration sometime in the future, the \nsystem has a number of other more pressing needs--such as covering \nopen, in-city reservoirs and installing a filtration plant in the Tolt \nRiver watershed--that make ozonation the best course for today. The \nozonation plant will be built in such a way as to be compatible with a \nfiltration plant should the need for one arise in the future.\n  Mr. President, this amendment offers the city of Seattle needed \nflexibility so that it can provide its customers the safest water at \nthe lowest cost in the very near future. It is worth re-stating that \nthis filtration flexibility may be given only where a watershed is \nundeveloped and, most importantly, the alternative to filtration proves \nto ensure significantly greater pathogen removal efficiencies. \nDelivering safe drinking water is the fundamental goal of this \namendment and this bill.\n  Again, I thank the bill's managers for their assistance and support \non our amendment and in developing the comprehensive, balanced Safe \nDrinking Water Amendments Act of 1995.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be \nallowed to speak as if in morning business for 5 \n\n[[Page S 17767]]\nminutes without the time being charged to the bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I come to the floor of the Senate this \nevening to address an issue which is of great concern to this Nation \nand to many of my colleagues--and that is Bosnia. This past Monday, the \nPresident took his proposal to the American people and he appears to \nhave listened to the majority of Americans by coming forward and \nstating his case for the United States' involvement in Bosnia.\n  Although the President was wise to come to the American people, I \nlike many of my colleagues, cannot support the President's decision to \nsend troops because I do not know that he has fully explained what \n``American values'' are at stake in Bosnia.\n  In my home State of Colorado, I have five offices. Without exception, \nthe phones have been ringing and my constituents have been voicing \ntheir concerns, their fears, their anger, and their opposition to the \nPresident's proposal. Today they see no threat to our national security \nor to our way of life, although they do have great empathy for the \npeople in Bosnia.\n  Bosnia has proven to be a quagmire time and time again. I, like many \nof my colleagues, do not want to see our troops placed in harm's way in \nthis region. We surely do not want to repeat the problems that we had \nin either Vietnam or Somalia.\n  I believe the new-found peace in Bosnia is untenable and cannot be \nguaranteed. I believe there are 120,000 Serbs over there who basically \nsaid the same thing.\n  It is foolish for us to believe that there will not be mission \nchanges during our proposed 12-month involvement in the region. The \nenvironment in Bosnia will continue to change as time goes on, and we \ncannot predict what will be asked of us during the next 12 months. What \nstarts out to be a peacekeeping mission will certainly became a nation-\nrebuilding mission at the expense of the American taxpayers.\n  I do not believe the President fully appreciates the fact that you \ncannot, under the best of circumstances, give a definitive end date for \ninvolvement in that military mission.\n  By nature, military missions are unpredictable. We have no way to \ndetermine how long it will take before peace is freestanding in the \nregion. In 12 months, the Bosnian peace may be at a pivotal stage so \nthat we cannot pull out, we cannot bring our troops home, and that is \nwhat I fear the most.\n  That region has a history of internal struggles. The country is torn \nand has always been torn by deeply held religious beliefs, and we \ncannot socially engineer a peace. Peace will never come easily to this \nregion, and there are still those today who oppose the agreement.\n  I am most concerned that the United States will be making up 30 \npercent of the NATO force in addition to all of the air support and the \nlogistics of the mission. This is far more than any of the other 15 \nNATO members. As a result, we will also be contributing a large part of \nthe funds for this mission. In this time of fiscal restraint of asking \neveryone to do more with less, I cannot understand how the President \ncan ask us to ante up for this commitment, continue to insist on \nincreased levels of domestic spending, and still work to balance the \nbudget in 7 years as he has indicated he would.\n  I support our treaty obligations to NATO. However, in this instance I \nfeel our obligations simply do not outweigh our concerns for our \nAmerican youngsters that we have to send into harm's way.\n  We all support the efforts to end the atrocities and suffering. \nHowever, I do not believe that we have any vital national security \ninterests in that region, as we did in the Gulf war. I also believe \nthat we have a humanitarian interest in the region, but I do not think \nthe American people solely support the humanitarian rationale as \njustification for sending our ground troops into Bosnia. Certainly \nColoradans do not.\n  Above all, we cannot afford to forget the reality of the situation we \nare sending our troops into: A newly founded and untenable peace. In \nthat environment, there will undoubtedly be continued hostilities. I am \nabsolutely convinced that we will have American dead by Christmas, if \nnot by hidden enemy, certainly from one of the 6 million buried mines \nthat still exist.\n  The parents and families of these Americans we are asking to go to \nBosnia are those the Congress and the President must answer to. I \nbelieve that we should be most thoughtful before this administration \nputs us in a position where we might have American youngsters dead by \nChristmas.\n  With that, I yield the floor, Mr. President.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/11/29/senate-section/article/S17767-1", "month": "11", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "29", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S17767-S17774]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               SAFE DRINKING WATER ACT AMENDMENTS OF 1995\n\n  The Senate continued with the consideration of the bill.\n  Mr. CHAFEE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, we have a very good bill before us. I for \none am just delighted to see it come here. It has been very bipartisan. \nI commend the chairman, the ranking member, Senator Kempthorne, and \nSenator Reid, all of whom have worked so hard on this bill. I am \nparticularly pleased, being a member of the Environment and Public \nWorks Committee, that my biggest priority was taken care of in this \nbill, which involved assurance that our drinking water will protect the \nmost vulnerable populations.\n  I had an amendment that did carry on this bill the last time it came \nbefore the body, and basically it makes sure that children, infants, \npregnant women, and the chronically ill are not overlooked when we set \nstandards. We know that more than 100 people who died as a result of \ndrinking water in Milwaukee last year were from vulnerable groups such \nas children, the elderly, transplant patients, and AIDS patients. About \n400,000 people in Milwaukee got sick as a result of contaminated \ndrinking water. We hear very large numbers coming out of CDC, The \nCenters for Disease Control. One report that says 900 people die from \ncontaminated tap water every year.\n  So, Mr. President, this is an important bill, and I am proud that we \nare here at this moment. I would also like to thank Senators Chafee and \nBaucus for agreeing to my amendment to authorize the Southwest Center \nfor Environmental Research and Policy. It is very important. It is a \nconsortium of American and Mexican universities that work to address \nenvironmental problems along the United States-Mexico border, including \nbut not limited to air quality, water quality, and hazardous materials, \nand it is important to a lot of our States. San Diego State University \nis involved in it, New Mexico State University, University of Utah, \nUniversity of Texas, Arizona State University as well. So that is my \npraise for this bill.\n  Mr. President, I think we need to do more. I think we should do more. \nI am very proud that the Democratic leader, Senator Daschle, has joined \nme in offering this community right-to-know amendment. It is supported \nby over 60 environmental groups and the Environmental Protection \nAgency, and I will at the end of my remarks ask that the EPA's letter \nbe included in the Record so everyone can see it.\n  The American Public Health Association, League of Conservation \nVoters, Consumer Federation of America, League of Women Voters, \nPhysicians for Social Responsibility, the Natural Resources Defense \nCouncil, the Sierra Club, the American Baptist Church, the United \nMethodist Board of Churches Society all support the Boxer-Daschle \namendment.\n  Frankly, I am at a loss to understand why we do not just make this \nhappen. I have great respect for my leaders on the committee. Perhaps \nthey have negotiated a compromise they feel they do not want to \ndisturb. But I cannot back off in terms of presenting it because I feel \nstrongly about it. I believe the community has a right to know what is \nin the drinking water.\n  Mr. President, 89 percent of the American people are asking for this. \nThey want more information about the quality of their drinking water.\n  It would ensure that consumers are informed about the levels of \ncontaminants found in their drinking water once a year through the mail \nin an easy-to-understand explanation of what is in their water and what \nthe health risks are, if any.\n  Mr. President, I ask that you let me know when I have used up 10 \nminutes of my 15 minutes of time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair informs the Senator that the times \nwere divided 20 minutes per side, not 15 minutes.\n  Does the Senator wish to be informed at 10 minutes remaining?\n  Mr. BAUCUS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I know, although the earlier agreement was \n20 minutes on a side formally, we have agreed to 15 minutes. It may be \npresumptuous of me, but I ask unanimous consent that the earlier \nunanimous-consent agreement be modified so it is 15 minutes per side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I ask that the Chair inform me when I have \nused 10 minutes.\n  What is very important about this community right-to-know amendment \nis that we exempt small water systems that serve 10,000 persons or \nless. So we are mindful of not putting a burden on the small systems. \nWe also allow the Governor to opt out as long as he explains why.\n  This is a national bill. Safe drinking water is a national priority; \notherwise, we would not be here. So the argument that we should not \ntell the Governors what to do just does not fly. We are telling water \nsystems what to do, we are setting safety levels, and all this does is \nsay, ``Let's also let the consumers know.''\n  My amendment requires EPA to issue regulations within 3 years that \nwould govern the implementation of this. The reason is, we want it to \nbe very simple. The objective of the Boxer-Daschle amendment is not to \ninflict consumers with a complex table of chemicals they never heard \nof, nor to scare consumers about the quality of their water, but to let \nthem know what they need to know.\n  Let me be specific. I have a new grandchild, and that grandchild is \nthe most precious thing to me and to his family. When that grandchild \nvisits Washington, DC, I am not sure if I should mix that formula with \nthe tap water, because there has been an advisory of late to be \ncareful.\n  I think it is important for people to know if they should, in fact, \nmix that formula with tap water. They should know, if they are \nconcerned about an elderly person, whether the water is safe. I heard \ncolleagues say, ``Oh, it is too much information for people; too much. \nWe don't want to load them down with pages of information.''\n  Here is one report, a terrific one that comes out of Ohio where they \nshow people what causes cloudy water, what causes rusty water. In other \nwords, when you send out these things, it is an opportunity to put \npeople's minds at ease. It is not just a question of frightening them. \nIs there lead in my drinking water? And then they show where the \nvarious plants are located, where the water comes from and the various \nchemicals that are in the water.\n  So if someone does have someone living with them who is part of a \nvulnerable population--be it an infant, be it a child under 6, be it a \ngrandma, a grandpa who has some problem, be it a cancer victim, be it \nan AIDS victim--we would have an opportunity to know if, in fact, that \nwater could harm them.\n  We have over 60 public interest, environmental, and public health \ngroups supporting us, and I gave you just a few of those, and we will \nput the rest into the Record.\n  But I do believe that the Boxer-Daschle amendment will also benefit \nwater suppliers because it will increase consumer awareness of how \ntheir local water system performs and what challenges that system faces \nas it tries to maintain water quality.\n  We have a water board in our home county, and they come to us once in \na while and say, ``You know, we have to increase your water rates.''\n  ``Why?''\n  If I know it is to make that water safer, if it is to make sure \ncontaminants are taken out of the water, that is a plus for that water \ndistrict, and there will be more support.\n  Currently, consumers are required to be notified only if a water \nsupplier violates an enforceable standard. Consumers do not have to be \ntold if their tap water contains common contaminants which are not \nregulated, such as cryptosporidium and radioactive radon. We know \ncryptosporidium kills people. We do not happen to have a standard \nestablished for cryptosporidium. Does that mean we should not let \npeople know if it is in their water supply?\n  I certainly hope people will support this amendment because then \nconsumers will know if cryptosporidium is in their water supply, at \nwhat level, and whether it is dangerous. And if they have a little \nchild in the home or someone from a vulnerable population, they can act \naccordingly.\n  In the case of arsenic, an EPA-regulated contaminant, the current \nstandard is being revised by the EPA because it is a weak standard that \nwas set in 1942 before we knew that arsenic caused cancer. In the bill \nwe are considering, the EPA will not have to issue a revised standard \nuntil the year 2001 and no enforceable standard until \n\n[[Page S 17769]]\n2004. I believe consumers have a right to know whether or not the water \nthey drink contains arsenic at levels that could be a potential risk to \ntheir health.\n  Why not let consumers know? Why treat people like they do not deserve \nto know or they will misuse the information? We are all adults. We \ndeserve to know. We are paying money for that water. We ought to know \nwhat it contains.\n  Under current law, not even a crisis, an outbreak such as the 1993 \nMilwaukee cryptosporidium outbreak which killed over 100 people, not \neven a crisis forces water systems to warn consumers about the presence \nof dangerous levels of unregulated contaminants.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Snowe). The Senator from California has 5 \nminutes.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Thank you, Madam President. I am going to withhold \nbecause I know my colleagues are going to make some terrific arguments \nagainst me, and I want to be ready to combat them, so I retain my time.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Madam President, I, unfortunately, must oppose this \namendment, although I do appreciate the efforts of the Senator from \nCalifornia to work with the concerns that I had expressed on this. I \ntruly do appreciate that.\n  I do not oppose this amendment because I believe that consumers \nshould not have access to information about the safety of the tap water \nthat they drink. Our bill already requires drinking water systems to \ngive information to consumers of any health threats presented by \ndrinking water and of any violations. These provisions ensure that \nconsumers have access to information that they need to protect \nthemselves, if that is necessary.\n  Let me just state for you, Madam President, what the bill \nspecifically provides.\n  First, each water system is required to notify their customers within \n24 hours of any violation of a drinking water standard that results in \nan immediate health concern.\n  Second, for all other violations of Federal drinking water standards \nand requirements, public water systems are required to notify their \ncustomers of those violations as soon as possible but within 1 year of \nthe violation.\n  Third, and finally, the State and EPA are required to publish an \nannual report disclosing all violations by drinking water systems in \nthe State. That report also must be made available to the public.\n  As has been pointed out, the State of California has in its system \nalready a program very similar to what the Senator from California has \ndiscussed. Therefore, there is nothing to preclude a State from doing \nexactly what the Senator from California is saying she feels should be \ndone, but it ought to be left to the prerogative of the States.\n  California has chosen to do so. There may be other States that will \nchoose to do so, but why in the world should we have the Federal \nGovernment say that you must do this? We spent quite a bit of time \nearlier today talking about unfunded Federal mandates. We took S. 1316 \nand gave it to the Congressional Budget Office and said, ``Please \nreview this and score this and determine if, in any way, we are \nproviding any new unfunded Federal mandates.'' Their letter came back \nand said, ``No, you are not.''\n  But with regard to this particular amendment, the Senator from \nCalifornia also sent to the Congressional Budget Office a question as \nto how much would it cost. The Congressional Budget Office came back \nand said the requirement nationwide would be between $1.5 to $10 \nmillion annually. That is an unfunded Federal mandate, and the $1.5 to \n$10 million annually could be used in tremendous opportunities by some \nof the small systems to achieve the standards that are necessary for \nthe public health that we are trying to improve.\n  So for those reasons, Madam President, I respectfully have to oppose \nthis amendment. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. CHAFEE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Madam President, I am always very, very reluctant to \noppose any amendment by the distinguished Californian who is a member \nof our Environment and Public Works Committee, a very able member of \nthat committee and contributes a great deal. So it is with some \ntrepidation that I rise to differ with her views on this particular \namendment.\n  It seems to me that this is not a necessary amendment, and, frankly, \nI do not think we should be adopting amendments that do not seem to \nhave a necessity to them.\n  Now, as has been pointed out, in the legislation we have submitted, \nS. 1316, if one looks at the report of the committee on page 136, it \nstarts setting forth there what are the requirements that we have \nregarding notice. And indeed, on page 137, under (D)(1), ``Regulations \nissued under subparagraph (a) shall specify notification procedures for \nviolations, other than the violations covered by subparagraph (c), and \nthe procedures specify that a public water system shall provide written \nnotice to each person served by the system by notice in the first bill \nprepared after the date of occurrence.''\n  In other words, if there is a violation of the law, then it is \nrequired that notice be given. I think that is adequate. Madam \nPresident, as the distinguished chairman of the subcommittee, Senator \nKempthorne, just pointed out, there is a system for not only this \nnotification, but if we want a more broad notification, then go ahead \nand do it. The States can pass such a law.\n  Indeed, let me just demonstrate here, if I might, a two-sided piece \nof paper which is, I suppose, something like 14 inches long, issued by \nthe State of Maryland, pursuant to Maryland law, by the Patuxent and \nPotomac Water Filtration Plants. It is just unintelligible. I think \nthis is what everybody is going to receive. Let me give an \nillustration. It says down here, ``1-1, dichlorothane; 1-3, \ndichloropropane.'' That goes on to say that it deals with a number of \nmicrograms per liter. It is not detected, it says, in Patuxent and in \nPotomac. Again, ``maximum monthly averages not detected.'' And it goes \non to say that there is no limit established up or down by EPA on this.\n  In other words, apparently, the Maryland law is that there must be \nclose to 80 substances or potential contaminants that have to be \nnotified. Anybody that receives this--99.9 percent of the people that \nreceive it must say, ``What is this?'' and dispose of it in the \nwastebasket.\n  It seems to me that it is really an unnecessary expenditure. So, \nMadam President, I reluctantly oppose the amendment by the Senator from \nCalifornia on the basis that if some State wants it, go ahead and do \nit. That is their business. If they do not want to do it, then we have \nsome protective provisions in the current law, as I have previously \npointed out.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Madam President, how much time is remaining on each side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 8 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Madam President, I will take 4 minutes. All of us greatly \nadmire the Senator from California. I do not know any Senator, frankly, \nwho is a stronger advocate for environmental protection than the \nSenator from California. She is very persistent and perceptive in her \nefforts to protect the environment. She has already said--and I think \nmost Senators agree--that the bill before us is a very good safe \ndrinking water bill. It sets very good--more than good, excellent \nstandards--that apply to States around the country as they direct their \nsystems to comply with certain standards and contaminant levels and so \nforth.\n  The amendment the Senator from California offers, I think, goes too \nfar. Essentially, it says that what California is doing, issuing \nreports to each consumer with respect to a whole lot of information, \nnow must apply to all States; that is, the Federal Government must \nadopt the same requirement. It is regulatory overkill.\n  Let me very briefly indicate some of the specifics that this \namendment would require systems to provide to consumers. It would \nrequire reporting the source--I do not know whether this means \ngroundwater, rivers, or whatever. It requires reporting on content, \nthat could be most anything. The quality of the water requirement is \nvague. A multiworded explanation of the health implications of \ncontaminants relative to national primary drinking water regulations is \nrequired. Even though the State and the system may \n\n[[Page S 17770]]\nbe meeting all the standards, still consumers have to be notified as to \nthe health implications of those contaminants--even though regulated. I \nam just touching the tip of the iceberg listing the requirements that \nmust be given to consumers. The long and short of it is, if California \nor any State wants to, according to its own law, require a whole host \nof information about what the water contains, even though the system is \nmeeting all the standards required by law, then let that State make \nthat decision.\n  One reason we are here today writing this bill and making amendments \nto the Safe Drinking Water Act is because, under the 1986 amendments to \nthe act, we unfortunately required systems, States, and the EPA to do \nway too much, to dilute its resources pursuing a lot of different \nefforts, instead of concentrating on the most egregious contaminants \nand problems and focusing priorities on the problems a system should \nmeet to make sure the water is as pure as can be for the consumers.\n  If systems do what this amendment proposes, it would further dilute \nand distract resources. Systems would have to spend a lot of time \ntrying to figure out what all this is, even though they are doing what \nis required of them and meeting the law.\n  I urge Senators to look and see what is in this amendment. I think \nthey will realize that we should not be requiring all States to do \nsomething that one State may want to do. If a State chooses to do so, \nfine. This does not limit States from taking these actions. I do not \nthink we should require all this additional information which, as the \nSenator from Rhode Island pointed out, is not going to be read. I know \nthe interest groups will do a good job of filing lawsuits and doing \nwhatever they want to do if a State system is not meeting standards. \nThey should. I take my hat off to them. But we should not go overboard \nwith a lot of red tape and bombard people with information they are not \neven going to read.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Madam President, as the author the community right-\nto-know law that requires notification of the public of releases of \ntoxics into the environment, I rise in support of the amendment of the \nSenator from California, Senator Boxer.\n  This amendment requires local water providers to notify their \ncustomers at least annually of the quality of their drinking water so \nthey can properly monitor the water for possible health effects.\n  Madam President, shining the light on the behavior of corporations \nand governments has repeatedly led to significant environmental \nadvances. When accidents, or discharges, or violations must be reported \nto the customers, quality improves. This has been proven dramatically \nin the case of the community right-to-know legislation.\n  The right-to-know law does not require a company to lower its use or \nemissions of any chemical one ounce. The right-to-know law was intended \nto notify neighbors about chemicals that were being discharged. \nCompanies did not like the bad publicity.\n  In addition, the law brought to the attention of corporate executives \nthe fact that expensive chemicals were leaving their facilities as \nwaste, not product. In response to these reports, companies voluntarily \ninstituted pollution prevention measures that have lowered toxic \nreleases tremendously. Emissions from facilities have decreased 42 \npercent nationwide since 1989; a reduction of two billion pounds.\n  Virtually none of those reductions were required by federal law; they \nwere voluntarily done by companies who found a better way to do \nbusiness, encouraged by this law.\n  Senator Boxer's amendment is likely to have similar, positive \neffects. It will mean cleaner drinking water for consumers. It also \nwill give individual Americans complete information about the quality \nand safety of their drinking water. This will allow consumers to decide \nfor themselves whether they want to buy bottled water, or take other \nsteps to protect themselves from unhealthy drinking water.\n  I urge support for this amendment.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I thank the Senator from New Jersey; he is the author of \nthe community right-to-know law that requires notification to the \npublic of releases of toxics in the environment. He strongly backs this \namendment. He says, ``This will allow consumers to decide for \nthemselves whether they want to buy bottled water, or take other steps \nto protect themselves.'' This is life and death, Madam President.\n  Madam President, has all time expired on the other side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 3 minutes 30 seconds remaining.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I would appreciate it if they will take their time so I \ncan finish the debate. It is my amendment.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Madam President, how much time remains on each side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California has 5 minutes. The \nSenator from Rhode Island has 3 minutes 30 seconds.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I will retain 1 minute of my time, and I will speak for 4 \nminutes. First of all, I think the comments made by my colleagues are \nterrific, but they are not right.\n  Madam President, I have to make a number of points here. My colleague \nfrom Montana says, oh, what does this mean, and he holds up this \namendment. This has been in operation in California for 6 years. Nobody \never asks what does it mean. Everyone thinks it is terrific, and \neverybody understands what it means.\n  In addition, we worked with the EPA because they had constructive \nsuggestions. They worked with us on every word of this amendment.\n  My friend from Idaho makes a point that I would like to address. He \nsays, ``My God, we go a long way in this bill. You have to be told \nthere is a violation if your water standard is in violation of the \nlaw.''\n  I have to point out to my friend that in 1993 the GAO did a very \nimportant report entitled ``Consumers Often Not Well-Informed of \nPotentially Serious Violations in their Water Supply.'' They concluded \nthat 63 percent of violations were not reported at all. Of these, over \nhalf of the violations posed serious long-term health risks such as \nlong-term cancer risk.\n  Now, that is GAO. That is not some environmental organization. That \nis an investigative arm of the Congress. The fact is, these violations \nmore than half the time are not reported. I do not want to wait for \nthere to be an outbreak of cryptosporidium and people die and then we \nnotify them, ``Boil your water.''\n  I think people have a right to know on a regular basis what is in \ntheir water. I do not think it is in any way encroaching.\n  We are so clear: Systems that serve 10,000 persons or less are \nexempted from this. Governors can opt out by explaining why. And the \ncost, if you take the maximum cost, is 23 cents per household per year. \nMadam President, 23 cents per year to know if there is cryptosporidium \nin your water.\n  Just talk to someone who lost a loved one from cryptosporidium in the \nwater supply. Would it be worth 23 cents a year? And, by the way, the \nGovernor can opt out. So there is no unfunded mandate if the Governor \ncan opt out.\n  The American Public Health Association wants to see this amendment \nbecome the law of the land. This is not extreme. This is a national \nsafe drinking water act. National standards are set. We should be \nstanding up here for the consumer, for taxpayers, for that water user \nwho pays for that water, to have the information they need to keep \ntheir families safe.\n  The first time there is an outbreak of cryptosporidium, people will \nrush to this floor and say, ``Boxer was right,'' and so was Senator \nDaschle because he happens to be the lead cosponsor, and Senator \nLautenberg who spent so much of his career making sure consumers have \nthe right to know if there are toxins in our environment.\n  I would like to add Senator Kohl as a cosponsor.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Madam President, let me just say this to the very able \narguments of the Senator from California. They are able arguments.\n  I suppose that when she makes the point that the Governor can opt out \nor that it does not apply to those systems of 10,000 or less that it \nworks the other way around.\n  If this is such a vital amendment and so necessary, why do we have it \nthat a Governor can just opt out of it? Or if it is so important, why \ndo we exclude 87 percent of the water systems in the Nation? Madam \nPresident, 87 percent of the water systems in the Nation serve 10,000 \nor fewer people. \n\n[[Page S 17771]]\n\n  That is not to say that 87 percent of the population is served by \nthat. I am not making that suggestion. But 87 percent of all the water \nsystems in the Nation are small ones. They are exempt from this bill.\n  Madam President, I say this is a good piece of legislation. One of \nthe things we have done here is to provide money to train the operators \nof these systems to be better. We have provided for better technical \nassistance than previously existed. We encourage consolidations.\n  I think we have done a lot of things to improve the safety of the \nwater that the users drink, in addition to the provisions that I have \npreviously mentioned that deal specifically with notification in case \nthe water is not safe.\n  I do appreciate the arguments of the distinguished Senator.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island has 1 minute and \n43 seconds remaining.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Madam President, the Senator from California makes a very \nimpassioned statement. It sounds very good.\n  The facts are, very simply, if California or if any State wants to go \nfar above and beyond what is required by Federal law, I think it makes \nsense for that State to do so if that State wants to do so. I do not \nthink the Federal Government should make this additional requirement on \nall States just because California is doing it. If California wants to, \nfine. But the U.S. Congress should not make a judgment as to whether an \nadditional requirement to each individual consumer, which has no \nbearing whatever to whether the systems in a State meet standards. If \nthe State wants to, fine. I do not think the Federal Government should \nmake that requirement on all States.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. We yield back the balance.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Madam President, I will finish. When anyone does not like \nan argument, they tell you you are emotional. Let me just say the \nAmerican Public Health Association is not emotional about this. They \njust say, ``We need to know. We need to know what is in our water \nsupply.''\n  I say to my friend from Rhode Island, the distinguished and able \nchairman, for whom I have the greatest respect, that 83 percent of the \nAmerican people will be covered by this Boxer amendment because they \nare served by the larger water systems.\n  To those who oppose this amendment, I ask, suppose that your loved \none is elderly or ill, has a compromised immune system because of \ncancer, chemotherapy, a recent transplant, or for other reasons, or \nthere is a little baby in the house that you are mixing that formula \nwith water from the tap, suppose you knew your water supplier knew all \nalong there was a level of cryptosporidium in the water but never told \nyou, because in 63 percent of the cases, the GAO says they do not \nreport violations.\n  That is not emotion. That is fact. The GAO study found 63 percent of \nthe violations are not reported. I make sure if cryptosporidium is in \nyour water system, you would know whether you live in Maine or \nCalifornia or Montana or Rhode Island or South Carolina.\n  I hope that people will vote against the motion to table, which I \nassume is on its way. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has expired.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Madam President, I move to table the amendment of the \ndistinguished Senator from California, and I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays are ordered.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. It is my understanding we have 10 minutes equally divided \nto wrap up amendments or statements before we go to the vote.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3079\n\n    (Purpose: To provide that monitoring requirements imposed on a \n     substantial number of public water systems be established by \n                              regulation)\n\n  Mr. CHAFEE. I have one last amendment, Madam President, that I send \nto the desk and ask for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Rhode Island [Mr. Chafee], for himself, \n     Mr. Kempthorne, Mr. Baucus, and Mr. Reid, proposes an \n     amendment numbered 3079.\n\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 132, line 5, strike ``methods.'' and insert \n     ``methods. Information requirements imposed by the \n     Administrator pursuant to the authority of this subparagraph \n     that require monitoring, the establishment or maintenance of \n     records or reporting, by a substantial number of public water \n     systems (determined in the sole discretion of the \n     administrator), shall be established by regulation as \n     provided in clause (ii).''.\n\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Madam President, this amendment tightens up EPA's \ninformation-gathering authorities under the law. The amendment would \nrequire EPA to impose new monitoring reporting or record-keeping \nrequirements only by rule of a public comment if those requirements \nwould effect a substantial number of public water systems.\n  This amendment has been cleared on both sides. We are prepared to \nadopt it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there any further debate?\n  The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 3079) was agreed to.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I move to lay it on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                        source water protection\n\n  Mr. KOHL. Madam President, as all the managers of this bill are \nacutely aware, an emergency outbreak of the parasite cryptosporidium in \nMilwaukee in 1993 resulted in the deaths of over 100 citizens and \ncaused nearly 400,000 others to become severely ill. I believe that \nmany provisions included in this legislation will be helpful in \nprotecting future generations from the threat of cryptosporidium and \nother microbial contaminants, and I thank the managers for that.\n  Certainly the Milwaukee outbreak has demonstrated the need for strong \nsource water protection programs. In fact, the State of Wisconsin has \none of the most respected sources water protection programs in the \nNation. However, even with that program, the Milwaukee cryptosporidium \noutbreak occurred. Although the Wisconsin Priority Watershed Program is \nprimarily a voluntary program, working in a cooperative manner with \nlandowners in targeted watersheds, the program does have the authority \nto enforce against the small minority of landowners in a targeted \nwatershed who refuse to cooperate with the commonsense conservation \nefforts of their neighbors.\n  While I know that it is the intention of the managers to create a \nnew, Source Water Quality Protection Partnership Program which is \nvoluntary in nature, I want to be able to assure the citizens of my \nState that the Wisconsin Priority Watershed Program will not be \ndiscriminated against in S. 1316, as a result of having an enforcement \nauthority.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. I completely understand the concerns of the Senator from \nWisconsin, and I agree that the Wisconsin Priority Watershed Program is \none of the most outstanding water quality programs in this country. In \nthat context, I want to assure the Senator that S. 1316 in no way \ndiscriminates against the Wisconsin program, or any other State \nprogram, on the basis of that program's enforcement authority. While \nStates choosing to participate in the new Source Water Quality \nProtection Partnership Program are required to use the voluntary \napproach, other sections of the bill would provide programs like \nWisconsin's Priority Watershed Program access to funding from the State \nrevolving fund. States that choose the Source Water Quality Protection \nPartnership approach are also authorized to use SRF funding.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I concur in the response made by the Senator from Rhode \nIsland. This bill does not discriminate against State or local programs \nthat include enforcement authority, it merely sets up a different \nframework. Both purely voluntary programs, as well as programs like the \nWisconsin Priority Watershed Program, are authorized to use funding \nfrom the State's SRF allocation through state administration of a \n\n[[Page S 17772]]\nsource water quality protection program.\n  Mr. KOHL. I thank the managers for this clarification and for working \nwith me on this important matter.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I, too, am pleased that this bill contains a \nrequirement for the development of a national standard for \ncryptosporidum. Several times this Congress, I have raised the issue \nthat the cryptosporidum outbreaks are no longer Milwaukee's problem, \nbut the country's problem, and that there should be action to ensure \nthat enforceable national requirements are developed. However, relative \nto the bill's provisions that create a new petition program for \nvoluntary sourcewater protection, I share the concerns of the senior \nSenator from Wisconsin, [Mr. Kohl].\n  I want to be certain that Wisconsin is not penalized for the actions \nit has already taken to protect source water. As mentioned by the \nsenior Senator from Wisconsin [Mr. Kohl] our State's efforts to protect \nsource waters from contaminated runoff centers around the Wisconsin \nNonpoint Source Water Pollution Abatement Program, often referred to as \nthe priority watershed program based upon its watershed approach to \ncontrolling polluted runoff. The program provides grants to local units \nof government in urban and rural watersheds, which reimburse up to 70 \npercent of costs associated with installing best management practices. \nBy the end of 1994, the State has been actively engaged in 67 projects, \nincluding 4 large-scale and 3 lake initiatives, and more than 82 large-\nscale projects are eligible to participate in the program.\n  Our State's program follows an extensive land use inventory and water \nresource appraisal process, and public participation is a critical \ncomponent of the program. By in large participation has been voluntary, \nbut the State does retain the authority to require participation after \nthe protection plan is developed.\n  I concur in the importance of assuring that this bill allows \nWisconsin's current program to access the SRF and appreciate the \nstatements made by the floor managers to that effect.\n\n\n                           stage i rulemaking\n\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Madam President, I would like to clarify the application \nof the new standard setting authorities established by the bill to the \nstage I rulemaking for disinfectants and disinfection byproducts that \nEPA has proposed.\n  The use of chlorine to kill pathogenic organisms in drinking water \npresents a real challenge. On the one hand, disinfection of public \nwater supplies is a public health miracle. One of the witnesses at our \nhearings on this bill called it the single most important public health \nadvance in history. On the other hand, the use of chlorine as a \ndisinfectant may produce chemical byproducts in the water that present \nother health risks.\n  EPA has proposed a rule for disinfectants and disinfection byproducts \nthat attempts to balance these risks. The proposed rule was developed \nthrough a regulatory negotiation that included representatives of local \ngovernments, water agencies and water supply districts, and public \ninterest groups. EPA used this approach because current law does not \ncontain explicit authority to balance risks in the way that EPA has \nproposed to do in this rulemaking. Presumably, one reason for the \nnegotiation was to avoid a subsequent court challenge to the rule.\n  Now, we are changing the law and we are including explicit authority \nfor the Administrator to take a risk balancing approach where it is \nappropriate. These changes would authorize EPA to issue the type of \nrule that has been proposed in stage I for disinfection byproducts. But \nin passing this bill, we face a delicate legislative task. We want to \nendorse the risk balancing approach that EPA is taking and make it \nclear that the statute as amended authorizes such a rule--including the \nstage I rule--but we don't want these new statutory provisions to \ndisturb the negotiated agreement that is incorporated in the rule that \nEPA has proposed.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. I would ask the distinguished chairman of the \nEnvironment and Public Works Committee whether the bill would prevent \nEPA from modifying the proposed rule. If new information indicates that \nthe stage I rule as proposed does not strike an appropriate balance \namong the competing health risks, could EPA modify the rule when it is \npromulgated?\n  Mr. CHAFEE. It is my understanding that the agreement negotiated by \nthe parties to the disinfection byproducts rulemaking does provide that \nthe final stage I rule may include modifications if new information \nwarrants those changes. The bill does not preclude changes that are \nwithin the scope of the agreement.\n  However, these new standard setting authorities are not to be the \nbasis for making changes in the rule as it was proposed, nor was it our \nintent to require the Administrator to repropose the stage I proposed \nrule to conduct additional risk balancing under new section 1412(b)(5). \nHowever, if subsequent to enactment, someone should discover an \ninconsistency, the bill specifically precludes a change in the proposed \nrule to resolve that inconsistency. Furthermore, the bill insulates the \nrule from a court challenge on the basis of any inconsistency, should \none be found. We do not intend to disrupt the results of the \nnegotiation.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. The committee report at page 38 says that the bill does \nnot apply to the stage I rulemaking because that rule has already been \nproposed in a detailed form. Does the Senator's statement affect that \npart of the committee report?\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Yes. The purpose of this statement is to establish that \nin one sense the new authority contained in section 1412b(5) does apply \nto the stage I rulemaking.\n  As I said, we are attempting a delicate legislative task here. We are \nchanging the statute to provide EPA with explicit authority to set \nstandards that balance risks. But we do not want the detailed \nprovisions of this new authority to upset a specific rule of that type \nthat has recently been proposed. We want to make clear that EPA is \nauthorized by the Safe Drinking Water Act, as it is amended by this \nbill, to issue the stage I rule. If this bill is enacted and the stage \nI rule is promulgated as it was proposed, no one could bring a court \nchallenge against the rule on the grounds that it wasn't authorized by \nthe statute.\n  At the same time, the stage I rule is not to be tested against the \nspecific provisions of the statute to determine whether it is \nconsistent in every respect. it may not be. So long as the final stage \nI rule stays within the parameters of the agreement negotiated by the \nparties, it is authorized by the statute as amended.\n  The bill applies to the stage I rule because EPA is given general \nauthority to issue a rule that is consistent with the negotiated \nagreement; but the specific provisions of the risk balancing \nauthorities in the new subsection 1412(b)(5) are not to be applied by \nEPA or by the courts in determining whether the final rule is in \naccordance with the law. That determination is to be based on the \nagreement that was signed by the parties to the negotiation.\n  Nothing in this bill affects the applicability of new subsection \n1412(b)(5) to the stage II rulemaking on disinfection by products.\n  Madam President, that completes everything on this side. I inform all \nSenators, immediately following the vote on the motion to table the \nBoxer amendment, we will then go to final passage.\n  I ask, if proper, for the yeas and nays on final passage at this \ntime.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Madam President, the delay here is we are waiting a \npossible additional colloquy with the distinguished Senator from \nNebraska.\n  Madam President, how much time of the 10 minutes is left?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There are 5 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. If the Senator from California wished that minute, this \nis the time, if she would like.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3078\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Madam President, I will take advantage of that one moment \nto simply say what we are trying to do in this amendment is to give \nsupport to the public health community, which says it is very \nimportant. We have the support of EPA and the American Public Health \nAssociation, and a number of other organizations, that \n\n[[Page S 17773]]\nconsumers have a right to know, just once a year, what is in their \nwater.\n  It is not something we feel is burdensome. As a matter of fact, we \nsay the EPA has to issue regulations that make it simple. The \nDemocratic leader is supporting this. Senator Lautenberg is supporting \nthis. Senator Kohl, whose State had a terrible outbreak of \ncryptosporidium and lost lives, is supporting it. We think this is \nextremely reasonable. It is not an unfunded mandate. Governors can opt \nout of this. Small water systems can opt out of this. The large water \nsystems serve 83 percent of our people.\n  We think this is a solid amendment and we urge a ``no'' vote on the \nmotion to table.\n  I yield the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There are 4 minutes remaining. Is there \nfurther debate?\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Madam President, while we are preparing several \ncolloquies to submit for the Record, I will take this brief opportunity \nto thank everybody involved. Particularly, I thank the distinguished \nchairman of the subcommittee, Senator Kempthorne, for his splendid work \non this. He has really been a tower of strength and the leader of this \nwhole effort.\n  Also, I thank the ranking member, Senator Baucus, and Senator Reid, \nthe ranking member of the subcommittee, and all the staff for their \nwonderful work. I particularly thank Jimmie Powell on this side, who \nreally was very, very effective.\n\n\n                     public water system definition\n\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Some questions have arisen about how section 24(b) of \nthe bill, which amends the definition of public water systems, applies \nto certain irrigation systems. As the committee report explains, the \nprovision is intended to address a narrow set of situations, such as \nthe one that was involved in the Imperial Irrigation court decision, \nwhere an irrigation system is knowingly providing drinking water to a \nlarge number of customers. However, it is my understanding that the \nprovision does not apply to irrigation systems that only intend to \nprovide water for such purposes as irrigation and stock watering, and \ndo not intend that water be withdrawn for drinking water use.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I agree with Senator Kempthorne's interpretation. In the \narid west, where irrigation systems may cover vast distances, it would \nbe unfair and impractical to treat an irrigation system as a public \nwater system just because a number of people withdraw water for \ndrinking water use without the permission or knowledge of the system, \nand I do not believe that the provision applies to such situations.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Does the manager of the bill share this view.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Yes. The Safe Drinking Water Act defines a public water \nsystem as a system for the provision to the public of piped water for \nhuman consumption, if such system has at least 15 service connections \nor regularly serves at least 25 individuals. In describing a public \nwater system, EPA's regulations and guidance use such terms as \n``serves'' and ``delivers,'' usually in the context of ``customers.'' \nThese terms are clearly contrary to a situation where the irrigation \nsystem does not either consent to having water withdrawn for human \nconsumption, or know that such withdrawals are occurring with respect \nto the requisite number of connections or customers.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Questions also have arisen about how the new \nprovision would apply to irrigation systems that provide water to \nmunicipal drinking water systems, which then treat the water and \nprovide it to customers for human consumption. Would these irrigation \nsystems be treated as public water systems on this basis?\n  Mr. CHAFEE. No. Under the new provision, a connection is not \nconsidered, for purposes of determining whether an entity is a public \nwater system, if the water is treated by a pass-through entity to \nachieve a level of treatment equivalent to the level provided by \napplicable drinking water regulations. In the case you describe, the \nmunicipal water system would be providing such treatment, and the \nirrigation system's provision of water to the municipal water system \nwould not be considered a connection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Madam President, I commend the floor manager, Senator \nChafee, for his efforts, not only during the months that it took us to \nget here but for his demeanor today on the floor. I also thank Senator \nBaucus, the other floor manager of this very important legislation, and \nSenator Reid, for this legislation that is going to be well received by \nall the States and municipalities throughout the United States and \ntheir constituents.\n  I thank the staffs of Senator Baucus and Senator Reid and the staff \nof Senator Chafee: Jimmie Powell and Steve Shimberg; and acknowledge my \nstaff, Meg Hunt, Ann Klee, and Buzz Fawcett, and thank all the Senators \nwho participated today, in their suggestions or debate, for their \nimprovements to the bill.\n  I look forward to what is about to happen, which is we are going to \nastound our families by voting on final passage of this at a relatively \nearly hour. Then I suggest all Senators go home, have supper with their \nfamilies, and raise a toast of safe drinking water to what we have \naccomplished today.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. We have no need for further time, Madam President.\n\n\n                       Vote on Amendment No. 3078\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has expired.\n  The question now occurs on the motion to table the amendment offered \nby the Senator from California, amendment No. 3078.\n  The yeas and nays have been ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

(The confidential list \nof EURATOM storage facilities covered by the Agreement is being \ntransmitted directly to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and the \nHouse International Relations Committee.) I am also pleased to transmit \nmy written approval, authorization and determination concerning the \nagreement, and the memorandum of the Director of the United States Arms \nControl and Disarmament Agency with the Nuclear Proliferation \nAssessment Statement concerning the agreement. The joint memorandum \nsubmitted to me by the Secretary of State and the Secretary of Energy, \nwhich includes a summary of the provisions of the agreement and other \nattachments, including the views of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, \nis also enclosed.\n  The proposed new agreement with EURATOM has been negotiated in \naccordance with the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended by the \nNuclear Non-Proliferation Act of 1978 (NNPA) and as otherwise amended. \nIt replaces two existing agreements for peaceful nuclear cooperation \nwith EURATOM, including the 1960 agreement that has served as our \nprimary legal framework for cooperation in recent years and that will \nexpire by its terms on December 31 of this year. The proposed new \nagreement will provide an updated, comprehensive framework for peaceful \nnuclear cooperation between the United States and EURATOM, will \nfacilitate such cooperation, and will establish strengthened \nnonproliferation conditions and controls including all those required \nby the NNPA. The new agreement provides for the transfer of nonnuclear \nmaterial, nuclear material, and equipment for both nuclear research and \nnuclear power purposes. It does not provide for transfers under the \nagreement of any sensitive nuclear technology (SNT).\n\n  The proposed agreement has an initial term of 30 years, and will \ncontinue in force indefinitely thereafter in increments of 5 years each \nuntil terminated in accordance with its provisions. In the event of \ntermination, key nonproliferation conditions and controls, including \nguarantees of safeguards, peaceful use and adequate physical \nprotection, and the U.S. right to approve retransfers to third parties, \nwill remain effective with respect to transferred nonnuclear material, \nnuclear material, and equipment, as well as nuclear material produced \nthrough their use. Procedures are also established for determining the \nsurvival of additional controls.\n  The member states of EURATOM and the European Union itself have \nimpeccable nuclear nonproliferation credentials. All EURATOM member \nstates are party to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear \nWeapons (NPT). EURATOM and all its nonnuclear weapon state member \nstates have an agreement with the International Atomic Energy Agency \n(IAEA) for the application of full-scope IAEA safeguards within the \nrespective territories of the nonnuclear weapon states. The two EURATOM \nnuclear weapon states, France and the United Kingdom, like the United \nStates, have voluntary safeguards agreements with the IAEA. In \naddition, EURATOM itself applies its own stringent safeguards at all \npeaceful facilities within the territories of all member states. The \nUnited States and EURATOM are of one mind in their unswerving \ncommitment to achieving global nuclear nonproliferation goals. I call \nthe attention of the Congress to the joint U.S.-EURATOM ``Declaration \non Non-Proliferation Policy'' appended to the text of the agreement I \nam transmitting herewith.\n  The proposed new agreement provides for very stringent controls over \ncertain fuel cycle activities, including enrichment, reprocessing, and \nalteration in form or content and storage of plutonium and other \nsensitive nuclear materials. The United States and EURATOM have \naccepted these controls on a reciprocal basis, not as a sign of either \nParty's distrust of the other, and not for the purpose of interfering \nwith each other's fuel cycle choices, which are for each Party to \ndetermine for itself, but rather as a reflection of their common \nconviction that the provisions in question represent an important norm \nfor peaceful nuclear commerce.\n  In view of the strong commitment of EURATOM and its member states to \nthe international nonproliferation regime, the comprehensive \nnonproliferation commitments they have made, the advanced technological \ncharacter of the EURATOM civil nuclear program, the long history of \nextensive transatlantic cooperation in the peaceful uses of nuclear \nenergy without any risk of proliferation, and the fact that all member \nstates are close allies or close friends of the United States, the \nproposed new agreement provides to EURATOM (and on a reciprocal basis, \nto the United States) advance, long-term approval for specified \nenrichment, retransfers, reprocessing, alteration in form or content, \nand storage of specified nuclear material, and for retransfers of \nnonnuclear material and equipment. The approval for reprocessing and \nalteration in form or content may be suspended if either activity \nceases to meet the criteria set out in U.S. law, including criteria \nrelating to safeguards and physical protection.\n  In providing advance, long-term approval for certain nuclear fuel \ncycle activities, the proposed agreement has features similar to those \nin several other agreements for cooperation that the United States has \nentered into subsequent to enactment of the NNPA. These include \nbilateral U.S. agreements with Japan, Finland, Norway and Sweden. (The \nU.S. agreements with Finland and Sweden will be automatically \nterminated upon entry into force of the new U.S.-EURATOM agreement, as \nFinland and Sweden joined the European Union on January 1, 1995.) Among \nthe documents I am transmitting herewith to the Congress is an analysis \nby the Secretary of Energy of the advance, long-term approvals \ncontained in the proposed U.S. agreement with EURATOM. The analysis \nconcludes that the approvals meet all requirements of the Atomic Energy \nAct.\n\n  I believe that the proposed agreement for cooperation with EURATOM \nwill make an important contribution to achieving our nonproliferation, \ntrade and other significant foreign policy goals.\n  In particular, I am convinced that this agreement will strengthen the \n\n\n[[Page S 17775]]\ninternational nuclear nonproliferation regime, support of which is a \nfundamental objective of U.S. national security and foreign policy, by \nsetting a high standard for rigorous nonproliferation conditions and \ncontrols.\n  It will substantially upgrade U.S. controls over nuclear items \nsubject to the current U.S.-EURATOM agreement as well as over future \ncooperation.\n  I believe that the new agreement will also demonstrate the U.S. \nintention to be a reliable nuclear trading partner, and thus help \nensure the continuation and, I hope, growth of U.S. civil nuclear \nexports to EURATOM member states.\n  I have considered the views and recommendations of the interested \nagencies in reviewing the proposed agreement and have determined that \nits performance will promote, and will not constitute an unreasonable \nrisk to, the common defense and security. Accordingly, I have approved \nthe agreement and authorized its execution and urge that the Congress \ngive it favorable consideration.\n  Because this agreement meets all applicable requirements of the \nAtomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended, for agreements for peaceful \nnuclear cooperation, I am transmitting it to the Congress without \nexempting it from any requirement contained in section 123 a. of that \nAct. This transmission shall constitute a submittal for purposes of \nboth sections 123 b. and 123 d. of the Atomic Energy Act.

A bill to direct the Secretary of Energy to establish a \nsystem for defining the scope of energy research and development \nprojects, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Energy and \nNatural Resources.\n\n\n    defining the scope of energy research and development projects \n                              legislation\n\n Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, at a time in which we are trying to \nreduce the deficit and improve the efficiency of government, we should \nnot be funding research and development projects that are ill defined \nand poorly managed because of a lack of direction and purpose. We \nshould not be providing Federal dollars to any program in which it is \nnot clear how the American public will benefit from its investment. It \nonly stands to reason that if the private sector will not fund efforts \nin which there is not some return on its investment, the Federal \nGovernment should not either.\n  Furthermore, we should not be funding efforts that the private sector \nshould be funding because of its huge payoff to the private sector and \nminimal payoff to the American public. If there is shared benefits to \nbe realized by both, then the effort should be cost shared between the \ntwo.\n  The Department of Energy spends approximately $7 billion a year on \nresearch and development activities. They cover a wide range of science \nand engineering issues in the energy field. Any savings due to an \nimprovement in the efficiency and the effectiveness of the management \nsystem will amount to several millions of dollars.\n  Mr. President, I am introducing a bill that will begin to address \nthis issue. The bill will require the Secretary of Energy to establish \na project definition system for research and development projects in \nwhich projects costs are expected to exceed $1 million.\n  It is expected that by requiring this project definition system prior \nto funding any project, costly revisions in project plans and \ndirections may be avoided. The project definition document, the product \nof the project definition system, will provide the foundation by which \nmore detailed project plans can be developed. It is expected that this \nsystem will also further ensure that the Department is not funding \nprojects that are not addressing a known problem.\n  The bill identifies a number of issues or questions to be resolved \nprior to the funding of a project. Included are such things as project \ncost, duration, future users or beneficiaries, cost sharing, and \nexpected outcome.\n  However, also included in this list is the criteria to be used to \ndetermine the end of the project or the end of Government funding. For \nmany years, Government-sponsored projects have gone on for years \nwithout any clear end in sight. They have consumed years of funding \nwith little or no benefit for continuation. By having this criteria \nestablished at the beginning of the project, this practice will be \nstopped. With this stoppage of Government support, any cost-sharing \npartners may continue with the project if they decide to do so.\n  Mr. President, I feel this bill takes a step in the right direction \nof ensuring that our public resources are invested wisely and \nresponsibly. I feel that if the Department can invest a little more \ntime, more money, at the beginning of these expensive research and \ndevelopment projects, it can avoid some of the costly type of mistakes \nthat it has made in the past--mistakes due to ill-defined projects and \nlack of proper planning.\n  I look forward to further discussions with my colleagues on how to \nfurther improve this bill. I hope my colleagues will join me in \nsupporting this bill as we debate the future of the Department of \nEnergy and work to eliminate projects that can and should be undertaken \nby the private sector, we should at the very least seek ways to ensure \na direction and efficiency in the projects we do undertake.\n      By Mr. THOMAS (for himself, Mr. Dole, Mr. Domenici, Mr. Simpson, \n        Mrs. Kassebaum, Mr. Faircloth, Mr. Thompson, and Mr. Cochran):\n\n  S. 1434. A bill to amend the Congressional Budget Act of 1974 to \nprovide for a 2-year--biennial--budgeting cycle, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on the Budget and the Committee on \nGovernmental Affairs, jointly, pursuant to the order of August 4, 1977, \nwith instructions that if one committee reports, the other committee \nhas 30 days to report or be discharged.\n\n\n                   THE BIENNIAL BUDGETING ACT OF 1995\n\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a bill that \ncreates a biennial budgeting cycle. It seems to me it is particularly \nappropriate to do that now. We have spent almost this entire year \ndealing with the budget. Surely it has been an unusual budget year in \nthat we are attempting to make some changes, fundamental changes, in \ndirection. But it is not otherwise unusual. As a matter of fact, since \n1977, there have been 55 continuing resolutions, which would indicate \nwe need to change the budgeting process. I am joined in this effort by \na number of Senators originally and hope to have more: Senator Dole, \nSenator Domenici, Senator Simpson, Senator Kassebaum, Senator \nFaircloth, Senator Thompson and Senator Cochran.\n  There are a lot of things we ought to be doing. We ought to be \ndealing with health care. We have not finished that problem. We ought \nto be dealing with regulatory reform. Most everyone agrees with that. \nTelecommunications, where we can deregulate and move forward with the \nthings that will create jobs and move us forward. Personally, I believe \nwe ought to be doing something with rangeland reform. Some of us live \nin States where 50 to 80 percent of the surface belongs to the Federal \nGovernment and is managed by the Federal Government. We need to change \nsome of those things. Foreign policy--we need to be involved more in \nforeign policy. I think we find ourselves drifting into situations \nwhere we need to make policy in certain places and the administration \nsays, gosh, we do not want to do that until we get an agreement, and \nthen, after we have an agreement, it is too late to talk about it. So, \nessentially, the Congress is outside of foreign policy. That is wrong. \nWe ought to be talking about endangered species, and a number of things \nthat need to be done. \n\n[[Page S 17777]]\n\n  Instead, Mr. President, as you know, we spend almost all our time \ndeciding on how we are going to fund the Government. Most States--the \nPresiding Officer, I think, in his State of Missouri, served as \nGovernor--have biennial budgets. There are a couple of advantages to \nthat, certainly. One of them is that it gives a little longer time for \nagencies to plan. Rather than every year, they have more tenure in \ntheir budgeting. They can plan longer. More important, I think, it \nallows the Congress, then, to have some time to do the other things, \none of which is oversight of the budget.\n  I suspect that the budget debate will not be over in this session of \nCongress until next year. I suspect in less than 2 months we will be \nmoving into another budget debate which consumes all of our time. I \nalready mentioned that since 1977 we have had 55 continuing \nresolutions. We have had too many repetitive votes. We are back on the \nsame thing over and over and over again without any new issue.\n\n  So there has not been, and continues not to be, enough time for \nvigorous oversight. I suspect one of the principal functions of the \nlegislative body ought to be oversight of the budgets that they have \napproved to ensure that they are, indeed, being spent as they were \ndesigned to be spent and to discover how they can be spent more \nefficiently and more effectively. That is one of the things we have had \nvery little time to do.\n  The provisions of this bill are rather simple. By the way, this is \nnot a new idea. This has been introduced a number of times, been \nconsidered and supported by many Members of this body. It creates a 2-\nyear authorization of appropriation and budget resolutions so that you \nset it out in a block and say here we are. It is not much more \ndifficult to do it for 2 years than 1. You simply have a block of 2 \nyears in which to do a budget. It is not difficult at all. All \nbudgetary activities would take place during the first session of \nCongress. So in the second session you would have a chance to go back \nand provide some oversight to what is being done with the money that \nhas been appropriated. Oversight in nonbudgetary matters would be taken \nup in the second session of Congress. There would be an opportunity to \ndo the kinds of policy things that the Congress is designed to do in \naddition to spending all of our time funding the Government. Benefits, \nof course, would promote timely action on the budget, and would \neliminate some of the redundancy. We need to do that. It would provide \nmore time for effective oversight in the off years, and it would help \nso that we can reduce the size of Government.\n  It would also reduce the number of times where there is potential for \nthe kinds of congressional-Presidential conflicts that arise so often \nas in the process now that arises. If would allow the budget to be \nadopted in the first year of the President's term, and in the first \nyear of the sessions of Congress so that new Congresses can implement \ntheir budget, and then have a year for oversight. It would encourage \nlonger-term planning in the agencies.\n  I think that is one of the keys to reducing the cost of Government. \nThere have been very many programs, of course, that need to be \nanalyzed, and that have to have applied to them priorities. Things need \nto be done much better--things that could be transferred to local \ngovernments, and closer to the people. Those things all are often a \nresult of oversight.\n  There is a good deal of support for this proposition, as there has \nbeen in the past--Citizens Against Government Waste, the Hudson \nInstitute, Concord Coalition, Cato Institute, Committee for Responsible \nFederal Budgeting--a 20-year history of legislative bipartisan support \nin this Congress supported by Presidents Bush and Reagan over the \nyears.\n  Mr. President, this is obviously not a cure-all. Budgets are \ndifficult. The allocation of money to activities is not easy, and it is \nterribly important. But I submit to you that it can be done as well in \n2-year blocks, and the results will be much better. The results will be \nmuch better for the operations of Congress. The results will be much \nbetter for the operations of Government.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. McCONNELL (for himself and Mr. Warner):\n  S. 1435. A bill to grant immunity from personal civil liability, \nunder certain circumstances, to volunteers working on behalf of \nnonprofit organizations and governmental entities; to the Committee on \nthe Judiciary.\n\n\n                      THE VOLUNTEER PROTECTION ACT\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, volunteer service has become a high-\nrisk venture. Our ``sue happy'' legal culture has ensnared those \nselfless individuals who help worthy organizations and institutions \nthrough volunteer service. And, these lawsuits are proof that no good \ndeed goes unpunished.\n  In order to relieve volunteers from these million dollar liability \njudgments, I am pleased to introduce the Volunteer Protection Act.\n  The litigation craze is hurting the spirit of voluntarism that is an \nintegral part of American society. From school chaperones to Girl Scout \nand Boy Scout troop leaders to good samaritan doctors and nursing home \naides, volunteers perform valuable services. And, these volunteers are \nbeing dragged into court and needlessly and unfairly sued. The end \nresult? Too many people pointing fingers and too few offering a helping \nhand.\n  So, this bill creates immunity from lawsuits for those volunteers who \nact within the scope of their responsibilities, who are properly \nlicensed or certified where necessary, and who do not cause harm \nwillfully and wantonly.\n  In addition to creating a Federal standard for volunteer protection, \nthe bill allows the States to add further refinements to the Federal \nstandard. This will give the States a degree of flexibility and it \nstrikes a balance between the federalism interest and the need to \nprotect volunteers from these lawsuits. If a State enacts one or more \nof these additional criteria, the State law will be consistent with the \nFederal standard:\n  A requirement that the organization or entity adhere to risk \nmanagement procedures, including the training of volunteers.\n  A requirement that the organization or entity be accountable for the \nactions of its volunteers in the same way that an employer is liable \nfor the acts of its employees.\n  An exemption from the liability protection in the event the volunteer \nis using a motor vehicle or similar instrument.\n  An exemption from the liability protection if the lawsuit is brought \nby a State or local official in accordance with State or local law.\n  A requirement that the liability protection applies only if the \nnonprofit organization or government entity provides a financially \nsecure source of recovery, such as an insurance policy, for those who \nsuffer harm.\n\n  I ask unanimous consent that a copy of the bill be printed in the \nRecord and Legal Backgrounder entitled, ``Unfair Lawsuits Threaten \nVolunteers'' as well as the American Tort Reform Association's ``A Few \nFacts About Volunteer Liability'' also be printed in the Record.\n  Mr. President, this bill is widely supported by those organizations \nwho rely on volunteers to provide important services to our \ncommunities. Some 150 organizations have endorsed this bill and I ask \nthat a list of the Coalition for Volunteer Protection be printed in the \nRecord.\n  I look forward to the Senate's consideration of this bill and to \nprompt passage. We cannot afford not to enact this legislation. Our \ncommunities are depending upon us.\n  There being no objection, the materials were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1435\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Volunteer Protection Act of \n     1995''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Congress finds and declares that--\n       (1) the willingness of volunteers to offer their services \n     is deterred by potential for liability actions against them \n     and the organizations they serve;\n       (2) as a result, many nonprofit public and private \n     organizations and governmental entities, including voluntary \n     associations, social service agencies, educational \n     institutions, and other civic programs, have been adversely \n     affected by the withdrawal of volunteers from boards of \n     directors and service in other capacities;\n       (3) the contribution of these programs to their communities \n     is thereby diminished, resulting in fewer and higher cost \n     programs \n\n[[Page S 17778]]\n     than would be obtainable if volunteers were participating; and\n       (4) because Federal funds are expended on useful and cost-\n     effective social service programs, many of which are national \n     in scope, depend heavily on volunteer participation, and \n     represent some of the most successful public-private \n     partnerships, protection of volunteerism through \n     clarification and limitation of the personal liability risks \n     assumed by the volunteer in connection with such \n     participation is an appropriate subject for Federal \n     legislation.\n       (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this Act is to promote the \n     interests of social service program beneficiaries and \n     taxpayers and to sustain the availability of programs, \n     nonprofit organizations, and governmental entities that \n     depend on volunteer contributions by reforming the laws to \n     provide protection from personal financial liability to \n     volunteers serving nonprofit organizations and governmental \n     entities for actions undertaken in good faith on behalf of \n     such organizations.\n\n     SEC. 3. PREEMPTION.\n\n       This Act preempts the laws of any State to the extent that \n     such laws are inconsistent with this Act, except that this \n     Act shall not preempt any State law that provides additional \n     incentives or protections to volunteers, or category of \n     volunteers.\n\n     SEC. 4. LIMITATION ON LIABILITY FOR VOLUNTEERS.\n\n       (a) Liability Protection for Volunteers.--Except as \n     provided in subsections (b) and (d), no volunteer of a \n     nonprofit organization or governmental entity shall be liable \n     for harm caused by an act or omission of the volunteer on \n     behalf of the organization or entity if--\n       (1) the volunteer was acting within the scope of his or her \n     responsibilities in the nonprofit organization or \n     governmental entity at the time of the act or omission;\n       (2) if appropriate or required, the volunteer was properly \n     licensed, certified, or authorized by the appropriate \n     authorities for the activities or practice in the State \n     undertaken within the scope of his or her responsibilities in \n     the nonprofit organization or governmental entity; and\n       (3) the harm was not caused by willful and wanton \n     misconduct by the volunteer.\n       (b) Concerning Responsibility of Volunteers With Respect to \n     Organizations.--Nothing in this section shall be construed to \n     affect any civil action brought by any nonprofit organization \n     or any governmental entity against any volunteer of such \n     organization or entity.\n       (c) No Effect on Liability of Organization.--Nothing in \n     this section shall be construed to affect the liability of \n     any nonprofit organization or governmental entity with \n     respect to harm caused to any person.\n       (d) Exceptions to Volunteer Liability Protection.--If the \n     laws of a State limit volunteer liability subject to one or \n     more of the following conditions, such conditions shall not \n     be construed as inconsistent with this Act:\n       (1) A State law that requires the organization or entity to \n     adhere to risk management procedures, including mandatory \n     training of volunteers.\n       (2) A State law that makes the organization or entity \n     liable for the acts or omissions of its volunteers to the \n     same extent as an employer is liable for the acts or \n     omissions of its employees.\n       (3) A State law that the limitation of liability does not \n     apply if the volunteer was operating a motor vehicle, vessel, \n     aircraft, or other vehicle for which the State requires the \n     operator or vehicle owner to possess an operator's license or \n     to maintain insurance.\n       (4) A State law that the limitation of liability does not \n     apply if the civil action was brought by an officer of a \n     State or local government pursuant to State or local law.\n       (5) A State law that the limitation of liability shall \n     apply only if the nonprofit organization or governmental \n     entity provides a financially secure source of recovery for \n     individuals who suffer harm as a result of actions taken by a \n     volunteer on behalf of the organization or entity. A \n     financially secure source of recovery may be an insurance \n     policy within specified limits, comparable coverage from a \n     risk pooling mechanism, equivalent assets, or alternative \n     arrangements that satisfy the State that the entity will be \n     able to pay for losses up to a specified amount. Separate \n     standards for different types of liability exposure may be \n     specified.\n\n     SEC. 5.

EFFECTIVE DATE.\n\n       This Act applies to any claim for harm caused by an act or \n     omission of a volunteer filed on or after the date of \n     enactment of this Act, without regard to whether the harm \n     that is the subject of the claim or the conduct that caused \n     the harm occurred before such date of enactment.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n\n                             American Tort Reform Association,\n\n                                                   Washington, DC.\n\n                          Volunteer Liability\n\n       In October 1983, Craig Fredborg celebrated his birthday by \n     climbing Box Springs Mountain, overlooking Riverside, \n     California. To his companions' horror, Fredborg slipped on a \n     boulder and plummeted some 90 feet, sustaining severe spinal \n     injuries.\n       Alerted that Fredborg lay helpless on the slope, Walter \n     Walker, now 54, and his son Kevin, 31, and teammates from the \n     volunteer Riverside Mountain Rescue Unit scrambled to aid a \n     physician and a paramedic in mounting a ticklish nighttime \n     helicopter evacuation. Over the last 30 years, the unit's \n     volunteers have saved hundreds of lives. But for their \n     troubles, the Walkers and the others involved in the \n     emergency mission were sued two years later by the victim, \n     who asked $12 million in damages, claiming that `reckless and \n     negligent' rescue techniques had caused him to become a \n     quadriplegic.\n       The lawsuit eventually was dropped. But not before the \n     Walkers lost a lot of hours from their family printing \n     business giving depositions and meeting with defense \n     attorneys provided them by the county sheriff's department. \n     Perhaps the most significant consequence of the suit, says \n     Walker, is that meticulous documentation and planning \n     procedures have been instituted in its wake to forestall \n     future liability claims. `Probably we were a little weak in \n     that,' he concedes. Nevertheless, he adds, `It definitely has \n     slowed us down in getting the team into the field . . . \n     Concern about liability exposure has complicated how we look \n     at every mission.'

Weber, ``A Thousand Points of \n     Fright?'', Insurance Review, February 1991.\n       A man who was high on LSD was rescued by a student, after \n     he had jumped from a 30 foot dockside bar into a seven foot \n     pool of water. The man suffered a broken neck and was left \n     paralyzed for life. However, he subsequently sued both the \n     school and the student. The judge eventually threw the case \n     out, but unfortunately, this is just another prime example of \n     a waste of tax payers money.--Mississippi Press, May 2, 1993.\n       ``Amateur referees at softball diamonds, high school \n     stadiums and college field houses are finding that their \n     decisions can trigger major-league lawsuits.''

Cople III) \\1\\\n\n       Volunteer service is under assault from an unlikely \n     quarter--the civil justice system. Like so many others, \n     volunteers and their service organizations have been swept \n     into the courts to face potential liability in civil suits. \n     Under the rule of law, our actions are judged by common \n     standards of conduct. This provides the basis for the courts \n     to recognize rights and afford remedies to those who claim to \n     be aggrieved. But civil justice should not be used recklessly \n     to inhibit beneficial conduct that may involve some amount of \n     risk. In order for volunteer service to survive and prosper, \n     the civil justice system must find an equilibrium under which \n     it recognizes and protects personal and property rights \n     without stifling the volunteer spirit so necessary to a vital \n     and self-reliant community.\n     \\1\\ William J. Cople III is a partner with the Washington, \n     D.C. law firm of Spriggs & Hollingsworth and serves pro bono \n     as the General Counsel of the National Capital Area Council \n     of the Boy Scouts of America.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n       Efforts to achieve this balance have been hindered by the \n     civil justice system itself. Both federal and state courts \n     seem to be trapped in a disturbing pattern of recognizing \n     novel rights and enlarging the scope of existing rights in an \n     effort to redress a multitude of real and perceived wrongs \n     and injuries. The courts have regrettably found rights, and \n     corresponding remedies, to exist in cases involving \n     grievances that are trivial or mundane and in cases where \n     acts or omissions were not previously understood to be a \n     legal wrong. In other cases, judges and juries have found \n     serious injuries and other matters of grave concern to \n     deserve recompense, even though the legal duty was uncertain \n     or the causal connection to the harm was attenuated.\n       As a result, the value of rights that historically have \n     been recognized in the courts as a proper subject of redress \n     has been debased by according them respect no greater than \n     the most tenuous rights now being recognized. Moreover, the \n     expansion of potential liability may diminish desirable and \n     beneficial conduct, such as the willingness to serve as a \n     volunteer. In the past, the courts seem to have understood \n     that some circumstances, even ones of tragic proportion, are \n     simply caused by accident or misfortune, and not necessarily \n     by culpable conduct on the part of any other person. Yet, \n     this now has become an unacceptable conclusion. Every \n     conceivable circumstance in which we deal and interact with \n     each other seems to create a victim. This has spawned the \n     civil litigation clogging the courts, as every victim of \n     circumstances seeks compensation by shifting the blame for \n     those circumstances to someone else.\n       An unfortunate effect of this civil litigation is to \n     heighten the risks of volunteer service. In thousands of \n     service organizations, volunteers give freely of their time \n     and effort to support activities that they believe to be \n     worthwhile for a host of personal reasons. This is done \n     without expectation of compensation or other remuneration of \n     any kind. Nonetheless, many volunteer organizations have been \n     forced by the growing threat of civil litigation to purchase \n     and maintain liability insurance or other forms of legal \n     indemnity covering volunteers for their services.\n       Even with insurance coverage, the increasing risk of \n     litigation no doubt has a chilling effect on the willingness \n     and enthusiasm of volunteers to donate their time and effort. \n     Many volunteers may think twice before becoming involved, \n     while others may continue to participate, but curtail their \n     services to those activities that seem relatively risk-free. \n     Still others may cease to be a volunteer, out of an abundance \n     of caution and justifiable aversion to being caught up in \n     civil litigation. Quantifying the effects of increased risk \n     of civil liability on volunteer service will have to await \n     empirical evidence. It is fair to say, however, that \n     volunteers themselves have become victims of the civil \n     justice system. The increasing propensity to enlarge the \n     universe of rights and award compensation, often in stunning \n     amounts, may be to the detriment of volunteer service.\n       This danger was illustrated recently in a personal injury \n     lawsuit brought against volunteers serving a local council of \n     the Boy Scouts of America. In a case brought in Oregon state \n     court, Powell v. Boy Scouts of America, et al., a youth \n     seriously injured in an activity sponsored by Scouting sued \n     the Boy Scouts and its adult volunteers for negligence.\n       The Boy Scouts of America is a national volunteer service \n     organization, chartered by the U.S. Congress in 1916, \n     pursuant to 36 U.S.C. Sec. Sec. 21-29. Acting primarily \n     through its volunteers, the Boy Scouts is dedicated to the \n     training of youth in accordance with long-established \n     Scouting ideals and principles. Id. Sec. 23. The Boy Scouts \n     operates \n\n[[Page S 17780]]\n     through several hundred local Scout councils. Community organizations \n     within each Council, including churches, schools, and civic \n     groups, among others, conduct Scouting programs and \n     activities. The availability of these programs and activities \n     depends upon individual volunteers willing to devote \n     considerable time and effort in providing adult supervision \n     for participating Scouts. These volunteers provide their time \n     and resources to support the Council and the local \n     organizations. They not only develop and plan the Scouting \n     activities, but also raise the funds in the community \n     necessary to support them. Without these volunteers, the Boy \n     Scouts would be deprived of its principal resource for \n     carrying out its national charter as a youth service \n     organization.\n       In the Powell case, several adults in Portland, Oregon \n     volunteered to supervise an outing of the Sea Explorers, a \n     Scouting unit in the Boy Scouts' Cascade Pacific Council. In \n     a tragic accident, one of the young men participating in the \n     Sea Explorer outing suffered a paralyzing injury in a rough \n     game of touch football. The injured youth, who was 16 years \n     of age at the time of the accident, broke his neck during the \n     football game and is now quadriplegic. At least one of the \n     adult volunteers apparently knew that the boys were throwing \n     a football around, but neither observed the game in which the \n     boy was injured.\n       Based on this incident, the injured youth filed a personal \n     injury lawsuit against the Boy Scouts and the Columbia \n     Pacific Council (predecessor to Cascade Pacific Council) in \n     Multnomah County Circuit Court, Oregon. The suit alleged that \n     the youth's injury was foreseeable and preventable, and that \n     the Boy Scouts and its volunteers negligently failed to \n     supervise him adequately during the Sea Explorer outing.\n       The Court dismissed the original lawsuit, evidently based \n     on an insufficient nexus between the Boy scouts and the \n     youth's injury. Subsequently, the injured young man filed his \n     personal injury lawsuit directly against two of the adult \n     volunteers who participated in the Sea Explorer outing. \n     Following trial, an Oregon jury entered a verdict against the \n     two adult volunteers, finding them liable for some $7 \n     million. In one of the largest monetary verdicts in Oregon, \n     the jury awarded $4.89 million dollars for future care and \n     lost earnings plus $2.14 million dollars for pain and \n     suffering. In accordance with Oregon state law, the amount of \n     the verdict will be reduced by the proportionate negligence, \n     approximately one-third, that the jury assigned to the \n     injured youth for his own negligent conduct. The Oregon \n     Circuit Judge presiding at trial also reduced the amount \n     awarded by the jury for pain and suffering to $500,000, \n     reflecting a statutory limit on non-economic damages that may \n     be awarded in personal injury suits in Oregon.\n       The Oregon jury's verdict in this case against the Sea \n     Explorer adult volunteers brings the civil justice dilemma \n     into striking focus. The case was born of a tragic accident \n     in which a young man's life and future were forever changed \n     by a debilitating permanent injury. But this tragedy may have \n     been compounded, not alleviated, by finding culpability and \n     imposing liability on the adult volunteers under \n     circumstances suggesting an enlargement of the volunteers' \n     legal duty. The jury seemingly held the volunteers to a \n     standard of care requiring them constantly to supervise the \n     youth entrusted to their charge, even for activities which \n     under other circumstances may routinely be permitted without \n     such meticulous oversight.\n       Any parent entrusting their children to the care and \n     supervision of another should expect and demand that all \n     reasonable and prudent care be taken in discharging that \n     responsibility. However, this does not mean that this duty of \n     care must be carried out in such an extraordinary manner that \n     only constant supervision of the youth in their care, \n     regardless of age and other factors, will suffice for \n     volunteers to satisfy their legal responsibility. Certainly, \n     the circumstances surrounding tragic incidents should be \n     carefully examined. All relevant facts and circumstances \n     should be given due weight and consideration in judging \n     whether an adult volunteer has adequately met the \n     responsibility to supervise a child entrusted to his care. \n     But circumstances will nonetheless occur where senseless \n     tragedies happen without anyone being legally to blame. As in \n     the case of other legal duties, adequate supervision should \n     mean reasonable and prudent conduct as required under the \n     circumstances as they existed at the time. Organizations \n     serving the youth in our community, as well as those \n     fulfilling other beneficent purposes, should not be forced \n     into the role of guaranteeing a safe harbor free of all risk. \n     Likewise, neither should volunteers be held a standard that \n     may be infeasible, or even unattainable.\n       To choose otherwise would mean that the civil justice \n     system needs to resolve every mishap and inexplicable tragedy \n     by identifying someone to bear legal responsibility for a \n     victim of those circumstances. This may, or may not, have \n     happened in the case of the Multnomah County Circuit Court \n     jury's verdict against the Scout volunteers. But the \n     circumstances of the case, and the available evidence that \n     has been reported, seem to suggest that the jury overreached \n     in an effort to assign blame.\n       As is the case of the Oregon verdict against the Sea \n     Explorer volunteers, there are a great many cases involving \n     injury to person, property, or other rights, which are \n     anything but trivial. In fact, their dimensions may be so \n     tragic that such cases motivate judges or juries to find \n     fault and assign blame where it might otherwise hesitate and \n     decline to do so. The judgments entered in such cases, \n     however, have other serious consequences. They obscure the \n     standards of conduct under which we should expect to comport \n     ourselves. This expectation of being able to determine, \n     before we act, whether we are engaging in conduct that is \n     right or wrong is a critical component to civil justice. \n     Moreover, when civil litigation affords redress to every \n     injury, regardless of whether the circumstances justify it \n     under the rule of law, those rights that are long established \n     and highly prized are commensurately demeaned. If virtually \n     every injury is entitled to compensation, then the most \n     important rights become lost in the sea of compensable \n     grievances that the courts recognize. Finally, we need to \n     underscore that a legal judgment entered in a single case can \n     have a multitude of consequences extending far beyond that \n     case itself. This surely is a reason for concern in the case \n     of volunteers to service organizations.\n       The Boy Scouts afford their volunteers certain insurance \n     liability coverage or other indemnity for their acts or \n     omissions that may occur in the course of providing services \n     as a Scouting volunteer. This coverage is far from unlimited. \n     Similarly, other youth service and charitable organizations \n     may also be able to provide such insurance coverage for their \n     volunteers, but still others may not. Even with insurance \n     coverage available, many of the most talented and energetic \n     volunteers may eschew volunteer service, fearing that their \n     good intentions will buy themselves a lawsuit. This is a \n     particularly invidious effect, which is difficult to measure \n     and even harder to correct. Existing and prospective \n     volunteers may refuse to participate in many organizations \n     out of a genuine concern with accepting an unreasonable risk \n     of potential liability. Volunteers who might otherwise be \n     motivated to serve may be deterred from doing so based solely \n     on this concern for liability.\n       The Supreme Court of the United States aptly characterized \n     the problem in Parratt v. Taylor 451 U.S. 527, 101 S. Ct. \n     1908 (1981). In Parratt, a prisoner, who lost his mail order \n     hobby materials when normal procedures for receipt of mail \n     packages were not followed, brought a federal civil rights \n     case for the alleged deprivation of a Constitutional right. \n     In its decision in that case, the Court seemed to forewarn \n     the civil justice system that not every wrong is entitled to \n     redress as a violation of Constitutional rights because \n     ``[i]t is hard to perceive any logical stopping place for \n     such a line of reasoning.'' Id. at 544. The Court's \n     observation, though made in the context of a civil rights \n     suit more than ten years ago, is equally salient today. The \n     civil justice system should not recognize a legal right for \n     every victim of circumstances. The rule of law should be used \n     to define our standards of conduct and promote consistency \n     and reasonable expectations in their application. The case \n     involving the Sea Explorer volunteers in Oregon serves to \n     reveal a truth. Despite the best of intentions, when misused \n     or used in unpredictable ways, the civil justice system ends \n     up serving no one, least of all those who volunteer.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. LAUTENBERG:\n\n  S. 1436. A bill to amend the Federal Water Pollution Control Act to \nallow certain privately owned public treatment works to be treated as \npublicly owned treatment works, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on the Environment and Public Works.\n\n\n THE MUNICIPAL WASTEWATER TREATMENT FACILITY PRIVATE INVESTMENT ACT OF \n                                  1995\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I rise to introduce the Municipal \nWastewater Treatment Private Investment Act. This bill will remove an \nimpediment to private investment in municipal wastewater treatment \nfacilities and in doing so, will improve water quality, provide \nincreased fiscal flexibility to local governments, and create jobs.\n  Mr. President, our Nation's waters are a priceless resource. They \nprovide recreational opportunities, habitat for fish and wildlife, and \ndrinking water among other uses. But we cannot assure our citizens that \nour waterways will be clean unless we have adequate wastewater \ntreatment facilities.\n  And our wastewater treatment needs are staggering. According to the \n1992 EPA National Needs Survey, it will cost the United States $112 \nbillion to build necessary wastewater treatment facilities. My State of \nNew Jersey's wastewater treatment needs alone are $4.759 billion. This \nincludes close to $2 billion for wastewater treatment plants necessary \nfor compliance with the Clean Water Act and an estimated $1.29 billion \nto reduce discharges of bacteria, garbage and other floatable debris, \nand other untreated waste from combined sewer overflows. The remaining \nneeds are to construct new sewers and repair existing sewers.\n  Federal dollars are necessary but insufficient to build these \nfacilities. The \n\n[[Page S 17781]]\nSenate VA/HUD appropriations bill includes $1.5 billion for State \nrevolving loan funds. This funding level alone is insufficient to pay \nthe costs local communities will have to bear to comply with the Clean \nWater Act. In addition, State revolving loan assistance will have to \naddress other water quality needs such as storm water and nonpoint \nsource pollution.\n  Local communities are looking increasingly to privatization of local \ngovernmental programs as a way to pay for these programs. This is an \nobvious way for them to minimize the costs associated with Federal \nrequirements, which are eating into their budgets. And the Federal \nGovernment should do everything possible to assist these efforts.\n  In 1992, President Bush issued Executive Order 12803, which made it \neasier for local governments to privatize facilities that have received \nFederal financing--including wastewater treatment facilities. EPA \nAdministrator Carol Browner has expressed her support to continue these \nefforts. In a letter she wrote to Mr. Edward Limbach, vice president of \nthe American Water Works Co. in Voorhees, NJ, Ms. Browner said:\n\n       [W]e need to provide communities the opportunity to work \n     more closely with the private sector in financing \n     environmental infrastructure. Local officials are in the best \n     position to develop capital financing structures that meet \n     their particular needs. We find that communities throughout \n     the Nation are taking the lead in ``reinventing government'' \n     and acknowledging the ability of private capital to enhance \n     public investment. The EPA is committed to supporting these \n     communities and allowing them flexibility in financing the \n     infrastructure systems needed to achieve the environmental \n     protection our citizens demand.\n\n  EPA has an initiative underway to encourage private investment in \nwastewater treatment facilities.\n  I urge the Congress to join with the administration in providing \nflexibility to local officials struggling to address the wastewater \nneeds of this country. One problem identified by EPA which requires \nlegislation concerns the phrase ``publicly owned treatment works'' or \n[POTWs]. This is the phrase used in the Clean Water act to identify \nwhat we all know to be municipal sewage facilities. Under the act, \nPOTWs, treating municipal waste, are required to provide a level of \ntreatment known as secondary treatment. However, if a private company \noffered to provide the same municipal waste services to the same \ncommunity, it would have to meet a different treatment standard only \nbecause it is not a publicly owned treatment work.\n  Mr. President, the level of waste- water treatment should be based on \nthe quality of the receiving water, or a national technology standard--\nit should not turn on the tax status of the owner of the sewer pipe.\n  My bill would define publicly owned treatment works to include waste- \n water facilities which are privatized or jointly owned by public and \nprivate partners. The legislation would remove the uncertainty \nregarding the environmental standards governing privately owned \nwastewater treatment facilities providing municipal wastewater \nservices. It would require the same environmental standards for \nmunicipal wastewater treatment facilities owned in whole or in part by \nprivate investors as would apply to publicly owned treatment works. \nCommunities and their citizens should not face an additional burden \nimposed by the Federal Government simply because they are developing \ninnovative means to pay for a clean environment.\n  This bill would have numerous positive benefits. Perhaps most \nimportantly, it would lead to more construction of wastewater treatment \nfacilities. According to a report done by NatWest Washington Analysis, \npotential private investment in municipal wastewater treatment \nfacilities could reach $2 billion a year. This would double the Federal \ninvestment in wastewater facilities.\n  To the extent that this investment is in new facilities, there will \nbe more treatment facilities and cleaner water. The legislation also \nwould help private capital flow into wastewater systems facing \nupgrades, expansions and new requirements.\n  Under the legislation, private and public/private facilities would \nhave to comply with all of the same requirements that publicly owned \nfacilities must comply with. Industrial facilities discharging into \nsewers and treatment plants, whether public or private, would continue \nto be subject to the pretreatment requirements of the Clean Water Act.\n  The legislation also will lead to additional jobs. According to a \nstudy prepared by Apogee Research, every $1 billion spent on wastewater \nfacility investment generates 34,200 to 57,400 jobs.\n  The bill also would mean more capital investment to protect and \nprolong the extensive Federal investment in existing structures.\n  Privatization gives local governments which must comply with the \nClean Water Act an additional fiscal tool for construction and \nmaintenance of these facilities. It provides equitable treatment of \ncommunities that choose to pursue alternative financing on their own \nrather than depending on limited Federal funds.\n  Mr. President, this bill will help the private sector provide the \ninfrastructure financing which is essential for economic growth. It \nwill give local governments with limited financial resources another \ntool to address their budgetary problems. It will generate jobs. And it \nwill improve the quality of the Nation's waters.\n  This proposal is endorsed by the National Association of Water \nCompanies, the National Council for Public-Private Partnership, the \nUtility and Transportation Contractors Association of New Jersey, the \nNational Utility Contractors Association, and the Water and Wastewater \nEquipment Manufacturers Association.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be included in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1436\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Municipal Wastewater \n     Treatment Facility Private Investment Act of 1995''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds that--\n       (1) municipal wastewater treatment construction needs \n     exceed $100,000,000,000;\n       (2) Federal assistance for State revolving loan programs \n     will provide funding for only a portion of the municipal \n     wastewater treatment facilities;\n       (3) increasing the amount of funds invested by the private \n     sector in municipal wastewater treatment facilities would--\n       (A) help address the funding shortfall referred to in \n     paragraph (2);\n       (B) stimulate economic growth;\n       (C) lead to an increase in the construction of wastewater \n     treatment facilities and jobs;\n       (D) result in a cleaner environment; and\n       (E) provide a greater degree of fiscal flexibility for \n     local governments in meeting Federal mandates; and\n       (4) the most effective way to encourage an increase in the \n     level of involvement of the private sector in the provision \n     of municipal wastewater services is to provide for the \n     uniform regulation of municipal wastewater treatment plants \n     without regard to whether the wastewater treatment plants are \n     publicly or privately owned or under the control of a public \n     and private partnership.\n\n     SEC. 3.

Mr. President, I am pleased to rise today, along with \nmy able colleague Senator Simon, to introduce the Diabetes Research \nAct. Diabetes is a chronic, and often fatal, disease affecting more \nthan 14 million Americans. Billions of dollars are spent annually to \ncare for those afflicted by this disease. It is the fourth leading \ncause of death in the United States and a major cause of kidney \ndisease, heart disease, amputation, and adult blindness. Scientists \ntell us that medical research holds a cure for diabetes, yet the \nproblem persists.\n  In February of this year, I attended the Capitol Summit on Diabetes \nResearch where leading scientists from around the Nation presented a \ncomprehensive plan to direct diabetes research to a cure by the turn of \nthe century. Recent evidence indicates that we are on the verge of \nuncovering new prevention, screening, and treatment procedures that \nwill dramatically improve diabetes therapy and lead to a cure in the \nvery near future.\n  The bill I am introducing today will substantially increase the funds \navailable to the National Institutes of Health for diabetes research. I \nbelieve that at this critical juncture in the fight to end diabetes, it \nis imperative that we provide additional funding to our scientists who \nare on the verge of finding a cure. Every year, over $100 billion is \nspent caring for the 14 million citizens suffering with the \ncomplications of this devastating disease. This bill increases the \nauthorization by $315 million for diabetes research. In light of the \nemotional and financial burden that diabetes brings to our country, I \nbelieve that this bill represents a prudent, invaluable investment in \nour Nation's future. I urge my colleagues to join me in cosponsoring \nthis critical legislation so that we can end diabetes, and end the pain \nthat this disease brings to its sufferers and their loved ones.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of this bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1437\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Diabetes Research Act of \n     1995''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       The Congress finds as follows:\n       (1) Diabetes is a serious health problem in America.\n       (2) More than 14,000,000 Americans suffer from diabetes.\n       (3) Diabetes is the fourth leading cause of death in \n     America, taking the lives of 162,000 people annually.\n       (4) Diabetes disproportionately affects minority \n     populations, especially African-Americans, Hispanics, and \n     Native Americans.\n       (5) Diabetes is the leading cause of new blindness, \n     affecting up to 39,000 Americans each year.\n       (6) Diabetes is the leading cause of kidney failure \n     requiring dialysis or transplantation, affecting up to 13,000 \n     Americans each year.\n       (7) Diabetes is the leading cause of nontraumatic \n     amputations, affecting 54,000 Americans each year.\n       (8) The cost of treating diabetes and its complications are \n     staggering for our Nation.\n       (9) Diabetes accounted for health expenditures of \n     $105,000,000,000 in 1992.\n       (10) Diabetes accounts for over 14 percent of our Nation's \n     health care costs.\n       (11) Federal funds invested in diabetes research over the \n     last two decades has led to significant advances and, \n     according to leading scientists and endocrinologists, has \n     brought the United States to the threshold of \n     revolutionary discoveries which hold the potential to \n     dramatically reduce the economic and social burden of this \n     disease.\n       (12) The National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and \n     Kidney Diseases supports, in addition to many other areas of \n     research, genetic research, islet cell transportation \n     research, and prevention and treatment clinical trials \n     focusing on diabetes. Other research institutes within the \n     National Institutes of Health conduct diabetes-related \n     research focusing on its numerous complications, such as \n     heart disease, eye and kidney problems, amputations, and \n     diabetic neuropathy.\n\n     SEC. 3. NATIONAL INSTITUTES OF HEALTH; INCREASED FUNDING \n                   REGARDING DIABETES.\n\n       With respect to the conduct and support of diabetes-related \n     research by the National Institutes of Health--\n       (1) in addition to any other authorization of \n     appropriations that is available for such purpose for the \n     fiscal year involved, there are authorized to be appropriated \n     for such purpose such sums as may be necessary for each of \n     the fiscal years 1996 through 2000; and\n       (2) of the amounts appropriated under paragraph (1) for \n     such purpose for a fiscal year, the Director of the National \n     Institutes of Health shall reserve--\n       (A) not less than $155,000,000 for such purpose for the \n     National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney \n     Diseases; and\n       (B) not less than $160,000,000 for such purpose for the \n     other national research institutes.\n\n  Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, during this National Diabetes Awareness \nMonth, I am pleased to join my colleague Senator Strom Thurmond in \nintroducing the Diabetes Research Act of 1995, a bill to authorize \nincreased funding for diabetes research. It is identical to legislation \nintroduced in the House earlier this year by Representative Elizabeth \nFurse and Representative George R. Nethercutt, Jr.\n  Information from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and \nKidney Diseases shows there has been a dramatic increase recently in \nthe number of Americans with diabetes--almost a 50 percent increase \nsince 1983. About 15 million Americans now have diabetes, and an \nestimated half of them do not know they have the disease.\n  Diabetes is one of the leading causes of death by illness in the \nUnited States. It can lead to blindness, kidney failure, heart disease, \nstroke, and nerve damage. And it affects minority groups two to three \ntimes more frequently than others.\n  The rapid increase is taking place primarily in type II diabetes--\nadult-onset diabetes--which makes up 95 percent of cases. This type of \ndiabetes is usually diagnosed at age 51, and with increasing numbers of \nAmericans in this age range, we can expect an even higher incidence of \ndiabetes in the future.\n  The diabetes-related costs to the Nation each year are estimated at \nover $100 million. And each day, thousands of Americans are facing \nblindness, amputation of extremities, and heart disease as a result of \nthe disease.\n  We need to make research in this area a priority, and that is the \npurpose of the $315 million increase in NIH funding in this bill. The \ngood news is, diabetes research is making great strides, and additional \neffort has an excellent chance of providing breakthrough results, \nsaving thousands of lives, improving the lives of millions more and \nsaving billions of health care dollars.\n  I invite my colleagues' support for this legislation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url":

Mr. President, I have sought recognition to speak \nin support \n\n[[Page S 17787]]\nof the Interstate Commerce Commission Sunset Act of 1995 (S. 1396), \nwhich provides for the orderly transfer of the residual functions of \nthe Interstate Commerce Commission to an independent Intermodal Surface \nTransportation Board within the Department of Transportation.\n  Pennsylvania is a rail-dependent State, and both shippers and \nrailroads are in agreement that there should be no regulatory gap \nbetween the Commission and its successor agency during which no agency \nof the Federal Government has jurisdiction to enforce the Interstate \nCommerce Act. The fiscal year 1996 Transportation appropriations bill, \nH.R. 2002 (Pub. L. No. 104-50), provides no funding for the Commission \neffective December 31, 1995, making passage of the sunset legislation \nand a prompt House-Senate conference necessary to avoid disruption in \nthe rail industry.\n  I am pleased to note that the managers' amendments included language \nthat I have worked on and supported, which is designed to ensure that \nthis legislation maintains the balance between the rights and remedies \nof carriers and shippers incorporated into the Staggers Rail Act of \n1980, which provided new market freedoms to this industry. Several \nprovisions in the reported bill could be interpreted as reregulating \ncertain aspects of the railroad industry. These provisions, if left \nuntouched, could undermine the Staggers Act reforms, which have worked \nwell for both shippers and railroads. Therefore, I wish to thank \nChairman Pressler, the distinguished Senator from South Dakota, and \nSenator Exon, the ranking minority member, who have worked closely with \nme, Senator Santorum, Senator Mack, and other Senators, in a bipartisan \nmanner to finalize language that maintains a deregulated environment \nfor our vital railroad industry as we streamline Government and provide \nfor an orderly transition from the Interstate Commerce Commission to \nthe Intermodal Surface Transportation Board.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/11/29/senate-section/article/S17786-2", "month": "11", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "29", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S17787]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 LAST RESPECTS TO PRIME MINISTER RABIN\n\n Mr. SIMON.

I \n     want to talk about my grandfather.\n       You always awake from a nightmare, but since yesterday \n     (Sunday) I was continually awakening to a nightmare. It is \n     not possible to get used to the nightmare of life without \n     you. The television never ceases to broadcast pictures of \n     you, and you are so alive that I can almost touch you--but \n     only almost, and I won't be able to anymore.\n       Grandfather, you were the pillar of fire in front of the \n     camp and now we are left in the camp alone, in the dark; and \n     we are so cold and so sad.\n       I know that people talk in terms of a national tragedy, and \n     of comforting an entire nation, but we feel the huge void \n     that remains in your absence when grandmother doesn't stop \n     crying.\n       Few people really knew you. Now they will talk about you \n     for quite some time, but I feel that they really don't know \n     just how great the pain is, how great the tragedy is; \n     something has been destroyed.\n       Grandfather, you were and still are our hero. I wanted you \n     to know that every time I did anything, I saw you in front of \n     me.\n       Your appreciation and your love accompanied us every step \n     down the road, and our lives were always shaped after your \n     values. You, who never abandoned anything, are now abandoned. \n     And here you are, my ever-present hero, cold, alone, and I \n     cannot do anything to save you. You are missed so much.\n       Others greater than I have already eulogized you, but none \n     of them ever had the pleasure I had to feel the caresses of \n     our warm, soft hands, to merit your warm embrace that was \n     reserved only for us, to see your half-smile that always told \n     me so much, that same smile which is no longer, frozen in the \n     grave with you.\n       I have no feelings of revenge because my pain and feelings \n     of loss are so large, too large. The ground has been swept \n     out from below us, and we are groping now, trying to wander \n     about in this empty void, without any success so far.\n       I am not able to finish this; left with no alternative. I \n     say goodbye to you, hero, and ask you to rest in peace, and \n     think about us, and miss us, as down here we love you so very \n     much. I imagine angels are accompanying you now and I ask \n     them to take care of you, because you deserve their \n     protection.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/11/29/senate-section/article/S17787-1", "month": "11", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "29", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S17787-S17788]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  MARINE CORPS ANNIVERSARY OBSERVANCE\n\n Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I attended the Marine Corps \nAnniversary Observance at the Marine Corps War Memorial. The speaker at \nthose ceremonies was our colleague from New Hampshire, Bob Smith. As a \nformer marine, I was very impressed with Senator Smith's remarks, and I \nask that they be printed in the Record for all--Marines and those who \nwish they were--to read.\n  The remarks follow:\n\n       Remarks of Senator Bob Smith--Marine Corps 220th Birthday\n\n       Thank you very much, General Krulak. Secretary Perry, \n     Secretary Dalton, General Shalikashvili, Senator Warner, \n     Colonel Dotter, and distinguished guests. It is a great honor \n     to join with you all today in commemorating the 220th \n     birthday of the United States Marine Corps. Before we begin, \n     I want to take this opportunity to commend you personally, \n     General Krulak, on the superb readiness of your troops, and \n     for your outstanding leadership as commandant of the Marine \n     Corps.\n       It is fitting that today's commemoration coincides with the \n     observance of Veterans Day. Indeed, as our Nation pauses to \n     reflect upon the historical sacrifices of its warriors, what \n     better place for us to congregate that here at this great \n     shrine. What better way to honor our Nation's veterans than \n     to celebrate 220 years of Marine Corps history.\n       As you know, I was not a marine. However, I took my share \n     of ``incoming'' on the floor of the U.S. Senate fighting the \n     battle for those M1A1 tanks and MPS ships, and I am proud of \n     it. I am a marine in spirit, and I have a letter from General \n     Mundy to prove it.\n       The Marine Corps was created on November 10, 1775 when the \n     Continental Congress decreed that two battalions of Marines \n     be organized under the direction of Captain Samuel Nicholas, \n     the first commandant.\n       Recruitment procedures being somewhat different back then, \n     the Marines were recruited at Tun Tavern in Philadelphia. \n     Although their indoctrination was not quite as rigorous as a \n     trip through San Diego, Parris Island, or Quantico, these \n     pioneering Marines made history by launching an amphibious \n     landing at New Providence Island in the Bahamas, capturing a \n     British fort and securing its arms and powder for \n     Washington's Army. They later went on to fight at such \n     locations as Trenton, Morristown. Penobscot Bay, and Fort \n     Mifflin.\n       In the two centuries since those colonial battles, the size \n     and structure of the Marine Corps has evolved, doctrine has \n     changed, and areas of operational responsibility have \n     expanded. The corps has emerged as a truly global force, \n     deploying to Central and South America, Europe, Asia, and the \n     Middle East, with the status of being the first to fight.\n       But what has never changed, and what continues to \n     distinguish the United States Marine Corps from any other \n     fighting force in the world, is its unique culture and \n     character.\n       The Marine Corps is rich with tradition, its men and women \n     strong on character and conviction. Honor discipline, valor, \n     and fidelity are the corps virtues; dedication, sacrifice, \n     and commitment its code. To those who willingly join this \n     elite society, service is not merely an occupation, it is a \n     way of life. Once a marine, always a marine.\n       It is this way of life, this absolute, unwavering \n     commitment to duty, honor, and country, that has \n     distinguished the United States Marine Corps from every other \n     fighting force in history. And it is this selfless \n     dedication, manifested through uncountable examples of \n     battlefield valor, that has preserved our freedom and enabled \n     our nation to prosper.\n       But there have been costs. Tremendous costs. Look at the \n     costs of Iwo Jima. Between February 19th and March 26th 1945, \n     nineteen-thousand Americans were wounded \n\n[[Page S 17788]]\n     and seven thousand were killed in the campaign to capture that \n     strategic four mile island. Against tremendous adversity, our \n     marines persevered and prevailed in this critically important \n     campaign. Four of the men depicted in this memorial died \n     within days of raising the flag.\n       But those of us who have served in the Armed Forces and \n     gone to war know that freedom is never free. We knew it when \n     we enlisted, we know it today. So many of our brave soldiers, \n     sailors, airmen, and marines have perished in defense of \n     freedom. So many more have been wounded or disabled. Each of \n     us has suffered the loss of a fallen comrade or loved one.\n       This veterans day has a very special significance for me. \n     For it was 50 years ago that I lost my father on active duty \n     during World War II. He was a naval aviator who flew combat \n     missions in the South Pacific.\n       He knew the risks, he knew them well. And he accepted them. \n     The stakes were too high not to. My father gave his life in \n     service to his Nation. And on this very special occasion, \n     when I am so honored to join with you today, I want to pay \n     tribute to my father and mother who, together, rest on a \n     quiet little hillside in Arlington Cemetery. Like my dad, my \n     mother never wavered in her love of country, even when she \n     saw her only two sons depart for Vietnam.\n       Freedom is never free.\n       But some things are worth fighting for. Some universal \n     principles of freedom, of morality, of human dignity, and of \n     right and wrong must be defended, no matter what the costs. \n     And through thick and thin, the United States Marine Corps \n     has answered the Nation's call, remaining true to its \n     convictions and determined in its vow to be most ready when \n     the Nation is least ready.\n       Whether it be the colonial battles at new providence island \n     and Trenton, or the historic campaigns at Belleau Wood, \n     Guadalcanal, Iwo Jima, and Inchon, the marines have always \n     delivered for our Nation for the cause of freedom.\n       And today, whether rescuing American citizens in Rwanda, \n     maintaining the watch off Somalia, conducting migrant rescue \n     and security operations in the Caribbean and ashore in \n     Jamaica, Cuba, and Haiti, responding to crises in the Persian \n     gulf, or rescuing downed pilots in Bosnia, the Marine Corps \n     continues to deliver on its commitment to the American people \n     and the United States Constitution. They even survived the \n     media onslaught when they landed in Somalia.\n       When I think back upon the uncountable acts of heroism and \n     sacrifice by our marines, I am always reminded of the words \n     of Admiral Chester Nimitz following the battle of Iow Jima.\n       From the fleet, Admiral Nimitz concluded, and I quote, \n     ``Among the Americans who served on Iwo Island, uncommon \n     valor was a common virtue.'' Unquote.\n       Let me briefly provide an example of the kind of valor to \n     which Admiral Nimitz was referring. On February 23, 1945, a \n     young marine corporal named Hershel Williams earned the \n     Congressional Medal of Honor at Iwo Jima. When marine tanks \n     were unable to open a lane for the infantry through a network \n     of concrete pillboxes and buried mines, Corporal Williams \n     struck out on his own to suppress the Japanese onslaught.\n       Corporal Williams fought desperately for 4 hours, covered \n     by only 4 riflemen, preparing demolition charges and using a \n     flamethrower to wipe out multiple enemy positions.\n       On one occasion, he daringly mounted a pillbox under heavy \n     fire, inserting the nozzle of his flamethrower through the \n     air vent, and destroying the enemy guns that were ravaging \n     our troops.\n       According to the Medal of Honor description, Corporal \n     Williams' unyielding determination and extraordinary heroism \n     in the face of ruthless enemy resistance were directly \n     instrumental in neutralizing one of the most fanatically \n     defended Japanese strongholds, enabling his company to reach \n     its objective.\n       This is the kind of uncommon valor that Admiral Nimitz was \n     talking about. But one does not have to reach back into \n     history to find heroism. It is right here in front of, and \n     around me, today. The highest decorations that our Nation \n     bestows are worn on the chest of many of you here today. It \n     is you who carry the torch of freedom, and you who continue \n     the legacy of Corporal Williams and the millions of other \n     marines who have served our Nation. And you do it willingly, \n     sometimes without receiving the credit you so richly deserve.\n       Though the world remains dangerous, and the future \n     uncertain, there is one constant that we as Americans can \n     take great pride and comfort in. That is the fact that our \n     United States Marine Corps remains on station, throughout the \n     world, 24 hours a day, 365 days a year, every year, defending \n     our freedom and preserving our security.\n       The honor, the dedication, the sacrifice, and, yes, the \n     uncommon valor of every marine who has served before lives on \n     through those of you who stand watch today. As we honor this \n     history, we should pause to reflect upon the 275 Marine Corps \n     soldiers who are still listed as POW/MIA from Vietnam, Korea, \n     and other wars. They are always in our hearts.\n       I know that my friends in the Navy, Army, and Air Force \n     will understand when I take the liberty of saying to General \n     Krulak and all members of the Marine Corps--past, present and \n     future--Semper fi.\n       Thank you very much.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/11/29/senate-section/article/S17787-2", "month": "11", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "29", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S17788-S17789]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  CHINA-UNITED STATES TIES WARM A BIT AS CHINA-TAIWAN RELATIONS CHILL\n\n  Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, I have felt for some time that the United \nStates made a mistake in recognizing the People's Republic of China and \nderecognizing Taiwan, sometimes referred to as the Republic of China.\n  My position for a long time was that we should recognize both Chinas, \nas we recognized both Germanys. That did not prevent East Germany and \nWest Germany from uniting as one country.\n  But when the mistake was made of playing the China card, in large \nmeasure in response to the Soviet Union and its perceived threat, we \nhad set up a situation that potentially could mean military trouble in \nAsia.\n  The New York Times carried a story on Saturday, November 18, by \nPatrick E. Tyler that talks about an improvement in United States ties \nbut a worsening of China-Taiwan ties.\n  I am concerned about any leadership that could emerge in dictatorial \nChina that might be a threat to the free Government of Taiwan.\n  I hope that our military leaders and our diplomatic leaders will not \npussyfoot around in making clear that there would be serious \nrepercussions if China were to invade Taiwan.\n  I ask that the article be printed in the Record.\n  The article follows:\n\n       China-U.S. Ties Warm a Bit as China-Taiwan Relations Chill\n\n                         (By Patrick E. Tyler)\n\n       Beijing, Nov. 17.--China and the United States made new \n     progress today in resuming a program of high-level military \n     contacts by agreeing to an exchange of visits of their top \n     military officers next year.\n       But American defense officials visiting here this week \n     reported that during private conversations they encountered \n     trenchant rhetoric and signs of unrelenting determination by \n     Beijing's military and civilian leaders to undermine the rule \n     of the President of Taiwan, Lee Teng-hui.\n       In recent days, China has restated its intention to use all \n     means, including military intimidation and force if \n     necessary, to end what Beijing considers a drive by Mr. Lee \n     to achieve independence for Taiwan.\n       Mr. Lee insists he is only seeking greater international \n     recognition for the island, which has been estranged from the \n     mainland since the nationalists fled there after their defeat \n     by the Communists in 1949.\n       As three days of talks ended, the Pentagon was receiving \n     reports that China had begun a new military exercise off its \n     southeastern coast near Taiwan, military officials here said.\n       It followed a Taiwanese drill earlier in the week intended \n     to demonstrate the island's ability to repulse an invasion \n     from the mainland.\n       The visit of the American delegation led by Joseph S. Nye, \n     the Assistant Secretary of Defense for International Security \n     Affairs, was the first by American military officials since \n     the diplomatic rift that followed a White House decision to \n     allow Mr. Lee to make a private visit to the United States in \n     June.\n       And it demonstrated that United States-China relations are \n     recovering at a time of unremitting military tension across \n     the Taiwan Strait that could lead to another rupture in \n     relations and, perhaps, military conflict.\n       ``The Chinese have a military operation starting right \n     now,'' an official traveling with Mr. Nye said tonight. ``And \n     what is clear is that China is brushing off military plans \n     and operational contingencies that they haven't thought about \n     since the 1950's. This is an issue we are very concerned \n     about.''\n       Mr. Nye and officials traveling with him said that \n     communication between China and the United States is \n     improving in some areas, but ``there was no give whatsoever'' \n     on Taiwan, one official said.\n       ``Every single person referred to Taiwan, and their point \n     was that every Chinese is united on this question,'' the \n     official said.\n       ``It was interesting because they made a comparison with \n     our system. They said you may have differences in your \n     Congress, but in China we are all united that there is only \n     one China and Taiwan is part of China.''\n       Chinese military leaders, during extensive closed door \n     talks with the American delegation, engaged in ``subtle \n     exploration'' of how the United States would respond in the \n     event of a military crisis over Taiwan, one official said.\n       But the American officials refused to discuss United States \n     contingency planning. ``We stand for peaceful resolution of \n     disputes across the Taiwan Strait,'' Mr. Nye said at a news \n     conference today.\n       Any use of force by China against Taiwan ``would be a \n     serious mistake'' and, he added, continued military exercises \n     near Taiwan ``are not helpful.''\n       Mr. Nye announced that the Chinese Defense Minister, Gen. \n     Chi Haotian, would visit Washington next year and that Gen. \n     John \n\n[[Page S 17789]]\n     Shalikashvili, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, would pay a \n     reciprocal visit to Beijing.\n       Visits by American and Chinese warships to each other's \n     ports will also resume, Mr. Nye said.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/11/29/senate-section/article/S17788-1", "month": "11", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "29", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S17789]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    CHARITABLE GIVING PROTECTION ACT\n\n Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, I am pleased to be a cosponsor of \nS. 978, the Charitable Giving Protection Act of 1995, introduced by \nSenators Hutchison and Dodd.\n  Charitable organizations serve a vital and unique role in meeting the \nneeds of the American people. Religious, educational, benevolent, \nfraternal, and other charitable organizations depend on donations to \nfund their operations. Congress must see to it that charitable giving \nis encouraged to ensure that these critical donations continue.\n  Charitable gift annuities enable individuals to make a donation to \ncharity and receive lifetime interest payments based on the donation's \nreturn. The SEC has determined that these types of donations do not \ninvolve an investment strategy and thus are not securities that would \notherwise have to be registered.\n  Recently, however, a lawsuit has put into question whether charitable \nincome funds need to be registered under the Federal securities laws. \nThe threat of litigation would deter individuals from making this type \nof donation and prevent charitable organizations from raising funds in \nthis manner. S. 978 will allow charitable institutions to continue \nraising vital funds through special investments and charitable gift \nannuities--without the threat of litigation.\n  The Charitable Giving Protection Act clarifies that the charitable \nincome funds are not required to register under the Federal securities \nlaws. This legislation would codify the long-standing SEC practice of \nexempting charitable organizations from registration requirements.\n  This legislation maintains critical investor protection provisions of \nthe Federal securities laws. It does not exclude charitable \norganizations from the antifraud or disclosure provisions of the \nFederal securities laws. These important investor provisions must be \nretained to protect individuals who make the donations to charitable \norganizations.\n  This legislation provides the appropriate relief to charities so they \ncan raise and manage their money without compromising investor \nprotections. The chief watchdog of the securities markets, the SEC, \nalso supports the goals of this legislation. During House Commerce \nCommittee hearings on a companion bill, the SEC's Director of the \nDivision of Investment Management, Barry Barbash, testified: ``the \nCommission believes that the Philanthropy Protection Act provides an \nappropriate level of investor protection while not encumbering \ncharitable organizations with the burdens of full compliance with the \nsecurities laws.''\n  I am pleased to be a cosponsor of S. 978. Last night, the House \ncompanion bills, H.R. 2145, the Philanthropy Protection Act and H.R. \n2525, the Charitable Gift Annuity Antitrust Relief Act of 1995 passed \nby a unanimous vote of the House of Representatives. I urge the Senate \nto act quickly on this important legislation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/11/29/senate-section/article/S17789-1", "month": "11", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "29", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S17789-S17790]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n     HONORING SHIM KANAZAWA, KINJI KANAZAWA, AND SPARK M. MATSUNAGA\n\n Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I would like to honor three \nextraordinary gifted individuals who share many things in common: love \nof country and an undying commitment to serve their fellow citizens. \nShim and Kinji Kanazawa and our beloved colleague, the late Spark M. \nMatsunaga are to be commended for the time, effort and many years of \noutstanding service that they have given to improving the quality of \nlife for the people of Hawaii. They are indeed role models that many \ncan only hope to emulate.\n  The eldest of 11 children of Torazo and Saki Rusaki, Shimeiji, or \nShim as she is more familiarly known, was born in Kamuela, HI. She \nattended schools in Waimea, Hilo, and Boston.\n  At the time when World War II broke out, Shim assisted the Swedish \nVice-Consulate, which had the responsibility for protecting the \ninterests of resident Japanese aliens. She advised the Vice-Consulate \nto provide a variety of services including assistance with business and \npersonal affairs, reuniting internees with their families, arranging \nfor transportation, and escorting many to the faraway camps. The \nAmerican Red Cross later awarded Shim a special citation for the care \nand compassion she displayed to those she assisted.\n  In 1946, while working for the Veterans Administration, Shim met her \nhusband, Kinji. The following year they were married and immediately \nmoved to Boston where Kinji attended law school and Shim studied at the \nChamberlain School of Design and Retailing. Upon completion of their \nstudies, they returned to Honolulu and Shim continued her work for the \nbetterment of the community.\n  Shim served as an active volunteer member of many organizations \nincluding the Lawyers Wives Club, for which she served as president, \nand the Commission on Children and Youth. Shim was the first nisei \nwoman to serve on the board of Aloha United Way, and the first woman \ndirector and chair to serve on the board of Kuakini Medical Center. She \nwas appointed by former Gov. William Quinn to chair the Life and Law \nCommittee to study laws affecting family life and youth, which \nspearheaded the creation of the Family Court. Shim actively \nparticipated on the Elder Affairs Policy Advisory Board and chaired the \nCommission on Aging. She was also the driving force in the planning of \nHawaii's participation in the White House Conference on Aging, serving \nas chair in 1981 and 1995, and for more than 10 years, Shim has been an \nactive board member of the Moiliili Community Center.\n  In 1990, on behalf of the Moiliili Hongwanji Mission, Shim applied \nfor a grant from the National Federation of Interfaith Volunteer \nCaregiver and founded Project Dana, which developed into a very \nsuccessful program of volunteer caregiving for the frail elderly. \nToday, she serves on the Robert Wood Johnson Faith in Action National \nAdvisory Committee and is a trustee/treasurer of the National \nFederation of Interfaith Volunteer Caregivers.\n  Shim's extraordinary efforts to care for and serve the community has \nearned her many honors. On May 13, 1990, the Board of Regents of the \nUniversity of Hawaii at Manoa bestowed upon her the honorary degree of \nHumane Letters for her deep concern and humanitarian efforts to improve \nthe quality of life for all people. On April 12, 1995, our State Senate \nhonored Shim for her devoted and exemplary service to the people of \nHawaii, and on May 11, 1995, the Public Schools Foundation honored her \nfor her more than 20 years of continuous service as a full time \nexecutive volunteer at the local and national level.\n  Kinji Kanazawa is the son of Sakijiro and Haru Kanazawa. He was born \nand raised in Moiliili with his twin brother Kanemi and five older \nsisters. Kinji attended Kuhio Elementary, Washington Intermediate, \nMcKinley High School, and the University of Hawaii at Manoa. Kinji \nworked in real estate, and during World War II, for the Federal War \nHousing Administration which built about 1,000 temporary homes in Manoa \nValley. After the war, he attended Boston University Law School.\n  Kinji headed the State Real Estate Commission, taught at the \nUniversity of Hawaii, and operated his own real estate school where he \ntrained over 6,000 agents. On April 3, 1995, he was duly admitted as an \nAttorney and Counselor of the Supreme Court of the United States of \nAmerica.\n  Kinji is credited with saving the Moiliili Community Center during \nWorld War II, when most Japanese-owned land was confiscated by the \nGovernment under martial law. The military governor refused to allow \nthe Moiliili Community Association to acquire the Japanese Language \nSchool unless the Japanese Board of Directors was replaced by \ncaucasians. Kinji persuaded several caucasian community leaders to \nbecome board members. As soon as the emergency was over, they willingly \nresigned to enable the former Moiliili leaders to become board members. \nKinji and I recently co-chaired the Capitol Fund Drive to construct the \nWeinberg Building which is now the Thrift Shop. He has continuously led \nthe board of trustees of the Moiliili Community Center for the past 50 \n\n[[Page S 17790]]\nyears. Kinji has also served the Moiliili Hongwanji Mission as the \npresident of the temple organization for over 22 years.\n  The late Spark M. Matsunaga was born on October 8, 1916, on the \nIsland of Kauai, to Kingoro and Chiyono Matsunaga, who had emigrated \nfrom Japan to work on a sugar plantation. He worked at many jobs \nthrough high school and graduated with honors from the University of \nHawaii, where he received a degree in education.\n  At the time World War II broke out, Spark was a second lieutenant in \nthe U.S. Army. When President Roosevelt permitted the formation of all-\nJapanese units, Spark became a member of the 100th Infantry Battalion, \nwhich later became a part of the 442nd Regimental Combat Team. Whatever \nassignments Spark received, he performed with skill and bravery. He \nfought in the historic battles of Monte Cassino, Anzio and the \nliberation of Rome. He was wounded twice and earned the Bronze Star \nMedal for heroism.\n  Using the GI bill, Spark went to Harvard Law School and received his \nlaw degree. He went to work as an assistant prosecuting attorney in \nHonolulu and was elected to the Territorial House of Representatives \nfrom 1954 to 1959, and serving as majority leader in 1959.\n  In 1962, Spark came to Washington and served in the U.S. House of \nRepresentatives for seven terms. In 1976, he was elected to the U.S. \nSenate. He served with much distinction as a member of the Finance \nCommittee, where he was a ranking member, and chairman of the \nSubcommittee on Taxation and Debt Management; on the Labor and Human \nResources Committee, and chairman of its Subcommittee on Aging; and on \nthe Veterans' Affairs Committee.\n  Spark will always be respected for his outstanding legislative record \nthat fulfilled his visions of peace, international cooperation, and \nassistance to those in need. He had always wanted to be remembered as a \nfriend of peacemakers. He never forgot the horrors of war. He was \ndetermined that our Nation would devote itself to the pursuit of peace. \nIn 1984, Spark's 22 years of lobbying efforts resulted in the \nestablishment of the U.S. Institute for Peace.\n  As a ranking member of the Veterans' Affairs Committee, Spark's \nimprint could be seen on virtually every major bill that passed the \ncommittee. In 1987, he engaged in efforts to establish a veterans \nmedical center in Hawaii, to care for the aging and ailing military \nveterans. At that time, I committed myself to carrying on Spark's \nendeavor and ask that the veterans hospital would forever bear his \nname, in remembrance of his contributions on behalf of our Nation's \nveterans. I am pleased to report today, the Congress has appropriated \napproximately one-third of the total funds to establish the Spark M. \nMatsunaga Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Center, and I remain \nhopeful that Spark's endeavor will someday become a reality.\n  Spark was indeed a voice of compassion for the homeless, as well as \nthe physically and mentally ill. When it may have been unpopular to do \nso, he waged a campaign for justice for Americans of Japanese ancestry \nwho were interned during World War II. Spark went from office to office \nseeking cosponsors for a measure authorizing an apology and monetary \nreparations for Japanese-Americans whose patriotism was questioned. \nThis measure was enacted in 1988.\n  I will always remember Spark for these achievements, his friendly \npersonality and love of Japanese poetry.\n  Shim and Kinji Kanazawa's and the late Spark M. Matsunaga's \nextraordinary lifelong contributions to the State of Hawaii and to our \nNation will not be forgotten.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/11/29/senate-section/article/S17789-2", "month": "11", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "29", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S17790-S17791]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   IMMIGRATION: WHERE TO GO FROM HERE\n\n Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I would like to bring to the \nattention of my Senate colleagues a piece that appeared in the November \n27 edition of the Wall Street Journal entitled ``Immigration: Where to \nGo From Here?'' In this piece, the Journal asked a panel of opinion-\nmakers--ranging from Jack Kemp to former New York Mayor Edward Koch to \nour colleague Ben Nighthorse Campbell--about the impact of legal \nimmigration on America's society and economy. I think that the views \nexpressed in this article will be helpful to my colleagues as we debate \nimmigration reform in the coming months. I ask that the article be \nprinted in the Record.\n  The article follows:\n\n             [From the Wall Street Journal, Nov. 27, 1995]\n\n                   Immigration: Where to Go From Here\n\n       Jack Kemp is a co-director of Empower America, a \n     conservative advocacy organization.\n       Some immigration policies badly need reform, especially \n     those having to do with illegal immigration. Under the 1986 \n     immigration reform act, for example, it's illegal to hire an \n     undocumented alien, and hard and costly even to hire a legal \n     one. By contrast, the law allows, and in many cases legally \n     mandates, payment of welfare, medical, education and other \n     benefits.\n       A better, more American, policy would be to make it easy \n     for immigrants to work--for example, with a generous guest \n     worker program and low-cost i.d. for participants. We can \n     design a policy that would be just and would create better \n     incentives, but would make it harder to get welfare payments. \n     For instance, the U.S. could more readily accept immigrants \n     who take a pledge not to go on welfare (a pledge many have \n     already taken).\n       With such policies, we not only can ``afford'' to keep the \n     golden door open; we will attract the same type of dynamic \n     men and women who historically helped build this immigrant \n     nation. Let's agree to reform the welfare state and not allow \n     America to be turned into a police state.\n                                                                    ____\n\n       Edward I. Koch is a former mayor of New York City.\n       The U.S. continues to benefit from the influx of legal \n     immigrants. Just to take a few examples: In Silicon Valley, \n     one out of every three engineers and microchip designers is \n     foreign born; in Miami, Cuban immigrants have revitalized a \n     once decaying city; and in New York, foreign nationals serve \n     as CEOs of banking institutions, as senior managers of \n     international companies, and as investors and entrepreneurs.\n       What the restrictionist legislative proposals seem to \n     ignore is the critical distinction between legal and illegal \n     immigration. The number of legal immigrants we admit each \n     year is limited and manageable. Fewer than 25,000 immigrants \n     received labor certifications (the prerequisite for obtaining \n     permanent resident status based on job skills) last year.\n       Under existing law, legal immigrants must establish when \n     coming here that they have sufficient assets to sustain \n     themselves or that they have a job with a salary that will \n     ensure their not becoming dependent on welfare. Lacking these \n     two, they are required to provide an affidavit from a \n     sponsor, usually a family member, who will be legally \n     responsible to make sure the immigrant and his family will \n     never become public charges. These commitments should be made \n     enforceable.\n       I do not believe that the U.S. would be the world's only \n     superpower if not for the super energy provided by the annual \n     influx of legal immigrants. I don't want to change that.\n                                                                    ____\n\n       Stephen H. Legomsky is a professor of international and \n     comparative law at Washington University School of Law, St. \n     Louis.\n       The U.S. has two venerable traditions. One is to admit \n     immigrants; the other is to complain that today's immigrants \n     are not of the same caliber as yesterday's. In actuality, \n     today's immigrants are just as resourceful as their \n     predecessors, and they are more vital to American industry \n     and to the American consumer than ever before. Imported \n     laborers used to be valued mainly for their muscle. In \n     today's high-tech global economy, brainpower has become the \n     more valuable resource. American companies and universities \n     compete with their foreign counterparts for the world's \n     greatest minds. Why donate this talent to our global \n     competitors when we can use it ourselves?\n       Yes, immigrants take jobs. But they also create jobs by \n     consuming goods and services, lending their expertise to \n     newly vibrant American export companies, starting businesses \n     and revitalizing cities.\n       Yes, some immigrants receive welfare. But immigrants also \n     pay taxes--income, sales, property, gasoline and Social \n     Security. For federal, state and local governments combined, \n     immigrants actually generate a net fiscal surplus.\n       Of course, immigration does far more than this. It reunites \n     husbands with wives and parents with children. It enriches us \n     culturally. It is, ultimately, the quintessential American \n     value.\n                                                                    ____\n\n       Peter Brimelow is the author of ``Alien Nation: Common \n     Sense About America's Immigration Disaster'' (Random House).\n       Immigration policy is broke and needs fixing. The perverse \n     selectivity of the 1965 Immigration Act has resulted in an \n     inflow vastly larger and more unskilled than promised. \n     Moreover, in the lull since the 1890-1920 immigration wave, \n     the American welfare state was invented. Its interaction with \n     mass immigration is paradoxical. At the turn of the century, \n     40% of all immigrants went home, basically because they \n     failed in the work force. Now immigrants are significantly \n     into welfare (9.1% vs. 7.4% for native-born Americans, maybe \n     5% for native-born whites). And net immigration is some 90%.\n\n[[Page S 17791]]\n\n       The real economic question about immigration, however, is: \n     Is it necessary? Does it do anything for the native-born that \n     they could not do for themselves? Here there is a consensus: \n     no. Indeed, the best estimate of the post-1965 influx's \n     benefit to the native-born, by University of California, San \n     Diego economist George J. Borjas, is that it is nugatory: \n     perhaps one-tenth of 1% of gross domestic product in total. \n     America is being transformed for--nothing.\n       Current legislation usefully reduces numbers. But \n     irresponsible politicians and pundits will prevent a full \n     Canadian-style reorientation to favoring immigrants with \n     skills and cultural compatibility such as English \n     proficiency, or giving consideration to guest workers, before \n     the inevitable backlash compels a total cut-off.\n                                                                    ____\n\n       Gregory Fossedal is founder and CEO of the Alexis de \n     Tocqueville Institution, Arlington, VA.\n       Immigrants pay $25 billion more in federal taxes than they \n     use in services, according to an Urban Institute estimate. \n     Preliminary data on patents, small business startups, and \n     city and state unemployment all indicate immigrants generate \n     net output and jobs. For a smaller budget deficit we should \n     run a people surplus.\n       Some want to ``skim the cream''--letting in lots of \n     engineers and millionaires, but fewer family members, \n     refugees and ``low-skilled'' immigrants. Tempting, but the \n     brilliant Indian and Chinese programmers working for \n     Microsoft often have wives or husbands or parents. Many \n     American executives need an affordable au pair: And the \n     George Soroses or Any Groves of tomorrow often have \n     nothing when they come. They bus tables or clean hotel \n     rooms before they build Fortune 500 companies. It's a \n     mistake for Vice President Al Gore to try to out-think \n     capital markets. Why should Sen. Alan Simpson be smarter \n     than the labor market?\n       We should sharpen the programmatic distinction between \n     being in the U.S. and being a U.S. citizen. Make it easy to \n     work or travel--but confer government benefits on citizens, \n     not on people who merely happen to be here (a change included \n     in the House welfare reform). This would end the shibboleth \n     that immigrants are costly, and ease legitimate concern that \n     America is losing its English-speaking core. Then there would \n     be support for the reform we really need--to let in more \n     immigrants.\n                                                                    ____\n\n       Barbara Jordan chairs the U.S. Commission on Immigration \n     Reform.\n       It is because we benefit from lawful immigration that \n     reform is necessary. The bipartisan USCIR recommends a \n     comprehensive strategy to deter illegal immigration: better \n     border management; more effective enforcement of labor and \n     immigration laws; benefits policies consistent with \n     immigration goals: prompt removal of criminal aliens. Most \n     illegal aliens come for jobs, so reducing that magnet is key. \n     Employers need tools to verify work authorization that fight \n     fraud and discrimination, reduce paperwork and protect \n     privacy. The most promising option: electronic validation of \n     the Social Security number all workers already provide after \n     they are hired.\n       A well-regulated legal immigration system sets priorities. \n     Current policy does not. More than one million nuclear \n     families are separated, awaiting visas that will not be \n     available for years. We recommend using extended family visas \n     to clear this backlog. Unskilled foreign workers are admitted \n     while many of our own unskilled can't find jobs. We recommend \n     eliminating this category. A failed regulatory system \n     prevents timely hiring of skilled foreign professionals even \n     when employers demonstrate an immediate need. We recommend a \n     simpler, less costly system based on market forces. We still \n     have a Cold War refugee policy. To maintain our commitment to \n     refugees, we should rethink our admissions criteria.\n       These reforms will further the national interest.\n                                                                    ____\n\n       Scott McNealy is chairman and CEO, Sun Microsystems Inc., \n     Palo Alto, Calif.\n       Sun Microsystems is an American success story, a company \n     that has benefited profoundly from the employment of highly \n     skilled legal immigrants. Founded in 1982 by individuals from \n     three countries--Vinod Khosla (India), Any Bechtolsheim \n     (Germany), and Bill Joy and myself (U.S.)--today Sun has more \n     than $6 billion in annual revenues and more than 15,500 \n     employees world-wide. Our latest technology effort was headed \n     by an Indian national and worked on by about 2,000 employees \n     from around the world.\n       While illegal immigration is a problem that needs to be \n     addressed, there are very real benefits to the U.S. economy \n     from the employment of highly skilled legal immigrants.\n       The legislation that is moving through Congress today, if \n     approved, will hurt Sun, and the industry. With at least half \n     of our revenue earned outside the U.S., and the bulk of \n     our R conducted inside the U.S., we need to hire the \n     best and brightest engineers and scientists, regardless of \n     their place of birth, to stay globally competitive. And \n     even though Sun is devoting considerable resources both to \n     training our employees and to educating students from \n     kindergarten through university, we are still confronted \n     with a shortage of U.S. workers with state-of-art, \n     leading-edge engineering knowledge. We must be able to \n     hire highly skilled legal immigrants now or we may miss a \n     product cycle in this fast-paced industry. Miss one \n     product cycle, you're seriously hurt; miss two, you're \n     history.\n       If Sun loses its ability to compete and recruit globally, \n     our employees and shareholders lose and ultimately the U.S. \n     loses.\n                                                                    ____\n\n       George E. Pataki is the governor of New York.\n       In my hometown of Peekskill, N.Y., where my immigrant \n     grandparents lived, the homes and flats that were rented by \n     immigrants from Hungary, Italy and Ireland in the early 20th \n     century are now rented by new immigrants from Peru, Mexico \n     and East Asia. In the early morning you can see many of these \n     new immigrants waiting for rides and for work as they begin \n     their long days as gardeners and laborers. Their work ethic \n     and their dreams for a better future parallel the work ethic \n     of America's earlier immigrants.\n       While the federal government must improve the policing of \n     our borders and assure that immigration is in fact legal, \n     Congress must avoid the temptation to pass restrictive \n     measures like California's Proposition 187. This is America, \n     not Fortress America.\n       Let those who share our values as Americans--hard work, \n     individual responsibility and a love for this country--\n     continue to strengthen our unique nation.\n                                                                    ____\n\n       Ben Nighthorse Campbell is a Republican senator from \n     Colorado.\n       One weakness of our immigration policy is that we \n     continually give amnesty to the illegal immigrants, \n     undermining the legal process and the intent of the law. But, \n     generally, immigrants still contribute more than they take \n     out. Many of them do jobs no American will do for any wage. \n     Immigrants from Southeast Asia go into inner cities and help \n     rejuvenate them by operating small restaurants and motels. \n     And most of them, to my knowledge, have no problems with the \n     law. The first thing they do when they get here is to find a \n     job and get to work.\n       If my ancestors on the Indian side had the same anti-\n     immigrant attitude that many Americans do now, those very \n     same people who now criticize immigrants wouldn't be here \n     themselves.\n       But, having said all that, I recognize you must have \n     control of your borders. You cannot have an open-door policy \n     for anybody and everybody. It becomes a national security and \n     national health problem when we give up having some control.\n                                                                    ____\n\n       Dr. Ruth Westheimer is the author of, ``Sex for Dummies'' \n     (IDG Books, paperback).\n       When I was 10 years old, I was permitted to immigrate to \n     Switzerland while my parents and grandmother were not. The \n     net effect was that I survived the Holocaust and they didn't. \n     If we in the U.S. are going to call ourselves followers of \n     the Judeo-Christian ethic, then we have a moral obligation \n     not to shut the doors to those who are being persecuted.\n       Now while I am not an economist, I also think that we \n     benefit a lot more than we admit from a constant flow of new \n     laborers. When I first came here, I was able to find a job as \n     a housemaid for a dollar an hour, which saved my life. Now I \n     employ a housekeeper who comes from the Philippines, and to \n     me she is a lifesaver. We all benefit from the Mexican \n     workers who pick our fruits and vegetables, and from the \n     Korean grocers who stay open all night selling them. If we \n     try to keep new immigrants from joining us, we will only be \n     cutting off our collective nose to spite our selfish \n     face.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/11/29/senate-section/article/S17790-1", "month": "11", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "29", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S17791-S17792]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           PRESIDENTS OF ARMENIA AND TURKEY MEET IN NEW YORK\n\n Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, I receive the Armenian Mirror-\nSpectator regularly, a weekly publication circulated primarily in the \nUnited States.\n  There are two items of interest in the October 28 issue. And the \nheadings on the two items tell much of the story. One is ``Presidents \nof Armenia and Turkey Meet in New York,'' and the other is ``Armenia \nSuggests Normalization of Ties With Turkey.''\n  The animosities of decades and, sometimes, centuries have to be \ndiminished in our world. One of those that hurts both Armenia and \nTurkey is the historic difficulties between these two peoples.\n  I urge both countries to continue to move along this path toward \nreconciliation.\n  And I ask that the two articles be printed in the Record.\n  The articles follow:\n\n          [From the Armenian Mirror-Spectator, Oct. 28, 1995]\n\n           Presidents of Armenia and Turkey Meet in New York\n\n                         (By Florence Avakian)\n\n       United Nations, NY.--On Monday, October 23, a private \n     meeting took place between Turkish President Suleyman Demirel \n     and Armenian President Levon Der Petrossian and their aides \n     at the Turkish Mission to the United Nations in New York. The \n     meeting at the Turkish UN headquarters, which is across the \n     street from the United Nations, underscored the importance \n     that Armenia puts on improved relations with Turkey.\n       Just before the Demirel-Der Petrossian meeting, the Turkish \n     President had met privately with Azerbaijani President Geidar \n\n\n[[Page S 17792]]\n     Aliyev, also at the Turkish Mission to the United Nations. Following \n     the Demirel-Aliyev meeting, the two leaders came out for a \n     photo opportunity with the more than 60 Turkish and Azeri \n     media representatives. This correspondent, who was the only \n     Armenian journalist present, asked the Turkish President:\n       FA: Mr. Demirel, do you have plans to have a trilateral \n     meeting with Presidents Der Petrossian and Aliyev?\n       SD: No, that will not happen. We are having bilateral \n     meetings with each other. At this time, there is no need to \n     have a summit. Armenia and Azerbaijan don't have a common \n     ground or agreement in order to have a three-way summit.\n       When the President of Armenia arrived for his meeting with \n     the Turkish leader, the Demirel-Aliyev meeting was still in \n     progress. He waited on another floor of the Turkish Mission \n     until the Azeri President left. Following the more than half \n     hour meeting between the Armenian and Turkish heads of state, \n     the two also came out for a photo op with the press.\n       Speaking in Armenian with an English interpreter, President \n     Der Petrossian commented, ``We are using all the \n     opportunities to achieve peace. During our meeting today, the \n     issue of settlement of the Nagorno Karabagh conflict was \n     discussed as well as the issues connected with bilateral \n     relations between Armenia and Turkey. I think that the common \n     understanding is to allow the resumption of military \n     activities in Nagorno Karabagh.\n       ``At the same time it is necessary for all parties to \n     express good will and to find constructive compromise and \n     solutions to the conflict. There are details that are to be \n     settled and discussed during the negotiating process. And \n     it's not only Lachin, but there are tens of issues in which \n     the parties' opinions differ from each other. Tomorrow, the \n     same issues will be discussed with Mr. Aliyev.''\n       This last statement was in reference to a private meeting \n     between the Armenian and Azeri Presidents which was scheduled \n     to take place on Tuesday morning, October 24, at 9:30 am, at \n     the United Nations headquarters.\n       Following the two bilateral meetings, the Turkish President \n     held a press conference with only the Turkish press, intended \n     for public consumption in Turkey. The Turkish press \n     representative summarized the information for this \n     correspondent after the briefing.\n       Demirel had reportedly said, without elaborating, that \n     after the dismemberment of the Soviet Union, the importance \n     of Turkey had increased. Concerning the Caucasus, he said \n     that it was Turkey's second foreign policy priority, after \n     the war in the former Yugoslavia, and that the Karabagh \n     conflict hurts not only Armenia and Azerbaijan, but also \n     Turkey and Georgia. His statement reportedly was that when \n     one neighbor is hurt, all are hurt. The Caucasus conflict \n     cannot be resolved by force, he said, and that peace will \n     open new opportunities.\n       The Turkish press representative continued the Turkish \n     President's comments which included the statement that \n     Turkey does not have designs against its neighbors, and \n     that Armenia and Azerbaijan will reach peace through the \n     Minsk Group. Demirel reportedly stated that he wants ``1.4 \n     million Azeris to return to their homes.''\n       In answer to a question by this correspondent three weeks \n     ago, Former Turkish Foreign Minister, Erdal Inonu, at a press \n     conference at the United Nations, used the figure of one \n     million Azeri refugees. (It is interesting to note, as I \n     reported at that time, that the International Red Cross puts \n     the figure of refugees resulting from the Caucasus conflict \n     at 1.1 million, 350,000 of which are Armenian refugees from \n     Baku, Sumgait and Karabagh.)\n       The Turkish President also mentioned that he had cancelled \n     his meeting with President Clinton in Washington because of \n     the government crisis in Turkey. However, he said that \n     President Clinton, at the Presidents' dinner at the United \n     Nations, told him that he is supporting Turkey. To this, \n     Demirel thanked Clinton for his support on the oil and terror \n     issues. The United States has supported Turkey on the Kurdish \n     question. One of the most vocal protest groups outside the \n     United Nations were the Kurds asking for freedom and self-\n     determination.\n       The Turkish crisis which brought down the Ciller government \n     resulted in the Turkish President returning to Turkey on the \n     evening of Monday, October 23.

The permanent \nRecord will be corrected to reflect the following statement.\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the Dorgan \namendment. Let me make some general remarks on the issues surrounding \nantitrust and some of the standards that are used. \n\n[[Page S 17820]]\n\n  First, let me point out that this amendment is an attempt to change \nthe way the ICC looks at the competition among rail carriers.\n  Changing the standards by which rail mergers are judged is very \ncomplicated. The current public interest standard is well established \nand has been in place for 75 years. Changing them now, particularly \nwhile two class one railroads are in a merger proceeding, without fully \nunderstanding how these changes affect railroads, shippers, States and \neven the financial markets, is not the approach we should take without \nfully understanding what we are doing. Unintended consequences could \neasily result.\n  We have one of the most efficient, if not the most efficient, \ntransportation system in the world. A large part of the system is the \nlevel of competition that exists between the transportation modes and \nwithin the modes. Merely trying to guarantee competition in the rail \nindustry by changing how the ICC looks at competition could easily \nbackfire.\n  In the last 15 years, there have been roughly a dozen rail mergers, a \ntremendous increase in concentration when just measured by the number \nof railroads. However, at the same time, real rates have fallen up to \n50 percent with the decreases occurring every year across all major \ncommodity groups and in all major geographic areas.\n  This cannot just be attributed to deregulation, because without \nongoing effective competition, the productivity gains that deregulation \nmade possible for the railroads would not have been passed through to \nthe shippers.\n  Without fully understanding what we are doing in this area, we could \neasily turn back this trend, even though we have the best intentions. \nAs a result, I urge that this amendment be defeated. I urge my \ncolleagues to vote against it as well.\n  Now specifically, the ICC does not apply or follow antitrust law, \nthough it pays very close attention to competitive issues. The rail \nsystem is the underpinning of our entire economy, and many rail \nefficiencies can be achieved only through mergers. The ICC applies a \npublic interest standard, under which the public benefits, competitive \nor otherwise, of a merger, are balanced against any detriments, again \ncompetitive or otherwise, of a merger. This process allows the \nCommission to approve consolidations, even if they otherwise would \nviolate antitrust laws.\n  Rather than applying a narrow DOJ-type antitrust analysis, the \nCommission has consistently looked at all factors in deciding the \ncompetitive impact of rail mergers and has found pure concentration \nmeasures, such as the number of railroads serving a point, to be too \nsimplistic a standard.\n  The UP/MKT merger is a good example. In that case, a number of \nmarkets went from three railroads to two. Various parties, including \nthe Justice Department, argued that there would be a reduction in \ncompetition in those markets and that conditions should be imposed to \nintroduce additional rail competition in them. The Commission rejected \nthese arguments, finding that the continued competition from a strong \nsecond railroad, the increase in competition from the merged system's \nintroductions of new single-line routes and other service improvements \nand other competitive constraints, such as modal and source \ncompetition, would keep competition vigorous.\n  In fact, the Commission was right. Union Pacific, at the request of \nan agency in California, had studied the rates in these 3-to-2 markets \nbefore and after the UP/MKT merger which was consummated in 1988.\n  What they found was that in all cases, rates had decreased \nsignificantly, confirming the Commission's conclusion that competition \nwould be intensified by moving from three railroads, one of which, MKT, \nwas a weak third, to two strong rail competitors.\n  The evidence is overwhelming that a mere reduction in the number of \nrailroads does not stifle competition and, in fact, can enhance it \nwhere the effect is to add to the efficiency of the merged carriers and \nto their ability to offer new services.\n  Furthermore, there is ample proof all across the country that where \nmarkets are served by two railroads with broad, equivalent networks, \nrail competition is intense. Perhaps the best example is a precipitous \ndrop in Powder River Basin, WY, coal rates following the entry of CNW \ninto the basin as a competitor, in partnership with UP against \nBurlington Northern.\n  This experience of huge declines in the rates for the transportation \nof Powder River Basin coal is flatly incompatible with any theory that \ntwo railroads in a market will collude to keep prices at or near the \nlevel where other constraints, such as truck or product competition \nwould cause a loss of traffic. Other examples are the intense two-\nrailroad competition throughout the Southeast, between Norfolk Southern \nand CSX, and for Seattle/Tacoma and other Washington and Idaho traffic \nbetween BN and UP.\n  The number of railroads alone is not what matters, it is the effect \nof the merger on competition. Absent some compelling reason for change, \nwhich has yet to appear, the current process should stand.\n  Mr. President, let me make a few more remarks, and if other Senators \ncome to the floor, I will certainly yield to them, but I want to \ncontinue to state my opposition to the Dorgan amendment.\n  Since 1920, due to the unique place railroads hold in our economy, \nCongress has consistently found that applying a pure antitrust standard \nto rail mergers is inappropriate.\n  Railroads carry roughly 40 percent of the freight in this country. \nThese include 67 percent of new autos, 60 percent of coal, 68 percent \nof pulp and paper, 55 percent of household appliances, 53 percent of \nlumber, and 45 percent of all food products. Much of this material is \ndelivered on a just-in-time basis.\n  What is impressive about these numbers is that, unlike the trucking, \nship, barge, and aviation industries, which operate over national \nsystems and which are built and/or maintained by Government and open to \nall operators, the goods that move by rail are transported over fixed, \nregional systems. Due to the regional nature of railroads, much more \ninterchange occurs than in other modes of transportation. That is, \nrailroads hand off cargo to one another while other modes of \ntransportation have very little of this type of interchange--truck to \ntruck, barge to barge.\n  As a consequence, there are natural efficiencies in these other modes \nthat do not readily occur in the rail industry. To achieve these types \nof efficiencies in the rail industry, there must be consolidations. \nMergers and consolidations allow the rail industry to maximize the use \nof its tracks, cut down on interchange points, get the most out of \nswitching yards, consolidate terminals and, in short, provide better \nservice to its customers at the lower cost.\n  In the past, Congress has recognized that rail consolidations cannot \noccur if rails are subject to the normal antitrust tests imposed on \nother businesses. What makes the ICC test different? There are three \nmajor components.\n  The first is the use of the public interest standard. When looking at \na merger, the Department of Justice focuses almost exclusively on \npossible reductions in competition. Under a pure antitrust review, the \nJustice Department could deny all rail mergers, which is what happened \nbefore the public interest standard was adopted. The ICC, on the other \nhand, takes into account both the public benefits of a merger, in terms \nof increased efficiencies, better service and enhanced competition, and \nany harms, in terms of reduced competition and loss of service.\n  The ICC also has the power to condition mergers to take care of \nanticompetitive concerns. While the Department of Justice could try to \nnegotiate conditions, it does not have the same power and discretion as \nthe ICC. As a result, the ICC can condition and approve mergers that \nare in the public interest but might normally fail a review by the \nDepartment of Justice.\n  The second is the open and well-developed process the ICC has for \nreviewing rail mergers. The process includes discovery, the development \nof a detailed record and a full and fair opportunity for all affected \nparties, including Federal agencies, States, localities, shippers, and \nlabor to be heard.\n  The DOJ process, on the other hand, is a closed informal ex parte \nprocess in which DOJ speaks with only those persons it chooses to and \nhears only the \n\n[[Page S 17821]]\nevidence it chooses to. There is no opportunity for discovery and no \nopportunity to learn and to respond to what others are saying.\n  Taken together, these first two points are extremely important. \nRailroads cannot be duplicated. The lines that exist today are \nessentially it. While spur lines and short lines may be built, there \nwill be no more railroads built from Chicago to LA or New York to St. \nLouis, not in the near future at least.\n  A fair, impartial system bound by rules and precedent where all \nparties can be heard is important in deciding how these systems are \nrationalized. A DOJ review is far more subjective. All parties may not \nbe heard and DOJ can decide which types of traffic patterns to look at, \nthereby making the process unpredictable from one case to another, from \none administration to another.\n  So I think, in looking at this, we have to look at what we are \ndealing with in the uniqueness of railroads. We will not have more \nrailroad lines built in this country in terms of major routes from \nChicago to LA or New York to St. Louis. We will have those remaining. \nBut the question as a public interest standard allows some flexibility \non the part of the rulemaking body which will now be in the Department \nof Transportation.\n  The third component is the actual approval. The Department of Justice \ndoes not approve mergers, it merely indicates whether or not the \nGovernment will bring suit to stop it. I think now under the Hart-\nScott-Rodino standard, companies can get an opinion before they \nactually go to the expense of getting together.\n  The ICC process brings with it a formal approval and preemption of \nother laws. This is important for a number of reasons. Without formal \napproval, abandonments or line sales contemplated by a merger will have \nto be approved by another agency. State laws designed to prevent or \nhinder mergers will not be preempted. This is particularly important to \nthe free flow of interstate commerce. Further, private parties would \nnot be prohibited from bringing suit to seek conditions or block the \ntransaction.\n  Finally, the Rail Labor Act would not be preempted. This is critical. \nMost railroads have 13 different unions with hundreds of different \ncontracts. Absent the preemption of the Rail Labor Act and the \nimposition of labor protection conditions, the merging carriers would \nbe forced to negotiate implementation agreements with each union under \nthe Rail Labor Act. Because rail transportation is so vital to the \neconomy, this act was created ``to avoid any interruption to \ncommerce.'' The act achieves this goal by obligating management and \nlabor to negotiate using a long, drawn-out process. Using this act to \nnegotiate the implementation of a merger would take years. As a result, \nwithout a formal approval, even if a merger were approved by the \nDepartment of Justice it would more than likely be years, if ever, \nbefore it could be implemented.\n  At the heart of this debate is, What is best for transportation \npolicy? The more than 500 railroads that are in existence today are an \nintegral part of our country's transportation system and are a linchpin \nin our economy. We have the best rail system in the world. The long-\nestablished national railroad merger policy has served our country \nwell. Absent some compelling reason, there is no basis for gambling \nwith the future of an industry that is so important to our Nation.\n  Finally, the private parties would not be prohibited from bringing \nsuit to seek conditions or block the transaction.\n  Finally, the Rail Labor Act would not be preempted. This is critical. \nMost railroads have 13 different unions with hundreds of different \ncontracts. Absent the preemption of the Rail Labor Act and the \nimposition of labor protection conditions, the merging carriers would \nbe forced to negotiate implementation agreements with each union under \nthe Rail Labor Act.\n  Because rail transportation is so vital to the economy, this act is \ncreated to avoid any interruption to commerce. This act achieves the \ngoal by obligating management and labor to negotiate using a long, \ndrawn-out process. Using this act to negotiate the implementation of a \nmerger would take years. As a result, without a formal approval, even \nif a merger were approved by the Department of Justice, it would more \nthan likely be years, if ever, before it would be implemented.\n  So, Mr. President, at the heart of our debate is, what is best for \ntransportation policy? The more than 500 railroads that are in \nexistence today are an integral part of our country's transportation \nsystem and are a linchpin in our economy.\n  We have the best rail system in the world, although it certainly \nneeds improvements, and the real rail rates are 50 percent lower than \nwhen the Staggers Rail Act was passed in 1980, despite a reduction of \nabout two-thirds in the number of major railroads. The long-established \nnational railroad merger policy has served our country well.\n  Absent some compelling reason, there is no basis for gambling with \nthe future of an industry that is so important to our Nation.\n  So let me say that I very much admire the intentions of my friend \nfrom North Dakota with this amendment. This piece of legislation has \nbeen many months in the negotiating stages. My friend from Nebraska \nfirst introduced the piece of legislation, and we decided to work as a \nteam. We had in various shippers, railroads, the public, and consulted \nwith State public commissions. We consulted with Governors. We \nconsulted with experts. We developed this piece of legislation that is \nhere on the floor. It is not perfect, but it has been crafted on a \nbipartisan basis. We also have the support of Senator Hollings, the \nranking member, and several of the Republican Senators.\n  We feel strongly that the public interest test that the ICC has said \nwill go with it to the Department of Transportation, we feel it would \nbe an additional layer of regulation to add to the Department of \nJustice and to add the antitrust standards which we feel exists anyway, \nbut it would be an unnecessary additional regulatory burden. We are \ntrying to deregulate as much as possible. This amendment would put us \nnot only into a pre-Staggers position, but we never had this much \nregulation.\n  Mr. President, we had a similar debate here. I stood in this very \nplace during the consideration of the telecommunications bill, which is \nnow in conference. We debated between the public interest, convenience \nand necessity standard used by the Federal Communications Commission \nregarding administrative law cases as opposed to adding an additional \nDepartment of Justice review of certain telecommunications, and it was \nthe decision of this body on a rollcall vote not to have the Department \nof Justice review because it is another layer of regulation.\n  We are trying to deregulate wherever possible. We are trying in this \nbill to have a review but not a lot of bureaucracy.\n  With all due respect, I must strongly oppose the Dorgan amendment. I \nurge my colleagues to defeat it.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I greatly respect the opinions of the \nSenator from South Dakota. I said before, and let me say it again, I \nthink he and Senator Exon and Senator Hollings have done a great job of \nputting together a bill, and with the exception of my interest in \nimproving it with this amendment, I think that the legislation that \nthey have crafted has great merit.\n  I want to just respond to two points the Senator from South Dakota \nmade. First of all, my amendment does not actually take the authority \nfor approval and move it from the board and DOT over to the Justice \nDepartment. That is not what the amendment does.\n  The amendment, rather, gives the Justice Department the opportunity \nto apply the Clayton standard and then advise the Board at DOT of its \nconclusion with respect to whether this meets the Clayton standard, and \nrequires the Board to give substantial deference to it. The decision \nwill still be made by the Board. That is an important point.\n\n  The second point is, the Senator from South Dakota spoke of \nderegulation. I am probably much less a fan of deregulation than he or \nsome others in this Chamber. There are certain areas in our country \nwhere regulation, I think, is critical, where, without regulation, you \nget price gouging, you get pricing outside of a free market that \ndisadvantages consumers. I will give some examples of that.\n  While I say this, I am not opposed to all deregulation. Some of it \nhas been \n\n[[Page S 17822]]\njust fine. But the Senator from South Dakota and I come from States \nthat are sparsely populated, and we often, especially in the area of \ntransportation, suffer the consequences of a deregulated environment in \nwhich, without competition, they extract prices that are unreasonable.\n  I used an example of the airline industry in the Commerce Committee \nthat the Senator from South Dakota will recall. I held up a picture of \na big Holstein milk cow, called Salem Sue. It is the world's largest \ncow. It happens to be metal, but it is the largest cow. It sits on a \nhill about 25 or 30 miles from the airport in Bismarck, ND, if you \ndrive down Interstate 94. I pointed out, if you get on a plane here in \nWashington, DC--and I admit, there are probably not a lot of folks who \nhave an urgent desire to go see the world's largest cow just for the \nsake of going to see the largest cow--but if your desire is to go from \nWashington, DC, to see the world's largest Holstein cow, 30 miles from \nthe Bismarck airport, you will pay more money for that trip than if you \nget on an airplane in Washington, DC, and fly to London to see Big Ben.\n  Or, let us decide you want to see Mickey Mouse and decide to fly to \nDisneyland in Los Angeles. You fly twice as far and pay half as much as \ngetting on an airplane here and flying to Bismarck. Question: Why would \nthat be? Answer: Because we do not have substantial competition. We do \nnot have the kind of competition in the airline industry that you have \nif you are in Chicago or Los Angeles. There, if you show up at the \nairport you have dozens of choices, all competing against each other, \nand the result is attractive choices at lower prices. But, with \nderegulation in the airline industry, we have fewer carriers, fewer \nchoices, and higher prices.\n  Now, deregulation is not always a boon to areas of the country that \nare sparsely populated. When you talk about deregulation with respect \nto railroad carriers, you must find a way, it seems to me, to provide \nprotections for consumers. My concern about all of this is that the \nconsumers be afforded an opportunity to have a price in the open market \nsystem or the free market system that is a fair price. We can foresee \ncircumstances, and we have already seen some in this country, where the \nprices charged in areas where there is not substantial competition are \nprices far above those that should be charged.\n  I mentioned earlier that my amendment is not directed at any carrier \nor any company or any merger. I mentioned I was interested in the \ntelecommunications legislation, and I rose to offer an amendment \nincluding the Department of Justice there. I also have been involved in \nsimilar issues.\n  About 3 weeks ago, I asked the Banking Committee in the Senate to \nhold hearings on bank mergers. This is not a newfound interest of mine. \nI was on a program awhile back and they asked me about my interests in \nhaving hearings on bank mergers. We were talking about a specific \nmerger where two very large banks were combining and merging to be a \nmuch, much larger bank. They said, ``Does that not make sense? Two \nbanks become one and you are able to get rid of a lot of overhead and \nlay off 6,000 or 8,000 people. Does it not make sense to be more \nefficient?\"\n  I said, ``Following that logic, it makes sense to have only one bank \nin America, just one. That way you do not have any duplication. Of \ncourse, you do not have any competition either.''\n  Following this to its extreme, this notion of efficiency without \ncaring much about what it does to the free marketplace and without \ncaring much about what violation occurs to the issue of competition, I \nsuppose you could make a case that in every industry the fewer \ncompanies the better, because the fewer companies the more efficient \nyou are going to become. You can lay off people. Of course, it would \nnot be very efficient for consumers, because you can then engage in \npredatory pricing and no one can do very much about it.\n  The point I am making is, I am not here because of a railroad or a \nmerger. I have been involved in the issue of bank mergers, calling for \nhearings at the Senate Banking Committee in recent weeks on that. I \nhave been on the floor on several other merger issues. I hope that the \nSenate will take a look at this and decide this makes sense. If it does \nnot, at the next opportunity I will again raise this issue.\n  Frankly, there are not many people in the Senate, or the House, for \nthat matter, who care to talk much about antitrust issues. First of \nall, it puts most people to sleep. You know, it is better than medicine \nto put people to sleep. Nobody cares much about it. Nobody understands \nit much. It is, to some people, just plain theory. But, if you are a \nshipper and you are somewhere along the line someplace and the company \nthat has captured the competition and is now the only opportunity for \nyou to ship says to you, ``By the way, here is my price; if you do not \nlike it, tough luck,'' all of a sudden, this has more meaning than \ntheory.\n  If you are a traveler on an airline and you have no competition when \nyou used to, but now the only remaining carrier that bought its \ncompetition and became one says to you, ``By the way, here is my price; \nif you do not like it, do not travel,'' then this is more than theory.\n  That is what persuades me to believe that in a free market system, if \nyou preach competition but do not care very much about whether \nmeaningful competition exists, or whether we have adequate enforcement \nof antitrust standards, then in my judgment you do no favor to the free \nmarket economy.\n  I hope people will consider this on its merits and consider that it \nwould be wise for our country and for public policy to ask that this \nlegislation be amended with the amendment I have offered, along with \nSenator Bond.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/11/29/senate-section/article/S17819-1", "month": "11", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "29", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S17822]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         THE BAD DEBT BOXSCORE\n\n  Mr. HELMS.

RAINES, JR.\n\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, William F. Raines, Jr., the administrative \nassistant to the Architect of the Capitol, is retiring on November 30, \n1995, after 43 years of Federal service. Bill began his career with the \nOffice of the Architect of the Capitol as a personnel clerk in February \n1956. He steadily advanced in various jobs and in October, 1973, was \nappointed to the position of administrative assistant to George M. \nWhite, the Architect of the Capitol.\n  As the Architect's administrative assistant, Bill was the management \nofficial responsible for that office's human resources, accounting, and \nprocurement divisions and the flag office, and for oversight of the \noperations of the Senate Restaurants. He also served as the coordinator \nof the superintendents and supervising engineers of the various \nbuildings under the Architect's jurisdiction, as well as the Capitol \ngrounds. In addition to these duties, Bill acted as adviser and \ncounselor to the Architect and, in effect, served as Mr. White's chief \nof staff.\n  Bill was born in Henderson, NC, and attended Henderson High School. \nHe completed his studies at Henderson Business College in July 1955. \nPrior to his employment with the Architect's Office, Bill worked for \nSoutheastern Construction Co. and Harriet Cotton Mills.

Mr. President, today marks the 20th anniversary of the \nEducation for All Handicapped Children Act, now known as the \nIndividuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA). I was proud to \nserve on the committee that approved IDEA in 1975, and I am proud of \nits successes in the past two decades.\n  For millions of children with disabilities, IDEA has meant the \ndifference between exclusion and participation, between dependence and \nindependence, between lost potential and learning.\n  Before IDEA was enacted in 1975, young people with disabilities were \noften shut away and condemned to life without hope. In 1975, 4 million \nhandicapped children did not receive the help they needed to succeed in \nschool--either because their disabilities were undetected or because \nschools did not offer the services they needed. Virtually no disabled \npreschoolers received services. A million school-aged children with \ndisabilities were excluded from public school.\n  Now, as a result of IDEA, every State in the Nation offers a free \nappropriate public education to the 5 million children with \ndisabilities, and provides early intervention services to infants and \ntoddlers with disabilities.\n  In the early 1970's, 95,000 children with disabilities lived in \ninstitutional settings. Today, fewer than 6,000 are institutionalized.\n  Only 33 percent of people with disabilities who grew up before IDEA \nwere competitively employed within 5 years after leaving school. Today, \nnearly 60 percent of young men and women with disabilities become \nproductive, taxpaying members of society.\n  In some respects, as we know, IDEA has fallen short. Too many \nstudents with disabilities drop out of school and have a high risk of \nunemployment. Some get in trouble with the law and spend a significant \namount of time in jail. Enrollment of students with disabilities in \ncollege is still too low.\n  We need to be more vigilant in our mission to make sure that all \nthese children grow up with the skills they need to get a job and live \nindependently.\n  Legislation to reauthorize IDEA will be considered by Congress in the \ncoming months, and I look forward to working closely with colleagues on \nboth sides of the aisle to achieve these important goals. The best way \nfor all of us to honor the law's success is to rededicate ourselves to \nmaking it even more effective in the future.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/11/29/senate-section/article/S17823-1", "month": "11", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "29", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S17823]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   YELLOWSTONE COUNTY DUI TASK FORCE\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS.

RICHARD C. HALVERSON\n\n  Mr. HEFLIN. Mr. President, our long-time Senate Chaplain and dear \nfriend, Dr. Richard C. Halverson, has passed away, just 8\\1/2\\ months \nafter his retirement. He retired in March, after more than 14 years of \ndistinguished service to this body. During his tenure as our Chaplain, \nDr. Halverson proved himself over and over again not only to be a \ncomforting spiritual guide, but an understanding, knowledgeable \ncounselor. His ministry and support helped us immeasurably as we \nwrestled with difficult personal, political and policy issues.\n  Dick Halverson was superb at arranging for guest Chaplains, thereby \ngiving wide representations to the many diverse religious faiths and \ndenominations in our Nation. As Chaplain, he provided pastoral services \nfor Members and our staffs--in particular to staffs, policemen. Every \nconceivable person that worked in the Senate felt his influence, knew \nhim as a friend. He was a tremendous help to them in their personal \nproblems. His soothing countenance and understanding manner made us \nfeel more at home here in Washington.\n  Sworn in on February 2, 1981, the Reverend Dr. Richard Halverson was \nthe 60th Senate Chaplain. A native of North Dakota, he was a graduate \nof Wheaton College and the Princeton Theological Seminary. He held \nhonorary doctoral degrees from Wheaton and Gordon Colleges, and served \nchurches in Kansas City, MO; Coalinga and Hollywood, CA; and for 23 \nyears at his last pastorate at the Fourth Presbyterian Church in \nBethesda, MD.\n  Dr. Halverson was deeply involved as an associate in the \ninternational prayer breakfast movement in Washington, and I had the \npersonal pleasure of working directly with him on this project during \nthe time he served here in the Senate. He was involved with the prayer \nbreakfast for almost 40 years. He also served as chairman of the board \nof World Vision and president of Concern Ministries, and authored \nseveral books, including ``A Day at a Time,'' ``Be Yourself . . . and \nGod's,'' ``Between Sundays,'' ``No Greater Power,'' and ``We the \nPeople.''\n  Richard Halverson was an outstanding example of why the Senate has \nalways had a chaplain. He was completely devoted to the Senate and we \nare grateful for his many years of service. We appreciate him, we will \nmiss him, and we extend our sincerest condolences to his wife Doris, \nhis son Chris, and all their family. Dr. Halverson left his mark on \nthis body, and it is not the same without him. The Senate is better for \nhaving had his guidance and wisdom for 14 years, and the Nation and \nworld are better for having had him for all the years of his life. He \nwas a true blessing.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/11/29/senate-section/article/S17823-3", "month": "11", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "29", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S17823-S17824]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     TRIBUTE TO CHAPLAIN HALVERSON\n\n  Mr. HATFIELD. Mr. President, last night the U.S. Senate lost one of \nits greatest servants. Dr. Halverson left us in bodily presence but his \nspiritual legacy will remain eternal. For 14 years, Dr. Halverson \nprovided guidance and counsel to the Senate as its Chaplain, \ncontinually reminding us of the true meaning of leadership. For Dr. \nHalverson a true leader was first a servant. He reminded us each and \nevery day, as he strolled these halls, of what it means to serve the \npeople around you.\n  I have said before that Dr. Halverson was one of the most Christlike \nmen I have ever known, and today that sentiment has not changed. Even \nin failing health, he continued his ministries right to the very end. \nThose of you who remember him, recall his humble spirit, his \ncompassionate heart, and his penetrating intellect. All of these \nqualities were supplemented with an uncanny ability to address complex \nissues with an insightful simplicity that cut to the core of an issue, \nilluminating the vital components so that even a child could \nunderstand.\n  Dr. Halverson will be profoundly missed. He will be missed by the \nSenators, but this mournful occasion will impact all who are involved \nin the business of Congress. Dr. Halverson was not just a pastor to the \nhundred men and women who serve in this body, but he was a pastor to \nthe police officers, to the custodians, to the food servce workers, to \neveryone who was fortunate to cross his path. He ministered to all he \nencountered, indiscriminate of position, background, and stature. He \ngenuinely loved everyone. I cannot recall him ever uttering an ill word \ntoward anyone.\n  I am deeply saddened by this great loss. Dr. Halverson was my close \nfriend \n\n[[Page S 17824]]\nand brother. Now, Dr. Halverson is experiencing joy and happiness \nincomprehensible to those of us here on Earth. But until I see him \nagain, I will miss this good and faithful servant. I will miss his warm \ngreetings. I will miss his thoughtful prayers. I will miss his example \nof humility. Most of all, I will miss being his friend.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/11/29/senate-section/article/S17823-4", "month": "11", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "29", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S17824]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           PAYING TRIBUTE TO THE LATE REV. RICHARD HALVERSON\n\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, our Senate family lost one of our finest \nand most respected members yesterday with the passing of the former \nSenate Chaplain, Reverend Richard Halverson.\n  As many in this body know, Reverend Halverson ministered to the \nspiritual needs of Senators, our families, and our staffs for many \nyears. A man who was deeply devoted to his duties as a servant of God, \nand to his congregation, Reverend Halverson selflessly served the \nSenate and the Lord almost literally to the end of his life. Despite a \nlingering illness in his later years, the Reverend was never too tired \nor sick to spend time with someone who required his guidance and \ncounsel. He was a man who always had a kind word and a positive thought \nto share with us. I remember, Reverend Halverson would often clip \nnewspaper and magazine articles that he felt were particularly relevant \nto the issues of religion and morality and send them to Members. Along \nwith these articles, he would include a thoughtful note offering his \nopinion on the author's thesis, a gesture that not only reminded us \nthat the Reverend was looking after our spiritual well being, but that \nthere are laws and directives as important as those found in the \nConstitution and code books that should dictate our behavior and \nconduct as leaders of the Nation. Reverend Halverson was so committed \nto the cause of restoring and maintaining righteousness in America, he \nwas the only natural choice to author the foreward to the book Right \nvs. Wrong, written by my good friend and former Chief of Staff, Harry \nDent.\n  I had the pleasure of knowing Reverend Halverson throughout his \nentire tenure in the Senate, and I can attest that he was one of the \nmost faithful, capable, and dedicated Chaplains to have served the \nUnited States Senate. Those of us who were here when Reverend Halverson \nretired last year felt this Chamber had lost a friend, those of us who \nare here today know the world has lost a kind and compassionate man.\n  Reverend Halverson is survived by his wife Doris, and I hope that she \nknows that each of us joins her in mourning the loss of her husband. \nWhile her husband and our friend is gone, he has left a little \nsomething of himself with those who knew him and we will never forget \nthe service he rendered, or the man he was.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/11/29/senate-section/article/S17824-1", "month": "11", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "29", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S17824]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    TRIBUTE TO DR. RICHARD HALVERSON\n\n  Mr. COATS. Madam President, 60 years ago, during the holiday season \nthat we are now celebrating, a young man by the name of Richard \nHalverson, fresh from the humble upbringing in North Dakota, found \nhimself discouraged and lonely in Hollywood, CA--discouraged by his \nstruggles to become an actor, and lonely as he was away from home \nduring Christmas for the first time in his 19 years of life. It was \nthen that Dick Halverson heard a call from the Lord--first, to believe \nand follow God, and then to preach the Lord's gospel and minister to \nall who had the great fortune of knowing him.\n  In 1988, I was privileged to be appointed to the U.S. Senate, filling \nthe vacancy created by the election of then Senator Dan Quayle to the \nVice Presidency. Several thoughts occurred to me and my family at that \nmoment, but one of the greatest was that I would have the privilege of \nserving in the same institution where Rev. Dick Halverson served as \nChaplain. My admiration for Dr. Halverson extended then and now beyond \nthe fact that we graduated from the same institution, Wheaton College. \nMy respect for Dick Halverson is based on the way he lived his life \nevery day in humble service to his God.\n  The American public primarily saw Chaplain Halverson in the role of \nopening each Senate session with prayer. As he prepared those \ninvocations each day, Pastor Halverson prayed that God would give him \nthe wisdom to speak the Lord's truth in what is known as the world's \ngreatest deliberative body. Without touching on specific bills or \nlegislation, Dr. Halverson prayed that God would lead Members of the \nSenate in reasoned, respectful debate.\n  For example, Chaplain Halverson prayed here on the Senate floor, \n``God of our fathers, if we separate morality from politics, we imperil \nour Nation and threaten self-destruction. Imperial Rome was not \ndefeated by an enemy from without; it was destroyed by moral decay from \nwithin. Mighty God, over and over again you warned your people, Israel, \nthat righteousness is essential to national health.'' Words of wisdom \nfrom a man of great wisdom.\n  Those of us privileged to know Dr. Halverson also experienced the \ndedicated and loving service he provided away from the lights of the \nSenate floor. Washington, DC, is one of the toughest, most intense \nplaces anybody can live, especially for those of us who work on Capitol \nHill. From overloaded Senate schedules to endless traffic jams, \nWashington can grind even the strongest individuals--which I think is \none of the reasons God gave us Dick Halverson.\n  Pastor Halverson used to say, ``I never try to be in a hurry.'' While \nall of us would scurry around from scheduled event to scheduled event, \nChaplain Halverson lived that phrase, ``I never try to be in a hurry.'' \nAnd he slowed us down. A smile, a hand on the arm, a twinkle in his \neye, and the words ``God bless you'' were delivered literally \nthousands, if not tens of thousands of times to Members of this body.\n  While our lives can be filled with stress and strife, it was Chaplain \nHalverson who always had the time to walk back with us to our office, \nchat with us on the telephone, and when necessary counsel us through \nour deepest struggles.\n  The real greatness of Dick Halverson, however, was exhibited in the \nways that he provided this selfless service, not just to those of us \nprivileged to serve as elected officials here in the U.S. Senate, but \nto all who crossed his doorstep or came upon his path. Just ask the \nSenate staffers, just ask the security guards, just ask the custodians, \njust ask the cooks in the kitchens, all of whom Dick Halverson knew on \na first-name basis.\n  For Pastor Halverson, we are created equal in the sight of God. Each \nperson is equally important and equally significant. Each personal need \nconveyed to him by others was serious and substantial regardless of who \nit was who conveyed that need. Our loss is great and our prayers are \nwith his surviving family.\n  But for Richard Halverson this is a new day. He has left his post in \nhis Nation's Government to sit in the throne room of the King. He has \nfought the good fight. He has finished the race and he kept the faith.\n  Chaplain Halverson once described himself as ``a servant to the \npublic servants.'' Because he served his role so well, we know today \nwith confidence that Dick Halverson is hearing those loving words from \nthe Lord Almighty, ``Well done, good and faithful servant.''\n  I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LOTT. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise in support of S. 1341, the \nSaddleback Mountain-Arizona Settlement Act of 1995.\n  I was very pleased to join with Senator Kyl in sponsoring this \nlegislation. Its purpose is to approve an agreement to settle a dispute \nbetween the Salt River Pima-Maricopa Indian community and the city of \nScottsdale, AZ, over 701 acres of land known as the Saddleback \nproperty. This property is currently held by the Resolution Trust \nCorporation.\n  The Saddleback property is located in the easternmost part of \nScottsdale, abuts 1.7 miles of the northern boundary of the Salt River \nIndian Reservation, and is undeveloped. Its most distinctive feature is \nSaddleback Mountain, a striking natural landmark that rises abruptly \nfrom the desert floor to a height of 900 feet. Due to its location, \nhigh conservation value and other special features, the property's use \nand disposition are of major importance both to the community and the \ncity.\n  A dispute arose after the Resolution Trust Corporation, in its \ncapacity as the receiver for the Sun State Savings & Loan Association, \nacquired the Saddleback property in 1989 and subsequently noticed it \nfor sale. The community submitted the highest cash bid for the \nproperty, $6,500,000, conditioned upon being able to develop the flat \nportion of the property. the city, concerned about the direction that \ndevelopment of the property by the community might follow, sued the \nResolution Trust Corporation to acquire the property by eminent domain. \nThe Resolution Trust Corporation then rejected all auction sale bids \nand determined to transfer the property to Scottsdale through the \neminent domain litigation. The community thereupon filed civil rights \nactions against the city and the Resolution Trust Corporation, seeking \ndamages.\n  Rather than pursue the litigation, the city, the community and the \nResolution Trust Corporation sought to resolve their dispute through \nnegotiation. The result of their efforts is a settlement agreement \nunder which the Resolution Trust Corporation will sell the property to \nScottsdale and the community for a total of $6,500,000. The city will \npay $636,000 to acquire approximately 98 acres for preservation and 27 \nacres for future expansion of an important traffic artery, Shea \nBoulevard. The community will pay $5,864,000 to acquire 576 acres \nadjoining its reservation, and this land will be added to its \nreservation. The two lawsuits, which are pending in the U.S. District \nCourt for the District of Arizona, will be dismissed.\n  Under the settlement agreement, 365 acres of the property to be \nacquired by the community, including Saddleback Mountain, will be \nforever preserved in its natural state for use only as a public park \nand recreation area. Except for a limited number of sites that are of \nparticular historical and cultural significance to the community, the \npublic will have free access to this area. Together with the \npreservation property to be acquired by the city, it will be jointly \nmanaged by the city and the community. The remaining 211 acres to be \nacquired by the community will be subject to a detailed development \nagreement with the city, as well as the limitations and restrictions of \ncurrent community zoning laws.\n  Enactment of S. 1341 will eliminate any ambiguity as to the \nenforceability of the settlement agreement, and will ensure that the \nlands purchased by the Salt River Indian Community will be held in \ntrust by the United States as part of the Salt River Reservation.\n  The sale of the Saddleback property to the Indian community and the \ncity will realize $6.5 million for the taxpayers, less any closing \ncosts incurred by the Resolution Trust Corporation. No new \nauthorization or expenditure of Federal funds is needed and none is \nprovided by S. 1341.\n  The Committee on Indian Affairs held a hearing on S. 1341 on October \n26, 1995, and on November 7, by voice vote, ordered the bill reported \nwith an amendment. As amended, the bill has the unqualified support of \nthe administration as well as the Salt River Pima-Maricopa Indian \ncommunity and the city of Scottsdale.\n  The Saddleback settlement reflects what President Lincoln referred to \nas the better angels of our nature. Rather than spend time and money on \nacrimonious litigation, the leaders of the tribal and city governments \nemphasized their common interests and negotiated their differences in \ngood faith as neighbors. The enhanced mutual respect resulting from \nthis cooperation is a significant byproduct of their efforts.\n\n[[Page S 17827]]\n\n  In particular, I congratulate Ivan Makil, the President of the Salt \nWater Pima-Maricopa Indian community, and Herb Drinkwater, the mayor of \nScottsdale, and their respective councils, for their enlightened \nleadership in resolving the questions and issues involving the \nSaddleback property.\n  As a result of their collective efforts, Saddleback Mountain will be \npreserved in its natural state in a park setting within what is a \nrapidly developing urban area. For generations to come, citizens of \nevery stripe will be able to appreciate and enjoy this unique natural \nmonument. Similarly, the Salt River Indian community is assured of \nalways being able to preserve and protect the historic and cultural \nareas of the mountain that are of great significance to its members.\n  The Saddleback settlement is a victory for common sense and civility. \nIt is irrefutable evidence that good will and mutual respect are key to \nfinding win-win solutions to complex problems. S. 1341 confirms this \nvictory and this evidence. I strongly urge the Senate to approve it.\n  Mr. LOTT. I ask unanimous consent the committee amendments be agreed \nto, the bill be deemed read a third time and passed as amended, the \nmotion to reconsider be laid upon the table, and any statements \nrelating to the bill be placed in the Record at the appropriate place.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The bill (S. 1341), as amended, was deemed read a third time and \npassed, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1341\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Madam President, I ask unanimous consent the Senate proceed \nto the immediate consideration of H.R. 2519, just received from the \nHouse.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (H.R. 2519) to facilitate contributions to \n     charitable organizations by codifying certain exemptions from \n     the Federal securities laws, and for other purposes.\n\n  The Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Madam President, I am pleased that the Senate today is \ntaking action on H.R. 2519, the Philanthropy Protection Act, and H.R. \n2525, the Charitable Gift Annuity Anti-trust Relief Act. Both bills are \nvery important to our Nation's charitable organizations. These bills \ndeserve our full support.\n  America's charities are America's inspiration. They serve those in \nphysical and spiritual distress. They educate our children and adults \nso that they can become self-sufficient. They enrich our lives through \nmusic and the arts. They seek cures for diseases that plague humanity. \nThey encourage the preservation of our environment. As our Government \nfinally begins to tighten its fiscal belt, America's charities will be \nexpected to assume an even greater responsibility. As they have done on \nso many occasions during war and peace, depression and prosperity, \nAmerica's charities are prepared to answer the call for assistance.\n  America's charities are a vital foundation of our Nation. However, \ntoday, they are under unwarranted and life-threatening assault. As many \nof my colleagues know, an ominous class action lawsuit in a Federal \ncourt in Texas has put American philanthropy in jeopardy. Specifically, \nthis lawsuit disingenuously attempts to apply securities and antitrust \nlaws meant to govern commercial enterprises to fundraising and money-\nmanagement techniques of charities. This is an application of Federal \nlaw never contemplated by Congress.\n  This lawsuit has been an issue of great concern to this Congress. To \ntheir credit, my friends and colleagues from Texas and Connecticut, \nSenators Hutchison and Dodd, identified this problem early on and \nintroduced S. 978 to address the issues raised in the lawsuit and \nclarify the role of the securities laws and the antitrust laws with \nrespect to charitable organizations. I am pleased to be one of a number \nof bipartisan cosponsors of this legislation. I am even more pleased \nthat the Senate is taking action to pass this legislation. Quick action \nto enact this legislation would free donors to make year-end gifts \nwithout fear of becoming entangled in a stressful, costly lawsuit. \nFurther, enactment of this bill would free charities to do what they do \nbest: serve the people of America. With the beginning of the holiday \nseason--the peak period of charitable giving--passage of this bill \ncould not have come at a better time.\n  I also would like to commend our colleagues in the House of \nRepresentatives. They took action last night and passed both H.R. 2519 \nand H.R. 2525 unanimously. I applaud the House leadership and the \nbipartisan sponsors of this bill, including Representatives Hyde, \nConyers, Bliley, Fields, Dingell and Markey, among others, for working \ntogether to pass the bill as part of the House's Correction Day \ncalendar.\n  Action is needed. Millions of dollars of donations that should be \ngoing to charitable programs are instead being wasted on attorneys' \nfees and needless litigation. We must not stand idly by while America's \ncharitable organizations are looted. Both bills make clear that \ncharities that go astray of both the law and the public trust will be \nheld accountable to the full extent of the law. Both bills would end \nunfair punishment of those charities that play by the rules and pursue \ntheir missions in good faith. Both bills restore fairness to the law \nand remove the cloud over charitable giving. Today, we can send an \nimportant signal to our citizens that in their time of need, America's \ncharities will still be there for them and future generations.\n  Again, I commend my colleagues from Texas and Connecticut, Senators \nHutchison and Dodd, and all the co-sponsors of S. 978, for coming \ntogether in a demonstration of bipartisan support for America's \ncharities.\n  I urge all my colleagues to support immediate passage of H.R. 2519 \nand H.R. 2525.\n  Mr. LOTT. I ask unanimous consent the bill be considered and deemed \nread a third time and passed, the motion to reconsider be laid upon the \ntable, and any statements relating to the bill appear at appropriate \nplace in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The bill (H.R. 2519) was deemed read three times and passed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/11/29/senate-section/article/S17828-1", "month": "11", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "29", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S17828]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              CHARITABLE GIFT ANNUITY ANTITRUST RELIEF ACT\n\n  Mr. LOTT.
