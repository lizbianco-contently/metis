There will be a period for morning business until 10:30 \na.m. with Senators permitted to speak for up to 5 minutes each. We are \ncontinuing budget negotiations today. As I said yesterday, I think we \nhave made some progress, and we will continue again, beginning at 11 \na.m. There is hope that the Senate can pass legislation today that \nwould deem all Government employees essential, thereby sending \neverybody back to work. If that legislation can be worked out, it would \nbe the intention of the leadership to pass that bill by \nunanimous consent.\n\n  I am also advised the House may take action on that bill today and \nsend it to the Senate, so that would require us to take some action. In \naddition to that, they may add to that the Middle East Peace \nFacilitation Act, plus the expedited procedure would also be in the \nHouse bill.\n  Also today, before we go over until tomorrow, we hope to pass the \nmilitary COLA increase contained in the DOD authorization bill and \nvetoed by the President. We may include in that other provisions that \nneed to be attended to in the next few days, so there will be a further \nannouncement on that. Again, I hope we can do that by unanimous \nconsent. I do not know of any objection to the military COLA increase \ncontained in the DOD authorization bill.\n  I will not make any unanimous-consent requests at this time, but I \nwill probably later in the day, and I will advise the distinguished \nDemocratic leader, Senator Daschle, so there will not be any surprises.\n  Again, let me indicate I hope we can work out some expedited \nprocedure. If we are going to get an agreement where all the party \nleaders are involved--Democrats, Republicans, and the President--it \nseems to me that we ought to be able to agree on some procedure in the \nSenate so we can pass the 7-year balanced budget once we agree to it. \nOtherwise, we could be in debate here for weeks and weeks and weeks \nbecause of Senate rules. That is all that is holding up all these \nFederal workers going back to work. We are prepared to pass that bill \nimmediately. Federal employees can go back to work and be guaranteed \ntheir pay. To me, that would be a big step in the right direction.\n  I hope we can resolve this before the day is finished. We will be \ndiscussing it, I am certain, with Senator Daschle and others throughout \nthe day.\n  I understand that the Senator from North Dakota, Senator Dorgan, \nwishes to speak, and following his remarks, unless there are any other \nrequests, I move we stand in recess subject to call of the Chair.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/12/30/senate-section/article/S19317-5", "month": "12", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "30", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S19317-S19318]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                RECESS SUBJECT TO THE CALL OF THE CHAIR\n\n  Mr. DOLE.

Mr. President, we have been in recess subject to the call \nof the Chair, and we will recess again in a moment, but I wanted to \nannounce that the House did pass the bill that we tried to pass last \nnight in the Senate. It extends the Mideast Peace Facilitation Act for \nI think 90 days. It deems all Federal employees essential. In other \nwords, they can all go back to work. It guarantees they are going to be \npaid. And it also has attached to it expedited procedure so when we get \na balanced budget, we will not be engaged in weeks and weeks and months \nand months of debate in the Senate.\n  Now, some of my Senate colleagues may wonder why that is in the House \nbill. It is in the House bill because we could not pass it on the \nSenate side. So they agreed to put it in their bill. And we have been \nworking together on the theory that if we get a balanced budget \nagreement with the President of the United States and with the \nDemocratic leaders and the Republican leaders, we ought to pass it. The \nAmerican people want us to pass it.\n  So I would only say that later this afternoon, after having an \nopportunity to visit with the Democratic leader, I will make a \nunanimous-consent request that we turn to the message from the House on \nS. 1508, the so-called back-to-work bill, which also provided for \nexpedited procedure and extension of the Middle East Peace Facilitation \nAct. That is what we will try to clear later today. If we cannot do it, \nwe cannot do it. It just takes one objection.\n  I wish to commend the House for their leadership, Congressman Wolf \nand Congresswoman Morella and Congressman Davis, for their initiative \nthis morning in getting this done and also the majority leader, \nCongressman Armey, and the Speaker, Congressman Gingrich.\n  So hopefully we will get this done. If this happens, people can start \nmaking plans to go back to work after the New Year's holiday.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/12/30/senate-section/article/S19318-1", "month": "12", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "30", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S19318]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                RECESS SUBJECT TO THE CALL OF THE CHAIR\n\n  Mr. DOLE.

I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to the \nimmediate consideration of S. 1514, introduced today by myself for \nSenators Stevens, Thurmond, Coats, and others which would authorize a \n2.4-percent increase in pay and allowances and a 5.2-percent increase \nfor basic allowance for quarters for the members of the uniformed \nservices.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the immediate \nconsideration of the bill.\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, the bill I have proposed will \nprovide the increases adopted by Congress for military pay and \nallowances. This action is necessary today for one reason--the \nPresident vetoed the Defense authorization bill.\n  H.R. 1530, the fiscal year 1996 National Defense Authorization Act, \npassed both Houses of Congress with bipartisan support. I regret the \nPresident chose to veto this legislation. Beyond addressing these vital \nrequirements to support the men and women who serve in the Armed \nForces, and their families, this bill authorized important initiatives \nto accelerate modernization of the Armed Forces, and enhance our \ndefenses against theater and intercontental ballistic missiles. These \npriorities are fully funded in the 1996 Defense Appropriations Act, \nwhich became law on December 1.\n  Mr. President, with 20,000 Americans on their way to Bosnia, and \n15,000 more deploying in support of the 1st Armored Division, this is \nnot the time for the President to play politics with the pay and \neconomic well-being of military families. With thousands more Americans \ndeployed to the Persian Gulf, standing watch in Korea, and keeping the \npeace in Haiti, they should not have to worry about whether we will do \nour part to make sure they receive the pay and benefits they have \nearned through their service.\n  Mr. President, this bill should not be controversial. The House and \nSenate each passed these pay and allowance increases in legislation \nearlier this year, and endorsed these funding levels in the \nappropriations bill. The pay raise for civilian Federal workers will \ntake effect on January 1--that does not require further legislation. \nThere is no rationale to deny this modest increase for the men and \nwomen of the Armed Forces, and I hope the Senate will pass this bill \nwithout objection.\n  It had been my intention to offer an amendment today which would have \nauthorized for all of 1996 the full military pay and allowance \nincrease. At this time it is not possible to get unanimous agreement \nfor this approach, therefore I reluctantly accept a time limitation as \nthe way to ensure that the men and women of our Armed Forces will \nreceive their pay and allowance increases in a timely manner.\n  Just 2 weeks ago, the Senate voted with a large bipartisan majority \nto express its support for the military personnel ordered to Bosnia. \nMany of us disagree with the process that sent them there, but I \nbelieve all Members of the Senate strongly support those soldiers, \nsailors, marines, and Air Force personnel who are doing their duty. \nEven more than our expression of support for their mission, this bill \ngives us a chance today to take action, to enhance their economic well-\nbeing and the welfare of their families.\n  We must act on their legislation today, to ensure that they will \nreceive the full increase in pay and allowances for the month of \nJanuary. I appreciate the efforts of the majority leader, Senator Dole, \nto move this legislation and protect the pay and benefits of all \nmilitary personnel. I hope that the President will join with the \nCongress and sign this bill, and permit the pay and benefits increase \nalready approved by Congress to become law.\n Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, this bill will correct a problem \ncreated when President Clinton vetoed the 1996 Defense authorization \nbill. By so doing, he denied the full pay raise and the increase in the \nbasic allowance for quarters provided in that bill. Military pay is \nagain slipping further behind comparable civilian pay. This is \nhappening at a time when our military personnel are increasingly being \ncalled upon to deploy in support of U.S. commitments around the world. \nOur troops deserve this raise and they should receive it without delay. \nAt this very moment, and throughout this holiday season, our troops \nhave been leaving their families in Germany and throughout the United \nStates to fulfill a commitment made by the President to try to bring \npeace to Bosnia and other parts of the former Yugoslavia. These young \nmen and women, and their families, deserve the best we can provide for \nthem in every way. They should have a standard of living at least as \nhigh as they could expect in the civilian sector and they should have \nthe very best in supplies and equipment. That is what our authorization \nbill was designed to provide for them. However, the President chose to \nveto that bill for reasons that are apparently more political than \nsubstantive. This was done as our soldiers were trying desperately to \nstem the flood of the Sava River just to get into Bosnia. A commander \nshould always have the welfare of the troops paramount in his mind. A \nCommander in Chief should act similarly. Although he did not, this bill \nwill help to restore some of what was lost in his veto.\n\n[[Page S19319]]\n\n  I appreciate the cooperation of Senators Dole and Stevens in the \nexpedious consideration of this bill.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the bill be \nconsidered read a third time, passed, and the motion to reconsider be \nlaid upon the table.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  So the bill (S. 1514) was considered to have been read the third time \nand passed, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1514\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled, \n       Sec.   .

The majority leader and I have been discussing the \neffort to bring people back to work. Unfortunately, we are not at a \npoint where a resolution will be offered this evening. I must say I am \nvery frustrated by the current set of circumstances. I know it is hard \nfor the American people to understand what is going on. Frankly, it is \nhard for me to understand. All rationality seems to have been lost in \nthis process, but let me try to explain the situation as I see it.\n  All year, the Speaker and his lieutenants have warned that they would \nshut the Government down as part of their revolution. They did not care \nwhat the price was; they wanted to force their radical agenda on the \nPresident and on the American people. And each day there has been a new \ndemand, each day a new hostage--Federal employees, people who depend on \nGovernment services, now even the Middle East peace process.\n  The majority leader has worked in good faith in an effort to try to \nresolve this matter. And he has said he does not believe in shutting \nthe Government down. I believe him, and I share that view very \nstrongly. The Government remains shut because some Members in the House \nwant it shut. It is government by gimmick, and it is wrong.\n  The majority leader offered a bill to declare all Federal employees \nessential, and that bill was pending in the House for a long period of \ntime. They could have passed it at any moment and sent it directly to \nthe President. It was pending for 8 days. Instead, the House has chosen \nto play political games with it.\n  Furthermore, while I support the Dole-Warner bill, I must say it \nfalls short of what I think we need to do, frankly. It is an important \nstep, but it is not a solution to the problems caused by the Republican \nGovernment shutdown.\n  Congress has to pass legislation to fund the Government. Not once, \nnot twice, but on nine separate occasions now we have offered a \ncontinuing resolution to do that, but each time it was met with \nRepublican objections. Under the measure that is now being \ncontemplated, a measure which would make all Federal employees \nessential, Government workers still could not obligate new funds, make \nnew purchases or do any traveling; they could not spend any money; they \ncould not pay contractors; they could not make grants; they could not \nbuy supplies; they could not be paid.\n  Let me emphasize, under the Dole-Warner legislation, Federal workers \nwould be at work but they would not be paid until some later date, and \nthen they would be paid retroactively. So we will be asking them to go \nto work, which is better than asking them to stay home, but we will be \nasking them to go to work and not be paid.\n  Mr. President, keeping the Government closed is an unacceptable \nsituation. We should not allow that to occur. Small businesses would \nnot be able to get SBA loans, and 2,500 FHA home mortgage closures \nwould be blocked; health researchers awarded NIH grants would still not \nbe funded. If a forest ranger's truck ran out of gas in a national \npark, there would be no money to fill it up. State and local entities \nwould not be funded for programs like Meals on Wheels; students would \nnot get their college loans.\n  I believe that the House wants confrontation, not solution. Time and \nagain we have offered solutions. Time and again, working with the \nmajority leader, who I believe wants solutions, we have not been able \nto get that job done.\n  So we will keep working toward a solution. And as I say, I commend \nthe majority leader for his efforts in trying to accomplish what we \nknow we must do. We are not there yet. I have very, very grave \nreservations about the fact that we still on this day have not been \nable to send a clear message to Federal employees or to the U.S. \ntaxpayers that this issue can be resolved. Let us hope that prior to \nTuesday it will be resolved.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/12/30/senate-section/article/S19319-3", "month": "12", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "30", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S19319-S19320]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 GETTING FEDERAL EMPLOYEES BACK TO WORK\n\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I will just take a minute or two. I do share \nthe view expressed by the Democratic leader that it is not fair to the \nFederal employees. And I must say that a lot of people call me and say \nit is not fair to the taxpayers; if you are paying people for not \nworking, that is not a very good idea either. I do not suggest the \nFederal employees want it that way, but that is precisely what has \nhappened.\n  It is my hope we can come to some resolution here very quickly. That \nis why we will come in again tomorrow at noon, in the hopes that \ntonight we can work out something so that people can go back to work on \nTuesday, and that if they cannot be, as the Democratic leader \nindicated, paid immediately, at least they can be assured they will be \npaid.\n  I think we have made progress in our budget negotiations with the \nPresident, with the Democratic leadership, Senator Daschle, Congressman \nGephardt, myself, Speaker Gingrich, and Majority Leader Armey on the \nHouse side. We will go back tonight, we are going to be there tomorrow \nmorning, and maybe even later tomorrow, but at least tomorrow morning. \nI hope during that time tonight and tomorrow morning the Democratic \nleader, Senator Daschle, and I can devise some way to come back up here \ntomorrow, pass a resolution, send it to the House, and that the House \nwill accept it.\n  It seems to me that on Tuesday Federal employees should be back to \nwork, parks should be open, and we ought to be about our business. I \nhope we can get that resolved.\n  I just say, so that the record is complete, a number of bills were \npassed that were vetoed by the President: VA-HUD, a lot of Federal \nemployees involved; State, Justice, Commerce, vetoed by the President, \na lot of Federal employees involved; the Interior bill, vetoed by the \nPresident, a lot of Federal employees involved; Labor-HHS, we cannot \nget it up because of a party \n\n[[Page S19320]]\nsplit on the Senate floor, a lot of Federal employees involved. We do \nhave a CR for the District of Columbia until the 3d of January. That \nleaves one bill that is still hung up because of one difference. We \nought to be able to resolve that one difference. The foreign operations \nappropriations bill is very important, and I hope we can resolve it \nperhaps as early as Wednesday or Thursday of this next week. We are \nprepared to proceed. We had hoped we might have passed the bill with \nthe Mideast Peace Facilitation Act, deeming all employees essential, \nand the expedited procedure. That is not going to happen. We need to \nfind another way to address the problem.\n  As the Democratic leader indicated, the primary aim is to get people \nback to work as quickly as possible, either with pay or certainly with \nthe assurance that they will be paid, so that they can make plans that \nare necessary. I know I speak for my colleague, Senator Warner of \nVirginia, who has been in contact with me daily, and I know other \nMembers of the House who were in contact with me today, Congresswoman \nMorella of Maryland, Congressman Wolf, and Congressman Davis of \nVirginia. We will be working with them and others who have an interest \nin this. I thank my colleague.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/12/30/senate-section/article/S19319-4", "month": "12", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "30", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S19320]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  ORDERS FOR SUNDAY, DECEMBER 31, 1995\n\n  Mr. DOLE.

May Your will be done in this place through the guidance \nof Your holy spirit.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that once the Senate \nreceives the document entitled ``A Bill to Provide for Deficit \nReduction and Achieve a Balanced Budget by the Fiscal Year 2002,'' that \nis agreed to by the President and the congressional leaders, that the \nbill be considered under the following restraints:\n  That there be 12 hours for debate on all amendments, motions, and \nappeals in connection therewith, and all other provisions in the \nCongressional Budget Act of 1974 be in effect as if it were a \nreconciliation bill.\n  I further ask that once the Senate receives from the House the bill \nentitled ``A Bill to Provide for Deficit Reduction and Achieve a \nBalanced Federal Budget by 2002,'' that it be in order for the majority \nleader to introduce and place directly on the Senate Calendar the \nconcurrent resolution revising the first concurrent budget resolution, \nas provided for under the Budget Act of 1974, and that the \nconsideration of that concurrent resolution be limited to 1 hour to be \nequally divided in the usual form, with all other provisions of the \nBudget Act in effect with respect to the consideration of that \nconcurrent resolution.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, our colleagues should know that the \neffect of this unanimous-consent agreement is to ask Federal workers to \nshow up in their offices without being given authority to do virtually \nanything. Anything that would cost money would be prohibited. They \nwould be required to sit on their hands and stare at each other day \nafter day after day, until we pass something that gives them the right \nto do something.\n  So what this would allow them to do is to go to their offices, sit on \ntheir hands, and do nothing. They could not get in their trucks because \nthey use gas. They could not make a long distance phone call because \nthat would incur an expense. Anything that any office would do that \nincurs an expense would still be prohibited.\n  So, Mr. President, this is a facade. This does not work. This is not \nwhat we should be doing. Federal employees ought to come back to work. \nThey ought to be paid. And the services they are paid to deliver ought \nto be funded. Federal employees ought to be allowed to come back to \nwork, not just go to their offices, but to actually work, and Federal \nemployees--who have been without pay since December 15--ought to be \npaid. This does not do it, and so I object.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Objection is heard.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/12/31/senate-section/article/S19322-2", "month": "12", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "31", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S19322]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          UNANIMOUS-CONSENT REQUEST--HOUSE MESSAGE ON S. 1508\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to the message from the House on S. 1508 and concur in the \nHouse amendment with a substitute continuing resolution, giving them \nfull authority to do all that they need to do once they go back to \nwork, which reopens the Government and provides for the payment of all \nFederal employees who have been without pay since December 15, that the \nmotion to concur be agreed to and the motion to reconsider be laid on \nthe table.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection?\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, reserving the right to object. Let me \nindicate, first of all, I regret we were unable to reach some agreement \ntoday. We have not given up. We are going to come back here again \nTuesday and, hopefully, by then we will have an agreement. I do not \nshare the view of some of my colleagues that we ought to have a partial \nshutdown of the Government, or that the people should not be paid. But \nI do believe that we need to find some agreement. If we can get this \ndone, we also would be willing to give some on what would happen if a \nbalanced budget amendment were agreed to by the President, the \nDemocratic leader, and the Republican leaders in the Senate and in the \nHouse, and we could move rather quickly if that were possible.\n  I am afraid that if this goes back to the House without some \nagreement even between me and my friend, Senator Daschle--we hoped to \nget a unanimous-consent agreement--not put it to legislation--and send \nback the deeming provision with a couple of provisions that the White \nHouse asked us to add today. One would permit Federal employees to \napply for and receive unemployment compensation, which would be \nreturned or refunded once they were paid. And the second thing, even \nthough they have been furloughed, it would not interrupt their normal \nleave policy. We were prepared to add those at the request of White \nHouse counsel. By Tuesday, hopefully, we can work that out. I regret we \nwere not able to do it now. Therefore, I object.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, let me emphasize that the resolution that \nI attempted to get unanimous consent for would have allowed Government \nto go back to work. We would not have had this sham proposal sent over \nto us by the House that does not allow people to go to work, does not \nallow people to get paid, does not allow people any opportunity to do \nanything once they are in their offices. So people ought to understand \nthis. I have seen in the media for the last couple of days that this \nresolution somehow would allow Federal employees to go back to work. \nThere is a distinction between going back to work and going to their \noffices. They will be able to go to their offices, but they will not be \nallowed to go back to work. Nor will they be paid.\n  So I would just emphasize that that is our first choice, to allow \nthem to go back to work and have a continuing resolution that allows \nall Federal agencies to operate as they should during this time. If \nthat cannot be done, I would pose the second unanimous-consent request, \nand that is the one that Senator Dole and I agreed to last Friday, the \n22d of December. On that occasion, with some reservation, I agreed to \nat least allow them to go to their offices to do whatever they could \nunder very significant constraints.\n  They are not going to get paid, but since we did go on record on \nDecember 22d, Friday, to at least do that, to allow them to go back to \ntheir offices, I now ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to \nthe message from the House on S. 1508, that the Senate concur in the \nHouse amendment with a substitute amendment, which includes the text of \nthe distinguished majority leader's back-to-work bill, that the motion \nto concur be agreed to, and the motion to reconsider be laid upon the \ntable.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection?\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, and I shall \nobject.\n  Again, repeating, it seems to me that there was a provision that we \nmight \n\n[[Page S19323]]\nhave added to the deeming provision which would have defined the scope \nof employment once back to work. We are told that the Justice \nDepartment, or whoever would make that determination, would probably \nconclude that they could go back into almost normal duties. We were \nprepared to at least look at that provision. In fact, I ask unanimous \nconsent that that provision be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the provision was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n     SEC.   . SCOPE OF EMPLOYMENT.\n\n       Employees excepted from furlough during any period in which \n     there is a lapse in appropriations for the activity in which \n     the employee is employed shall engage in the normal \n     activities of their position, including the obligation of \n     necessary operating expenses, but not including entering into \n     new program obligations such as grants or contracts.\n\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, it was not made part of the technical \nchanges. The White House had some concern with it, too. In any event, \nwe need to end the impasse. That is what I have been about and what the \nSenator from South Dakota has been about, and the Senator from North \nDakota, along with a number of my colleagues. I met this morning with \nCongresswoman Morella from Maryland and Congressman Davis from \nVirginia, and I have been in contact with Congressman Wolf from \nVirginia and Senator Warner from Virginia. They have a lot of Federal \nemployees in their States and districts. We believe they ought to be \npaid. They should not be hostages or pawns. We ought to end this. It \nhas gotten to the point where it is a little ridiculous, as far as this \nSenator is concerned.\n  We are going to keep trying. Hopefully, on Tuesday, if we cannot do \nanything else, we may pass whatever it takes on the Senate side, I say \nto my colleague from South Dakota.\n  In the meantime, I must object.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Objection is heard. The Democratic \nleader.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/12/31/senate-section/article/S19322-4", "month": "12", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "31", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S19323]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          UNANIMOUS-CONSENT REQUEST--HOUSE MESSAGE ON S. 1508\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I said this on the floor yesterday \nafternoon, and I will repeat it this afternoon. I know that the \ndistinguished majority leader wants an agreement as much as I do, and I \ndo not hold him personally responsible for the fact that we are not \nable to overcome this impasse. I commend him for his efforts at trying \nto do so again today.\n  Let me try one other option. We have already been unable to agree to \na continuing resolution that would have put all Federal employees back \nto work with pay. We have been unable to agree to something that we \nagreed to last Friday, the 22d of December, which would have at least \nsent them back to their offices without pay. Perhaps we can try this.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to the message from \nthe House on S. 1508, that the Senate concur in the House amendment \nwith a substitute amendment that includes the text of Senator Dole's \nback-to-work bill, and the House-passed expedited procedures shall take \neffect only if the budget agreement does not cut Medicare more than \nnecessary to ensure the solvency of the Medicare part A trust fund and, \nsecond, does not raise taxes on working Americans, does not cut funding \nfor education or environmental enforcement, and maintains the \nindividual health guarantee under Medicaid and, third, provides that \nany tax reductions in the budget agreement go only to Americans making \nunder $100,000; that the motion to concur be agreed to, and the motion \nto reconsider be laid upon the table.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection?\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I want to say a few words. But I will \nobject.\n  We are working on a lot of these things in our meetings at the White \nHouse, where we have both been for a number of hours. I think we have \nmade some progress. We are a long way from any solution yet.\n  I think all of the things listed by the Democratic leader are areas \nof concern in the meetings we have had. And the meetings will start \nagain on Tuesday. But it seems to me that it would not be appropriate \nto proceed under those terms, and therefore I object.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I know there is an effort here by both sides \nto make a record. Even though we both agree that something is going to \nbe done, I think we have Members on both sides of the aisle who may \nhave different views. I am not going to ask consent that we reconsider \nall the appropriations bills that the President has vetoed. I have here \na consent form prepared.\n  But I think we must keep in perspective that the reason many Federal \nemployees are not working is because the President has vetoed the \nInterior bill, the State, Justice, and Commerce bill, and the HUD-VA \nbill; and, also the fact that Labor-HHS has been tied up on the Senate \nfloor--I say this in no disrespect--because my colleagues on the other \nside of the aisle refuse to allow us to bring it up. We need 60 votes \nto do that. We only have 53.\n  So I want to continue to make the record that many Federal employees \nwould be working today had the President signed the bills.\n  In the meantime what we thought we might do--we tried to do this one \nother time and it was objected to--is in essence--we are in these very \nserious negotiations, good-faith, bipartisan negotiations--send the \nbills back to the President, which he vetoed, and then see if he will \nsign those bills, put people back to work, not temporarily but on a \npermanent basis, and then make the changes in this big agreement we \nhope to reach on each of those bills. But Senator Leahy objected to \nthat.\n  And then I was prepared to go through them one at a time and just \nsay, Well, let us send the Interior bill, and let us send the next bill \nand the next bill, for a total of six bills. But I am certain those \nwould be objected to.\n  But I just want the record to reflect that while we are not in \nagreement yet, I believe the White House, and I certainly believe the \nDemocratic leader, Senator Daschle, and I know this Republican, and I \nknow the Presiding Officer because he expressed his views earlier to \nme, would like to see this thing ended and Government employees go back \nto work and get paid. That is not going to happen, unfortunately, \ntoday. So it is not going to be a happy new year.\n  But we will meet the day after New Year's Day, on the 2d, and \nhopefully by then we will have some agreement that will pass the House, \nand they can start work by midweek.\n  Mr. DASCHLE addressed the Chair.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Democratic leader.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I share the view of the distinguished \nmajority leader that it is important to come back on Tuesday and make \nour best effort to resolve the impasse. I am confident that at least on \nthis side that can be done.\n  I would only remark very briefly that the President has indicated the \nway in which those bills could be signed. There is no reason why we \nwould have to have the impasse. We can negotiate our differences on \nthose bills just as we are negotiating our differences on the budget \nresolution. I hope we can do that sooner rather than later. We do not \nneed the impasse on these appropriations bills.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I thank my colleague.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/12/31/senate-section/article/S19323-2", "month": "12", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "31", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S19323-S19324]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  ORDERS FOR TUESDAY, JANUARY 2, 1996\n\n  Mr. DOLE.
