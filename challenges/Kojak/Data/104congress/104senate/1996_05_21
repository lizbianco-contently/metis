DR. RON MEHL\n\n  Mr. HATFIELD. Mr. President, it is my great pleasure today to \nintroduce to my colleagues Rev. Ron Mehl, pastor of Beaverton \nFoursquare Church. Over the past several years, I have joined the ranks \nof Reverend Mehl's admirers. Uncompromising leadership and commitment \nto God have enabled him to embody the Biblical mandate to ``speak the \ntruth in love.''\n  Reverend Mehl pastors Oregon's Beaverton Foursquare Church. Twenty-\nthree years under his gifted teaching have made this one of Oregon's \nhealthiest and most dynamic churches. Thousands sit in the pews of \nBeaverton Foursquare weekly. There are three services on Sunday, \nperhaps going to a fourth because of the tremendous turnout that holds \nsome 2,500 or 3,000 people in the church sanctuary.\n  When I am home, I count myself privileged to be one of many to hear \nReverend Mehl's Biblical preaching.\n  A man dedicated to pursuing God's calling, he has served in many ways \nover the years. Besides being a gifted preacher and counselor, Reverend \nMehl is a celebrated author of three books, one of which, ``God Works \nthe Night Shift,'' recently won the Evangelical Christian Publisher's \nGold Medallion Award in the category of ``inspirational.''\n  The Reverend Billy Graham, whom we recently honored, once said, ``The \ngreatest form of praise to God is the sound of consecrated feet seeking \nout the lost and helpless.'' Reverend Mehl has spent the majority of \nhis life doing just that--reaching out with the message of Christ and \nencouraging others to do the same.\n\n  In I Peter, the apostle writes, ``Each one should use whatever gift \nhe has received to serve others, faithfully administering God's grace \nin its various forms.--I Peter 4:10. Reverend Mehl is a faithful \nsteward of the gifts he has received and is an able administrator of \nGod's grace.\n  He has also been blessed by his wife Joyce and their two sons, Ron, \nJr., and Mark. I had the pleasure of getting to know Mark 3 years ago \nwhen he participated in my internship program. Mark's strong character \nshone through during his brief tenure in my office, a great tribute to \nhis parents in their rearing.\n  Again, on behalf of my Senate colleagues we are privileged that \nReverend Mehl is willing to fulfill the duties of Senate Chaplain \ntoday, and I would like to officially welcome him to this Chamber.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/05/21/senate-section/article/S5397-2", "month": "05", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "21", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5397]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                SCHEDULE\n\n  Mr. HATFIELD.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the pending \namendment before the Senate be temporarily set aside so that we can \nentertain two amendments by previous agreement, the first to be offered \nby the Senator from Michigan, the second to be offered by the Senator \nfrom North Carolina. Both have been cleared, and we can move ahead on \nthem. I would appreciate very much if the Chair would see fit to \nrecognize the Senator from Michigan at this time for his statement and \nthe introduction of the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Michigan [Mr. Levin] is recognized.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I thank the Chair. I thank my good friend from Nebraska.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4020\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, the sense-of-the-Senate amendment which I \nwill offer in a moment will put the Senate on record in support of \nsufficient funding in order that the National Institute on Drug Abuse, \nor NIDA, be able to continue to increase the pace of discovery of an \nantiaddiction drug, or drugs, in order to block the craving for illicit \naddictive substances.\n  This sense-of-the-Senate amendment expresses our sentiment that \namounts that are appropriated to the National Institutes of Health \nshould be increased by amounts above the fiscal year 1996 \nappropriations for this form of NIDA research. This effort is to \ndiscover antiaddiction drugs so that the craving which exists for them \ncan be blocked. The amounts in this sense-of-the-Senate resolution are \nbased on meetings and discussions with NIDA officials about what \nresources would be necessary to expedite the development of these \nillicit drug blocking agents, and the increase that would be \nrecommended here in the sense-of-the-Senate amendment would be $33 \nmillion in fiscal year 1997, $67 million for fiscal year 1998, and $100 \nmillion for each of the fiscal years 1998 through 2002.\n\n  There have been some significant breakthroughs already by NIDA. NIDA \nresearchers have recently shown that activation in the brain of one \ntype of dopamine receptor suppresses the drug-seeking behavior, whereas \nactivation of another triggers drug-seeking behavior. Another \nsignificant finding in this past year is the successful immunization of \nanimals against the psychostimulant effects of cocaine. In 1993, NIDA \nannounced the FDA approval of a medication called LAAM for heroine \naddiction. One of LAAM's\n\n[[Page S5399]]\n\nadvantages over methadone is that it does not need to be taken daily.\n  These are but a few of the exciting discoveries in drug abuse \nresearch that have been made over the past several years.\n  Stemming the tide of drug addiction by trying to find these \nanticraving substances is in the best interests of all of us, \nparticularly the innocent victims of drug-related offenses. We spend at \nthe State and local level and at the Federal level billions and \nbillions and billions of dollars to incarcerate people who commit drug-\nrelated offenses.\n  A 1992 report by the Bureau of Justice revealed that three out of \nfour jail inmates reported illicit drug use in their lifetime and more \nthan 40 percent had used drugs in the month before their offense, with \n27 percent under the influence of drugs at the time of their offense. A \nsignificant percentage also said that they were trying to obtain money \nfor drugs when they committed their crime.\n  More than 60 percent of juveniles and young adults in State-operated \njuvenile institutions reported using illicit drugs once a week or more \nfor at least a month during some time in the recent past and almost 40 \npercent reported being under the influence of drugs at the time of \ntheir offense.\n  The National Institute on Drug Abuse has presented us with some \nunprecedented opportunities to understand and to treat addiction and to \nblock craving. We should support that effort and the progress which has \nbeen made with a funding level which will enhance the efforts of NIDA \nto achieve these breakthroughs. We will all benefit. We will benefit in \nterms of our safety. We will benefit in terms of the Nation's resources \nif we can finally discover agents which will block the craving for \ncocaine and for other illicit drugs. NIDA does the majority of research \nin this area in the world.\n  So I hope that this sense-of-the-Senate amendment will be adopted \nwhich will put us on record as encouraging these additional funds so as \nto promote the efforts of the National Institute on Drug Abuse. I now \nwill send this amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Michigan [Mr. Levin] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 4020.\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following new section:\n\n     SEC.   . SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING THE NATIONAL INSTITUTE \n                   OF DRUG ABUSE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n       (1) The National Institute on Drug Abuse (hereafter \n     referred to in this section as ``NIDA'') a part of the \n     National Institutes of Health (hereafter referred to in this \n     section as ``NIH'') supports over 85 percent of the world's \n     drug abuse research that has totally revolutionized our \n     understanding of addiction.\n       (2) One of NIDA's most significant areas of research has \n     been the identification of the neurobiological bases of all \n     aspects of addiction, including craving.\n       (3) In 1993, NIDA announced that approval had been granted \n     by the Food and Drug Administration of a new medication for \n     the treatment of heroin and other opiate addiction which \n     breaks the addict of daily drug-seeking behavior and allows \n     for greater compliance because the patient does not need to \n     report to a clinic each day to have the medication \n     administered.\n       (4) Among NIDA's most remarkable accomplishments of the \n     past year is the successful immunization of animals against \n     the psycho-stimulant effects of cocaine.\n       (5) NIDA has also recently announced that it is making \n     substantial progress that is critical in directing their \n     efforts to identify potential anti-cocaine medications. For \n     example, NIDA researchers have recently shown that activation \n     in the brain of one type of dopamine receptor suppresses \n     drug-seeking behavior and relapse, whereas activation of \n     another, triggers drug-seeking behavior.\n       (6) NIDA's efforts to speed up research to stem the tide of \n     drug addiction is in the best interest of all Americans.\n       (7) State and local governments spend billions of dollars \n     to incarcerate persons who commit drug related offenses.\n       (8) A 1992 National Report by the Bureau of Justice \n     Statistics revealed that more than 3 out of 4 jail inmates \n     reported drug use in their lifetime, more than 40 percent had \n     used drugs in the month before their offense with 27 percent \n     under the influence of drugs at the time of their offense. A \n     significant number said they were trying to get money for \n     drugs when they committed their crime.\n       (9) More than 60 percent of juveniles and young adults in \n     State-operated juvenile institutions reported using drugs \n     once a week or more for at least a month some time in the \n     past, and almost 40 percent reported being under the \n     influence of drugs at the time of their offense.\n       (10) This concurrent resolution proposes that budget \n     authority for the NIH (including NIDA) be held constant at \n     the fiscal year 1996 level of $11,950,000,000 through \n     fiscal year 2002.\n       (11) At such appropriation level, it would be impossible \n     for NIH and NIDA to maintain research momentum through \n     research project grants.\n       (12) Level funding for NIH in fiscal year 1997 would reduce \n     the number of competing research project grants by nearly \n     500, from 6,620 in fiscal year 1996 to approximately 6,120 \n     competing research project grants, reducing NIH's ability to \n     maintain research momentum and to explore new ideas in \n     research.\n       (13) NIH is the world's preeminent research institution \n     dedicated to the support of science inspired by and focused \n     on the challenges of human illness and health.\n       (14) NIH programs are instrumental in improving the quality \n     of life for Americans through improving health and reducing \n     monetary and personal costs of illnesses.\n       (15) The discovery of an anti-addiction drug to block the \n     craving of illicit addictive substances will benefit all of \n     American society.\n       (b) Sense of the Congress.--It is the sense of the Congress \n     that amounts appropriated for the National Institutes of \n     Health--\n       (1) for fiscal year 1997 should be increased by a minimum \n     of $33,000,000;\n       (2) for fiscal year 1998 should be increased by a minimum \n     of $67,000,000;\n       (3) for fiscal year 1999 should be increased by a minimum \n     of $100,000,000;\n       (4) for fiscal year 2000 should be increased by a minimum \n     of $100,000,000;\n       (5) for fiscal year 2001 should be increased by a minimum \n     of $100,000,000; and\n       (6) for fiscal year 2002 should be increased by a minimum \n     of $100,000,000;\n\n     above its fiscal year 1996 appropriation for additional \n     research into an anti-addiction drug to block the craving of \n     illicit addictive substances.\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. EXON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska [Mr. Exon] is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. EXON. I thank my good friend and colleague from the State of \nMichigan, Senator Levin, for the amendment that I had indicated earlier \nhas been cleared on both sides. This is an important sense-of-the-\nSenate resolution, and I appreciate the cooperation we have had from \nSenator Levin and his staff on this matter.\n  We are about ready to have proposed in behalf of Senator Helms from \nNorth Carolina an amendment that likewise has been cleared on both \nsides. Then we can move the adoption of those by voice vote. Awaiting \nthe arrival of one Member on the Senate floor, I suggest the absence of \na quorum.\n  Mr. LEVIN addressed the Chair.\n  Mr. EXON. I withhold.\n  Mr. LEVIN. If the Senator will withhold, let me simply thank my good \nfriend from Nebraska and his staff and the staff on the Republican side \nwho have worked with us to clear this amendment. As always, I have had \ngreat response from my friend from Nebraska and the Republicans on this \nissue. It is an important issue for all America. I am grateful for \ntheir help.\n  Mr. EXON. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4018\n\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I wanted to add a word of support for the \nvery diligent effort of the Senator from Rhode Island and the \nbipartisan group he has gathered together to offer a budget \nalternative. I am very mindful of the remarks made by the distinguished \nSenator from New Mexico when he observed yesterday that such a change \nin budget, to be enacted, would literally require the President's help \nand support. Certainly we have learned this last year; that, indeed, \nprogress for reconciliation has to include the President. But I intend \nto vote for the Chafee amendment. I think it brings two factors to it \nthat are worth considering.\n\n[[Page S5400]]\n\n  First of all, it is bipartisan. It is the only major bipartisan \nproposal that is here and, I think, as such, has a chance of making it \nall the way through reconciliation.\n  Second, I am going to support it because, of the alternatives, it has \nthe strongest impact long term, that is beyond the 6-year window or the \n7-year window. Long term, it is significantly better in deficit \nreduction.\n  For those two reasons I salute the efforts of Senator Chafee, and I \nwill probably vote for it.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. EXON addressed the Chair.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4020\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair will inform the Senator that the \npending amendment is the amendment offered by Mr. Levin.\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, I am back to see if possibly we could at \nthis time clear the two amendments agreed to earlier. Has the amendment \nby the Senator from North Carolina been offered?\n  I am prepared to yield back time on the Levin amendment, which we \nwill agree to by a voice vote. I likewise assume we will move forward \nwith the amendment of the Senator from North Carolina, which I assume \nhas been cleared on both sides.\n  I yield back the remainder of the time on the Levin amendment.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Do I have the time in opposition? I yield back the time \nin opposition to the Levin amendment.\n  THE PRESIDING OFFICER. If there be no further debate, the question is \non agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 4020) was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4021\n\n(Purpose: To express the sense of the Senate regarding the extension of \n the employer education assistance exclusion under section 127 of the \n                     Internal Revenue Code of 1986)\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk on \nbehalf of Senator Helms. I ask for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from New Mexico [Mr. Domenici], for Mr. Helms, \n     proposes an amendment numbered 4021.\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place insert the following:\n\n     SEC.   . SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING THE EXTENSION OF THE \n                   EMPLOYER EDUCATION ASSISTANCE EXCLUSION UNDER \n                   SECTION 127 OF THE INTERNAL REVENUE CODE OF \n                   1986.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds that--\n       (1) since 1978, over 7,000,000 American workers have \n     benefited from the employer education assistance exclusion \n     under section 127 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 by \n     being able to improve their education and acquire new skills \n     without having to pay taxes on the benefit;\n       (2) American companies have benefited by improving the \n     education and skills of their employees who in turn can \n     contribute more to their company;\n       (3) the American economy becomes more globally competitive \n     because an educated workforce is able to produce more and to \n     adapt more rapidly to changing technologies;\n       (4) American companies are experiencing unprecedented \n     global competition and the value and necessity of life-long \n     education for their employees has increased;\n       (5) the employer education assistance exclusion was first \n     enacted in 1978;\n       (6) the exclusion has been extended 7 previous times;\n       (7) the last extension expired December 31, 1994; and\n       (8) the exclusion has received broad bipartisan support.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that the revenue level assumed in the Budget Resolution \n     accommodate an extension of the employer education assistance \n     exclusion under section 127 of the Internal Revenue Code of \n     1986 from January 1, 1995, through December 31, 1996.\n\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, this sense-of-the-Senate resolution calls \nfor the extension of a critical education tax provision that enables \nAmerican workers to further their education and better provide for \ntheir families. I have vigorously supported this education tax credit \nsince its initial authorization in 1978. This provision has allowed \nmillions of American men and women to acquire new skills and pursue \ntheir educational goals.\n  Our Government, being a republic, relies on the promotion of a moral \nand principled citizenry, education is central to the continued \nvitality of America. President Thomas Jefferson put it this way: ``If a \nnation expects to be ignorant and free, in a state of civilization, it \nexpects what never was and never will be.''\n  The Federal Government has promoted education and individual choice \nthrough the educational assistance exclusion, codified at section 127 \nof the Internal Revenue Code, a provision that allows employees to \nreceive up to $5,250 a year, tax-free, in educational benefits from \ntheir respective employers.\n  When this provision expired on December 31, 1994, it left many \nworkers and companies uncertain about the Federal Government's \ncommitment to the promotion of worker education and retraining. That \nuncertainty increased last year, when President Clinton vetoed the \nBalanced Budget Act that would have extended the credit through \nDecember 31, 1996.\n  Mr. President, over the years, this provision has enjoyed wide \nbipartisan support, resulting in its reauthorization seven times. I \nhope Senators will once again support extension of this education tax \ncredit which has done so much to help our Nation's workers and \nemployers alike. Accordingly, I offer today a sense-of-the-Senate \nresolution that provides that Congress should include, in any \nappropriate tax legislation, an extension of this critically needed tax \ncredit.\n  Neither the need for education nor the need for acquiring new skills \nstops when a young person receives a high school diploma. Increasingly, \neducation and worker training have become lifelong pursuits.\n  My home State of North Carolina has been hit hard by plant closings \nduring the last few years. The textile industry in my State has been \nparticularly hard hit as thousands of workers have lost their jobs. I \ncould cite eye-popping statistics as to the number of lost jobs but \nwhat is important to realize is that each one of these lost jobs \nrepresents an individual man or woman, often the lone breadwinner in a \nfamily.\n  Many workers are understandably concerned about job security. They \nworry about the possibility of losing their job and wonder how they \nwould provide for their loved ones if they did suddenly become \nunemployed. If this education provision is not reauthorized then \nmany more workers and their families, across the country, will suffer \nneedless anxiety and uncertainty.\n\n  Mr. President, while the Federal Government cannot set up programs to \nguarantee that every American has a job, we can act to ensure our Tax \nCode encourages workers and companies to act in their own interest by \npromoting education and training.\n  Without this exclusion, many employers may choose to end these \nbenefits for their employees. Those employers who do offer these \nbenefits will subject their employees to additional Federal and State \ntaxes. A fortunate few may be able to meet a complex IRS test to \ndemonstrate that the benefits are sufficiently job-related so as to be \ndeductible. These additional taxes can easily exceed 40 percent of the \namount paid by the employer. This enormous tax burden can be decisive \nin preventing an employee from pursuing an education to improve his or \nher career prospects and earning ability.\n  I support reauthorization of this provision because it empowers \nindividual employees and businesses by encouraging and promoting \neducation not through a monolithic Government bureaucracy but through \nthe removal of a harmful and destructive hurdle to the pursuit of an \neducation.\n  Over the years, this provision has helped more than 7 million working \nAmericans to further their education and to acquire additional skills. \nWhile the importance of this achievement to those individuals, their \nfamilies and their companies cannot be overstated, it is also true that \nthis accomplishment has served our Nation well.\n  Last week, the House Ways and Means Committee included an extension \nof the tax credit for employer provided education assistance in its \nmarkup of the Small Business Job Protection Act.\n  Mr. President, I do hope Senators will demonstrate their support for \nthe\n\n[[Page S5401]]\n\ncontinuation of this important provision and vote for this sense-of-\nthe-Senate resolution to reaffirm the Congress' commitment to improving \nthe education of American workers.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I understand this amendment is \nacceptable to Senator Exon, as the Levin amendment was to us; is that \ncorrect?\n  Mr. EXON. It is, and I yield back any time in opposition that we may \nhave on this side.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. And I yield back time Senator Helms has on the \namendment and ask for its adoption.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered. The amendment is agreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 4021) was agreed to.\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote by which the \namendment was agreed to.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, I ask for a vote on the Levin amendment that \nis now the pending amendment.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. We have adopted it.\n  Mr. EXON. Did we adopt that?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Levin amendment was adopted.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I move to reconsider the vote by which the Levin \namendment was agreed to.\n  Mr. EXON. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, how much time do we have on the Chafee-\nBreaux amendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 1 hour of debate equally divided.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. CHAFEE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island, [Mr. Chafee], \nis recognized.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I ask that the half-hour this side has be \ndivided in half, with half to me and the other half to the Senator from \nLouisiana.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4018\n\n  Mr. CHAFEE. I will take such time as I need.\n  Mr. President, in the years 1931 to 1938, the people of England \nfailed to heed the warnings that their nation and, indeed, their lives \nwere in peril. They dismissed voices, such as that of Winston \nChurchill, crying the alarm. They dismissed him as a warmonger and a \nscaremonger. Despite clear proof that Hitler was building a fierce war \nmachine, the people of Great Britain preferred to ignore such evidence. \nJohn F. Kennedy described that in his book, ``Why England Slept.'' And \nin his history of World War II entitled ``The Gathering Storm''--that \nwas the first volume--Churchill gave the theme of that volume as \nfollows:\n\n       How the English-speaking people through their unwisdom, \n     carelessness and good nature allowed the wicked to rearm.\n\n  Mr. President, a clear analogy can be drawn between the financial \nperil of the United States in the immediate years ahead and the \nmilitary peril of Great Britain in the years referred to, with one \nmajor difference.\n  No one disputes--no one disputes--the fiscal danger our Nation faces \nif we do not control these entitlements.\n  We hear a whole series of siren-like voices, gentle voices saying, \n``Don't do anything now. Let's have more study. Isn't there an easier \nway of correcting the situation? It's an election year, let's wait. We \ncan't do anything because we don't have the President's support.''\n  Mr. President, we can follow all that kind of advice, but it will not \ncure the situation one iota, and the only way to solve the financial \nproblem that this Nation faces is to do something about it now. Oh, \nsure, we can postpone it. Every year we postpone makes the solution \nthat much more difficult.\n\n  The solution of the centrist group has been, first, a realistic \nbudget that we do not have any savings that really cannot be achieved. \nWe do not say we are going to make these $300 billion savings out of \ndiscretionary accounts. We know that will not occur. Every Senator \nknows that will not happen.\n  So what we have done is said the solution to this is to state the \nCPI, the Consumer Price Index, in a realistic fashion, and we have not \ntaken the high side of the recommendations. Many of the witnesses that \ncame before the Finance Committee said the CPI is overstated by 1 \npercent at least and as high as 2 percent. But, no, we have gone to \none-half of 1 percent because that can be thoroughly justified.\n  Has there been criticism of that? Oh, yes, there has been criticism: \n``Savings from the CPI adjustment should not be used except to shore up \nthe Social Security fund.'' That is what we do, Mr. President. We have \na statement from the Social Security's chief actuary that the solvency \nof the Social Security trust fund, as a result of the CPI changes \nrecommended by the centrist group, will extend the solvency of the \nSocial Security fund.\n  Some say that if you change the CPI or go to a realistic correct \ntabulation of the CPI that you are going back on promises made to \nSocial Security recipients. That is absolutely inaccurate. Nothing in \nthe centrist plan affects commitments we have made to Social Security \nrecipients. Congress promised to provide cost-of-living adjustments to \nbeneficiaries, and we continue to do that under our plan. All our plan \ndoes is make the CPI correct.\n  Mr. President, I notice there are others waiting to speak, so I will \nreserve the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. BREAUX addressed the chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana, [Mr. Breaux] is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, it is my understanding we have 30 minutes \nfor the proponents and 30 minutes for the opponents.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. BREAUX. And we have agreed to divide 15 and 15 to each side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. BREAUX. I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from Florida.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida, [Mr. Graham] is \nrecognized for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I thank my friend from Louisiana. It is a \npleasure to have worked with the centrist coalition in the last several \nmonths in an attempt to develop a balanced budget based on a realistic \nset of principles.\n  In my limited time, I would like to make two points. First, if this \nCongress is serious about achieving what is stated to be its No. 1 \npriority, which is to develop a multiyear balanced budget plan that \nwould reduce the Federal deficit to zero at the earliest practical date \nand then to keep that deficit at zero for the foreseeable future, I \nsuggest that the vote that we are about to take on this centrist \ncoalition will be the ultimate test of our fidelity to that principle.\n  There is no other opportunity to pass a balanced budget in 1996 other \nthan that which is presently before the Senate. The reality is a \nbalanced budget will not be passed which is totally written by \nDemocrats. We established that fact in the early 1990's. A balanced \nbudget proposition will not be passed which is written and supported \ntotally by Republicans. We validated that truth in 1995.\n\n  We now have an opportunity to vote on a plan which represents a \nmoderate centrist perspective with support from significant numbers of \nSenators from a variety of philosophical and regional and economic \nbackgrounds which does have a meaningful chance to be adopted. That is \nthe fundamental question: Are we going to reject the good because it \nfalls somewhat short of our own personal view of the perfect, or are we \nto say that this good is so much better than the alternative, which is \nto continue to have these enormous Federal deficits and all of the \ndamage that they do to our Nation and to our individual lives? Are we \ngoing to miss the opportunity to get the benefits of a balanced budget, \nincluding the very substantial benefits of a lower interest rate over \nthe next decade than that which we will have if we do not exercise this \nact of discipline?\n  I believe, Mr. President, that the course of action which commends \nitself to this Senate is to adopt the centrist budget.\n  I would like to speak to one element of the budget which has received \nsome comment which I think is illustrative of the principles that \nunderlie the centrist approach. And that is that it is pragmatic, it is \ncompassionate and it\n\n[[Page S5402]]\n\nbuilds in structural changes that will help keep a budget once brought \nto balance in balance for the foreseeable future.\n  Our Medicare Program is in two parts. One part relates to hospitals \nand is financed through a trust fund supported by payroll taxes. The \nother part relates to physician's payments, and it is supported by a \npremium paid by the beneficiaries voluntarily.\n  If they do not wish to receive those physicians' services, they can \nelect not to do so and not to pay the premium. The balance is paid by \nthe general tax revenue of the Federal Government.\n  That premium has been set for most of the 1990's to be 31.5 percent \nof the cost of providing the physicians' services. Today it has dropped \nback to its pre-1990's level of 25 percent of the cost. That 31 \npercent, or today's 25 percent, is applied to all of the some 35 \nmillion-plus Medicare beneficiaries, the most affluent to the most \nindigent.\n  Our plan is based on, first, that we should raise from the part B \npremium, the premium for physicians' payments, the equivalent of 31.5 \npercent if that amount were applied to all of the 35 million \nbeneficiaries. But we should not distribute the premium across all \nbeneficiaries equally. Rather, it should be affluence tested.\n  We propose to have those Social Security beneficiaries who are under \n200 percent of poverty, which represents approximately 70 percent of \nthe beneficiaries, pay the current----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has used his 5 minutes.\n  Mr. BREAUX. I give 1 additional minute.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 1 additional minute.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Pay the current 25 percent. Those who are between 200 \npercent of poverty and $50,000 for an individual or $75,000 for a \ncouple will pay the 31.5 percent, which had been the premium level for \nthe first half of this decade. Those above the $50,000 or $75,000 per \ncouple, will pay a higher premium based on their income.\n  Mr. President, I believe that is fair, equitable, and compassionate \nand makes an important structural change in the Medicare system which \nwill help to preserve the long-term solvency of our Medicare system.\n  I cite this one example as illustrative of the approach that has been \ntaken throughout the centrist coalition budget. But the fundamental \nthing that recommends it is its bipartisan nature, the fact that it is \nreality, both economically and politically. This has a chance to \nactually pass, become law and make a difference in the lives of \nAmericans. I urge its adoption.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, I yield 4 minutes to the Senator from \nWisconsin.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin has 4 minutes.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, with this week's debate on the budget \nresolution, I believe the Senate has moved a giant step closer to \nimplementing a balanced budget. We are no longer debating whether we \nshould balance the budget. We are actually choosing between three \nseparate, complete balanced budget proposals: the Republicans' budget \nresolution, the President's balanced budget submission, and the \ncentrist coalition's bipartisan budget plan now pending as an \namendment.\n  The President's plan has already been defeated in a party line vote--\nnot a surprising result in an election year. We now have to decide \nwhether to adopt the Republicans' budget or the only bipartisan \nbalanced budget plan presented in the Senate.\n  If we are serious about setting the course for a balanced budget this \nyear, I think we must choose the centrist plan. The Republicans' \nbudget, as Yogi Berra said, is ``deja vu all over again.'' It is \nvirtually identical to last year's vetoed budget bill.\n  The Republican budget puts forth the same plan that was rejected last \nyear by the public and the President. This is the plan that guided us \nthrough a year of vetoes, gridlock, Government shutdowns, and stopgap \nspending measures.\n  Mr. President, we have a chance to redeem ourselves in the eyes of \nthe American public. They have seen 2 years of partisanship, bickering, \nand gridlock. In one vote we can send a message that we can work \ntogether in the spirit of bipartisanship, that we can bridge our \ndifferences and pass a budget that is honest, balanced, and fair.\n  That plan is the centrist budget now before us as an amendment. \nFirst, and most important, this is the only plan on the table that is \nbipartisan. It has been developed over the last half year by 11 \nDemocratic Senators and 11 Republican Senators. We have worked in a way \nthat I believe the American people want us to work. We have put aside \nour own political needs and party positions. We have compromised. Our \nprimary goal was a balanced budget--not a partisan victory. And the \nresult is an equitable budget plan that can win the support of a \nmajority of the American people.\n  The budget the centrists present today contains $679 billion in \nproposed savings over 7 years. Those savings are spread across almost \nevery group in society and almost every Government program. Our plan \nhas lower Medicare cuts than either the Republican or Democratic plans \nbut enough cuts to guarantee the longrun solvency of the program. Our \nplan contains a modest tax cut--$130 billion--that will allow us to do \nsome targeted tax credits for children and give businesses some capital \ngains relief. Our plan caps the out-of-control growth of entitlements \nthrough an adjustment in the CPI. And, most importantly, our plan \nachieves real and sustainable deficit elimination.\n  Mr. President, the centrists have put together a solid, bipartisan \nbalanced budget plan. I believe it is the best--and perhaps the only--\nchoice for those Members who want to see a balanced budget enacted this \nyear.\n  Mr. President, we know partisanship does not work. If we go down that \nroad again with a budget that only gets Republican votes, then we may \nsee some interesting campaign ads, but we will not see a balanced \nbudget.\n  We have a clear choice before us today. Vote for the centrist \namendment, and vote for bipartisanship, honest budgeting, shared and \nfair sacrifice, and the last, best hope for a balanced budget in this \nCongress. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I yield 3 minutes to the Senator from \nWashington.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington [Mr. Gorton], is \nrecognized for 3 minutes.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, the remarks beginning the debate this \nmorning on the part of the Senator from Rhode Island were directly on \npoint. Now is the time and this is the place for the oratory to end and \nthe true work in balancing our budget and building a brighter future \nfor our own generation, for our children and our grandchildren, is to \nbegin. There are no longer any real excuses.\n  A year ago, for the very first time for 20 or 30 years, this Congress \nactually passed a balanced budget that was then vetoed by the \nPresident. But that balanced budget changed the entire nature of the \ndebate. The President himself proposed a budget that was balanced, as \ninadequate as it was unfair, but nonetheless lip service to this \nproposition.\n  Again, this year we have before us from the Budget Committee, with my \nsupport, a budget that is truly balanced, but the execution of which \nwill almost certainly receive another veto from a President in an \nelection year.\n  This group, for the first time in a decade, two decades, three \ndecades, has gotten together, on a bipartisan basis, to solve the \ngreatest problem facing the United States of America, Democrats and \nRepublicans working together. It has a proposal that in the long run \ncreates a greater degree of financial stability and security for the \npeople of the United States than do any of the other proposals. Most \nMembers in this body would like to vote for it if they only believed \nthat it would become law.\n  But, Mr. President, we cannot tell whether or not it will pass the \nHouse of Representatives unless we pass it here in the Senate. We do \nnot know whether a President would respond to the dynamic of it passing \nboth Houses until it has passed both Houses. So the ball is in our \ncourt. If this is simply a good try that fails, we will be debating the \nsame issues over and over and over again, but we will not have done \nwhat we were supposed to do for the people of our country.\n\n[[Page S5403]]\n\n  If we pass it, maybe it will be defeated in some future place in this \npolitical debate in this election year. But maybe it will not. Perhaps \nit will build its own dynamic. Let us give it that opportunity, Mr. \nPresident. That is what we were elected to do.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time has expired.\n  Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, I inquire of the Chair how much time our \nside has.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana has 6 minutes left.\n  Mr. BREAUX. I yield myself 2 minutes.\n  Mr. President, yesterday a great deal of discussion was held about \nthe CPI adjustment. I just want to make a couple comments because many \nMembers said, ``We like your budget, but the CPI is something that we \ncan't handle. We don't think it's the right thing to do.''\n  We have had three hearings in the Senate Finance Committee--March 13 \nof last year, April 6 of last year, and June 5 of last year--we had a \nparade of economists before the Finance Committee. Every one of them to \na person said that we are making a mistake as a country. The \ndistinguished Senator from North Dakota said that yesterday.\n  Every year we make a mistake. Every year we give every person who is \non an entitlement program more than they should get, by every \neconomists' professional judgment. They say we overestimate what their \nincrease should be from anywhere between 0.7 and 2 percent.\n  So we have had the courage to make a decision that we will fix the \nproblem. We will correct the mistake. We will say that every person in \nAmerica who is entitled to an entitlement increase--Social Security, \nrailroad retirees, Federal retirees--we will give you a more accurate \nincrease in your benefits. For instance, in Social Security it says \ninstead of getting a $20-a-month increase, you will get a $16-a-month \nincrease. They still get an increase, a substantial increase. It is $4 \nless than they would have gotten under the incorrect formula, but \neverybody knows the formula is wrong. The formula has made a mistake.\n  Are there not enough people in this Congress to say that when we make \na mistake, we should correct it and recognize it? That is what we do in \nCPI.\n  I think everybody should enthusiastically stand up and say we want to \nguarantee everybody in this country gets an accurate increase based on \ninflation. When the formula is wrong, Congress should have the courage \nto at least correct the mistake. That is the only thing we do. It is \nsupported by a Republican economist, by a Democratic economist, and by \neverybody who has testified before the Senate Finance Committee. I \nthink it should be adopted.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time to the Senator from North \nDakota?\n  Mr. BREAUX. I inquire, Mr. President, how much time do we have \nremaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 4 minutes.\n  Mr. BREAUX. Senator Lieberman requested some time.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I am happy to give the Senator some of my \ntime.\n  Mr. BREAUX. We will give 3 minutes to Senator Conrad.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I thank Senator Chafee and Senator Breaux for this time.\n  Mr. President, what can be more clear? We are headed for a cliff. \nEveryone who has examined this question tells us we are headed for a \ncircumstance in which if we do not change course, we will either face \nan 82-percent tax rate in this country or a one-third cut in all \nbenefits. That is where we are headed. Make no mistake.\n  There are many things that must be done in order to prevent that \ncalamity from occurring. We must generate savings out of the various \nentitlement programs. We must cut other spending. All of those things \nmust be done.\n  Mr. President, with respect to the CPI that was criticized on the \nfloor last night, the technical correction in the Consumer Price Index \nthat our group has advocated on a bipartisan basis, this is a question \nof a mistake--a mistake. The Consumer Price Index is being used to \nadjust for cost-of-living increases, not just with respect to \nentitlement programs but also with respect to the revenue base of this \ncountry.\n  The economists have come to us and said, overwhelmingly, ``You are \novercorrecting by using the Consumer Price Index. It is not a cost-of-\nliving index.'' Even the people who draw it up at the Bureau of Labor \nStatistics will tell you it is not a cost-of-living index. Yet, that is \nwhat we are using it for. The economists tell us, because we are doing \nthat, we are making a mistake. They say the mistake is between 0.7 and \n2 percent a year, with the most likely overstatement being 1 percent.\n\n  What does that mean? Over 10 years, that means we are spending $600 \nbillion by mistake--by mistake. If we cannot correct a mistake around \nhere to address preventing the calamity that is going to occur, what \ncan we do? If this body and the other body and the President of the \nUnited States cannot correct mistakes to prevent a fiscal calamity, \nwhat can we do?\n  Mr. President, I think the question has to be, if not now, when? If \nnot us, who? If we cannot correct a mistake to prevent a financial \ncalamity, then we fail in our responsibility.\n  Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, I yield the remaining time we have, 4 \nminutes, to the Senator from Connecticut, Senator Lieberman.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I thank my friend and colleague from Louisiana. I \nthank my friend from North Dakota, who I am pleased to see this morning \nparaphrasing the words of the Talmud, which come strongly from his \nlips. I appreciate that sentiment.\n  Mr. President, I want to thank Senators Chafee and Senator Breaux for \nconvening this so-called centrist coalition. Frankly, it has been one \nof the most satisfying experiences I have had in the 8 years I have \nbeen in the Senate, because we did what I thought we came here to do, \nwhich was to forget that we are Democrats or Republicans, focus on the \nresponsibility that we have as Americans, elected by people from all \nparties in our State, and deal with central and obvious problems--and, \nin this case, most especially, the imbalance in our budget.\n  Sometimes when I look at the course that both parties are taking \nhere, frankly, on matters such as the budget, it seems to me it has \nbecome so highly politicized that we might as well have our press \nsecretaries staffing us on budget questions.\n  This centrist coalition attempted to find a third way. The group was \ndriven by the knowledge that if we truly want to balance the budget, it \nis going to take Members of both parties, working cooperatively, to do \nso.\n  Our group understands, I think, the first rule of compromise. It \nmeans you cannot always have your way, or, put more eloquently, as the \njunior Senator from Utah, Senator Bennett, did in quoting his father, \n``It means that you attempt''--and I love this expression--``to \nlegislate at the highest level at which you can obtain a majority.'' \nThat is perfect. That is just what we attempted to do in this group.\n  What does this proposal have? It faces the big problem in the budget \nwhich is that the so-called entitlements are skyrocketing. If we let \nthem go, they will eat up our Government and make it impossible for us \nto continue to do what people want us to do without grossly overtaxing \nthem. It approaches entitlement reform not in a weak and defensive way, \nbut by understanding that there is another side to this question.\n  Yes, as Medicaid and Medicare go up, people are benefiting, but \npeople are paying for them. Just to state it briefly in the time I \nhave, how can we explain to a worker, how can I explain to a factory \nworker in Connecticut making $30,000 a year that through his paycheck \nhe is paying for part A and through his tax bills, 75 percent of part B \nMedicare for a senior citizen retired, making $30,000 a year, with no \nkids to send through college or feed and clothe; or forget the \n$30,000--a senior citizen making $50,000 or $100,000 or $1 million. It \nis unfair to the people.\n\n  We have a reasonable number on discretionary spending, the most \nreasonable of any of the budget packages. Mr. President, we have a \nsensible tax cut program that will create growth, that stimulates \nsavings and investment through capital gains cuts and through some very \ncreative programs to encourage people to save more. Also, to\n\n[[Page S5404]]\n\nhelp the middle class in targeted areas, such as offering a deduction \nand help in sending their kids to college, which, at least in \nConnecticut, is the greatest burden I find the middle class is \nshouldering as I talk to them when I go around the State.\n  This is a solid, balanced, thoughtful program. Mr. President, 22 of \nus--11 Democrats, 11 Republicans--have put it together. I hope a lot of \nour colleagues surprise us and join us in getting this moving in the \nright direction toward balanced growth for our country.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I yield myself 2 minutes.\n  I have listened to the presentation of our amendment, and I must say \nI want to congratulate every Senator who has spoken on behalf of this \namendment. I think the arguments, really, are overpowering.\n  Here is the problem: If we continue on the path we are on now in this \ncountry, every one of the entitlement programs is going to be in a \nvery, very severe situation.\n  What did the entitlement commission say when they reported 2 years \nago? This is what they found: By the year 2010--how far away is that? \nMr. President, 2010 is 14 years away. Spending on entitlement \nprograms--Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, welfare, all of the \nentitlement programs--where they are locked in, unless we do something, \nthe payments on those programs, plus the interest on the national debt, \nwill exceed all the Federal tax revenues. All the money that comes into \nthe Federal Government will be inadequate to cover those entitlement \nprograms; not a nickel left for the Park System or for maintaining our \nhighways or for building them or the FBI, the State Department, the \nJustice Department, whatever it is.\n\n  Mr. President, obviously, something has to be done. I find the \narguments of the opponents difficult to understand. One of the \narguments is, ``Well, the President has not said he is for this thing, \nso we should not vote for it.'' What are we hired for? We are hired, it \nseems to me, to do what is best for the country, and whether the \nPresident is for it or is against it does not make any difference. He \ncannot vote here on the floor of the Senate. We can. It seems to me to \nmake our vote depending on whether this is going to pass or not and \nwhether the President is for it or not is hardly the route to go.\n  So I plead with my colleagues to come forward and support this \namendment.\n  Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays on the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I will take 1 more minute.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 1 more minute.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, here we have a chance to do something. In \nmy opening remarks, I mentioned the situation in England in the 1930's \nwhich John F. Kennedy described in his book ``Why England Slept.'' As \nWinston Churchill said in his four-volume history of the war, ``The \nGathering Storm,'' he said the English people through their nonwisdom \nand carelessness allowed the wicked to rearm.\n  We have a similar situation, not a peril from abroad militarily but a \nperil from within financially. The good news is we can do something \nabout it. What we can do now is the smartest; but, if we wait, it \nbecomes that much more difficult.\n  All we are saying is one-half of 1 percent correction, as it should \nbe and as every economist that has come before the Finance Committee \nhas told us the correction should be made. Let us seize the \nopportunity, Mr. President.\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. President, I am so very proud to join my colleagues \nin the centrist coalition in declaring my support for this bipartisan \nbudget resolution. Everyone in this Chamber should take a close look at \nour amendment. Reading this plan will be a frustrating and vexing \nexperience for the critics who are always anxious to label legislation \nas ``extreme'' or ``timid'' or ``too conservative'' or ``too liberal.'' \nNone of those tired old labels apply to this budget resolution.\n  This is truly a blueprint for a mainstream budget. It is the product \nof many weeks and months of compromise and negotiation and good old-\nfashioned ``give and take.'' On issue after issue, Republicans and \nDemocrats in the centrist coalition have resolved areas of disagreement \nby ``splitting the difference'' or ``meeting each other halfway.'' That \nis what legislating is all about.\n  For every element of this plan that Republicans don't like, there is \nanother provision that is equally troubling to Democrats. Under this \nbudget resolution, neither party would score a clear ``political \nwin''--but the Congress as a whole and, more importantly, the American \npeople would benefit tremendously if we adopt this mainstream approach \nto balancing the budget.\n  The most striking feature of our plan is that we do not shy away from \ncorrecting the inaccuracies in the Consumer Price Index [CPI]. We now \nhave almost universal agreement that the procedures currently used for \ncalculating the CPI are flawed, thereby resulting in a CPI that \noverstates inflation, according to the ``experts,'' by at least seven-\ntenths of a percentage point and perhaps as much as 2 percentage \npoints. Yet neither Republicans nor Democrats want to be the first to \ninclude a CPI correction in its budget.\n  By advancing such a correction in a bipartisan budget, neither party \nwill receive the full blame or the full credit, depending on how the \npublic responds, for addressing this issue. It is no secret that the \nAmerican Association of Retired Persons [AARP] and other seniors groups \nare almost violently opposed to a correction of the CPI. But we haven't \nheard yet from the masses of working people who will continue to ``pick \nup the tab'' for as long as we continue to use an overstated CPI.\n  We may well be pleasantly surprised by the public's reaction when \nthey find out that we can save $126 billion--as this centrist coalition \nplan proposes--by adopting a modest five-tenths of a percent reduction \nin the CPI over the next 7 years. This reduction is well below the \nofficial range, which extends from 0.7 to 2.0, by which the experts \ntell us the CPI is overstated. We adopt this modest figure precisely \nbecause we want to make clear that our motivation is to have an \naccurate CPI--and that our actions are not driven solely by budgetary \npressures.\n  Nonetheless, it is impossible to ignore the fact that this step would \nsave $126 billion over 7 years and, furthermore, that this represents \n$126 billion we would not have to cut from education, child care, \nhealth care, transportation, infrastructure, and other important \npriorities as we work to balance the budget.\n  It seems to me that all 100 Members of the Senate would leap in \nunison at the chance to embrace this provision, as well as the broader \npackage we are proposing. Being a realistic creature, however, I would \nbe satisfied if only 51 of us do so on this particular vote. I urge my \ncolleagues to join us in this bipartisan effort.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Who yields time?\n  Mr. DOMENICI addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Senator Domenici is recognized.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I yield myself 5 minutes off the resolution.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I want to give a report to the Senate about where we \nare and what things look like.\n  When we started this morning, we had 8\\1/2\\ hours on the resolution.\n  How much of that have we used this morning?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Fifty-seven minutes.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. So essentially we are now down to about 7\\1/2\\ hours. \nAssuming that time runs uninterrupted throughout the day, all time will \nhave expired pursuant to the unanimous consent request at 5:30 p.m. \ntoday. Pending at the start of today were 33 amendments that have been \nlaid aside. We have disposed of 15 amendments either by rollcall vote \nor voice. Therefore, as of this morning, we have considered 48 \namendments.\n  The consent agreement for first-degree amendments of last Thursday \nnight listed about 75 amendments. Therefore, there could be as many as \n27 first-degree amendments still to be considered. I am not at all \nsure, nor do\n\n[[Page S5405]]\n\nI in any way hold Senators to the amendments that they listed, but I \nthink we still have to find out a little more about them.\n  So I encourage Senators who have first-degree amendments left on this \nlist as of last Thursday night which we have not acted on yet to let \nthe managers know this morning if you still intend to offer the \namendments. I assume Senator Exon would join me in urging that they try \nto let us know this morning if they are going to call up amendments.\n  Mr. EXON. If we are going to have any order at all, we will have to \nhave that.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. So as I look down this list of amendments that have not \nyet been brought up, I conclude that after removing the duplicative \namendment--this is my own assessment--there are only 10 or 12 first-\ndegree amendments left. But I cannot reach that conclusion without the \nhelp of some Senators who are on that list.\n  Not counting any second degrees that may be considered, this should \ngive us hope that we can finish discussing all the amendments in the \n50-hour time period and maybe even start voting late this afternoon. \nThat depends upon whether it will be more accommodating to the Senate \nto vote all day tomorrow rather than to start tonight.\n  We need some guidance from Senators whose names and amendments are \nstill on this list. I think I can say as of now that there are very few \nRepublican amendments that are going to be called up off the list.\n\n  So I urge that the Democrat Senators that have amendments listed to \nlet us know. We are going to stay here during the funeral of Admiral \nBoorda right up until 12 o'clock when we recess for the policy, and we \nwill be in recess until 2:15. During that time, we will obviously do \nnothing here on the Senate floor. We are back in at 2:15.\n  If I have not used my 5 minutes off the resolution, I yield back \nwhatever time remains and yield the floor.\n  Mr. EXON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator from Nebraska yield time on \nthe pending amendment?\n  Mr. EXON. The Senator from Nebraska seeks time off the amendment.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I yield the Senator as much time off that as he needs. \nI am in charge of the opposition time. I will give him as much time as \nhe wants.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. EXON. I am about ready to yield 15 minutes to the Senator from \nMassachusetts, half of the time.\n  I will be allotted the half hour remaining on the pending matter. Is \nthat correct?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. If you want Senator Kennedy to have 15 minutes in \nopposition, I yield him 15 minutes.\n  Mr. EXON. Maybe we could settle something right now. I am not sure \nthat we should be in session during the important matter that is going \nto be taking place at the Washington Cathedral. I was just wondering if \nI might have the attention of my colleague. I am wondering if it might \nbe better for us to recess during the time of the memorial service with \nthe time being charged along the lines just outlined by the chairman of \nthe committee. I just say let us take that under advisement for now.\n  With that, if the Senator from Massachusetts could be recognized at \nthis time as previously arranged.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Let me take a minute off the resolution to respond.\n  I will be glad, in the next 10 minutes or so, to discuss this issue \nwith you. I think it is probably more important to your side than ours \nbecause we do not have very many amendments left. But if you want to \nuse time while the Boorda funeral is going on and charge it equally \nrather than a few of us remaining in the Senate, if you think that \nthrough and want to offer it to us, I am thinking I will probably agree \nto that.\n  Mr. EXON. We will visit about it. I hope the Senator from \nMassachusetts could be recognized at this time for 15 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Santorum). The Senator from Massachusetts \nis recognized.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I thank my friend, Senator Exon, for \nyielding 15 minutes. I yield myself 12 minutes.\n  Mr. President, during the course of this budget debate, there have \nbeen several proposed amendments expressing a fundamentally bad idea, \nand that is legislating a change in the Consumer Price Index. These \namendments have been offered as stand-alone, sense-of-the-Senate \namendments and as part of the centrist coalition budget. In fact, 20 \npercent of the total cuts in this budget come from a legislative \nreduction in the CPI.\n  That kind of arbitrary action by Congress would break faith with the \nelderly and make a mockery of the commitment of both parties not to cut \nSocial Security. It would raise taxes on low-income, working families \nqualifying for the earned-income tax credit and other working families \nas well. It would lead to lower wage increases for millions of workers \nthroughout the country at a time when one of the most serious \nchallenges our society faces is the decline in the living standards for \nall but the wealthiest families. Such a change would be harshly \nregressive in its impact. It would be unprecedented political meddling \nof what has been an impartial factual determination of the CPI.\n  Reducing the CPI would reduce cost-of-living adjustments for millions \nof Americans receiving Social Security benefits, military pensions, \nveterans pensions and civil service retirement. It would reduce the \namount of supplemental security income payments to the needy, and \nbecause of indexing of tax brackets, it would raise income taxes for \nmost taxpayers and reduce the earned-income tax credit.\n  Some may see a cut in the CPI as a magic bullet to balance the budget \nand avoid other painful choices, but it is a bullet aimed at millions \nof Americans who need help the most and who do not deserve this added \npain. It makes no sense to fight hard to save Medicare and then attack \nSocial Security. Legislating an arbitrary reduction in the CPI would \nclearly break the compact of Social Security. That compact says work \nhard, play by the rules, contribute to the system, and in turn you will \nbe guaranteed retirement security when you are old.\n  An essential part of that compact is a fair Social Security COLA so \nthat senior citizens can be sure that their hard-earned Social Security \nbenefits will not be eaten away by inflation. Overall, more than three-\nquarters of the lower spending under the change would come from cuts in \nSocial Security alone. Nearly all the rest would come from other \nFederal retirement programs. It is the elderly who pay heavily if \nCongress adopts this change.\n  Over the next 10 years, a half-percent cut in the COLA would reduce \nthe real value of the median income beneficiary Social Security checks \nby $2,650. By the 10th year, the real purchasing value of that check \nwould be 4.5 percent lower, making it even harder than it is today for \nsenior citizens to stretch their limited incomes to pay the bills for \nhousing, food and medical care, and other necessities.\n  Under the centrist budget, the median Social Security beneficiary \nwill see the value of the benefits they have earned cut by $1,200 over \nthe next 7 years. Let me repeat that. Under the centrist budget, the \nmedian Social Security beneficiary will see the value of the benefits \nthey have earned cut by $1,200 over the next 7 years.\n  Reducing the Social Security COLA is a direct attack on the \nretirement benefits that senior citizens have earned. If Congress is to \nrespect family values, it has to value families, especially the \nmillions of elderly families all across America.\n  Changing the CPI also affects the deficit by increasing taxes because \nincome tax brackets and the earned income tax credit are indexed to \ninflation. If the tax brackets are not adjusted for inflation, taxes go \nup and the earned income tax credit goes down.\n  Failing to adjust the tax bracket hits middle-income families the \nhardest. A family earning $36,000 would face a tax increase that as a \npercent of income would be more than four times as large as the tax \nincrease faced by a family earning $100,000. Hardest hit are the low-\nincome, hard-working families; 13 percent of the total tax increase, $6 \nbillion, would be paid by these low-income, hard-working families under \nthe centrist budget. Has not income inequality grown enough without \nlegislating another tax increase that disproportionately harms working \nfamilies?\n\n[[Page S5406]]\n\n  The impact of cutting the CPI reaches well beyond the Federal budget. \nIt is also a direct attack on the wages of working families. Many \nworkers have CPI adjustments in their collective bargaining contracts, \nbut every pay increase is affected by CPI. If the CPI is reduced by \nCongress, wages will be lower, too, for virtually all workers across \nthe country.\n  There is no greater source of dissatisfaction in American families \nthan the continuing erosion of their living standards. Except for the \nwealthy, the story of the past two decades has been, work harder and \nearn less. Cutting the CPI will make a bad situation even worse by \nputting even greater downward pressure on the wages of every American.\n  One argument made by the proponents of this idea of lowering the CPI \nis that it is merely an overdue technical correction that should be \nsupported as a matter of good government. This claim cannot pass the \ntruth-in-advertising test. The technical argument for lowering the CPI \nhas been made by the Boskin Commission, which was appointed by the \nSenate Finance Committee to examine the issue. The commission issued a \nreport in September of 1994 which identified several biases in the \ncalculation. The commission asserted that the CPI had overstated \ninflation by 1.5 percent a year. For the future, the commission \npredicted the CPI would be 1 percent a year too high.\n  The major problem with the commission's analysis is that the sources \nof bias it identifies are also identified by the nonpolitical, \nprofessional economists at the Bureau of Labor Statistics in the \nDepartment of Labor. They have the responsibility for setting the CPI \neach year. They do so fairly and impartially. They make periodic \ncorrections to take account of any biases up or down that affect the \nindex. The Bureau already plans to reduce the CPI by about two-tenths \nof 1 percent in 1997. This reduction is already assumed in the budget \nprojections for the next 7 years.\n  The issue is not whether there should be changes in the CPI but who \nshould make them and how large they should be. The Boskin Commission's \nwork is a poor basis for changing the CPI. As the Commission itself \nacknowledged, it did little original research. The Commission's \nmembership was stacked with economists who believed that the CPI was \noverstated. According to Dean Baker, an economist at the Economic \nPolicy Institute, all five members had previously testified they \nbelieved the CPI was overstated. Economists who gave contrary testimony \nwere excluded.\n  According to Joel Popkin, another expert on the CPI, the Commission \ncomprised five of the six witnesses before the full Finance Committee \nwho gave the highest estimates of bias. As Mr. Popkin also pointed out, \nthe interim report of the commission falls far short of presenting \nadequate justification for its conclusions, and therefore provides no \nbasis for Congress to change tax policies or entitlement policies such \nas Social Security.\n  In fact, for the elderly, the group most affected by any change, the \nmost authoritative study by the Bureau of Labor Statistics suggests \nthat the CPI may understate rather than overstate the true increase in \nthe cost of living because of the rapid increase in the medical costs \nfor the elderly.\n  To legislate an arbitrary change in the CPI would be unprecedented. \nIn the entire history of the CPI, the Congress has never tried to \nimpose a politically driven adjustment, and there is no excuse for \nimposing one now. Senior citizens and working families across the \ncountry depend on a fair CPI, and Congress should keep it that way.\n  Mr. President, I believe that that provision is unwise and \nunjustified. It provides, according to their own proposal, total cuts \nof $126 billion over 7 years. That will be a Social Security cut of \nsome $47 billion. It is going to amount to $1,205 for the median Social \nSecurity recipient, and it is going to reduce the value of the earned-\nincome tax credit by $6 billion.\n\n  Who are these people? They are men and women who are working, making \n$25,000 to $28,000 a year. That is where it is gradually being phased \nout. It is going to take $6 billion out of their resources.\n  The Democrats are over here talking about increasing the minimum \nwage. That is $3.2 billion a year. They are talking about taking $6 \nbillion out of families with children that are on the lower economic \nladder. To believe that these families are part of the problem in terms \nof what we are facing in this country, I think is unjustified and \nunwise.\n  Mr. President, I think the basic concept of legislating an adjustment \nin the CPI, that some are willing to accept and interject based upon \nthe Boskin Commission, which was basically flawed, is sending a very \npowerful message to our seniors. The elderly in this country are going \nto have a very real reduction in terms of their income over a period of \nyears.\n  It is sending a message to workers who are below the average median \nincome in this country that it is OK if they are going to lose some of \nthe protections they have now primarily focused on their children. It \nis going to send a general message to all workers across this country \nthat it is OK that they will see a reduction in their wages because \nmost of the contracts that are signed are tied to the CPI. Here we are \nin the Chamber of the Senate with just some votes effectively saying to \nworkers all across this country that their incomes are going to go \ndown.\n  So this is a very, very important aspect of what is allegedly the \ncompromise proposal. It is unwise. It is unjustified. I hope for that \nreason as well as others that the Senate will not accept that proposal.\n  I yield the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, we have had a wonderful presentation just \ncompleted about why this Nation does nothing about facing up to the \nproblems that confront us. Sure it is easy to trash any proposal that \ncomes before us. That is what we see. Not one word--not one word about \nwhat to do about the crisis our country faces in these entitlement \nprograms in the future years. I find it terribly disappointing that the \nSenator from Massachusetts chose this opportunity to go out of his way \nto trash all the proposals that we presented but not a word about doing \nsomething about it. Right here we had presented why the Congress of the \nUnited States refuses to face up to the problems we have before us.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, may I reclaim time to be able to respond \nfor 3 minutes? May I have 3 minutes to respond to the assault that the \nSenator from Rhode Island made upon me?\n  Mr. EXON. Reserving the right to object, we are trying to get \nsomething done here before 10:30. I thought we had an orderly process \ngoing on. But the Senator from Massachusetts, I think, is entitled to \nreclaim the time he yielded back, given the insertion of the remarks by \nthe Senator from Rhode Island.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. How much time did I yield back?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator yielded back 3 minutes.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I reclaim that time.\n  Mr. President, with all respect to my good friend from Rhode Island, \nin the various Republican proposals they had $4.4 trillion in, \neffectively, tax breaks for the wealthiest corporations and companies \nin this country. And, instead of finding that $100 billion over the \nperiod of the next 7 years from corporate welfare, from tax breaks that \ngo to the wealthiest individuals and corporations and drive American \njobs overseas, he is taking it out on the elderly and workers in this \ncountry. So I do not yield to those words of the Senator from Rhode \nIsland. When you start to get after corporate welfare, Senator, when \nyou start to support even what the administration talked about, $60 \nbillion, when we start having, in your proposal, something that is \nreducing that corporate welfare, then you will have some credibility in \nspeaking about that. Your proposal eliminates a minuscule $25 billion \nin corporate tax loopholes--$25 billion versus a tax cut of $100 \nbillion. In total, your proposal cuts over $270 billion in spending for \nthe elderly and the less well off through the Medicare, Medicaid, \nwelfare, and EITC programs. I have not heard you speak about these \nparticular issues and I reject the criticisms of the Senator from Rhode \nIsland.\n\n[[Page S5407]]\n\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. May I have 30 seconds?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, much has been said about CPI. I ask \nunanimous consent that at this point an article by Mr. Jim Klumpner on \nCPI bias be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n           Fact and Fancy: CPI Biases and the Federal Budget\n\n                         (By Jim Klumpner \\1\\)\n\n       Does the consumer price index have an upward bias? The \n     author believes that, while substitution and formula biases \n     exist, together they might amount to 0.3 to 0.5 percentage \n     points. Other alleged causes of bias are not considered \n     significant. The budget negotiators already have incorporated \n     substitution and formula adjustments in their baseline \n     assumptions. To go beyond this is an attempt to camouflage an \n     increase in taxes and a cut in Social Security, which could \n     be regressive and call for excessive sacrifice by the \n     elderly.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n     Footnotes at end of article.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n       On January 10, 1995, Federal Reserve Chairman Alan \n     Greenspan suggested that adjusting the Consumer Price Index \n     (CPI) for alleged upward biases might produce federal budget \n     savings measures in hundreds of billions of dollars. \n     Understandably, politicians and political commentators found \n     this very exciting, being largely unencumbered by technical \n     knowledge about it. Gobs of free money? Why didn't we notice \n     this before.\n       Within days, Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich let loose \n     with a typically vesuvial outburst: ``We have a handful of \n     bureaucrats who, all professional economists agree, have an \n     error in their calculations. But we can't tell these people \n     to get it right? If they can't get it right in the next \n     thirty days or so, we zero them out, we transfer the \n     responsibility to either the Federal Reserve or the Treasury \n     and tell them to get it right.'' \\2\\ Like his colleagues, the \n     Speaker was untroubled by subtleties, such as the conflict of \n     interest posed by having the nation's primary inflation \n     fighter control the data by which its performance is judged. \n     No matter; the quality of federal statistics had hit the \n     bigtime.\n       The situation to which this has now led holds rich ironies \n     for me. Both at the Senate Budget Committee and at the Joint \n     Economic Committee where I served previously, I have worked \n     with a few far-sighted Democratic members of Congress to \n     promote the integrity of the federal statistical system. By \n     and large, this effort consisted of defending agencies like \n     the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) from penny-wise but \n     pound-foolish budget cuts. We were privileged to have the \n     National Association of Business Economists as allies in this \n     effort, even though most NABE members probably wouldn't count \n     themselves as Democrats. Now all of a sudden, the cause of \n     quality statistics seems to have acquired a horde of new \n     allies, many of them Republican politicians. It reminds me of \n     a response that Robert Redford once gave when asked what it \n     was like to have gorgeous women flock to him: ``Where were \n     they before I became rich and famous?''\n       Unfortunately, the new allies of statistical integrity are \n     pursuing their cause with zeal and urgency typical of recent \n     converts. Politicians and journalists have been hazarding \n     wild, research-free guesses about the size of CPI bias and \n     proposing nonsensical ways to apply their new enthusiasm to \n     the budget. In this murky atmosphere, it is important that \n     economists at least see the issues clearly. As someone who \n     worked to address the problem of CPI bias before it became so \n     fashionable, I offer in this paper one view of the technical \n     issues, as well as some thoughts about how COLA adjustments \n     might figure in a deal to balance the budget.\n\n\n                          how big is the bias?\n\n       Various reputable analysts have made guesses about the size \n     of possible CPI biases, and their guesses span a rather broad \n     range. The BLS, which not only produces the CPI but also has \n     pioneered much of the research on potential biases, tends to \n     be at the low end of the range. They estimate very small \n     effects for the individual components of the overall bias, \n     which in their view totals about a half percentage point of \n     the annual inflation rate. This is similar to the conclusions \n     of the Congressional Budget Office (CBO), which argued for a \n     range of 0.2 to 0.7 percentage points in early 1995. Other \n     economists have advanced much higher estimates. Most \n     noteworthy is the 0.7 to 2.0-percentage-point range proposed \n     last September by a commission headed by Michael Boskin who, \n     I hasten to note, has long been an ardent advocate for \n     quality statistics.\\3\\\n       It should not be too surprising that respected economists \n     cite such a large plausible range for CPI biases, going from \n     almost nothing to 2.0 percent per year. After all, we are \n     trying to estimate the extent of our ignorance. This is the \n     classic boot-strap problem in philosophy. How can you measure \n     what you don't know, when you don't know what you don't know? \n     Of course, this uncertainty among the experts does little to \n     temper the certitude of others.\n       I tend to line up with the smaller bias estimates endorsed \n     by the BLS and CBO, and I find the very high estimates of the \n     Boskin commission implausible. Fortunately, there is fairly \n     wide agreement on what kinds of biases might exist. By going \n     through these components one by one, we at least can isolate \n     where differences in opinion lie.\n\n\n                           substitution bias\n\n       The substitution bias is one component of this problem on \n     which most analysts can agree. When the CPI is used as a \n     measure of the cost of living, it fails to capture consumers' \n     ability to change the ``market basket'' of things that they \n     buy. If the price of entertainment rises, for example, \n     consumers can offset the impact of this on their well-being \n     by purchasing more of something else, like food. A price \n     index with fixed expenditure weights like the CPI will \n     overstate the impact of rising prices for some items because \n     it fails to account for consumers' substitution of other \n     items whose prices have risen slowly or fallen.\n       When prices change by relatively small amounts over short \n     periods of time, substitution bias isn't much of a problem. \n     Over long periods of time, however, prices can drift \n     substantially up or down, leading to correspondingly large \n     changes in consumers' purchasing patterns. Thus, the \n     substitution bias grows over time. A widespread consensus \n     exists that the substitution bias averages about 0.2 \n     percentage points over the course of a decade.\n       BLS argues that they never intended the CPI to be a cost-\n     of-living index and that they are well aware that a fixed-\n     weight index suffers from substitution bias when used as a \n     cost-of-living proxy.\\4\\ Nonetheless, they have accommodated \n     the problem in the only way possible, i.e., with periodic \n     revisions of the expenditure weights to reflect more current \n     purchasing patterns. In the past, this was part of the BLS' \n     regular decennial rebenchmarking of the CPI.\n       Unfortunately, funds were not appropriated in a timely \n     fashion for the most recent rebenchmarking. As a consequence, \n     the new index will not be ready until 1998 rather than this \n     year, when it normally should have been introduced. Perhaps, \n     the newly found urgency concerning quality price statistics \n     will lead to more frequent and more regular rebenchmarking in \n     the future. For now, all of the participants in the budget \n     debate are assuming that the reported CPI will rise at least \n     0.2 percentage point less than it otherwise would have after \n     1998.\n\n\n                      formula bias and outlet bias\n\n       Formula bias results from the sample rotation procedures \n     used by BLS. The Bureau updates 20 percent of its surveyed \n     outlets each year in an effort to keep their mix of both \n     outlets and items more current. Past BLS procedures, in \n     combination with fixed expenditure weights, gave improper \n     weights to items whose prices are especially volatile. For \n     instance, if an item happened to be on sale when the update \n     was made, its fixed expenditure share corresponded to a \n     temporarily overstated number of units, because of its \n     temporarily depressed price. When the item's price returned \n     to a more ``normal'' level, the impact of that price increase \n     was overstated because it was multiplied by an inflated \n     number of units. Similarly, items whose prices were \n     temporarily high were undervalued, as was the subsequent fall \n     of that price to a ``normal'' level.\n       The BLS became aware of the formula bias some time ago and \n     has been working to correct if for the past couple of \n     years.\\5\\ They are replacing their previous procedures with a \n     ``seasoned'' sample, which should more accurately distinguish \n     short-term price volatility from enduring price change. BLS \n     expects that this work will be complete by January 1997. When \n     the budget negotiators became aware of this, Senators Dole \n     and Domenici and Congressmen Gingrich and Kasich officially \n     requested that BLS predict what the future results of their \n     current research would show. Though somewhat uncomfortable \n     with the request, BLS responded that they guessed the formula \n     bias was between 0.1 and 0.3 percentage points, and the \n     budget negotiators have now built this assumption into \n     their baselines as well.\n       The Boskin commission's September report also argued that \n     there is an outlet bias, distinct from formula bias, that \n     they believe adds another 0.2 percentage points to reported \n     inflation. As noted above, the sample rotation procedure is \n     intended partly to ensure that the outlets surveyed are those \n     at which consumers actually shop. BLS is confident that there \n     is no outlet bias independent of the formulas bias. Indeed, \n     it seems unbelievable that the price division at BLS could \n     remain ignorant of K-Mart, Price Club and CompUSA when these \n     firms spend millions of advertising dollars to make certain \n     that the rest of us are aware they exist.\n       The commission's incorrect ideas about outlet bias and \n     somewhat higher estimate for formula bias probably are the \n     inadvertent results of the haste with which the September \n     report was put together. It is unfortunate that the \n     commission had time for only the briefest of briefings from \n     the BLS analysts who work full-time on the CPI. Greater \n     familiarity with what the Bureau actually is doing might have \n     avoided these misunderstandings, as well as some of the \n     unrealistic notions about quality adjustment discussed below.\n\n\n               quality change bias and new products bias\n\n       Most of the differences between economists' estimates of \n     CPI bias stems from different views about quality change bias \n     and new products bias. For instance, the Boskin commission's \n     September report claimed that\n\n[[Page S5408]]\n\n     these two effects probably accounted for about 0.5 percentage \n     point of bias and might account for as much as 1.3 percentage \n     points. I would argue that the effect of these two factors is \n     close to zero.\n       The basic concept underlying these two effects is quite \n     straightforward. Quality change bias occurs when the \n     characteristics of an item change at the same time that its \n     price changes. Some of the price change should be attributed \n     to the new characteristics, but some should be interpreted as \n     a change in the price of the old characteristics. If the new \n     item is in some sense twice as good as the old item and its \n     price is also twice as high, the item's quality-adjusted \n     price should not change.\n       The issue of new products bias is conceptually similar \n     because consumers face a new range of offerings in the \n     marketplace, just as they do when product quality changes. \n     For instance, the proper way to analyze the introduction of a \n     new drug that replaces a surgical procedure might be to \n     compare the characteristics of these two treatments, both of \n     which are expected to have the same therapeutic result. With \n     both quality adjustment and new products, we need to \n     distinguish ``pure'' price change from the part that reflects \n     consumers' enhanced welfare due to new market options.\n       One notable paper argues that the flux of new offerings \n     available in the marketplace is itself a significant \n     contributor to consumer welfare, even if the items are not \n     all that new.\\6\\ The paper arrives at this conclusion by \n     examining the case of Apple-Cinnamon Cheerios. The conclusion \n     seems to derive from estimating the considerable surplus \n     generated by marching down the demand curve from its \n     intersection with the price axis to the place where it \n     intersects the supply curve.\n       What appears to drive the analysis, however, is the \n     assumption of imperfect competition, which implies that \n     increased purchases of Apple-Cinnamon Cheerios don't merely \n     displace other cereal purchases and the consumer surplus \n     associated with them. It seems unreasonable to believe that \n     households stock an ever-increasing quantity of breakfast \n     cereal to accommodate the dizzying variety of new offerings. \n     Most people can only eat just so much cereal.\n       Discussion of quality adjustment and new products bias \n     raises a similar metaphysical puzzle to the one mentioned \n     earlier in this article. After all, ``quality'' is usually \n     distinguished from ``quantity'' because it is essentially \n     nonquantifiable. How then should we measure something that we \n     already have defined as essentially unmeasurable? For \n     example, one of the most striking aspects of Windows software \n     is the fact that its prettier than DOS. There is no obvious \n     way to attribute a specific portion of the program's price to \n     this improvement in quality.\n       In addition, economists like to believe that everything can \n     be reduced to market prices, even though this clearly is \n     untrue for a wide range of public goods for which markets \n     fail. For instance, the required installation of smog \n     controls on autos raises their price. It is doubtful that \n     individual consumers perceive this as an improvement in the \n     quality of their cars, though all of us may benefit from the \n     cleaner air that results. How does one put a value on the \n     improvement in air quality when there is no private market \n     for clean air? How should we evaluate new antitheft devices \n     on cars that compensate for rising fear of crime?\n       As a practical matter, BLS already makes a serious attempt \n     to adjust for quality changes where they believe them to be a \n     problem.\\7\\ If both the old and new models of some item exist \n     in the market at the same time, the difference between the \n     prices can be used to estimate the proper quality adjustment. \n     For some other items, the BLS attempts to measure directly \n     the additional cost of added attributes, as they did with \n     smog equipment on autos. Neither of these procedures is \n     perfect, but the imperfections necessarily result from the \n     inherent unmeasurability of quality itself.\n       One procedure for handling quality adjustment that BLS \n     sometimes employs and that appeals to most economists is \n     called the ``hedonic'' technique. This involves regressing \n     past prices of an item on past changes in its \n     characteristics. The coefficients from such a regression are \n     then used to attribute some of the item's current price \n     change to current changes in characteristics, with the \n     residual being ``pure'' price change. It is fairly tricky to \n     decide on a comprehensive set of independent variables so \n     that the results do not suffer from omitted variables bias. \n     This is a particular danger because any important \n     unmeasurable factors necessarily will be omitted by their \n     very nature.\n       Another serious practical difficulty in making quality or \n     new product adjustments, whether hedonic or not, is cost. \n     Large quantities of auxiliary data must be collected for each \n     adjusted item, and highly trained econometricians must be \n     hired to do the analysis. Furthermore, it is hard to know \n     where to stop, short of comprehensive quality adjustment for \n     every item in the CPI. It is safe to say that BLS does as \n     much quality adjustment as their appropriations allow. The \n     political process should provide the necessary funds if there \n     now is a burning desire for more.\n\n\n                         arguing from anecdote\n\n       Because there hasn't been a comprehensive research effort \n     to adjust a broad range of items in the CPI or to account for \n     newly introduced goods, arguments in these areas usually rely \n     on anecdote. The danger in arguing from anecdote, of course, \n     is that an anecdote may seriously misrepresent the more \n     general case. I believe that this is the source of error in \n     the very high estimates for quality adjustment and new \n     product biases of the Boskin commission and others.\n       The commission's September report explicitly notes that \n     most of the evidence for upward price bias due to these two \n     factors comes from nonauto consumer durables. The report \n     cites VCRs, televisions, microwave ovens and PCs as hallmark \n     examples. However, Table 1 shows that nonauto consumer \n     durables account for only 4.2 percent of the expenditure \n     weights in the CPI. House furnishings, which can hardly be \n     said to show rapid increases in quality, account for 3.5 \n     percent of spending, leaving only 0.7 percent of monthly \n     expenditures for the whiz-bang stuff. This very low weight \n     stems not from low prices for these items but from the fact \n     that they are infrequently purchased.\n       Such tiny expenditure weights for the goods with which we \n     typically associate quality improvement must imply \n     astronomical rates of improvement in order to justify the \n     quality bias assumed by the Boskin commission and others. For \n     example, if goods imparting quality bias to the CPI represent \n     only 1 percent of the index, then their quality would have to \n     improve at 100 percent per year in order to arrive at a 1.0-\n     percentage-point bias. The new PC that I bought this year \n     certainly is better than the one I bought six years ago, but \n     it's not sixty-four times as good. Advertisers' gaseous \n     claims notwithstanding, the new PC has not revolutionized my \n     life nor had an important impact on my well-being.\n       The problem of small expenditure weights is especially \n     important for new products bias. Newly introduced items \n     necessarily have tiny expenditure weights because they are \n     novelties. The Boskin commission's report complains that \n     ``the microwave oven was introduced into the CPI in 1978 and \n     the VCR and personal computer in 1987, years after they were \n     first sold in the marketplace.'' \\8\\ Even now, however, these \n     items have weights measured in hundredths of a percentage \n     point and properly so. Many households do not even own PCs, \n     microwaves and VCRs, let alone Salad-Shooters. Those who do \n     own such items purchase them only infrequently. It is this \n     that gives them a tiny weight compared to things like rent \n     and food, which loom large in the average consumer's budget. \n     BLS must make a judgment about when new items comprise a \n     sufficiently large proportion of expenditures to justify \n     inclusion in the CPI. The evidence for these high-profile \n     examples suggests that the Bureau's judgment has been \n     correct.\n\n\n                Table 1.--CPI expenditure weights, 1995\n\n\nDurable Goods......................................................10.6\n                                                               ________\n\n  New Vehicles......................................................5.1\n  Used Vehicles.....................................................1.3\n  House Furnishing..................................................3.5\n  Other Durables....................................................0.7\n                                                               ========\n\nNondurable Goods...................................................32.8\n                                                               ________\n\n  Food and Beverages...............................................17.4\n  Apparel...........................................................5.1\n  Other nondurables................................................10.3\n                                                               ========\n\nServices...........................................................56.6\n                                                               ________\n\n  Shelter..........................................................28.0\n  Utilities.........................................................7.0\n  Medical Care Services.............................................6.0\n  Other Services...................................................15.6\n\nSource: Bureau of Labor Statistics.\n\n       I have focused my arguments about quality adjustment and \n     new products bias on the 0.7 percent of the CPI that the \n     proponents of large bias adjustments usually cite. Perhaps \n     there are other components of the CPI with larger expenditure \n     weights that have had significant quality improvements but \n     have been ignored. Let's see.\n       new motor vehicles account for 5.1 percent of the CPI. The \n     Boskin report itself notes that the case for quality \n     adjustment bias here is murky. They cite the ambiguity of \n     balancing the negative quality adjustment for decreasing auto \n     size with the positive adjustment for improved fuel \n     efficiency, itself a function of the (declining) price of \n     gasoline. Used vehicles, which make up 1.3 percent of the \n     index, probably did show some upward drift in quality in \n     the past, but BLS has taken steps to account for this \n     since 1987. As mentioned above, household furnishings (3.5 \n     percent of expenditures) probably haven't shown \n     appreciable quality improvements, and new furniture in \n     particular seems to have become cheesier in my opinion.\n       What about nondurables? Food and beverages account for 17.4 \n     percent of the index. Staples like meat, poultry, fish, eggs, \n     milk, cheese, fruits, vegetables, sugar, flour, etc. may have \n     seen some improvements in freshness and selection, although \n     rising salmonella contamination should give pause. Prepared \n     foods may have shown some quality improvements but not much. \n     Other nondurables are mainly apparel (5.1 percent) and \n     various other goods like fuels, tobacco and school supplies \n     (10.3 percent), for which quality improvements would seem \n     trivial.\n\n[[Page S5409]]\n\n       What about services, which account for 56.6 percent of \n     expenditures? A whopping 28.0 percent of the typical \n     consumer's budget is taken up with shelter. Here, the Boskin \n     report acknowledges that there was a serious downward price \n     bias in the past that resulted from BLS' inadequate \n     adjustment for aging and depreciation. This downward bias in \n     the CPI's largest single item has been corrected by the \n     Bureau. Utilities account for 7.0 percent of spending, and \n     there certainly has been little improvement here except for \n     phone service.\n       Medical care services are another 6.0 percent, and the \n     situation here is a bit ambiguous. Services for medical \n     crises clearly have improved, although these expenditures are \n     infrequent by their very nature, and the out-of-pocket costs \n     for the average consumer are rather small on a monthly basis. \n     On the other hand, routine visits to the doctor have become \n     pretty annoying. Certainly, if there has been progress in the \n     quality of medical care, it has had only marginal effects on \n     morality, morbidity and lost work time.\n       The anecdotal evidence for the remaining 15.6 percent of \n     spending that goes to other services suggests deterioration \n     as often as improvement. Declining test scores certainly \n     aren't reassuring to consumers wondering if they're getting \n     their money's worth for out-of-pocket education expenses. \n     Smaller airplane seats and deteriorating public \n     transportation also suggest declining quality. Shoe-box movie \n     theaters with dinky screens and stale popcorn have not \n     brightened the movie-going experience. The shopping \n     experience itself is less pleasant, and haircuts are about \n     the same. Of course, there are improvements in the quality of \n     some consumer service, notably ATM banking.\n       The point here is not whine nostalgically that nothing is \n     as good as it used to be. Rather, I am arguing that once we \n     get away from a few high-profile examples related to \n     infrequently purchased household appliances, even the \n     direction of quality adjustment is ambiguous at best. There \n     is no question that modern market economies produce a great \n     deal of flux in the range of products offered, but many of \n     the offerings are meretricious rather than meritorious. To \n     say that all of this change represents an inexorable \n     improvement in the average consumer's quality of life is \n     panglossian.\n       Once one looks at the relative importance of different \n     items in the CPI and the actions that BLS already has taken \n     to address quality adjustment and new products problems, the \n     very high estimates of these biases become unbelievable. I \n     would argue that, if these factors do impart an upward bias, \n     it is a couple tenths of a percentage point at most. The most \n     important spending for the average household still has to do \n     with basic human needs: shelter, food, clothing, \n     transportation and basic health care. The great quality \n     improvements in these areas were achieved long ago. Current \n     quality advances largely are limited to items that clearly \n     are accessories to our lives or to situations that occur only \n     rarely.\n       In sum, then, I believe that the very large overall bias \n     that some analysts allege distorts the official CPI is about \n     one-third science and about two-thirds virtual reality. A \n     firm consensus exists regarding the substitution and formula \n     biases, both of which BLS already is working to eliminate. \n     With regard to the alleged outlet bias, some analysts appear \n     to be misinformed about what BLS actually does. And with \n     regard to quality adjustment and new products bias, large \n     effects appear to result from overly enthusiastic \n     extrapolation, if not wishful thinking.\n\n\n                 the cpi's effect on the federal budget\n\n       As noted at the beginning, the whole reason that these \n     issues have come to popular attention is that small changes \n     in the rate at which government spending programs and taxes \n     are indexed can have huge effects on the federal deficit. The \n     great attraction of fiddling with the CPI is that it can be \n     used to extract money from literally millions of taxpayers \n     and benefit recipients. Table 2 shows CBO's official \n     estimates of the budget savings that would result from \n     reducing CPI indexing by a full percentage point. Seven-year \n     cumulative savings amount to $281 billion, with an impact of \n     almost $82 billion in FY 2002. About a third of the money \n     comes from higher income taxes, another third comes from \n     Social Security, almost a fifth comes from reduced debt \n     service and the rest comes from other federal retirement \n     programs, EITC and SSI.\n       It is easy to see how attractive it is for \n     budget negotiations to scale back indexing under the guise \n     of statistical integrity. The budget negotiators already \n     have incorporated baseline changes corresponding to a 0.4-\n     percentage-point adjustment to account for BLS's existing \n     efforts to eliminate substitution and formula biases. The \n     arguments above suggest that going beyond this is \n     scientifically questionable. However, this is exactly what \n     is being debated as this is being written in December \n     1995: an additional ad hoc adjustment to account for \n     purported (though unmeasured) quality and new product \n     bias. This seems to be an attempt to use statistical \n     subtleties as a figleaf for increasing income taxes and \n     cutting retirement benefits.\n\n                     TABLE 2.--REDUCTION OF DEFICIT FROM 1.0 PERCENTAGE POINT CPI ADJUSTMENT                    \n                                            [In billions of dollars]                                            \n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                              1996      1997      1998      1999      2000      2001      2002  \n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nRevenues..................................       1.8       5.5       9.8      13.1      17.7      23.0      27.1\nOutlays...................................       3.1       8.4      14.1      20.2      26.5      32.7      39.8\n  SS, RR retirement.......................       2.6       6.2      10.1      14.1      18.4      22.8      27.4\n  Other retirement........................       0.3       1.2       2.1       3.1       3.8       4.7       5.6\n  SSI, EITC...............................       0.2       1.0       1.9       3.0       4.3       5.2       6.8\n  Offsets.................................       0.0      -0.1      -0.2      -0.4      -0.7      -1.0      -1.4\nDebt service..............................       0.2       0.8       2.0       4.0       6.7      10.2      14.7\nTotal deficit reductions..................       5.0      14.7      25.9      37.3      50.9      65.9      81.6\n                                                                                                                \n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nSource: Congressional Budget Office.                                                                            \n\n       That's not to say that reducing indexing should be \n     considered a totally unacceptable tool for deficit reduction. \n     It does mean that we should be honest about what we are \n     doing. What is being proposed this year used to be called a \n     ``diet COLA,'' a catchy term that distinguishes nicely \n     between ad hoc changes and those based on scientific \n     research. Scaling back indexing is not a ``correction'' of \n     the CPI and does not ``reduce'' the CPI. One Republican \n     senator offered and then withdrew an amendment to this year's \n     Budget Resolution that BLS ``shall reduce the annual percent \n     change in the consumer price indexes by 0.7 percentage \n     points.'' (emphasis added) No mention here about just how \n     that might be done, but plenty of confidence that science was \n     on his side.\n\n\n         the effects of a diet cola on the income distribution\n\n       Whether or not a diet COLA ought to be included in a \n     comprehensive budget deal depends upon the same criteria as \n     any other deficit reduction tool: How is the burden of \n     deficit reduction apportioned across society, and will there \n     be collateral effects that are unpalatable? Thus, we don't \n     ask that the budget be balanced by eliminating the Defense \n     Department, because it would be unfair to ask the defense \n     sector to bear the entire burden of deficit reduction and \n     because it would leave the nation without defenses.\n       In this regard, it is important to note that the diet COLA \n     is regressive on balance, extracting relatively large budget \n     savings from low-income households and relatively small \n     amounts from the well-to-do. Table 3 shows CBO's estimates of \n     a diet COLA's impact. It is important to note that the \n     adjusted family income concept used in the table includes the \n     employer's share of payroll taxes for Social Security and \n     unemployment insurance as well as CBO's attribution of the \n     corporate income tax by income class. As a consequence, the \n     income concept also is adjusted for family size, but that has \n     a much smaller impact on the distributional conclusions.\n\n                            TABLE 3.--DISTRIBUTIONAL EFFECTS OF REDUCED CPI INDEXING                            \n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                                      Share of   Share of   Share of            \n                                                                      revenue    spending    total     Number of\n                 Adjusted, pretax family income \\1\\                    change     change     change    families \n                                                                     (percent)  (percent)  (percent)  (millions)\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nLess than $10,000..................................................        0.9       10.5        6.0        14.6\n$10,000 to $20,000.................................................        7.7       20.1       14.2        18.5\n$20,000 to $30,000.................................................       11.6       17.5       14.7        16.6\n$30,000 to $40,000.................................................        9.5       14.4       12.1        13.5\n$40,000 to $50,000.................................................        7.7       10.3        9.1        10.8\n$50,000 to $75,000.................................................       18.3       14.3       16.2        17.7\n$75,000 to $100,000................................................       16.1        6.0       10.8         8.6\n$100,000 to $200,000...............................................       17.0        5.4       10.9         7.0\nOver $200,000......................................................       11.3        1.2        6.0         1.0\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\\1\\ Adjusted income is the sum of wages, salaries, self-employment income, rents, taxable and nontaxable        \n  interest, dividends, realized capital gains, and all cash transfer payments.

Fully 56 percent of the burden falls on \n     families below $50,000 per year, who constitute 57 percent of \n     all families. The table also shows that the effect on the tax \n     side is mildly progressive, but this is offset by both the \n     regressivity and larger impact of the spending side.\n       Clearly, this creates problems for those politicians who \n     care about the income distribution. It is one thing for the \n     diet COLA to be included as one part of a deficit reduction \n     plan that is progressive in its overall profile. However, it \n     is quite another thing to\n\n[[Page S5410]]\n\n     add a diet COLA to a budget plan that already is regressive \n     in its overall effect.\n       As this is being written, a group of fiscally conservative \n     Democrats, known as the Coalition or Blue Dogs, has proposed \n     a clever device that mitigates the regressive effect of the \n     diet COLA on the spending side. As with other diet COLAs, \n     they suggest that the cost-of-living adjustment for \n     various spending programs be keyed to the official CPI \n     minus some specified factor, like 0.5 percent. However, \n     they would also stipulate that the reduced COLA received \n     by all individual beneficiaries of a program be equal to \n     the dollar amount for the average beneficiary. This means \n     that those beneficiaries who are better off would receive \n     a diet COLA that also was a smaller percentage adjustment \n     than otherwise. Some beneficiaries well below the average \n     would actually come out ahead.\n\n\n          the effects of the diet cola on the age distribution\n\n       Part of the reason that the diet COLA has such a severe \n     effect on very low income families is that the indexed \n     spending programs are almost entirely retirement programs and \n     elderly households tend to have low incomes. This highlights \n     another distributional issue for those who care about such \n     things: the impact of the diet COLA on the age distribution. \n     Here again, the question is not just its effect on the \n     elderly but whether that effect compounds sacrifices called \n     for elsewhere in the deficit reduction plan.\n       The proposals being offered in the budget negotiations \n     already get the bulk of their savings from Medicare and \n     Medicaid. All Medicare spending and about a third of Medicaid \n     spending goes to support health care for the elderly. In \n     fact, about half of all nursing home expenditures are paid \n     for by Medicaid. The most severe budget plans propose sharp \n     cuts in service at the individual level because projected \n     program growth would be insufficient to cover increases in \n     the medical costs and the number of beneficiaries.\n       Adding a diet COLA, with its heavy impact on retirement \n     programs, to any budget plan with large Medicare and Medicaid \n     cuts would be doubly severe for the elderly. These are \n     citizens who have few options with regard to working longer \n     or harder to offset the effect of cuts. They also tend to \n     have fewer health care options, because the medical attention \n     that they usually need is acute care and it often is too late \n     for preventive care. Expecting the elderly to take a leading \n     role in medical cost containment through individual choice \n     also seems unrealistic, because they may see choice as \n     threatening and confusing rather than liberating. Using a \n     diet COLA to get additional budget savings on top of the \n     sacrifices from the elderly already being contemplated \n     strikes me as unjust.\n       There is another important reason to think that price \n     indexing should not be scaled back for retirement programs. \n     Research suggests that these programs actually have been \n     underindexed in the past because spending patterns for the \n     elderly differ from those of consumers in general. Two years \n     ago, the BLS reformulated the raw data underlying the CPI to \n     take account of the different expenditure weights in the \n     ``market basket'' of the typical older consumer.\\9\\ The \n     results shown in Table 4 indicate that this reconfigured \n     index for the elderly increased by 4.1 percentage points, or \n     8.2 percent, more than the official CPI between December 1982 \n     and December 1993. This resulted from the greater weight of \n     out-of-pocket medical expenses for the elderly and the \n     smaller weight for transportation, apparel, and restaurant \n     meals. Of course, out-of-pocket medical expenses for the \n     elderly would become an even larger item in the household \n     budgets of the elderly under most of the deficit reduction \n     plans being discussed.\n\n TABLE 4.--DECEMBER TO DECEMBER CHANGE IN OFFICIAL CPI AND EXPERIMENTAL \n                       PRICE INDEX FOR THE ELDERLY                      \n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                            Experimental\n                                                             price index\n                                                   CPI-U       for the  \n                                                 (percent)     elderly  \n                                                              (percent) \n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n1983..........................................         3.8          3.7 \n1984..........................................         4.0          4.1 \n1985..........................................         3.8          4.1 \n1986..........................................         1.2          1.8 \n1987..........................................         4.4          4.5 \n1988..........................................         4.4          4.5 \n1989..........................................         4.6          5.2 \n1990..........................................         6.3          6.6 \n1991..........................................         3.0          3.4 \n1992..........................................         3.0          3.0 \n1993..........................................         2.7          3.1 \n1982-93.......................................        49.7         53.8 \n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nSource: Nathan Amble and Ken Steward, ``Experimental price index for    \n  elderly consumers,'' Monthly Labor Review, May 1994.                  \n\n       The BLS researchers stressed that one would need a much \n     more comprehensive effort to create a reliable CPI for the \n     elderly. In particular, one would have to discern whether \n     they shop at the same kinds of outlets as younger consumers \n     and whether they purchase the same kinds of items. Anecdotal \n     evidence suggests that they don't and the divergence between \n     the CPI and the cost of living for the elderly might be even \n     greater if these factors were taken into account. It appears \n     that the elderly tend to shop more at neighborhood stores \n     rather than discount outlets and that they have limited \n     options to save by buying in bulk.\n\n\n                               conclusion\n\n       As a longtime proponent of better statistics, the sudden \n     awakening of interest in price measurement issues is \n     gratifying. However, I am dismayed that this has not been \n     accompanied by an equal commitment to fund or even to \n     acknowledge the analytical effort needed to address these \n     issues sensibly. The public discussion of the CPI's biases \n     has been carried away on a tide of outrageous claims that \n     have little scientific basis. Most disturbing is the \n     apparent willingness to make arbitrary adjustments to one \n     of our most important economic indicators rather than \n     improve it with more frequent updates and careful \n     research.\n       Very large estimates of CPI bias that range as high as two \n     percentage points appear to result from ignorance about what \n     the CPI actually contains and what the BLS actually does. \n     Full-time professionals responsible for properly surveying \n     the mix of outlets certainly are aware of the giant discount \n     chains familiar to the rest of us. Claims that BLS has not \n     addressed the most important quality adjustment issue are \n     patently false. Speculations about huge quality bias seem to \n     result from extrapolating the characteristics of household \n     appliances that average consumers buy once every few years to \n     the much larger and more prosaic spending that they do every \n     month. Arguing that the CPI ignores the great benefits of new \n     product introductions probably fails to note that most such \n     ``new'' products are merely new styles.\n       A solid scientific consensus does exist regarding \n     substitution bias and formula bias. Not surprisingly, BLS \n     already is moving to correct these biases. The Bureau also \n     attempts to correct for quality adjustment and new product \n     biases within the constraints of their budget. Although there \n     is no convincing evidence that quality biases are large for \n     items that they do not adjust, BLS undoubtedly would welcome \n     additional resources for more extensive and sophisticated \n     research. Presumably, they also would be happy to have funds \n     for more frequent rebench- marking and more frequent sample \n     rotation.\n       The budget negotiators already have incorporated \n     adjustments in their baseline assumptions to account for the \n     two most firmly established components of the CPI bias; \n     substitution and formula bias. Going beyond this is not \n     justified by firm evidence. To do so while claiming a \n     scientific justification amounts to an attempt to camouflage \n     an increase in taxes and a cut in Social Security. A diet \n     COLA should not be adopted as part of a deficit reduction \n     plan that already is likely to be fairly regressive unless \n     some effort is made to counter the regressive effects. In \n     addition to remediating the income regressivity of the diet \n     COLA, one also would need to ensure that it was not part of a \n     deficit reduction plan that called for excessive sacrifice by \n     the elderly, whose retirement benefits may well have been \n     underindexed in the past.\n\n\n                               footnotes\n\n     \\1\\ Jim Klumpner is chief Minority Economist, U.S. Senate \n     Budget Committee, Washington, DC.

Mr. President, today a grateful nation pays its final \ntribute to a true patriot and hero, Admiral Jeremy ``Mike'' Boorda, who \ndied on\n\n[[Page S5411]]\n\nThursday, May 16, 1996, at the age of 56. There will be a memorial \nservice today at the Washington Cathedral to honor Admiral Boorda. I \nwant to take this opportunity, on behalf of many of my colleagues on \nboth sides of the aisle, to honor this man and his truly vital \ncontributions to our Navy. His service to our Nation was a model to \nwhich every American could aspire.\n  Admiral Boorda was a high school dropout who joined the Navy at the \nyoung age of 16 as a seaman recruit. After rising to become a petty \nofficer first class in 1961, at the urging of a chief petty officer, \nMike Boorda applied for admission to an enlisted commissioning program, \nbut he had no confidence of success. He was selected on his second \napplication and commissioned an officer in 1962.\n  In 1991 he received his fourth star and became the commander-in-chief \nof Allied forces in Southern Europe. As CINCSOUTH, he was in charge of \nan air strike in February 1994 against four Bosnian Serb aircraft \nflying in violation of the U.N. ban on fixed-wing flights. This was the \nfirst time that a NATO commander had ordered alliance forces to use \ndeadly force on an offensive mission in the organization's 44-year \nhistory.\n  On April 23, 1994, Admiral Boorda became the 25th Chief of Naval \nOperations. He assumed command of the world's greatest Navy while it \nwas still suffering from the aftermath of the Tailhook scandal. Despite \nTailhook, a rash of cases of sexual misconduct, and several plane \ncrashes, Mike Boorda tackled all these problems with energy that many \nof us could not match. Why? Because Mike Boorda loved the Navy.\n  He once said, ``I stayed in the Navy because I love going to sea. I \nhope everybody is experiencing that. If you're fortunate enough to be \nat that stage in your career where you still get to go to sea, relish \nit. Enjoy it and have fun. Realize that you are a part of a long line \nof people who have gone down to the sea in ships, and it's a special \nthing to do.''\n\n  Mike Boorda was a ``Sailor's Sailor.'' He devoted his life to making \nour Nation more secure and to securing a better life for those who \nserve our country. As the only sailor to rise from E-1 to become Chief \nof Naval Operations, he knew what it meant to be at the bottom and top \nof the chain of command. This experience instilled in him an unwavering \ndesire to help sailors and their families serve proudly and live in a \nmanner in which they could be proud.\n  He was a man of both physical and moral courage. From Southeast Asia \nto Bosnia, he was willing to put his life on the line to serve his \nNation, but he was also willing to put his career on the line for the \nsailors he loved and the principles he stood for: duty, honor, and \ncommitment.\n  Admiral Boorda's entire Navy career was marked by a single \ncharacteristic--compassion. He cared more for others than he ever cared \nfor himself. He cared more for his Navy than he ever cared for his Navy \ncareer. All that he did and all that he gave will live on forever in \nthe men and women that he loved so much.\n  More than anything, he loved being around sailors. When he went on \nboard a ship or walked into a room full of sailors, you could see the \ntwinkle in his eyes and a caring smile come across his face. He made \nsailors and their families feel better about themselves and better \nabout what they did. He used to say almost everyday, ``we have the best \nsailors in the world, let's treat them that way.'' His love of sailors \ndrove him to personally talk with more than 200,000 sailors, and visit \nmore than 100 of the 360 ships in the fleet in his 2 years as CNO.\n  As I said earlier, he was a man of the sea, he believed that going to \nsea, getting underway, was about the most special thing one could do. \nHe used to joke that he would like to change places with the younger \nofficers so he could return to driving ships and personally leading \nsailors. He prided himself on his ship handling skills and talked often \nabout how much it meant to him to be considered one of the best ship \ndrivers in our Navy.\n\n  Like most sailors, he was a storyteller. He loved to captivate an \naudience with a yarn about his days at sea, or about his family, \nespecially his grandchildren. Almost everyday at his office, he would \ncome in with a new tale about what one of his grandchildren had done or \nhow something reminded him of when he was a young seaman or junior \nofficer. He had a way about him, so that when he spoke, everyone would \ninstinctively rise and fall on his every word.\n  He was a man of great humor and of great humility. At serious \nmeetings or in tense congressional hearings, he would break the tension \nwith his dry and self-effacing sense of humor. He also never spoke of \n``I''--he only spoke of ``we''--when talking about what our Navy had \naccomplished. He would go to great lengths to ensure that others were \nnot embarrassed or publicly humiliated when things went wrong. He \nalways took responsibility for the bad, and always avoided praise for \nthe good.\n  Admiral Boorda was a visionary in naval strategy. When he became CNO, \nhe recognized that the post-cold-war era required a strategy that \nretained the Navy's tradition of forward presence, but he also knew \nthat it was much more likely that we were going to fight near land, in \nthe world's littorals. He transformed the Navy's approach to meet this \nnew strategy situation in ``Forward . . . From the Sea,'' the strategy \nthat will carry the Navy into the 21st century.\n  He was a visionary in technology. He spearheaded such projects as the \narsenal ship, the new attack submarine, theater ballistic missile \ndefense, and cooperative engagement capability. These programs, and \nmany others, put the Navy on the cutting edge of technology and did so \nin a way that was efficient, affordable, and flexible. He also \nrecognized our Navy needed a strategy to accompany emerging technology, \nso he developed ``2020 Vision,'' a long range plan for acquiring and \nusing future technology to achieve our strategic objectives.\n\n  Because he cared so much about his sailors, he took real steps to \nimprove their lives: He significantly increased military housing \nstarts. He fought for and achieved pay raises and increases in BAQ \namounts and eligibility. Despite significant cuts in ships and sailors, \nhe was able to prevent a rise in the deployment time of sailors. He \nrevamped the officer and enlisted evaluation system so that it provided \nclear standards and accurately reflected performance, and he \nsuccessfully integrated women into combatant ships and aircraft \nsquadrons.\n  Like many of my colleagues, I have had the privilege of working \nclosely with Adm. Mike Boorda for several years. I came to admire him \nimmensely--his intelligence, common sense, energy, sense of humor, and \nmost important, his commitment to our Navy, our country, and his \nfamily.\n  Admiral Boorda once said of Adm. Arleigh Burke, ``he defined what it \nmeans to be a naval officer: relentless in combat, resourceful in \ncommand, and revered by his crews. He was, indeed, `a sailor's \nsailor'.'' I think Admiral Boorda also exemplifies these words.\n  Adm. Mike Boorda was a man who loved his country and served it with \ndistinction from the age of 16 to the day he died. He was an American \nsuccess story and a hero who will be missed by all of us.\n  Mr. President, I submit this resolution and ask for its immediate \nconsideration.\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, I yield myself as much time as I am in need \nof off the resolution.\n  I thank Senator Lott. I am a cosponsor of the amendment. It is very \nappropriate. We, on this side, join in and thank him for honoring the \nmemory of Mike Boorda, our dear and departed colleague who we shall all \nmiss very much. Thank you, Senator Lott, for the excellent statement in \nbehalf of all of us in the U.S. Senate.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the resolution be \nagreed to, the preamble be agreed to, the motion to reconsider be laid \nupon the table and any statements relating to the resolution appear at \nthe appropriate place in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The resolution (S. Res. 255) was agreed to.\n  The preamble was agreed to.\n  The resolution, with its preamble, reads as follows:\n\n                              S. Res. 255\n\n       Whereas Admiral Jeremy M. ``Mike'' Boorda was the 25th \n     Chief of Naval Operations;\n\n[[Page S5412]]\n\n       Whereas as the Chief of Naval Operations, Admiral Boorda \n     commanded the foremost Navy in the World;\n       Whereas Admiral Boorda's career in the Navy reflected his \n     lifelong dedication to the United States and to the \n     principles he held dear--duty, honor, and commitment;\n       Whereas Admiral Boorda is the only member of the Navy ever \n     to rise from the lowest enlisted grade to the position of \n     Chief of Naval Operations, and his rise gave him a full and \n     unique perspective on the opportunities and obligations of \n     command;\n       Whereas this perspective instilled in Admiral Boorda an \n     unwavering concern for the members of the Navy and their \n     families;\n       Whereas as Commander-in-Chief of NATO forces in Southern \n     Europe, Admiral Boorda ordered the first offensive use of \n     deadly force in the history of NATO, an air strike in \n     February 1994 against four Bosnian Serb aircraft flying in \n     violation of a United Nations ban on such flights;\n       Whereas Admiral Boorda was a visionary in naval strategy \n     who recognized that circumstances in the post-Cold War era \n     made necessary a strategy that retained a forward presence \n     for the Navy even as it recognized that future Navy \n     operations would most likely occur in the littoral zones of \n     the world;\n       Whereas this strategy, which Admiral Boorda called \n     ``Forward . . . From the Sea'', will serve as the basis for \n     Navy strategy well into the 21st century;\n       Whereas Admiral Boorda was a visionary in naval technology \n     who spearheaded programs for the development of the arsenal \n     ship, the new attack submarine, theater ballistic missile \n     defense, and cooperative engagement capabilities;\n       Whereas these programs, and many others spearheaded by \n     Admiral Boorda, put the Navy on the cutting edge of \n     technology and did so in an efficient, affordable, flexible \n     manner;\n       Whereas Admiral Boorda recognized the need for the Navy to \n     develop a strategy for utilizing emerging technology \n     effectively and developed in response to that need the plan \n     known as ``20/20 Vision'', a long-range plan for the \n     acquisition and utilization of technology in the future in \n     order to achieve the strategic objectives of the United \n     States; and\n       Whereas it is fitting that Admiral Boorda be remembered as \n     he described Admiral Arleigh Burke when saying that ``. . . \n     he defined what it means to be a naval officer: relentless in \n     combat, resourceful in command, and revered by his crews . . \n     . He was, indeed, a sailor's sailor.'': Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate honors Admiral Jeremy M. ``Mike'' \n     Boorda for a career that included extraordinary contributions \n     to the defense of the United States and a singular commitment \n     to the members of the Navy and thereby exemplified all the \n     best qualities in an officer in the United States Navy.\n\n  Mr. LOTT.

The Senator from Nebraska is recognized.\n  Mr. EXON. I thank the Chair.\n  Madam President, suffice it to say, we are now ready for business. If \nthere is any Senator who wishes to offer an amendment, this is an \nopportune time to do it.\n  The basic situation is this: We have approximately 4 hours left under \nthe agreement. That is 2 hours on each side. We have a large number of \namendments still outstanding and Senators have not indicated to either \nmanager of the bill whether the amendments are actually going to be \noffered or not.\n  I suppose the question is being asked, ``Well, when are we going to \nstart voting?'' As of now, the time will run out on the resolution \nsometime between 6 o'clock and 6:30. I suggest we could not start \nvoting before that time, unless time is yielded back. But my experience \nhas been that normally time is not yielded back. At the end, we have \nSenators clamoring for time and, yet, the time will have run.\n  So it appears now, unless time is yielded back, that we could not \npossibly start voting any earlier than 6, probably sometime after that. \nThere is an event scheduled tonight that is absolutely going to prevent \nus from being here and holding rollcall votes, I would think, much \nafter 6 o'clock. So I think it is safe to say we should get over here \nand get our work done. Maybe we can get one or two rollcall votes in \nbefore we adjourn for the day, but certainly that is not assured.\n  It appears to me now, that we are looking at not more than one or two \nrollcall votes--if that, and a whole series of individual rollcall \nvotes, maybe 20 to 40, somewhere in that neighborhood, are a \npossibility for tomorrow and the days and hours that follow. When \nSenator Domenici comes to the floor--and I think he will be here \nshortly--he may have some additional information because he will be \ncalling the shots.\n  So, once again, in the absence of anyone offering an amendment or \nseeking recognition at this time, I suggest the absence of a quorum, \nwith the time to be charged equally to each side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The clerk \nwill call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KYL.

Madam President, I thought since we are in a quorum \ncall I might just briefly summarize since time is being charged to both \nsides--and this will be charged to our side--several amendments that I \nhave introduced just to focus colleagues' attention on those \namendments.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator from Nebraska yield time?\n  Mr. EXON. How much time does the Senator from Minnesota need?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Five minutes.\n  Mr. EXON. I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from Minnesota.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota is recognized.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3985\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Madam President, I actually laid down these amendments \non Friday. But I thought since we have a quorum call and time is being \ncharged to both sides--this charged to our side--I want to focus \nattention on several of the amendments that I laid down Friday. One of \nthose amendments which was a leadership amendment--and I compliment the \nChair for her very, very important work dealing with higher education--\nwas an amendment that I introduced as a sense of a Senate that any tax \ncuts beyond tax credits for children and families ought to go for an \nannual up to $10,000 deduction that families can take to help pay for \nthe cost of higher education, and that would include tuition, and also \nthe interest that families find themselves paying on the debt.\n\n  That interest is extremely important because now, unfortunately, as \nopposed to at least when I went to school, about 80 percent of the \nfinancial aid packages are now loans as opposed to grants. It used to \nbe quite different. It has flip-flopped in the last 15 years, or so. I \nhope that this money will go to higher education making it more \naffordable for families, or it has to go to deficit reduction.\n  I hope that this amendment really will receive strong bipartisan \nsupport. I laid the amendment down as an education Senator. Most of my \nadult life has been devoted to education. I laid this amendment down as \na leadership amendment for my party. But, frankly, I think this is an \namendment that is important to the Democrats and Republicans alike. \nSince we are going to have a rapid succession of votes on lots of \namendments, I just wanted one more time to focus attention on this \namendment.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3987\n\n  The second amendment that I might talk about very briefly was an \namendment that I introduced at the beginning of 104th Congress and, \nfrankly, I regret that it was passed finally on a voice vote. It just \nsimply said that the Senate was taking the position that we would not \npass any legislation that would create more hunger or homelessness \namong children. I actually lost on the vote on that amendment twice, \nand then it was passed by a voice vote. But given some of the budget \nproposals and given some of the, I think, fairly rigorous independent \nstudies that have taken place suggesting that as a matter of fact we \nare in part taking some actions that will create more poverty among \nchildren, this time around I want to get a recorded vote.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3986\n\n  A third amendment I introduced, which is one that the Senator from \nDelaware has actually taken the lead on, just simply said that we ought \nto make a commitment that we will provide the full funding called for \nin the community police program--the COPS Program.\n  I have to say to you, Madam President, that I have never received \nmore positive reports with any Federal program in Minnesota than the \nCOPS Program. A one-page form filled out by COPS going to Washington \nwith money coming directly back to police chiefs and sheriffs used for \nreally fine proactive preventive, important--not feel-good law \nenforcement--a real focus on domestic violence, a real focus on some of \nthe neighborhoods most ravished by violence in our cities, and a real \nfocus on youth, on some of the kids that are in the most trouble, not \nexclusive just to cities but in rural communities as well. So I hope \nthat there will be very, very strong support for that.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3989\n\n  And then finally one other amendment that I want to talk about very \nbriefly--one that my colleagues are probably less familiar with but I \nthink it is an important amendment. And again, the Chair has taken real \nleadership on this. This issue has become unfortunately a more \nimportant issue in this country, and this issue deals with the central \nimportance of our taking the steps that we need to take as a nation to \nreduce violence in homes.\n\n  This amendment says that in the welfare reform we do we must allow \nStates to take into account the special circumstances of a mother and \nher children who have been in homes where there has been violence; who \nhave been battered. In other words, one size does not fit all. And my \nfear is that, if we are not careful, what we are going to do in the \nwelfare reform area is we are going to be essentially saying to a \nmother that you have to work, and if you do not work that is it, \nwithout taking into account what has happened to her.\n  Remember. It took Monica Seles 2 years to play tennis again after \nwhat happened to her. What is going to happen is we are going to force \nsome of the women and children back into very dangerous homes? We have \nto take into account these circumstances. There have been several \nstudies. The Taylor Institute came out with a study suggesting that a \nshockingly high percentage of welfare mothers in welfare to workfare \nprograms right now have had to deal with this violence. So we must take \nthat into account in the welfare reform area.\n  I have used up my time. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BIDEN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3985\n\n  Mr. BIDEN. I ask unanimous consent that I be able to proceed for up \nto 5 minutes on an amendment No. 3985.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n[[Page S5414]]\n\n  Mr. BIDEN. Thank you, Madam President.\n  Madam President, this is the amendment to which the Senator from \nMinnesota spoke relating to the tax deductibility for up to $10,000 for \nhigher education payments. A number of us have introduced separate--and \nsome together--bills and sense-of-the-Senate resolutions to accomplish \njust that.\n  The President I believe in his State of the Union called for such \ntreatment. I would just like to reiterate what my friend from Minnesota \nsaid.\n  First of all, this is only a resolution. I wish it were an up-or-down \nvote on a legislative initiative to change the tax law to allow parents \nand/or students to deduct up to $10,000 of the costs of a college \neducation. That is the cost which most people are focusing in on. But, \nit is not just 4-year colleges. It can be a 2-year college. It can be a \npostgraduate undertaking.\n  I hear my friends--and I know that the Presiding Officer is younger \nthan I am but we are not that very far off, the four of us on the floor \nhere--I hear people of our generation say how they worked their way \nthrough college. I worked my way through college. I was able to get \nsome financial help and some scholarship money as well as help from my \nparents. But I worked my way through college. But do you know what? The \nminimum wage was $1.25 cents, and the total cost to attend our State \nuniversity, the University of Delaware, was $325 a semester for \ntuition. You could work your way through college if you were willing to \nwork.\n  It always fascinates me when I hear people my age--I am now 53--talk \nabout, ``Why don't they do what we did--work our way through school?'' \nbecause now the minimum wage is under $4.50 an hour. And to go to that \nsame great university, my alma mater, is going to cost them about \n$6,000 if they are an in-State student. If you are unfortunate enough \nto have children like many of us do here who decide--and are able--to \ngo to an institution other than the State institution which I attended, \nyou will find that their tuition and room and board is $25,000 a year, \nif they go to Georgetown University, which one of my sons attended, or \nto Yale where another son is. That is $25,000 a year. We do not all go \nthere. Most of us, as in my case, could not get there.\n  I am very proud of my State university, and proud of having gone \nthere. But the truth of the matter is when my dad and mom were helping \nme get there, and I was working my way through, the median family \nrequired only something on the order of less than 3 to 4 percent of its \nincome to send someone to college. Now we are talking about almost 9 to \n10 percent. If they are going to go to a private institution, it can be \nwell over 50 percent.\n\n  So you cannot work your way through college any more in 4 years on a \nminimum-wage job. You cannot do it.\n  So an awful lot of students, including even many of our children--and \nwe are in relative terms more affluent than the average American--have \nloans. My colleague, the former professor, knows more about this than I \ndo. I heard him quote the statistic that we have flipped. It used to be \nthat most of the money people got to go to college were grants, and a \nminority were loans. Now they are almost all loans and a minority are \ngrants.\n  I realize, even if this resolution passes, it is not going to change \nthe law. But maybe it will put us on record of doing something that is \nlong overdue, just as we give businesses a tax break for investing in \nnew machinery and new plant and equipment because it generates economic \ngrowth--I ask unanimous consent to proceed for 2 more minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BIDEN. It is sound policy to say to a business that, ``If you \ninvest in this new piece of machinery, it will increase productivity, \nyou will end up hiring more people, and it will generate income.'' That \nis going to increase the economic growth of the Nation. It makes sense \nto do that. Well, there is nothing that increases the economic growth \nof this Nation more than investing in the higher education of our \nchildren.\n  It is getting increasingly difficult for young men and women like me \nwho come from a middle-income household--I guess technically lower \nmiddle-income, but a middle-income household--to be able to go off to \ncollege.\n  It is just getting very, very, very hard. If my father were making \nthe money he made then now, he would be making about $34,000 a year, if \nI am not mistaken. He had four children he sent to college. How do you \nsend four children to the State university--the State university--on \n$34,000 a year? My father, it seems to me, and my mother and their \ncounterparts today--my dad is now 80--think that college education is \nthe single most important legacy, other than our religion, other than \nour Catholicism, in my case. The single most important thing my parents \nwanted to leave with me was to have a college education, which they did \nnot have.\n  It is getting awfully hard for people to do it. I think this is a \nsound investment. I think it is just. I know it is almost oratory if it \nis only a resolution, but it increases the prospects that we will find \nthe wherewithal to go on record and actually change the law.\n  So I thank my colleagues for their indulgence. I thank my friend from \nMinnesota for his leadership. I realize he says this is bipartisan. I \nheard this idea generated from my Republican colleagues as well as my \nDemocratic colleagues. I thank the Chair. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Madam President, in just 10 seconds, I want to say I \nwas really remiss in the beginning when I laid down the amendment in \nnot saying that it was on behalf of myself and Senator Biden. I am \nreally proud to have him out here on the floor speaking about this.\n  I was just going to say to my colleague from Delaware that if you \nthink about the economics of this, this becomes the sort of central \nmiddle-class issue, working-family issue, because really what happens \nis, those students who can get the grant assistance tend to be the \nlower income students, and then if you are in the very high-income end, \nyou can pay your way. But it is those families in between that are \nreally feeling the squeeze. He is so right on the mark.\n\n  The only other point I will make, Madam President, which is why I \nhope this is adopted as a statement before the Senate, I spent a great \ndeal of time on campus. It takes a student on the average of 6 years--\nit is getting up near 7 years--and that is because they are working two \nand three minimum-wage jobs. Most students are working 30, 45 hours a \nweek while they are going to school.\n  The other thing to add to the equation, which is very different than \nwhen we went to school, because we are similar in age, is that the \nstudents now are no longer 18 and 19 and living in the dorm. I think \nthe majority of students now, if not the majority just about close to \nthe majority of students are 30, 40, 45, 50, going back to school, many \nof them women, many of them with children. As a matter of fact, this is \none of the ways in which many families get back on their feet. So those \nstudents who really have children feel this economic squeeze as well.\n  I think this is just a critical vote, and I hope we will have a \nstrong vote for it.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum and ask that \nthe time be charged equally to both sides.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The clerk \nwill call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. EXON. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. EXON. Madam President, I am about to yield whatever time he may \nneed from our side to the minority leader. But before I do that, I want \nto renew the clarion call once again. We have, according to our \nrecords--this list in my hand which I will not bother to count--lots of \namendments that have been offered, have been debated, that we are going \nto start voting on some time.\n  But in addition to that, we have about 28 to 30 amendments that \nSenators have indicated to the managers are going to be offered. This \nwould be a very good time to offer them because, if we do not see some \nmovement on some of these things, we may run completely out of time. \nThen Senators are going to come here and say, ``Why\n\n[[Page S5415]]\n\ndidn't you protect me in offering an amendment?''\n  I am protecting them now. The chairman of the committee is protecting \nthose on his side. But we are running out of patience on protection.\n  So I plead once again that the Senators who have indicated to the \nmanagers of the bill that they are going to offer amendments, please \ncome over and do so. If you are not going to offer the amendment, \nplease call the cloakroom, the respective cloakroom, whether Democrat \nor Republican, and indicate that the amendment is not going to be \noffered. That will give us a chance to better manage and move the \nproposition along.\n  I ask unanimous consent to set the pending amendment aside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. EXON. With that, I yield whatever time he may need off our time \nto the minority leader.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Inhofe). The distinguished minority \nleader.\n\n\n                             Point of Order\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, let me first associate myself with the \nremarks of the distinguished ranking member. We are down, now, to the \nfinal couple of hours. I really hope we will not lose the opportunity \nto have a good debate on whatever issues are left outstanding. I think \nthere has been a real, good-faith effort over the last 2\\1/2\\ days to \nreach this point. We have had a good debate. I hope we can finish it \noff now. There are virtually no Members on the floor prepared to offer \namendments. We ought to correct that. We will give people an \nopportunity in the next 10 minutes to come to the floor and offer \nadditional amendments.\n  In the meantime, I want to call attention to a concern I have raised \na number of times already relating to the circumstances in which we \nfind ourselves on this particular resolution. I have viewed the \nprocedures employed by the majority all through the 104th Congress with \nincreasing concern. Our side, the Democratic caucus, has been \nsystematically deprived of the opportunity to offer legitimate \namendments. It has been an recurring practice on the Senate floor over \nthe last several months for the majority to offer a bill, to fill the \nso-called parliamentary tree, preclude Democrats from offering \namendments, and then file cloture so we are left with no other recourse \nbut to vote against cloture and to continue to bottle up the \nlegislation. It's either that or accept entire bills as forced upon us \nby the majority without seeking to exercise our fundamental rights as \nSenators to debate and amend. Given those terms, we've had no choice \nbut to vote against cloture. We have voiced our concern over and over, \nand will continue to do so, about this fundamental abuse of Senate \nrules. Democrats never employed such extreme tactics when we were in \nthe majority. I hope we will not get in the habit of doing so in the \nfuture. I think it is wrong. I think it undermines the good-faith \neffort Republicans and Democrats need to demonstrate in moving \nlegislation through this body.\n  Certainly, it's legitimate to oppose legislation. We can have \nextended debate. But to preclude the minority from offering even a \nsingle amendment is unprecedented, and, again, simply wrong.\n  We are moving now from that practice to another one that, in my view, \nis even more threatening to the Senate as an institution. This \nresolution will do something that we have not done now in more than 20 \nyears. In fact, I would say in all of the modern day period of the \nbudget process, we have never done this. Only once, right as we were \nbeginning to employ the reconciliation process and before that process \nwas well understood, did we ever do what the Republicans are attempting \nto do in this budget resolution.\n  In fact, I think it's arguable that the one precedent adduced for the \npractice I'm about to describe is not a precedent at all--but rather a \nrudimentary misuse of the term ``reconciliation'' that should be \ndismissed as an example of anything.\n  This is the first budget resolution that will instruct a committee to \nproduce a reconciliation measure that actually increases the deficit. \nThe 1974 precedent we will hear about was based on no reconciliation \ninstruction. And this year's unprecedented abuse therefore calls into \nquestion what reconciliation is about in the first place.\n  We all know what reconciliation was designed to be and what it has \nbeen. We all know that we pass budget resolutions with reconciliation \ninstructions in order to ensure that the authorizing committees hit \ndeficit reduction targets. Some way of enforcing deficit reduction on \ncommittees is the sole reason for being of the highly privileged \nvehicle we call reconciliation. We deprive Senators of their normal \nrights to debate and amend only because we seek to ensure that the \ncommittees follow through in the crucial business of exercising fiscal \nresponsibility.\n  That is the reconciliation process. Its objective is to continue to \nreduce the deficit, and it does so by compelling committees to live up \nto the expectations of the budget resolution. But what are we doing \nthis year? As I say, except for the rare and understandable \ncircumstances in 1974, this body is doing something we have never done \nbefore. We will be passing a reconciliation bill in three parts, one \npart of which will actually increase the deficit dramatically--\ndramatically.\n  I must tell you, what goes around comes around. I cannot see any \nreason why Democrats--once back in the majority--cannot conveniently \nbegin to use reconciliation packages for all kinds of legislative \nagendas. I do not see why we may not ultimately authorize through a \nbudget resolution a reconciliation package for each month. Let us just \nput all the legislation we want to do in each reconciliation package. \nWe will then preclude the possibility of any more extended debates, \npreclude the possibility of an open and free discussion, preclude the \npossibility of amendments in some cases. We will change the very \ncharacter of this institution in a very permanent way.\n  I am not sure that is what the majority wants. In fact, I'm confident \nmost on the other side of the aisle do not want that. I know if they \nwere in the minority--they would certainly not want it. And I know that \nmost of my friends on the other side do not expect to be in the \nmajority forever.\n  I would say that all of us, regardless of whether we are in the \nmajority or minority, want to protect the institution of the Senate and \nits rules. That ought to be one of our foremost goals. If we are going \nto bend and change the rules so dramatically to serve the political \nneeds of the moment, we are not living up to our responsibilities to \nthe institution of the Senate. We are not living up to what our \npredecessors understood to be the practice of this body. And we are not \nliving up to the obligation we have to our constituents to preserve the \nlegislative freedoms and protections embodied in the Senate's rules and \ntraditions.\n  So, it is with great concern that I call attention to what I consider \nto be a very, very dangerous set of legislative circumstances mandated \nby this budget resolution. I think it is a fundamental abuse of the \nbudget process. It is such an abuse that it calls into question whether \nthe document before us actually constitutes a budget resolution.\n  I would argue it does not. I argue that, because it creates a budget \nreconciliation bill devoted solely to worsening the deficit, it should \nno longer deserve the limitations on debate of a budget resolution. \nTherefore, I raise a point of order that, for these reasons, the \npending resolution is not a budget resolution.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator wish to be heard on the point \nof order before the Chair rules?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I think in deference to the minority \nleader I should be heard. I obviously did not bring this resolution to \nthe floor without consulting with the Parliamentarian. So I think I \nknow the answer to the Senator's question. But I do not think that we \nshould let the Chair rule and then only have time if the Senator \nappeals to discuss our side, although if the Senator appeals we will \nalso take some additional time.\n  Mr. President, could I yield myself 15 minutes off the resolution or \ndo I have some additional time because of the nature of the situation?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time is controlled by the wording of the \nBudget Act, and the Senator has 1 hour and 56 minutes.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I yield myself up to 15 minutes. I hope I will not use \nthat much.\n\n[[Page S5416]]\n\n  Might I say to the distinguished minority leader that I do not think \nthere are very many Senators--maybe I would yield to Senator Byrd--who \nhave more concern about protecting and preserving this institution than \nthe Senator from New Mexico. I truly think the Senate is a very special \nplace, and it has a lot of attributes that make it that way. I \npersonally will resist any efforts, now or in the future, to move this \nbody away from its historic tradition of being very free and open on \ndebate and having one very big characteristic, and that is that most \nthings can be filibustered--open debate.\n  However, I submit that there is a Budget Act that was adopted almost \nunanimously by the Senate that for very special events changed both of \nthose rules. The rule that an amendment, that a bill or measure can be \nfreely amended was altered; for as long as we have that Budget Act in \nplace, that will not be the rule on a reconciliation bill.\n  Second, the very nature of the budget resolution denies filibuster. \nIn the very statute that creates it, that other characteristic about \nthe Senate--open debate for as long as you want--is negated.\n  That is not a unilateral decision by this Senator or Senator Exon or \nthe minority leader. That decision was made when the Budget Act was \npassed, for there are time restraints on every aspect of a budget \nincluding 50 on the resolution, 20 when it comes back from conference. \nReconciliation bills have a time limit on them.\n  Additionally there is a very strict definition of germaneness with \nreference to offering amendments to reconciliation bills.\n  Now, before I explain that we are not breaking precedent and cite for \nthe Senate a number of occasions when we have heretofore done exactly \nwhat the Senator is complaining about, before we do that I would \nsuggest that the concern that whether we have one reconciliation bill, \ntwo or three, that we are going to be able to do all the legislation of \nthe Senate in derogation of the quality of the Senate with reference to \nopen debate and the freedom of amendment, standing in the way of that \nis the Byrd rule.\n  We do not change the Byrd rule in this budget resolution. There \nagain, it establishes that if you intended to use a reconciliation \ninstruction in that bill to just change the substantive law because you \nhad not been able to pass it somewhere else, it will get knocked out by \nthe Byrd rule.\n  So the first thing I was worried about is if we do this in this \nsequence--and I will explain to the Senate why we did it this way--do \nwe in any way open in any additional way these reconciliation bills to \nbe used by Senators to amendment processes, to amend laws that are \nunrelated and in no way, in no way germane to reducing the deficit. The \nanswer I got unequivocally is that we had not changed that. So that is \npoint No. 1.\n  Second, there is nothing in the Budget Act--section 310 and any other \nsections--that precludes us doing more than one reconciliation bill. \nSection 310(a) provides that a budget resolution may specify the total \namount by which, among other things, revenues are to be changed. \nSection 310 dictates neither the magnitude nor the direction of the \nchange. Reconciliation is a neutral budgetary tool. It is not required \nto produce deficit reduction.\n  As a matter of fact, Mr. President, on that point alone, must each \npart of a reconciliation bill or each of the three reduce the deficit, \nI would call to the Senate's attention that in 1975 a reconciliation \ninstruction and a bill passed here under the leadership of the Senator \nfrom Louisiana, Russell Long, chairman of the Finance Committee--in \n1975. It actually was used to reduce taxes, thus increasing the \ndeficit--for that very purpose. Clearly, clearly, I find nothing in \nthis law that says each reconciliation bill must reduce the deficit.\n  Now, let me tell you that the budget resolution for 1994, your budget \nresolution for the year 1994 had two reconciliation instructions. One \nwas for everything that you do normally, and the other was to change \nthe debt limit of the United States by a reconciliation bill--two \ndifferent instructions, two different bills. Now, if you can do two \nbecause it fits the necessities that one side of the aisle has, this \nshould not mean that you cannot do three if it fits the other side.\n  Now, in our budget resolution, we did this in three steps. This \nprocess would provide more extensive consideration on the Senate floor \nof our legislative proposals for balancing the budget in 2002, for if \non each of the three components there are 20 hours of debate, it seems \nto this Senator that for those who want more time to debate, and \ncertainly for those who would say this process we have adopted is \nclosing debate, the exact opposite is true. There is more time for \ndebate on each of them because rather than 20 hours for a big, giant \nbill, there will be three times that for each will be subject to that \nmany hours of debate.\n  By separating these proposals to balance the budget into what we \nmight consider manageable issues, we permit Senators to address their \nconcerns contained in each of the bills. Rather than as many Senators \ncomplain about the very large bill that has taxes in it, has all kinds \nof entitlements from all different sides in an all-or-nothing \nproposition, we permit them to have part of it, not all of it, in one, \npart in another, and then, of course, taxes or tax reductions at the \nend.\n  The first bill reconciles savings equivalent to the assumptions \ncontained in a resolution for welfare reform and Medicaid, and the \ncommittees must report on that.\n  If the first bill is enacted, then the second bill would reconcile \nall committees regarding direct savings. The committees would report, \nby July 12, two totally distinct events with total debate on each of \nthem under the Budget Act. If both the first and the second bills are \nenacted--if they are--then a final bill reconciles the Finance \nCommittee regarding revenue reductions.\n  I will read some history of past comments on reconciliation. Mr. \nPresident, a member of the President's own administration has in the \npast advocated consideration of separate packages. In 1982, during the \ndebate on the rule to take up one of four reconciliation bills in the \nHouse of Representatives that year, then-Member of Congress Leon \nPanetta said, regarding the vote on the rule:\n\n       This is, I think, one of the most important votes they will \n     cast this session. It will set the stage for whether we can \n     deal with reconciliation on an orderly basis, allowing \n     packages, allowing committees to come to the floor, and \n     allowing Members to vote up or down on those issues, or \n     whether we are going to capitulate to some kind of chaos, the \n     same kind of irresponsibility that we were put through last \n     year when we had an up-or-down vote on a last-minute 800-page \n     amendment.\n\n  All circumstances are not alike. One might argue that Leon Panetta \nwas arguing about a completely different situation. But, Mr. President, \nI think what he said is right. It does not mean you have to have more \nthan one reconciliation bill, one movement or effort, and bringing the \nlaws together and changing them so as to achieve the goal of the budget \nresolution. That is what a bill is that is called reconciliation.\n  So, Mr. President, I am firmly convinced that we are doing the right \nthing. I believe when this budget resolution is passed, very shortly \nthereafter there will be a very healthy debate on a portion of the \nreconciliation package that we passed heretofore.\n  I call to the Senate's attention that in House Concurrent Resolution \n64, fiscal year 1994, the House Agricultural Committee was reconciled \nfor outlay increases for fiscal years 1994 through 1998. That was an \nincreased reconciliation for food stamps.\n  In addition, in our budget resolution last year, House Concurrent \nResolution 67, the Finance Committee was reconciled for a revenue \nreduction. In 1975, I repeat, during the first use of reconciliation \npursuant to what was then H. Con. Res. 466, both the Ways and Means \nCommittee and the Finance Committee were reconciled for revenue \nreductions.\n  Mr. President, it may be that we will, as the majority, be in the \nsame position someday, in the minority, with this Budget Act still \nintact and the new majority may indeed want to offer one resolution \nwith everything in it. We are not going to be able, based on today, to \nsay they cannot do that. If they choose to go back to one huge \nreconciliation bill, all or nothing, they can. If they choose, Mr. \nPresident and fellow Senators, to go to two, the ruling of the Chair \ntoday will probably\n\n[[Page S5417]]\n\nsay that there will be two. If they choose to do three, and the last \none is a tax reduction package, then I assume we will be in a position \nwhere we can make some noise about it on the floor, but we are not \ngoing to get a parliamentary ruling that it is improper.\n  Mr. President, I repeat, I believe the complexity of welfare reform \nand Medicaid are sufficient to be in one bill. I believe the complexity \nand the policy changes for those two proposals are sufficient to be in \none bill.\n  I submit that all the other entitlement programs are sufficient to be \nin another bill. I submit that the Republicans are committed, the \nPresident is committed, and indeed the bipartisan package is committed \nto some tax reductions. There is argument about which ones. But I \nsubmit that can be done under precedent as far back as 1975, to have a \ntax reduction reconciliation bill.\n  So, Mr. President, I am sorry I talked so long, but I worked on this \nfor a long time. As a matter of fact, I take a bit of pride in it. I \nthought this was a far better way to handle the business of a major \nchange in the law of our land and tax cuts than we tried last year.\n\n  I truly think it is fair to the Senate and it is fair to the public \nfor they will better understand what we are doing. Since that is the \ncase, I recommended it to both the House and the Senate. That is why we \nare here today. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. A point of order is debated under the \ndiscretion of the Chair.\n  Would the Senator from South Dakota desire a few minutes?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, as I understand the parliamentary \nsituation, the Chair could rule and then the debate is anticipated to \nbe at least 1 hour on the appeal of the ruling of the Chair; is that \ncorrect?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I prefer to have the ruling of the Chair. I anticipate \nthe ruling, and then I will appeal the ruling.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All right. The Chair will rule that the \nresolution is appropriate and the point of order is not sustained.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I now appeal the ruling of the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There will be 1 hour equally divided between \nthe Senator from New Mexico and the Senator from South Dakota.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I have no desire to use that kind of \ntime. I know there are a number of Senators who wish to offer \namendments. But in the interest of parliamentary procedure, let me take \na little bit of time, and then we will present a series of \nparliamentary inquiries that may help set the record in this instance.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I ask the Senator, could I ask a question?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I would be happy to let the Senator.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Does the Senator intend to vote on this separately \ntoday or within the series of votes on the amendments?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I think we can do it in the series of votes just to \nexpedite things.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, the Senator from New Mexico, the \ndistinguished chairman of the Budget Committee, notes that we have seen \nan occasion such as this arise. I alluded to that circumstance in 1974. \nThat was 20 years ago. In the world of the Budget Act, that 20-year \nperiod is a lifetime. Congress, and in particular the Senate, have \ndramatically changed the budget process since then.\n  In the 1980's, the Senate adopted, as the Senator from New Mexico \nnoted, the Byrd rule to restrain and limit reconciliation. Since the \nearly 1980's, a long history of using the reconciliation process to \nreduce the deficit has evolved.\n  The chairman of the Budget Committee noted that the Byrd rule \nrequires that there be a sufficient offset or deficit-reduction--and no \nworsening of the deficit in the outyears--to a reconciliation package \nfor it to be in order. But his reconciliation instructions in this \nresolution trigger a tax provision that does absolutely no deficit \nreduction, and certainly worsens the deficit beyond the window of the \nresolution itself.\n  Mr. President, that being the case, only two outcomes are possible. \nFirst, there would be no tax reduction after the 6th year; that is, \nthat tax reduction anticipated in this reconciliation package would no \nlonger apply in year 7 because, if it did, there would be a deficit \ncreated, and then obviously the Byrd rule would apply. Or, second, \nthere is some sort of offset which is not delineated here. If that is \nthe case, I'd like to hear what that undisclosed offset is.\n  This difficulty is the inevitable result of using reconciliation \nimproperly for deficit creation rather than deficit reduction. The fact \nthat the Byrd rule creates clear problems for this approach only \nconfirms that this resolution's reconciliation instruction is totally \ninappropriate.\n  The 1970's precedent did not involve a budget process resolution \ninstructing the committee to produce a reconciliation bill that worsens \nthe deficit. Senator Long, who was chairman of the Finance Committee at \nthe time, simply came down to the floor and claimed that the tax cut \nbill then under consideration was a reconciliation bill. Again, there \nhad been no instruction to the Finance Committee. There was no previous \nunderstanding that the Senate was operating under reconciliation \nprocedures.\n  It is true that at that point everybody stood and saluted. But that \ndoes not change the fact that the chairman's tax cut bill should not \nhave been considered a reconciliation bill in 1974, as the budget \nresolution had not directed the creation of a reconciliation bill \nitself.\n  So, in sum, the 1974 precedent was wrongly decided. I hope that we \nwill not build upon that error now in 1996. The Byrd rule and other \nsubsequent amendments to the Budget Act clearly imply the deficit \nreducing nature of the reconciliation process.\n  I will quote the language of 313-B, section 1, subsection (b):\n\n       Any provision producing an increase in outlays or decrease \n     in revenues shall be considered extraneous if the net effect \n     of provisions reported by the committee reporting the title \n     containing the provision is that the committee fails to \n     achieve its reconciliation instruction.\n\n  This is a portion of the Byrd rule, and in expressly singling out \nincreased spending and tax cuts as potentially inappropriate in a \ncommittee's work product, the language clearly implies that the true \nreconciliation effort should be to reduce spending or increase taxes. \nIn other words, the proper reconciliation function is deficit \nreduction.\n  Mr. President, the bottom line here is that if a reconciliation bill \nproduces only an increase in outlays or a decrease in revenues it is \nsubject to the Byrd rule and therefore extraneous. Given those \nconditions, the third portion of this resolution's reconciliation \ngrouping certainly violates the Byrd rule on the face of it.\n  Mr. President, I know the Senator from New Mexico indicated it was \nfor managerial facilitation that he has presented this bifurcated \napproach to the reconciliation package. I must say, I think \n``managerial'' can explain just about anything. Obviously, managers \nwant all kinds of devices to move their agenda along.\n  In any case, managerial comfort is no justification for a practice \nthat clearly violates many decades of Senate procedure. And as I've \nsaid, this practice is unprecedented. It is dangerous. It is \nextraordinarily harmful to the institution itself.\n  Mr. President, I make a parliamentary inquiry.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator will state the parliamentary \ninquiry.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. This resolution directs the creation of three \nreconciliation bills, as I noted. It provides that the third \nreconciliation bill shall occur only if the first two have been \nenacted.\n  Is it the opinion of the Chair that this resolution would continue to \nbe a budget resolution if it directed the creation of that third \nreconciliation bill--the one that solely worsens the deficit--even \nunder circumstances when the Congress had failed to enact the prior two \nreconciliation bills?\n  I would be happy to repeat the inquiry if that needs to be done.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair would respond that it appears to be \na hypothetical question, and I am not sure it would help to repeat it, \nbut you might try.\n\n[[Page S5418]]\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Let me rephrase it, because I think it is a very \nimportant question and I do not think it is hypothetical at all. In \nfact, it deals directly with the circumstances at hand.\n  Is it the opinion of the Chair that this resolution would continue to \nbe a budget resolution if it directed the creation of only that third \nreconciliation bill--the one that solely worsens the deficit--even \nunder circumstances when the Congress had failed to enact the prior two \nreconciliation bills?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If the Senator's question is, can the budget \nresolution direct the creation of a reconciliation bill which lowers \nrevenues, the answer is yes.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. A second parliamentary inquiry. Is it the opinion of the \nChair that this resolution would continue to be a budget resolution if \nit directed the creation of only that third reconciliation bill--the \none that solely worsens the deficit--and did not direct the enactment \nof the two prior reconciliation bills?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The answer is yes.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, third inquiry. The pending resolution \ninstructs the Finance and Ways and Means Committees to produce a bill \nthat cuts taxes. There are no other instructions to those committees \nwith regard to that reconciliation bill. Is it the opinion of the Chair \nthat it would be in order for a budget resolution to instruct the \ncreation of a reconciliation bill that increased outlays and gave no \nother instructions to those committees with regard to that \nreconciliation bill?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Yes.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, the Byrd rule forbids legislation that \nwill increase the deficit in years beyond those covered in the budget \nresolution. If this third reconciliation bill does not find a way to \nend or offset its tax cuts in the years beyond 2002, would the bill \nviolate the Byrd rule?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Yes, it would.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Is it not true, unless the budget resolution assumes \nthat the tax cuts will sunset in 2002, or be offset by tax increases \nthereafter, the resolution calls for a reconciliation bill that would \nviolate the Byrd rule?\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The resolution cannot make assumptions beyond \nthe years which are instructed.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. That is not the question, Mr. President.\n  What I am asking is that under the Byrd rule there must be a \ndetermination that the deficit is not increased by actions taken in the \nreconciliation instructions in the outyears, in the years beyond the \nwindow.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Byrd rule does not apply to reconciliation \ninstructions. It applies to a reconciliation bill.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. That is my point, Mr. President. This resolution assumes \nthat a reconciliation bill will be triggered that will violate the Byrd \nrule unless it is terminated at the end of 2002 or else subsequently \noffset.\n  The assumption of the resolution is that tax cuts will sunset in the \nyear 2002 or be offset by tax increases thereafter in order for it not \nto be in violation of the Byrd rule, is that not correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The budget resolution makes no assumptions.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, let me ask you this: Would the \nreconciliation bill be in order if the budget resolution did not \naddress the issue of deficit reduction beyond that 6-year timeframe?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. I read to you under extraneous provisions (e):\n\n       A provision shall be considered to be extraneous if it \n     increases or would increase net outlays or if it decreases or \n     would decrease revenues during a fiscal year after the fiscal \n     years covered by such a reconciliation bill or reconciliation \n     resolution.\n\n  This only applies to reconciliation bills.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Let me then phrase my question another way, because I \nthink we can now clarify this.\n  The reconciliation bill triggered by this resolution would not be in \norder, in other words, if it failed either to offset the tax cuts or to \nsunset them after fiscal year 2002, is that not correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, let me just note parenthetically, if that \nis correct, that the majority party is the same party that has \ncriticized the President's budget because the President sunsets his tax \ncuts. But now the majority comes before us with a reconciliation \ninstruction that requires either that their tax cuts be abruptly \nsunsetted in the year 2002 or that taxes be increased dramatically \nafter that point to pay for the continuing tax cuts.\n  Is it the opinion of the Chair that it is in order for a budget \nresolution to call for the creation of 10 different reconciliation \nbills in one fiscal year?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is no number limiting the number of \nreconciliation bills.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, this is, in my view, a ludicrous abuse of \npower. If this ruling is upheld we will be giving more and more power \nto the Budget Committee, power cloaked in the fast-track protection of \nthe budget process itself. We will be granting immense power to the \nmajority. If this precedent is pushed to its logical conclusion, I \nsuspect there will come a day when all legislation will be done through \nreconciliation.\n  A decade ago the Senate wisely amended the reconciliation process by \nadding the Byrd rule to ensure that reconciliation bills would be \nnarrowly drawn and limited to their deficit reduction purpose.\n  This ruling poses a serious threat to the Budget Committee as we will \nbecome more and more like the House Rules Committee and the Senate more \nand more like the House of Representatives.\n  For those of us who want deficit reduction, the majority seeks a very \ndangerous precedent today. For those of you who believe in the history \nof the Senate and unlimited debate and the right of Senators to offer \namendments, the majority seeks to set very dangerous precedents today.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote to overturn the ruling of the Chair. If \nwe do not, the Senate will surely became a different place and a much \ndiminished institution.\n  Mr. President, I note the distinguished Senator from South Carolina, \nthe former chairman of the Budget Committee, seeks recognition to \naddress this issue. And I am sure my colleague, the current ranking \nmember of Budget committee, does so as well.\n  I yield the floor for that purpose.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I do not intend to stay and debate the \nissue very long. Perhaps Senator Gorton can stay in my stead.\n  But let me just suggest that in the view of this Senator the Budget \nAct offers a great deal of latitude to the U.S. Senate and to the \nBudget Committee. It can be controlled by the U.S. Senate, if the U.S. \nSenate chooses to do so. As a matter of fact, even on the Senator's \npoint of order, if the Senate chooses to sustain his appeal, or to \ngrant his appeal, the Senate will have decided that it does not in this \nreconciliation bill intend us to have three reconciliation bills. I \nbelieve that is a matter for the Senate.\n  But to argue that in this instance when you are contemplating a very \nlarge reconciliation bill with all kinds of things in it, one shot, one \ndebate, one vote and that we cannot find a judicious way to do better \nthan that by having more than one reconciliation bill, more than one \nopportunity to vote on this, seems to me to fly in the face of \npermitting the Senate to do its business in the best way that it can \nunder very strict rules of the Budget Committee. And I, frankly, \nbelieve that this is a better way to handle a huge and varied number of \nbills--to have more than one debate. And, frankly, we are committed to \na balanced budget and to the balanced budget continuing on beyond the \n2002. We do not intend to have tax cuts to take us out of balance in 8 \nyears. That would be matched up against entitlement savings that go on. \nIt will be matched up against caps on discretionary programs that go \non.\n  So the issue of us being forced to sunset, and in some way that is \nunder the technical ruling today, in some way that puts us in the same \nboat with the President who has submitted a budget that is not in \nbalance under the same rules that the Senate applies, and then to say \nwe put it in balance by triggering and closing off the tax cuts and to\n\n[[Page S5419]]\n\nsay they are the same, to me just flies absolutely in the face of every \nkind of factual assessment you want to make about the two budgets.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The minority leader.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I appeal the ruling of the Chair, and ask \nfor the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has already appealed. There is 1 \nhour to be equally divided.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Is it not appropriate to ask for the yeas and nays at \nthis time?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. It is appropriate to ask for them.\n  Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, I am about to yield whatever is yielded from \nour time to my distinguished friend from South Carolina.\n  I think this debate has been absolutely fascinating because from the \nvery beginning of the budget debate this year I was struck by what I \nhad never seen before; and, that is three reconciliation bills. I \nsimply say that the excellent debate that has taken place highlights \nthe fact, and proves beyond any doubt what I have always suspected--\nthat the majority in this case on the Budget Committee are trying to \nuse this new reconciliation process to protect a tax cut from full \ndebate and amendment, something they obviously could not get that done \nunder the usual rules of the Senate. The budget reconciliation keeps \nthose of us who are opposed to that kind of a proposition from using \nthe traditional filibuster techniques. We should have a debate. We \nshould have all of the rules in place when we talk about cutting or \nraising taxes.\n  I happen to feel that the move by the majority in this instance is an \nundisputed abuse of power and if it is allowed to occur, will it cause \nthem great heartbreak in the future.\n  Certainly the Senator from South Carolina I believe has been on the \nBudget Committee since its inception, and I think there are few, if any \nin the body, who have a better understanding of what the intent of that \nlegislation is.\n  I am pleased to yield to him whatever time he needs.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I thank my distinguished friend, the Senator from \nNebraska.\n  Mr. President, I come to the floor of the Senate and I cannot keep up \nwith everything going on. I hear different things--such as a \n``Reconciliation Act of 1975''--which are totally false.\n  I also heard someone refer to Senator Long as having been chairman of \nthe Budget Committee--also totally false.\n  When I hear these things I remember very, very clearly the history of \nreconciliation. I can tell you in the late 1970's we used to kid about \nreconciliation over on the House side; they said they could not even \npronounce it. And if you go to the Record you will find that back in \n1975, the Revenue Adjustment Act to which they are now referring was \nnot a Reconciliation Act.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (H.R. 5559) to make changes in certain income tax \n     provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954, and for \n     other purposes.\n\n  That was not reconciliation. I know Senator Long could use language \nloosely from time to time. But that was not a reconciliation bill. We \ndid not start reconciliation until December 1980. I was chairman of the \nBudget Committee, and the distinguished Senator from New Mexico was on \nthe Budget Committee at that time. And I am sure the Congressional \nRecord will reflect the fact that the first reconciliation bill in the \nhistory of the Government of the United States of America was in \nDecember 1980, and has nothing to do with the precedent noted by the \nParliamentarian in 1975. Back then we only had 1-year budgets.\n  Now let me speak to the history of reconciliation. We started out \ndiscussing the matter with our colleagues on the House side. The \ndistinguished Member from the State of Washington, Congressman Adams \nwas the chairman at that time. And we talked back and forth. But after \nPresident Carter was defeated on a Tuesday in November, I went over \nthat Friday to the White House, after we received new budget numbers \nfrom the Congressional Budget Office. The Congressional Budget Office \nprojection of revenues and outlays showed that the deficit was going up \nto about $43 billion. I said, ``Mr. President, no Democrat is going to \never get elected if we don't cut the deficit. It is going to be the \nlargest deficit in the history of the Government.'' He said, ``What are \nyou going to do?'' I said, ``Well, there is a fancy word, Mr. \nPresident, reconciliation. I think I can get Chairman Giaimo to go \nalong.'' I had talked to Bob ahead of time. I told the president, \n``What it means is cut; to go back and cut those things that were \nalready allocated.'' Now, back then the fiscal year was from July to \nJuly. We were already in December and we needed to try to reduce. That \nis the history of reconciliation--to reduce deficits.\n\n  This idea of coming in here and saying that the word is ``change'', \nand it does not specify up or down is totally out of the ballpark. It \nis in reference to the budget process. If we can find Mr. Giaimo from \nConnecticut we could bring him back here and some of the others--Brock \nAdams; Jimmy Jones who is now the Ambassador down in Mexico, they would \ntell you that reconciliation is a procedure to reduce the deficit.\n  The whole context given here this afternoon is that of minority-\nmajority, majority-minority, and all of that. I understand that. The \ndistinguished minority leader is right on target. But the greatest \nconcern is that we may break all discipline from the majority or the \nminority in the United States Congress itself if we go this route. We \nhave to overrule this nonsense. This ruling of the Chair is totally \nspurious with no basis whatsoever in fact.\n  The truth of the matter is that the bill considered in 1975 was not a \nreconciliation bill, it was a tax revenue act. If you look at the bill \nyou'll see that it was not reconciliation. And while we are clearing \nthings up, someone just a little while ago said Senator Long was \nchairman of the Budget Committee. Not only was he not chairman, he \nnever served on the Budget Committee. He served as the distinguished \nchairman of Finance. We had our differences with Finance all along, the \ndifference between Senator Muskie and Senator Long. I was there when \nthose particular debates were going on.\n  I would plead to my colleagues very genuinely, to not violate the \nByrd rule, which was to keep us sort of in harness and not just willy-\nnilly put anything on a reconciliation bill.\n  Let us not get around the debate with spurious arguments or about \nSenator Long as chairman of the Budget Committee that he never served \non, or reconciliation that never occurred in 1975.\n  Now, Mr. President, these are the hard facts. If someone would get \nout the Congressional Record and look back, they will see that the \nfirst reconciliation bill was passed by the Congress in 1980. I have \ngot the picture. I have got the frame. I am sure Giaimo has the similar \nframe. The first reconciliation act in the history of this U.S. \nGovernment was in December, 1980. It was signed by President Carter, \nand was 5 years subsequent to the authority they are using now to get \naround what is going on.\n  The problem here is the Presidential politics. It has gotten to be a \ncancer on this entire body. The plan is: we will make them vote on \nwelfare; then we will make them vote on these other things; and then, \nfinally in September, says that resolution, just before the election, \nwe will bring up tax cuts, because the polls say everybody is against \ntaxes. So we will just put them to the task.\n  What we have now is Presidential politics, and they ought to be \nashamed of themselves. Their authority is absolutely fallacious.\n  I happened to be chairman of the Budget Committee at the time, and I \ntold the President: if you can get Herke Harris and Jim McIntyre to \nleave us alone * * * because they were over on the Hill that fall \ntrying to reelect President Carter, putting up money hither and \nthither. And I even went at that time to our liberal spending friends. \nI went to Senator Warren\n\n[[Page S5420]]\n\nMagnuson of Washington, Senator Frank Church of Idaho, Senator George \nMcGovern of South Dakota, Senator John Culver of Iowa, Senator Birch \nBayh of Indiana, Senator Gaylord Nelson of Wisconsin, who used to sit \nright here, and I said: You have got to give us one vote. We have got \nto cut this thing back; otherwise, we are going to leave the biggest \ndeficit in the history of the Government.\n  The whole idea of the reconciliation--and I am giving you firsthand \nhistory; it is honest as the day is long--was to, by gosh, cut back on \nthe deficit. It was not this nebulous argument that as long as it is a \nchange then we can make it go up. I never heard of such a thing. We \nwould have been run out of the Senate in those days. We had some \ndiscipline, some understanding of responsibility, some action of \nresponsibility. It is totally irresponsible to come now and start \nruling that you can put up a reconciliation bill since it is a change. \nEvery bill is a change. So any bill can be called reconciliation. You \ncan go up and you can go down and you can limit the debate. You can, as \nthey call it, fill up the tree, so there are no amendments and there is \na time limit and the majority retires from the floor and goes out to \nwatch TV or something because they have the votes locked and fixed. It \nis really a shame. It is an embarrassment to this particular Senator \nwho served as the chairman of the Budget Committee, and I can tell you \nthe whole precedent given by the Parliamentarian is totally out of the \nwhole cloth.\n  Mr. DORGAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I wonder if the Senator from Nebraska would yield me just \n2 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator yield to the Senator from \nNorth Dakota?\n  Mr. EXON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, I have been fascinated in listening to the \nremarks, that are so much on point, by the Senator from South Carolina. \nI was there in 1980. I remember being called down to the White House on \nan emergency basis with the Senator as chairman of the committee. \nChairman Giaimo was there, and I listened with keen interest to the \nkeen recollection of the facts, with the names and the dates and the \nplaces by my talented colleague from South Carolina.\n\n  Mr. President, I am very much afraid that we are proceeding here in a \nfashion that the majority thinks is good politics. It is going to have \ndire, dire consequences in the future if we continue to proceed and \nfail to overrule the Chair. In all reality we know our appeal will fail \nbecause the Republican majority of 53 has the votes to roll us on this \nside at every occasion.\n  I would tell the Senate that other people who have had experience as \nParliamentarians do not agree with the ruling of the Chair in this \ninstance. But we should all realize and recognize--and the people in \nthe gallery or the people watching on television maybe have some kind \nof questions--that the Parliamentarian, of course, is appointed by the \nparty in the majority, and when we were in the majority we had our \nParliamentarian. Now that the Republicans are in the majority, they are \nentitled to and have their Parliamentarian.\n  We like to keep the Parliamentarians as nonpartisan as possible, but \nI must admit that over the years I have been here I have seen our \nParliamentarian rule in our favor, and while I cannot prove it, I \nhappen to feel that today's Parliamentarian rules in favor of the \npeople that appointed him. So the Parliamentarian is not like a Supreme \nCourt Judge that has lifetime tenure which enables him or her to make \ndeterminations based solely upon history and fact. I would be the last, \nMr. President, to indicate that politics could possibly be involved in \nthe matter before us today--but sometimes it just might be.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired. There are 27 \nminutes remaining on the majority time.\n  Mr. EXON. When the Senator from Missouri finishes--I will yield to \nthe Senator from North Dakota. I have been advised that the Senator \nfrom North Dakota has to leave at 4 o'clock--I yield to him off the \nresolution.\n  Mr. BOND. Go ahead.\n  Mr. EXON. How much time does the Senator from North Dakota wish?\n  I yield the Senator whatever time he needs off the resolution.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, let me just take 30 seconds. I do not \nthink the majority party will want to establish this as a precedent. \nThey would be here in full force, very angry with this, were it being \ndone to them, were we to create multiple reconciliation bills in this \nmanner.\n  But the main point I want to make is, we are told that this third \nreconciliation bill would violate the Byrd rule unless the tax \nreductions are sunsetted, or unless some other expenditure reductions \noccur or some other tax increases occur, in order to pay for the tax \ncuts in the out years. When that point was affirmed, that it would \nviolate the Byrd rule unless that occurred, the chairman of the Budget \nCommittee said that there would be caps on entitlements and other \nexpenditure cuts in the out years. They would have to be done in this \nthird reconciliation bill.\n  I ask, does anybody have information about what we are talking about? \nThese would be cuts beyond what comes in the current budget \nrecommendations of the Senate, so what kind of caps on entitlements or \nfuture cuts in the entitlement programs is the majority party proposing \nin order not to violate the Byrd rule? I ask the question only because \nthe chairman of the Budget Committee made this point a few moments ago. \nIf that is the intent, and if the information exists to tell us and the \nAmerican people what that intent is in more specific detail, I think \nnow would be the time for the majority to give us those details.\n  Mr. EXON. Before the Senator from North Dakota leaves, may I ask a \nquestion of the Senator from North Dakota? We heard a great deal and we \nhave had a lot of criticism from that side of the aisle on the \nPresident's budget with the idea that it has a trigger in the last year \nor two that is not factual, not upfront, and not leveling with the \nAmerican people. In view of the fact that that charge had been made, \nwhether it is true or not, and I think it is not, could the same thing \nnot be said with regard to the action taken by the majority in this \ncase by having a trigger that would benefit them? That seems to be all \nright----\n  Mr. DORGAN. In response to the Senator, that is exactly the case that \nexists here. Either these tax reductions in the third reconciliation \nbill will be sunsetted, or there will be additional tax increases \nbeyond the final year, or there will be additional cuts. It sounds like \na trigger to me.\n  I am told now by the chairman of the Budget Committee they are \ntalking about caps on entitlements in addition to what we see in the \nbudget. My question is, what would those be? Will they tell us and the \nAmerican people what they are talking about, so we understand before we \nproceed down this road?\n  Mr. EXON. I thank my friend. We reserve the remainder of our time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4012\n\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I yield myself 10 minutes off of the \nresolution, not on this point in specific.\n  I have a desire to talk about an amendment, No. 4012, the Harkin \namendment, which cuts other committees and adds $2.7 billion to the \nLabor, HHS subcommittee. I say that for the information of any of my \ncolleagues who may wish to join in.\n  Let me just say in respect to the discussions we have had, very \nimportant discussions over the procedure in the Budget Act, I disagree \nwith the ranking member on the other side, who ascribes politics to the \nprocess and to the Parliamentarian. I think it is time we had some good \npolicy, because in the past this body, with the active involvement of \nthe Presidents of the United States, has run up a $5 trillion debt, \nalmost $18,000 for every man, woman, and child in this country.\n\n  We are in the process of threatening the disability of our Government \nbudget and the economy of this country as a whole if we do not pass a \nbudget that responsibly gets us on a path to balance in the near \nfuture. The budget\n\n[[Page S5421]]\n\nresolution before us proposes to do that. It is a difficult budget. It \nis not easy, but I believe it is one that merits support.\n  There was discussion about the budget the President supported. That \nbudget has been voted down. That budget proposed spending and said if \nit did not get to zero deficit in 2002, several automatic actions \nshould be taken. Those automatic actions lead to about a $16 billion \ntax increase and increase in spectrum fees, which would come to a \nmiddle-class tax increase in 2002, plus $67 billion in cuts in domestic \ndiscretionary programs that would be extremely painful and, frankly, \nfrom what we have heard from some of the administration officials, they \nmay even have no intention of pursuing.\n  Let me get back to the budget that is before us and, in particular, \nthe Harkin-Specter amendment. This amendment, No. 4012, proposes to \nincrease by $2.7 billion the amount in the functions for education, \ntraining and social services and for health activities. Everybody likes \nto be for education and for health care. That sounds very appealing. \nBut that takes money out of other budgets that have been strapped--and \nseverely strapped in the past. I note that it takes money out of the \ndefense budget in many areas where there is no fat. It takes money, in \nspecific, out of the budget for the Veterans' Administration and EPA, \nwhere we have suffered great cuts in the past.\n  Last year there was a rescission of $7 billion out of the funding for \nthe VA, HUD, EPA subcommittee. Then, in the appropriations bills, there \nwas about an $8 billion cut in these functions. Here the amendment \nbefore us would take more money from those functions and add it to the \nLabor, HHS subcommittee. Frankly, that budget under this bill before us \nwould go up slightly for education. Certainly, we all like education. \nBut the problem is very serious when you take a look at where this \nmoney would have to come from.\n  The proponents of this amendment say it will come out of \nadministrative costs. This amendment says nothing about administrative \ncosts. It just takes $1.2 billion out of one place, $1.5 billion out of \nanother, $1.4 billion and $1.4 billion. It does not say anything about \nadministrative costs. It does not define any fat.\n  The cuts that were taken in the VA, HUD, EPA subcommittee last year \nwere draconian cuts. We had to look everywhere we could to find ways to \ncut low-priority programs to enable us to fund the major programs \nfunded in EPA and Veterans' Administration. Just last week, this body \nvoted overwhelmingly, 75 to 23, against very severe cuts that the \nPresident had proposed to take out of veterans medical care.\n  In addition, I think every Member of this body will recall that \nduring the debates on the 1996 appropriations bill, the current-year \nspending bills, everybody wanted to spend more on the environment. \nEverybody had something more they wanted to add to environmental \nspending. Let me make it quite clear that if this amendment is adopted, \nthe money is going to come out of the environment and/or Veterans' \nAdministration health care. There is no other pot for it to come out \nof. There is no category of administrative costs and administrative \nwaste that is going to be reduced. This money is going to come out of \nthe environment and/or veterans health care.\n  I know everybody would like to put more money in education. \nCertainly, I would as well. But after the battles that we have had \nhere, to try to get the funds increased to carry out the vital \nenvironmental programs that the EPA is charged with, I would be very \nsurprised if people will vote to cut the environment, and then they \nwill come back to this floor when we are debating the bill itself and \nsay, ``Why can't we put more money in the environment?''\n  Mr. President, a vote for the Harkin amendment is a vote to take \nmoney out of the environment. It is a vote to take money out of VA \nmedical care. These are the critical priorities that would be hit if \nthis measure is to be adopted.\n  I strongly urge my colleagues not to support this amendment. It \nreflects some serious changes from the judgment made by the Budget \nCommittee and it will take down funding, approximately $430 million cut \nfor HUD-VA would be just about equal to the increase planned for VA \nmedical care, or it would equal about one-half of the planned Superfund \nreserve fund increase.\n  These are vital priorities that have been debated on this floor in \nthe past. We spent many months working to find additional offsets to \nput money into the environment. And if any of my colleagues are \ninterested in the environment and are concerned about assuring that we \nhave adequate funds to protect the environment, to clean it up, to \nleave the kind of environment we want to leave for our children, I urge \nthem not to support this amendment to take money out of the \nenvironment.\n  Mr. President, I reserve the remainder of the time, and I yield the \nfloor.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina.\n\n\n                             Point of Order\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I yield just 1 minute.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a page from the \n``Major Congressional Action'' of the Congressional Quarterly Almanac \nof 1980.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                $8.2 Billion Reconciliation Bill Cleared\n\n       For the first time in the six-year history of the \n     congressional budget process, lawmakers in 1980 approved \n     ``reconciliation'' legislation designed to trim the fiscal \n     1981 budget deficit by more than $8.2 billion.\n       The bill (HR 7765--PL 96-499) cut back programs already on \n     the books to achieve outlay savings of $4.6 billion in the \n     year that began Oct. 1, 1980. It included revenue-raising \n     provisions expected to yield $3.6 billion during the year.\n       Congress completed action on the reconciliation bill Dec. 3 \n     when the Senate adopted the conference report on the measure \n     (H Rept 96-1479) by an 83-4 vote. The House had approved the \n     conference report earlier that day 334-45. (Senate vote 487, \n     p. 70-S; House vote 581, p. 168-H)\n       Although some members castigated the bill as a ``backdoor'' \n     method for creating new federal programs and expanding old \n     ones, most participants in debate on the measure hailed it as \n     a clear signal that Congress intended to get control of \n     federal spending.\n       As Rep. Delbert L. Latta, R-Ohio, ranking minority member \n     of the House Budget Committee, told House members: ``[I]f any \n     of my colleagues are thinking about voting against this \n     reconciliation, just keep this in mind, that if you vote \n     against it, you are saying you vote for $8.2 billion more \n     deficit for fiscal 1981.''\n       The final vote on reconciliation was the culmination of a \n     six-month odyssey that started when Congress included in its \n     first 1981 budget resolution (H Con Res 307) a provision \n     requiring that authorizing committees come up with $6.4 \n     billion in spending cuts in existing programs and $4.2 \n     billion in new revenues. (Budget resolution, p. 108)\n       The Senate approved its version (S 2885), S 2939) of the \n     reconciliation legislation in action June 30 and July 23, and \n     the House passed its bill Sept. 4. The largest conference in \n     the history of Congress, including more than 100 conferees, \n     convened Sept. 18.\n       The conference itself took two months. Although many \n     discrepancies were resolved quickly, the knottiest issues--\n     involving cost-of-living increases for military and federal \n     retirees, changes in Medicare and Medicaid, child nutrition \n     programs, mortgage subsidy bonds and the crude oil windfall \n     profits tax--delayed a final compromise until late November.\n       The ultimate conference agreement fell short of the $10.6 \n     billion in savings targeted by the first budget resolution. \n     It provided cuts of $4.631 billion in outlays ($3.092 billion \n     in budget authority) and $3.645 billion in new revenues, for \n     a total package of $8.276 billion in savings. The bill \n     projected total savings for fiscal 1981-85 at $50.38 billion \n     in outlays and $29.2 billion in additional revenues.\n\n\n                               provisions\n\n       As cleared by Congress, H.R. 7765 provided for the \n     following spending reductions and revenue increases:\n\n\n                          spending reductions\n\n       Education and Labor, $840 million in budget authority and \n     $826 million in outlays. Savings were achieved by lowering \n     federal child nutrition subsidies and reducing participation \n     by higher-income students in meals programs; facilitating \n     collection of and increasing the interest rates for student \n     loans; and limiting cost-of-living adjustments for Federal \n     Employees Compensation Act benefits for job-related accidents \n     to an annual basis.\n       Conferees also, however, extended the authorizations for \n     several child nutrition programs--extensions that were not \n     part of either the House or Senate reconciliation bills. \n     (Story, p. 453)\n       Post Office and Civil Service, $429 million in budget \n     authority and $463 million in outlays. Savings were achieved \n     by cutting the authorization for pubic service appropriations \n     to the Postal Service and repealing ``look back'' cost-of-\n     living (COLA) benefits provisions for retiring federal \n     employees, which allowed them to receive the benefit of\n\n[[Page S5422]]\n\n     the previous COLA. Conferees did not change the current \n     twice-a-year COLA benefits for military and federal retirees, \n     which would have saved more than $700 million; the Senate had \n     agreed to this modification. Conferees also prohibited the \n     Postal Service from doing away with six-day mail deliveries.\n       Highway, Rail and Airport Programs, $375 million in budget \n     authority and $917 million in outlays. Savings were achieved \n     by limiting obligational authority for highways, reducing the \n     authorization of the National Highway Traffic Safety \n     Administration, restricting railroad rehabilitation, limiting \n     funds for airport development, planning and noise control \n     grants.\n       Veterans' Programs, although the reconciliation bill itself \n     did not make any cuts in veterans' programs, the conference \n     report cited savings of $487 million in budget authority and \n     $493 million in outlays from veterans' legislation already \n     enacted. These savings came from limiting burial allowances \n     and terminating certain flight and correspondence training.\n       Small Business, $800 million in budget authority and $600 \n     million in outlays. The savings reflected revisions in \n     disaster loan programs included on the Small Business \n     Development Act of 1980 (PL 96-302). (Story, p. 546)\n       Health, $12 million in budget authority and $915 million in \n     outlays. Savings were to come, in part, from deferring until \n     September 1981 the periodic interim payments to hospitals and \n     revising Medicare reimbursements so they were based on fees \n     charged when the service was performed rather than when the \n     claim was processed.\n       Although the health conferees agreed to more than 80 new \n     provisions in Medicare and Medicaid programs, many of the \n     changes resulted in adding costs rather than savings. The new \n     health benefits programs included expansion of coverage for \n     home health services, benefits for care in outpatient \n     rehabilitation facilities and increases in payments for \n     outpatient physical therapy. (Story, p. 459)\n       Unemployment Compensation, $32 million in budget authority \n     and $147 million in outlays. Savings were achieved by ending \n     the federal reimbursement to states for compensation paid to \n     former Comprehensive Employment and Training Act (CETA) \n     workers; eliminating the federal payment for the first week \n     of extended benefits in states that did not require \n     recipients to wait a week before obtaining benefits; and \n     denying extended benefits to those who did not meet certain \n     work-related requirements.\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I read the first three paragraphs:\n\n       For the first time in the six-year history of the \n     congressional budget process, lawmakers in 1980 approved \n     ``reconciliation'' legislation designed to trim the fiscal \n     1981 budget deficit by more than $8.2 million.\n       The bill . . . cut back programs already on the books to \n     achieve outlay savings of $4.6 billion in the year that began \n     Oct. 1, 1980. It included revenue-raising provisions expected \n     to yield $3.6 billion during the year.\n       Congress completed action on the reconciliation bill Dec. 3 \n     when the Senate adopted the conference report on the measure \n     . . . by an 83-4 vote. The House had approved the conference \n     report earlier that day 334-45. . .\n\n  And on. The rest of it, of course, is printed in the Record.\n  The facts themselves support the position taken here. The authority \nfor this absurd ruling is totally out of context from the idea of the \nbudget process and restrictions thereof. It was in response to the \nconcurrent resolution instructions to the Finance Committee. It was not \na reconciliation bill. The title of the bill itself said:\n\n       The assistant legislative clerk read as follows: ``A bill \n     (H.R. 5559) to make changes in certain income tax provisions \n     of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954, and for other \n     purposes.''\n\n  It was a separate bill. It was not reconciliation, because we tried \nto get reconciliation earlier, and we finally got it 5 years after the \nBudget Act had been passed. There it is. The Congressional Quarterly, \ntotally impartial, said the first reconciliation act. I will get the \nother Congressional Records. So the very authority for this ruling is \ntotally unfounded. We ought to overrule this ruling, so to speak, so we \ncan maintain the integrity of the budget process and the integrity of \nthe Senate itself.\n  I thank the distinguished ranking member.\n  Mr. EXON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, time and time again, we are proving the \npoint that the theory behind the ruling of the Chair, as we understand \nit, which is totally faulty, has been destroyed --that theory has been \ndestroyed completely--by the fact that we have proven beyond any doubt \nthat the 1975 act, or whenever it was, that evidently the \nParliamentarian is using as a basis for his theory is wrong.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Wrong as it can be.\n  Mr. EXON. Senator Long was on another course altogether. He was \ncutting taxes. He was not using the reconciliation process, as we know \nand understand it, as part of the budget bill.\n  The fact that words were used somewhere along the line is totally \nwrong when a Parliamentarian so rules because it is a faulty ruling, \nand I think most lawyers who look at it objectively will so agree.\n  I retain the remainder of our time, and I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I ask the Senator from Texas, is he prepared \nto go forward?\n  Mr. GRAMM. I am, Mr. President.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I yield the distinguished Senator from Texas \n8 minutes on the argument on the appeal of the ruling on the point of \norder.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, there is one thing you have to hand our \nDemocratic colleagues, they are absolutely consistent on tax policy. \nThey are always consistent, and they are consistently wrong. They have \nthree rules on taxes, and they never, ever violate them:\n  Rule No. 1 is that tax increases are always fair, they are always the \nright thing to do, and they are always supported.\n  Rule No. 2 is that tax cuts are always unfair, they are always for \nthe rich, just as only rich people are ever taxed by tax increases, and \nthey are totally consistent in applying these two rules.\n\n  If there were a rule No. 3, it would be ``see rules 1 and 2 above.''\n  What Senator Daschle is trying to do is stop us from voting on a tax \ncut, period. I remind my colleagues that this fund that we are setting \nup, this so-called reserve fund, provides a tax cut to working \nfamilies, basically a $500 tax credit per child to working families who \nnow have the highest tax burden in American history.\n  When I was a boy 8 years old in 1950, the average family in America \nwith two children was sending $1 out of every $50 it earned to \nWashington, DC. Today, the average family with two children is sending \n$1 out of every $4 it earns to Washington, DC, and what we are trying \nto do is to reduce the tax burden on working families, especially \nworking families with children.\n  Under our budget, we cannot give a tax cut larger than the spending \ncuts that we have written in the budget or we are violating our own \nbudget and we are subject to a point of order. So we are not debating \ndeficits here, we are basically debating whether or not we be allowed \nto cut spending and cut taxes on working families.\n  The Democrats always take the view that tax increases are good and \nthey are always on the rich. In 1993, when they imposed, without a \nsingle Republican vote, the largest tax increase in American history, \ntheir argument was, this is a tax on rich people. Nobody making less \nthan $115,000 a year is going to pay this tax. Well, it turned out it \nhad a gasoline tax in it. They tried to have a Btu tax equivalent to a \ngasoline tax of 7 cents a gallon. What they were able to pass was a \n4.3-cents a gallon tax on gasoline. It did not go to build highways. It \nwent to general fund of the Government to spend. They taxed working \npeople who have to drive their cars and their trucks to work to give \nmoney to people who do not work.\n  Secondly, they taxed Social Security benefits. The President proposed \ntaxing anybody who was rich, by his definition, who made $25,000 a \nyear.\n  When people raised questions about it, he said: ``Well, you know, \nmany of these people own their own homes, and if they had to rent the \nhome you could count that as income, if they own their refrigerator and \nthey rented that, if they got an insurance policy or a little savings \naccount.'' So shamed were Democrats in Congress that they did raise the \nlevel at which you started taxing their Social Security benefits to \n$34,000 a year.\n  By their definition, those are rich people. They were going to tax \nJohn Q. Astor, we were told. As it turned out, 80 percent of those \ntaxes on this top 1 percent of income earners turned out to be Joe \nBrown and Son hardware store.\n  But the one thing you have to admire the Democrats about, they are \nabsolutely consistent. And that is, they always raise taxes. They \nalways raise\n\n[[Page S5423]]\n\ntaxes. And they always say that only rich people pay taxes.\n  They are also consistent in that they never support cutting taxes. \nWhat we are trying to do in this bill is to give a $500 tax credit for \nworking families. That tax credit phases out as all deductions do, at \nhigh-income levels.\n  The plain truth is, most American families never become truly \neconomically successful until they are older and therefore almost by \ndefinition their children have grown up, gotten married, graduated from \ncollege. Mr. President, 75 percent of the tax cut we are talking about \ngoes to families that make $75,000 or less. But following their basic \nrule that every tax increase is fair and every tax cut is unfair, they \nare against it.\n  I just want to remind my colleagues before they vote on this, that \nunder the Clinton budget, if it were implemented, we would have the \nhighest tax burden in American history at the Federal level, 19.3 cents \nout of every $1 earned by every American on average will come to the \nFederal Government to be spent.\n  What that means for working Americans is that for the first time in \nhistory, over 30 cents, in fact 30.4 cents, out of every $1 earned by \nevery American family on average is not going to be spent by the people \nwho earned it: it is going to be spent by their Government at the \nState, local, or Federal level.\n  Our colleagues who object to cutting taxes for working families say, \nthis is only fair. What they really believe but they do not want to \ntell us is, they believe Government can do a better job of spending \nmoney than working families can. They believe that a two-wage earner \nfamily where both the husband and the wife are out working hard, they \nare making about $50,000 a year, or $60,000 a year, when they combine \ntheir two incomes--we are trying to let them keep $1,000 more a year to \ninvest in their own family and their own future. The Democrats are \ntrying to use a parliamentary maneuver to prevent us from voting on \nthat because they want to spend that money. They do not want working \nfamilies to be able to spend it.\n  This fits their principle. In the mid-1980's people discovered that \nin foreign policy the Democrats always blamed America first. What we \nare discovering in the 1990's is in domestic policy, they always tax \nAmerica first. According to them, every tax is fair, every tax cut is \nunfair, every tax increase is paid for by rich people. Even if they are \nSocial Security recipients making $25,000 a year, counting half of \ntheir Social Security, even if they are driving a pickup truck to work, \nDemocrats think they are rich when it comes to raising their taxes.\n  But when working families who are struggling every single day to make \nends meet--and they are watching the Government squander their money--\nwhen we try to let them keep $1,000 more a year to invest in their own \nchildren and their own families, somehow that is unfair, somehow \nsuddenly they are rich.\n  In truth, for the Democrats, anybody that works for a living is rich. \nWell, I think working families can do a better job. That is why I think \nit is absolutely imperative that we defeat this parliamentary maneuver \nand that we have an opportunity to vote on cutting taxes for working \nfamilies. I think they deserve the tax cut. I intend to vote for it. I \nyield the floor.\n  Mr. BOND addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I yield myself such time as I may require \noff the resolution. I ask the Senator from Texas if he will spend a \nminute with me.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Sure.\n  Mr. BOND. Talking about the taxation philosophy. I wonder if he has \ntaken a look at the amendments presented on this budget resolution.\n  Does the Senator see a theme in the amendments that have been \npresented in this budget resolution?\n  Mr. GRAMM. Well, I have not looked at the numbers. I would like to be \neducated on it. But as I look at them, we have a minimum of six \namendments where the Democrats want to raise taxes and spend the money. \nAnd the number I looked at is that the tax increase was very \nsubstantial, over $180 billion total.\n  Mr. BOND. I say to my good friend from Texas, I show to my other \nfriends, just some rough calculations we have done. So far, we have six \ntax increases that are proposed in amendments on this budget \nresolution. The Senator from West Virginia, Senator Rockefeller, $50 \nbillion; Senator Boxer, $18 billion; Senator Wyden, $1 billion; Senator \nKerry, $48 billion; Senator Kerry, $6 billion; Senator Byrd, $65 \nbillion. As we calculate that, that comes up to about $188 billion.\n  Mr. GRAMM. What would they do with that money?\n  Mr. BOND. As I understand it, I say to the Senator, that would not go \nfor tax relief. That would go for increased spending.\n  Now we are getting up--the record was set, I believe, in 1993, where \nwe had a $240 billion tax increase. We still have a few hours left on \nthis resolution, and all we need is about, as I calculate it, about $52 \nbillion more in tax increases, and we could go over that $240 billion.\n  Does the Senator think maybe there is an effort to break that record?\n  Mr. GRAMM. I would say, if the Senator would yield, it is their \nrecord. It was the 1993 tax increase. And let me predict, not having \nseen what taxes those are, I bet you all those taxes are supposedly on \nrich people, people that drive automobiles and trucks and people that \nwork for a living, which by definition are rich people. In fact, \nanybody that is taxed is rich and anybody whose taxes you cut are rich.\n  Mr. BOND. I see our distinguished chairman of the Budget Committee \nhere, whose good office is responsible for helping frame this overall \nbudget debate. I am happy to yield to him if he has some comments on \nthis at this time.\n  Mr. DOMENICI addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Parliamentary inquiry. Since I was absent, I would like \nto be brought current. How much time in toto is still available for \nboth sides on the resolution?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There are 57 minutes for the Senator from New \nMexico; 56 minutes for the Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Boy, are we doing well. We must just be in sync.\n  Mr. EXON. We agree on something.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I am going to speak to this, but I ask, in my absence \nhas anybody come to the floor with additional amendments? Are we using \ntime to make our points here or is somebody coming with amendments?\n  Mr. EXON. The Senator and I have appealed over and over again to \npeople to come to the floor or at least call us and tell us they are \nnot going to offer the amendments. We have heard nothing from our side \nof the aisle on that. If the Senator has heard of anybody on his side \nof the aisle, that would be a step in the right direction.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. We have not.\n  Mr. EXON. To answer the Senator's question, it would appear to me \nthat neither Republican Senators nor Democratic Senators seem anxious \nto come over and claim some time to offer the amendments that they said \nthey thought was important enough to be considered. So that is all I \nknow about the proposition. Nothing evidently has changed, I say to the \nchairman of the committee.\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I thank the Senator very much.\n  I shortly will offer three amendments on behalf of Senators on this \nside, one of them on behalf of Senator McCain and two on behalf of \nSenator Faircloth. Obviously we will not speak to them. They will be \nput on the same list for a vote when the vote comes.\n  Mr. President, I want to use about 2 minutes here to just make an \nobservation and make an inquiry of the Chair.\n  First, I do not ask the Chair or the Parliamentarian for any \ninformation on this, but it is obvious that the Byrd rule by definition \ndoes not apply to provisions of a budget resolution. It applies to the \nlegislative language in the reconciliation bills.\n  Having said that, I have a parliamentary inquiry. It is brief. If a \nreconciliation bill reduced revenues in the outyears beyond the period \nof the reconciliation bill, but as a whole did not increase the deficit \nby virtue of offsetting spending reductions or revenue increases, would \nthe revenue reductions violate the Byrd rule?\n\n[[Page S5424]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. No, they would not.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I thank the Chair.\n  Now, Mr. President, I have an amendment.\n  Mr. EXON. May I inquire of my colleague, we have additional debate \nthat was on the matter before the Senate. Do you wish us to finish that \nor do you want to go ahead? The Senator from South Carolina also wants \nto speak.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. It will take me 3 minutes to get these amendments done.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4022\n\n    (Purpose: To express the sense of the Senate regarding spectrum \n   auctions and their effect on the integrity of the budget process)\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I have an amendment regarding spectrum \nopenings and the effect of their integrity on the process, and I send \nthe amendment to the desk and ask for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from New Mexico [Mr. Domenici], for Mr. McCain, \n     proposes an amendment numbered 4022.\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC.  . SENSE OF THE SENATE--TRUTH IN BUDGETING.\n\n       It is the Sense of the Senate that:\n       (a) The Congressional Budget Office has scored revenue \n     expected to be raised from the auction of Federal \n     Communications Commission licenses for various services;\n       (b) For budget scoring purposes, the Congress has assumed \n     that such auctions would occur in a prompt and expeditious \n     manner and that revenue raised by such auctions would flow to \n     the federal treasury;\n       (c) The Resolution assumes that the revenue to be raised \n     from auctions totals billions of dollars;\n       (d) The Resolution makes assumptions that services would be \n     auctioned where the Federal Communications Commission has not \n     yet conducted auctions for such services, such as Local \n     Multipoint Distribution Service (LMDS), licenses for paging \n     services, final broadband PCS licenses, narrow band PCS \n     licenses, licenses for unserved cellular, and Digital Audio \n     Radio (DARS), and other subscription services, revenue from \n     which has been assumed in Congressional budgetary \n     calculations and in determining the level of the deficit; and\n       (e) The Commission's service rules can dramatically affect \n     license values and auction revenues and therefore the \n     Commission should act expeditiously and without further delay \n     to conduct auctions of licenses in a manner that maximizes \n     revenue, increases efficiency, and enhances competition for \n     any service for which auction revenues have been scored by \n     the Congressional Budget Office and/or counted for budgetary \n     purposes in an Act of Congress.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, this amendment expresses the sense of the \nSenate that when spectrum auctions are assumed in the budget \nresolution, that those auctions should occur in an expeditious manner \nand in a manner that is most efficient. The amendment does not force \nthe FCC to act on any fashion other than that which is most \nappropriate.\n  However, Mr. President, I am concerned that the Commission move \nforward with auctions.\n  This amendment is about much more than auctions. It is about truth in \nbudgeting. When the Budget Committee drafts a budget plan that includes \nauctions, it is assumed that those auctions will take place. To the \nCommission's credit, it has acted to auction much of the spectrum. And \nto date, over $20.2 billion has been raised by auction.\n  But we must continue to move forward. In order for the Government's \nbooks to actually balance, we must bring in money we intend to spend.\n  One such example is the issue of Local Multipoint Distribution \nService [LMDS]. The Commission's rulemaking proceeding on LMDS is over \n3 years old. For 3 years we have been waiting for auction revenues. In \nthe mean time, LMDS technology which was developed by American \nentrepreneurs is being implemented elsewhere in such places as Canada, \nSouth America, and Asia.\n  LMDS will provide homes and offices with video, telephony, and other \ninteractive data transfer applications including high speed Internet \nconnections. In residential areas, for example, LMDS could provide a \nfamily with over 60 digital TV stations, 200 video-on-demand channels, \ntwo telephone lines, and a high-speed Internet connection.\n  But, Mr. President, again let me repeat that this amendment is not \nabout LMDS or any other specific service. There are other subscriptions \nservices that are set to be auctioned that I would hope the FCC soon \nacts on. I would hope that the Commission move forward on those matters \nalso and the FCC view this amendment as our imprimatur to move forward. \nBut as I noted, this amendment is about the FCC acting in an \nexpeditious manner in order to ensure that when the Congress assumes \nthat money will be coming in, it is in fact coming in.\n  Mr. President, I want to commend the Budget Committee and its \nchairman for moving the issue of spectrum auctions forward. For the \nmost part, it has been reconciliation legislation that has mandated \npast auctions The Budget Committee has recognized that spectrum is a \npublic asset, that it has great value, and that the American people \nshould not only benefit by its use, but should benefit from its sale.\n  Now we must ensure that the auctions the Budget Committee has the \nforesight to call for do indeed occur. I would hope the Congress would \nadopt this amendment and that the FCC would act as instructed by the \nSenate.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4023\n\n (Purpose: To express the sense of the Senate regarding welfare reform)\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, this is proposed by Senator Faircloth \nand expresses the sense of the Senate that balanced budget legislation \nshould also contain a strategy for reducing the national debt. I send \nthe amendment to the desk and ask for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from New Mexico [Mr. Domenici], for Mr. \n     Faircloth, proposes an amendment numbered 4023.\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC.   . SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING WELFARE REFORM.\n\n       The Senate finds that--\n       S. Con. Res. 57 assumes substantial savings from welfare \n     reform; and\n       Children born out of wedlock are five times more likely to \n     be poor and about ten times more likely to be extremely poor \n     and therefore are more likely to receive welfare benefits \n     than children from two parent families; and\n       High rates of out-of-wedlock births are associated with a \n     host of other social pathologies; for example, children of \n     single mothers are twice as likely to drop out of high \n     school; boys whose fathers are absent are more likely to \n     engage in criminal activities; and girls in single-parent \n     families are three times more likely to have children out of \n     wedlock themselves; therefore\n       It is the sense of the Senate that any comprehensive \n     legislation sent to the President that balances the budget by \n     a certain date and that includes welfare reform provisions \n     and that is agreed to by the Congress and the President shall \n     also contain to the maximum extent possible a strategy for \n     reducing the rate of out-of-wedlock births and encouraging \n     family formation.\n\n  Mr. FAIRCLOTH. Mr. President, President Clinton devoted two of his \nweekly radio addresses this month to the topic of welfare reform.\n  Like President Clinton, I was elected in 1992, and welfare reform was \na key issue in my campaign. Since then I have introduced welfare reform \nbills in the 103d Congress and in this Congress as well.\n  The current impasse on welfare reform has existed since the \nPresident's second veto of welfare legislation sent to him by the \nCongress. I found the President's recent remarks on welfare reform to \nbe particularly aggravating because so much agreement exists between \nthe President and the Congress on the problems in our welfare system, \nand on most of the solutions, and yet bipartisan legislation passed by \nCongress has not become law.\n  In his May 4 address, the President said, ``The American people need \na welfare system that honors American values: work, family and personal \nresponsibility.''\n  The issues related to family and personal responsibility have been of \nparticular interest to me. In fact President Clinton and I strongly \nagree on the problems in this area. On January\n\n[[Page S5425]]\n\n29 of this year, when the President appointed Dr. Henry Foster to \ncoordinate the administration's new National Campaign to Reduce Teen \nPregnancy, the President said:\n\n       This morning we want to talk about teen pregnancy, because \n     it is a moral problem and a personal problem and a challenge \n     that individual young people should face and because it has \n     reached such proportions that it is a very significant \n     economic and social problem for the United States.\n\n  He went on to say:\n\n       We know * * * that almost all the poor children in this \n     country are living with one parent; that there are very, very \n     few poor children, without regard to race, region or income, \n     living in two-parent married households.\n\n  He continues by saying:\n\n       We know that there are an awful lot of good, single parents \n     out there doing their best, but we also know it would be \n     better if no teenager ever had a child out of wedlock; that \n     it is not the right thing to do, and it is not a good thing \n     for the children's future and for the future of the country.\n\n  Mr. President, I agree wholeheartedly with those points. Seventy-two \npercent of teenage births occur outside of marriage. I have stood here \nmany times and emphasized that welfare reform that does not \naggressively seek to reverse the rising rate of out-of-wedlock births, \nwill not break the cycle of welfare dependency that is consuming more \nand more of our young people.\n  I have not been alone in sounding the alarm on this problem. Many of \nmy Republican colleagues have joined me, and we have all learned from \nour friend, Senator Moynihan, who first conducted ground-breaking \nresearch on this topic almost 30 years ago.\n  It is my strong belief that illegitimacy is the root cause of welfare \ndependency. Children raised in single parent homes are six times more \nlikely to be poor than those raised by two parents, and girls raised in \nsingle parent homes are three times more likely to have children out of \nwedlock as well.\n  During last year's welfare reform debate, I advocated several \napproaches aimed at reducing illegitimacy. I supported the House \nefforts to limit the incentives in our current welfare program that, in \neffect, reward illegitimacy. I was also very proud that our welfare \nreform bill included a provision that I offered, which would promote \nand fund programs to encourage children to abstain from sexual activity \nbefore marriage.\n  I'll let the President finish my point on illegitimacy. In the \nstatement that accompanied the welfare reform bill that he sent to \nCongress in 1994, he said ``Preventing teen pregnancy and out-of-\nwedlock births is a critical part of welfare reform.'' I agree.\n  Mr. President, in his radio addresses, the President has highlighted \nthe agreement that exists on welfare reform and also praised the States \nfor work they have done on their own. In his most recent radio address, \nthe President tried to take credit for innovative reforms recently \nproposed by the Republican Governor of Wisconsin, Tommy Thompson.\n  I think it is ironic that the greatest barrier to these innovative \nState programs is the current Federal welfare system which requires \nStates to negotiate a lengthy, and potentially partisan, waiver process \nthrough the Department of Health and Human Services. By refusing to \nsign welfare reform legislation, the President is denying States the \nflexibility that our welfare reform bill was designed to provide.\n  Even though the President seemed to have endorsed the Wisconsin plan \non Saturday, today's Washington Post contained a statement from White \nHouse Deputy Chief of Staff, Harold Ickes, that details of the \nWisconsin proposal would have to be changed before the Department of \nHealth and Human Services would approve the wavier.\n  With all this agreement that seems to exist between the Congress and \nthe President, why can't the American people have the welfare reform \nthat the Congress has passed, and the President has promised them?\n  Mr. President, my amendment simply states that it is the sense of the \nSenate that if welfare reform is included in new balanced budget \nlegislation, that those provisions contain a strategy to reduce the \nincidence of out of wedlock births as well as encourage the formation \nof two-parent families.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4024\n\n(Purpose: To express the sense of the Senate regarding reduction of the \n                             national debt)\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask \nfor its immediate consideration. This is on behalf of Senator Faircloth \nreferencing deficit reduction and the national debt.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from New Mexico [Mr. Domenici], for Mr. \n     Faircloth, proposes an amendment numbered 4024.\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC.  . SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING REDUCTION OF THE \n                   NATIONAL DEBT.\n\n       S. Con. Res. 57 projects a public debt in Fiscal Year 1997 \n     of $5,400,000,000,000;\n       S. Con. Res. 57 projects that the public debt will be \n     6,500,000,000,000 in the Fiscal Year 2002 when the budget \n     resolution projects a unified budget surplus;\n       This accumulated debt represents a significant financial \n     burden that will require excessive taxation and lost economic \n     opportunity for future generations of the United States; \n     therefore\n       It is the sense of the Senate that any comprehensive \n     legislation sent to the President that balances the budget by \n     a certain date and that is agreed to by the Congress and the \n     President shall also contain a strategy for reducing the \n     national debt of the Untied States.\n\n  Mr. FAIRCLOTH. Mr. President, this amendment would very simply \nexpress the sense of the Senate that if we enact a balanced budget plan \nthis year--that such legislation should also contain a strategy for \nreducing the national debt.\n  The budget resolution we are debating today is a plan to balance the \nbudget by the year 2002. But by the year 2002, our national debt will \nbe $6.5 trillion.\n  Mr. President, this debt represents a massive burden on the American \npeople and future generations of Americans. I am deeply concerned about \nthis debt burden that we have placed on our children, grandchildren, \nand children yet born.\n  The budget resolution is a plan to end the deficit spending--which is \ncertainly what we need. But I feel just as strongly that we need a plan \nto reduce this debt.\n  It took this country nearly 200 years to accumulate a debt of $1 \ntrillion--and in the last 16 years the debt will have increased \nfivefold. This is not a Republican or Democrat issue--we don't need to \nassign the blame--we just need to develop a solution.\n  All this amendment would do is encourage the Senate--express that it \nis our sense that we develop proposals to deal with this massive debt \nburden.\n\n\n                             Point of Order\n\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, I am about to yield whatever time he might \nneed to the Senator from South Carolina.\n  I wish briefly to respond. How interesting it is that the debate has \nshifted from the very legitimate discussion that we were having here \nwith regard to the faulty ruling of the Chair to a charge that \nDemocrats are trying to block consideration of income tax reductions. \nNothing could be further from the truth.\n  Just repeating irresponsible charges over and over again without \nproviding any backup proof is nonsense. That has been an old debating \ntechnique for a long, long time. When the facts are not on your side, \ntalk nonsense.\n  Mr. President, I want to get back, and I am sure my friend from South \nCarolina wants to get back, to the underlying problem that we have here \nthat is far more than just one single independent ruling of the Chair. \nIt is going to have far-reaching adverse effects on the U.S. Senate for \nas long as we can imagine into the future.\n  Instead of addressing that, the Republicans come forth with charts. \nThey say we are trying to stop the tax cut. We are not trying to stop \nthe tax cut. All we want is the tax cut to be brought up in the usual \nfashion, to be debated in the usual fashion under the usual procedures. \nWe are trying to expose this glaring trick that the Republicans are \ntrying, by separating their reconstruction instructions into three\n\n[[Page S5426]]\n\nseparate bills. The last one with regard to tax cuts would come in \nSeptember of this year, a couple months before the election. Of course, \nI would be the last to accuse the Republicans of playing politics with \nthis --let me be the first.\n  We have just seen some charts presented here. They have done this \nbefore. They set up a straw man on fake straw and then they tear it \ndown. They just had a list of Senators up there. They totaled up what \nthose Senators had proposed and how much it would cost. No one has \nadvocated raising taxes by the amount asserted from the Senator from \nMissouri. It is simply not the case that one can add up all of the \noffsets for amendments that fail. If the Senate chooses not to use an \noffset in one amendment, it is perfectly legitimate to try and use the \nsame offset in a second amendment. When we do that, the Republicans set \nup a straw man--false numbers, false charges, false assumptions. Once \nagain, setting up a straw man may fool the people of the United States \ntemporarily, but not for long.\n  I want to correct just one more thing. I want to correct the record \non the statistics used by the Senator from Texas. The share of the \neconomy that goes to revenues to fund the Government is not at record \nlevels. Let me repeat that: The Senator from Texas said that the share \nof the economy that goes to revenues to fund the Government is not at \nrecord levels. It was higher in 1969. It was higher in 1970. It was \nhigher in 1982. Sure, sure, we would all like to have lower taxes. The \nquestion is, what should come first? What should come first, Mr. \nPresident? Balancing the budget of the United States or enacting tax \ncuts that we all would likely vote for once we get a balanced budget?\n  I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, you can find the first two pages of the \nbudget resolution conference report for fiscal year 1976 referred to as \nthe authority for the Parliamentarian's rule about reconciliation back \nin 1975. I ask unanimous consent to have it printed in the Record. The \nreport dated April 21, 1975 was submitted by Mr. Muskie, from the \ncommittee of conference. It is only a few pages, but I think it ought \nto be included.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n      Second Concurrent Resolution on the Budget, Fiscal Year 1976\n\n       Mr. Muskie, from the committee on conference, submitted the \n     following conference report to accompany H. Con. Res. 466:\n       The committee of conference on the disagreeing votes of the \n     two Houses on the amendment of the Senate to the concurrent \n     resolution\n       H. Con. Res. 466) revising the congressional budget for the \n     United States Government for the fiscal year 1976, and \n     directing certain reconciliation action, having met, after \n     full and free conference, have agreed to recommend and do \n     recommend to their respective Houses as follows:\n       That the House recede from its disagreement to the \n     amendment of the Senate and agree to the same with an \n     amendment as follows:\n       In lieu of the matter proposed to be inserted by the Senate \n     amendment insert the following:\n\n     That the Congress hereby determines and declares, pursuant to \n     section 310(a) of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974, that \n     for the fiscal year beginning on July 1, 1975--\n       (1) The appropriate level of total budget outlays is \n     $374,900,000,000;\n       (2) The appropriate level of total new budget authority is \n     $408,000,000,000;\n       (3) The amount of the deficit in the budget which is \n     appropriate in the light of economic conditions and all other \n     relevant factors is $74,100,000,000;\n       (4) The recommended level of Federal revenues is \n     $300,800,000,000, and the House Committee on Ways and Means \n     and the Senate Committee on Finance shall submit to their \n     respective Houses legislation to decrease Federal revenues by \n     approximately $6,400,000,000; and\n       (5) The appropriate level of the public debt is \n     $622,600,000,000.\n       Sec. 2. The Congress hereby determines and declares, in the \n     manner provided in section 301(a) of the Congressional Budget \n     Act of 1974, that for the transition quarter beginning on \n     July 1, 1976--\n       (1) The appropriate level of total budget outlays is \n     $101,700,000,000;\n       (2) The appropriate level of total budget authority is \n     $91,100,000,000;\n       (3) The amount of the deficit in the budget which is \n     appropriate in the light of economic conditions and all other \n     relevant factors is $15,700,000,000;\n       (4) The recommended level Federal revenues is \n     $86,000,000,000; and\n       (5) The appropriate level of the public debt is \n     $641,000,000,000. And the Senate agree to the same.\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, a careful reading of this particular \nbudget resolution finds no reconciliation instructions. How can you \nhave reconciliation without reconciliation instructions?\n  I referred in my original comments to the fact that our distinguished \ncolleague, the chairman of the Finance Committee at the time, Senator \nLong, wanted it to appear as reconciliation because he was trying to \nlimit debate and limit amendments. He was probably the cleverest of all \nParliamentarians around here. He always stood in the well there: ``Yes, \nyes, Senator, I will take your amendment.'' He just took all these \namendments, went over there, and you would never see them again. I \nremember it well.\n  But there was, as the record will show, no reconciliation--he called \nit and they gave him limited time, but it was not reconciliation. As \nchairman of the Finance Committee, he was complying with a particular \nbill. Just like now, under this concurrent resolution that we direct \nthe Commerce Committee or the Armed Services Committee or any other \ncommittee, and they comply. They come up with their particular bill. \nThat is not reconciliation.\n  As further authority, Mr. President, I refer to the statement made at \nthat particular time by myself on December 3, 1980. I quote:\n\n       Every Senator who signed the conference agreement, and \n     every Senator who votes to adopt it, has earned a share of \n     the credit for this first historic exercise of the \n     reconciliation power.\n\n  That was the first time we were able to pass a reconciliation bill, \nDecember 1980--there was not any kind of authority for reconciliation \nback in 1975.\n  Let me quote Mr. Henry Bellmon, ranking member at that particular \ntime on the Republican side:\n\n       Mr. President, this truly is a historic occasion. Today we \n     complete for the first time an important part of the Budget \n     Act called reconciliation.\n\n  Mr. President, you cannot be more clear than that. They are using \n1975, the actions taken by the chairman of the Finance Committee and a \nspurious ruling at that particular because there was no such thing as \nreconciliation instructions. Senator Long put in, as I said, and I read \nthe particular title, a tax bill. It is a separate bill. It is not \nreconciliation. It is ``a bill (H.R. 5559) to make changes in certain \nincome tax provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954.'' That is \nnot a reconciliation bill.\n  Now, Mr. President, I am continually hearing from my distinguished \ncolleague from Texas, and they run him out every now and then with the \nlittle charts, about the biggest tax increase. It is all Presidential \npolitics--the biggest tax increase, the biggest tax increase.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent again that we include in the \nRecord from the Washington Post an article by Judy Mann back in 1995, \nJanuary 1. I ask unanimous consent the article be printed in its \nentirety in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                       [From the Washington Post]\n\n                       Fiddling With the Numbers\n\n                             (By Judy Mann)\n\n       Gov. Christine Todd Whitman, the Republican meteor from New \n     Jersey, had the unusual honor for a first-term governor of \n     being asked to deliver her party's response to President \n     Clinton's State of the Union message last week.\n       And she delivered a whopper of what can most kindly be \n     called a glaring inaccuracy.\n       Sandwiched into her Republican sales pitch was the kind of \n     line that does serious political damage: Clinton, she \n     intoned, ``imposed the biggest tax increase in American \n     history.''\n       And millions of Americans sat in front of their television \n     sets, perhaps believing that Clinton and the Democrat-\n     controlled Congress had done a real number on them.\n       The trouble is that this poster lady for tax cuts was not \n     letting any facts get in her way. But don't hold your breath \n     waiting for the talk show hosts to set the record straight.\n       The biggest tax increase in history did not occur in the \n     Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993. The biggest tax \n     increase in post-World War II history occurred in 1982 under \n     President Ronald Reagan.\n       Here is how the two compare, according to Bill Gale, a \n     specialist on tax policy and senior fellow at the Brookings \n     Institution. The 1993 act raised taxes for the next five \n     years by a gross total of $268 billion, but with the \n     expansion of the earned income tax credit to\n\n[[Page S5427]]\n\n     more working poor families, the net increase comes to $240.4 \n     billion in 1993. The Tax Equity and Fiscal Responsibility Act \n     of 1982, by comparison, increased taxes by a net of $217.5 \n     billion over five years. Nominally, then, it is true that the \n     1993 tax bill was the biggest in history.\n       But things don't work nominally. ``A dollar now is worth \n     less than a dollar was back then, so that a tax increase of, \n     say $10 billion in 1982 would be a tax increase of $15 \n     billion now,'' says Gale. In fact, if you adjust for the 48 \n     percent change in price level, the 1982 tax increase becomes \n     a $325.6 billion increase in 1993 dollars. And that makes it \n     the biggest tax increase in history by $85 billion.\n       Moreover, says Gale, the population of the country \n     increased, so that, on a per person basis, the 1993 tax \n     increase is lower than the one in 1982, and the gross \n     domestic product increased over the decade, which means that \n     personal income rose. ``Once you adjust for price \n     translation, it's not the biggest, and when you account for \n     population and GDP, it gets even smaller.''\n       He raises another point that makes this whole business of \n     tax policy just a bit more complex than the heroic tax \n     slashers would have us believe. ``The question is whether \n     [the 1993 tax increase] was a good idea or a bad idea, not \n     whether it was the biggest tax increase. Suppose it was the \n     biggest? I find it frustrating that the level of the debate \n     about stuff like this as carried on by politicians is \n     generally so low.''\n       So was it a good idea? ``We needed to reduce the deficit,'' \n     he says, ``we still need to reduce the deficit. The bond \n     market responded positively. Interest rates fell. There may \n     be a longer term benefit in that it shows Congress and the \n     president are capable of cutting the deficit even without a \n     balanced budget amendment.''\n       Other long-term benefits, he says, are that ``more capital \n     is freed up for private investment, and ultimately that can \n     result in more productive and highly paid workers.''\n       How bad was the hit for those few who did have to pay more \n     taxes? One tax attorney says that his increased taxes were \n     more than offset by savings he was able to generate by \n     refinancing the mortgage on his house at the lower interest \n     rates we've had as a result. The 1993 tax increase did \n     include a 4.3-cent-a-gallon rise in gasoline tax, which hits \n     the middle class. But most of us did not have to endure an \n     income tax increase. In 1992, the top tax rate was 31 percent \n     of the taxable income over $51,900 for single taxpayers and \n     $86,500 for married couples filing jointly. Two new tax \n     brackets were added in 1993: 36 percent for singles with \n     taxable incomes over $115,000 and married couples with \n     incomes over $140,000; and 39.6 percent for singles and \n     married couples with taxable incomes over $250,000.\n       Not exactly your working poor or even your average family.\n       The rising GOP stars are finding out that when they say or \n     do something stupid or mendacious, folks notice. The jury \n     ought to be out on Whitman's performance as governor until we \n     see the effects of supply side economics on New Jersey. But \n     in her first nationally televised performance as a \n     spokeswoman for her party, she should have known better than \n     to give the country only half the story. In the process, she \n     left a lot to be desired in one quality Americans are looking \n     for in politicians: honesty.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's 5 minutes have expired.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Let me ask for 2 more minutes.\n  Mr. EXON. I yield 2 more minutes.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I thank the distinguished Senator.\n  I read here: The biggest tax increase in history did not occur in the \nOmnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993. The biggest tax increase in \npost-World War II history occurred in 1982 under President Ronald \nReagan.\n  So I hope they would at least respect the truth every now and again \nand quit referring to the 1993 reconciliation bill as the ``biggest tax \nincrease.'' I happened to have voted for it. It is working. It has the \ndeficit cut in half. In fact, the deficit dropped another $30 billion \nsince last week.\n  Finally, Mr. President, under this limited time on April 24, 1991, we \nput in a bill--``we'' being Senator Moynihan of New York, Senator \nKasten of Wisconsin, and the Senator from South Carolina--we put in \nthat bill to cut $190 billion in tax cuts for working Americans. The \ndistinguished Senator from Texas voted against it. We said, let us put \nSocial Security on a pay-as-you-go basis. It amounted to $190 billion \nin tax cuts on working Americans.\n  You can keep running him out with his charts, but I am going to run \nout with his record. He had a chance to vote for it, and he voted \nagainst it.\n  So spare us this particular off-Broadway act that we have to watch \nevery other day or so--the biggest tax increase, and working Americans, \naround the kitchen table, and who is in the wagon and who is pulling \nit. We are in the wagon. The Congress is in the wagon. The people \noutside are the ones pulling it. The President is the one that has been \ncutting the deficit. And thank heavens for President Clinton, the only \none in town since President Johnson that has cut the deficit.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, just to add another fact to the statement \nmade by the distinguished Senator from South Carolina, that largest tax \ncut in history that he indicated came in 1982, I believe. Is that what \nhe said?\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. That is correct, tax increase.\n  Mr. EXON. I thought it might be interesting to note that the chairman \nof the Finance Committee at the time of the real largest tax increase \nin history, chairman of the committee of jurisdiction, the Finance \nCommittee at that time, was Kansas Senator Robert Dole.\n  I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I thank the ranking member, the Senator from Nebraska.\n  I must say that I was surprised to see the Senator from Texas out \nonce again railing against the Democrats in the last package that we \npassed, saying that it was just a tax package. It is very interesting.\n  The Senator from Texas is not talking much these days about deficits. \nHe is not talking about that much anymore. He is not talking much about \ndebt anymore because we are 6 months away from an election. The \nRepublicans are down by double digits in the polls. And so out comes \nthe tax bogeyman. Let us haul that one out because that one seems to \nwork pretty well. Let us run out the tax bogeyman. Let us run him \naround the track a few times.\n  Mr. President, let us read the Record. First of all, the biggest tax \nincrease occurred on their watch. They controlled the White House. They \ncontrolled the U.S. Senate. They passed the biggest tax increase. Why \ndid they do it? Because the deficits were skyrocketing. They were out \nof control. So they took action.\n  In 1993, the Democrats, when it was on our watch--we controlled the \nWhite House, we controlled the Senate, and we controlled the House--we \ntook action. We can be proud of the action we took because we reduced \nthese deficits. We have reduced them sharply. Let us just look at the \nrecord.\n  Mr. President, this compares the records of President Clinton, \nPresident Bush, and President Reagan. This is what has happened to the \ndeficits under these three Presidents. These are the deficits in \nbillions of dollars starting in 1980.\n  Ronald Reagan was elected. The deficit was about $70 billion a year. \nRonald Reagan took office. By the way, it was not just Republican \ncontrol of the White House; the Republicans controlled this body as \nwell. They controlled the U.S. Senate, and they had effective control \nof the U.S. House of Representatives. Because everyone remembers what \nbudgets passed in 1981, in 1982, in 1983, it was boll weevil Democrats \njoining with the Republican minority in the House, joining with the \nSenate majority, the Republican majority in the Senate, and a \nRepublican President.\n  What happened? Here is the record on deficits. The deficits exploded. \nThey exploded under this theory of supply-side economics. They exploded \nunder this notion that you can just cut taxes and not cut spending, and \nthat somehow it is all going to add up. The deficits went to over $200 \nbillion a year.\n  Then, we see that we had the beginning of the Bush administration, \nand again deficits took off. This time they reached $290 billion a \nyear. That is what the deficit was when Bill Clinton came into office. \nBill Clinton inherited a $290 billion budget deficit.\n  Look at the performance based on a plan that we passed in 1993 \nwithout a single Republican vote. Not one. Not one. The deficit has \ngone down each and every year.\n  This morning we were told the deficit for this year will probably \ncome in at less than $130 billion, a dramatic reduction in the budget \ndeficit, in part because of economic recovery and in part because of \nthe plan that we passed in 1993. We had the courage to stand up and do \nwhat needed to be done.\n\n  Mr. President, more needs to be done. It is not going to happen with \nthis kind of running out and saying, well, we can just cut all the \nrevenue of the Federal Government and somehow it will all\n\n[[Page S5428]]\n\nadd up. We tried that before. It failed, and it failed miserably. Debt, \ndeficits and decline, that is the direction our friends on the other \nside, at least some of them, seem to be willing to take us.\n  Mr. President, we should never ever go back to that policy of debt, \ndeficits and decline. That way lies ruination.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  Mr. EXON. May I ask a question of the Senator from North Dakota.\n  I appreciated the Senator's factual remarks, and just to back up what \nthe Senator has said, that is just not a Democratic Senator saying \nthat. That is not just a Democratic Senator saying that based on the \nfacts. The same thing was said by the Office of Management and Budget \ndirector under President Reagan. His name was David Stockman, and he \nadmitted publicly--and I believe wrote in a book--that it was a sham \nall the way through. In fact, he used the words that all of this period \nthe Senator has just alluded to was ``fiscal carnage.'' And he admitted \nthat it was a Republican fiscal carnage. I just wanted to emphasize \nthat. I am just wondering if the Senator had remembered that fact.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I actually read David Stockman's book, and he makes very \nclear that this was a policy they hoped somehow would all add up, and \nit did not. It was a miserable failure that dug a very deep hole for \nthis country.\n  Mr. President, the facts are very clear. This is the record. Nobody \ncan dispute these numbers. This is what happened.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's 5 minutes have expired.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I thank the Chair.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4007\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM addressed the Chair.\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, I would like to advise the chairman of the \ncommittee we have good news; a Senator has arrived in the Chamber to \ntalk about an amendment. The amendment was previously offered but the \nSenator from Florida seeks recognition, and at this time I hope we \ncould allot him 5 minutes charged jointly against the two sides.\n  Mr. GRAHAM addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I have no objection to the time allocation.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, on Friday I filed amendment No. 4007, \nreserving the time to discuss that amendment until today. I wish to use \nat least 5 minutes to review this very terse but important amendment.\n  This amendment, Mr. President, provides that any funds which were \nderived by the more aggressive attack on Medicare fraud would be \nreturned to the Medicare trust fund. We are facing two interrelated \nchallenges. One is combating the rampant level of fraud which exists \nwithin our Medicare program and second is ensuring the solvency of the \nMedicare trust fund.\n  It has been estimated by the General Accounting Office that the rate \nof Medicare waste, fraud and abuse is approximately 10 percent and in \nsome areas of the country is estimated to be twice that amount. If we \ncould use even the more conservative estimate, an additional 2 million \nseniors could be served each year through Medicare just by reducing the \nlevel of Medicare fraud.\n  Medicare fraud ought to be the first place we look when we are \nconsidering reductions in the Medicare Program. Fraud undermines public \nconfidence in Medicare. It is a very cost-efficient expenditure. One \ndollar spent on suppressing Medicare fraud on average will return in \nexcess of $10 in reduced costs.\n  There are a number of solutions, many of which have been contained in \nlegislation adopted by this Senate, which will allow for a \ncomprehensive assault on Medicare fraud. We have prescriptions such as \nusing the Medicare Federal hospital insurance trust fund as part of the \nsource of financing, more effective investigations and prosecutions of \nMedicare fraud. It is the intent that those savings derived by that \nmore effective effort be returned to the trust fund both to reimburse \nfor the expenses that have come out of the trust fund for the \ninvestigations and prosecutions and also the return to the trust fund \nsome of the money which was pilfered from it by the fraud itself.\n\n  Unfortunately, Mr. President, these efforts to assure that the \nsavings derived by effective programs against Medicare fraud end up \nbenefiting the trust fund for Medicare have been under assault. There \nare proposals, for instance, to divert these funds into new Federal \nspending efforts, efforts that are outside of the Medicare trust fund. \nThere are also proposals to use it to finance new tax breaks.\n  As worthy as those other spending efforts or additional tax \nreductions might be, it is not appropriate to use funds derived from \nthe Medicare trust fund through the efforts to suppress fraud which it \nfinances for any purpose other than assuring the solvency of the \nMedicare trust fund.\n  So the amendment I have filed, which is amendment No. 4007, \nessentially establishes, as do other provisions within this budget \nrecollection bill, a point of order which states, ``It shall not be in \norder for the Senate to consider any reconciliation bill, conference \nreport or otherwise which would use savings achieved through Medicare \nwaste, fraud and abuse enforcement activities as offsets for purposes \nother than improving the solvency of the Medicare Federal Hospital \nInsurance Trust Fund.''\n  So that is the essence of the amendment. It is to provide procedural \nprotections to assure this Senate, to assure the American people, and \nespecially to assure the over 35 million Americans who depend upon the \nMedicare trust fund for their hospital payments, that any funds which \nare pilfered from that trust fund, any funds which are used from that \ntrust fund for purposes of effective enforcement will be for the \nbenefit of the trust fund.\n  I urge adoption of this amendment. I thank the Chair. I thank my \ncolleague.\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, I yield 2 minutes from our time to the \nSenator from South Carolina.\n\n\n                             Point of Order\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, let me get right to the point of the \nstatement I made back in 1980 when I was chairman of the Budget \nCommittee and Mr. Giaimo of Connecticut, was chairman on the House \nside. Before I could get these records I put in a call to him. He is \ndown in Florida just below Palm Beach. He verified my memory. Lots of \ntimes my memory is pretty good way back, and very precise, and then I \ncannot remember where I parked the car, so I always like to double \ncheck when I just speak from memory. He verified that Mr. Bellmon was \nthe ranking member on the Senate side, and he and all the records show \nthat the bill was not a reconciliation bill. There were not any \nreconciliation instructions in the fiscal `76 concurrent resolution on \nthe budget, and the tax bill offered by Senator Long of Louisiana as \nthe chairman of the Finance Committee was not a part of reconciliation.\n  I thank the distinguished Senator.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3986\n\n  Mr. ABRAHAM addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. I thank the Chair.\n  I would yield myself 5 minutes to speak on and in relation to \namendment No. 3986 by Senators Wellstone and Kerry. This is an \namendment which pertains to the violent crime reduction trust fund. It \nis a sense-of-the-Senate amendment. Since the time has not been yielded \nback, I am not in a position at this point to offer a second-degree \namendment that I had considered, but I anticipate doing that at the \nappropriate moment.\n  I do want to speak in relation to this issue though because I think \nit is a fairly significant one. The sense-of-the-Senate amendment that \nhas been offered talks in terms of full funding of the violent crime \nreduction trust fund. I think, Mr. President, we should go further than \njust put this in the context of a sense of the Senate. Indeed, my \nintention is to offer a second-degree amendment which would accomplish \nthe goal of fully funding the violent crime trust fund by moving moneys \nfor the years 2001 and 2002 from function 600. It is my view that we \nshould also stop, the administration should be much more up front and \nmuch more consistent with regard to the facts concerning the COPS \nProgram, and I think in addition that we should take action to minimize \nthe administrative overhead in relation to the COPS Program. The \nsecond-degree amendment which I will offer tomorrow along with Senator \nCoverdell would try to accomplish both of these objectives. \nSpecifically, under the current law the violent crime trust fund is\n\n[[Page S5429]]\n\nset to expire in the year 2000, just 4 years from now.\n  This amendment that we intend to offer would provide the funds to \nkeep it going to the year 2002. That would mean funds for the prison \ngrants; the GREAT Program; Violence-Against-Women Program; violent \ncrime reduction programs for the Justice Department; INS, DEA, FBI; \nfunding for the immigration initiative and border control programs; \nByrne grants, and the COPS Program.\n  We will be offering this amendment in due course to the Wellstone \namendment because we feel the issue deserves more than just the sense-\nof-the-Senate recognition. We believe the trust fund needs to be \nprotected. The underlying Republican budget already fully funds the \ntrust fund. We plan to carry it forward through the year 2002.\n  In terms of the offset, it is our belief to fund this there would be \ncorresponding reductions to function 600 in the budget. For those \nMembers who might argue we should not be reducing this function below \nwhat was reported by the Senate Budget Committee, I point out that the \nRepublican budget includes significantly more funding under function \n600 in the years 2001 and 2002 than the President's budget that we \nvoted on last week.\n  Specifically, over those 2 years the Republican budget currently \nexceeds the President's budget in the following areas: Low-income \nhousing, $4.26 billion more; refugee and entrant assistance, $189 \nmillion more; child care and development block grants, $330 million, \nthe WIC program, over $1 billion more, and the Commodity Assistance \nProgram, $66 million more.\n  In other words, even after the amendment we would plan to bring \ntomorrow is adopted, the Republican budget will still provide more \nfunding for these programs within the 600 function than the budget that \nthe President has offered. At the same time, it would give us the \nability to fully fund the violent crime trust fund.\n  So at this point I conclude my remarks in that I must become the \nPresiding Officer here. I will be yielding time to the Senator from \nGeorgia so that he might make further comment on this. At this point I \ncall upon him.\n  Mr. EXON addressed the chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, may I ask how much time the Senator from \nGeorgia will need? We have had several speakers. We generally go back \nand forth. How much time does the Senator wish?\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. If the Senator from Delaware would like to go ahead, I \nthink actually the Senator from Georgia will take over this seat so he \ncan take it upon himself.\n  Mr. EXON. With that understanding, I am pleased to yield 3 minutes at \nthis time to the Senator from Delaware. I believe under the rules he \nwill be talking on an amendment, so the time should be charged on the \namendment, which takes it jointly off of each side's time.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I thank the manager. I was going to respond \nvery, very briefly to the Senator from Michigan who just spoke about \nthe violent crime trust fund. As the author of that trust fund, I am \nsaying I am delighted to see so many Republicans coming aboard now, \nhaving voted against the establishment of that fund.\n  I agree what the House did was outrageous and the proposals to cut \nthe violent crime trust fund are equally outrageous. I want to point \nout, I want to remind everybody how we funded that. The Senator from \nTexas, Senator Gramm, was a cosponsor of the funding of that. We cut it \nby agreeing to do what none of the previous Presidents had done, cut \nthe Federal work force by 272,000 people: No new taxes. No new taxes. \nWe funded it for 6 years.\n  Now I welcome the support for the trust fund and the recognition of \nthe need for it, the recognition it may make sense to extend it beyond \nthe 6 years for which we authorized it. The fact of the matter is, when \nI introduced that legislation and it was passed with six Republican \nvotes--excuse my reference to partisanship here, but I find everybody \nis cutting the COPS program, they come and cut the prevention programs, \nthere are fights on the floor here under the Republican leadership to \ncut the violence-against-women legislation--now I have Republican \nleadership talking about not only liking the trust fund but wanting to \nextend it another 2 years. I think that is a very worthwhile thing to \ndo.\n\n  I hope, if there is a genuine intent to do that, we will first make \nsure you all sign on and we are not going to cut the trust fund now. We \ndid not fully fund the crime bill trust fund, which is now the crime \nlaw trust fund, last year to the extent that there was money in the \ntrust fund in 1996. The House did not fully fund the trust fund this \nyear. We did not and are not fully funding it. The money is there. We \nare not spending any money that had not had the nickel dropped in the \nbox. You take a worker's paycheck who no longer works for the Federal \nGovernment and you put it in the box and you hire a cop, you build a \nprison cell, you go out and deal with a serious prevention program like \nthe drug courts, you go out and make sure you build more boys clubs and \ngirls clubs.\n  So, I hope we are all singing from the same page here and that is \nthat, A, by definition, the crime bill must be pretty good if we are \nextending the trust fund; B, if we are going to extend the trust fund \nanother 2 years we should spend all that is in the trust fund for its \nstated purposes; and, C, I hope we are not going to decide we are going \nto keep kids out of crime, and trouble, and the drug stream by taking \naway the WIC program or taking away other programs to fund the COPS. \nThere are better ways to do it.\n  But I am anxious and willing and delighted that there is the support \nfor the full funding of the trust fund and the extension of the trust \nfund.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Abraham). The Senator from Georgia is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, as the manager I yield myself 3 minutes \nto support the statement you made, Mr. President, and the amendment to \nbe offered tomorrow. I appreciate it, understanding the history of this \nfrom the Senator from Delaware. My support for his amendment is based \nin conjunction with setting of priorities. When we passed the crime \nbill we were told we were going to put 100,000 police officers on the \nstreet. Then, on May 12, 1996, George Stephanopoulos of the White House \nclaimed under this COPS Program it would not be 100,000 police \nofficers, it would be 43,000 police officers. And then on Thursday, May \n16 --that is just several days ago--the Attorney General, Janet Reno, \nstated, ``What I am advised is there are 17,000 officers that can be \nidentified as being on the streets,'' as a result of the COPS Program. \nSo, from 100,000 to 43,000 now we are down to 17,000 officers.\n  I think it is appropriate that if it is less than 20 percent of what \nis promised we ought to adjust the appropriation for that program, \nwhich is of course what your amendment does, Mr. President.\n  In reviewing the COPS officials efforts in their expenditures, I find \nthey rented a 10-floor, 51,000 square foot office building to \nadminister the program at a cost of $1.5 million a year. I would rather \nreinforce the priorities that were just enumerated by the Senator from \nDelaware than this typical Washington bureaucracy.\n  They have five full-time Washington public relations specialists. \nWhat are they there for? Do we need public relations specialists to \ndeal with putting cops on the street? The answer is no.\n  In the 1995 budget, this program spent $10 million on administrative \ncosts alone, funding 130 positions. Meanwhile the administration \nreduced by 100 positions the drug czar's office and only recently has \nindicated that would be repaired.\n  For fiscal year 1996 this program proposed to double--double the \nnumber of administrative officers to 310 positions. Management and \nadministration would reach over $29 million by fiscal year 1997, under \nthe President's proposal.\n  So, what we have here is a program that was much touted that would \nput 100,000 cops on the street; Then we said no, it is only 43,000, but \nthe Justice Department verified that less than 20 percent, only 17 \npercent of that program has been fulfilled. The reason is, it is bait \nand switch. It gets the community into the program but then after 3 \nyears the community is stuck with the bill.\n  In the meantime, the administrative support of the program has it as \nif we had the whole shebang out on the\n\n[[Page S5430]]\n\nstreet. So it is time to scale back these administrative positions, \nthis 10-story building, this 51,000 square feet, and get the \nadministration down to the level commensurate with the actual product \nthat this program has produced.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent--and I will not do \nthis again to my friend--that I have 3 more minutes.\n  Mr. EXON. I yield 3 minutes to the Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. BIDEN. My friend from Georgia has his facts wrong, with all due \nrespect. What the administration said was, we have already funded, of \nthe 100,000 cops, 43,000 to date. When the Republicans were telling us \nwe would not get 20,000, remember Charlton Heston, ``Moses,'' was on TV \nsaying this is only 20,000 cops from the entire 6 years of the program.\n  We have already funded--who being recruited, being hired and being \ntrained--43,000 cops already. Already. And because of the Biden crime \nbill, there are 17,000 of these 43,000 cops on the streets as we speak, \nwith the remaining 26,000 having been funded and in the process of \nbeing recruited, hired and trained.\n  Now, in terms of administrative costs, I challenge any of my \nRepublican friends to pick up the phone and call any one of their local \npolice agencies and ask them about the bureaucratic morass in cost. We \ninsisted this get down to a one-page application. All the cops need do \nis send in a one-page application. It has been the most stunningly \nsuccessful nonbureaucratic program that has been around in the last 20 \nyears.\n  No. 2, cost, administrative costs, 10-story building, whatever that \nwas about. The 100,000 cops has administrative costs of just over 1 \npercent, just over 1 percent administrative cost for putting 100,000 \ncops on the street over the duration of the bill, which takes 6 years.\n  My Republican friends have come along with this brilliant idea of a \nblock grant. You know what they factor in for the block grant? Three \npercent overhead. The 100,000 cops program is one-third or one-half \nbelow what the Republican proposal calls for in the block grant \nproposal. It is actually less than the block grant. This is, with all \ndue respect, poppycock.\n  Folks, nobody thought a year after this program was underway we would \nhave it going, the administration--any administration--would have it \ngoing as well as it is: 17,000 cops making arrests as we speak because \nof Federal funding for cops that did not exist a year and a half ago; \nat total of 43,000 funded being recruited, being hired and being \ntrained as a consequence of the crime bill right now. Right now. We \nhave not gotten to 100,000 yet. No one said that. It was always said it \nwould take the duration of time to get to the full 100,000.\n  The last thing, in 3 years they are going to have to pay their own \nway--\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. BIDEN. I will be happy to.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. I do not want to get into extended debate.\n  Mr. BIDEN. I would love to.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. I do want to read the quote:\n\n       Next week, 43,000 of the 100,000 cops will be on the \n     street.\n\n  That is the quote.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, in response, that is Mr. Stephanopoulos, \nwho knows about one-fiftieth of this as I do. He is not the Attorney \nGeneral; he is not anyone. He makes mistakes on occasion. What he meant \nto say, I am sure, is 43,000 funded and being recruited, being hired. \nYou get recruited and hired before you go into training. You are not on \nthe street yet.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator from Delaware has \nexpired.\n  Mr. BIDEN. I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum and \nask that it be charged equally.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The clerk \nwill call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. EXON. I yield 3 minutes to the Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, referring again to the Record made back \nin 1975. The Parliamentarian points out the fact that Senator Muskie \ncalled it the reconciliation bill in that 1975 discourse. The truth of \nthe matter is Senator Hartke raised that point.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum while I search for \nthe particular quote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I just reviewed the particular statement by Senator \nMuskie back in 1975. As I alluded in my original remarks, Senator \nHartke of Indiana said, ``Where do you get that this is a \nreconciliation bill? There is no reference.'' Senator Muskie said, \n``That is what Senator Long called it.'' He said, ``Just by calling it \nthat, does it make it a reconciliation bill?''\n  I was going to read the exact quote, but I think the full Record \nshould be included here at this point with respect to that special act \nin 1975. It is used as the authority that was a reconciliation bill. It \nresponded to the second concurrent resolution.\n  You read that Record. Mr. Muskie came on the floor at that particular \ntime. He was catching up with what Chairman Long of Finance was doing \nand was trying to justify it. But the truth of the matter is, the \nRecord will clearly show that the tax bill was only in response to the \nsecond concurrent budget resolution and not any reconciliation \ninstructions. That was brought out by Senator Hartke. The exact \ndiscourse will be included in the Record. I had it here.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that it be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n             [From the Congressional Record, Dec. 15, 1975]\n\n       Mr. Muskie. Mr. President, I think this might be a good \n     point, with somewhat of a lag in floor discussion, to discuss \n     the pending legislation, as chairman of the Budget Committee. \n     I shall speak briefly of the relationship of the tax \n     reductions contained in H.R. 5559 and the requirements of the \n     congressional budget process.\n       The second concurrent budget resolution for fiscal year \n     1976, which is now binding upon Congress, provides for \n     extension of the temporary antirecession tax cuts of 1975 at \n     a level which will maintain current tax withholding rates \n     until the end of June 1976. The resolution mandated the \n     Finance and Ways and Means Committees to report such \n     legislation--specifically, legislation which would decrease \n     fiscal year 1976 revenues by approximately $6.4 billion less \n     than what they would be under existing law. H.R. 5559 meets \n     this standard.\n       Extension through June 30, 1976, of the temporary lower \n     withholding rates established last spring will allow adequate \n     time for Congress carefully to develop budget targets for \n     fiscal year 1977 including an overall spending ceiling and \n     revenue floor. These targets will be established in the first \n     concurrent resolution to be adopted by Congress next May. \n     This schedule will allow Congress to establish reasoned and \n     accurate fiscal year 1977 spending and revenue decisions at \n     the first available opportunity under the new congressional \n     budget discipline. If Congress determines at that time to \n     further extend or alter the original 1975 tax reductions, \n     legislation to implement that decision can be enacted before \n     the June 30, 1976, expiration date.\n       I would also like to take this opportunity to praise the \n     Finance Committee, and particularly its chairman, the \n     distinguished Senator from Louisiana, Senator Long, for so \n     closely integrating the vital work of the Finance Committee \n     into the framework of the new congressional budget process. \n     Decisions affecting Government revenue levels are vital both \n     to eliminating future budget deficits and to maintaining the \n     momentum toward economic recovery. Thus, the close \n     coordination of the tax writing committees with the budget \n     process is essential if the process is to be successful.\n\n[[Page S5431]]\n\n       The fact that H.R. 5559, as reported by the Finance \n     Committee, meets the reconciliation instruction in the second \n     concurrent budget resolution is proof of the commitment of \n     the Finance Committee to the successful working of the new \n     budget process.\n       Since H.R. 5559 constitutes the first so-called \n     reconciliation bill required to be reported in the Senate \n     under the Budget Act, I would also like to explain very \n     briefly how reconciliation bills fit into the overall budget \n     process.\n       In recent months, I periodically informed the Senate as to \n     the consistency of various bills with the budget targets \n     established by the first concurrent resolution last spring. \n     Subsequently, the second concurrent budget resolution has \n     just been adopted which establishes binding overall revenue, \n     spending, and debt figures for fiscal year 1976.\n       The Budget Act provides a special procedure to insure rapid \n     enactment of legislation to bring current congressional \n     legislative programs into line with the figures established \n     in the second concurrent resolution. This legislation--which \n     can affect spending authority, budget authority, revenues, or \n     the public debt limit--is known as a reconciliation bill. \n     After enactment of the reconciliation legislation, the focus \n     of the budget process will shift to insuring that subsequent \n     legislation does not breach the second resolution figures.\n       The Budget Act provides that legislation subsequent to a \n     reconciliation bill will be subject to a point of order if it \n     causes either expenditures to exceed the relevant spending \n     ceilings or revenues to fall below the revenue floor \n     established in the second concurrent resolution.\n       With respect to reconciliation bills affecting either \n     spending or revenues, the Budget Act requires they fully \n     carry out the reconciliation instructions given in the second \n     concurrent resolution. The act further provides that no \n     amendment not germane to the provisions of that \n     reconciliation bill is in order.\n       Therefore, in the case of the present second resolution \n     requirement that fiscal year 1976 revenues be reduced by \n     approximately $6.4 billion, amendments to the reconciliation \n     bill which would further reduce revenues more than $6.4 \n     billion or raise revenues above the $300.8 billion set as the \n     appropriate revenue floor for fiscal year 1976 would be out \n     of order.\n       The Budget Committee looks forward to working with the \n     Finance Committee in enforcing the revenue floor and spending \n     ceilings after this legislation is adopted.\n       May I make the point that this is the point at which we \n     move beyond persuasion, which has worked very effectively and \n     to my satisfaction, up to this point, to the discipline of a \n     point of order.\n       Mr. Hartke. Mr. President, will the Senator yield?\n       Mr. Muskie. Yes, I yield to my good friend.\n       Mr. Hartke. How does this bill, which is the pending \n     business, become a reconciliation bill without being \n     designated a reconciliation bill?\n       Mr. Muskie. I think that when we see an apple that looks \n     like an apple, we call it an apple.\n       Mr. Hartke. How can we say this bill is the specific \n     reconciliation bill?\n       Mr. Muskie. If it is not that, then it is out of order, as \n     to cutting revenues.\n       In the first place, I understand the manager of the bill \n     has described it as a reconciliation bill. But beyond that, \n     the only revenue cut that is permitted under the second \n     concurrent resolution is a cut of $6.4 billion. If this bill \n     is not the instrument for achieving that cut, the assumption \n     would have to be, I guess, that a bill is coming along that \n     would. In that case, this bill, being extraneous to that, \n     could be held to be out of order. But I think that is a \n     semantic discussion. We do not mandate the words. All we \n     do is mandate the action.\n       When I say ``we,'' I am talking about Congress as a whole.\n       Mr. Hartke. In other words, the chairman of the Committee \n     on the Budget has made an assumption that this is a \n     reconciliation bill.\n       Mr. Muskie. No, may I say, the chairman of the Committee on \n     Finance has told me it is a reconciliation bill.\n       Mr. Hartke. The chairman of the Finance Committee can make \n     a statement, but that does not make it the situation. The \n     Committee on Finance has not acted upon this being a \n     reconciliation bill. There is no record of its being a \n     reconciliation bill; there is no mention of it in the report \n     as being a reconciliation bill. Therefore, I think a point of \n     order would not be well taken in regard to any amendment, \n     because it is not a reconciliation bill. This is a tax \n     reduction bill.\n       I can see where the Senator may assume, but it is an \n     assumption which is not based on a fact.\n       Mr. Muskie. May I make my point as simply as possible? The \n     second resolution does not permit tax reductions beyond $6.4 \n     billion. If the Senator chooses to say that the proposed tax \n     reduction does not come in a legislative vehicle that could \n     properly be described as a reconciliation bill, still, in my \n     judgment, he cannot escape the point that if it is not that, \n     it is, nevertheless, out of order if it exceeds $6.4 billion.\n       I really do not know why the Senator is chasing his own \n     tail.\n       Mr. Hartke. I am not chasing my tail. I will point out, \n     very simply, that in my judgment, this is a case where two \n     Senators have gotten together and agreed that this is \n     reconciliation bill and there is nothing in the record to \n     show that it is a reconciliation bill.\n       Mr. Muskie. May I say to the Senator, I have never \n     discussed this with Senator Long. If the Senator says I have \n     gotten together with him, the only way in which we have \n     gotten together is that the second concurrent resolution \n     mandates a tax reduction of $6.4 billion and the chairman of \n     the Committee on Finance has reported a bill which reduces \n     revenues approximately $6.4 billion. In that open and \n     nonconspiratorial way have the Committee on Finance and the \n     Committee on the Budget ``gotten together,'' in the words of \n     the Senator.\n       Mr. Hartke. Let us avoid any conspiracy, but the fact is \n     that I think there are not very many, if any, Senators on \n     this floor that had the idea that this bill would not be \n     subject to amendment, other than the fact that there was a \n     unanimous-consent agreement, which is an entirely different \n     proposition. The germaneness rule only comes into effect if \n     this is a reconciliation bill.\n       Mr. Muskie. Why does the Senator not test the point? He is \n     not going to persuade me of it.\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. EXON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4025\n\n (Purpose: To express the sense of the Senate regarding the funding of \n                                Amtrak)\n\n  Mr. EXON. On behalf of Senator Roth, with myself as a cosponsor, I \nsend an amendment to the desk and ask that it be considered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Nebraska [Mr. Exon] for Mr. Roth, for \n     himself and Mr. Exon, proposes an amendment numbered 4025.\n\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that further reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place insert the following:\n\n     SEC.   . SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING THE FUNDING OF AMTRAK.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds that--\n       (1) a capital funding stream is essential to the ability of \n     the National Rail Passenger Corporation (``Amtrak'') to \n     reduce its dependence on Federal operating support; and\n       (2) Amtrak needs a secure source of financing, no less \n     favorable than provided to other modes of transportation, for \n     capital improvements.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that--\n       (1) revenues attributable to one-half cent per gallon of \n     the excise taxes imposed on gasoline, special motor fuel, and \n     diesel fuel from the Mass Transit Account should be dedicated \n     to a new Intercity Passenger Rail Trust Fund during the \n     period January 1, 1997, through September 30, 2001;\n       (2) revenues would not be deposited in the Intercity \n     Passenger Rail Trust Fund during any fiscal year to the \n     extent that the deposit is estimated to result in available \n     revenues in the Mass Transit Account being insufficient to \n     satisfy that year's estimated appropriation levels;\n       (3) monies in the Intercity Passenger Rail Trust Fund \n     should be generally available to fund, on a reimbursement \n     basis, capital expenditures incurred by Amtrak; and\n       (4) amounts to fund capital expenditures related to rail \n     operations should be set aside for each State that has not \n     had Amtrak service in such State for the preceding year.\n\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I rise to offer a sense-of-the-Senate \nregarding funding for Amtrak. My amendment has a very simple and \nimportant purpose. It states that Congress should establish a secure \nsource of financing, no less favorable than that provided to other \ntransportation modes, for capital improvements to intercity passenger \nrail.\n  Recognizing Amtrak's severe needs for capital investment, I have \nintroduced a bill, S. 1395, that would give Amtrak a dedicated source \nof funding. This legislation has already been approved by both the \nSenate Finance Committee and the Senate Commerce Committee. The \nlegislation creates a new intercity passenger rail trust fund which \nwould be funded by transferring revenues from the one-half cent excise \ntax that is currently going into the mass transit account. If this \nlegislation is enacted, Amtrak would be able to use $2.8 billion over 5 \nyears for capital improvements, and States that do not have Amtrak \nservice would be able to fund capital expenditures related to rail \noperations.\n  Some of my colleagues have argued that taking one-half cent from the \nmass transit account would hurt the viability of this account. I would \nlike\n\n[[Page S5432]]\n\nto clarify that the establishment of the intercity passenger rail trust \nfund would not have an adverse impact on mass transit or any other \nmodes of transportation. There is currently a large unspent balance in \nthe mass transit account, totaling about $10 billion. My legislation \nwould only cost $2.8 billion over five. To ensure that the mass transit \naccount would not be adversely affected by transferring the one-half \ncent, the bill provides that Amtrak would be prevented from receiving \nany funds from the rail trust fund if the balance in the mass transit \naccount is insufficient to cover transit spending for the current and \nfollowing fiscal years. Current projections indicate that this would \nnot occur over the 5-year life of the rail trust fund.\n  Mr. Chairman, we are all working toward an Amtrak which operates \nwithout a Federal operating subsidy, which provides quality service, \nand which is financially stable. Amtrak now covers approximately 80 \npercent of its operating costs with self-generated revenue, up from \njust 48 percent in 1981. Yet we also know that no intercity rail \npassenger service anywhere in the world operates without some degree of \npublic sector financial support.\n  Mr. Chairman, if Amtrak is to stay alive and become economically \nhealthy, there is no doubt that it will need the labor and management \nreforms contained in the Amtrak authorization bill which I know \nSenators Lott and Pressler and other Members hope to see enacted this \nyear. Amtrak will need to continue to do its own internal \nrestructuring. It will also need a dedicated trust fund to support \ncapital needs in the same way we provide capital for highways and \nairports.\n  Investment in all modes of transportation is important, but we have \ngone about it in a lop-sided way. Purchasing power for Federal highway \nprograms has increased by 48 percent from 1982 to 1996. It has \nincreased 78 percent for aviation, but has decreased 46 percent for \npassenger rail. In fact, Amtrak currently receives less than 3 percent \nof all Federal transportation spending. To attain balance, we must \nbalance our financial support to all transportation components, \nincluding passenger rail service.\n  As I have stated before, a secure source of capital funding is \nnecessary for Amtrak's future economic health. New capital investments \nwill allow Amtrak to operate more efficiently. With new equipment, \nAmtrak will attract substantial new ridership--bringing with it \nincreased revenues and allowing Amtrak to eliminate its dependence on \nFederal operating subsidies. It currently costs Amtrak $60 million per \nyear to operate and maintain its old equipment, which frequently breaks \ndown and often requires parts to be specially made.\n  As a Senator living along the Northeast corridor, I cannot stress how \nimportant it is that we have intercity rail service. Depending on the \nSenate schedule, I ride the train almost daily between Wilmington and \nWashington. Without Amtrak, I would not be able to live in Wilmington \nand work in Washington.\n  Here in the Northeast, Amtrak is the dominant public carrier, with \nmore than 10 million riders a year. Between Washington and New York it \ntakes care of 43 percent of the combined air/rail passenger market. The \nneed for rail service is also growing in other parts of America. For \nexample, Amtrak service between San Diego and Los Angeles serves two \nmillion people. Routes also are growing between New York and Boston; \nChicago, Milwaukee, St. Louis, and Detroit; and between Portland and \nSeattle. In fact, many of our rural communities are almost completely \ndependent on Amtrak for their transportation needs.\n  As someone concerned not only about the environment, but about \ntraffic congestion, especially in the Northeast, where we lack the \nlands and resources for new roads, I am a proponent of Amtrak.\n  Simply put, Amtrak is safe, fuel efficient, speedy and the best \ntransportation alternative for millions of Americans. It's $2.2 billion \nbudget directly generates some 25,000 jobs nationwide, and more than \nthan 33 million Americans across the country commute to work on Amtrak-\noperated systems throughout the country. I am grateful for the service \nAmtrak provides me and the thousands of men and women who depend every \nday on Amtrak.\n  If Congress hopes to privatize Amtrak in the next 5 years, and if we \nsupport continued intercity passenger rail service--service that is \nvital to both rural and urban areas--we must vote for a dedicated trust \nfund for Amtrak.\n  Mr. President, thank you and I yield the floor.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to this sense-of-\nthe-Senate resolution offered by the Senator from Delaware that would \nallow Amtrak to invade the highway trust fund for its financial wants.\n  Under this plan, Amtrak would divert one-half cent per gallon of the \nhighway automobile fuel tax, from the mass transit account of the \nhighway trust fund, and into a new trust fund designed to benefit \nAmtrak trains. By voting for this resolution, Senators would vote to \nclassify much of this entirely new spending from this new trust fund as \ndirect spending under the Budget Enforcement Act. Thus, this sense-of-\nthe-Senate resolution resolves the Senate to both plunder the highway \ntrust fund and create a new entitlement. Now is not the time to create \nnew entitlements; now is the time to show our sincerity in balancing \nthe Federal budget.\n  Mr. President, Senators should vote against this Amtrak resolution \nbecause it steals much needed capitol funds from our country's mass \ntransit systems. And let me remind my colleagues that Amtrak is not the \nsame as your local mass transit system. Both may carry significant \nnumbers of passengers when compared to the private automobile, but the \nsimilarities end there and the differences begin. Local mass transit \ncarries the working poor, disabled and the elderly to jobs, to local \nclothing and grocery stores, to medical services, and other amenities \nof the local community. These are people who do not have access to \nother modes of transportation and are highly dependent on the local \nmass transit system. Mass transit carries more people in 1 day than \nAmtrak carries in 1 year.\n  Let me also remind my colleagues that 60 percent of the cuts made in \nthe fiscal year 1996 transportation appropriations came from mass \ntransit.\n  Amtrak, on the other hand, has a very different ridership. A study \nstates that ``travel on Amtrak by persons with incomes above $40,000 is \n3.5 times higher than intercity buses and nearly 1.5 times higher than \nairlines.'' This is not the working poor trying to get to their job, or \nthe elderly to medical care. It is all well and good to buy new scenic \ncruisers and build train stations in New York, but not at the expense \nof getting people to their jobs, or to the doctor.\n  Mr. President, on May 6 the White House issued a statement of \nadministration policy on S. 1318, which reauthorized Amtrak. I as \nunanimous consent that that statement be entered into the Record after \nmy remarks. It is clear from that statement that the administration has \ndeep concerns about changing Amtrak's funding. In that statement the \nOffice of Management and Budget ``strongly opposes'' providing Amtrak \nappropriated funds on an accelerated basis, fearing that this ``would \nunnecessarily increase Federal borrowing costs.'' They also oppose \n``subordinating the Federal interest as a creditor in the event of a \ndefault under the section 511 loan program'' and the proposed Federal \nguarantee of new borrowing authority for Amtrak authorized in this \nlegislation.\n  I have to ask my friend from Delaware if he intends to create a new \ntax to subsidize Amtrak as a follow-up to his sense-of-the-Senate \nresolution?\n  I ask this because my reading of the amendment is that revenues taken \nfrom the highway trust fund and re-routed to Amtrak shall be re-routed \nbetween the period of January 1, 1997, through September 30, 2001.\n  However, my reading of the Tax Code (Sec. 9503, 1996 Cumulative \nAnnual Pocket Part, West Publishing Company, 1996.) tells me that the \nfuel tax for the highway trust fund expires on September 30, 1999. \nThus, under current law there will be no revenues for 2 full years of \nthis subsidy, if this subsidy were law. Indeed, under current law, the \nonly automobile fuel tax that will survive after September 30, 1999, is \nPresident Clinton's 1993 4.3-cent-per-gallon fuel\n\n[[Page S5433]]\n\ntax increase for the general fund that so many of my colleagues in the \nSenate oppose.\n  Therefore, I again would like to ask my friend from Delaware if he \nintends to increase highway taxes in the future, and is this the first \nstep toward that tax increase?\n  If Amtrak needs the Senate to sustain or increase a tax, then I \nespecially urge all of my colleagues who oppose tax increases to \nconsistently oppose this Amtrak sense of the Senate because, like all \nother tax increases, it will hit the pocketbooks of taxpaying \nAmericans.\n  Senators should vote against this Amtrak train invasion of the \nhighway trust fund because this proposed new Amtrak trust fund \ncontradicts any efforts to balance the budget. Senate bill No. 1395 \noutlines the plan for the new Amtrak trust fund. That bill legislates \ndirect spending from the highway trust fund, through the new Amtrak \ntrust fund, and into Amtrak. I believe that Congress should not now be \ncreating a new and special entitlement for Amtrak while at the same \ntime we are reducing the growth of other more important entitlements \nthat affect many more Americans. We in the Senate are in an historic \nand difficult process of offering this Nation a balanced budget. If \nthis budget succeeds, it will be the first balanced budget enacted \nsince 1969. While attempting to achieve a balanced budget plan for \nfiscal 1996, many in Congress have already made painful sacrifices. The \nbudget resolution for 1997 requires that many of us repeat those same \nsacrifices. Given the choice, Mr. President, many of us might rather \nspend the necessary revenue offsets to increase funding for Medicare or \nMedicaid or for the protection of the environment. Therefore, it is \ninappropriate that Congress would at this same time create a new \nentitlement for Amtrak.\n  Mr. President, this Amtrak resolution further cuts against a balanced \nbudget because it is new spending. As the second most senior Republican \nMember of the Senate Budget Committee, I am here to remind everyone \nthat the highway trust funds are on the budget. Though there is a \nseparate account for the highway trust funds, there is no separate \nbook. Any new and additional spending for Amtrak is to feed yet another \nhungry mouth, and yet another break in our fiscal dam. Therefore, in \nour budget balancing efforts, funding Amtrak from an existing source \nstill requires that the Senate either raise someone else's taxes, or \ncut someone else's spending without a thorough review. I am against \nboth. I want to balance the budget.\n  Additionally, I will say that though this sense-of-the-Senate \nresolution regards a revenue bill, the Senate Committee on Finance has \nheld no hearings on the underlying bill, nor has it held a general \nhearing on the Amtrak train's invasion of the automobile driver's \nhighway trust fund moneys.\n  In summary, Mr. President, a vote in favor of this Amtrak sense of \nthe Senate is a vote against highways and against automobile drivers. \nIt is a vote in favor of corporate welfare and against Medicare and \nMedicaid beneficiaries. Indeed, this sense-of-the-Senate resolution for \nAmtrak is a vote against a balanced budget.\n  I encourage all of my colleagues to join me in voting ``no'' on this \nresolution to bail out Amtrak by invading the automobile driver's \nhighway trust fund and creating new spending.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a statement of \nadministration policy be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the statement was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                   Statement of Administration Policy\n\n\n           S. 1318--Amtrak and Local Rail Revitalization Act\n\n       The Administration agrees with the thrust of S. 1318, to \n     enable Amtrak to respond to consumer needs and market \n     realities and to free itself from Federal subsidies. Although \n     S. 1318 includes many provisions to that end, some of its \n     provisions could impede achievement of these objectives or \n     impose other unnecessary burdens.\n       The Administration is generally opposed to the imposition \n     of arbitrary caps on punitive damage amounts, and would \n     strongly oppose the inclusion of any provision in S. 1318 \n     imposing such caps.\n       The Administration also strongly opposes the requirement \n     that appropriated funds be provided to Amtrak on an \n     accelerated basis. This requirement, which is not necessary \n     to support Amtrak's operations, would shift $659 million of \n     Federal outlays to FY 1996 that would occur, under current \n     law, in FY 1997 and FY 1998. This would unnecessarily \n     increase Federal borrowing costs.\n       In addition, the Administration strongly opposes Senate \n     passage of S. 1318 unless it is amended to:\n       Delete the provisions for a permanent authorization of \n     appropriations for the Local Rail Freight Assistance Program \n     (LRFAP), and modifications to the section 511 loan program. \n     The President did not request, and Congress did not provide, \n     any appropriations for LRFAP for the current fiscal year. The \n     rail freight industry has clearly established its ability to \n     operate without Federal subsidies or loans. Any future \n     decisions to subsidize the rail freight industry should be \n     made by local State governments in the context of their \n     overall transportation planning, not by the Federal \n     Government.\n       Delete the provision which would subordinate the Federal \n     interest as a creditor in the event of a default under the \n     section 511 loan program. Such provisions increase the risk, \n     and therefore the ``subsidy rate,'' of loans guaranteed under \n     this program, thereby reducing the number of loans which \n     could be made with the resources available.\n\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, just briefly, what this amendment is is a \nproposition that we have been talking about for a long time, to provide \nsome funding, badly needed funding, for the Amtrak system. The \namendment speaks for itself. I simply ask for the yeas and nays on the \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There is a \nsufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. EXON. I thank the Chair. I yield the floor.\n  How much time would the Senator from Washington like?\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Two minutes.\n  Mr. EXON. I yield 2 minutes to the Senator from Washington. Is this \non an amendment or another subject?\n  Mrs. MURRAY. On an amendment.\n  Mr. EXON. On an amendment the time would be equally divided. I yield \nthe Senator from Washington 2 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Let me just take this opportunity to also thank the ranking member of \nour Budget Committee, Senator Exon, for the excellent job he has done \nover the past several days managing the budget and being a spokesperson \nfor all of us.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3991\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I rise today to remind all of my \ncolleagues that one of the most important amendments that we are \nconsidering tomorrow is the Kerry-Murray amendment that adds $56 \nbillion to function 500. That is the function in the budget that covers \neducation and the investment in our young people.\n  I wanted to rise today to ask unanimous consent to have printed in \nthe Record articles from the Seattle PI that did a survey that shows \nthe No. 1 issue in my home State is education. I believe this is \nreplicated around the country. In fact, USA Today had a poll recently \nthat said this is the No. 1 issue to voters.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n          [From the Seattle Post-Intelligencer, May 20, 1996]\n\n              Daily Worries Concern Voters Most, Poll Says\n\n\n                 schools, jobs overshadow other issues\n\n                            (By Neil Modie)\n\n       Meat-and-potatoes concerns--taxes, jobs and the economy--\n     loom large in the minds of Washington voters as they look \n     toward this fall's elections. As a single issue, however, \n     education tops them all.\n       A new poll, the Mood of Washington, shows the electorate \n     cares far less about the hot-potato issues--abortion, gun \n     control, gay rights--that apparently heat up political party \n     caucuses, TV screens and news pages more than they do the \n     voting booths.\n       Most voters polled said they feel less safe than they did \n     four years ago. They think the public school system is \n     declining and feel they must struggle harder to maintain \n     their standards of living.\n       When family and pocketbook issues preoccupy people, they \n     show little interest in the hot-button topics, observed Bruce \n     Pinkleton, a public opinion researcher at Washington State \n     University.\n       ``When people are concerned about job security and other, \n     related issues, then some of the other (more emotional) \n     issues become less central to their decision making,'' said \n     Pinkleton; who conducted the poll along with Joey Reagan, a \n     fellow researcher who also works at WSU.\n       Surveyors polled 556 of the state's registered voters \n     between April 24-30 in a collaborative project by The \n     Associated Press\n\n[[Page S5434]]\n\n     and 12 state newspapers, including the Post-Intelligencer, \n     the Olympian, the Tacoma News Tribune, the Herald in Everett \n     and the Sun in Bremerton.\n       Worry about the state of public schools is widespread. \n     Nearly six in 10 voters polled believe public education is \n     worse than it was four years ago. And a slightly higher \n     number agreed that the education in Washington is \n     underfunded.\n       I think education should get a better slice of the budget \n     pie and I would be willing to pay more taxes (to pay for \n     it),'' Judith Jenkins Harlin, a poll respondent from Redmond, \n     said in a interview. She is a homemaker, mother and school \n     volunteer who has been trained as a teacher.\n       Cricket Hamilton, an Olympia search-and-rescue officer, \n     also thinks schools are in trouble but is unwilling to pay \n     more taxes to let educators spend more money.\n       ``Definitely not,'' Hamilton said. ``reading, writing, and \n     arithmetic has to be brought back, not pottery.''\n       Pinkleton, the researcher, observed: ``A lot of people feel \n     that education is underfunded, a big majority, and yet people \n     aren't terribly excited about paying more taxes, either. So \n     we kind of want to have our cake and eat it, too.''\n       The poll didn't specifically ask voters whether they would \n     be wiling to pay higher taxes to support education. But it \n     did affirm Washingtonians' long-standing opposition to a \n     state income tax.\n       Asked if they ``would support a state-income tax if state \n     taxes would be cut in other areas,'' 56 percent said no. \n     Barely more than one-third replied favorably. The rest had no \n     opinion.\n       When asked how important they consider education in \n     deciding which candidate to vote for, nearly nine voters in \n     10 ranked important by more than three-fourths of the votes. \n     Then came welfare reform, the candidate's moral character, a \n     candidate's ability to work with political opponents, the \n     environment, and illegal immigration, in that order, with \n     each rated important by more than half those polled.\n       At the bottom were gun control, important to barely half \n     the voters; abortion, mentioned by two out of five, and gay \n     rights, cited by just over one-fourth of those polled. The \n     voters weren't asked on which side of those issues they \n     stood.\n       When the voters were asked, without mention of any specific \n     issue, to identify the most important concerns in this fall's \n     gubernatorial election, education again was the most-often \n     mentioned single concern, even above such perennial worries \n     as the economy, taxes and crime.\n       However, although 125 voters named education, even more--\n     191--said, ``I don't know.''\n       That surprised Pinkleton.\n       ``Clearly, issues are still developing in the minds of the \n     voters. . . . It's still fairly early (in the campaign \n     season),'' the researcher observed.\n       After education, mention of other issues dropped off \n     steeply. Ranked below education, in order of the number of \n     times they were mentioned, were taxes, environment and \n     conservation, crime and law enforcement state spending and \n     the budget, the economy, health care and unemployment and \n     jobs.\n       Other issues, including welfare reform, moral issues, gay \n     rights and prayer ranked far lower. None of the 556 voters \n     mentioned such volatile topics as abortion or gun rights.\n       The responses suggested that voters trust their state \n     government more than they trust their fellow citizens.\n       Asked whether they agree that ``voters usually make \n     informed voting decisions,'' only 43 percent did. But 53 \n     percent said they trust state government to ``side with the \n     public interest'' in deciding between public interest and \n     special interests.\n       The poll showed plenty of worry across a range of social \n     ills.\n       Asked whether they agreed with the broad statement that \n     ``deteriorating social values are responsible for today's \n     crime problem,'' nearly eight in 10 said they did.\n       One who emphatically agreed was Vern Dollar, 52, a \n     Vancouver resident, who declared: ``Our social values have \n     decreased. All the neighbors knew one another when we moved \n     in here 28 years ago, and I don't know the new ones who move \n     in. . . . There's an influx of California people and they \n     aren't very sociable, Good neighbors help neighbors.''\n       Despite the worry about declining social values, one \n     finding of the poll might surprise Washingtonians aware of \n     the Pacific Northwest's long-held reputation--bemoaned by the \n     Rev. Billy Graham, among others--as something of a religious \n     wasteland.\n       Asked whether they agreed with the statement that \n     ``religious values play a role in my everyday \n     decisions,''nearly two voters out of three did agree.\n       Religion plays the strongest role in the lives of the \n     oldest voters, with more than seven out of 10 of those age 62 \n     and older saying it did. But nearly six in 10 voters in the \n     least religious age group, those 18 to 39, said religious \n     values were part of their lives.\n       Conservative voters were most apt to say religion is part \n     of their lives, and the most liberal voters were the least \n     likely.\n       The poll revealed deep concerns across a broad topical \n     spectrum. For example:\n\n\n                                 crime\n\n       Nearly two out of three agreed they feel less safe then \n     four years ago, and nearly four in five favor stronger \n     penalties for criminals.\n       That tough stance applied to youthful criminals, too. Asked \n     whether they agreed with the statement that ``criminals under \n     18 should be exempt from the death penalty,'' six in 10 \n     disagreed. Even a majority of voters who identified \n     themselves as politically ``liberal'' disagreed that \n     criminals under 18 should be exempt. However, four-fifths of \n     voters labeling themselves ``very liberal'' said criminals \n     that young should be exempt.\n       Men were less in favor of exempting criminals from the \n     death penalty than women were, with 72 percent of men \n     opposing that exemption while only 53 percent of women did.\n       ``Even the death penalty is kind of a joke; it takes years \n     and years,'' remarked Trina Henifin, 22, a Bellingham \n     resident who was polled. ``How did they (carry out the death \n     penalty) way back before there was the appeals system? Do it \n     right away like they did in the old days.''\n       Asked whether ``state government should spend more money \n     building prisons,'' 57 percent disagreed.\n\n\n                            economy and jobs\n\n       Nearly one in four of those surveyed said they were \n     concerned about losing their jobs. The worry was highest \n     among people with less than a high school degree.\n       A majority of voters disagreed with the statement that if \n     they lost their jobs, it would be easy to find jobs with \n     similar pay. The least educated were most likely to be \n     pessimistic.\n       And more than three voters in four agreed with the \n     statement that they have to work harder today to maintain \n     their standard of living than they did four years ago.\n       ``The cost of living is higher, the cost of gas, \n     electricity has gone, up, food too,'' said Gerald Barnett, a \n     Spokane-area machinist and father of two, who first \n     registered to vote last year. ``I work overtime, and that \n     helps, but the more you make, the more they take out in \n     taxes.''\n\n\n                           health and welfare\n\n       Asked whether they agreed that limits should be imposed on \n     the length of time welfare recipients can receive state \n     assistance more than eight voters in 10 said they did. And \n     three-fourths agreed that ``welfare recipients should be \n     forced to work'' if they receive assistance.\n       Without being asked specifically whether state government \n     should pay for health care, just under three-fourths of the \n     voters agreed that ``state make sure that health care is \n     available to everyone.''\n\n\n             environment, property rights and other issues\n\n       Washingtonians were lukewarm about environmental issues in \n     their responses to several queries on the subject.\n       A plurality, 48 percent, disagreed with a statement that \n     ``protecting the environment is more important than \n     protecting jobs''--a choice that most conservationists argue \n     society needn't make--while just under one-third agreed. The \n     rest didn't answer. And a majority of the voters disagreed \n     with a statement that ``government agencies do an acceptable \n     job of balancing land use with environmental protection.''\n       A plurality, 49 percent, agreed that ``public money should \n     be used to pay people when the government restricts how they \n     use their land,'' while 39 percent disagreed.\n       Only one-third of the voters agreed that the state is more \n     racially divided than it was four years ago while nearly half \n     disagreed. More nonwhites than whites--but still less than a \n     majority--believe the state is more divided.\n       A clear majority of voters, 58 percent, said ``acceptance \n     of homosexuals or bisexuals'' should be taught in the public \n     schools.''\n       But support for the teaching of other values was much \n     higher: more than nine voters in 10 favor teaching \n     ``acceptance of people who hold different beliefs'' and \n     teaching ``moral courage;'' nearly as many want \n     ``responsibility to prevent unwanted pregnancy'' taught, and \n     nearly three-fourths support teaching ``sexual abstinence \n     outside marriage.''\n       Many voters seem to yearn for the values they grew up with, \n     values they see as eroded today.\n\n                           *   *   *   *   *\n\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n          [From the Seattle Post-Intelligencer, May 20, 1996]\n\n               Education Rated No. 1 of All State Issues\n\n                            (By Neil Modie)\n\n       The Mood of Washington poll confirms what the state's 1996 \n     political candidates already seem well aware of: Voters are \n     plenty worried about public education.\n       ``There's just a whole different intensity about the issue \n     this year,'' observed Terry Bergeson, executive director of \n     the state Commission on Student Learning and a candidate for \n     superintendent of public instruction.\n       So far in the still-early campaign for governor, most of \n     the 10 major candidates--four Democrats and six Republicans--\n     have been talking more about education than anything else, \n     even such tried-and-true issues as the economy, taxes and \n     crime.\n       That's logical, since public education, including colleges \n     and universities, accounts for nearly 60 percent of the state \n     general fund budget.\n       And candidates who survive the primary will be sharing the \n     general election ballot with two controversial education-\n     related initiatives dealing with school vouchers and charter \n     schools.\n\n[[Page S5435]]\n\n       Whatever the reasons, some of the candidates' and political \n     parties' own polls are showing deep concern about the state's \n     school system, more so than in past years.\n       In the Mood of Washington poll, 88 percent said education \n     was important to them in deciding who to vote for, and four \n     of every five in that group said it was ``very important.'' \n     No other issue rated such a response in the survey.\n       ``That's amazing. That's the highest I've ever seen'' in \n     any poll, Bergeson said.\n       The poll was a collaborative project by The Associated \n     Press and 12 state newspapers, including the Post-\n     Intelligencer, the Olympian, the Tacoma News Tribune, the \n     Herald in Everett and the Sun in Bremerton.\n       Nearly three in five voters polled said the quality of \n     public education is worse today than it was four years ago. \n     That view was strongest among the youngest and least educated \n     voters--those in the 18-to-39 age group and with less than a \n     high school education--as well as among the most politically \n     conservative voters.\n       Slightly more than three out of five voters, and especially \n     the youngest and the most politically liberal voters, said \n     education is underfunded.\n       When voters were asked to name the most important issues in \n     the gubernatorial election, education was mentioned most \n     often--by a long shot.\n       Cheryl Causey, 49, a Mercer Island mother and a student in \n     interior design, thinks schools have improved ``in the area \n     of critical thinking skills rather than just role learning.''\n       But she is concerned about a lack of classroom discipline \n     and ``a basic `dumbing down' in some areas. I've read some of \n     the textbooks used by my daughter and have found that some of \n     the language used isn't very challenging. It plays down to a \n     lesser intelligence and doesn't encourage the kids to really \n     think and go beyond.''\n       Verna Kloehn, 73, a retired barber and Kennewick resident, \n     thinks kids nowadays are ``damn dumb. They can't assimilate \n     knowledge worth a darn.''\n       Voters' concerns about public schools had to do not only \n     with the quality of education, but also crime and violence.\n       And that was a worry expressed not only in urban areas, but \n     in smaller communities as well.\n       ``We need more teachers, more guards,'' said Trina Henifin, \n     22, a Bellingham resident, ``I think it's terrible you have \n     to have guards in schools, but you do.''\n       Bergeson, who directs a commission created to develop \n     statewide academic standards, surmised that voters might \n     think schools are worse than they were four years ago because \n     ``people are seeing more in the news about violence in \n     schools, about weapons.''\n       ``It doesn't have so much to do with education'' as with \n     safety, she said.\n       Bruce Pinkleton, one of two Washington State University \n     researchers who conducted the Mood of Washington poll, \n     suggested the concern about education might stem largely from \n     the public's tendency ``to look to the educational system to \n     rectify the ills of society.''\n       Judith Jenkins Harlin, a Redmond ``stay-at-home mom'' and \n     school volunteer, agrees.\n       ``I think public education has been asked to do too much, \n     and public education doesn't turn anyone away,'' said Harlin, \n     who is trained as a teacher. ``Teachers in public education \n     are trying to be mother, father, social worker, teacher, \n     legal enforcer--we are asking teachers to do too much.''\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I have taken the time over the last year to talk to \nhundreds of young people in my home State. I have talked to people, \nyoung students who are 4.0 students; I have talked to students in \njuvenile detention centers. The one thing they all say in common is \nthey believe that in this country today, adults do not care about them.\n  Mr. President, we have an opportunity tomorrow to vote for the Kerry-\nMurray amendment to put dollars back into our education account and \nshow our young people they are a priority to us. I can think of no \nbetter investment in this country to invest in the education and \ntraining of our young people.\n  I urge my colleagues to support that amendment. I remind my \ncolleagues, this is a way we can make a difference for this country. I \nyield the floor.\n  Mr. EXON. I thank my friend from Washington for her kind remarks, and \nI thank her for the amendment she has just offered.\n  I yield 2 minutes to the Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, once again, regarding the record and \nthis ruling, I turn to the Congressional Record, the House of \nRepresentatives, H11693, December 3, 1980. I quote Mr. Panetta:\n\n       It obviously is the first time that the reconciliation \n     process itself has been implemented under the Budget Act.\n\n  Further:\n\n       No other chairman in the history of the Budget Committee \n     has been able to say that reconciliation has been implemented \n     and put into place. They have passed budget resolutions. We \n     have passed continuing resolutions of one kind or another, \n     but this is the first time that a chairman of the Budget \n     Committee has implemented the reconciliation process.\n\n  I yield the floor.\n\n  Mr. HEFLIN. Mr. President, I wish to express my support for the \nPresident's fiscal year 1997 budget plan. There is no one here that \nwants a balanced budget more than I do. The largest obstacle to \nsustainable, long-term economic growth is our huge national debt. This \nis why I support the administration's budget. President Clinton is the \nfirst President in 17 years to submit a balanced budget using the \nCongressional Budget Office [CBO] figures, all while protecting \nMedicare, Medicaid, education, the environment, and cutting taxes for \nmiddle-class families.\n  There has been no President with a record of deficit reduction that \ncompares to President Clinton's. Under the President's leadership the \nbudget deficit has been cut more than in half. Four years ago, the \nNation was faced with a budget deficit of $290 billion. The CBO is now \npredicting a budget deficit of only $144 billion for fiscal year 1996. \nAlso, the total spending is lower as a share of the economy than in any \nyear since 1979. This budget continues the highly successful deficit \nreduction of the President's 1993 economic plan and contains billions \nin entitlement savings and discretionary cuts.\n  The President's budget guarantees the life of the Medicare trust fund \nfor a decade without cutting it $167 billion as the Republicans have \nproposed. The Republican plan reduces Medicare by $50 billion more than \nthe President's balanced budget plan. The cuts to Medicare payments \nthat the Republicans propose will result in cost-shifting, undermine \nquality, and threaten the financial viability of many rural and urban \nhospitals. On the other hand, the President's budget restores the pre-\n1980 law on part A home health benefits because home health care \nexpenditures unrelated to hospital stays should not be financed by the \npart A trust fund. This helps extend the life of Medicare part A trust \nfund. In summary, the President's proposal reforms and modernizes the \nprogram, while providing more choices to beneficiaries.\n  While the President's budget has moderate cuts in Medicaid, the $72 \nbillion reduction that the Republicans propose could be drastic. This \n$72 billion cut could total as much as $250 billion over 7 years if \nStates spend only the minimum required to receive their full block \ngrant allocations. Many middle-class families depend on the Medicaid \nguarantee to provide for the care of their parents. If States are \nforced to deny coverage or restrict benefits, this could adversely \naffect millions of Americans that depend on such help that the program \nprovides. Another thing that concerns me about the Republican proposal \nis the insistency of the repeal of Federal enforcement of nursing home \nquality standards. These regulations are important to the families that \nhave to make the tough decision to place a loved one in a nursing home. \nOn the other hand, the President's budget provides the States with \ngreat flexibility in managing their programs while guaranteeing health \ncare for millions of Americans.\n  In order to reach a balanced budget, we all know decisions must be \nmade in an effort to eliminate costs; however, these decisions must be \ncarefully examined. This is particularly true when proposed cuts affect \nthe educational system of our country. The Republicans want to use \nextreme cuts in education to balance the budget, when the President's \nplan shows that they are not necessary. The Republican resolution cuts \neducation and training by $26 billion compared to 1995. The Republican \nplan also provides $60 billion less for education and training than the \nPresident's budget over the next 6 years. The future of our Nation \ndepends greatly on the education that is provided to our children and \nthe training that is available to our work force. The President's \nbudget provides both the funding and policies needed to meet these \nchallenges.\n  The President's budget also provides tax relief for the middle-class \nworking families of America, making it easier for them to pay for \neducation and save for retirement. The President proposes a tax credit \nfor dependent children, a\n\n[[Page S5436]]\n\nbenefit that would affect 19 million families, expanded individual \nretirement accounts [IRA's] to provided greater incentives for savings \nfor retirement, and an education and job training tax deduction that \nwould allow taxpayers to deduct up to $10,000 a year for qualified \neducation and training expenses. The President also proposes other tax \nrelief aimed at small businesses, such as increased expensing, estate \ntax benefits for closely held businesses, pension simplification, and \nincreased health insurance deductions for the self-employed. The \nPresident's budget offsets this much needed tax relief by eliminating \nor reducing corporate tax loopholes and preferences that are no longer \nwarranted.\n  Mr. President, I support the President's budget because this budget \nhas a plan for balancing the budget while protecting Medicare, \nMedicaid, and education, along with providing a modest tax cut for \nmiddle-class Americans.\n\n\n                            regarding ahcpr\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I would like to engage in a brief colloquy \nwith the distinguished chairman of the Budget Committee to discuss an \nassumption that appears on page 52 of our report and clarify the \ncommittee's assumptions regarding the discretionary health programs \ncontained in function 550. The language suggests that the committee is \nassuming a significant reduction in the budget of the Agency for Health \nCare Policy and Research [AHCPR]. I expressed my concerns regarding \nthis matter during the committee's markup of the resolution.\n  Mr. President, I feel strongly about this Agency's mission for two \nreasons. First, as I pointed out during our markup, I believe that the \nAgency for Health Care Policy and Research has gone a long way toward \nreforming itself and has been responsive to the constructive criticism \nit received from Congress over the past year. For example, last year \nthere was debate regarding the wisdom of AHCPR continuing to develop \nclinical practice guidelines now that so many medical societies, health \nplans, and others have begun to develop their own guidelines. AHCPR \ntook this criticism seriously, engaged in a dialog with the health care \ncommunity, and announced last month that it would no longer directly \nsupport the development of clinical practice guidelines. Instead, the \nAgency will work in partnership with the health care community by \nmeeting their needs for an assessment of the scientific evidence in \nclinical areas for which these physicians and health plans--not AHCPR--\nwant to develop guidelines or other quality improvement strategies. \nThis partnership approach is a winner for all: AHCPR will concentrate \non its strengths, developing and assessing science, and physicians and \nhealth plans will have the information they need to develop better, \nevidence-based guidelines without the implication that the Federal \nGovernment is telling them how to practice medicine.\n  Similarly, last year there were concerns about the multitude of \noverlapping data collection activities within the Department of Health \nand Human Services [HIS]. Despite the fact that the AHCPR has only a \nsmall, but important, role in the area of data collection, the Agency \ntook the lead in proposing a major restructuring of its medical \nexpenditure survey to eliminate areas of duplication with other HHS \nsurveys.\n  In both cases, AHCPR has been willing to take a fresh look at its \nactivities and critically examine its role in relationship to the \nprivate sector and other Federal agencies. We should applaud this type \nof initiative and responsiveness, not cripple it.\n  More importantly, Mr. President, I am concerned bout the potential \nimpact on the clinical and health services research that AHCPR \nsupports. Its mission in this area is critical to the future of our \nfast-changing health care system and to our efforts to restructure the \nMedicare program, while ensuring high quality of care. This Agency \nprovides an important compliment to the work of the National Institutes \nof Health through its research on the outcomes, effectiveness, and \ncost-effectiveness of health care services in day-to-day practice. In \nthe last 2 years, this Agency has come to realize its role as a science \npartner with the health care community and, as a result, AHCPR's work \nhas been endorsed by every major medical, nursing, and health care \norganization, from the American Medical Association to the managed care \nindustry. And from personal experience, in my work on the Medicare \nProgram, I can testify that there are few issues on which such \ndisparate organizations agree. AHCPR's scientific work provides \nclinicians and patients with the tools they need to work together to \nimprove the quality of health care while constraining its cost.\n  Mr. President, at this point I would like to yield to the \ndistinguished Chairman and ask him whether he agrees with my \ninterpretation of our budget assumptions and my conclusion that this \nbudget resolution assumes no reduction in funding for the critical work \nof the Agency for Health Care Policy and Research.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I want to thank Senator Frist for his continued efforts \nin this critical policy area. The Chairman's mark of the budget \nresolution did assume a reduction in funding for the Agency for Health \nCare Policy Research [AHCPR]. Funding for AHCPR was assumed to be \nreduced to $46 million per year, beginning in 1997. Since then, I have \nworked with Senator Frist to find alternate assumptions to meet our \ndiscretionary spending targets within function 550. The resolution now \nassumes that funding for AHCPR will not be reduced.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I rise in support of Senate Concurrent \nResolution 57, the balanced budget resolution for fiscal year 1997. I \ncommend the hard work by the Budget Committee to bring to this floor, \none more time, what the American people--and the people of Idaho--have \ndemanded: A genuine, convincing plan to balance the Federal budget by \nfiscal year 2002.\n  This balanced budget resolution is consistent, in its principles and \nits details, with what I believe most citizens in Idaho want.\n  Like most Idahoans, I would prefer to go farther, faster. But I also \nrecognize how far we have come in just a year and a half. In the last \nCongress, dominated by the President's party, we were told that $200 \nbillion a year in deficit spending, as far as the eye could see, was \nthe best we could do.\n  This budget resolution does not represent politics as usual. It looks \nto a brighter future of more jobs, more affordable educations, a more \nsecure Medicare system, and real welfare reform--all within a balanced \nbudget.\n\n\n              Conducting the Balanced Budget Game In Idaho\n\n  Mr. President, to focus in some depth on the budget priorities of \nIdahoans, last month, my office held a series of meetings in five \nlocations in Idaho. We invited folks to participate in an exercise in \nhard choices--or, what I call the balanced budget game.\n  We held these in Idaho Falls, Pocatello, Twin Falls, Nampa, and \nBoise.\n  This exercise has been developed and updated regularly by the \nnonpartisan, nonprofit educational organization, the Committee for a \nResponsible Federal Budget.\n  In this exercise, citizens get the chance to be a Senator for a day--\nmeeting in small groups that work much like the Senate Budget Committee \nduring the markup of the budget resolution and walking through a 180-\npage workbook resembling a Budget Committee markup book.\n  Across the State, participants were grouped into 32 groups, or budget \ncommittees, with between 4 and 10 members each.\n  I've used this exercise and similar ones in the past to poll the \nopinions of Idahoans on budget priorities and I've told Idahoans that I \nwould again use their responses in this exercise to fight for Idaho \nvalues in the Federal budget.\n  I have been reviewing in detail the individual results from each of \nthe five cities where we held the exercise, and I am struck by the \nhighlights that have emerged. I would like to summarize those briefly \nhere. My office is preparing a complete analysis to send to the Idaho \ncitizens who participated in those five cities.\n\n\n          Idaho's Priority: Balance the Budget and Spend Less\n\n  This is the result that stands out: Idahoans are demanding that we \nbalance the budget. By far, most of the Idaho groups were willing to \nexercise more restraint, and balance the budget faster, than most \nMembers of Congress or the President.\n\n[[Page S5437]]\n\n  In 31 out of 32 groups, Idahoans were able to agree on enough deficit \nreduction to balance the budget by fiscal year 2002.\n  This is true--31 out of 32 balanced the budget--whether you compare \ntheir results against the baseline for fiscal year 1997 or the less \noptimistic baseline of fiscal year 1996, which is the one that was \nstill used in the Exercise workbook.\n  Thirty-one out of 32 groups saved more in spending than any budget \nbefore the Congress this year--more than the Budget Committee budget, \nmore than the Chafee-Breaux substitute, and certainly more than the \nPresident's budget.\n  In fact, 31 out of 32 groups reduced spending growth more over 5 \nyears than any Washington, DC, proposal would save over 6 years.\n  On average, participants in the five Idaho cities called for the \nfollowing levels of policy changes in spending programs, over 5 years:\n\n                                                          [In billions]\nIdaho Falls........................................................$679\nPocatello...........................................................662\nTwin Falls..........................................................656\nNampa...............................................................637\nBoise...............................................................671\n                                                               ________\n\n  Average for all 5 cities..........................................661\n\n  This compares with $428 billion in spending policy changes in this \nyear's committee-reported budget, and only $274 billion in the \nPresident's budget.\n\n\n                         Discretionary Spending\n\n  In the Idaho exercises, the five-city average for defense was to find \n$16 billion in savings over 5 years. Eight of the 32 groups voted for a \n$38-billion increase. These results seem to reflect the general \nconsensus in Idaho, the Nation, and even in Washington, DC, that \ndefense spending should not be changed greatly, in this changing and \nuncertain world.\n  All 32 groups reduced domestic discretionary spending more than any \nbudget now being debated on the Senate floor. Of course, they came \nclosest to the Budget Committee's budget.\n  In international affairs, the average 5-year savings from the Idaho \ngroups was $15 billion, compared with $12 billion in savings in the \nCommittee-reported budget, and with a slight increase in the \nPresident's budget.\n\n\n                          Entitlement Spending\n\n  Thirty out of 32 groups would reduce total entitlement spending more \nthan any proposal now before the Senate.\n  I think that result says something to those who accuse the committee-\nreported budget, as well as last year's Balanced Budget Act, of making \ndraconian cuts in spending.\n  With great uniformity, Idaho participants supported an average of $50 \nbillion in housing and welfare reforms over 5 years, which is more than \nthe President's 6-year proposal--$38 billion--and almost exactly the \nsame as the Budget Committee's 6-year figure--$54 billion. This says to \nme that the Senate is on track in this area.\n  Thirty-one of the 32 groups produced more direct savings in Medicare \nover 5 years than the Budget Committee budget over 5 years or the \nPresident's budget over the next 6 years. The average 5-year savings, \nwith little variation from town to town, were $135 billion, compared \nwith $115 billion over 5 years in the Budget Committee budget.\n  In addition, 28 out of 32 groups chose one or more ways to means-test \nentitlement benefits, including 23 groups that chose an across-the-\nboard approach that would result in additional Medicare savings, and 2 \nmore that voted for means-testing Medicare, specifically.\n  It bears repeating: Any savings from Medicare reforms will be used--\nby law, they must be used--to shore up a Medicare system that is now \nlosing money. We want Medicare to be there for those who need it. It \nwon't be there--it will be broke--in just 5 years, unless we begin \nreforms today. The Budget Committee budget doesn't cut Medicare. It \nwill provide more choice and more secure benefits in an improved \nsystem.\n\n\n                                Revenues\n\n  With regard to taxes, I was somewhat surprised at first, but the \nspecific options selected and the comments of a number of the \nparticipants shed some light.\n  A number of folks complained about static score-keeping that did not \nrecognize that some tax cuts lead to economic activity and more tax \nrevenues. I agree with them. But the exercise workbook estimates were \nbased on Congressional Budget Office estimates. In both cases, the \nbudget committees--here and in Idaho--agreed to be bound by an \n``outside'' referee.\n  A number of folks complained that they wanted to vote for tax relief, \nbut ran out of time, because that was the last section in the workbook. \nIn this exercise, unlike here in Washington, DC, budget-writers did not \nhave the luxury of ignoring the deadline to finish their work.\n  A number said that, while they could write a budget that got to \nbalance faster with some revenue increases, they didn't trust that \nWashington, DC, would use tax increases to reduce the deficit.\n  And finally, support for any revenue increases was extremely \nscattered among a wide variety of options, with the broadest consensus \non alcohol and/or tobacco excise taxes, occurring in only 13 of 32 \ngroups.\n  Overall, 9 groups voted for some tax relief. Twelve groups did not \nvote for any tax increase, and another 6 supported very small packages \nless than $41 billion over 5 years, a magnitude similar to the \nextensions and loophole-closings that have been discussed in Congress. \nThe median group raised revenues by only $34 billion.\n\n\n                               Conclusion\n\n  Mr. President, the exercise in hard choices has been an excellent \neducational tool for the public, very informative for Members of \nCongress--certainly including this Senator, and actually very enjoyable \nto participate in.\n  I believe most everyone who attended had a positive experience. Some \nfolks wished they could have had more time and more options. But there \nwas understanding that the exercise was written with a limited number \nof options, out of consideration for the participants--all of whom gave \nup an entire morning, afternoon, or evening to provide me with their \nviews.\n  I appreciate all the advice and help my staff and I have received \nfrom the Committee for a Responsible Budget in conducting this exercise \nin Idaho, especially from Carol Cox Wait, the committee's president, \nand Susan Tanaka, vice president.\n  Most of our colleagues will recognize the committee's name and work. \nIts board of directors includes many former Members of this and the \nother body, including several chairmen and ranking minority members of \nthe Budget Committees, as well as distinguished former public officials \nlike Paul Volcker of the Federal Reserve Board, Elmer Staats of the \nGeneral Accounting Office, and Rudolph Penner and Robert Reischauer of \nthe Congressional Budget Office.\n  The exercise workbook used by the Idaho participants was prepared for \nfiscal year 1996, because most of the 1997 budget work had not yet \nbegun in Washington, DC, and 1997 workbooks were not yet available. But \nwith the exception of some changes in economic and baseline \nassumptions, we know all too well that the 1997 budget debate is really \njust a continuation of the 1996 process.\n  Mr. HEFLIN. Mr. President, these budget proposals now being \nnegotiated will directly affect virtually every segment of the \nGovernment and every citizen of this country.\n  I am strongly in support of deficit reduction and favor the \nelimination of the national debt over a period of time. I have long \nsupported a balanced budget amendment to the Constitution. I supported \nthe 1993 reconciliation bill which has already led to significant \nreduction in our annual deficits. However, there is a right and wrong \nway to pursue the same goal.\n  There are proposals to adjust the Consumer Pricing Index [CPI] in an \nattempt to correct biases in its computation. This plan is to reduce \nthe CPI by one-half of a percentage point. I feel that this is nothing \nmore than masquerading an attempt to cut Social Security benefits and \nraise taxes.\n  As we all know, the CPI has a major effect on Federal outlays, \nrevenue, and the budget deficit. Outlays are affected because programs \nsuch as civil service retirement pay and Social Security benefits are \nadjusted so that the purchasing power of those payments will be \npreserved. Revenues are affected because taxes are adjusted so that \nincreases in income are taxed at a higher\n\n[[Page S5438]]\n\nrate only if the increase exceeds inflation. Due to the significant \nrelationship between the CPI and the budget, there has been much \nattention on how to contribute to the reduction of the deficit with the \nadjustment of the CPI.\n  Before we attempt to adjust the CPI, we should realize the enormous \neffect it will have on the senior citizens of our country. Coupled with \nthe proposed cuts in Medicare and Medicaid, an arbitrary reduction of \nthe CPI, which leads to a decrease in the Social Security cost-of-\nliving adjustments [COLA's], would take a great financial toll on the \nelderly. Social Security recipients rely on annual COLA's to ensure \nthat their purchasing power is not eroded by inflation. Just a small \npercentage reduction in the CPI can cause a substantial loss of \nbenefits over time. Due to the compounding effect, the older one gets, \nthe more money the beneficiary would lose. Economists have stated that \nthe cost of living for the elderly has risen faster than other age \ngroups. This is due to the rapid rise in health care services. It is \nbelieved that the current CPI actually understates the rate of \ninflation because the elderly spend such a large portion of their \nincome on health care.\n  In 1987, Congress called for a study to develop an experimental index \nfor consumers over the age of 62. This study revealed that indeed the \nindex for this group was understated and concluded that this was due to \nthe medical care component. This analysis was undertaken by the U.S. \nBureau of Labor Statistics [BLS], the organization that computes the \nCPI.\n  Moreover, now is not the time to adjust the CPI knowing that the BLS \nhas announced, as part of a continuing effort to update and improve the \nCPI, that it will be changing the way the CPI is calculated. This is \nestimated to reduce the CPI by approximately .3 percentage points. We \nshould allow the experts at BLS to engage in a thorough analysis \nwithout Congress interfering.\n  Mr. President, as one economist stated, this is merely ``an attempt \nto raise taxes invisibly, and lower Social Security invisibly, while \nappearing only to be scientifically correct in adjusting a bias.'' \nFinally, using funds generated by reducing Social Security COLA's to \ndiminish the deficit is a misuse of Social Security trust funds.\n  Mr. EXON. I suggest the absence of a quorum, and I ask unanimous \nconsent that the time be charged equally to both sides.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, how much time remains on the resolution?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico has 14 minutes and \nthe Senator from Nebraska does as well.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Would you tell me again, Mr. President?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska has 14 minutes and \nthe Senator from New Mexico has 14 minutes.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. You must be doing something with this time, Mr. \nParliamentarian. How does this happen? No matter what each side does, \nwe have 14 minutes each. You must be right on the ball.\n  Mr. EXON. We control only the timekeeper.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I have a conference report from 1975, a \nbudget resolution, just as a matter of information with reference to \nvarious items that have been discussed today of a parliamentary nature. \nI ask unanimous consent that the conference report be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n      Second Concurrent Resolution on the Budget Fiscal Year 1976\n\n       Mr. Muskie, from the committee of conference, submitted the \n     following conference report to accompany H. Con. Res. 466:\n       The committee on conference on the disagreeing votes of the \n     two Houses on the amendment of the Senate to the concurrent \n     resolution (H. Con. Res. 466) revising the congressional \n     budget for the United States Government for the fiscal year \n     1976, and directing certain reconciliation action, having \n     met, after full and free conference, have agreed to recommend \n     and do recommend to their respective Houses as follows:\n       That the House recede from its disagreement to the \n     amendment of the Senate and agree to the same with an \n     amendment as follows:\n       That the Congress hereby determines and declares, pursuant \n     to section 310(a) of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974, \n     that for the fiscal year beginning on July 1, 1975--\n       (1) The appropriate level of total budget outlays is \n     $374,900,000,000;\n       (2) The appropriate level of total new budget authority is \n     $408,000,000,000;\n       (3) The amount of the deficit in the budget which is \n     appropriate in the light of economic conditions and all other \n     relevant factors is $74,100,000,000;\n       (4) The recommended level of Federal revenues is \n     $300,800,000,000, and the House Committee on Ways and Means \n     and the Senate Committee on Finance shall submit to their \n     respective Houses legislation to decrease Federal revenues by \n     approximately $6,400,000,000; and\n       (5) The appropriate level of the public debt is \n     $622,600,000,000.\n       Sec. 2. The Congress hereby determines and declares, in the \n     manner provided in section 301(a) of the Congressional Budget \n     Act of 1974, that for the transition quarter beginning on \n     July 1, 1976--\n\n\n       JOINT EXPLANATORY STATEMENT OF THE COMMITTEE OF CONFERENCE\n\n       The managers on the part of the House and the Senate at the \n     conference on the disagreeing votes of the two Houses on the \n     amendment of the Senate to the concurrent resolution (H. Con. \n     Res. 466) revising the congressional budget for the United \n     States Government for the fiscal year 1976, and directing \n     certain reconciliation action, submit the following joint \n     statement to the House and the Senate in explanation of the \n     effect of the action agreed upon by the managers and \n     recommended in the accompanying conference report:\n\n               Second Concurrent Resolution on the Budget\n\n                                Outlays\n\n       The House resolution provided for total outlays in the \n     amount of $373.891 billion. The Senate amendment provided for \n     total outlays in the amount of $375.6 billlion.\n       The conference report provides for total outlays in the \n     amount of $374.9 billion. Estimates of outlays by functional \n     category of the budget is set forth below.\n\n                            Budget Authority\n\n       The House resolution provided for total new budget \n     authority in the amount of $408.004 billion. The Senate \n     amendment provided for total new budget authority in the \n     amount of $406.2 billlion.\n       The conference report provides for total new budget \n     authority in the amount of $408.0 billion. Estimates of new \n     budget authority by functional category of the budget is set \n     forth below.\n\n                                Deficit\n\n       The house resolution provided for a budget deficit in the \n     amount of $72.091 billion. The Senate amendment provided for \n     a deficit in the amount of $74.8 billlion. The conference \n     report provides for a deficit of $74.1 billion.\n\n                                Revenues\n\n       The House resolution provided for Federal revenues in the \n     amount of $301.8 billion; and to achieve that level, it \n     directed the House Ways and Means and Senate Finance \n     Committees to reduce revenues by $5.4 billion. The Senate \n     amendment provided for revenues in the amount of $300.8 \n     billion; and to achieve that level it directed the Ways and \n     Means and Finance Committees to reduce revenues by $6.4 \n     billion.\n       The conference report provides for revenues in the amount \n     of $300.8 billion; and directs the Ways and means and Finance \n     Committees to reduce revenues by $6.4 billion. The $6.4 \n     billion reduction of revenues is necessary to maintain the \n     personal income tax withholding rate and extend the temporary \n     corporate tax reductions in the 1975 Tax Reduction Act.\n       The managers accept the Senate position that it is \n     unrealistic to expect this required reduction in revenues to \n     be partially offset by $1.0 billion to be received through \n     tax reform during the remiander of Fiscal year 1976, as \n     contemplated in the house resolution.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I want to say to the Senators--Senator \nExon just reminded me--that there will be no votes tonight. We had not \nplanned on any votes during the day, and nothing has changed. So when \nwe finish here in about 20 minutes we will be finished, and we will \nstart at 9 o'clock in the morning. We have been authorized to call the \nSenate into session, and we will immediately start with the amendments, \nestablishing some order this evening. Staff on both sides will work on \nthat. Remember that the amendments then will be voted on one after \nanother. Maybe we will have a little recess at some point. There will \nbe 10-minute rollcall votes. If last year is any indication of how much \ntime it will take, we will be voting from 9 o'clock to well into the \nnight.\n  I am very hopeful that we can accept some of these amendments. I am \neven toying with the idea--I do not know\n\n[[Page S5439]]\n\nwhat the Senator would think about this--if we might put all of those \namendments that are sense of the Senate and just accept them all. What \ndoes the Senator think about that? We would not have any votes. We \nwould take them all. Who knows what will happen to them?\n  Mr. EXON. We would want to review them. But that is an interesting \nproposal. Could I suggest one other thing that we might consider? We do \nnot have to decide on that tonight. But I would like to suggest since \nwe are going to have, once again, an awful lot of votes, would there be \nany likelihood that we may cut the votes down to say 7\\1/2\\ minutes to \nmove things along in a more expeditious fashion, because we I think \nwould agree tonight that we would probably have 1 minute each for \nexplanation of each amendment.\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I think we may be closer to 1 minute equally divided--\n30 seconds each. But essentially last time we had this rather prolonged \nseries of votes we tried to get it down to the minimum amount that \nwould be required for the rollcall and other things, and I believe I \nheard Senator Dole ask and they said they could not get it down to much \nunder 8 minutes.\n  Mr. EXON. My only thought with that is that might be the case. The \nonly trouble with 10 minutes, then it becomes 12 minutes. It is like \nspeeders on the highway. But I am just making a suggestion to try to \nexpedite things for the good of the body as a whole. We can discuss \nthat later.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4026\n\n    (Purpose: To express the sense of the Senate that the Economic \n Development Administration should place high priority on maintaining \n           field-based economic development representatives)\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Now, Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk in \nbehalf of Senators Bingaman, Snowe, Cohen, and myself and ask for its \nimmediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows.\n\n       The Senator from New Mexico [Mr. Domenici], for Mr. \n     Bingaman, for himself, Ms. Snowe, Mr. Cohen, and Mr. \n     Domenici, proposes an amendment numbered 4026.\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the end of title III, add the following:\n\n     SEC  . SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING THE ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT \n                   ADMINISTRATION PLACING HIGH PRIORITY ON \n                   MAINTAINING FIELD-BASED ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT \n                   REPRESENTATIVES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate makes the following findings:\n       (1) The Economic Development Administration plays a crucial \n     role in helping economically disadvantaged regions of the \n     United States develop infrastructure that supports and \n     promotes greater economic activity and growth, particularly \n     in nonurban regions.\n       (2) The Economic Development Administration helps to \n     promote industrial park development, business incubators, \n     water and sewer system improvements, vocational and technical \n     training facilities, tourism development strategies, \n     technical assistance and capacity building for local \n     governments, economic adjustment strategies, revolving loan \n     funds, and other projects which the private sector has not \n     generated or will not generate without some assistance from \n     the Government through the Economic Development \n     Administration.\n       (3) The Economic Development Administration maintains 6 \n     regional offices which oversee staff that are designated \n     field-based representatives of the Economic Development \n     Administration, and these field-based representatives provide \n     valuable expertise and counseling on economic planning and \n     development to nonurban communities.\n       (4) The Economic Development Administration Regional \n     Centers are located in the urban areas of Austin, Seattle, \n     Denver, Atlanta, Philadelphia, and Chicago.\n       (5) Because of a 37-percent reduction in approved funding \n     for salaries and expenses from fiscal year 1995, the Economic \n     Development Administration has initiated staff reductions \n     requiring the elimination of 8 field-based positions. The \n     field-based economic development representative positions \n     that are either being eliminated or not replaced after \n     voluntary retirement and which currently interact with \n     nonurban communities on economic development efforts cover \n     the States of New Mexico, Arizona, Nevada, North Dakota, \n     Oklahoma, Illinois, Indiana, Maine, Connecticut, Rhode \n     Island, and North Carolina.\n       (6) These staff cutbacks will adversely affect States with \n     very low per-capita personal income, including New Mexico \n     which ranks 47th in the Nation in per-capita personal income, \n     Oklahoma ranking 46th, North Dakota ranking 42nd, Arizona \n     ranking 35th, Maine ranking 34th, and North Carolina ranking \n     33rd.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that the functional totals and reconciliations instructions \n     underlying this budget resolution assume that--\n       (1) it is regrettable that the Economic Development \n     Administration has elected to reduce field-based economic \n     development representatives who are fulfilling the Economic \n     Development Administration's mission of interacting with and \n     counseling nonurban communities in economically disadvantaged \n     regions of the United States;\n       (2) the Economic Development Administration should take all \n     necessary and appropriate actions to ensure that field-based \n     economic development representation receives high priority; \n     and\n        (3) the Economic Development Administration should \n     reconsider the planned termination of field-based economic \n     development representatives responsible for States that are \n     economically disadvantaged, and that this reconsideration \n     take place without delay.\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. That amendment will take its place.\n  The Senator is willing to accept it. We have no objection to the \namendment, and I yield back all time on the amendment.\n  Mr. EXON. We agree on this side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the amendment is agreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 4026) was agreed to.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 4002, as modified\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Senator Lott has asked that I submit an amendment to \nthe desk with reference to Iraq oil and the amendment that heretofore \nhad been offered.\n  I send it to the desk. It is a modification of his previous \namendment.\n  I ask unanimous consent that it be in order for Senator Lott to \nmodify the previous amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  The amendment (No. 4002), as modified, is as follows:\n\n       At the end of title III, add the following new section:\n\n     SEC.  . SENSE OF CONGRESS ON REIMBURSEMENT OF THE UNITED \n                   STATES FOR OPERATIONS SOUTHERN WATCH AND \n                   PROVIDE COMFORT.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Congress finds that--\n       (1) as of May 1996, the United States has spent \n     $2,937,000,000 of United States taxpayer funds since the \n     conclusion of the Gulf War in 1991 for the singular purpose \n     of protecting the Kurdish and Sunni population from Iraqi \n     aggression;\n       (2) the President's defense budget request for 1997 \n     includes an additional $590,100,000 for Operations Southern \n     Watch and Provide Comfort, both of which are designed to \n     restrict Iraqi military aggression against the Kurdish and \n     Sunni people of Iraq;\n       (3) costs for these military operations constitute part of \n     the continued budget deficit of the United States; and\n       (4) United Nations Security Council Resolution 986 (1995) \n     (referred to as ``SCR 986'') would allow Iraq to sell up to \n     $1,000,000,000 in petroleum and petroleum products every 90 \n     days, for an initial period of 180 days.\n       (b) Sense of the Congress.--It is the sense of the Congress \n     that the assumptions underlying the functional totals in this \n     resolution assume that--\n       (1) the President should instruct the United States \n     Permanent Representative to the United Nations to ensure any \n     subsequent extension of authority beyond the 180 days \n     originally provided by SCR 986, specifically mandates and \n     authorizes the reimbursement of the United States for costs \n     associated with Operations Southern Watch and Provide Comfort \n     out of revenues generated by any sale of petroleum or \n     petroleum-related products originating from Iraq;\n       (2) in the event that the United States Permanent \n     Representative to the United Nations fails to modify the \n     terms of any subsequent resolution extending the authority \n     granted by SCR 986 as called for in paragraph (1), the \n     President should reject any United Nations' action or \n     resolution seeking to extend the terms of the oil sale beyond \n     the 180 days authorized by SCR 986;\n       (3) the President should take the necessary steps to ensure \n     that--\n       (A) any effort by the United Nations to temporarily lift \n     the trade embargo for humanitarian purposes, specifically the \n     sale of petroleum or petroleum products, restricts all \n     revenues from much sale from being diverted to benefit the \n     Iraqi military; and\n       (B) the temporary lifting of the trade embargo does not \n     encourage other countries to take steps to begin promoting \n     commercial relations with the Iraqi military in expectation \n     that sanctions will be permanently lifted; and\n       (4) revenues reimbursed to the United States from the oil \n     sale authorized by SCR 986, or any subsequent action or \n     resolution, should be used to reduce the Federal budget \n     deficit.\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, on Friday, May 17, 1996, I proposed a sense-\nof-Senate resolution that urged the President\n\n[[Page S5440]]\n\nof the United States to ensure that American taxpayers' interests are \nprotected by rejecting any Iraq-United Nations oil sale agreement which \ndoes not reimburse the United States for the costs of Operations \nSouthern Watch and Provide Comfort.\n  To review the background leading to this amendment, several days \nprior to the cease-fire ending Operation Desert Storm, Iraq initiated \nmilitary action against the Kurdish people in northern Iraq and the \nSunni Moslems in southern Iraq. On April 5, 1991, 2 days prior to \nconcluding the cease-fire agreement, the United Nations passed Security \nCouncil Resolutions No. 687 and 688, condemning Iraq for its repressive \nactions against the Kurds and Sunnis.\n  The Secretary General of the United States Nations then enlisted the \nsupport of the United States to engage in military operations to \nprotect these Iraqi civilian populations against Saddam Hussein's \naggression. In addition to the 15 American and 11 foreign national \nlives lost, the United States has spend $2.9 billion to conduct these \nmilitary operations known as Provide Comfort and Southern Watch. But \nthe cost continues to go up. The President's 1997 defense budget \nrequest includes an additional $590.1 million to continue these \nmilitary operations.\n  On April 14, 1995, the United Nations adopted another Security \nCouncil resolution, No. 986. This resolution provides Iraq the \nopportunity to sell as much as $2 billion in oil and oil-related \nproducts every 6 months for the purpose of providing food and medical \nrelief to the people of Iraq.\n  Yesterday, Iraq accepted the U.N. offer to sell limited supplies of \noil to buy food and medicine for its people. Iraq oil could begin to \nflow with 30 to 60 days while American tax dollars continue to be spent \nto prevent Suddam's aggression against the Kurds and Sunnis. I think \nthis is wrong.\n  The amendment that I offered last Friday, and have had to modify \nslightly because Iraq agreed to the U.N. offer, does not prevent the \nsale of oil or prevent efforts to relieve the humanitarian problems of \nIraq. It simply states that if Iraq is going to be allowed to sell oil \nthen the United States should recover the money our taxpayers are \nspending for the ultimate humanitarian assistance: military protection. \nUnder this resolution the United Nations is recovering their costs for \nproviding humanitarian relief. So why not recover the American \ntaxpayers' expense for preventing Suddam's aggression?\n  Because the oil deal was accepted by Iraq yesterday, I have modified \nthe amendment to state that in any subsequent extension of authority \nbeyond the 180 days originally provided by Security Council Resolution \n986, the Untied States should be reimbursed for the costs associated \nwith Operations Southern Watch and Provide Comfort. I think the \nAmerican taxpayer is entitled to some recovery from these oil sales to \nhelp offset the costs of doing what is right and doing it in \nconjunction with the United Nations.\n  Mr. President, I urge at the appropriate time that this amendment be \nadopted. It is a sense-of-the-Senate resolution, and I think that the \nAmerican people would want us to ensure that they are reimbursed for \ntheir costs associated with Operations Southern Watch and Provide \nComfort.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 4027 to Amendment No. 4012\n\n  (Purpose: To adjust the fiscal year 1997 non-defense discretaionary \n  allocation to the Appropriations Committee by $5 billion in budget \n authority and $4 billion in outlays to sustain 1996 post-OCRA policy)\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, there is pending an amendment No. 4012 \noffered by Senators Harkin and Specter. It is obvious that when we \nclose up the Senate here in a few minutes and yield back the remaining \ntime--and there is not much time remaining--there will be no further \namendments that will be allowed. It means that if the Senator from New \nMexico or anyone else has a second-degree amendment to any of the \nmyriad of amendments we have in the long list, including the Harkin-\nSpecter amendment, they would be able to offer a second-degree \namendment.\n  And because I have an amendment, a second-degree amendment to the \nHarkin-Specter amendment which I want the Senate to know about, I ask \nunanimous consent that it be in order for me to offer the second-degree \namendment tonight and get it in the Record with a statement. I do not \nthink I am denying anybody anything by doing that because in just a few \nmoments this will have ripened into a situation where when that \namendment comes up, I could second degree it. So since that is the \ncase, I ask unanimous consent that it be in order for the Senator from \nNew Mexico to offer a second-degree amendment to the Harkin amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. EXON. We have no objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The clerk \nwill report the second-degree amendment.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I send the amendment to the desk.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from New Mexico [Mr. Domenici] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 4027 to amendment No. 4012.\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n       At the appropriate places in the Harkin amendment, make the \n     following changes:\n       On page 25, line 17, increase

This amendment is essentially across the appropriations \nspectrum, that is, across all of the bills, adds $5 billion in budget \nauthority and $4 billion in outlays for nondefense discretionary \nprograms for the year 1997.\n  Mr. President, the Specter-Harkin amendment would provide $2.7 \nbillion for the education and training and health functions using an \nacross-the-board reduction to agency administrative budgets--both \ndefense and nondefense--including travel and contractual obligations--\nto offset this additional spending.\n  The amendment adds back the full $2.7 billion in both budget \nauthority and outlays for spending to these budget functions and \nadjusts the discretionary spending caps to reduce the defense cap and \nincrease the nondefense cap.\n  I am offering a second degree amendment because I believe this \namendment gets us into trouble.\n  By adding these funds only to education and training and health, \nother subcommittees will be left making difficult spending choices, \nendanger other priority programs, and even head toward confrontation \nwith the President as he looks at vetoes for bills that cut important \nFederal programs too deeply.\n  This amendment provides $5.0 billion in budget authority and $4.0 \nbillion in outlays for nondefense discretionary spending in fiscal year \n1997. Every function with nondefense discretionary spending which is \nbelow a freeze is restored to a freeze level that reflects the \nenactment of the 1996 Omnibus Consolidated Rescissions and \nAppropriations Act.\n  Functions in the budget resolution that are above a freeze--natural \nresources and environment, veterans, the crime control trust fund--are \nleft at those levels.\n  This freeze level differs somewhat from the budget resolution freeze \nlevel. Before the enactment of the 1996 omnibus appropriations bill, \nCongress had provided approximately $3.3 billion in emergency disaster \nfunding for the Federal Emergency Management Agency, and $500 million \nfor other disaster-related programs.\n  These disaster funds, which are essentially one-time emergency \nexpenditures, are built into the post-OCRA freeze level used by the \nAppropriations Committees, spending more than ongoing Federal programs.\n  We do have to make choices as we allocate taxpayer dollars. The \nbudget resolution makes some assumptions about where spending \npriorities lie. The Appropriations Committees will make their own \ndetermination and refer that allocation to the full House and Senate in \nthe form of 13 annual appropriations bills.\n  Congress can accept or reject those bills, but I believe we need to \nbe balanced in our approach to spending decisions.\n  Under the Harkin-Specter amendment, adding the $2.7 billion to \neducation, training, and health would require cutting nondefense \nprograms by another $1.2 billion.\n  What programs will be affected by those cuts?\n  WIC? Veterans health? The Environment? Housing? Agriculture? \nCommunity and rural development? Law enforcement? Basic scientific \nresearch? Transportation? The space program?\n  To help pay for these addbacks, defense programs would be cut by up \nto $1.5 billion. Again, what will be affected by this reduction? There \nare serious readiness and procurement underfunding problems in the \ndefense budget, which this budget resolution seeks to address.\n  I believe the assumptions of the balanced budget resolution are \ndefensible. We should not reduce defense below the level recommended in \nthe resolution because readiness is key to a strong defense for our \nNation.\n  Likewise, we should at least freeze non-defense spending at the 1996 \nlevel which reflects the agreement between Congress and the President \nin the Omnibus Appropriation Act.\n  I recognize that nondefense discretionary spending was the only \nportion of the Federal budget that significantly contributed to deficit \nreduction in 1996. This was due to the President's veto of the Balanced \nBudget Act, which included reform of major entitlement and mandatory \nprograms.\n  Today, I am saying we can do better than a freeze to keep some of our \npriority domestic programs operating effectively in 1997. These \nadditional amounts are offset with the administration's debt collection \nreforms that were not included in OCRA. I urge the adoption of this \namendment.\n  I might just say for those who are interested in what prompts this, I \nhave seen some early allocation of the assets given to the \nAppropriations Committee by the House budget resolution called \ntechnically the allocation of the money, that is, a big pot of money is \ndivvied up, and I note that somehow or another the House appropriators \nseem to be saying we are going to make a couple of the subcommittees, \nin particular one of them, not only whole but real whole, and make sure \nthat is not subject to any veto. We are going to put a lot of money in \nit. That is the labor, health and human services.\n  I am not arguing that point. What I am arguing at this point if that \nis done on a budget that was submitted for all of the appropriations, I \ndid not assume any such thing when I worked on this budget resolution. \nIf it had been the case and thus resulting in some subcommittees \ngetting a 10 percent cut--Interior, which the occupant of the chair \nwill have difficulty with. It covers the Indian people and a lot of \nother things getting a 7 to 10 percent cut, and others getting as much \nas a 25 percent cut--I would not favor the level of funding for the \nfirst year, 1997, that I did in this budget resolution.\n  I have just allowed for the Senate to approve some additional money. \nWe will go to conference with the House on the budget resolution and \nsee where it turns out. I am willing to discuss it further. There will \nnot be a lot of time, with 30 seconds on a side, but essentially \nanybody who would like to talk to me about it tomorrow, I will be \ndelighted to do that.\n  Mr. President, how much time is remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico has 4 minutes.\n\n[[Page S5442]]\n\n The Senator from Nebraska has 11 minutes 40 seconds.\n  Mr. EXON. In view of the arrangement we have reached, I yield back \nthe remainder of our time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator from New Mexico yield back \nthe time?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I thank Senator Exon for his courtesies. \nThis has been a very difficult budget resolution, in the sense that we \nhave considered, overall, maybe more than 50 amendments. While the \nSenator from New Mexico thinks that many of them, being sense of the \nSenate and not binding on anyone, probably used an awful lot of time \nthat was not necessary, that seems to be part of the U.S. Senate, and I \nam not complaining about it. But we have been here for a long time. \nThat means we had to work together, and I think we did that very well.\n  To the Senators, many who cooperated in using small amounts of time \nso their fellow Senators would have a chance to offer their amendments \nwith some explanation, I thank them, from both sides of the aisle, \nDemocrat and Republican.\n  With that, I yield the remainder of the time on the budget.\n  Mr. EXON. Before you yield back, will you yield to me for just a \nmoment? I want to return the nice compliment.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Certainly.\n  Mr. EXON. I have always enjoyed working very closely with my friend \nand colleague. We are going to have a very tough day tomorrow. We are \ngoing to move things as expeditiously as we can.\n  At the proper time tomorrow, I will take time to publicly thank the \nexcellent staff on this side and also the staff on that side of the \naisle for being constructive and helpful all the way through. It has \nbeen, once again, a unique experience. I have appreciated the courtesy \nthat is always extended to me by the chairman of the committee.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I thank Senator Exon very much.\n  Let me correct something. There have been a number of requests on our \nside and your side for 15 minutes in the morning. So if I can correct \nit, we will start voting at 9:15. That is what the unanimous consent \nwill state.\n  Mr. EXON. The 15 minutes will be morning business time?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. We will decide that later. We will be back on the \nbudget resolution at 9:15 instead of 9 o'clock.\n  Mr. EXON. At 9:15.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/05/21/senate-section/article/S5413-1", "month": "05", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "21", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5442]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY.

Mr. President, I rise today to discuss significant \nrecent developments in our aviation relations with the United Kingdom. \nIf handled properly by the administration, these developments could \nfinally lead to full liberalization of United States/United Kingdom air \nservice, our largest international aviation market.\n  Last week I spoke at some length in this body regarding my great \nfrustration with the current state of aviation relations between our \ntwo nations. In those remarks I predicted a time would come when the \nBritish truly would want some significant aviation rights or regulatory \nrelief from the United States. When that time came, I said I fully \nexpect the administration to demand a very high price. I welcome \nreports that time may be at hand.\n  Mr. President, I am referring to published reports that British \nAirways, which presently controls a greater share of the United States/\nUnited Kingdom air service market than all United States passenger \ncarriers combined, is close to announcing a major business alliance \nwith American Airlines. In anticipation of that announcement, British \nnegotiators came to Washington yesterday to assess the price tag for \nthe regulatory relief the new alliance would require. I am pleased \ninitial reports indicate the Department of Transportation [DOT] \nreaffirmed its longstanding position: Nothing short of full \nliberalization of the United States/United Kingdom air service market \nwould be acceptable.\n  Let me emphasize a critically important point. If the administration \nstands firm, as I believe it must, the current restrictive United \nStates/United Kingdom bilateral aviation agreement will be cast into \nthe great trash heap of protectionist trade policy where it belongs. \nThis would be very welcome news for the U.S. economy, all U.S. air \ncarriers and consumers. If the situation is handled poorly, however, we \nwill have to explain to future generations why we squandered our best \nopportunity in decades to liberalize the United States/United Kingdom \nair service market.\n  Since my remarks last week, I have been asked several questions I \nwish to address.\n  First, am I surprised my prediction has come to pass so quickly? No, \nnot in the least. For nearly a year I touted an open skies agreement \nwith Germany as the ideal competitive tool to pry open Britain's \nsignificantly restrictive air service market. In combination with open \nskies agreements already in place with 10 other European countries, the \nUnited States/German open skies agreement--which goes into full effect \nlater this week--is having precisely that effect.\n\n  Simply put, the possible British Airways/American Airlines alliance \nis a competitive response to the United States/German open skies \nagreement and the grant of antitrust immunity to the United Airlines/\nLufthansa alliance. If the Delta Air Lines alliance with three smaller \nEuropean carriers is granted a final antitrust immunity order later \nthis month, that alliance--in combination with the United and Northwest \nalliances--will mean nearly 50 percent of passenger traffic between the \nUnited States and the Europe will be carried on fully integrated \nalliances. I have predicted for some time British Airways would have no \nchoice but to respond. It now appears to be doing so by seeking to ally \nitself with the strongest U.S. carrier available and, ultimately, to \nseek antitrust immunity for its new alliance.\n  Second, to what am I referring when I say the British should be \nrequired to pay a high price for the regulatory relief British Airways' \nnew alliance would require? I believe the price tag must be nothing \nless than immediate open skies.\n  In the past, the British have been prone to redefine the term ``full \nliberalization'' to mean ``a balanced exchange of opportunities.'' \nTherefore, let me make clear what I mean when I say open skies. To \navoid any misunderstanding, I believe the administration should make \nvery clear to the British we expect at a minimum open third, fourth and \nfifth freedom rights for all our passenger and cargo carriers. Of \ncourse, this means that nothing less than open access to London's \nHeathrow Airport be included in the package.\n  Is this price too high? No, based on the recent history of United \nStates/United Kingdom aviation relations, I believe it is just about \nright. For instance, I remember all too well how the British Government \ntreated the United States in late 1990 and early 1991 when Pan Am was \non the brink of shutting down operations and needed immediately to sell \nits Heathrow routes to survive. The British government showed not one \niota of sympathy. Instead, at the urging of British Airways, for months \nthe British Government squeezed our government for maximum compensation \nin exchange for approving that transaction as well as the sale of TWA's \nHeathrow routes. I hope we remember well the lessons of the so-called \nHeathrow succession agreement.\n  Is it realistic to demand the British Government open Heathrow \nairport to our carriers? Absolutely. The British always seem able to \nfind space at Heathrow for non-U.S. carriers who pose less of a \ncompetitive challenge to British carriers. For instance, according to \nDOT, 24 of the airlines operating at Heathrow in July 1995 did not have\n\n[[Page S5443]]\n\nany services there in July 1990. In addition, British Airways controls \n37 percent of the slots at Heathrow. It clearly is in a position to \nhelp resolve the access to Heathrow challenge. In short, British \nAirways controls its own destiny if it truly wants DOT approval for its \nproposed new alliance.\n  Mr. President, let me conclude by saying a truly historic opportunity \nmay be at hand to finally force the British to join us on the field of \nfree and fair air service competition. The Administration must stand \nfirm and make clear to the British Government that nothing short of an \nopen skies agreement is the price tag for any regulatory relief British \nAirways might seek in connection with its possible new alliance. A \nfully liberalized United States/United Kingdom air service agreement is \ncritical to our economy, United States airlines and consumers and I \nfully expect we will not squander this opportunity.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/05/21/senate-section/article/S5442-2", "month": "05", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "21", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5443]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       THE VERY BAD DEBT BOXSCORE\n\n  Mr. HELMS.

A bill to establish in the Department of the Interior the \nEssex National Heritage Area Commission, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n\n\n              the essex national heritage area act of 1996\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, Senator Kerry and I are introducing \nlegislation today to establish the Essex Heritage District and \nCommission. The purpose of our legislation is to preserve for future \ngenerations the unique historic, cultural, and natural resources of \nEssex County, MA. A companion bill has been introduced in the House of \nRepresentatives by Congressmen Peter Torkildsen and Martin Meehan.\n  Essex County is the site of many historical events that have \nprofoundly influenced the course of American history over the past 350 \nyears. Concentrated in this area of less than 500 square miles are more \nthan 8,300 National Register properties and 23 national historic \nlandmarks related to the early settlement of the United States, the \ncountry's emergence as a major maritime power, and its subsequent \nindustrial development.\n  The historic sites include many examples of nationally significant \nearly architecture, including some of the finest examples of Georgian \nand Federal architecture to be found in the United States. Also still \nintact are 17th century marshland farms and rural home sites clustered \naround original commons. Active harbors have been in continuous use \nsince the 17th century. Local shipyards, lighthouses, and distinctive \nmaritime communities exemplify 18th century life. The first integrated \niron works in America are still in operation under the auspices of the \nNational Park Service. Textile mill villages and ``10-foot'' shops \nwhere shoes were made and sold in 10-foot-by-10-foot rooms still remain \nlargely as they were in the 19th century.\n  Essex County also has extensive natural and scenic resources--\nmarshlands, beaches, harbors, rocky farmlands, and islands--which amply \ndemonstrate why maritime pursuits and water-powered industrial \ndevelopment first began here.\n  At the heart of this region lies the city of Salem. It was settled in \n1626, 6 years after the Pilgrims landed in Plymouth. It became one of \nthe most active ports in the United States in the 18th century, \nconducting trade throughout the world and opening many new markets for \nimports and exports. Salem retains a wealth of resources from this \nperiod, including one of the country's few remaining colonial-period \nwharves; classic 17th century structures; four major historic districts \nencompassing thousands of facilities which preserve Salem as it \nappeared in the late 18th century; the internationally renowned Peabody \nEssex Museum, containing major collections of maritime art and history. \nChinese export wares and early anthropological collections; and many \nhistoric buildings associated with the life and work of one of \nAmerica's most famous authors, Nathaniel Hawthorne.\n  Salem also has many homes, meeting sites, and cemeteries associated \nwith the notorious witchcraft trials of 1692, which serve to remind \nresidents and visitors alike of the dangers of witch hunts and the \nimportance of the individual rights built into our Constitution a \ncentury later.\n  The purpose of our legislation is to preserve these extraordinary \nresources and make them available to the public. The Commission will \ncarry out the mission proposed in the Salem Project, a report issued by \nthe National Park Service in January 1990, which suggested a broadening \nof Federal recognition beyond the boundaries of Salem itself, to take \ninto account the shared historic themes formed throughout Essex County.\n\n  The success of the preservation effort at Salem Maritime National \nHistoric Site, the oldest such site in the country, established in \n1938, has encouraged local initiatives in many of the surrounding \ncommunities. Our legislation will build on that local interest by \nproviding a management framework for the preservation efforts of these \nvarious jurisdictions. Our goal is to protect and preserve these \nnationally significant resources in ways that present a unified \ninterpretive story for visitors, so that they can readily understand \nthe relationships among the historic sites throughout the county. The \nCommission will provide guidance to local communities and the State to \nensure that the goal is achieved. Our bill does not propose major \nFederal land acquisition or a Federal bureaucracy. Its modest Federal \ninvolvement will help local efforts to proceed smoothly.\n  The success of the Essex Heritage District and Commission depends on \nbroad-based support and participation by private citizens, businesses, \nnonprofit institutions and local, regional, and State governments. The \nmajority of funds to implement the countywide recommendations in the \nNational Park Service report is expected to come from the private \nsector and local sources.\n  Salem has demonstrated how successful this approach can be. In the \npast 8 years, Federal appropriations of $24 million for Salem Maritime \nNational Historic Site have led to more than $150 million in private, \nmunicipal, and State investments in projects which relate to the \nproposed Essex Heritage District. For example, the Peabody Essex Museum \nhas planned a $75 million expansion which will include renovation of \nthe Salem Armory building that now houses the Regional Visitor Center \nrun by the Park Service. The city of Salem is also planning an $18 \nmillion expansion of its port facilities, and has successfully pursued \nmatching funds for the reconstruction of the 18th century merchant ship \nFriendship.\n  At the county level, an Essex Heritage Commission, comprised of 46 \nvolunteer members from the private sector and municipal and State \ngovernments, is already well underway toward developing an action plan \nfor regional trails and exhibits. This fall, the Commission plans to \ninstall a regional signage system on the Federal and State highways to \nserve as a magnet and bring people into the Essex Heritage Area \nDistrict. Many community officials, board members, and representatives \nfrom other preservation and environmental organizations are providing \nvaluable assistance and coordination. But there is much more to be \ndone, and it is time for the Federal Government to play a role in this \npromising endeavor.\n  Its success so far has been based on the ability of people with many \ndifferent perspectives to work together. This legislation will help \nthem go forward in effective and efficient ways, as they work to bring \nthe region together and preserve these magnificent historical resources \nfor the enjoyment of generations to come. I urge my colleagues to \nsupport this important initiative.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1785\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS.\n\n       There are hereby authorized to be appropriated such sums as \n     may be necessary to carry out this Act.\n\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I am pleased to join, once again, with my \ncolleague from Massachusetts, Senator Kennedy, in introducing \nlegislation to create the Essex Heritage District and Commission with \nthe goal of preserving the unique resources of Essex County, MA for \nfuture generations.\n  Essex County, which stretches through Massachusetts' North Shore \ncommunities into the Merrimac River Valley and up to the New Hampshire \nborder, represents a mural of American history with its architecture, \nindustry, and culture. Within a county of only 500 square miles, there \nare nearly 80 historic districts which offer more examples of \nnationally significant early American architecture than any other place \nin the Nation. Included among these historical structures are 17th \ncentury marshland farms, rural homes, cemeteries, and original town \ncommons. The shoreline of Essex County contains shipyards, lighthouses, \nand harbors that have been active since the 17th century.\n  Together, these sites form a panorama of our Nation's development as \na maritime and industrial power. In the 18th century, this region \nbecame a mecca for American trade, a hub for trading goods with the \nother great trading nations. In response, the region flourished as a \nmanufacturing center, which led to the establishment and growth of the \ntextile and leather industries in the Merrimac River Valley towns of \nPeabody, Lawrence, Beverly, and Haverhill. The history of this growth \nis evident today in the textile mill villages, the first sustained \nintegrated iron works site, and one of the most significant planned \nmanufacturing cities in the country, all of which remain largely intact \ntoday.\n  At the heart of all this activity is the city of Salem. While Salem \nis famous in the history books and in American\n\n[[Page S5447]]\n\nlore as the site of the 1692 witch trials, it is equally important as \nan early landing point for some of the first English colonists and as \none of the most active ports of the 18th century. An amazing number of \nthese historical resources remain intact including a colonial period \nwharf and 17th and 18th century structures exemplifying Puritan \nsociety.\n  A tour through the historic districts of Essex County is a visual \nlesson in this important period of our Nation's past. We are lucky that \nso many of these historical resources remain to provide such a detailed \nrecord and we must work to ensure their continued protection through \nthe creation of the Essex Heritage District Commission. The Commission, \nwhich would be authorized for 10 years, would provide the long-term \ncommitment that is needed to bring about the success of this project. \nOf course, the primary mission would be preservation, but more than \nthis, the Commission will take individually preserved resources and \nlink them through a unified interpretive story of this region and its \nplace in our Nation's history.\n  While the Commission will be chartered by Federal legislation, it \nwill not be a project managed by the Federal Government nor will it \nrequire major Federal land acquisition. Instead, the Commission will be \ncomprised primarily of delegates from the State and local governments, \nnonprofit organizations, and private citizens and business interests \nfrom the participating communities.\n  This approach should prove very successful based upon the past \nefforts at the Salem Maritime National Historic Site which has \nleveraged significant local support from the surrounding communities. \nFor example, in the past 8 years, Federal appropriations of $24 million \nfor the Salem Maritime Site have leveraged more than $150 million in \nnon-Federal investments in Essex Heritage District projects, including \nsupport for the planned $75 million expansion of the Peabody Essex \nMuseum which will include renovation of the Salem Armory building that \nnow houses the Regional Visitor Center run by the National Park \nService.\n  Our bill would create a system under which various community groups \ncan come together to develop their own goals by combining historic and \nresource preservation with economic concerns. The preservation \nactivities which have already begun in Essex County have enhanced the \nregion as visitor attractions for its historic sites, its picturesque \nscenery, and its desirability as a place to live and do business. I \nhope the Senate will act to ensure this success through swift and \npositive action on this bill.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. WELLSTONE:\n  S. 1786. A bill to require the Secretary of Veterans Affairs and the \nSecretary of Health and Human Resources to carry out a demonstration \nproject to provide the Department of Veterans Affairs with \nreimbursement from the Medicare Program for health care services \nprovided to certain Medicare-eligible veterans; to the Committee on \nFinance.\n\n\n                 VA HEALTH CARE ELIGIBILITY LEGISLATION\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Madam President, I am pleased and honored to introduce \nlegislation which I believe will demonstrate the cost effectiveness and \nfeasibility of Medicare subvention funding to the Department of \nVeterans Affairs [VA] for treatment of some Medicare-eligible veterans \nat VA medical facilities. This legislation would authorize a \ndemonstration project of Medicare subvention whereby Medicare would \nreimburse VA for delivering health care to some veterans age 65 and \nover.\n  My legislation would authorize the Secretaries of Veterans Affairs \nand of Health and Human Services to enter into an agreement to carry \nout the demonstration project. This bill would bar reimbursement to the \nVA until the expenditure for health care services for participating \nveterans by a veterans integrated service network exceeds the amount \nthat the VA would expend for such services in the absence of the \nproject.\n  In effect, this ensures that VA will receive Medicare reimbursement \nonly for additional health care costs that are directly attributable to \nthe demonstration project. My bill would ensure that costs to the \nMedicare program of providing services under the project do not exceed \nthe usual costs Medicare would incur in providing such services.\n  To prevent red tape from delaying the start of this test, the \nlegislation specifies that VA health care facilities chosen to \nparticipate in the demonstration project will automatically be deemed \nto meet Medicare standards. Reimbursement to the VA will be on a \ncapitated basis and veterans age 65 and over who are not eligible for \nVA health care for a service-connected disability may be selected to \nparticipate in the project.\n  Madam President, I now want to address the two key reasons I am \nintroducing this legislation and will press for its passage. First, \nreforming veterans' health care is one of my highest priorities and I \nam quite frankly disappointed that the Senate has not yet emulated the \nHouse in taking significant bipartisan legislative action to reform \nunwieldy, arcane, and obsolete eligibility rules that Minnesota and \nother veterans face when they visit VA hospitals and clinics. While \nSecretary of Veterans Affairs Jesse Brown and his Under Secretary for \nHealth Ken Kizer have taken bold and innovative steps to modernize, \nrestructure and decentralize VA health care, their efforts to overhaul \nthe VA health care system--so that it will remain viable and serve the \nneeds of veterans into the 21st century--are being hamstrung by \noutmoded eligibility criteria that stress inpatient care even when \noutpatient care would be more appropriate, user-friendly and cost \neffective.\n  I believe that Medicare reimbursement is an important and, with an \naging veterans population, even an essential component of eligibility \nreform. My view is shared by major veterans service organizations \n[VSO's] which have submitted two different eligibility reform proposals \nthat would authorize the VA to receive Medicare reimbursement for \ntreating Medicare-eligible veterans. Medicare reimbursement will allow \nthe VA to offset the costs of delivering care to older veterans who may \ngain access to outpatient and preventive care when eligibility reform \nlegislation is enacted.\n\n  The GAO, however, has questioned both the feasibility and cost of \nproviding Medicare reimbursement to the VA. While I lean toward the \nVSO's view that Medicare reimbursement would be both feasible and cost-\neffective, the only way to prove it is by means of a demonstration \nproject. This is precisely what my legislation authorizes.\n  Second, because the VA is facing and will likely continue to face \nsevere funding constraints that probably will reduce its capabilities \nto provide access to quality health care, the VA will be under strong \npressure to deny some vital health care services to Medicare-eligible \nveterans.\n  In recent years the VA health care budget has lagged behind medical \ncost inflation and under the budget resolution adopted by Congress last \nyear the VA medical care budget would be frozen for 7 years, thus \nlagging behind overall inflation and probably even further behind \nmedical cost inflation. As a consequence, the VA may be compelled to \nfurther ration care, with veterans 65 and over one of the groups likely \nto be affected. Even before the VA was faced with a flat health care \nbudget, many of its facilities were compelled to resort to rationing.\n  In this connection it is important to note that recent GAO testimony \nbefore the Senate Subcommittee on VA, HUD, and Independent Agencies \nAppropriations underscored the fact that in 1993 ``118 VA medical \ncenters reported rationing some types of care to eligible veterans when \nthe centers ran short of resources.'' There is no doubt whatever that a \nflat VA health care budget for 7 years can only lead to more extensive \nrationing of health care for veterans. This will further fray our \nsolemn contract with the men and women who selflessly defended our \ncountry.\n  Madam President, this bill is intended to ensure that our aging \nveterans population is not denied access to VA health care precisely \nwhen they need it most. I believe that this demonstration project will \nshow that Medicare subvention will at least be budget neutral, and may \neven save Medicare dollars by using less costly VA care. But I would \nhope that even those who do not share my views would agree that the \ndemonstration project that I\n\n[[Page S5448]]\n\nam proposing is the best way of determining the impact on Medicare, the \nVA, and most important, our aging veterans. These brave men and women \ndeserve the best health care that can be provided, not rationed care \nwhose quality is determined by an eroding VA health care budget and not \nby the health care needs of veterans who risked their lives for this \ncountry at times when it was in dire peril.\n  Madam President, improving and protecting health care for the \nincreasing numbers of older veterans should be a priority issue for my \ncolleagues on both sides of the aisle. I hope all of my colleagues will \ncarefully scrutinize this bill, strongly support it, and join me in the \nfight to ensure its passage.\n  Madam President, I am introducing a bill today that focuses on health \ncare eligibility in the VA health care system. It is, interestingly \nenough, analogous to a bill that the majority leader, Senator Dole, has \nintroduced that essentially says for those Department of Defense \nretirees, that there can be a Medicare third-party payment for them to \ncontinue to receive health care within the military health care system. \nThat is put on a demonstration project basis. I think it is an \nimportant piece of legislation.\n  What the bill I have introduced says, again, on the demonstration \nmodel basis--demonstration project basis--is that for some of the \nveterans within a certain narrow framework, they also will be able to \nreceive health care within the VA health care coverage--within the VA \nhealth care system--with a Medicare third-party payment.\n  I now sit on the Veterans' Committee. It has taken me several years \nto get on that committee. These issues are near and dear to my heart. \nIt is clear to me, and I think it is clear to all Senators on both \nsides of the aisle, that health care eligibility is at the very top of, \nif you will, an agenda that is responsive to the concerns and \ncircumstances of the veterans community. This will be a demonstration \nmodel. That is what this bill calls for. I think it is extremely \nimportant.\n  There is a debate as to whether or not, for example, Medicare third-\nparty payment for the VA health care system will work well or not. The \nonly way we can find out, without having to debate ad nauseam, is to \nput this on a pilot project basis.\n  I think this is only a step, but this piece of legislation, if \npassed, either as a piece of legislation or an amendment on the \nappropriate vehicle, I think it is an extremely important step in the \nright direction of enabling us to do some things within our VA health \ncare system that will enable us to provide very efficient and very \neffective and very compassionate health care for veterans.\n  Also, Madam President, I want to mention that Dr. Ken Kizer, with the \nVA health care system, I think is really making a heroic effort to \nthink deeply about VA health care and where it is going into the next \ncentury.\n  I think he is joined by Secretary Jesse Brown. Secretary Brown, in my \nview as a Senator from Minnesota--and I think I have been a fierce \nadvocate for veterans--has been a very powerful and very articulate \nadvocate for veterans in this country. I know that he has put health \ncare eligibility reform at the very top of his list of priorities. I \nknow that he cares deeply about veterans. I know as someone who was \nvery active within the DAV, Disabled Veterans of America, he knows \nthese issues. They are not abstract or intellectual to him. He came to \nthis Cabinet position as someone who has been down in the trenches \nstruggling not only for disabled veterans but for all vets.\n  So with the time I have on the floor, again I am devoted to this \npiece of legislation which I have introduced. I think there is going to \nbe strong bipartisan support for this.\n  I also want to say a few words about the Secretary of Veterans \nAffairs because I think he has been a great Secretary for the veterans \nof Minnesota and across the country.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. PRESSLER (for himself, Mr. D'Amato, Mr. Breaux and Mr. \n        Graham):\n  S. 1787. A bill to amend the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United \nStates with respect to fireworks; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n                         Fireworks legislation\n\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation that \nwould correct a mistake made during the drafting of the implementing \nlegislation of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade [GATT] \nUruguay round. That law has had the effect of unintentionally more than \ndoubling the tariff rates on display fireworks that are imported into \nthe United States. Unintended or not, this provision has had real \nconsequences. The most obvious has been a dramatic increase in the \nprice of display fireworks, the vast majority of which are purchased by \nour State and local governments for use in municipal celebrations.\n  While we are struggling here in Congress to reduce the deficit and \nbalance the Federal budget under tight economic constraints, State and \nlocal governments are required by law to balance their budgets every \nyear--with far less flexibility and far fewer resources than what is \navailable to the Federal Government.\n  The higher cost of display fireworks imposes major strain on \nmunicipalities that wish to sponsor Memorial Day or Fourth of July \ncelebrations. Many towns simply are unable to afford the higher \nfireworks prices and some may forego these celebrations altogether. \nIt's a sad fact that one unfortunate consequence leads to others.\n  These problems are especially troublesome for rural areas. Small \ncities and towns do not have a wide variety of options for purchasing \ntheir fireworks. A dramatic increase in the cost of fireworks leaves \nthese towns with very few alternatives. The ripple effect of this is \nthat the small companies that serve as fireworks distributors suffer \nsales losses.\n  This is not just mere speculation. There is a family-owned business \nin my State of South Dakota called Rich Bros. Fireworks. Michael Rich \nand his family serve the small towns across our State. The Rich family \ndoes it because they enjoy the service they provide. Mr. President, \nthis is not a highly profitable business to begin with, and the higher \nprices resulting from the GATT implementing legislation have caused \ndemand to decline. Michael Rich has informed me that unless corrective \naction is taken, they may be forced to close their business by the end \nof the year. The name Rich Bros. is synonymous with July 4th in South \nDakota, and kids across the State--young kids, and grown-up kids \nalike--look forward to the celebration of the birth of our country with \nall the fanfare and excitement fireworks provide.\n  Family-owned businesses, such as Rich Bros., are the foundation of \ntowns across South Dakota. These people are committed to their \nneighbors and to their communities. They should not suffer from \nunintended consequences of the law. That is why we are here--to look \nout for them and to correct problems like these as soon as possible. \nThat is why I am introducing this legislation today. It is really a \nminor change that would make a major difference--perhaps the difference \nbetween life and death--for small businesses like Rich Bros. I ask my \ncollea- \ngues for their support in passing this legislation which restores the \n2.4-percent tariff rate for display fireworks that existed prior to the \nimplementation of the Uruguay round legislation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1787\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING THE NATIONAL INSTITUTE \n                   OF DRUG ABUSE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n       (1) The National Institute on Drug Abuse (hereafter \n     referred to in this section as ``NIDA'') a part of the \n     National Institutes of Health (hereafter referred to in this \n     section\n\n[[Page S5450]]\n\n     as ``NIH'') supports over 85 percent of the world's drug \n     abuse research that has totally revolutionized our \n     understanding of addiction.\n       (2) One of NIDA's most significant areas of research has \n     been the identification of the neurobiological bases of all \n     aspects of addiction, including craving.\n       (3) In 1993, NIDA announced that approval had been granted \n     by the Food and Drug Administration of a new medication for \n     the treatment of heroin and other opiate addiction which \n     breaks the addict of daily drug-seeking behavior and allows \n     for greater compliance because the patient does not need to \n     report to a clinic each day to have the medication \n     administered.\n       (4) Among NIDA's most remarkable accomplishments of the \n     past year is the successful immunization of animals against \n     the psycho-stimulant effects of cocaine.\n       (5) NIDA has also recently announced that it is making \n     substantial progress that is critical in directing their \n     efforts to identify potential anti-cocaine medications. For \n     example, NIDA researchers have recently shown that activation \n     in the brain of one type of dopamine receptor suppresses \n     drug-seeking behavior and relapse, whereas activation of \n     another, triggers drug-seeking behavior.\n       (6) NIDA's efforts to speed up research to stem the tide of \n     drug addiction is in the best interest of all Americans.\n       (7) State and local governments spend billions of dollars \n     to incarcerate persons who commit drug related offenses.\n       (8) A 1992 National Report by the Bureau of Justice \n     Statistics revealed that more than 3 out of 4 jail inmates \n     reported drug use in their lifetime, more than 40 percent had \n     used drugs in the month before their offense with 27 percent \n     under the influence of drugs at the time of their offense. A \n     significant number said they were trying to get money for \n     drugs when they committed their crime.\n       (9) More than 60 percent of juveniles and young adults in \n     State-operated juvenile institutions reported using drugs \n     once a week or more for at least a month some time in the \n     past, and almost 40 percent reported being under the \n     influence of drugs at the time of their offense.\n       (10) This concurrent resolution proposes that budget \n     authority for the NIH (including NIDA) be held constant at \n     the fiscal year 1996 level of $11,950,000,000 through \n     fiscal year 2002.\n       (11) At such appropriation level, it would be impossible \n     for NIH and NIDA to maintain research momentum through \n     research project grants.\n       (12) Level funding for NIH in fiscal year 1997 would reduce \n     the number of competing research project grants by nearly \n     500, from 6,620 in fiscal year 1996 to approximately 6,120 \n     competing research project grants, reducing NIH's ability to \n     maintain research momentum and to explore new ideas in \n     research.\n       (13) NIH is the world's preeminent research institution \n     dedicated to the support of science inspired by and focused \n     on the challenges of human illness and health.\n       (14) NIH programs are instrumental in improving the quality \n     of life for Americans through improving health and reducing \n     monetary and personal costs of illnesses.\n       (15) The discovery of an anti-addiction drug to block the \n     craving of illicit addictive substances will benefit all of \n     American society.\n       (b) Sense of the Congress.--It is the sense of the Congress \n     that amounts appropriated for the National Institutes of \n     Health--\n       (1) for fiscal year 1997 should be increased by a minimum \n     of $33,000,000;\n       (2) for fiscal year 1998 should be increased by a minimum \n     of $67,000,000;\n       (3) for fiscal year 1999 should be increased by a minimum \n     of $100,000,000;\n       (4) for fiscal year 2000 should be increased by a minimum \n     of $100,000,000;\n       (5) for fiscal year 2001 should be increased by a minimum \n     of $100,000,000;\n       (6) for fiscal year 2002 should be increased by a minimum \n     of $100,000,000;\n\n     above its fiscal year 1996 appropriation for additional \n     research into an anti-addiction drug to block the craving of \n     illicit addictive substances.\n                                 ______\n\n\n                        HELMS AMENDMENT NO. 4021\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI (for Mr. Helms) proposed an amendment to the concurrent \nresolution (S.

SENSE OF THE SENATE--TRUTH IN BUDGETING.\n\n       It is the Sense of the Senate that:\n       (a) The Congressional Budget Office has scored revenue \n     expected to be raised from the auction of Federal \n     Communications Commission licenses for various services;\n       (b) For budget scoring purposes, the Congress has assumed \n     that such auctions would occur in a prompt and expeditious \n     manner and that revenue raised by such auctions would flow to \n     the federal treasury;\n       (c) The Resolution assumes that the revenue to be raised \n     from auctions totals billions of dollars;\n       (d) The Resolution makes assumptions that services would be \n     auctioned where the Federal Communications Commission has not \n     yet conducted auctions for such services, such as Local \n     Multipoint Distribution Service (LMDS), licenses for paging \n     services, final broadband PCS licenses, narrow band PCS \n     licenses, licenses for unserved cellular, and Digital Audio \n     Radio (DARS), and other subscription services, revenue from \n     which has been assumed in Congressional budgetary \n     calculations and in determining the level of the deficit; and\n       (e) The Commission's service rules can dramatically affect \n     license values and auction revenues and therefore the \n     Commission should act expeditiously and without further delay \n     to conduct auctions of licenses in a manner that maximizes \n     revenue, increases efficiency, and enhances competition for \n     any service for which auction revenues have been scored by \n     the Congressional Budget Office and/or counted for budgetary \n     purposes in an Act of Congress.\n                                 ______\n\n\n                  FAIRCLOTH AMENDMENTS NOS. 4023-4024\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI (for Mr. Faircloth) proposed two amendments to the \nconcurrent resolution (S.

SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING WELFARE REFORM.\n\n       The Senate finds that--\n       S. Con. Res. 57 assumes substantial savings from welfare \n     reform; and\n       Children born out of wedlock are five times more likely to \n     be poor and about ten times more likely to be extremely poor \n     and therefore are more likely to receive welfare benefits \n     that children from two parent families; and\n       High rates of out-of-wedlock births are associated with a \n     host of other social pathologies; for example, children of \n     single mothers are twice as likely to drop out of high \n     school; boys whose fathers are absent are more likely to \n     engage in criminal activities; and girls in single-parent \n     families are three times more likely to have children out of \n     wedlock themselves; therefore\n       It is the sense of the Senate that any comprehensive \n     legislation sent to the President that balances the budget by \n     a certain date and that includes welfare reform provisions \n     and that is agreed to by the Congress and the President shall \n     also contain to the maximum extent possible a strategy for \n     reducing the rate of out-of-wedlock births and encouraging \n     family formation.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4024\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC.   .

Res. 57 projects a public debt in Fiscal Year 1997 \n     of $5,400,000,000,000;\n       S. Con. Res. 57 projects that the public debt will be \n     $6,500,000,000,000 in the Fiscal Year 2002 when the budget \n     resolution projects a unified budget surplus;\n       This accumulated debt represents a significant financial \n     burden that will require excessive taxation and lost economic \n     opportunity for future generations of the United States; \n     therefore\n       It is the sense of the Senate that any comprehensive \n     legislation sent to the President that balances the budget by \n     a certain date and that is agreed to by the Congress and the \n     President shall also contain a strategy for reducing the \n     national debt of the United States.\n                                 ______\n\n\n[[Page S5451]]\n\n\n\n                   ROTH (AND EXON) AMENDMENT NO. 4025\n\n  Mr. EXON.

SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING THE FUNDING OF AMTRAK.\n\n       (a) Finding.--The Senate finds that--\n       (1) a capital funding stream is essential to the ability of \n     the National Rail Passenger Corporation (``Amtrak'') to \n     reduce its dependence on Federal operating support; and\n       (2) Amtrak needs a secure of financing, no less favorable \n     than provide to other modes of transportation, for capital \n     improvements.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that--\n       (1) revenues attributable to one-half cent per gallon of \n     the excise taxes imposed on gasoline, special motor fuel, and \n     diesel fuel from the Mass Transit Account should be dedicated \n     to a new Intercity Passenger Rail Trust Fund during the \n     period January 1, 1997, through September 30, 2001;\n       (2) revenues would not be deposited in the Intercity \n     Passenger Rail Trust Fund during any fiscal year to the \n     extent that the deposit is estimated to result in available \n     revenues in the Mass Transit Account being insufficient to \n     satisfy that year's estimated appropriation levels;\n       (3) monies in the Intercity Passenger Rail Trust Fund \n     should be generally available to fund, on a reimbursement \n     basis, capital expenditures incurred by Amtrak; and\n       (4) amounts to fund capital expenditures related to rail \n     operations should be set aside for each State that has not \n     had Amtrak service in such State for the preceding year.\n                                 ______\n\n\n                BINGAMAN (AND OTHERS) AMENDMENT NO. 4026\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI (for Mr. Bingaman, for himself, Ms. Snowe, and Mr. \nCohen) proposed an amendment to Senate Concurrent Resolution 57, supra; \nas follows:\n\n       At the end of title III, add the following:\n\n     SEC.   . SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING THE ECONOMIC \n                   DEVELOPMENT ADMINISTRATION PLACING HIGH \n                   PRIORITY ON MAINTAINING FIELD-BASED ECONOMIC \n                   DEVELOPMENT REPRESENTATIVES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate makes the following findings:\n       (1) The Economic Development Administration plays a crucial \n     role in helping economically disadvantaged regions of the \n     United States develop infrastructure that supports and \n     promotes greater economic activity and growth, particularly \n     in nonurban regions.\n       (2) The Economic Development Administration helps to \n     promote industrial park development, business incubators, \n     water and sewer system improvements, vocational and technical \n     training facilities, tourism development strategies, \n     technical assistance and capacity building for local \n     governments, economic adjustment strategies, revolving loan \n     funds, and other projects which the private sector has not \n     generated or will not generate without some assistance from \n     the Government through the Economic Development \n     Administration.\n       (3) The Economic Development Administration maintains 6 \n     regional offices which oversee staff that are designated \n     field-based representatives of the Economic Development \n     Administration, and these field-based representatives provide \n     valuable expertise and counseling on economic planning and \n     development to nonurban communities.\n       (4) The Economic Development Administration Regional \n     Centers are located in the urban areas of Austin, Seattle, \n     Denver, Atlanta, Philadelphia, and Chicago.\n       (5) Because of a 37-percent reduction in approved funding \n     for salaries and expenses from fiscal year 1995, the Economic \n     Development Administration has initiated staff reductions \n     requiring the elimination of 8 field-based positions. The \n     field-based economic development representative positions \n     that are either being eliminated or not replaced after \n     voluntary retirement and which currently interact with \n     nonurban communities on economic development efforts cover \n     the States of New Mexico, Arizona, Nevada, North Dakota, \n     Oklahoma, Illinois, Indiana, Maine, Connecticut, Rhode \n     Island, and North Carolina.\n       (6) These staff cutbacks will adversely affect States with \n     very low per-capita personal income, including New Mexico \n     which ranks 47th in the Nation in per-capita personal income, \n     Oklahoma ranking 46th, North Dakota ranking 42nd, Arizona \n     ranking 35th, Maine ranking 34th, and North Carolina ranking \n     33rd.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that the functional totals and reconciliations instructions \n     underlying this budget resolution assume that--\n       (1) it is regrettable that the Economic Development \n     Administration has elected to reduce field-based economic \n     development representatives who are fulfilling the Economic \n     Development Administration's mission of interacting with and \n     counseling nonurban communities in economically disadvantaged \n     regions of the United States;\n       (2) the Economic Development Administration should take all \n     necessary and appropriate actions to ensure that field-based \n     economic development representation receives high priority; \n     and\n       (3) the Economic Development Administration should \n     reconsider the planned termination of field-based economic \n     development representatives responsible for States that are \n     economically disadvantaged, and that this reconsideration \n     take place without delay.\n                                 ______\n\n\n                      DOMENICI AMENDMENT NO. 4027\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI proposed an amendment to amendment No. 4012 proposed by

Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to Manchester, \nNH, on its 150th anniversary. On June 8, the 100,000 residents of \nManchester will hold a community wide picnic to celebrate this \nsignificant milestone.\n  Manchester's 150 year heritage encompasses periods of growth and \nchange including native American occupation, colonial settlement, \nindustrial growth, and 20th century diversification. For over 10,000 \nyears various native American groups occupied what was then known as \nthe Merrimack River Valley. The abundance of fish and game in this area \nhelped support these people's livelihood. By 1725, most of the native \nAmericans inhabiting the Merrimack Valley had fled northward to escape \nconflict and disease brought about by European settlers that had \nmigrated into the area.\n  In the early 1700's, many European settlers began to move into the \nManchester area. Scottish and Irish families with expertise in flax \nspinning and weaving were the first group to settle around what is now \nknown as Londonderry in 1719. In 1722, John Goffe also established the \ntown's first water-powered mill along Cohas Brook. In 1751, the town of \nDerryfield, now known as Manchester, was established.\n  In the 1790's a man by the name of Samuel Blodget envisioned an \nindustrialized Derryfield which could boast open trade routes with \nBoston to the south and Concord to the north. Consequently, he \nproceeded to fund the development of a canal and lock system around the \nAmoskeag Falls. In 1810, 3 years after Blodget's death, the residents \nof Derryfield voted to change\n\n[[Page S5453]]\n\ntheir town's name to Manchester to honor Blodget's prediction that ``a \ncity like unto Manchester, England'' would rise because of the \nwaterpower at the falls.\n  In 1831, a group of investors known as Boston Associates began \nmanufacturing textiles by purchasing the rights to the water power at \nthe falls and developing a plan for a major complex of mills. The \nexecution of this plan helped foster 100 years of growth and expansion \nas the Amoskeag Manufacturing Co., became the largest textile producer \nin the world. At its peak, Amoskeag employed 17,000 workers and had \nover 30 major mills.\n  In March of 1936 Manchester experienced a disastrous flood which \ncompletely devastated the city. The determined citizens of Manchester \nbanded together to organize Amoskeag Industries and purchased the mill \ncomplex to help rebuild Manchester. The rebuilding of Manchester gave \nrise to a more diversified industrial base and the emergence of a \nstrong service economy. Through the unyielding support of Manchester's \ncitizens, local government, and banks, the local economy was slowly \nreborn. The complex of mills that still stand along the Merrimack are a \nreminder of how Manchester once flourished in the textile industry. The \ncitizens of Manchester still have the Yankee ingenuity and commitment \nto growth and industry.\n  Manchester's largest employers are now hospitals, universities, and \ntechnology companies. Manchester boasts a strong service and \nprofessional economy and is the largest city in New Hampshire. A \ncombination of natural and historical spots are being developed for a \npotential tourism industry. The New Hampshire Heritage Trail is one of \nthe major statewide projects. Additionally, many residents and visitors \nenjoy the Currier Gallery, the 883 seat Palace Theater and the \nZimmerman House. These historical spots and others are quickly giving \nManchester the reputation as the cultural center of the State.\n  The citizens of Manchester will have much to celebrate on June 8. \nAmong other highlights, the birthday bash will include a 150-foot-long \nbirthday cake, sand sculptures, softball tournaments, classic car \nshows, and even a laser-light show. The Historical Association will \nsponsor a kite-flying contest and the high school jazz and concert \nbands will perform along with the Jack Jackson Big Band. The day \npromises to be quite festive as many people in Manchester join in \ncelebrating the history of the Queen City.\n  It is my honor to represent such a successful and thriving city in \nthe U.S. Senate. I congratulate Manchester on the memorable occasion of \nits 150th birthday and wish the many residents of the city an exciting \nbirthday celebration.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/05/21/senate-section/article/S5452-3", "month": "05", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "21", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5453]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                THE VERMONT TEEN PARENT LITERACY PROJECT\n\n   Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I would like to take this \nopportunity to call attention to a unique project developed by the \nVermont Council on the Humanities that was recently honored at a White \nHouse ceremony as one of the best arts and humanities programs to help \nat-risk youth in this country. The teen parent literacy project is \nsimple in concept, yet it is an innovative approach to tackling complex \nproblems that can often result from teenagers having children. Through \nparticipating in a series of free reading and discussion programs, teen \nparents across the State are encouraged to read to their children. This \nprogram benefits parents and children in several ways. First, parents \nlearn the value and joy of reading to their children who are in turn, \nintroduced to the importance of reading. Reading to children at home \nhas proven to influence future educational success and bringing \ntogether teen parents and their children can help to cultivate a more \ncomfortable relationship as teen parents learn to become their \nchildren's first teacher.\n  The teen parent literacy project has brought together members of \nVermont communities who are dedicated to making this program a success \nfor teen parents and their children. Under the leadership of Victor \nSwenson, the Vermont Council on the Humanities is working with the \nVermont Department of Health, local libraries, and individuals from \neach district. It is no surprise that this program was selected as one \nof the very finest programs designed to improve the plight of at-risk-\nyouth. Teaching parents to read to their children enables us to forge \nahead as a literate nation. It demonstrates a commitment to our \ninvestment in our children and also in their parents, many still \nchildren themselves.\n  For many young parents in Vermont and throughout the United States, \nraising children is often met by insurmountable barriers and this \nprogram, supported by the National Endowment for the Humanities, will \nhelp them to overcome some of those hurdles. I am extremely proud of \nthe members of the council and the participants of the program who have \nmade this program a success.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/05/21/senate-section/article/S5453-1", "month": "05", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "21", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5453]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 HONORING FBI SPECIAL AGENT ROY JOHNSON\n\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today to honor a brave warrior in \nthe fight against child abduction. Special Agent Roy Johnson of the \nDetroit FBI Field Office is being honored today by the National Center \nfor Missing and Exploited Children (NCMEC) for his heroic efforts in \nrescuing Adam and Eleazar Alvarado, aged 11 and 3, from their \nabductors.\n  Adam and Eleazar are the children of migrant farm workers from \nMission, TX. They were abducted in Benton Harbor, MI, on October 14, \n1995. The boys had walked to a grocery store to buy potato chips while \ntheir mother was washing clothes in a nearby laundromat. They were \nabducted by Boyd Dean Weekly, a convicted child molester then out on \nbail on charges involving the sexual abuse of an 8 year old girl.\n  Less than 10 days later Special Agent Johnson recovered the Alvarado \nchildren and arrested their abductor. Johnson accomplished this amazing \nfeat by responding quickly and decisively to news of the abduction. He \nrequested that NCMEC broadcast fax posters--in English and Spanish--of \nthe missing children to all law enforcement agencies. Expeditiously \nsearching out and following up on a number of leads and sightings, he \nconcluded that the abductor was taking the children south. Special \nAgent Johnson then quickly and tirelessly disseminated information to \nall FBI field offices in the Southern United States. These efforts \nproduced leads concerning possible sightings in Alabama, and it was \nconcluded that Weekly was headed toward New Orleans. An FBI team set up \nsurveillance in New Orleans' French Quarter. Soon thereafter the agents \nobserved and arrested Weekly, who was driving a stolen car with the \nmissing children in it.\n\n  Special Agent Johnson's hard work, working with numerous offices and \nagencies, tirelessly following leads, disseminating information, and \ncoordinating efforts, should inspire us all. His example shows that \nchildren abducted by strangers can be recovered safely if the response \nfrom law enforcement officers is swift, efficient, and thorough. I \nwould like to congratulate him on a job well done, the other three law \nenforcement officers being honored by NCMEC for their extraordinary \nservice resulting in the recovery of missing children, and NCMEC for \nits continuing, important efforts on behalf of children.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/05/21/senate-section/article/S5453-2", "month": "05", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "21", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5453-S5454]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            TRIBUTE TO OUTSTANDING GIRL SCOUTS IN LOUISIANA\n\n Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, today I would like to salute 10 \noutstanding young women who have been honored with the Girl Scout Gold \nAward by the Girl Scout Council of Southeast Louisiana. They are: \nMelanie Adams of New Orleans, Lesley Cady of Chalmette, Patricia \nClaverie of Avondale, Carol Cancienne of River Ridge, Janet Cummins of \nMetairie, Pamela James of New Orleans, Michelle O'Flynn of Metairie, \nAngie Raborn of Roseland, Jennifer Reites of Metairie, Jennifer \nSchiffman of New Orleans.\n  The Girl Scout Gold Award is the highest honor in U.S. Girl Scouting. \nIt symbolizes outstanding accomplishments in the areas of leadership, \ncommunity service, career planning and personal development.\n  To receive the award, a Girl Scout must earn four interest project \npatches, the Career Exploration pin, the Senior Girl Scout Leadership \nAward, and\n\n[[Page S5454]]\n\nthe Senior Girl Scout Challenge, as well as design and implement a Girl \nScout Gold Award service project. A plan for fulfilling these \nrequirements is created by the Senior Girl Scout and is carried out \nthrough close cooperation between the girl and an adult Girl Scout \nvolunteer.\n  The named Girl Scouts provided the following community services for \ntheir Gold Award projects:\n  Miss Cady completed a beautification project involving landscaping \nand painting at Carolyn Park Elementary School.\n  Miss Claverie produced an extensive resource guide for recycled \ncrafts and environmental awareness.\n  Miss Cancienne developed a resource booklet on disability awareness \nincluding an activities box.\n  Miss James founded a chapter of Students Against Drunk Driving (SADD) \nat Benjamin Franklin High School.\n  Miss O'Flynn designed an equestrian competition for disabled \nchildren.\n  Miss Raborn educated her community about exchange student programs \nand her family hosted two exchange students.\n  Misses Adams, Cummins, Reites and Schiffman were a team for a \nrestoration project of Storyland at City Park.\n  I believe these Girl Scouts should receive the public recognition due \nthem for their significant services to their communities and to their \ncountry.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/05/21/senate-section/article/S5453-3", "month": "05", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "21", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5454]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          UNNATURAL CONDITIONS SET STAGE FOR NATURAL DISASTER\n\n Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I ask that the following newspaper \narticle be printed in the Congressional Record.\n  The article follows:\n\n          Unnatural Conditions Set Stage for Natural Disaster\n\n                    [From the Tribune, May 17, 1996]\n\n                            (By Sherry Boss)\n\n       Flagstaff--Peter Fule walks through the past and finds \n     comfort there.\n       He is safe in a stand of 400-year-old ponderosas. Wildfire \n     is unlikely to touch this 8 acres of forest north of \n     Flagstaff. Fule and his colleagues have restored it to the \n     way it was in 1876 in hopes of learning a lesson.\n       The wind is gusty here and rain a stranger--perfect \n     conditions for a sweeping blaze like the one that ravaged \n     61,000 acres at Four Peaks this month.\n       But unlike most of Arizona's forests this one is not a \n     tinderbox at the mercy of a cigarette butt or car engine \n     spark, said Fule, a senior research specialist at Northern \n     Arizona University's School of Forestry.\n       The grass under Fule's feet and the ample distance between \n     trees in peace of mind.\n       One day in 1994, students and employees for NAU, the U.S. \n     Forest Service and the logging industry sawed down more than \n     7,000 new trees in the Fort Valley Experimental Forest, short \n     eight miles north of Flagstaff. All that remains now are the \n     480 pines that were standing in pre-settlement days. Workers \n     brought the density down from more than 1,000 trees per acre \n     to 62--closer to the way it was before cattle disturbed the \n     forest's ecosystem.\n       ``It was a neat feeling to see this being done and see the \n     new forest emerging,'' Fule said.\n       If lightning were strike here now, short flames would creep \n     along the forest floor. The fire would consume grass, twigs \n     and pine needle litter. The flames would singe tree trunks, \n     but wouldn't get hot enough to kill the towering pines. Then, \n     when there was no grass left to burn, the flames would go \n     out.\n       That's the way it was for hundreds of years. Fire was \n     friendly to the forest, Fule said. It cleared out scraggly \n     brush and new saplings every few years, allowing the older \n     trees to thrive without competition for water and light.\n       But this is the forest of the past.\n       Today, national forests like Arizona's Coconino, Kaibab and \n     Apache-Sitgreaves are much different places. They're so dense \n     with spindly young pines, forestry experts call the cluster \n     of trees ``dog-hair ticktets.''\n       Fire in those tickets equals almost certain destruction. \n     The trees of different sizes form stair steps for the fire to \n     climb to the largest pines.\n       That's why, forestry experts say, Arizona is at risk of the \n     worst wildfires this millenium.\n       Never before has there been such accumulation of fire fuel. \n     Add to that some of the driest weather in recorded history \n     and the danger is extreme.\n       Years of ecological disturbance have brought the West's \n     forests to this point, Fule said.\n       The trouble started in Arizona in 1883 when the \n     transcontinental railroad was finished. The state was \n     connected. People arrived. They brought cows.\n       The lush grass and wildflowers on the forest floors were \n     perfect for grazing. Cows ate to the bare ground.\n       With the grass gone, the fires stopped. When pines dropped \n     their seeds, they took root. The trees grew in thick, but not \n     very big. There wasn't enough water for any one tree to \n     thrive. Now, when a spark hits the thickets, the world forest \n     is doomed.\n       ``If a fire came through this year, this tree would almost \n     certainly die,'' Fule said of a ponderosa that has stood for \n     at least 300 years. ``Not only this one, but all its \n     neighbors.''\n       What took hundreds of years for nature to build could be \n     destroyed in minutes, he said.\n       For most of this century, the U.S. Forest Service's policy \n     was to put out fires. Fule said. That policy interrupted \n     nature's long-term plans, he said.\n       ``People have always wanted to control nature and remake it \n     for human needs and human goals,'' he said.\n       Years of fire suppression policy led to the devastating \n     Lone fire at four Peaks 35 miles east of Phoenix, said Julie \n     Stromberg, associate research professor at Arizona State \n     University's Center for Environmental Studies. Fires have \n     been put out as soon as they start, allowing the vegetation \n     to accumulate.\n       ``If you don't do frequent burns or controlled burns, \n     you're going to have a catastrophic fire,'' Stromberg said.\n       The problem isn't easily solved now. It's too late to let \n     nature take its course, Fule said. There's no choice but to \n     put out forest fires, he said.\n       ``If all the fire crews walked away, by tomorrow, the whole \n     state would be in flames,'' he said.\n       Fule hopes the solution lies in a combination of cutting \n     and burning.\n       Official will start a fire every three years in the \n     cleared-out experimental forest to imitate the natural fire \n     cycle that occurred between 1630 and 1876.\n       A similar cut-and-burn project is under way on a larger \n     scale at Mount Turmbull on 3,700 acres north of the Grand \n     Canyon.\n       But thinning out the forest is controversial. Some people \n     are so accustomed to thick forests, they believe that's the \n     way they should be. Some are partial to the kinds of wildlife \n     the thickets attract, too.\n       But as the Lone fire proved, nature has a vengeance when \n     it's disturbed.\n       ``The natural area (becomes) so unnatural in its density \n     and fuel accumulation, it begins to present a hazard,'' Fule \n     said.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/05/21/senate-section/article/S5454-1", "month": "05", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "21", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5454-S5456]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  CELEBRATING THE LIFE OF DICK CLURMAN\n\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, yesterday morning, May 20, 1996, ``a \ngathering to celebrate the life of Dick Clurman'' took place at the \nBeth-El Chapel of the Temple Emanu-El in New York City. William F. \nBuckley, Jr. led off with a wonderfully moving tribute, which ended, \n``It will require the balance of my own lifetime to requite what he \ngave to me.'' He was followed by Osborn Elliott, a lifelong friend and \nfellow journalist. There followed equally singular tributes from Harry \nEvans, H.D.S. Greenway, David Halberstam, Phyllis Newman, who sang a \nGershwin tune, Hugh Sidey, Mike Wallace, Barbara Walters, and then the \nClurman family. Rabbi Richard S. Chapin and Cantor Howard Nevison \nprovided liturgy and liturgical music.\n  It was indeed a life to celebrate and to remember. I ask that Mr. \nBuckley's and Mr. Elliott's remarks be printed in the Record, along \nwith a fine obituary by Lawrence Van Gelder which appeared in the New \nYork Times.\n  The material follows:\n\n Remarks by Wm. F. Buckley, Jr. at the Memorial Service for Richard M. \n                                Clurman\n\n       Three years ago, one evening in July, he asked whether I'd \n     cross the ocean again in 1995, what would have been the fifth \n     such venture, done at five-year intervals beginning in 1975. \n     ``I'm prepared to go,'' he told me. I suppose I smiled; it \n     was dark on the veranda when he spoke. I told him I doubted \n     my crew could be mobilized for one more such trip, and just \n     the right crew was indispensable. He had done with me two \n     Atlantic crossings, one Pacific crossing. He was an instant \n     celebrity for his ineptitudes at sea, done in high spirit \n     with a wonderful, persistent incomprehension of what was the \n     job at hand. He was the object of hilarious ridicule in my \n     son's published journal--and he loved it all, even as \n     Christopher loved him; even when, while discoursing \n     concentratedly on matters of state, he would drop his \n     cigarette ash into Christopher's wine glass, or very nearly \n     set fire in the galley when trying to light the stove. He \n     thrived on the cheerful raillery of his companions, but on \n     one occasion thought to say to me, in a voice unaccustomedly \n     low, ``I'm good at other things.''\n       He hardly needed to remind me. Yes, and from everything he \n     was good at he drew lessons, little maxims of professional \n     and extra-professional life of great cumulative impact, \n     instantly imparted to all his friends, at the least \n     suggestion from them, or from their situation, that they \n     needed help, or instruction. It is awesome to extrapolate \n     from one's own experience of his goodness the sum of what he \n     did for others.\n       When Oz Elliott, on Shirley's behalf, asked me to say \n     something today I went right to my desk but I found it \n     impossible to imagine his absence from the scene. Was it true \n     that there would be no message from him tomorrow on our E-\n     mail circuit? That we would\n\n[[Page S5455]]\n\n     not be dining together during the week, or sharing a tenth \n     Christmas together? In the strangest sense, the answer is No, \n     it isn't impossible that we will continue as companions, \n     because his companionship left indelible traces: how to work, \n     how to read, how to love.\n       It came to me last Thursday when just after midnight my son \n     reached me at the hotel, that I have always subconsciously \n     looked out for the total Christian, and when I found him, he \n     turned out to be a non-practicing Jew. It will require the \n     balance of my own lifetime to requite what he gave to me.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n                                  Dick\n\n       Good morning, Shirley, and Michael, and Susan Emma, and \n     Carol, and all you other family members and hundreds of \n     friends who are here to rejoice in the life of that wonderful \n     man, Dick Clurman.\n       I'm Oz Elliott, and Dick was my best friend.\n       We were close for nearly half a century.\n       At first, we had no choice: as young writers for Time, we \n     were thrown together, crammed with our Royal typewriters into \n     a tiny cubbyhole at 9 Rockefeller Plaza.\n       Within a year or so, we graduated to offices of our own--\n     but by then there was no way we could really be separated. \n     The reason was that while Dick made himself an expert in many \n     things, his true specialty was friendship--and that came so \n     naturally to him.\n       Once you were his friend, you could do no wrong. Once you \n     were his friend, he could never do enough for you.\n       If you were stranded in the suburbs by a hurricane, and \n     unable to visit your sick baby in a New York hospital, not to \n     worry: Dick would visit that baby and report to you daily.\n       If you were in a panic because your child was late coming \n     home on a dark winter evening, Dick would be there in a flash \n     to search the neighborhood.\n       If you were fired from your job in mid-career, Dick would \n     find you a new one.\n       If you suffered from writer's block, Dick would help you \n     write a lead.\n       Dick did all these things, most of them for me.\n       In later years, we were fierce competitors--he stayed at \n     Time, while I moved to Newsweek. Yet even in that head-to-\n     head combat, whenever I faced a tough ethical decision, I \n     would always call Dick for advice.\n       He was a superb journalist--ever the skeptic, never the \n     cynic, always a stickler for precision.\n       One summer dawn we were out fishing together--and to our \n     utter amazement we spotted a baby seal in Westhampton waters. \n     Dick got on the ship-to-shore right away:\n       ``Coast Guard, Coast Guard, this is Sundance. Over.''\n       ``Coast Guard, Coast Guard, this is Sundance. Over.''\n       After repeated calls, some sleepy Coast Guardsman answered:\n       ``Sundance this is Coast Guard. Over.''\n       ``Coast Guard, we have located a seal--that's a Sugar-Easy-\n     Able-Love,'' said Dick. ``Is that of any interest to you?''\n       ``A what?\n       ``That's a seal,'' Dick said, ``a Sugar--Easy--Able--\n     Love.''\n       ``You mean the animal?'' asked the bewildered Coast \n     Guardsman.\n       ``That's the mammal,'' Dick responded.\n       He was precise, and caring, and incredibly well organized. \n     The other day, as some of us were helping Shirley--manning \n     the phones, calling friends, informing the press, planning \n     this morning's service, Michael said it all:\n       ``Where is Dick Clurman when we need him most?''\n       My best friend.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n                [From the New York Times, May 17, 1996]\n\n        Richard M. Clurman, a Leading Editor at Time, Dies at 72\n\n                        (By Lawrence Van Gelder)\n\n       Richard M. Clurman, whose passion for journalism brought \n     him to prominence at Time magazine and Newsday and whose \n     passion for New York City made him a leading figure in its \n     cultural affairs, died on Wednesday at his summer home in \n     Quogue, L.I. Mr. Clurman, who lived on the Upper East Side of \n     Manhattan, was 72.\n       The cause was a heart attack, according to his wife, \n     Shirley.\n       In a career at Time that spanned 23 years, Mr. Clurman held \n     such posts as press editor, chief of correspondents and head \n     of the Time-Life News Service, overseeing a network of 105 \n     staff correspondents deployed throughout the United States \n     and in 34 cities abroad.\n       From 1955 to 1958, he interrupted his tenure at Time, which \n     began in 1949 and ended in 1972, to become the editorial \n     director and executive assistant to Alicia Patterson, the \n     publisher of Newsday.\n       In 1973, he became administrator of Parks, Recreation and \n     Cultural Affairs for Mayor John V. Lindsay. Mr. Clurman was \n     also chairman of the New York City Center and a member of the \n     board of Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts.\n       His commitment to journalism and his fascination with its \n     practices and lore led him to write several books, including \n     ``Beyond Malice: The Media's Years of Reckoning,'' a 1988 \n     analysis of the clash between the public and the press, and \n     ``To the End of Time: The Seduction and Conquest of the \n     World's Largest Media Empires,'' a 1992 account of the merger \n     between Time Inc. and Warner Communications.\n       Toward the end of the book, Mr. Clurman wondered if Time's \n     objective of adding ``to the quality of knowledge people had \n     about the world'' would survive what he called the cultural \n     gap between the corporations.\n       ``No one should ask that benevolence be the priority of \n     Time Warner or any other public company,'' he wrote. ``What \n     can be asked is that this new company, with its human and \n     material assets, have a spine that is more than stocks, \n     bonds, rights, deals and tightly rolled greenbacks.''\n       At the time is his death, Mr. Clurman was at work on a book \n     about The Wall Street Journal.\n       As sophisticated and accomplished as he was in journalism, \n     Mr. Clurman adopted a self-deprecating attitude toward his \n     activities in other realms. When named board chairman of the \n     New York City Center of Music and Drama in 1968, Mr. Clurman \n     said; ``The suggestion came out of the blue. For 44 years \n     I've done nothing outside of journalism. I haven't even \n     belonged to the P.T.A. or the Red Cross.\n       ``At first I thought they were seeking my advice about \n     someone else and then I thought they'd confused me with \n     Harold,'' he said, referring to his uncle, the critic and \n     director Harold Clurman. ``I am neither an impresario nor a \n     tycoon, and impresarios and tycoons are often the moving \n     spirit behind cultural organizations of this sort.''\n       But within a few years, he was being credited with \n     expanding the activities of the City Center.\n       Mayor Lindsay, who was president of the center and leader \n     of its selection committee, clearly valued the fresh eye Mr. \n     Clurman brought to the center and to his post as Parks \n     Commissioner.\n       There, Mr. Clurman touched off an immediate furor by \n     declaring at his swearing-in ceremony that he would withdraw \n     all maintenance and services from parks that were \n     repeatedly vandalized and where the community made no \n     effort to halt the destruction.\n       He took pride in coming in the inner workings of the city \n     as an outsider unwise to the way to political patronage.\n       ``In the world I came from, I had only dispensed jobs on \n     merit,'' he wrote in 1974 in the New York Times. ``So I set \n     about hiring, firing and moving people on the basis of what I \n     thought the parks administration needed. Mr. Lindsay was so \n     bemused by my political innocence that neither he nor his \n     staff ever suggested I do it any other way. The club house \n     politicians, whose names I eventually learned but from whom I \n     never heard a word, either considered me so ignorant or so \n     temporary as to be unworthy of their presumed power.''\n       In another article, he recalled his introduction to George \n     Balanchine and Lincoln Kirstein of the New York City Ballet \n     in his capacity as chairman of the board of the ballet \n     company and its parent organization, the New York City Center \n     of Music and Drama.\n       ``I informed them that although I appreciated the other \n     arts and was certainly informed about world affairs, I had \n     been to the ballet only once in my life,'' he wrote. \n     ``Balanchine half rose from his chair and asked \n     incredulously, `Do you hate the ballet?'\n       `` `Not that I'm aware of,' I replied, `but if I were you, \n     I'd make something of how seldom I've gone.' ''\n       Balanchine asked, ``Would you open your mind to learning \n     about the ballet?'' and, Mr. Clurman wrote, ``promptly made \n     an offer that only a dolt could refuse: `I would like to \n     teach you about it.' ''\n       Mr. Clurman suggested that he prescribe a bibliography and \n     a list of people to talk to, his usual mode of inquiry and \n     learning as a journalist. ``No, just watch and listen,'' \n     Balanchine said. He produced a program and listed seven or \n     eight ballets. For six weeks, Mr. Clurman said, he tried to \n     figure out what was going on.\n       ``Then one night in the middle of Balanchine's pioneering \n     `Agon,' I had the epiphany that my teacher had so artfully \n     arranged. Nothing was going on. It was just bodies moving \n     gloriously to music. From that moment, the ballet became my \n     favorite spectator experience.''\n       In 1975, after he left Time and municipal administration, \n     Mr. Clurman formed his own public policy consulting company, \n     Richard M. Clurman Associates. From 1980 to 1984, he also \n     served as adviser to the office of the chairman of Joseph E. \n     Seagram & Sons. In 1981, he returned to journalism, serving \n     for a decade as the chairman of Columbia University's \n     seminars on media and society.\n       Engaged with ideas, Mr. Clurman was noted for dinner \n     parties at which he would tap a spoon against a glass, \n     commanding the attention of his guests--people like Robert F. \n     Kennedy, William Buckley, Edward Albee, Barbra Streisand and \n     Norman Podhoretz--and announce a topic they were expected to \n     discuss.\n       ``I refused to be bored,'' he said.\n       Mr. Clurman was a member of the Council on Foreign \n     Relations and of the board of the Citizens Committee for New \n     York City.\n       He was born in New York City in 1924. He received a \n     Bachelor's of Philosophy degree in political science from the \n     University of Chicago in 1946 after serving during World War \n     II in the Information and Education Division of the Army. He \n     began his career in journalism in 1946 as an assistant editor \n     on the magazine Commentary. After joining Time in 1949, he \n     served for six years as its press editor.\n       In addition to his wife, the former Shirley Potash, Mr. \n     Clurman is survived by his son,\n\n[[Page S5456]]\n\n     R.

Mr. President, I wanted to take a few moments today \nto speak about the passing of a distinguished citizen of Connecticut \nand a great American--Henry Healey, Jr.\n  At the time of his death, Henry Healey was the high sheriff of New \nHaven County. But his legacy was far greater. He was a WWII veteran, a \nsuccessful businessman, a dedicated member of the Democratic Party, and \na close and dear friend.\n  I first got to know Henry Healey because of his relationship with my \nfather, Senator Thomas Dodd. And later, when I decided to leave the \nHouse of Representatives and make my own run for the U.S. Senate it was \nfrom Henry Healey that I sought counsel.\n  His advice then, as it was every time I spoke to him, helped to guide \nme in my decision-making process. Because, Henry was a man of great \nwisdom and shrewd understanding of political history.\n  Like few men I've known, Henry was endowed with a vision that allowed \nhim to presciently see beyond the political machinations of the day to \nthe long-term political currents of the future.\n  It's one of the main reasons why Henry was probably one of the three \nor four most influential people in the past 30 years of Connecticut \npolitical history.\n  But of course there was more to Henry then just his political acumen. \nHe was a man of great loyalty and understanding, who knew how to \naccomplish things without being flamboyant or self-serving.\n  He wasn't a great ideologue or a firebrand. He was more interested in \npeople's human skills and their ability to work with others.\n  I think his chief deputy sheriff, Frank Kinney, Jr., said it best: \n``People with problems in their lives could always open up to him and \nhe never failed to respond, to do what he could for them. That's what I \nlearned from him, and that's what I admired most about him.''\n  And in his official role as New Haven County sheriff, Henry Healey \nturned what had been a largely administrative position into a bully \npulpit for drug education, crime prevention, and charity.\n  And he was recognized across the country for his innovations in law \nenforcement. He was one of the first officials in America to advocate \nneighborhood block watch programs. He was a strong voice in the fight \nagainst substance abuse in New Haven County schools. And he was \nrecognized by his peers, when he was appointed president of the \nNational Sheriffs Association, in the late 1980s.\n  But, Henry Healey was also a man of great personal charity. His New \nHaven scholarship fund helped give hundreds of Connecticut children the \nopportunity to seek higher education. And, he made it a regular \npractice of hiring ex-convicts for his car dealerships. In addition, he \nended the practice of serving eviction notices at Christmas.\n  This charity was certainly smart politics for an elected official. It \nwas no accident that if you had hopes of a career in politics in \nConnecticut, it was a good idea to stay on the right side of Henry.\n  But, it also reflected Henry's integrity as a public servant and as a \nman. He was a throwback to an earlier, simpler age in American politics \nand he will be dearly missed by the residents of New Haven County and \nthe State of Connecticut.\n  My thoughts and prayers are with his wife Jean and his children \nPatrick, Henry Bryan, Michael, Constance, Christina, and Irene.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/05/21/senate-section/article/S5456-1", "month": "05", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "21", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5456]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   ADJUSTING THE CONSUMER PRICE INDEX\n\n Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, a number of careful statements \nhave been made on the floor yesterday and today concerning the use of \nthe Consumer Price Index [CPI] as a proxy for measuring changes in the \ncost of living. As we all surely know, the Bureau of Labor Statistics \n[BLS] is insistent that the CPI is not a cost of living index: never \nhas been; cannot be. It would be more than a third of a century ago \nthat I became Assistant Secretary of Labor in the Kennedy \nadministration. In that role, I had nominal supervision of the Bureau, \nand I attest that this was fully understood at that time, well before \nthe CPI began to be used as it is today as an index for various \nentitlement programs and tax schedules.\n  The question has been properly raised as to whether economists are in \ngeneral agreement that the CPI overstates inflation. My distinguished \nfriend from North Dakota, Senator Conrad, described the near unanimous \ntestimony of a panel of economists that testified before the Senate \nCommittee on Finance to this effect. I would draw the attention of the \nSenate to the fact that well before the Finance Committee established \nthe Boskin commission to enquire into this matter, the subject was \nunder consideration in the Office of Management and Budget. \nSpecifically, a memorandum of October 3, 1994, sets forth the matter in \nspecific terms.\n  I ask that portions of that memorandum be printed in the Record.\n  The material follows:\n                                                  October 3, 1994.\n     From: Alice M. Rivlin.\n     Subject: Big Choices.\n       When we met in August, we noted that it was time for a \n     serious discussion of the budget and economic agenda for 1995 \n     and 1996. Decisions must be made soon about the policies to \n     be articulated in the FY 1996 budget, the State of the Union, \n     and our response to the Kerrey-Danforth Commission report. \n     These policies and the message they contain are crucial to \n     the record we will run on in 1996.\n\n                    Illustrative entitlement options\n\n\n        Options                                      5-yr savings (S B)\nCOLA reduction:\n    CPI minus 0.5 ``technical'' reform (CPI may be overstated by 0.4% \n      to 1.5%).......................................................33\n    Eliminate COLAs for one year.....................................55\n109 2 for five years.........................................\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/05/21/senate-section/article/S5456-2", "month": "05", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "21", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5456-S5457]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 THE VOID IN MORAL LEADERSHIP--PART IX\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY.

This is a story of an abuse of power by the new \noccupants of the White House, back on May 19, 1993.\n  The Clinton White House used the full powers of the Federal \nGovernment to fire these seven loyal workers, destroy their \nreputations, deplete their bank accounts, steal their dignity, and \ncause great suffering for their families.\n  I wonder how many Americans have been the target of an abusive \nWashington bureaucracy--like the IRS.\n  Or how about when four Federal agencies fight over the right to tell \na farmer how to use land that his family has been farming for three \ngenerations.\n  And how many small businesses have been harassed by OSHA or EPA?\n  Untold numbers of citizens across this land have been harassed and \nabused by the Federal Government. Hard-working families try to play by \nthe rules. Next thing they know, they are unfair targets of zealous \nWashington bureaucrats who are out of control.\n  Mr. President, no hard-working, honest citizen should have to go \nthrough such an ordeal. It is unjust and unfair. Government is supposed \nto promote justice and fairness, but Washington turns these principles \nupside down.\n  There are many examples of bureaucracies harassing citizens; but \nthere are few examples of Washington putting the full force of its \npowers against decent, hard-working families. The case of the \nTravelgate Seven is one such example. For them, the harassment was many \ntimes greater than what most citizens have endured. These seven \nprovided a service for the President and the press corps in the \ninterest of open government. Their bosses were seven previous \nPresidents and the American taxpayers. But cronies of President \nClinton, infatuated with newly derived power, coveted the business for \nthemselves.\n\n  The only barriers to themselves and a lucrative business were these \nseven loyal workers, so the cronies went on the attack. First, they \nspread false allegations against the seven workers, accusing them of \nmismanagement and embezzlement. This led to their firings by the \nPresident.\n\n[[Page S5457]]\n\n  When there was a public backlash, the White House damage-control \noperation went into full gear. The White House publicly smeared the \nreputations of the workers with all the false charges. The workers and \ntheir families were publicly humiliated. Next, to justify the false \ncharges, the White House then unleashed the FBI and the IRS on them. \nFinally, the Justice Department prosecuted them on trumped up charges.\n  Nearly 3 years and hundreds of thousands of dollars later, a jury \nacquitted the fall guy and scapegoat of the White House offensive, \nBilly Dale. They acquitted him in less than 2 hours.\n  There can be no doubt that this case was a miscarriage of justice, no \ndoubt that these seven workers were unjustly and unfairly persecuted. \nAnd no doubt that the President made a mistake in firing them. Yet, the \nPresident has failed to own up. He has failed to take responsibility \nfor their firings and their continued harassment.\n  There is lots of finger-pointing and blaming going on at the White \nHouse, but no one will stand up and take responsibility for what \nhappened. That is usually the sign of failed moral leadership. The \nleader in the White House--the President--will not take responsibility \nfor the unwarranted firings at the behest of cronies and then, he will \nnot seek accountability for whoever unleashed the powers of the Federal \nGovernment to harass the Travelgate Seven.\n  Mr. President, is it unfair to ask the President to take \nresponsibility for his actions? Is it unfair to hold accountable those \nzealots on his staff that unjustly unleashed the FBI, the IRS, and the \nJustice Department on these innocent employees? Is it unfair that the \nPresident should admit that he made a serious mistake?\n  Instead of considering these questions, the President has sent his \nlieutenants out to again harass these former workers. The House of \nRepresentatives earlier this year voted overwhelmingly to provide legal \nexpenses for the Travelgate Seven. It had bipartisan support. But when \nthe bill came to the Senate, it was ambushed by Clinton loyalists. They \nwere afraid of the embarrassment it would cause the President to have \nto sign such a bill that would prove he had made a serious mistake. \nRather than face the music, the President sent out his lieutenants to \nblock the bill in the Senate. They succeeded. The minority leader \nsucceeded in using the Senate procedures to block consideration of the \nbill that would make these seven families economically whole, and put \nthe ordeal behind them--not psychologically whole, not their \nreputations whole, not their dignity whole, not their pain and \nsuffering whole, just their expenses--the least of what should be \nrestored.\n\n  The President's lieutenants--the Democrats in this body--shot the \nbill down. It was pure and simple legislative harassment. That was on \nMay 7. And so, the harassment continues. It is simply not right. It is \nnot fair. And they need to be held accountable.\n  Mr. President, is it fair for these Democrats to not do the right \nthing just to save the President from embarrassment? I will let the \nAmerican people answer that question. Perhaps they will call the office \nof their Senator.\n  Tell the Democrats to stop playing politics with the Billy Dale bill. \nAfter all, they voted 52 to 44 on May 7 to block the Billy Dale bill.\n  Mr. President, the bottom line of this story, and of the record of \nthis President, is the absence of moral leadership. A President--a \nleader--who fails to take responsibility for his actions; who allows \ncronies to run roughshod over innocent employees; who allows his staff \nto violate the civil rights of these workers; who lets his staff \nunleash the powers of the Federal Government against innocent families; \nwho fails to seek accountability for those who did the unleashing; and \nwho covers it all up by claiming executive privilege--in light of all \nthis, can we truly call this President a leader?\n  He has failed to set the proper example for the country. He has \nfailed to set an example for the people he serves--the American people. \nHe has failed to set an example for his own staff. And, he has failed \nto set an example for the seven fired workers and their families. \nRather than face the music, the President has his lieutenants do his \ndirty work in the darkness of night, and in the Democratic cloak room, \nall to avoid the embarrassment of his mistakes.\n  In the coming weeks, the Billy Dale bill will be brought to the floor \nagain--this bill to restore hope and dignity for these families. I call \nupon the American people to not allow this injustice to stand. Make the \nSenate Democrats do the right thing. Make them support the Billy Dale \nbill. This morning's Washington Post editorializes on this matter. The \neditorial is entitled, ``Another Travel Office Travesty.'' It says, get \npolitics out of the way and pass this bill. I agree, Mr. President. I \nurge my Democratic colleagues to get out of the way. I ask unanimous \nconsent that the Post editorial be printed in the Record and I yield \nthe floor.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the Washington Post, May 21, 1996]\n\n                     Another Travel Office Travesty\n\n       Why are some people in Congress maneuvering to keep that \n     institution from making right some of the wrongs done to \n     fired White House travel office employees? Nothing the \n     Congress can enact will make up for the damage done to the \n     reputations of these workers. But fooling with them the way \n     they are is simply wrong.\n       The travel office fiasco should have been resolved days \n     ago. Billy Dale and his six travel office colleagues were \n     summarily dismissed from their jobs in 1993 for the shakiest \n     of reasons. They were summarily told to vacate their offices \n     by the incoming Clinton White House and publicly smeared with \n     charges that they had engaged in wrongdoing. White House \n     staff that had an interest in taking over the travel office \n     even helped to concoct the allegations. The reputations of \n     the fired travel office employees were unfairly damaged, and \n     Mr. Dale in particular was made to undergo a painful and \n     costly ordeal before he was exonerated by a jury.\n       All of the fired employees incurred legal expenses in \n     connection with criminal probes launched against them \n     following their discharge. Mr. Dale bore $500,000, the lion's \n     share, but no ex-travel office employee escaped without a \n     crushing debt burden. The others incurred about $200,000 \n     themselves. So to undo at least some of the damage, \n     legislation was introduced in Congress to reimburse them for \n     some of the costs of defending themselves. The House passed \n     the bill by an overwhelming 350 to 43 vote. President Clinton \n     says he will sign it. Sen. Orrin Hatch has introduced the \n     bill in the Senate.\n       But Senate Democrats have been blocking action on the Hatch \n     measure because they want a vote on the minimum wage increase \n     and can't get one. To make matters worse, the Dale bill was \n     amended by Bob Dole to include the Republican gas-tax \n     repealer. Hence, Bill Dale et al. are now part of the \n     Senate's five-car pile-up, the rest of which includes the \n     minimum wage boost, gas tax cut, taxpayer bill of rights, and \n     the T.E.A.M. measure.\n       Mr. Dale and the former travel office employees, having \n     taken shots from the White House and lost much in the \n     process, are now caught in another political crossfire. The \n     people holding up action on the reimbursement of the misused \n     travel office employees should back off. The time has come to \n     rectify a wrong.\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/05/21/senate-section/article/S5456-3", "month": "05", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "21", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5457-S5458]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           EXECUTIVE SESSION\n\n                                 ______\n\n\n                           EXECUTIVE CALENDAR\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to the immediate consideration of calendar No. 384, S. 1624.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 1624) to reauthorize the Hate Crimes Statistics \n     Act, and for other purposes.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the immediate \nconsideration of the bill?\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I wish to express my appreciation to the \nSenate for its swift action in passing S. 1624, which permanently \nreauthorizes the Hate Crime Statistics Act.\n  The people of my State of Utah, and of all of our States, have a \nstake in this legislation, because any of our citizens can fall prey to \na hate crime. Every crime, of course, is a terrible event. But the hate \ncrime is of a particularly insidious nature. It splits the individual \nvictim apart from his or her neighbors and community. It isolates the \nvictim because of who he or she is. The hate crime emphasizes the \ndifferences, not as the strengths they are in this diverse country, but \nas a means of dividing American from American. It submerges the common \nhumanity of all peoples. All real Americans condemn these vile crimes \nwithout hesitation or reservation.\n  Under the Hate Crime Statistics Act, the Attorney General is required \nto collect data ``about crimes that manifest evidence of prejudice \nbased on race, religion, disability, sexual orientation, or ethnicity. \n. . .'' The act has resulted in the creation of a Federal data base on \nbias-motivated criminal acts. In addition, it has served as a catalyst \nfor an FBI effort to train State and local law enforcement officials \nabout hate crimes. Collection of this data can help alert local \ncommunities and their law enforcement agencies to any pattern of hate \ncrimes in their neighborhoods. It can also help spur educational \nefforts aimed at enhancing goodwill in our communities. The Hate Crime \nStatistics Act has proven its value, and has earned the permanent \nreauthorization that the Senate has now approved.\n  I wish to commend my friend and distinguished colleague, Senator \nSimon, for his work on this issue. Without his tireless efforts, there \nwould have been no Hate Crime Statistics Act of 1990, and no \nreauthorization of the act this year. I also wish to commend his chief \ncounsel, Susan Kaplan, for her work on this law over several years.\n  Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, I am pleased that today the Senate will \npass S. 1624, a bill to reauthorize and provide a permanent mandate for \nthe Hate Crimes Statistics Act. I would like to thank Chairman Hatch \nfor his leadership on this important issue, as well as my 51 colleagues \nwho cosponsored this measure. In addition to its strong bipartisan \nsupport in the Senate, this bill also has the strong support of \nAttorney General Reno, as well as the endorsement of major law \nenforcement and advocacy groups.\n  The Hate Crimes Statistics Act, which passed the Senate in 1990 by a \nvote of 92 to 4 and was signed into law by then President Bush, \nrequires the Justice Department to collect data on crimes that show \nevidence of prejudice based on race, religion, ethnicity, or sexual \norientation. Until this Act was passed, no Federal records of such \ncrimes were maintained. This lack of information made it difficult to \ndetermine whether a particular crime was an isolated incident, or part \nof a continuing series against a particular group.\n  The act has proven successful in its initial purpose--the creation of \ndata collection--and has also served as a catalyst for an FBI effort to \ntrain State and local law enforcement officials about hate crimes. \nHearings held before the Senate Judiciary Committee's Subcommittee on \nthe Constitution in 1992 and 1994 showed that one of the prime benefits \nof the act is that it has helped dramatically increase the awareness \nand sensitivity of the police about hate crimes. Not only do victims of \nhate crimes benefit from a more informed police force, but greater \npolice awareness encourages others to report hate crimes.\n  Since all data submission under the act is voluntary, we did not \nanticipate 100 percent participation by State and local law enforcement \nagencies from the start. Nonetheless, over the course of 4 years, there \nhas been great progress in participation levels. In 1991, 2,771 law \nenforcement agencies participated in the voluntary reporting program. \nIn 1994, more than 7,200 agencies participated. Local police, advocacy \ngroups, mayors, and others have joined the effort to encourage every \nlaw enforcement agency to comply, and as more and more local agencies \nparticipate, the statistics will be more and more useful to identify \ntrends and formulate responses. In addition, the FBI is in the process \nof working with States to upgrade their computer systems. When this \ntransition is complete, the data should be even more useful. \nUnfortunately, there are still law enforcement agencies in some States \nand many large cities which are not yet participating in the data \ncollection. We need active oversight of this act to ensure that these \nagencies join in this important effort, making the statistics more \naccurate and useful.\n  FBI Director Louis Freeh has stated that he is committed to the \ncontinued tracking of hate crimes statistics. However, we believe that \nthis effort has proven its usefulness and deserves a permanent mandate. \nCollecting such data will not erase bigotry. It will, however, be a \nvaluable tool in the fight against prejudice.\n  Obviously, the FBI statistics do not yet accurately reflect the level \nof violence motivated by prejudice in our society. We need only read \nthe headlines and reports by advocacy groups to see how widespread the \nproblem of hate crimes remains in our Nation.\n  The Justice Department recently launched a civil rights probe into a \nrash of arson which has destroyed at least 23 black churches in the \nSouth since 1993. The Justice Department is trying to determine whether \nthe crimes are racially motivated, and whether they are connected. \nSeveral of the incidents have been solved, however, and clearly racism \nmotivated the offenders. The teenagers found guilty of burning a church \nin Mississippi in 1993 shouted racial epithets during commission of \ntheir crime. Racist graffiti was spray-painted on the walls of a \nKnoxville, TN Baptist church set afire on January 8, 1996. Sumter \nCounty Circuit Court Judge Eddie Hardaway, a black judge who sent two \nwhite men to jail for vandalizing black churches, was recently the \nvictim of a shotgun attack which shattered bedroom windows in his home. \nDuring the 1960's civil rights movement, many black churches were set \nablaze, however in the late 1980's and early 1990's only one or two \nsuch crimes were reported each year. This recent string of arson \nreminds us that prejudice and hate crimes remain a problem in our \nNation.\n  Recent reports by private groups, such as the Anti-Defamation League, \nthe National Coalition on Anti-Violence Projects, and the National \nAsian Pacific American Legal Consortium, confirm that unfortunately the \nproblem of crimes based on prejudice continues. The ADL's 1995 annual \naudit of\n\n[[Page S5459]]\n\nanti-Semitic incidents actually had some good news: the 1,843 anti-\nSemitic incidents reported to the Anti-Defamation League in 1995 \nrepresented a decrease of 223 incidents, or 11 percent, from the 1994 \ntotal of 2,066. This is the largest decline in 10 years. However, this \ngood news is tempered by the seriousness of many of the incidents \nreported. For the fifth straight year in a row, acts of anti-Semitic \nharassment against individuals outnumber incidents of vandalism against \ninstitutions and other property.\n  The National Coalition of Anti-Violence Projects and New York City \nGay and Lesbian Anti-Violence Project report similar findings for 1995. \nThere were fewer incidents of violence against homosexuals in 1995, but \nthe incidents were more violent. There was an 8 percent drop in the \nnumber of incidents, but a 10 percent increase in the number of \nassaults and rapes.\n  We need to realize that the name-calling, the graffiti, the \ndiscrimination, and the threats and violence are all signs of a \npervasive problem. The more informed we are about the scope and nature \nof our communities' problems with hate crimes, the better able we will \nbe to develop effective prevention and prosecution strategies, as well \nas support structures for victims of these crimes.\n  I am pleased to join with Senator Hatch today to express our \ngratitude to our colleagues, the Attorney General, law enforcement and \nadvocacy groups across the Nation who helped us to pass this important \nlegislation and urge our friends in the House to move quickly to pass \nthis as well.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the bill be \ndeemed read a third time and passed; that the motion to reconsider be \nlaid upon the table; and that any statements relating to the bill be \nplaced at the appropriate place in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The bill (S. 1624) was deemed read the third time and passed, as \nfollows:\n\n                                S. 1624\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nCommerce Committee be discharged from further consideration of H.R. \n1965 and that the Senate proceed to its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (H.R. 1965) to reauthorize the Coastal Zone \n     Management Act of 1972, and for other purposes.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the immediate \nconsideration of the bill?\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I support Senate passage of H.R. 1965, a \nbill to reauthorize the Coastal Zone Management Act [CZMA] through \nfiscal year 1999. H.R. 1965 is similar to section 205 of S. 1142, a \nbill that Senators Pressler, Hollings, Burns, Breaux, and I have \nsponsored to reauthorize the activities of the National Oceanic and \nAtmospheric Administration. Our bill has been reported by the Senate \nCommerce Committee, but has not yet been brought before the full \nSenate.\n  The CZMA was enacted in 1972 to, among other things, provide grants \nto States as an incentive to develop Federally approved coastal zone \nmanagement [CZM] plans. CZM plans are intended to help plan for \ndevelopment in, and protect, coastal areas. Twenty-four coastal States \nand five island territories now have Federally approved CZM plans. \nAlaska, which has over half the coastline of the United States, has had \na CZM plan in place since 1979. Of the seven eligible coastal States \nand territories that do not yet have approved CZM plans, five--Georgia, \nMinnesota, Ohio, Texas and Indiana--are in the process of developing \nplans.\n  In fiscal year 1995 and fiscal year 1996, the States and territories \nwith approved CZM plans received appropriations totalling $45.5 million \nand $46.2 million, respectively. H.R. 1965 authorizes appropriations \nthrough fiscal year 1999 with modest growth to these amounts, at \nroughly the same levels as S. 1142. The bill also reauthorizes grants \nfor States to develop CZM plans, increasing the amounts that may be \nreceived, but ending the development grants program after October 1, \n1999.\n  H.R. 1965 includes an amendment to prevent the Secretary of Commerce \nfrom delaying the issuance of permits. Section 307 of the CZMA requires \nfederal activities--including private activities that require a Federal \npermit, and federal assistance to State and local governments--to be \nconsistent with the State's CZM plan. Applicants for Federal permits--\nincluding permits to explore, develop or produce oil in areas leased \nunder the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act [OCSLA]--are required to \ncertify that the activity is consistent with the State's CZM plan \nbefore the Federal permit can be issued. States must concur with the \ncertification, but applicants may appeal the State's decision to the \nSecretary of Commerce. Section 8 of H.R. 1965 requires the Secretary to \npublish a notice when the record for any appeal has ended, and to make \na decision on the appeal within 90 days--with a possible extension of \n45 days. This would prevent the Secretary from simply refusing to make \na decision on an appeal.\n  H.R. 1965 does not reauthorize funds for the Secretary of Commerce \nand Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency to enforce the \nsection of law passed in 1990 to require States with CZM plans to \nprepare ``coastal nonpoint pollution control programs,'' and also does \nnot reauthorize grants to States to prepare those programs.\n  I encourage other Members of the Senate to support Senate passage of \nH.R. 1965.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I rise to voice my support for passage \nof H.R. 1965, a bill to reauthorize the Coastal Zone Management Act \n[CZMA] for the fiscal years 1997, 1998, 1999. This language is similar \nto language contained in S. 1142, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric \nAdministration authorization bill, which the Commerce Committee \nreported favorably late last session.\n  In 1969, the Commission on Marine Science, Engineering and \nResources--the--Stratton Commission--recom-mended that:\n\n       A Coastal Zone Management Act be enacted which will provide \n     policy objectives for the coastal zone and authorize federal \n     grants-in-aid to facilitate the establishment of State \n     Coastal Zone Authorities empowered to manage the coastal \n     waters and adjacent land.\n\n  In response to this recommendation, Congress in 1972 enacted coastal \nzone management legislation to balance coastal development and \npreservation needs. To encourage State participation, the CZMA \nestablished a voluntary, two-stage, State assistance program. The first \nstage involves the award of section 305 grants to coastal States for \ndevelopment of coastal management programs meeting certain Federal \nrequirements. State programs which were judged by the Secretary of \nCommerce to meet those requirements received Federal approval and \nbecame eligible for the second stage of grants. This second stage, \nunder section 306, provides ongoing assistance for States to implement \ntheir federally approved coastal programs. All grants require equal \nmatching funds from the State. Since passage of the CZMA, all 34 \neligible State and territories have participated in the program to some \ndegree. Of the original 34 participants, 29--24 States and five \nterritories--currently have programs which have achieved federally \napproved status. Only five States are not actively participating in the \nprogram: Georgia, Texas, Indiana, Minnesota, and Ohio. Considering the \n29 programs for which Federal approval has been attained, the national \nCZM network covers in excess of 93 percent of the Nation's marine and \nGreat Lakes coastline.\n  The nature and structure of CZM programs vary widely from State to \nState. This diversity was intended by Congress. Some States, like North \nCarolina, passed comprehensive legislation as a framework for coastal \nmanagement. Other States, like Oregon, used existing land use \nlegislation as the\n\n[[Page S5460]]\n\nfoundation for their federally approved programs. Finally, States like \nFlorida and Massachusetts networked existing, single-purpose laws into \na comprehensive umbrella for coastal management. The national program, \ntherefore, is founded in the authorities and powers of the coastal \nStates and local governments. Through the CZMA, these collective \nauthorities are orchestrated to serve the ``national interest in \neffective management, beneficial use, protection, and development of \nthe coastal zone.'' This 24-year program is a success story of how the \nlocal, State, and Federal Government can work together for the benefit \nof all who enjoy and rely on our coastal resources. H.R. 1965 is a \nsimple 3-year reauthorization of a program that works well.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the bill be \ndeemed read a third time and passed; that the motion to reconsider be \nlaid upon the table; and that any statements relating to the bill \nappear at the appropriate place in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The bill (H.R. 1965) was deemed read the third time and passed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/05/21/senate-section/article/S5459-1", "month": "05", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "21", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5460]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                MEASURE READ FOR THE FIRST TIME--S. 1788\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY.
