We hope we can get this \nbill finished by then, and we would not be back in session until \nTuesday morning beginning at 9:30. We may be asked to consider other \nlegislative items that are cleared for action. We are still looking for \nother appropriations conference reports that may be coming over, \nperhaps not today, but we have at least one more we think we may be \nable to take up early next week.

Under the previous order, the Senate will now \nresume consideration of H.R. 1350, which the clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (H.R. 1350) to amend the Merchant Marine Act, 1936, \n     to revitalize the United States flag merchant marine, and for \n     other purposes.\n\n  The Senate resumed consideration of the bill.\n\n       Pending:\n       Grassley amendment No. 5391, to provide for a uniform \n     system of incentive pay for certain hazardous duties \n     performed by merchant seamen.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 5391\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There will now be a period of 30 minutes of \ndebate, equally divided, on the motion to table the Grassley amendment \nNo. 5391.\n  Who seeks time?\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I yield myself 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, during wartime, in an area where there \nis military conflict between the United States and an opponent, there \nare legitimate war bonuses paid to people in the military for serving \nunder more severe conditions, and there are also war bonuses paid to \nour seafarers for serving under those same conditions. The only problem \nis that there is a great inequity between what the seafarers get as a \nbonus and what our regular military gets paid. The purpose of this \namendment is to make sure that those bonuses are the same.\n  So my amendment, which is about to be voted on at 10 o'clock, \nrepresents common sense. What people don't like about Washington is \nthey see their money being wasted because we don't\n\n[[Page S11062]]\n\nuse commonsense approaches to governing and spending the taxpayers' \nmoney--the same commonsense way that the average family and small \nbusiness has to use to live within their income and balance their \nbudgets.\n  Why should taxpayers be saddled with war bonuses for seafarers, which \nevidence shows can be 50 times as high as those war bonuses that we \ngive the men and women in the Reserve or the regular military? One \nPersian Gulf seafarer got a bonus of $15,700 for 2 months. The regular \nmilitary would get, during that same period of time, a 2-month war \nbonus of $300--$300 as compared to $15,700.\n  The argument was made last night that the taxpayers don't end up \npaying these war bonuses. Well, the taxpayers do end up paying. The \nargument was made last night that, well, our Treasury was reimbursed by \na lot of nations around the world for our efforts in Kuwait. That is \ntrue, we were. I was part of the effort to make that happen. But we \ndon't conduct war, or at least we should not be conducting war, to make \na profit.\n  At any time in the future when our military ends up paying these \nbonuses, the taxpayers are going to be paying them. But this is not \njust a taxpayer issue. This is an issue of equity between seafarers and \nour full-time military people.\n  My colleagues have received letters from a number of taxpayers and \npublic-interest organizations, representing hundreds of thousands of \nAmericans, who adamantly oppose this legislation that is before us. \nThree of them have expressed support for my amendments, for instance, \nCitizens Against Government Waste will key vote my amendment. The \nNational Taxpayers Union will weight it heavily in their annual voting \nanalysis. And Citizens for a Sound Economy strongly supports this \namendment as well.\n  Furthermore, this war bonus amendment is supported by a number of \nretired admirals--admirals, I might add, whose good names were lent to \nthe American Security Council letter in support of this bill, and who \nnow support my pro-taxpayer, pro-defense amendments.\n  Taxpayers do end up paying for seafarers' war bonuses. as well as the \nincredibly high salaries and benefits they receive year in and year \nout.\n\n  This is so because we in Congress have allowed an unaccountable \npayment system to the U.S.-flag carriers that allow them to pass on to \nUncle Sam virtually all of their costs plus a hefty profit for any \nbusiness they do for the Government.\n  Mr. President, collective bargaining is great when Congress allows us \nto have an open checking account to the United States Treasury to cover \nsalaries, benefits, and war bonuses.\n  This chart includes the salaries, benefits, and overtime of seafarers \nthat this bill will subsidize--$310,915 per month, and most of this \npaid for by taxpayers. Seafarers get these generous benefits from \ntaxpayers year in and year out, and then, if they do someday deliver \ngoods into a war zone, they can get a war bonus.\n  Take a look at this category called ``able-bodied seaman.'' His base \npay is $12,192 per month. His war bonus for a month could therefore, be \n$12,192 and he could get an extra $600 per day if his vessel is \nactually shot at.\n  My amendment was characterized last night, and I quote as \n``demeaning, unfair, and insulting to seafarers.'' There is no way that \nyou can see it that way. What this amendment tries to do is to seek \nfairness to our men and women in the regular military, but most \nimportantly accountability for the American taxpayer.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, the bill before us sets up a prospect of \nhaving the merchant marine available to the United States in the event \nof emergency on a daily charge basis. The taxpayers will not pay any \nmore regardless of the contract between the seafarers and their \nemployer, the operator of the vessel. This is a new approach.\n  The Senator from Iowa is mistaken. The funds that were paid for those \nships that were in the Persian Gulf were not taxpayer dollars. They \nwere dollars provided by our Persian Gulf allies. In any event, we are \ntrying to change that.\n  I say to my friend from Iowa that these people are not in the \nmilitary. They are civilians. They are not subject to the control of \nthe Federal Government. Their salaries are not in the control of the \nFederal Government. The Constitution prevents what the Senator from \nIowa wants to do, and that is for Congress to legislate an amendment to \na private contract between the seafarers and their employers.\n  I have to say that, if this is the Taxpayers Union provision, as the \nSenator from Iowa said, someone has misinformed that organization \nbecause this bill has nothing to do with payment to the people who man \nthese ships. That is between the employer and the employee. It is not a \nGovernment affair.\n  As I said last night, our alternative is to once again try to \ncontract with foreign ships to provide us vessels to carry our goods to \nsupply our men and women in the field in times of crisis. In the last \nPersian Gulf crisis we did that. We paid a minimum of 50 percent more \non the total contract--not just the seafarers' contract moneys for \nentering into a war zone but for the whole vessel. And some of them, \ndespite the fact that we paid them a 100-percent bonus, refused to \nenter the war zone.\n  This is a bill to give us the merchant marine we need in times of \nemergency, particularly in times of a war. These people are not in the \nmilitary. They are not subject to the draft. They are not required to \ngo in harm's way by any law that I know of, and there is no way to \nconscript them, which is what the amendment of the Senator from Iowa \nwill do. It literally conscripts them, and says, ``In the event of the \nwar, you are working for the Federal Government.''\n  I have never heard of such an approach. I want to say again that I \nmoved to table the amendment last night because it really does nothing \nto help this bill. It is an attempt to drag a red herring across the \nSenate floor and tell us that somehow or other the taxpayers will be \nforced to pay for these people extraordinary rates if they are called \nupon to provide service during times of war, that under the bill we \nhave to pay whatever their contract provides that their employer is \ngoing to pay them. The Secretary of Defense sets the rate for the cost \nof those vessels--fully crewed--under this bill; what is paid to the \nseafarer is between the employer and the employee. It is none of the \nFederal Government's business.\n\n  Does the Senator wish time?\n  Mr. INOUYE. Yes.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I yield such time as the Senator from Hawaii wants.\n  Mr. INOUYE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Hawaii.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, let the record indicate that we began this \ndebate on this amendment last evening. So what I say may be a bit \nrepetitive but I believe it must be repeated.\n  In World War II, 700 merchant marine ships were sunk, and most of \nthem are now resting, hopefully peacefully, at the bottom of either the \nAtlantic Ocean or the Pacific Ocean.\n  When these ships went under nearly 6,000 men, civilians who were \ncarrying military cargo, went down with the ships. The casualties that \nexceeded 6,000 in World War II was second only to that experienced by \nthe U.S. Marine Corps.\n  There is a difference. This amendment would suggest that merchant \nmariners should receive the same combat pay as our GI's suggesting that \nmerchant mariners are overpaid for standing in harm's way.\n  Mr. President, as some of my colleagues are aware, I had the great \nhonor of serving my country in uniform. And for serving in harm's way I \nreceived combat pay, which was a token amount. I believe at that time \nit was $10 a month. But we were not in the service for pay purposes. \nHowever, at the end of the war because of my injuries I receive a \nlifetime pension; a very generous one. I have a lifetime privilege of \nhospitalization and medical care. And that privilege also extends to my \ndependent, my wife. I received education under the GI bill of rights. \nAnd, as a result, I received my law degree and my baccalaureate. I can, \nif I wish to, purchase goods at the PX, or at the commissary. There are \nmany privileges. For example, when I die the Government will pay for my \ncoffin, and will pay for my headstone.\n\n[[Page S11063]]\n\n On the other hand, for the man who serves in the merchant marine, if \nhe should be wounded in action he will not receive a lifetime pension, \nnor will his wife receive hospitalization for the rest of her life. He \nwill not get a tombstone; a headstone. He will not receive the benefits \nof the GI bill of rights.\n  We are not talking about apples and apples, Mr. President. We cannot \ncompare the merchant marine and a man on a naval vessel.\n  I can understand why the merchant marine decided after World War II \nthat something had to be done to bring about equity. In World War II, \nnone of the benefits were available. Now, this small amount, $12,000 a \nmonth, for standing in harm's way and risking death is not much. As my \ncolleague from Alaska pointed out, we were not providing that war \nbonus. It was by the coalition forces.\n  Whatever it is, this amendment is demeaning to the merchant \nmariners--to suggest that merchant marine seamen are mercenaries. They \nare not mercenaries. In Desert Storm, many of the countries that were \nasked to deliver goods to our fighting forces refused to enter the \nPersian Gulf. Sixteen ships refused to go into the Persian Gulf. On the \nother hand, our American seamen, all of them, without hesitation, went \ninto the most dangerous of waters. Yes, it is insulting to suggest that \nthey are mercenaries. They are not. They are good, patriotic, \ndependable Americans.\n  Mr. President, I will support the motion to table this amendment.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I have 8 minutes--7 minutes remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has approximately 6 minutes \nremaining.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I yield myself such time as I consume.\n  I rise to respond to what the Senator from Alaska said, where he is \nright and where he is wrong. He is right that we are paying in \ncorporate welfare $2.1 million per ship to have these ships available, \nand the responsibility to the companies to provide shipping to meet \ntheir contracts, to meet our national defense needs.\n  That is under section 652. But when those ships are called up to \ndeliver materiel to the war zone, then you move to page 19, and this is \nwhere the Senator from Alaska is wrong. It says:\n\n       Compensation. In general, the Secretary of Transportation \n     shall provide in each Emergency Preparedness Agreement fair \n     and reasonable compensation for all commercial transportation \n     resources provided pursuant to this section.\n\n  That is above that $2.1 million. So we are going to pay more if these \nships are used. Then it goes on to specific requirements.\n\n       Compensation under this section shall not be less than the \n     contractor's commercial market charges for like \n     transportation resources; shall include all the contractor's \n     costs associated with provision and use of the contractor's \n     commercial resources to meet emergency requirements; in the \n     case of a charter of an entire vessel; shall be in addition \n     to and shall not in any way reflect amounts payable under \n     section 652.\n\n  So where the Senator from Alaska is wrong is that there are charges \nabove and beyond the $2.1 million when our ships are called to be used.\n  Let me repeat what my amendment deals with--fair and reasonable \ncosts. More importantly, ``all the contractor's costs associated with \nprovision'' obviously includes the war bonuses, and these \nextraordinarily high war bonuses were $15,700 for one seaman in the \nPersian Gulf war compared to $300 for the regular military.\n  Now, let us suppose the Senator from Alaska were right about those 47 \nships, that this corporate welfare is going to subsidize these \ncompanies that are making extreme amounts of profits. Then we have all \nthe other vessels that the Department of Defense can call on and will \ncall on to meet our national security needs, and this bill does not \napply to those. In those instances, obviously this bill does not apply, \nbut they will get war bonuses. Moreover, there is no place in this bill \nthat says war bonuses are not going to be paid to the employees on \nthose 47 ships. So my amendment goes to the heart of this issue, to \nestablish equity between our regular military people and our seafarers.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who seeks time?\n  Mr. STEVENS addressed the Chair,\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. STEVENS. The answer is simple, in my opinion. What we have is a \nsituation where today the only thing we have available to us in the \nevent of war or emergency is to contract once again with foreign \nshipping. We did that in the Persian Gulf war. As I said, we paid 50 \npercent to 100 percent more on the total charter price.\n  This bill is an attempt to change that concept and make available to \nus the U.S.-flag ships already crewed, ready to serve, and ready to go \nin harm's way because of their contractual commitments. We had foreign \nships that would not enter the war zone. We had foreign crews that \ndeserted their ships as they were going into the Persian Gulf.\n  We need a program to give us the capacity to continue to serve our \nfighting men and women when they are abroad. The impact of this bill is \nto provide a system to in effect have a standby charter. It is very \nsimilar to the reserve fleet we have for the airlines. The civil air \nreserve program provides us the aircraft. And just as in this case \nthose people who fly civilian planes into harm's way get war bonuses, \nthey get special bonuses, because, as the Senator from Hawaii points \nout, they have no rights to any of the benefits that are available to \nthose people who serve in the military should they be harmed when they \nare in harm's way.\n\n  What we are doing here now would authorize $100 million annually for \nsustainment sealift. That is $250 million less than the funded levels \nbefore and $150 million less than it is today --$250 million less than \nit was during the Persian Gulf period, $150 million less than the \nexisting program today.\n  The Senator's amendment is an attempt to destroy a program that is \ndesigned to save $150 million from the program as it stands today.\n  Now, we are going to pay these companies to reserve these vessels for \nour use in the event of war. The contracts that the Senator has \nmentioned are subject to approval by the Secretary of Defense. The \npayments that would be made will be made on an equitable basis, and \nthey will be subject to annual review by the Appropriations Committee \nwhich I hope to chair.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I would seek knowledge about how much time is remaining \non each side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Frahm). The Senator from Iowa has 1 \nminute 45 seconds, the Senator from Hawaii has 49 seconds.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I will use the remainder of my time right now and leave \nthe last word to the opponents of the amendment.\n  First of all, I think everybody heard my response to the original \nstatement of the Senator from Alaska in opposition to my amendment. I \ncame back and said that the bill provides for compensation, return of \nthe cost, plus profit, under what we are told is a fair and reasonable \nrate. It covers all costs, and so that includes war bonuses.\n  He went on in his last remarks to speak about how great the bill is. \nSo I think the absence of comment on my rebuttal speaks for itself; my \npoint is that under this bill these war bonuses are 50 times as high as \nthe men in the regular military get. Maybe the issue here is that we \nare not paying enough to regular Navy and Army, Air Force, and Marine \npersonnel who are in harm's way on the battlefield and we ought to be \npaying them more than what we are, so that they are not getting 50 \ntimes less than what the seafarers are getting. But, at least we should \nnot have this extraordinary difference between the two.\n\n  So, consequently, in my closing seconds I remind people the \nconservative fiscal group Citizens Against Government Waste, the \nNational Taxpayers Union, and the Citizens for a Sound Economy feel \nthat this amendment is a justified amendment to bring commonsense \nbudgeting, expenditure of money, commonsense use of the taxpayers' \nmoney to public policy on maritime issues.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Madam President, we only use these vessels for the time \nthey are actually in the war zone under this contract. As the Senator \nfrom Hawaii\n\n[[Page S11064]]\n\nsays, we pay people by the day rather than by the lifetime. I agree \nwith the Senator from Iowa, we ought to compensate our people in the \nmilitary who go in harm's way more than we do, but we set up a very \ncomplex system here to take care of the people who are actually harmed \nin the military. We set up a different system for people who enter \nharm's way for a very short period of time and we have no further \nresponsibility to them for any injuries they might sustain, as far as \nthat is concerned.\n  All of the costs of this bill are subject to rejection by the \nSecretary of Defense at the time the ships will be called up. He could \ndecline to use these ships and once again go back to trying to use \nforeign ships if they were available to us at a reasonable cost. There \nare no foreign ships available to us anywhere near the cost of this \nbill.\n  So I have moved to table this. I hope Senators will not be misled by \nthis concept that, somehow or another, conservatives oppose this bill. \nThis is a very fair bill to us and to the people who might be put in \nharm's way in order to serve the defense of our country.\n  I move to table, Madam President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the motion to \ntable amendment No. 5391, offered by the Senator from Iowa, Senator \nGrassley. The yeas and nays have been ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. NICKLES.

Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Madam President, I rise as a proud cosponsor of the \nMaritime Security Act. I urge my colleagues to give their support to \nthis important bill.\n  This bill is critical for America's future. This bill is about our \nnational security. A strong, vibrant merchant marine is absolutely \ncritical to our national defense and our economic security. We need to \nask ourselves one simple question, do we want to have a American \nshipping industry in the 21st century? The answer is an unequivocal \nyes.\n  Time and time again, we have seen the critical role our merchant \nmarine has played. In World War II, it was our merchant marine--our \n``heroes in dungarees'' who braved Nazi U-boats in the Atlantic and \nJapanese submarines in the Pacific in order to save Western \ncivilization at a cost of over 6,000 merchant mariners who lost their \nlife. The casualty rate for merchant mariners in World War II was \nsecond only to the Marine Corps.\n  In Korea, and Vietnam, our merchant marine kept the supply lines open \nfor our fighting forces and never let them down. In Desert Storm, \nalmost 80 percent of the cargo was transported on American ships with \nAmerican crews. Our merchant marine became the ``steel bridge'' to our \nmen and women in Saudi Arabia. General Schwarzkopf talked about how \nimportant the merchant marine was in sustaining our troops with needed \nsupplies. And had we gone into an escalated ground war our merchant \nmarine would have been even more important.\n  In Bosnia, United States mariners were used to activate the Ready \nReserve ships to aid peacekeeping efforts. Mr. President, history has \ntaught us one thing, we cannot rely on foreign countries with foreign \ncrews to transport our military cargo in time of war. This is why the \nDefense Department strongly supports this bill.\n  But this legislation is more than keeping merchant marine viable in \ntimes of crisis it is about keeping our shipyards open, and ensuring \nthat there will always be American ships moving American cargo across \nour oceans.\n  We cannot allow America's economy to be held hostage to the whims of \nforeign shipping companies or in some cases, foreign governments. In \naddition, our merchant marine fleet must compete with ships that fly \n``flags of convenience.'' Two-thirds of all merchant ships fly under \nflags of convenience.\n  Without the Maritime Security Program, American ships will be unable \nto compete against foreign ships that are heavily subsidized or state-\nowned. In addition, ``flag of convenience'' ships do not have to comply \nwith American environmental or safety standards giving foreign ships \nanother advantage.\n  Our merchant marine provides good jobs at good wages and we have a \nresponsibility to keep the American flag flying over the oceans of the \nworld. That's why we need the Maritime Security Act--to give our \nmerchant marine a fighting chance in today's shipping climate.\n  Finally, Madam President, this bill makes sense for the American \ntaxpayer. Compared to the present maritime program, the Maritime \nSecurity Act will cut costs by more than 50 percent. If this bill is \nnot adopted, taxpayers could pay even more if the Defense Department \nwas forced to build its own military sealift fleet.\n  Madam President, when the world makes a 911 call to America, we must \nbe ready. We must have a merchant marine ready to defend our national \nsecurity and our economic security. I urge my colleagues to give their \nstrong support to this legislation.\n  Mr. STEVENS. It is my understanding the distinguished Senator from \nIllinois would like to have time to make a statement. I ask unanimous \nconsent the Senator have 5 minutes as in morning business while we try \nto work out this agreement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. I thank the Senator from Alaska.\n  \n                            ____________________\n  \n  \n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/20/senate-section/article/S11061-6", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "20", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11065-S11067]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n[[Page S11065]]\n\n\n\n                   AFFORDABILITY OF HIGHER EDUCATION\n\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. Madam President, yesterday some of my colleagues \nwere debating the issue of student loans and performance of this \nCongress with regard to education. No issue is more central to our \nNation's future and the 21st century than the availability and the \naccessibility of quality public education from kindergarten through \ncollege. The accessibility of higher education is threatened, Madam \nPresident, by the exploding cost of higher education, documented in a \nreport released yesterday by the General Accounting Office.\n  The General Accounting Office, having studied the cost of tuition in \n4-year public institutions of higher learning nationwide, documented \nthat tuition has increased some 234 percent over the last 15 years. As \na percentage of median household income, tuition has nearly doubled \nover the same period. In 14 States today, college tuition is more than \n10 percent of median household income. In 30 States, it is more than 8 \npercent of household income. In all but one State, tuition as a \npercentage of household income is more than it was 15 years ago.\n  What this means is that access to higher education is getting more \nand more out of reach for working and middle-class Americans. What this \nmeans is that our country is suffering a kind of brain drain, driven by \nthe escalating costs of higher education.\n  Madam President, that is exactly the wrong direction. By the year \n2000, the Department of Labor estimates that more than half of all new \njobs will require an education beyond high school. The cost of college \nhas a direct impact on access to college. The more tuition goes up, the \nmore students will be priced out of their opportunity for the American \ndream. Our country as a whole will suffer the loss of talent and of \ntraining. We cannot as a Nation prepare for the 21st century by making \nit more difficult now for our children to access higher education.\n  In the global economy, America must carve out the upper niche. We \ncannot and should not expect our workers to compete with 50-cents-a-day \nThird World labor. Our strength in the information-intensive 21st \ncentury will continue to be our people. Education is the key to that \nstrength. Our community, our country as a whole, will benefit from a \nwell-educated work force.\n  A quality public education has always given poor and middle-class \nAmericans economic opportunities. The link between educational \nattainment and earnings is unquestionable. The average earnings of the \nmost educated Americans is, today, 600 percent greater than that of the \nleast educated Americans. As we move nearer to the 21st century and \ninto an information-driven economy, the gap between high school and \ncollege graduates will grow. A college graduate in 1980 earned 43 \npercent more per hour than a high school graduate. By 1994, that had \nincreased to 73 percent. When we reduce access to higher education, we \nreduce access to the American dream and we create strains on our \ncommunity and on our social compact from which we may have a very \ndifficult time recovering, even into the next generation.\n  Madam President, we must improve the quality and the accessibility of \neducation so that no American child gets a high school diploma without \nbeing able to read, subtract, add, or use a computer, and so that all \nAmericans may have access to higher education, not just the wealthy \nelite. The rungs on the ladder of opportunity in America are crafted in \nthe classroom. We cannot let higher education become so expensive that \nonly a fraction of our society can afford it.\n  Unfortunately, the GAO has documented that is exactly the direction \nin which we are now heading. For a typical family with more than one \nchild in school, in the States at the bottom of the affordability \nscale--and there is an affordability scale included in the report--the \ncost of college can easily consume 30 percent to 40 percent of that \nfamily's annual income. For families with several children who attend \ncollege, tuition can become the most significant expenditure and \nfinancial burden of a lifetime.\n\n  The 234-percent increase in tuition over the last 15 years compares, \nMadam President, to an 82-percent increase in median household income \nand a 74-percent increase in the Consumer Price Index. What that means \nis the cost of tuition is rising far in excess of the rises in the \ncosts of other indicia of our economic well-being in this country.\n  Madam President, I know for a fact that I would not be able to be in \nthe U.S. Senate today were it not for quality public education and the \naccessibility and the affordability of higher education. The Chicago \npublic schools gave me a solid foundation, and I was then able to \nattend the University of Illinois and later the University of Chicago, \nin spite of the fact that my parents were working-class people. One can \nonly imagine, Madam President, how many Carol Moseley-Brauns, or the \nequivalent, of this generation did not have that opportunity. The \nexploding cost of college is closing the door of opportunity for them. \nI believe that our generation has an absolute duty to keep that door \nopen and to preserve the American dream for the 21st century and for \nour children and for our community as a whole.\n  Finally, Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in \nthe Record the GAO report so that Senators and private citizens who are \ninterested in reading the report itself and exploring the methodology \nused by the General Accounting Office may do so.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n         General Accounting Office, Health, Education and Human \n           Services Division,\n                               Washington, DC, September 19, 1996.\n     Hon. Carol Moseley-Braun,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Moseley-Braun: In August 1996, we reported \n     that there is widespread concern about the increase in \n     college tuition levels and that average tuition levels vary \n     widely among the states.\\1\\ In our earlier report, we showed \n     that tuition were rising faster than college expenditures and \n     that state funding and grant aid were not keeping pace with \n     these costs.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n     \\1\\ Higher Education: Tuition Increasing Faster Than \n     Household Income and Public Colleges' Costs (GAO/HEHS-96-154, \n     Aug. 15, 1996).\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n       Based on our report, you requested information on (1) the \n     states' public 4-year colleges' and universities' average \n     tuition as a percentage for median household income and (2) \n     comparative increases in tuition at these schools from school \n     year 1980-81 through 1995-95, with increases in other \n     selected consumer prices and median household income during \n     the same period.\n       To determine schools' average tuition as a percentage of \n     median household income, we divided the average annual \n     tuition for in-state undergraduate students of 4-year public \n     colleges and universities for school year 1995-96 in each \n     state by the state's median household income for calendar \n     year 1994, the latest year for which such data were \n     available. For our comparison of tuition price increase with \n     changes in selected consumer prices and median household \n     income, we used the consumer price index (CPI) and other \n     information from the 1995 Statistical Abstract of the United \n     States.\n       We conducted our review in August and September 1996 in \n     accordance with generally accepted government auditing \n     standards.\n     Results in brief\n       On a nationwide basis, our analysis shows that the average \n     tuition (including related fees) for in-state undergraduate \n     students of 4-year public colleges and universities for \n     academic year 1995-96 was about 8.9 percent of median \n     household income; however, there is a significant difference \n     among the states. On one end of the spectrum, Hawaii's \n     average tuition for the 1995-96 school year was less than 4 \n     percent of median household income. In contrast, Vermont's \n     average tuition for 4-year public colleges and universities \n     was over 15 percent of median household income. In general we \n     found that state differences are more closely associated with \n     tuition prices than with income levels. That is, states in \n     which the average tuition was a low percentage of median \n     household income tended to be ones with low tuitions but not \n     high incomes.\n       From school year 1980-81 through 1994-95, tuition charges \n     at 4-year public colleges and universities for in-state \n     undergraduate students increased nationally by 234 percent. \n     In contrast, other consumer prices and household incomes \n     increased at a much slower pace. Medical costs, for example, \n     increased 182 percent, and consumer expenditures for new cars \n     increased 160 percent. Household incomes rose 82 percent \n     during the same period.\n     College tuition as a percentage of income varies widely among \n         States\n       Our analysis showed that schools' average tuition as a \n     percentage of median household income at 4-year public \n     colleges and universities varies widely among the states. \n     Schools in Hawaii, for example, were found to have tuition \n     taking 3.61 percent of median\n\n[[Page S11066]]\n\n     household income.\\2\\ In contrast, 4-year public colleges and \n     universities in Vermont had a higher ratio--tuition was 15.42 \n     percent of income. The national average was 8.88 percent. \n     Enclosure 1 shows the average tuition as a percentage of \n     median household income for 4-year public colleges and \n     universities in each state. This percentage tends to be \n     higher in the Northeastern states.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n     \\2\\ As we pointed out in our August report, however, Hawaii's \n     schools may not have the lowest tuition level in school year \n     1996-97. The state approved an 84.6-percent increase for in-\n     state undergraduate tuition at the University of Hawaii's \n     Manoa campus.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n       In general, state differences in this percentage are more \n     closely associated with tuition prices than with income \n     levels. That is, states in which the average tuition was a \n     low percentage of median household income tendered to be ones \n     with low tuitions but not high incomes. For example, of the \n     15 states with the lowest percentages, 13 were among the \n     states with the lowest tuitions while only 5 of them were \n     among the states with the highest incomes. At the other end \n     of the spectrum, of the 15 states with the highest \n     percentages, 11 were among the states with the highest \n     tuitions but only 1 of them was among the states with the \n     lowest incomes.\n     College tuition compared to selected consumer prices and \n         household incomes\n       From school year 1980-81 through school year 1994-95, the \n     average annual tuition at 4-year public colleges and \n     universities for in-state undergraduate students increased \n     from $804 per year to 42,689, or 234 percent. Over \n     approximately the same period, median household income \n     increased by 82 percent, from $17,710 in 1980 to $32,264 in \n     1994. During this 15-year period, the prices and costs of \n     other consumer goods also increased, but not as fast as the \n     increases in tuition. For example, the average consumer \n     expenditure for a new car went from $7,754 in 1980 to $19,676 \n     in 1994, an increase of 160 percent.\n     Agency comments\n       Information contained in this correspondence is consistent \n     with that in our August 1996 report in which the Department \n     was given an opportunity to provide comments.\n       We are sending copies of this letter to the Secretary of \n     Education, appropriate congressional committees and Members, \n     and other interested parties.\n       Please call me at (202) 512-7014 if you our your staff have \n     any questions regarding this correspondence.

It is a very important study. It suggests that we \nneed to begin to take up this issue and examine the cause of the \nexploding cost of college tuition so we can make cogent policy in this \narea. I feel confident that we have the ability, and certainly we have \nthe will, to begin to address this question so that college is as \naccessible for this generation of Americans as it was for every Member \nof this body. I encourage my colleagues to examine the work done by the \nGeneral Accounting Office. I thank the General Accounting Office for \nits investigation in this area and for its work in this area. I believe \nthat it will provide the foundation for a very important debate in our \ncountry.\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. Yes.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I commend the Senator from Illinois for her excellent \nstatement. I think all of us understand that she has been a leader here \nin the Senate in pointing out not only the issues of quality that are \nso important in schools, but also the issue of physical facilities. She \nunderstands that if you have a dilapidated building with poor support \nfacilities inside the building, it creates a climate that makes it much \nmore difficult for children to learn.\n  In my own State of Massachusetts, this is the case. We are one of the \noldest States, and many of our schools are also quite old. Too often, \nour schools, both in the inner cities and in other areas, have \ndeteriorated over the years. She has been a strong leader in \nchallenging the Senate to make progress in this area and has challenged \nthe President to take the initiative in this area. This is going to \nmake a great deal of difference for students.\n  And now, this report on rising costs of higher education is an \nimportant contribution. Like the Senator from Illinois, I am strongly \ncommitted to creating a package for young people of talent and ability, \nso that they have access to whatever they need--schools, 4-year \ncolleges, community colleges, State colleges, or whatever it might be. \nThey must be able to patch together different kinds of programs so they \ncan go on to college.\n  Tuition costs are a problem not just in private colleges and \nuniversities, but at public colleges as well. In my own State of \nMassachusetts this is certainly the case. In tuition as a percentage of \nfamily income, Massachusetts ranks 38th in the Nation, making it one of \nthe more expensive States for families who want to help their children \nobtain a quality college education.\n  So the cost of higher education is a key issue. As the Senator \nunderstands very well, today those decisions are often made based on \nthe size of the pocketbook or wallet rather than the young person's \nabilities. It is important for us to ensure student access to higher \neducation, and to look at the core reasons why these costs have gone up \nso much. Too often in the past, we have not watched that as closely as \nwe should have.\n  I think the Senator strengthens all of us who believe that education \nshould be a major priority for this Nation. It leads to good \nemployment, it is essential in training our doctors, scientists, and \nengineers, and it is key in so many areas of public policy. She \nreminded us of this by requesting this GAO study about the costs of \nhigher education. It is helpful to all of us, not only in the Congress, \nbut also in States and local communities, to understand this issue. I \nthink it is a very important study, and we should build on it in the \nnext Congress. It is timely and I think it can have an important impact \nas we begin to address needs in higher education.\n  I commend the Senator for her continued interest in education. As \nsomeone who serves on the Education Committee, I have observed \nfirsthand her very strong commitment in elementary, secondary, and \nhigher education. I commend her for her initiatives and for her \nexcellent statement.\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. Thank you. Madam President, I thank the Senator \nfrom Massachusetts. The Senator from Massachusetts is being modest. He \nnot\n\n[[Page S11067]]\n\nonly serves on the Education Committee, but is the leader on that \ncommittee on the issues pertaining to educational opportunity for our \nyoung people. I thank him for his kind, complimentary remarks.\n  I also thank him for pointing out how these issues link together. We \njust finished doing a television program about rebuilding our Nation's \ncrumbling schools. The Senator is right. Fully a third of the schools \nacross this country are in dilapidated condition and need extensive \nrepair or replacement. The previous GAO study found this was a \ncondition that expresses itself in all regions of the country and in \nall communities. In inner-city communities, 38 percent of the schools \nare crumbling; in suburban communities, 29 percent are crumbling; in \nrural communities, it is 30 percent. This is something that happens in \ncities, suburbs, and rural communities. That is a real challenge for \nus, because our children cannot learn if their schools are falling \ndown. The report makes it clear that we are failing to live up to our \nresponsibility as a generation to provide the generation of Americans \ncoming into the school systems now with an environment in which \nlearning can take place, and with the support that they will need to be \ncompetitive in the global economy.\n\n  So looking at these issues, the General Accounting Office has been \njust wonderfully helpful because their studies give us the kind of \nintellectual and demographic base, if you will, because they have gone \nand actually counted and done the research and the surveys to find out \nwhat the true facts are in this area. So it is not just a matter of \nlooking at what do we see when we drive past a school, but rather \nhaving actual documentation of what is going on with regard to \ncrumbling schools all over the Nation.\n  This last report on college tuition is really fascinating. I, again, \nencourage my colleagues to look at it, or anyone else who would like \nto. It is available from the General Accounting Office. A 234-percent \nincrease in college tuition is stunning. Even medical care costs, which \nwe have been talking about, rose about 182 percent. So this is \noutpacing even the increase in medical care costs. So it is very clear \nthat families are having a difficult time coping with this. State \nsupport for higher education is declining at the same time costs to \ncolleges are going up. The result is that young people are having a \nharder and harder time accessing higher educational opportunities.\n  We have asked the Department of Education, as of yesterday, to make \navailable information on scholarships and information on tuition on the \nWorld Wide Web, so that people can access that information through the \nInternet. It can be more accessible, and they can do the kind of \nshopping that may be particularly necessary given the escalating cost \nof higher education. Certainly, we have to get to the bottom of this \nand to the heart of this problem to find out what the reasons are. Why \nis the tuition going up so high and so quickly? What can we do to \nameliorate the impact on working and middle-class families?\n  I commend all of my colleagues who share a concern for education and \nthese issues. I think nothing short of our Nation's national defense is \nat stake here. We will not be able to be competitive in this 21st \ncentury global economy, in an information age, unless we provide our \nyoung people with an opportunity to have the highest level of skills in \nthe world. It is that challenge that compels us today.\n  Again, I thank my colleague.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. If the Senator will yield for one other point. Would she \nnot agree that unless we are able to get a handle on escalating \neducation costs, it is going to be very difficult to convince taxpayers \nto provide more support for education, if providing more will not lead \nto greater opportunity for the young people? For those of us that are \nstrongly committed to expanding opportunities, if we see that what we \ndo here does not work, it makes the task much harder.\n  There are those who might say, ``If we provide more resources, they \nwill just get swallowed up in tuition increases.'' That charge must be \nanswered, and answered effectively. I think the work done on this \ncommittee and the report by the GAO should be helpful.\n  Finally, I think the report that the Senator commissioned on the \ndilapidation of elementary and secondary schools creatively points out \nways of obtaining scarce resources at the State and local level.\n  Rehabilitating schools is a complex and difficult challenge. We at \nthe Federal level are not going to be able to resolve all of these \nproblems, but commitment at all levels is required, and I hope we will \nbe able to deal with these issues in much greater detail in the next \nCongress.\n  As I say, I am grateful to the Senator for her continued interest and \nvery constructive work in this area.\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. Madam President, I thank the Senator, my friend \nand colleague, from Massachusetts.\n  Again, the first report, ``Profiles of School Condition by State'' is \navailable. Similarly, the new one on college affordability ``Tuition \nIncreasing Faster Than Household Income and Public Colleges' Costs'' is \navailable.\n  Again, I couldn't agree more with my colleague when he talks about \nthe qualities because certainly it is going to require the cooperation \nof educators, of parents, of the kids themselves, and all of us in the \nNational Government--and State and local governments--all are going to \nhave to cooperate and carve out our respective responsibilities, our \nrespective niche, if you will, in addressing these issues. The \neducators are going to have to address the equality issues and whether \nor not youngsters are getting the kind of quality education and skills \nthey will need for this 21st century.\n  We at the national level have to address the Federal support for \neducation all the way through. The State and local governments may want \nto take a look at better ways to fund our schools so that they are not \nscaling down so that the opportunity is available.\n  I look very much forward to working with my colleague from \nMassachusetts and the committee with as much compassion as it takes. \nHopefully we can come up with, again, some cogent policy responses \nguided by the facts as produced by the General Accounting Office.\n  I thank the Chair. I thank the Senator from Alaska.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DOMENICI addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI.

Madam President, I rise today to congratulate a woman \nfrom my home State of New Mexico who will be honored on November 1, \n1996, by being inducted into the National Cowgirl Hall of Fame.\n  Harriet Frances Lee, better known as Bita, hails from the small town \nof San Mateo, NM. Raised on a sheep and cattle ranch, Bita embodied the \nspirit of the West. Sheep, cattle, and hard work were all a part of \nBita's daily life. She, her twin brother Harry, and her mother and \nfather, Floyd and Frances, all worked side-by-side creating and \nmaintaining the American dream.\n  Most people only know the old West through Hollywood movies, Louis \nL'Amour books, and history lessons. Many times, however, Hollywood, \nbooks, and history lessons forget to mention the cowgirls. Women like \nBita have always been a part of the rich fabric of my State and other \nStates in the West. The National Cowgirl Hall of Fame and Western \nHeritage Center's mission is to ensure that the West, its women, and \ntheir heritage are remembered.\n  The women of the West did not just take care of home and hearth. \nThese women rode horses, sheared sheep, roped steers, managed books, \nand worked day-to-day with the earth. The National Cowgirl Hall of Fame \nand Heritage Center holds the memories of\n\n[[Page S11068]]\n\nthese women, and honors those who don't live in the past but remain a \npart of our living heritage.\n  Bita died in early 1991, but her legacy lives on. Although her life \nhas ended, Bita left behind her two nephews, Floyd and Harry, and \nsister-in-law Iona, to run the ranch she loved. She was the last of the \nLees that ran the ranch during the Depression and the drastic fall of \nsheep prices, and kept the ranch operating in the days before paved \nroads, cellular phones, and four-wheel drives.\n  Bita was an avid horse woman; she could ride the most surly of beasts \nand rope the most wily of steers. Often known for her breed of \nPalominos and her ability to rope, Bita was an avid worker with the 4-H \nof New Mexico and the New Mexico State Fair. She maintained a love for \nagriculture by living it and passing it on to others.\n  Although Bita was not world-famous like some of her counterparts in \nthe National Cowgirl Hall of Fame, she was famous in her corner of the \nworld. Her neighbors knew her well and delighted in her wood-working \nability, her keen and subtle sense of humor, and her composure. She was \na tiny woman in stature, but she earned the respect of all her ranch \nemployees, whom she managed with a firm hand and kind heart.\n  Last year, my colleague Joe Skeen and I each sent letters of support \nto the Cowgirl Hall of Fame regarding Bita's nomination. Over 600 women \nare nominated each year to fill four open spots. I am pleased that the \nNational Cowgirl Hall of Fame has recognized Bita's significant \ncontribution to the heritage of the West by accepting her nomination. \nMy sincere congratulations and best wishes to Bita's family and many \nfriends.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum, Madam President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Coverdell). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business.\n  Mr. STEVENS. For how long?\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. For 11 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Chair recognizes the Senator from Iowa.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/20/senate-section/article/S11067-1", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "20", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11068-S11069]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n      MILITARY HISTORY AT THE NATIONAL MUSEUM OF AMERICAN HISTORY\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, particularly since there are on the \nfloor people who are very interested in the military of the United \nStates, I want to speak to an issue that should have been discussed 2 \ndays ago during the Interior Department appropriations bill. But the \nInterior Department will still be up next week when it is put back up \non the calendar, or in parts of the continuing resolution, and so I \nalert my friends to a trend in military history that is very disturbing \nto me as it relates to the Smithsonian Institution.\n  Upon debating the Interior Department's funding, this is as good time \nas any to voice concern over the interpretations of American history at \nthe Smithsonian Institution's National Museum of American History. \nApparently, military history has assumed a minor role in the museum's \ndepiction of this Nation's history. The exhibit space allocated to the \ndisplay of military items has slowly decreased. A large percentage of \nthat which is currently on display remains in the cases in which they \nwere installed for the opening of the museum over 30 years ago. Further \ninquiry has led me to believe that what remains of the Armed Forces' \nhistory hall is in jeopardy.\n  The administrators of this museum appear to be swayed by the ideology \nof revisionist/liberal historians. They desire to decrease even further \nthe exhibit space devoted to U.S. military history. This is reflective \nof their adherence to the concept of new history as opposed to the \ntraditional approach, which emphasizes important people, events, and \nmovements.\n  History has typically been organized into areas of concentration, \nsuch as military, diplomatic, political, and economic history. But a \nmuseum devoted to a new history would, instead, reflect cultural, \nsocial, gender, ethnic, and community concentrations. Obviously, a \nconventional exhibit depicting our Nation's military history would not \nfit into this theme. This approach, in itself, is not inherently bad. \nBut dominance of this new history to the detriment of a conventional \nrepresentative display of military history is disturbing.\n  This overemphasis on common people and the infrastructure of their \ncommunity tends to then decrease the importance of meaningful events \nand significant people, which have played pivotal roles throughout the \nhistory of our Nation.\n  Military history is, therefore, overlooked because it is a \nconglomeration of momentous events and distinguished soldiers. What is \nneglected by these historians is the detail that, throughout the \nhistory of the Armed Forces, we witnessed common people leaving the \nsecurity of their communities and performing extraordinary, \nconsequential feats in the scheme of military affairs.\n  This ideology is reflective of that which is popular in many liberal \nand academic circles. Military history is deemed evil in that it \ninvolves death and weaponry. As a result, the great impact the military \nhas had on every American is disregarded.\n  Since the habitation of this country by Europeans in the 16th \ncentury, the militia and its leaders have played a prominent role. This \nis true not only in the defense of their people but in society as well. \nWeapons were an important tool of the early settlers in the defending \nof their families from hostile native Americans. They were important \nalso in the task of putting food on the table. Not only has the \nmilitary continually defended the Nation, but it has assisted in the \nexploration and opening of the frontiers to settlers.\n\n  Military contractors and arsenals played an important role in \ndeveloping interchangeable parts, standardization, and mass production. \nIn more recent years, it has played important roles in developing new \ntechnologies that we use every day, such as computers, new \ncommunication techniques, et cetera. The military has touched many \nfacets of our lives, and this history is not exhibited in any museum.\n  There are various Naval, Army, Marine Corps and Air Force museums \nscattered across the country. But they only concentrate on the history \nof their particular service, not on the entirety of the U.S. Armed \nForces. The National Museum of American History holds the best \ncollection of American military artifacts, and it has the capability to \nrecount the whole story of the armed services. What better place to \ndevelop a comprehensive exhibit of our Nation's military service and \nits history than on The Mall at Washington, DC.\n  Our Nation's military history is special. It is unique from other \nmodes of history, such as social, cultural, political, or economic. It \ninvolves the ultimate sacrifice of one's life for his or her country. \nThese sacrifices were incurred in the hope of a better future for \ngenerations of Americans to come.\n  In this sense, an exhibit devoted to our Armed Forces is not only an \neducational tool. More important, it is a memorial to those who risked \ntheir lives, and those who ultimately gave their lives for our freedom. \nThe military has also touched many American families throughout our \nhistory. Millions of men and women have answered the Nation's call to \nduty, both as soldiers and citizens in support of war efforts. Having \nsuch a great impact on our society, a museum of American history should \nnot slight exhibit space devoted to the Armed Forces.\n  In decreasing the importance of military history at the museum, we \nare losing a significant segment of our proud history. Storage rooms \nare stocked with artifacts belonging to American military heroes, many \nof them used during important military engagements. These artifacts \nbring to our Nation's Capital a little excitement and drama from the \nbattlefields of Saratoga, the naval battles on Lake Champlain, the many \nfields of our Nation's Civil War, distant fields of Verdun, Normandy, \nKorea, Vietnam, and the gulf war. Many artifacts link us to\n\n[[Page S11069]]\n\nsignificant individuals throughout the span of our history: Gen. George \nWashington, Gen. Andrew Jackson, Gen. Ulysses S. Grant, Gen. John J. \nPershing, and Gen. Dwight Eisenhower, to name only a few.\n  To ignore these military events and these personalities makes \nmeaningless their struggles and the struggles of the people of this \nNation who enlisted their assistance to the military. That is true \nwhether it was service in the Armed Forces or in the support of them.\n  Now, if things go as planned, I fear that many of these items will be \nhidden from the American public despite the results of a recent \nvisitors survey. In this survey taken at the National Museum of \nHistory, it became evident that the Armed Forces' history hall was the \nsecond most popular exhibit area in the museum. Therefore, speaking on \nbehalf of most Americans, I urge the museum to reconsider its plan for \nthe military history hall.\n  We should look at this museum, responding to the needs of the \nAmerican people. If this survey shows that this is the second most \npopular exhibit in the museum, we should not have some revisionist at \nthe Smithsonian Institution taking away what the American people like \nand enjoy and depriving American people of understanding and \nvisualizing the sacrifice of American service men and women who do \nsacrifice with lives, with injuries, with time away from family for the \ndefense of freedom, so that not only can the American people enjoy \nfreedom, but the revisionist historians still have the intellectual \nenvironment in which they can do their work. But they ought to show \nmore appreciation of that sacrifice, and I think the plans for this \nmilitary history museum detract from that.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I want to call attention to a very \nencouraging development that was announced in Mexico City, yesterday.\n  For 35 years, the conflict in Guatemala between the insurgents there \nand the government has produced more than 100,000 deaths, many millions \nhave been maimed and seriously injured, and there has been scant hope \nthat the guerrilla warfare in that country might end.\n  Yesterday, in the offices of the Mexican Foreign Ministry, Gustavo \nPorras Catejon, who is the head of the Guatemalan Government \ndelegation, broke into a bear hug with the senior commander of the \nGuatemalan rebels, Rolando Moran. Although no cease-fire was signed \nyesterday, the warring parties--which have produced the longest \nconflict in this hemisphere--reached a historic agreement that finally \nholds out hope for a more hopeful future and a return of civil society \nto Guatemala.\n  According to the New York Times this morning, Guatemalan military \nleaders agreed to reduce their 46,000 troops by one-third next year. \nThey agreed to cut the military's budget by one-third by the year 1999. \nMilitary leaders also consented to an alteration of their mission from \none that did include domestic security control enforcement--that is, \nsecurity threats within Guatemala--to a mission limited to dealing with \nexternal threats, from outside Guatemala.\n  In 35 years of fighting, this is the most significant action we have \nseen that could lead to long-term peace. There are still many risks \nahead, particularly how to reincorporate insurgents into the Guatemalan \nsociety. The progress made yesterday, however, lays important \ngroundwork so that progress can be made in future weeks.\n  I commend the U.N. negotiators who helped to mediate between the \nGuatemalan Government and the rebel leaders. Yesterday's accord is the \nfifth that has emerged from these United Nations-mediated talks. The \nother agreements dealt with human rights, Indian rights, poverty and \nland tenure, and also to set up a commission to review some of the \ncrimes committed during the war.\n  The military's agreement to downsize its forces and its budget and \nits mission was coupled with a commitment by the government to create a \nnew police force with new recruits and retrain former officers to take \nover the army's domestic security functions.\n  Mr. President, there certainly will be skeptics who will not believe \nthe military will carry through with these commitments. I, too, have \nconcerns about how this transition may occur, but this is, \nnevertheless, an important turning point in Guatemalan history, given \nthe long history and troubling encounters that our own Government has \nhad with the Guatemalan Government.\n  American interests need to be encouraged with this move away from the \nextreme undue influence the military has previously exerted in affairs \nof state in that country.\n  I do welcome this news. I want my colleagues to know about it. I wish \nboth sides of this negotiation well in carrying out the agreement that \nthey announced in Mexico City yesterday.\n\n  Mr. LOTT addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, after a lot of good work by many Senators, I \nbelieve we have a unanimous consent agreement to allow us to go forward \non the maritime bill and to schedule votes.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the only amendments in \norder to H.R. 1350, the maritime security bill, be the six Grassley \namendments that are now filed at the desk; further, that the amendment \nrelative to rates be subject to a relevant second-degree amendment to \nbe offered by Senator Harkin; further, those amendments must be called \nup and debated during today's session; further, following the \ndisposition of all amendments, the bill be deemed read a third time.\n  I further ask unanimous consent that any votes ordered with respect \nto these amendments be postponed to occur in stacked sequence beginning \nat 5 p.m. on Tuesday, September 24, with 2 minutes for debate equally \ndivided before each vote, and at 4:30 p.m., there be 30 minutes equally \ndivided on the rates issue.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, it is my \nunderstanding that there will be 15 minutes for Senator Harkin before \nthe motion to table his second-degree amendment and 15 minutes for \nSenator Grassley before we move to table his first-degree amendment.\n  Mr. LOTT. That is correct.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, now that we have that agreement entered \ninto, I will note also there is a clearly understood gentlemen's \nagreement about how the votes will occur in terms of what will be \ntabled and what will not be tabled. We have had very clear \nunderstanding and discussion on that. We will work very carefully with \nSenators to make sure that understanding is adhered to.\n  With this unanimous-consent agreement, also I announce there will be \nno further recorded votes today. The next votes will occur on this \nissue at 5 o'clock on Tuesday. It is possible that other votes will \noccur during the day, Tuesday. We will come in session on Tuesday at \n9:30 a.m. We hope to be prepared to enter an agreement as to how we \nwill proceed on Tuesday, with the likelihood, the possibility of votes \nduring the day, but these stacked votes will not occur until 5 o'clock.\n  I yield the floor, Mr. President.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I am going to offer my first amendment. \nI am going to explain the amendment before I send it to the desk, Mr. \nPresident.\n  Some people think that once we pay for the U.S.-flag companies, the \n$2 million of corporate welfare that we pay per year, per vessel, with \nthis bill that we will not have to pay them again to carry actual war \nsustainment cargoes. I think the managers of the bill have, in speaking \nin opposition to some of\n\n[[Page S11070]]\n\nmy amendments, have suggested that we got this $2.1 billion corporate \nwelfare subsidy per ship, per vessel; that that is all we ever have to \npay.\n  But what we are paying for, if I can tell my colleagues, is the right \nand the obligation of those companies to have those ships available, or \nsimilar ships available, to do what the Department of Defense requires \nto meet our national security obligations.\n  But once those ships are brought in to meet our national security \nobligations--that is presumably when we have to deliver things during \nwar--then we have additional costs, because we will have to pay again \nto carry the actual war sustainment cargoes. So the fact that we just \npaid $2.1 million of corporate welfare subsidy per year, per vessel, \nthat that is the end of it, is simply not the case.\n\n  There are more charges. H.R. 1350 allows these carriers, even though \nthey have already received this heavy corporate welfare subsidy, they \nwill be able to charge to carry war sustainment materials at what is \ncalled ``fair and reasonable'' rates.\n  My amendment deals with the subject of fair and reasonable rates. \nUnfortunately, these rates are anything but fair and reasonable to the \ntaxpayers. That is what this Government is all about, getting the \ntaxpayers the most for their money, at least that is what it is \nsupposed to do.\n  OK. Why is this way not fair and reasonable to the taxpayers? It is \nbecause Congress failed in its responsibilities to the taxpayers to \ndefine ``fair and reasonable'' and has left to the Maritime \nAdministration the right to come up with its own definition of ``fair \nand reasonable.'' The problem with this is that the Maritime \nAdministration views its primary responsibility, not to the American \ntaxpayer, but instead to the welfare of U.S. maritime companies and \nseafarers.\n  Therefore, under the guise of ``fair and reasonable,'' taxpayers are \nforced to pay an extra $450 million a year above world market rates to \nship defense cargoes. When you include other agencies that can be \ninvolved in paying part of this bill, the taxpayers' bill runs up to \n$600 million a year.\n  Price gouging is even worse when we need these U.S. flags for war. \nDuring the Persian Gulf effort, they charged taxpayers an extra $625 \nmillion. Again, I want to quote other authorities. You might recall on \nSeptember 10, 1990, in U.S. News & World Report, an article entitled \n``Unpatriotic Profits.''\n\n       The Pentagon is miffed at what it feels is profiteering by \n     the operators of two U.S. cargo ships. Because the Navy is \n     required to use American bottoms before contracting with \n     foreign-owned ships, it paid the two U.S. carriers $70,000 to \n     send war materiel to the gulf. The comparable foreign bid was \n     $6,000.\n\n  We paid $70,000, when a comparable bid could cost only $6,000. In \nother words, if our people had been on their toes, or if the Maritime \nAdministration had been looking out for the taxpayers, we could have \nshipped that materiel for $64,000 less.\n  Before somebody tells me that the GAO concluded that neither U.S. \nflags nor foreign flags gouged taxpayers during the Persian Gulf war, I \nwant to remind anybody who might refer to that of two things: First, \nthe GAO auditing uses the liberal measure, such as ``fair and \nreasonable,'' not anything close to what the rate would be in a \ncompetitive market.\n  Second, the fact is, a U.S.-flag company did overcharge the Defense \nDepartment by $18 million for Persian Gulf war transport services. This \nmatter is still pending before the Armed Services Board of Contract \nAppeal. So the Defense Department is concerned about being overcharged \n$18 million.\n  The Defense Department has made no claims of overcharging by foreign-\nflag vessels. In fact, foreign flags typically cost one-half to one-\nthird the cost of comparable U.S.-flag vessels during the gulf war. \nOne-half to one-third less.\n  My amendment embraces taxpayers' protection similar to Buy-America \nlaws. For instance, under buy America, agencies are required to buy \nproducts from U.S. companies, but if the same product can be purchased \nfrom a foreign company at 6 percent less than what the U.S. company \ncharges, the Government can buy from foreign sources.\n  So you see, I am using definitions in law today. I am applying that \ndefinition in other sections of the code applying to other purchases of \nservice to the maritime industry as it is used in our war efforts.\n  My amendment uses the very same Buy-America market test of 6 percent. \nSo if my amendment were in place, then U.S.-flag companies, if they \nwould charge more than 6 percent above what can be secured from a \nforeign-flag vessel, the Government has a right to hire the foreign-\nflag vessel. This amendment will also prohibit a new scheme that allows \nU.S.-flag carriers to charge the Defense Department what they would \ncharge infrequent or spot customers.\n\n  Mr. President, let me confer here just a minute.\n  Mr. President, I am sorry. I was explaining my Buy-America amendment \nand saying we use the same 6 percent test. That would apply then to our \nmaritime industry, like that 6 percent test applies to others. So we \nwould prohibit, then, paying more than 6 percent above what competition \nwould charge.\n  My amendment also has a second portion by prohibiting a new scheme \nthat allows U.S.-flag carriers to charge the Defense Department what \nthey would charge infrequent or spot customers. My amendment makes \ncertain that this bill will require that U.S.-flag vessels give \ntaxpayers the same rate that they gave their volume customers like the \nJC Penneys of the world.\n  This idea also comes from a lot of activity of other Members in this \nbody to apply the same principle. For instance, in pharmaceuticals, you \nmay remember a lot of debate we had in this body on the purchase of \nMedicare pharmaceuticals, that Medicare would not be charged any more \nthan the largest volume price that the company would give to one of its \nother customers. We apply that principle here to this bill.\n  This amendment is not only essential for protecting the taxpayers, as \nthese other amendments have been--some of this is even law in other \nprovisions of the code--but, also, I offer this amendment because I \nthink it is necessary that we slowly and gradually nudge our U.S. \nmerchant marine into the competitive world.\n  We have done it with our railroads. We have done it with our \nairlines. We have done it with our truckers, my gosh, almost 20 years \nago. It is about time we start doing it with the maritime.\n  Our deficit-riddled Government can no longer afford to allow the \nmaritime lobby to block efforts to negotiate worldwide maritime \nreforms. There is another bill in this Congress sitting around here \nright now that has something to do with that. It may not pass because \nof the opposition of some, not all, of the maritime industry to \ncompeting in the real world out there. Then they will argue, won't \nthey, that they need subsidies because foreign competition is unfair. \nSo I say they cannot have it both ways.\n  Some time ago in a Journal of Commerce article entitled ``On the \nEvils of Maritime Subsidies,'' former Maritime Administrator, Adm. \nHarold E. Shear, stated--and I quote:\n\n       Nearly 50 years of subsidies have not prevented the demise \n     of the U.S. merchant marine . . . Subsidies do nothing more \n     than cause inefficiency, mediocrity, lack of incentive, \n     and dependence upon Uncle Sam.\n\n  That is the statement of a former maritime administrator. He has been \nthere. He has seen the entire industry. He has watched it over a period \nof time. That is what he had to say.\n  I feel that time is running out on the U.S.-flag merchant marine. \nThey must become competitive and give up government welfare. This \nlegislation deals with that.\n  Once again, I want to speak about several grassroots organizations \nlocated here in town that speak for the American people on wasteful \nGovernment spending, who support my efforts on this amendment and on \nthis bill. The Americans for Tax Reform ``strongly opposes the \ncontinuation of maritime subsidies in any form and strongly urges you \nto remove any such subsidies from the bill.''\n  We also have a letter from the Council of Citizens Against Government \nWaste, cosigned as well by the National Taxpayers Union. We also have a \nletter from Citizens for a Sound Economy.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have those printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n\n[[Page S11071]]\n\n\n\n\n                                     Americans for Tax Reform,\n\n                               Washington, DC, September 18, 1996.\n       Dear Senator: The ``Maritime Reform and Security Act of \n     1995'' is now pending in this Senate. Americans for Tax \n     Reform strongly opposes the continuation of commercial \n     maritime subsidies in any form and strongly urges you to \n     remove any such subsidies from the bill.\n       Numerous independent studies have illustrated the needless \n     and excessive cost of commercial maritime subsidies to the \n     U.S. taxpayer. For example, a 1989 Department of \n     Transportation report done by MIT entitled ``Competitive \n     Manning of U.S.-flag Vessels'' exposed serious waste in this \n     program and determined that maritime subsidies could be \n     reduced by half if there was, in fact a military need for \n     these ships. Even Al Gore has concluded that these subsidies \n     should be abolished.\n       Like many proponents of increased government intervention, \n     supporters of this legislation assert that it is necessary \n     for national security reasons. However, this legislation is \n     not likely to be at all effective in accomplishing that task. \n     In fact, the Department of Defense's Mobility Requirements \n     Study, Bottom Up Review Update concluded that even without \n     subsidies, the U.S. fleet would be adequate in the event it \n     was needed in time of conflict. If the United States military \n     can meets its requirements without these subsidies, why are \n     we asking the American taxpayer to foot the bill?\n       The subsidies contained in the Maritime Reform and Security \n     Act of 1995 are particularly egregious examples of a bloated \n     federal government spending taxpayers' money on a project \n     that is wholly unnecessary. This Congress has shown its \n     willingness to eliminate ridiculous pork-barrel spending. Why \n     is the Senate even considering extending a program that costs \n     American taxpayers more than $100,000 per job subsidized \n     annually?\n       Let's get rid of this wasteful and inefficient program once \n     and for all.\n           Sincerely,\n     Grover G. Norquist.\n                                                                    ____\n\n         Council for Citizens Against Government Waste, National \n           Taxpayers Union,\n                                               September 17, 1996.\n       Dear Senator: Most members of the 104th Congress have \n     prided themselves on ending welfare as we know it. \n     Unfortunately, the Senate may soon consider H.R. 1350, the \n     ``Maritime Security Act,'' which is nothing more than \n     corporate and labor union welfare. The Council for Citizens \n     Against Government Waste will key vote these votes for our \n     1996 Congressional Ratings. And because they do not key vote \n     per se, the National Taxpayers Union will weigh heavily these \n     votes for their analysis of the 104th Congress.\n       Taxpayer watchdog and public interest groups asked to \n     testify at public hearings to expose this welfare for \n     shipping companies, but were denied that opportunity. \n     Therefore, the undersigned organizations oppose this bill and \n     will key vote (or weigh heavily) final passage unless several \n     pro-taxpayer amendments to be offered by Sen. Grassley (R-\n     Iowa) and others are adopted.\n       According to an internal 1993 White House memo to President \n     Clinton from then-Assistant to the President for Economic \n     Policy Robert Rubin, the primary reason for this $1 billion \n     subsidy is to pay for the exorbitant salaries and benefits of \n     union seafarers.\n       In addition, this internal White House memo cited the \n     Defense Department's (DoD) argument that it needed as few as \n     20 U.S.-flag vessels. DoD also proposed a deficit-neutral \n     plan to pay for new subsidies. The DoD plan was supported by \n     the heads of 15 executive branch agencies. Only one-\n     Transportation Secretary Pena--opposed this deficit-neutral \n     plan because it ``provides less support than is sought by the \n     industry and its supporters.''\n       This is one of my reasons why we join opposition to this \n     bill, and will key vote final passage if the Senate fails to \n     pass Sen. Grassley's pro-taxpayer amendments, especially \n     those that provide protections to taxpayers from maritime \n     rate price gouging and prohibit subsidies from being used for \n     campaign and lobbying purposes.\n           Sincerely,\n     Council for Citizens Against Government Waste.\n     National Taxpayers Union.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n\n                                 Citizens for a Sound Economy,\n\n                               Washington, DC, September 16, 1996.\n       Dear Senator: On behalf of our 250,000 members across \n     America, I want to express our strong opposition to H.R. \n     1350, the so-called Maritime Security Act, and our strong \n     support for the amendments to this bill offered by Senator \n     Charles Grassley (R-Iowa). The amendments would limit the \n     cost to taxpayers from this proposal without weakening our \n     national defense.\n       The Act has less to do with maritime policy reform and \n     national security than with corporate welfare. Indeed, this \n     initiative would hand out a staggering $1 billion in \n     subsidies over the next decade to the private merchant marine \n     fleet, without any compelling national security interest or \n     other rationale. It would reward maritime special interests \n     that have been highly vocal on this issue--contributing some \n     $17 million to candidates for political office over the last \n     decade. For taxpayers and consumers, it is quite another \n     story. Assuming, conservatively, that the overall annual cost \n     of present maritime policies is $5 billion, the average cost \n     per seagoing job is no less than $375,000.\n       Yet, as Harold E. Shear, a retired navy admiral, concluded: \n     ``Nearly 50 years of subsidies have not prevented the demise \n     of the U.S. merchant marine. . . . Subsidies to nothing more \n     than cause inefficiency, mediocrity, lack of incentive and \n     dependence on Uncle Sam.'' We believe that Mr. Shear, who has \n     overseen the administration of these subsidies as maritime \n     administrator, knows what he is talking about.\n       Supporter of maritime subsidies--and H.R. 1350 in \n     particular--maintain that only a U.S.-owned, U.S.-flagged, \n     U.S.-manned commercial fleet can support the military in \n     emergencies. This argument is a red herring. First, as \n     Admiral Shear points out, the impact of subsidies on the U.S. \n     commercial fleet has been questionable at best. Moreover, \n     there is an enormous amount of capacity available on the open \n     market that can deliver more services more reliably at lower \n     cost. The Military Sealift Command made heavy use of foreign \n     ships staffed by non-U.S. citizens in the Gulf War. Only 17 \n     ships out of the 500 that went into the war zone during the \n     Gulf War were from the active U.S. flag commercial fleet--\n     only six of these had ever received the subsidies.\n       In 1993, 15 out of 16 government agencies supported an \n     option presented to President Clinton to limit these \n     subsidies. This is how now-Secretary of the Treasury Robert \n     Rubin described this option in his June 30, 1993 ``Decision \n     Memorandum on Maritime Issues.'':\n       ``Subsidies for the U.S. flag feet have always been \n     justified by their role in providing a sealift capacity for \n     use in military emergencies. With the end of the Cold War \n     DOD's sealift requirements have declined. Although DOD's \n     bottom-up review is not complete, the Secretary of Defense, \n     the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and the Commander \n     of the Transportation Command have already concluded that \n     future requirements will not exceed 20-30 liner vessels . . . \n     This opinion would meet DOD'S maximum military \n     requirements.'' [H.R. 1350 subsidizes 47 vessels.]\n       We strongly support Seanator Grassley's attempt to address \n     many of the more egregious problems with this bill. Senator \n     Grassley's seven amendments would:\n       Eliminate the provisions in H.R. 1350 that for the first \n     time would exempt U.S.-flag vessels from requisitioning, to \n     ensure that vessel operators who receive taxpayer funding \n     cannot escape their obligations in time of war;\n       Require that all subsidized U.S. vessels are utilized \n     before foreign-flag vessels may be hired;\n       Require subsidized seafarers to serve when needed or lose \n     their license to work on U.S.-flag vessels for five years;\n       Prohibit recipients of the handouts provided in the bill \n     from using the money to make contributions to political \n     campaigns. This would make it harder for the maritime lobby \n     to use taxpayer dollars to press Washington for more taxpayer \n     dollars;\n       Preclude subsidies from being used in so-called ``public \n     education'' efforts;\n       Require that war bonuses paid to seafarers be harmonized \n     with the war bonuses the Pentagon pays regular military \n     personnel. According to Persian Gulf War data, taxpayers can \n     be forced to pay seafarers war bonuses that are 50 times \n     greater than the war bonuses paid to active military \n     personnel;\n       Limit maximum vessel rates to no more than 6 percent above \n     world market rates. Currently, the Maritime Administration \n     appears to interpret ``fair and reasonable'' rates to mean \n     whatever rates cover the cost of operation plus a profit \n     margin of about 13 percent and keep as many seafarers in \n     business as possible.\n       The American taxpayer--who on average makes less than \n     $29,000 per year--is unlikely in the long term to reward \n     those politicians who grant a government subsidy of over \n     $50,000 a year to a commercial sailor who works no more than \n     six months per year.\n       We want to emphasize, that our endorsement of the Grassley \n     amendments should not, in any way, be construed as an \n     endorsement of the bill. We believe that, first, this bill \n     should be defeated. Should that prove impossible, we believe \n     the Grassley amendments must be passed in order to reduce \n     special interest subsidies and soften the blow to taxpayers.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                     Paul Beckner,\n                                                        President.\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. These letters speak to the issue of these votes and \nthey are scoring these votes in their index of whether or not you are a \nfiscally responsible Member of Congress.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Has the Senator proposed the amendment?\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. As a matter of efficiency, I would like to speak to the \nthree amendments that I was going to put forth--I will not put six \namendments forth--and then we would avoid the necessity of setting \namendments aside. As a matter of efficiency, I wanted to do that.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I wonder when we would be able to see the \namendments that the Senator is offering?\n\n[[Page S11072]]\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. We will give you copies of the amendments now, before I \nsend them to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from Iowa to \nproceed.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I am going to offer amendments as a \ncombined amendment, amendments that would prohibit the use of money in \nthese subsidies to the maritime companies from being used for lobbying \nor for campaign contributions. That will be one amendment.\n  I was going to offer it as two separate amendments, but they are so \nclosely related, I think they should be joined together. On behalf of \nthe amendment I am speaking about now, it would say that these funds \ncannot be used for lobbying or public education.\n  For years now, maritime subsidies, such as operating differential \nsubsidies, have funneled money into pro-maritime lobbying \norganizations. The Maritime Administration has historically calculated \na certain amount of the taxpayer subsidies to U.S.-flag carriers to \ncover funding for organizations such as the Transportation Institute \nand the Joint Maritime Congress.\n  I want to make clear to my colleagues that I do not have anything \nagainst the Transportation Institute or the Joint Maritime Congress, \nbut it should not be a cost of operation that the taxpayer subsidy is \ngoing to be used for. This should be funded by private money. It should \nnot be a cost of doing business figured into the subsidy.\n  My amendment makes certain that these funds cannot be misused for \nsuch lobbying or so-called public education purposes. There is not much \nthat I need to add. The Senate has debated this issue and voted on it \non other bills at other times, with the principle of my amendment \napplicable to the subject matter of that legislation, as my amendment \nis subject to the maritime legislation.\n  On November 9, 1995, the Senate voted on a measure to restrict the \nuse of public funds being used for lobbying. So every Senator is on \nrecord on this issue. Simply put, taxpayers should not be forced to pay \nfor lobbying by special interest groups.\n  Then the second part of this amendment would say that funds cannot be \nused for campaign contributions. Realizing how much maritime subsidies \nare really maritime union welfare, you can understand why I might argue \nif you are against taxpayer campaign finance, you should vote in favor \nof my amendment.\n  Former Congressman McCloskey, a Republican in the House of \nRepresentatives when he served in the Congress, was involved in this \nissue very deeply because he was high ranking on the subcommittee \ndealing with maritime. He said that seafarers' per capita campaign \ncontribution ran 500 times the average of the AFL-CIO member. You \nprobably know why. First of all, there are much higher salaries there \nfor it to be paid from. Also, the overburdened taxpayers have helped to \nsome extent, because to the extent there are subsidies involved in the \nsupport of the industry, seafarers can afford to be generous with \ncampaign contributions.\n  My amendment would prohibit this bill, H.R. 1350, the subsidies \ntherein, from being used for campaign contributions. Again, this is a \nsimple proposition. Taxpayers should not be forced to fund the campaign \ncontributions of special interest groups. Congress has already adopted \nsimilar campaign contribution restrictions on other funding bills. I \nhope my colleagues would support this measure, as well.\n\n\n                     Amendments Nos. 5393 and 5394\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I send these two amendments to the desk \nand ask that they be read.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, the last amendment I am going to propose \non this bill states that subsidized carriers must provide U.S. flag and \nU.S. crews for the entire defense sealift voyage. This amendment is \nresponding to the desire, presumably, behind the bill, presumably \nbehind cargo preference legislation for 50 years, a necessity of having \nAmerican ships and U.S. crews delivering our products, our materiel, to \nthe war zone. So it requires that we have U.S. flag and U.S. crews for \nthe entire defense sealift voyage.\n  Most believe that if we pay these U.S.-flag carriers this billion \ndollar corporate welfare subsidy over the next 10 years, they will \ncarry out their obligation to deliver military sustainment cargo all \nthe way into the war zone with their U.S.-flag commercial vessels with \nU.S. crews. Unfortunately, neither the VISA program, which is already \nin place, nor this bill, H.R. 1350, guarantees this. So the legislation \npurports that it is necessary, for our own national security, to have \nour own U.S. ships and our own U.S. crews to deliver to the war zone \nour war materiel. Yet, there is no guarantee from this legislation and \nno guarantee from VISA that this will be the situation.\n  What typically is the practice is that U.S.-flag vessels will deliver \nwar sustainment materiel to its commercial hub--that hub could be \nRotterdam, as an example--and then unload it onto foreign-flag, \nforeign-crewed vessels, which will then carry the materiel into the war \nzone.\n  But this bill does not correct this situation, the practice of using \nforeign vessels and foreign crews feeders. Now, as you have heard me \nsay, that doesn't bother me so much because, as a practical matter, \nthat is the way we get our goods there. But it seems to me that if we \nare going to have this subsidy of $2.1 million of corporate welfare for \neach ship and they get paid that just for the obligation they have to \nthe United States to be available in case of war, or to provide equal \nservice in the case of war, then they ought to be delivering the \nproduct to the war zone.\n  So this practice of transferring to foreign ships and foreign-crewed \nvessels caused us a lot of confusion about the extent of U.S.-flag \nsupport during the Persian Gulf war. Some believe that these U.S.-flag \ncommercial container vessels, which will be subsidized under H.R. 1350, \ndelivered 79 percent of our military cargo into the war zone. This is \njust not accurate.\n  We must not confuse the difference among the cargoes and the \nownership of vessels. Although much of the Persian Gulf cargoes were \ncarried by U.S. flags, many were Government-owned vessels, not the \ncommercial-owned container vessels that seek these taxpayer subsidies. \nIn reality, Government-owned and Government-chartered vessels deliver \n50 percent of these cargoes--primarily ammunition and military \nequipment. The remaining 29 percent of cargoes, which was primarily \nsustainment--that included food, clothing, and things like that--was \ntransported by U.S.-flag container vessels to some hub port around the \nworld. From there, most of the military sustainment cargoes were \nunloaded onto foreign-flag, foreign-crewed vessels, which made the \ndeliveries into the war zone. In short, virtually all of the military \nsustainment cargoes carried by U.S.-flag container vessels were \ntransferred to foreign flag/foreign crews to be delivered into the war \nzone. Foreign flag/foreign crews made about 500 voyages into the gulf \nwar zone. About 300 were feeder vessels that picked up cargo from U.S.-\nflag containers at a hub port. This practice will not change under this \nbill and VISA, as it is currently written.\n  In fact, this legislation will allow U.S.-flag carriers to meet its \nstage three obligation by substituting its U.S. flag/U.S. crews with \nforeign flag/foreign crews for the entire voyage, not just to the hub.\n  Now, what is even more incredible is the fact that these subsidized \nU.S.-flag carriers will be able to charge U.S.-flag premium rates, \nwhile providing the Department of Defense with foreign-flag/foreign-\ncrewed vessels.\n  Although the inference in this legislation may be that we will have \nAmerican crews with American-owned ships do the necessary job of \ntransporting our war materiel, and that may be an intent of the bill, \nit is not a certainty with the bill. It seems to me that we ought to \nnail that down for that $2.1 million corporate welfare subsidy.\n  Now, our distinguished majority leader, Senator Lott, on July 30, \n1996, stated this:\n\n       Our military needs a U.S.-flag merchant marine to carry \n     supplies to our troops overseas. We cannot--in fact, we must \n     not--rely upon foreign ships and foreign crews to deliver \n     supplies into hostile areas.\n\n  That was our own distinguished majority leader a little over a month \nago, speaking of the importance of this. My amendment, then, to H.R. \n1350 is necessary if we hope to achieve the objective stated on July \n30, 1996, by Senator Lott.\n  My amendment requires subsidized carriers to provide Uncle Sam with \nU.S.-flag vessels and U.S. crew members to carry the war materiel, and \nto carry it clearly into the war zone, not just to a commercially \nconvenient drop-off point, such as Rotterdam. In other words, if we are \npaying a $2.1 million subsidy to have these ships available, with the \nresponsibility to get the stuff to the war zone. If the philosophy \nbehind this legislation is that we should have this stuff carried to \nthe war zone on American ships with American crews, then obviously the \nbill ought to do that. Otherwise, it ought to be made very clear that \nwhat this bill is supposed to do, it really does not do that.\n  So you want to remember that maritime unions and carriers are \nconstantly arguing that we cannot trust foreign flag and foreign crews, \nand they say that is why we must subsidize American companies' ships \nwith this corporate welfare program that is before us.\n  So then it seems to me that, under this philosophy, taxpayers should \nbe able to insist that U.S.-flag carriers that receive this billion-\ndollar corporate subsidy over 10 years put their national defense \nresponsibilities ahead of their commercial interests in times of war.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 5395\n\n   (Purpose: To provide that United States-flag vessels be called up \n   before foreign flag vessels during any national emergency and to \nprohibit the delivery of military supplies to a combat zone by vessels \n                that are not United States flag vessels)\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY.

Mr. President, parliamentary inquiry. The other two \namendments are officially before the body as well.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I inform the Senator from Alaska and the Senator from \nHawaii that these are the amendments that I proposed. I can offer more. \nObviously, if I am going to offer more, I have to do it before 2 \no'clock. Am I right, Mr. President? These amendments must be offered by \n2 o'clock?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Any amendments to this bill would have to be \noffered by 5 p.m. today.\n  Mr. STEVENS. If the Senator will yield, that includes time for \nSenator Harkin to offer his amendment.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I am going to give up the floor. I just wanted to speak \nto the fact that there might be some reason that I cannot think of \nright now to offer another amendment. I do not really anticipate doing \nit. So I yield the floor. I would be happy to respond to questions or \nengage in debate. I should give my opponents the courtesy of listening \nto their objections to my amendments. Whatever the floor managers at \nthis point want to do, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, we have not had a chance to study the \namendments. I only have the first one in my hand now.

Mr. President, on behalf of the Senator from Iowa [Mr. \nHarkin], I send to the desk an amendment to the Grassley amendment No. \n5393, and this is offered in the second degree.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       In lieu of the matter proposed to be inserted, insert the \n     following:\n\n     SEC.   . OCEAN FREIGHT CHARGES.\n\n       (a) In General.--Notwithstanding any other provision of \n     law, the Secretary of Transportation shall finance any ocean \n     freight charges for food or export assistance provided by the \n     Federal Government for any fiscal year, to the extent that \n     such charges are greater than would otherwise be the case \n     because of the application of a requirement that agricultural \n     commodities be transported in United States-flag vessels.\n       (b) Application of Other Acts.--Subsections (c), (d), and \n     (e) of section 901d of the Merchant Marine Act, 1936 (46 \n     U.S.C.

App. 1241f(b)).\n\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, pursuant to the agreement, this amendment \nwill be discussed on Tuesday at 4:30.\n  Mr. President, if I may, during the time available, respond to the \namendments as submitted by Senator Grassley, many critics of the U.S.-\nflag merchant marine have suggested that the U.S. military rely on \nforeign-controlled and foreign-flag vessels for sealift because they \nmaintain that to ship goods on foreign vessels would be less expensive. \nHowever, I would like to suggest that to do this would subject our \nArmed Forces to a highly unreliable source of sealift and supply. This \nwould leave the United States at the mercy of price gouging by foreign-\nflag vessels who would have a captive client.\n  For example, in the recent war in the Persian Gulf, 80 percent of the \ncargo was carried on American flags. We had to pull out ships from all \nover the seven seas. But we cannot provide 100 percent coverage of all \ncargo. It was not possible. Our fleet was not large enough. Therefore, \nto carry the remaining 20 percent, we had to rely on foreign vessels.\n  These statistics that I am about to present, Mr. President, have been \nconfirmed by the GAO and confirmed by the Department of Defense. The \naverage cost of Desert Shield-Desert Storm shipping by foreign flag was \n$174 per ton. The average cost for Desert Shield-Desert Storm shipping \nby U.S. flagships was $122 per ton. It was $52 per ton cheaper on \nAmerican ships. When shipping was particularly essential, when the \ndemand for shipping space became an urgent matter, foreign-flag vessels \nbegan to gouge the U.S. military. And I am going to read examples of \nthis.\n  During this period, the vessel Green Lake, which is an American \nvessel, was paid $31,500 per day to charter. The vessel capacity was \n400,416 square feet. For each dollar that we paid, we carried 12.71 \nsquare feet. We were able to purchase 12.71 square feet for $1.\n  In the case of the Italian vessel Jolly Smeraldi, we paid a $29,000 \nper day charter cost. The vessel capacity is 97,427 square feet. And \nfor each dollar that we provided this Italian ship, it provided us 3.35 \nsquare feet as compared to the American at 12.71.\n  The Saudi Riyada, we paid that company $25,000 per day. The Saudi \nRiyada evidently is owned by the Government of Saudi Arabia. The vessel \ncapacity is 141,000. And for each dollar that we paid the Saudi Riyada, \nwe were able to use 5.64 square feet.\n  I could go on and read dozens of cases of this sort. But in each case \nwe got a bargain from American steamship companies, whereas, on the \nother hand, these companies, these foreign vessels, were gouging us.\n  For example, it might interest Americans to know that the Norwegian \nvessel Arcade Eagle was given $16,000 per day by charter, and they \ncarried 55,000 square feet of cargo which comes down to 3.43 square \nfeet per dollar. The usual charge of the Arcade Eagle would be $8,000 \nper day for charter. But in this case, because they knew that the \nUnited States had no choice but to rely upon foreign vessels, they \ndoubled their cost. And in each case, whenever we called upon foreign \nvessels to help us carry cargo to this war zone, they\n\n[[Page S11075]]\n\njacked up the price because they knew we had no choice.\n  What I am trying to say is that notwithstanding the criticism we \nmight hear, we get a better deal from American vessels than from any \nforeign-flag vessel. In the case of the U.S. ship Green Lake, for \nexample, for $1 we had more than 12 square feet of cargo space. For the \nPanamanian ship Takoradi, for each dollar we paid that company, we got \n2.85 square feet of cargo space.\n  Second, one of the amendments would require that any cargo carried by \nAmerican vessels must continue on into the war zone. This would take \naway the military flexibility that is so necessary to the military \nleaders for one reason. Not all harbors are deep enough. Most of the \nAmerican ships are the larger ones, the tankers, the huge tankers that \ncan carry a large amount of cargo, and they require deep harbors. These \nare deep draft ships. These are not small ships.\n  For example, it would be impossible for the Green Lake to go to \nSomalia. That was one of the war zones. It would be impossible for the \nGreen Lake to go into the harbor in Bosnia. Therefore, the Green Lake \nwould carry the cargo to the nearest major port, in the case of the \nBosnian war, in Italy and there place the cargo on smaller American or \nforeign vessels to finish up the journey. And so this amendment which \nwould require military leaders to charter ships that will carry a cargo \nfrom point of departure to point of arrival without any stoppage would \ntake away the flexibility that military leaders require.\n  These amendments just make no sense, Mr. President. And finally, the \namendment proposed relating to campaign contributions and educational \nprograms. The amendment says that if any company receives subsidies, \nthat company may not involve itself in providing campaign contributions \nor involving themselves in political campaigns.\n  There are many subsidy programs in the United States. Farmers receive \nlarge amounts of subsidy. They join the Farm Bureau. Does this mean \nthat the Farm Bureau can no longer participate in political campaigns? \nDoes it mean that it cannot make political contributions? If this \namendment were to be applied to all subsidy recipients, and many \nsubsidies are for research grants--just about every university in the \nUnited States receives some sort of grant. Some are large; some are \nsmall. Does this mean that the professor who is conducting the research \nprogram is denied his constitutional right to make a campaign \ncontribution?\n  These amendments at first glance may appear to be reasonable, \nrational, and very American, but when one analyzes the amendments, they \nbegin to bring up problems that I do not think the author intended.\n  So I hope that when the time comes on Tuesday to determine whether to \naccept or to deny these amendments my colleagues will vote against \nthem.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, on July 30, 1996, Senator Lott said, and \nI quote, ``We cannot, in fact, we must not, rely on foreign ships and \nforeign crews to deliver supplies into hostile areas.''\n  This is the impetus for one of the three amendments that I have that \nrequire American crews and American bottoms subsidized by this bill, to \ncarry war materiel, carry it the entire way to a war zone. And this \nlegislation does not require this.\n  I know it is the intent of the legislation that American bottoms and \nAmerican crews be used most of the time, or maybe all the time. That \nmay be the intent. But it is not required. And Senator Lott being one \nof the biggest proponents of this legislation stated this. Since this \nis his measure of the importance of our maritime industry, I felt we \nshould bring that issue here in the way of my amendment.\n  Now, I want to speak maybe just for 3 or 4 minutes in response to the \namendment that has not been debated but has been offered by the Senator \nfrom Hawaii for my colleague from Iowa, Senator Harkin.\n  I know there is going to be an opportunity for us to speak on this \nTuesday under the unanimous consent, but I would like to express this \nthought about this idea of my colleague from my State.\n  This happens to be the second time that my colleague from Iowa has \ntried to undercut my efforts to obtain sanity and control over the way \nwe shovel union welfare and corporate welfare funds to the U.S. \nmaritime industry and the merchant marines. The last time was 6 years \nago exactly.\n  The purpose of this amendment is to have the U.S. Department of \nTransportation pay the cargo preference costs rather than the \nAgriculture Department for the food programs of the Agriculture \nDepartment. I do not think we can find any fault with the \nTransportation Department paying it instead of the Agriculture \nDepartment, because it is a transportation cost and it is not the cost \nof food. But it does not accomplish anything and is just a bookkeeping \nissue.\n  So I said then, 6 years ago, and I say again today, it does not make \nany difference which agency pays for cargo preference--either way \ntaxpayers get ripped off. So this amendment by my colleague from Iowa \nwould continue to allow the maritime labor unions to rip off taxpayers.\n  I read in debate yesterday from this Rubin-Clinton memo. The Rubin-\nClinton memo had been sent to every Senator last year by Citizens \nAgainst Government Waste. I had it delivered again to each office \nyesterday.\n  In short, Secretary Rubin, in his memo to President Clinton on this \nissue of subsidies for the maritime industry, President Clinton's own \nCabinet people argue that maritime subsidies are simply aimed at paying \nhigh-priced seafarers. They argued that the maritime subsidies are \nlittle more than a jobs bill, and it would be unfair to give special \ntreatment to seafarers unless President Clinton would be willing to \ngive other workers facing job losses the same type of subsidies.\n  The amendment I have on this bill is supported by taxpayers' \norganizations because it goes to the heart of wasteful maritime \nsubsidies. My amendment requires Congress to define the legal term \n``fair and reasonable rates.''\n  So, if Senator Harkin's amendment would be adopted, then that would \nundercut the pressure for Congress to define what is fair and \nreasonable, because we have left that definition to the maritime \nindustry. The Maritime Administration has been more concerned about the \nmaritime industry and the maritime unions, protecting them, than \nprotecting the taxpayers. So they have a very liberal ``fair and \nreasonable rate'' definition.\n  So, in my amendment, which Senator Harkin has offered to amend, we \nuse the same type of definition for taxpayers' protection that are \nunder Buy-America laws, which are already on the books. In short, such \nas with Buy America, agencies can buy products, or in maritime cases it \nwould be services, if U.S. companies are charging taxpayers 6 percent \nmore than foreign companies. My amendment might save the taxpayers $500 \nmillion a year.\n  Now, for $500 million a year I use as a source--I honestly can \ndocument $500 million. There is, in every budget since Darman was \nDirector of the Office of Management and Budget, a figure on what cargo \npreference costs are. We never had it in previous budgets. At least we \nhave a dollar figure on it now.\n  So, Senator Harkin's amendment in the final analysis does not save \nthe taxpayers one thin dime. It merely says this is going to be paid \nfor out of transportation rather than out of the Agriculture \nDepartment. So I urge my colleagues to oppose this amendment.\n  I do not think we should fool ourselves. This amendment will not help \nfarmers who happen to be taxpayers as well. My amendment gets at saving \ntaxpayers the money, not just saying who is going to pay for the cost \nof cargo preference.\n  Our appropriating committees will simply take money out of funds \nallocated under agriculture to buy food for those starving overseas, \nwhich is the agriculture program involved, and they will take whatever \nthe cargo preference cost is and give it to the Transportation \nDepartment. Farmers will\n\n[[Page S11076]]\n\nnot sell more food under this amendment. It will not save the taxpayers \nany money. And this is the reason this amendment should be opposed.\n\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I wish I had the luxury of the Senator \nfrom Iowa to make statements that he just made. The Senator from Hawaii \nand I have the duty to also manage the defense budget. We know what it \ncosts to maintain ships and crew them 12 months a year, to pay for the \nconstruction of the ships in order to have them available to send food \nand supplies to our service men and women when they are at war. We can \nno longer afford that. We have had to abandon the program started by \nPresident Eisenhower. As I said on the floor right here last night, the \nbuild and lease programs where we built the ships and we leased them to \nother people during peacetime and we used them during war, it cost us a \ngreat deal more than the system does now.\n  I am sad that these great organizations that support the concept of \nprotecting the taxpayers have been misled again. But they have been \nmisled. If we followed the advice of the Senator from Iowa, we would be \nspending billions more--billions. We did spend billions. We have cut it \ndown now to where it is going to be less--I have said $150 million less \nthan the program costs us today--if we pass this bill.\n  This amendment of the Senator would require that U.S. ships carry \nGovernment cargo at rates no more than 6 percent higher than the lowest \nrate charged by any foreign-flagged vessel, regardless of the quality \nof the vessel or whether or not that vessel could even handle the \ncargo. These foreign-flagged vessels operate under flags of \nconvenience. They do not meet our safety requirements, environmental \nstandards, and they do not pay decent wages. Their seamen left the \nships when we had them under contract to go to the Persian Gulf. They \nabandoned their ships. They would not go into harm's way.\n  Cargo preference accounts for only 1\\1/4\\ percent of all commercial \nand Government agricultural exports. The Senator from Iowa is \nrepresenting farmers very well. I understand that. We represent the \ntaxpayers. I think the fact that these taxpayers' organizations have \nbeen misled by things like my friend from Iowa has said is what gets us \ninto so much trouble with these organizations.\n  The 1997 budget estimate for cargo preference is $70 million--$70 \nmillion. The nationally recognized accounting firm of Nathan Associates \nestimated the U.S. Treasury receives back $1.26 for every $1 spent on \ncargo preference. The extra 26 cents comes from the fact that the U.S. \ntaxes would not be paid if we do not have a U.S. fleet and U.S. crew. \nIn other words, we are actually saving the taxpayers' money by using \ncargo vessels that pay to support our system. And we hire people who \npay taxes.\n  If you want to hire foreign ships and foreign crews, you do not get \nany taxes, you do not get compliance with Federal standards. We have \nall sorts of problems, including the fact that the crews abandon ship \nwhen they have to go into war zones. That has to be figured in, but the \ncost to the taxpayers, if we follow the approach that is outlined by \nthe Senator from Iowa, would be to go back to building the ships, keep \nthem standing in some port, paying people to sit on them, waiting until \nthe time we have to go to war.\n\n  We have worked out a better system. This system is being designed in \nthe interest of the taxpayers. The GAO estimates without the cargo \npreference, the U.S. fleet would shrink dramatically. In other words, \nwe would have no vessels available for sealift. None. We can predict \nhow long it would be. We can actually tell you exactly when there would \nno longer be any ships, and we would be completely dependent upon \nforeign ships to maintain our military posture. Imagine that, the last \nsuperpower of the world would have to go begging around the world in \ntime of crisis to find some way to send supplies to our people.\n  The GAO found that we would lose 90 percent of the bulk cargo fleet, \n80 percent of the cargo vessels, 75 percent of the intermodal vessels \nand 35 percent of the tankers. That is a vast majority of our fleet if \nwe followed the advice of the Senator from Iowa.\n  I tell the Senate again, I don't know why we have to, as Members of \nthe Senate, be threatened--threatened--by the taxpayers unions. That is \nwhat the Senator is doing. It is already on a sheet. Every one of us is \ngoing to be rated now by a group that is being misled. If they want to \ncome to me, I will show them what it will cost to build a fleet, I will \nshow them what it costs to maintain the fleet, because we know what it \nused to cost us. We did that in the period after World War II. Then we \nwent into the Eisenhower build and lease program, and we know what that \ncost. But it was the best system available then.\n  We have a system now, we have an agreement from our people that they \nwill provide us, just like we provide airplanes now. Mr. President, we \ndo not maintain a full air cargo fleet in our military any longer. We \nhave a CRAFT program, the civil reserve air fleet. We use our planes \nthat are cargo planes--the best in the world--manned by Americans, \nbuilt by Americans, owned by Americans, and they are available to us.\n  That is exactly what we are going to do now with the maritime cargo \nfleet. We are going to deal with U.S. vessels. We have this system, and \nit is going to cost the least amount in the history of the United \nStates to provide it. The Senator from Iowa has the audacity to tell me \nthat I am going against the taxpayers of the United States to put \nforward this bill to provide that system. I say this is the kind of \nthing that destroys the confidence in the Congress, to have people of \nthis country told that we are wasting money when we devise a system \nthat brings back $1.26 for every dollar we spend in order to keep this \nreserve military sealift capacity available.\n  I am sorry to say, unfortunately, under the agreement, we don't have \nany time to answer the Senator on Tuesday. Both Senators from Iowa will \nhave 15 minutes to explain their amendments, and we have the right to \ntable them. So I hope we have the confidence of this Senate that the \nSenator from Hawaii and I normally enjoy, and that is, that we will not \nmislead the Congress, we will not mislead the people of the United \nStates, and we are not going to mislead the taxpayers.\n  The people misleading the taxpayers are these people who are coming \nforward with these fallacious arguments and presenting figures that \ncannot hold up. These have been studied by independent people, by the \nnationally recognized accounting firms, by the Government Accounting \nOffice that we rely on as a branch of the Government, and they have \ntold us this system is sound.\n  What the Senator from Iowa is trying to do is kill this bill. Any one \nof the amendments, if they are adopted this late in the Congress, sends \nthis bill back to the House, and it is dead. So I intend to oppose all \nof his amendments and oppose them for what they are: Killer amendments. \nThat is what they are, killer amendments, and that is his design--to \nkill. He has tried several times to kill the cargo preference concept. \nWe back it because it is the most efficient way to handle export of \nproducts produced by farmers from the farm belt of this country, great \npeople. We buy their grain and we ship it abroad on a humanitarian \nconcept.\n\n  The Senator objects to the fact we are using American ships, American \ncrews, American management to do that. The reason we use the American \nfleet is that we must have it in the event of war. Without our program, \nwe would not have it. We would not have any, and I, in my capacity as a \nmember of the Commerce Committee, support the cargo preference concept \nbecause I know, in my capacity as chairman of the Defense \nAppropriations Committee, if we do not, we have to put much more of our \nmoney that could be used to maintain our Army, our Air Force, our Navy, \nour Marine Corps, into maintaining a ready fleet to carry our goods to \nsupport our people if we ever have to deploy them.\n  My staff points out if this bill is killed, it will leave intact the \nmore expensive system we are trying to replace. That is the point I am \ntrying to make, too. The bill before us has been the one we have been \nworking on, the Senator and I, now for two decades trying to put \nforward a concept like this.\n\n[[Page S11077]]\n\n We finally got a bill out of the House. I want to see it go to the \nPresident and signed before this Congress is over.\n  I will come back at a later time and address the other amendments of \nthe Senator from Iowa. Unfortunately, Mr. President, I must leave the \nfloor, as the Senator from Iowa did last night several times. I must \nleave for an hour. I will be back at 1:30.\n  Mr. INOUYE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Hawaii.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, if I may comment upon the very eloquent \nstatement made by my colleague from Alaska on cargo preference. Cargo \npreference is not new. In fact, every nation on this globe that has a \nmaritime fleet has cargo preference. The United States was the last \nnation to adopt cargo preference as part of its economic policy.\n  How does cargo preference operate? Whenever we buy oil from Saudi \nArabia, the requirement is if you are going to buy Saudi oil, it will \nbe shipped on Saudi ships, and the only time an American ship may carry \nthat Saudi oil is when there are no Saudi ships available. We have no \nsay as to how much they are going to charge for the shipment of that \ncrude oil.\n  Whenever we buy automobiles from Toyota, Mitsubishi, and God knows \nwhat else, they come in on Japanese ships, not on American vessels, \nbecause that is part of the cargo preference agreement.\n  Our cargo preference laws are very limited. It applies only to \nhumanitarian goods, agricultural products. For example, when starvation \nwas rampant in Ethiopia, the United States, like most other nations, \nresponded by sending food. Under our laws, it says that 50 percent of \nthose products must be shipped on American vessels; the other 50 \npercent on foreign vessels. We are not like other countries that would \nsay every pound of grain must be shipped on American vessels. We say 50 \npercent. There are those who are suggesting either to wipe this out or \nbring it down to 25 percent.\n  What are the consequences? Imagine American grain on a Russian vessel \nshipped to Ethiopia--and this is not a hypothetical, Mr. President, it \nis done--with the red flag. And you can just hear the stevedores \nunloading American grain, an American gift and saying, ``Thank you, \nSoviet Union.'' ``Thank you, Russia.'' That is how it appears. By cargo \npreference, we are keeping our fleet alive.\n\n  Mr. President, I think we should remind ourselves that at the end of \nWorld War II we were the superpower when it came to shipping. No other \nnation came close to us. The British fleet was at the bottom of the \nAtlantic and the Pacific Oceans. The Russian fleet was nonexistent. The \nGerman fleet was nonexistent. The Japanese fleet was nonexistent. We \nwere the shipping nation of the world.\n  Today, Mr. President, we have less than 350 ships. We are No. 15. The \nChinese have more ships, the Greeks have more ships, the Italians have \nmore ships, the British have more ships. In order to bring down the \ncost of running this Government and taking off the burden from our \ntaxpayers, we have strange laws.\n  This might interest you, Mr. President. The mail that is now being \ncarried from our shores to our NATO allies, that is, in Europe, one \nwould assume would be carried on American vessels. Russian mail from \nRussia comes in on Russian ships. British mail from England would come \nin on British ships. Japanese mail would come in on Japanese ships.\n  So you would think that American letters from here to Europe and from \nEurope to America would be on American ships. No, it is not so. We open \nit up to bid. The lowest bidder will carry the cargo and the ships and \nthe mail. The shipping company that carries our mail is the Polish \nSteamship Company. It is owned by Poland. It is not a private steamship \ncompany. It is owned by the Government of Poland, fully subsidized. How \ncan you expect any American vessel to bid against the Polish Steamship \nCompany? At one time it was the Russian Steamship Company.\n  These steamship companies are either fully subsidized or partially \nsubsidized by their nation. The United States has to compete in that \nplaying field. So the small amount that we set aside for cargo \npreference is not only wise, it is not only prudent, it is absolutely \nnecessary because without that you will find that many of our ships \nwould decide to go out of business.\n  I think we should also keep in mind that our ships, unlike those \nships of other countries, pay good wages. I do not suppose Americans \nwould expect our merchant seamen to work for minimum wage. I do not \nsuppose that we American taxpayers want our merchant seamen to have no \nhealth benefits, no pension programs. I think they are entitled to \npension programs like other workers. They are entitled to at least a \nminimum wage like other workers.\n  Most of the sailors on foreign vessels do not match our minimum wage. \nAnd we expect, under this amendment, to have our ships pay a rate that \nwould require the companies to pay our merchant fleet seamen less than \nminimum wage? It is outrageous. It is demeaning.\n  Mr. President, I hope that we will join our chairman from Alaska to \noppose all of these amendments. Cargo preference is not bad. It makes \ngood sense. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I know that my colleague from Alaska had to leave the \nfloor for an hour, and legitimately so, because he has important duties \nelsewhere. But I want to take time to respond to the sadness he \nexpressed that organizations like the National Taxpayers Union would be \nconcerned about the waste in this bill, as they see it and as I see it, \nthe fact that we should not have corporate welfare subsidies, and that \nthey are reflecting their membership at the grassroots level, that he \nis sad for that, or at least for what he considers to be a negative \nimpact that that process has on the legislative process.\n\n  He should not be saddened in any way because basically what we are \ntalking about here is a constitutional right that is in the first \namendment. It is in the first amendment and about which you do not hear \nmuch. You always hear about freedom of speech, freedom of religion, \nfreedom of press, but you do not read much about the right to petition \nyour Government for redress of grievances.\n  All these organizations are doing, in opposing this legislation, is \nspeaking for their grassroots membership who feel that Washington is \nwasting money on a corporate welfare subsidy. We ought to encourage \nthat process. We should not be saddened by that process. It is what has \nmade America great for the 209-year history of our constitutional \nGovernment. I want to encourage it.\n  If I had letters from the National Taxpayers Union in opposition to \nthis legislation, that is not any more illegitimate than the Senator \nfrom Alaska or the Senator from Hawaii having letters from the maritime \nindustry, the individual corporations, or from the maritime unions in \nsupport of the legislation.\n  Everybody has a right to voice their opinion on legislation. We ought \nto spend our time listening and encouraging that process. We should not \nbe discouraging that process. The more open Government can be, the \nstronger our Government will be. And there is so much cynicism at the \ngrassroots that we do not listen to our people that it is weakening the \nvery foundation of our system of representative government. Each one of \nus has a responsibility to encourage that process of representative \ngovernment and to listen.\n  It is better to listen to a Taxpayers Union member in my State of \nIowa than their national organization. It is better to listen to the \nindividual who does not belong to any organization than it is to listen \nto organizations in town. But the right of association guarantees those \nsame people at the grassroots who feel that they do not have time to \nwork the governmental process to work through organizations. That is \njust as true of the members of the National Taxpayers Union as it is \nthe employees of John Deere in Waterloo, IA, working through their UAW \npeople in Washington, DC; albeit, it is better if each of us listened \nto the individual and not have it filtered through the organization.\n  The issue was brought up by the Senator from Alaska of how this saves \nmoney. If you compared the cost of existing programs, this bill will \ncost less.\n\n[[Page S11078]]\n\n I do not dispute that. I have never disputed that. But can we spend \neven less and get the job done? I feel we can. And if we can, we \nshould.\n\n  It was disputed that I had the authority to use numbers for savings. \nWe know what cargo preference costs. We know that because after my \nrailing about it for several years, the Office of Management and Budget \nstarted ferreting out the information where it is hidden in the \nappropriations of different departments, and bringing it together in \none figure. It is in the President's budget document. So that $600 \nmillion figure I did not make up. It is a study figure from the \nPresident's budget.\n  Now, whether or not these good-Government groups like the National \nTaxpayers Union should be sending these letters, I suggest to the \nleadership of this bill that it would not have been necessary for that \npoint of view to be considered this late in the legislative process. \nThey and other organizations in opposition to this legislation, a year \nago, asked to be part of a public hearing where only the proponents of \nthis legislation were allowed to appear--only the proponents of the \nlegislation. The opposition was not heard.\n  If the committee process had worked the way it should have worked--\nwithout having both pro and con in a hearing, to have a fair hearing. \nThey tried to get a second hearing since then, and for a long period of \ntime was promised such a hearing, but it did not come off. So these \nproblems would not have existed in getting their point of view out if \nthey had been heard in the first place.\n  So that it is plain, very plain that these organizations did ask to \nappear. From the director of government relations of Citizens for a \nSound Economy, I will read part of this letter:\n\n       To date, the subcommittee on Surface Transportation of the \n     Merchant Marine has held one hearing on the act, failing to \n     invite any of the many individuals and organization opposed \n     to the bill. We believe that consideration of the act without \n     the benefit of open debate will prevent the Senate from \n     making an informed decision in this matter.\n\n  Americans for Tax Reform say:\n\n       I strongly urge you to hold hearings on this entire bill \n     before the full committee in which those opposed to continued \n     maritime subsidies are allowed to state their views.\n\n  We also have Citizens Against Government Waste. To the chairman of \nthe committee:\n\n       Therefore, we urge that no Senate consideration of either \n     H.R. 1350 or S. 1139 be allowed until the first Senate \n     commerce committee holds open hearings allowing independent \n     experts and critics to testify.\n\n  Then a letter from my colleagues:\n\n       We therefore request that before either H.R. 1350 or S. \n     1139 be considered by the Senate that you hold a series of \n     full committee hearings to explore the work devoted to the \n     Rubin memo and the MIT study, and to hear the concerns and \n     successes.\n\n  Suggestions from a growing number of critics of maritime subsidies--a \nletter on March 12 of this year was sent to the chairman of the \ncommittee and signed by Bob Dole, John Ashcroft, Don Nickles, Nancy \nKassebaum, Hank Brown, myself, Jon Kyl, Jesse Helms, and Rod Grams, the \ndistinguished Presiding Officer right now. We did not get into the \nhearing room, obviously.\n  I ask unanimous consent these letters be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                     Americans for Tax Reform,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, May 10, 1996.\n     Hon. Lary Pressler,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Pressler: The so-called ``Maritime Reform and \n     Security Act of 1995'' (H.R. 1350 and S. 1139) is now pending \n     in the Senate--without a single opportunity for those who \n     oppose the continued corporate maritime subsidies in the bill \n     to testify before the Subcommittee on Surface Transportation \n     and Merchant Marine. Americans for Tax Reform strongly \n     opposes the continuation of commercial maritime subsidies in \n     any form and strongly urges you to hold hearings before the \n     full Commerce Committee on all of the provisions of this \n     bill.\n       Numerous independent studies have illustrated the needless \n     and excessive cost of commercial maritime subsidies to the \n     U.S. taxpayer. For example, a 1989 Department of \n     Transportation report done by MIT entitled ``Competitive \n     Manning on U.S.-flag Vessels'' exposed serious waste in this \n     program and determined that maritime subsidies could be \n     reduced by half if there was, in fact a military need for \n     these ships. Even Al Gore has concluded that these subsidies \n     should be abolished.\n       Like many proponents of increased government intervention, \n     supporters of this legislation assert that it is necessary \n     for national security reasons. However, S. 1139 is not likely \n     to be at all effective in accomplishing that task. In fact, \n     the Department of Defense's Mobility Requirements Study, \n     Bottom UP Review Update concluded that even without \n     subsidies, the US shipping fleet would be adequate in the \n     event it was needed in time of conflict. If the United States \n     military can meet its requirements without these subsidies, \n     why are we asking the American taxpayer to foot the bill?\n       The subsidies contained in the Maritime Reform and Security \n     Act of 1995 are particularly egregious examples of bloated \n     federal government spending taxpayers' money on a project \n     that is wholly unnecessary. This Congress has shown its \n     willingness to eliminate ridiculous pork-barrel spending. Why \n     are you even considering extending a program that costs \n     American taxpayers more than $100,000 per job subsidized \n     annually?\n       I strongly urge you to hold hearings on this entire bill \n     before the full committee, in which those opposed to \n     continued maritime subsidies are allowed to state their case.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 Scott P. Hoffman,\n     Director of Operations.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, March 12, 1996.\n     Hon. Larry Pressler,\n     Chairman, Senate Commerce Committee.\n       Dear Chairman Pressler: Last year, you joined us in a \n     letter to Budget Chairman Domenici calling for the \n     ``elimination of wasteful maritime programs.'' As you can see \n     from the enclosed materials, public interest groups also \n     oppose maritime subsidies, including:\n     (1) Citizens Against Government Waste\n     (2) National Taxpayers Union\n     (3) Citizens for a Sound Economy\n     (4) Heritage Foundation\n     (5) Competitive Enterprise Institute\n     (6) Cato Institute\n     (7) Progressive Policy Institute of the Democratic Leadership \n         Conference, and\n     (8) Ralph Nader's Essential Information Group\n       Unfortunately, these and other critics of maritime \n     subsidies were not called to testify at the single hearing by \n     the Subcommittee on Surface Transportation and Merchant \n     Marine. Now H.R. 1350 and S. 1139, the Maritime Reform and \n     Security Act of 1995, are pending on the Senate Calendar.\n       The committee was denied the benefit of important \n     independent analyses of maritime subsidies, including the MIT \n     report entitled ``Competitive Manning on U.S.-flag Vessels'' \n     which exposed serious waste and determined maritime subsidies \n     could be cut in half.\n       The committee also was denied the benefit of extensive work \n     by 16 executive branch agencies summarized in the 1993 \n     ``Decision Memorandum on Maritime Issues'' from Robert Rubin \n     to President Clinton. Fifteen of 16 executive branch agencies \n     concluded that as few as 20 vessels--not 50--should be \n     subsidized. The memo states that the ``Secretary of Defense, \n     the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and the Commander \n     of the Transportation Command have already concluded that \n     future requirements will not exceed 20-30 liner vessels. DOD \n     will have no need for bulk vessels.''\n       It was also concluded that ``subsidies are needed primarily \n     to offset the higher wages of U.S. mariners'' and that \n     ``subsidizing carriers simply to preserve jobs would leave \n     the Administration hard pressed to explain why it should not \n     also subsidize every other industry that suffers job \n     losses.''\n       We therefore request that before either H.R. 1350 or S. \n     1139 be considered by the Senate, that you hold a series of \n     full committee hearings to explore the work devoted to the \n     Rubin memo and the MIT study, and to hear the concerns and \n     suggestions from the growing number of critics of maritime \n     subsidies.\n           Sincerely,\n         Bob Dole, John Ashcroft, Don Nickles, Nancy Landon \n           Kassebaum, Hank Brown, Chuck Grassley, Jon Kyl, Rod \n           Grams, Jesse Helms.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                              Council for Citizens\n\n\n                                     Against Government Waste,\n\n                                                    March 7, 1996.\n     Hon. Larry Pressler,\n     Chairman, Senate Commerce Committee, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: The 600,000 members of the Council for \n     Citizens Against Government Waste (CCAGW) strongly oppose \n     H.R. 1350 and S. 1139, the Maritime Reform and Security Act \n     of 1995. These bills neither reform nor sustains security for \n     America's hard working taxpayers. This legislation is another \n     example of entrenched corporate political pork.\n       Because only maritime supporters were invited to attend the \n     single hearing held by the Subcommittee on Surface \n     Transportation and Merchant Marine, and critics of the \n     programs were barred from testifying, your full committee was \n     denied the benefit of independent analyses which would expose \n     the enormous waste involved in federal maritime programs. \n     There are far less costly and more effective means of \n     protecting America's national security interests.\n       Therefore, we urge that no Senate consideration of either \n     H.R. 1350 and S. 1139 be allowed until the full Senate \n     Commerce Committee holds open hearings that allow independent \n     experts and critics to testify.\n       This legislation actually undermines our national defense \n     because it:\n\n[[Page S11079]]\n\n       1. allows vessel operators to be exempt from \n     requisitioning;\n       2. permits operators to withhold their U.S.-flag vessels \n     from war duty by subcontracting far less costly foreign-flag \n     vessels, an still receive U.S.-flag vessels, and still \n     receive U.S.-flag premium rates;\n       3. provides the least militarily useful ships (i.e., large \n     non-self-sustaining container);\n       4. allows the transfer of U.S.-flag vessels to foreign \n     flags without approval, and,\n       5. reduces the capacity of the U.S. merchant marine fleet \n     by allowing operators to double-dip taxpayers through \n     multiple subsidies (direct--lump sum; indirect-cargo \n     preference premium rates and subsidized service in the \n     domestic trade and leasing subsidized ships without \n     restrictions to foreign citizens).\n       This legislation will discourage new investment and \n     innovation by erecting artificial, anti-competitive barriers \n     that give the upper hand to operators servicing domestic \n     trades in 1995, and barring subsidies to any newcomers even \n     if they are more efficient and can provide more militarily \n     useful vessels.\n       Your full committee should review the MARAD-sponsored MIT \n     report, ``Competitive Manning on U.S.-flag Vessels.'' This \n     report exposed wasteful maritime practices and found that \n     subsidies could be cut down to as little as $1.1 million per \n     vessel.\n       We also request that your committee study the work of 16 \n     executive branch agencies summarized in the ``Decision \n     Memorandum on Maritime Issues'' from Robert Rubin to \n     President Clinton. Fifteen agencies sided with the Defense \n     Department's conclusion that as few as 20 vessels--not the 50 \n     required by S. 1139--are needed for national security and \n     should be subsidized. And they concluded ``DOD will have no \n     need for bulk vessels,'' which means cargo preference \n     subsidies should be eliminated.\n       Just as telling is the fact that these agencies concluded \n     that ``subsidies are needed primarily to offset the higher \n     wages of U.S. mariners'' and that ``subsidizing carriers \n     simply to preserve jobs would leave the Administration hard \n     pressed to explain why it should not subsidize every other \n     industry that suffers job losses.''\n       Your committee should also hear from the Department of \n     Transportation's Inspector General, who concluded that the \n     entire Maritime Administration and all of its U.S.-flag \n     subsidies should be terminated, a conclusion similar to that \n     reached by Vice President Al Gore's National Performance \n     Review Transportation Task Force.\n       Strengthening our national defense is a goal CCAGW strongly \n     supports, but forcing taxpayers to subsidize high-priced \n     seafarers and militarily useless vessels during a time we are \n     eliminating the jobs of our men and women serving in the Navy \n     makes no sense at all. There is not one of these sealift \n     billets that our Navy personnel, with little or no training, \n     could handle.\n       S. 1139 and H.R. 1350 is corporate welfare that must be \n     stopped. We stand ready to assist you in these hearings and \n     in making the necessary changes to these bills.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 Thomas A. Schatz,\n     President.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n\n                                 Citizens for a Sound Economy,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, March 15, 1996.\n     Hon. Larry Pressler,\n     Chairman, Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation, \n         U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: On behalf of Citizens for a Sound \n     Economy's 250,000 members across America, I urge you to give \n     the opponents of H.R. 1350 and S. 1139, the Maritime Reform \n     and Security Act of 1995, a fair chance to voice their \n     concerns. To date, the Subcommittee on Surface Transportation \n     and Merchant Marine has only held one hearing on the Act, \n     failing to invite any of the many individuals and \n     organizations opposed to the bill. We believe that \n     consideration of the Act without the benefit of an open \n     debate will prevent the Senate from making an informed \n     decision in this important matter. Especially at a time when \n     Congress is attempting to come to grips with excessive \n     spending, pro-spending legislation should not be immune from \n     criticism.\n       Citizens for a Sound Economy strongly opposes the Maritime \n     Reform and Security Act of 1995. We believe that Congress \n     should put the era of costly Cold-War level maritime \n     subsidies behind it. The primary beneficiary would be current \n     and future generations of American taxpayers, who would not \n     have to pay the price of billions of dollars in new, unneeded \n     subsidies. We believe that America needs to rely on more \n     competitive, least-cost solutions to national security issues \n     and concerns. Among other needed reforms, this entails ending \n     spending on excessive salaries and benefits for U.S.-flag \n     seafarers and other unwarranted expenses associated with \n     often unwarranted vessels.\n       We would like to emphasize that a wide spectrum of policy \n     analysts and public officials seriously question and oppose \n     the continuation of the maritime subsidies and intervention \n     of all sorts. For one, Vice President Gore's National \n     Performance Review recommended that all maritime subsidies be \n     ended, saving Americans $23 billion over ten years. A study \n     by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, ``Competitive \n     Manning on U.S.-flag Vessels,'' pointed to the extensive \n     waste and abuse in the maritime programs and suggested ways \n     to get more value for less taxpayer dollars. This study was \n     commissioned by none other than the Maritime Administration. \n     The Defense Department notes that only 8 percent of the \n     supplies delivered to the Persian Gulf during the Gulf War \n     came on U.S. commercial vessels. The U.S. Transportation \n     Inspector General recently recommended that the Maritime \n     Administration and all maritime subsidy programs be \n     eliminated.\n       Harold E. Shear, former U.S. Navy Admiral and Maritime \n     Administrator, has concluded that ``Nearly 50 years of \n     subsidies have not prevented the demise of the U.S. merchant \n     marine . . . Subsidies do nothing more than cause \n     inefficiency, mediocrity, lack of incentive and dependence on \n     Uncle Sam.'' In 1993, 15 out of 16 government agencies sided \n     with now-Secretary of the Treasury Robert Rubin's option to \n     President Clinton to drastically revamp the Maritime \n     subsidies. The rationale for Mr. Rubin's option, as reported \n     to the President, was as follows:\n       ``Subsidies for the U.S. flag fleet have always been \n     justified by their role in providing a sealift capacity for \n     use in military emergencies. With the end of the Cold War, \n     DOD's sealift requirements have declined. Although DOD's \n     bottom-up review is not complete, the Secretary of Defense, \n     the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and the Commander \n     of the Transportation Command have already concluded that \n     future requirements will not exceed 20-30 liner vessels. DOD \n     will have no need for bulk vessels. All agencies therefore \n     oppose renewal of direct subsidies for bulkers. This option \n     would meet DOD's maximum military requirements. [S. 1139 \n     requires 50 vessels].''\n       The Wall Street Journal's Review and Outlook section noted \n     on June 6, 1995:\n       ``Rob Quartel, a former FMC [Federal Maritime Commission] \n     member, figures that all maritime subsidies together cost at \n     least $375,000 per seagoing worker. It would be a lot cheaper \n     to pay the sailors not to work. Eliminating these subsidies \n     would not only force the maritime industry to become \n     competitive, but also would contribute to the balanced budget \n     effort. Mr. Quartel figures, based on dynamic scoring, that \n     eliminating subsidies would save $7 billion between 1996 and \n     2002, and generate new economic activity that would raise an \n     extra $28 billion in tax revenue. Even in Washington terms, \n     $35 billion is real money.''\n       Mr. Chairman, the list of dissenting voices to this legacy \n     of subsidies from World War II and the Cold War goes on and \n     on. We ask that you carefully weigh the costs and the \n     benefits associated with the Maritime Reform and Security Act \n     of 1995, and all other maritime subsidies. The American \n     people deserve fair hearings on this issue where both points \n     of view are represented.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  Shane Schriefer,\n     Director of Government Relations.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n\n                                                Baltimore, MD,\n\n                                                     June 8, 1996.\n     Senator Charles E. Grassley,\n     Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Grassley, Thank you for your letter of May \n     30th asking me to check off certain items that I support on \n     an enclosed form.\n       You note that my signature is on a form submitted by the \n     American Security Council. I only signed that form to gain \n     time for mature study of a then pending bill which could have \n     resulted in subsidies for VLCCs! And now that I see how my \n     name is being used I much regret it.\n       I was invited to help that council formulate positions, and \n     I met with their representative. I enclose a copy of a letter \n     [please forgive bottom margins] that I sent to him that \n     indicates where I stand. My qualification to comment is shown \n     in my biology in Who's Who in America. I have not heard from \n     them since. But I am not surprised that my opinions do not \n     suit them.\n       So I prefer NOT to use your form. My views require a more \n     complex presentation--more than in the ``tip of the iceberg'' \n     letter enclosed.\n       I do believe that this country needs and should pay for \n     only that part of a U.S. merchant marine that is configured \n     in type and numbers to support our authenticated defense \n     requirements. I am opposed to the continuation of federal \n     programs. mostly designed to line the pockets of unions, \n     owners, and shipbuilders unwilling to give up grossly \n     inefficient practices. We desperately need a fresh start; not \n     a continuing jobs program.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 George P. Steele.\n                                           Vice Admiral (Retired).\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Also, in rebuttal to the Senator from Alaska on another \npoint he was making about foreign flags not doing the jobs, foreign \ncrews not doing the job, as a studied response to that, I want to have \nprinted in the Record a chart that tells a number of trips to the \nPersian Gulf. This shows that, in fact, only 17 U.S.-flag commercial \nvessels actually delivered goods in the war zone. This chart was \nprovided by the military sealift command. I did not put these figures \ntogether; I got them from the military sealift command.\n  Only five APL vessels--these are U.S. flags--went into the war zone; \nonly three sea-land U.S.-flag vessels went into the war zone; only four \nwatermen,\n\n[[Page S11080]]\n\nand their U.S.-flag vessels went into the war zone; only five Lykes \nU.S.-flag vessels went into the war zone; total--total, only 17 U.S.-\nflag vessels delivered goods into the war zone. That is 17 compared to \n500 trips into the war zone, so that means overwhelmingly--I hope you \nunderstand, overwhelmingly--17 trips versus 500 trips, U.S. The \nremaining were foreign flag, foreign crew.\n  I am sure the Senator from Alaska did not mean his remarks to be in \nsupport of my amendment to make sure American-flag ships deliver all \nthe way. But his statement that he was making is a statement in support \nof that amendment. I am sure it was not intended to be that way, but he \ngives a rational argument for that amendment, a strong statement for \nthat amendment.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have this printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n          U.S. CARRIER OWNED/CONTROLLED VESSELS USED FOR SMESA          \n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                    Number of           \n                                                     vessels            \n                                Total    U.S.-flag   actually  U.S.-flag\n                               vessels   component    going    component\n                                 used                into the           \n                                                       gulf             \n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nAPL.........................         30         23         12          5\nFarrell.....................          4          4          0          0\nLykes.......................         12         12          5          5\nSea-Land....................         36         19         13          3\nWaterman....................          4          4          4          4\n                             -------------------------------------------\n      Total.................         86         62         34         17\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. This chart makes it crystal clear the overwhelming \nnumber of these ships were foreign flag and foreign crew. Out of the \ndefense control we only had one instance where the material did not get \nthere--only one instance.\n  I think the statement by the Senator from Alaska was questioning the \nreliability of foreign-owned flag ships and foreign crews, but they \ndelivered. Only one did not deliver. U.S.-flag components, total, 17. \nThe rest out of the 500 that made it into the zone were foreign.\n  I have heard my colleague state U.S. flags charged less than foreign \nflags during the Persian Gulf war.\n  I want to provide my colleagues with what the Department of the Navy \nreported to me on the cost of charter vessels:\n\n       The cost of foreign voyage chartered ships is approximately \n     60 percent of U.S.-flag voyage charters.\n\n  The Navy said:\n\n       Only 41 of 283 vessels were U.S. flag.\n\n  My amendment does not prohibit transfers of smaller feeder vessels to \ndeliver war materiel in the war zone. My amendment simply says that \nthese smaller feeders must be U.S. flag and U.S. crewed, not foreign \nflag. This is what we are led to believe this bill is all about. We are \nled to believe that if this bill passes, only U.S. flags and crews will \ndeliver our goods into the war zone. Without my amendment, this will \nnot be guaranteed. My amendment says U.S. flag and U.S. crews will \ndeliver our goods into the war zone. This is what Senator Lott--and I \nquoted him twice--said 2 months ago that we need to assure.\n  I think it is appropriate at this point to repeat a section of a \nletter that I got from Vice Adm. George P. Steele, U.S. Navy, retired. \nHe was one of those who had his name on the original National Security \nCouncil memo in support of this legislation. Then when I sent him a lot \nof material to study, he sent me back a very nice letter.\n  The last paragraph reads:\n\n       I do believe that this country needs and should pay for \n     only that part of a U.S. merchant marine that is configured \n     in type and numbers to support our authenticated defense \n     requirements. I am opposed to the continuation of Federal \n     programs mostly designed to line the pockets of unions, \n     owners, and shipbuilders unwilling to give up grossly \n     inefficient practices. We desperately need a fresh start; not \n     a continuing jobs program.\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to submit for the Record two \npages detailing the cost of cargo preference as

Mr. President, I want to take this opportunity to, No. \n1, congratulate the House of Representatives for their strong, \nbipartisan support for the override of the President's veto on the \nissue of partial-birth abortions.\n  The House did speak strongly yesterday and did speak in a bipartisan \nfashion. I had the opportunity to look at some of the debate and hear \nsome of the debate. I was impressed with the strong bipartisanship. I \nwas impressed with how articulate Members were on debating an issue \nwhich is a very emotional issue, a very difficult issue to talk about. \nThis is not a procedure that many people feel very comfortable \ndiscussing. I think the Members who got up and spoke on behalf of the \noverride spoke factually, compassionately, restrained, and, as a \nresult, I think that kind of debate is what I hope to emulate here. I \nhope we see it emulated here on the floor of the U.S. Senate next week. \nWe will have a vote here next week in the U.S. Senate on whether to \noverride the President's veto. We are only halfway home to accomplish \nthat.\n  Much has been written today about the likelihood of whether the \nSenate will do so and reporting that it appears that the possibility of \noverriding the President's veto of this is dim here in the Senate. I \nremind everyone that in the House, when the original vote was taken, \nthere were not sufficient votes to override the President's veto. But \nas a result of educational efforts that had taken place by physicians \nand people who are concerned about this issue with Members of the \nHouse, a number of Members were persuaded to go along with the \noverride.\n  I hope that occurs here. I hope Members who voted against the bill to \noutlaw this procedure, who voted to allow this procedure to continue, \ndo take the opportunity to gather more information, because since the \noriginal passage of this bill, additional information has come out, \neven as late as this week.\n  We have a story in the Bergen County Record. A health reporter for \nthe Bergen County Record did a report on partial-birth abortions in New \nJersey, where, according to all of the abortion rights advocates, there \naren't partial-birth abortions being done in New Jersey.\n  In fact, they were only done, according to them, by a couple of \ndoctors which totaled about 500 a year. We find out from the health \nreporter of the Bergen County Record in her interviews with \nabortionists in New Jersey that they perform roughly 3,000 second- and \nthird-trimester abortions, and approximately half of those 3,000 \nabortions are done in what is called ``intact D''--which is a \npartial-birth abortion.\n  So we know that just in the State of New Jersey there are 1,500 such \nabortions--just done in the State of New Jersey. And we are talking \nabout abortions that are performed at at least 20 weeks.\n  My wife is a neonatal intensive care nurse. She worked as one for 9 \nyears. We have three children. We are very blessed to have one more on \nthe way. She knows a lot about premature babies. She has cared for a \nlot. She has cared for 22-week-old babies. She has cared for 22-week-\nold babies that are alive and well today--many of them. She has cared \nfor a lot of 24-weekers that are alive and well today. And she \ncertainly has cared for a lot of babies that are 24 weeks, 29 weeks, \nand 34 weeks who are alive and well, and very normal and very healthy.\n  The question is not whether we should have late- and second-term, or \nthird-term abortions. I believe that is a legitimate question to ask in \nthis country. But that is not the question that is before us with this \noverride. This override deals with a medical procedure which I think is \none of the most gruesome medical procedures that if it was being done \nin China today human rights activists would be calling on us to \nsanction China. If it was done on a dog, animal rights activists would \nbe storming the Capitol saying it is inhumane. But if it is done on a \n30-week-old baby that is fully viable outside the womb it is a choice; \nit is not a baby; it is a choice. It is up to the doctor and the mother \nto determine what happens to that baby. It is a choice; it is not a \nbaby.\n  I do not think that is what most of America is. When we talk about \nthis procedure being done on late second- and third-trimester babies, a \nprocedure that delivers the entire baby feet first--delivers the baby \nfrom the shoulders down completely outside the mother; the arms and \nlegs of the baby are moving outside of the mother; the head is held \ninside the birth canal--a pair of scissors is taken and jammed into the \nbase of the skull, a suction catheter is placed in the skull and the \nbrains are sucked out. As a result of that the head collapses, and then \nthey deliver the rest of the baby.\n  I was on the Fox Morning News yesterday morning with a woman who \nworks for an abortion rights advocacy group. And I asked her a \nquestion, which I will ask every Member of the Senate who speaks on \nthis issue. I hope they have an answer for me, because she didn't. My \nquestion was very simple. It was a very logical question. ``What would \nyour position be if the head of that baby had somehow slipped out; had \nsomehow when the shoulders were delivered had been delivered also? \nWould it be the woman's choice and the doctor's choice when the baby is \ncompletely removed to kill that baby? Is that then murder? Or, if you \nhold the baby's head inside the birth canal, it is not murder? Explain \nfor me the difference. Answer the question.''\n  I know that question has been asked a lot in the last few months. \nAnd, to my knowledge, no one has answered the question. But I think you \nhave to answer that question, don't you? Don't you have to answer a \nquestion that, if just an inch more, maybe 2 inches more, it is murder? \nMost Americans would consider it as murder without question. But as \nlong as that doctor is holding the baby in, it is not murder. We are \nblurring the line in this country a lot. It is more than blurring. It \nis more of a sign of a culture that has lost its way, that does not \nunderstand what its underpinnings are any more; what its vision is; \nwhat its purpose is; what it stands for; who it cares about.\n\n  This issue is not about abortion. This is about a procedure that is \nso horrendous and that is so disgusting that everyone in America should \nsay, ``No. That is not who we are.'' For we in this country are not \nwhat we say we are. It is not what we would like to tell the American \npublic we are. We are in this country what we do. And when we do \nsomething like this to children who doctors who perform this procedure \nsay are healthy, elective abortions--these are elective abortions; \nthere is no medical necessity; there is no fetal abnormality but simply \nhealthy children--when the vast majority of these abortions are done at \nthat time and in this way we have to say no.\n  I am hopeful, I am prayerful that the Members of the U.S. Senate, the \ngreatest deliberative body in the history of the world, will live up to \nthat, live up to that title, and will truly deliberate--not react to \nthe special interests, or to the emotion of the moment, or to some \npolitical posture that you feel locked into because, you know, ``I am \nfor choice''--but deliberately, thoughtfully, prayerfully about who we \nare, about what we stand for as a country. I think if we do that--and \nif all of you who care about who we are, about what is to become of us, \nwill write and call and pray for Members of the Senate over this next \nweek--then truly remarkable things can still happen in this country and \nin this body, and we will surprise a lot of people next week.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Gregg). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n[[Page S11082]]\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I want to make a few remarks concerning \nthe Senator from Iowa's comments and his three amendment. First, I \noppose his VISA program amendment. The amendment would require Maritime \nSecurity Fleet Program [MSFP] contractors to participate in Voluntary \nIntermodal Sealift Agreements [VISA]. This change is unnecessary. The \nbill already requires MSFP participants to enter into Emergency \nPreparedness Agreements [EPA]. EPA is the same as the VISA program, \nwith several improvements suggested and supported by the Defense \nDepartment. The Senator's amendment would limit the Department of \nDefense's ability to access all of a contractor's assets. This would \nhandcuff DOD's ability to tailor commercial sealift assets to meet \nDOD's sealift needs. The DOD helped write this bill. The bill provides \nthe flexibility DOD wants. Further, it would impose additional \nrestrictions that are not found in the bill or even in the existing \nVISA program that is voluntary today. This amendment simply does not \nmake sense--it would impose additional costs on moving government \ngoods. It would cost taxpayers more, not less. I hope my colleagues \nwill join me in opposing this amendment.\n  Second, I oppose his lobbying and campaign contribution amendment. \nThe amendment would prohibit the use of funds provided to Maritime \nSecurity Fleet Program [MSFP] contractors from being used to fund \nlobbying or public education efforts or campaign contributions. This \namendment is unnecessary and unfairly singles out one industry with \nwhich the Government enters contracts.\n  Current Government contracting and Federal election campaign laws \nprohibit the use of Government funds for these purposes. The Byrd \namendment, 31 U.S.C. 1352, generally prohibits recipients of Federal \ncontracts, grants, loans, and cooperative agreements from using \nappropriated funds for lobbying the executive or legislative branches \nof the Federal Government in connection with a specific contract, \ngrant, loan, or cooperative agreement. There is absolutely no legal \nbasis for restricting the lawful activities of the employees of the \nrecipients, as suggested by the Senator from Iowa. A logical extension \nof this suggestion would be to restrict the lawful activities of the \ncontractor's fuel supplier or ice cream vendor. Any attempt to change \ncurrent lobbying and campaign contribution restrictions should be \nbroader in scope so as to treat all such recipients of Federal funds in \na similar and fair manner. I intend to move to table this amendment.\n  Finally, Mr. President, as I said earlier, I am opposed to the \nSenator from Iowa's amendment on rates. All of these amendments are \ndesigned to kill the bill. They are killer amendments. I intend to move \nto table the Senator's amendment on rates. The managers of the bill \nwill also move to table the second degree amendment to that amendment \nthat has been proposed by the other Senator from Iowa. The second \ndegree amendment is just as objectionable as the underlying one.\n  Mr. INOUYE. There is no further business?\n  Mr. STEVENS. Have we had an adjournment order yet?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair has not been informed of that.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I suggest the absence of a quorum. I will take care of \nthat.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Gorton). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/20/senate-section/article/S11081-1", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "20", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11082]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. COVERDELL.

Mr. President, we understand on our side that we are \ndrawing near the most intense period of the 1996 elections, but we feel \nvery strongly that we should set the politics aside for the election \nprocess, and here on the floor of the Senate and in the Halls of \nCongress create a safety net from politics for our soldiers in Iraq and \nin Bosnia or wherever they may be, for our disaster victims that have \njust suffered the ravages of the hurricane coming out of the Caribbean \nin the Atlantic and tearing its way through North Carolina and other \nregions of our country, and, obviously, for our children and our \nseniors.\n  In other words, Mr. President, this is a time to put the people \nfirst, the people's business first, to not raise anxiety among the \nNation but go ahead and get our business done, get the politics out of \nthese Halls, out of the city, and let those questions be settled by the \nAmerican people in the actual election process. Once again, we should \ncreate a safety net from the political era for our soldiers in Iraq, \nour disaster victims in the United States, our children, and our \nseniors.\n  Mr. President, in that regard, I commend the leaders on our side, the \nSpeaker of the House, Speaker Gingrich, and the Senate majority leader, \nTrent Lott of Mississippi. Yesterday, they came before the American \npeople, having met with the Republican leadership of the Appropriations \nCommittee, and released the following statement:\n\n       We have already made substantial progress on appropriations \n     bills for the 1997 fiscal year, with action completed or \n     virtually completed on nine separate bills. We are committed \n     to reaching an agreement with the administration on the \n     remaining bills and completing congressional action by \n     September 27th.\n       It is clear that Senate Democrats are using delaying \n     tactics and political stunts designed more for the upcoming \n     election than for the completion of the people's business. We \n     have approached the consideration of these bills in good \n     faith, but we have been met at every turn by gridlock, \n     apparently coordinated by the White House. We refuse to be a \n     part of this game. We believe Congress should complete its \n     business and adjourn.\n       Given the Democrats' strategy to tie up the Senate floor, \n     House and Senate leaders have decided that the Defense \n     appropriations conference report will be the vehicle for \n     final consideration of all uncompleted appropriation issues. \n     The remaining issues will be resolved through bipartisan \n     negotiations between congressional leaders and the White \n     House.\n       In addition to reaching agreement with the administration \n     on shared priorities like education and antiterrorism, we \n     are determined to ensure that we quickly provide critical \n     funding for our troops, for coping with recent disasters, \n     and for those who are fighting the critical war on drugs.\n       While we are committed to reaching an agreement with the \n     administration, we are concerned that we have not yet \n     received complete information on their requests for \n     additional spending. We look forward to active negotiations \n     over the next days leading to final legislation that will \n     complete the work of the Congress and stay within the limits \n     of this year's budget.\n\n  Again, it is our goal to put a safety net under our troops, our \ndisaster victims, our children, our seniors, and all the families that \nrepresents across our land.\n  Mr. President, on the other side, White House Chief of Staff Leon \nPanetta has admitted that some Democrats would like to force \nRepublicans to stay in Washington longer. That sounds like it is \ndesigned strictly for political purposes. Now the other side uses a \nslogan, ``Putting Families First,'' but if the White House allows these \nDemocrats to force extended legislative days here and confusion and \nchaos, moving you to a point you would have Government gridlock, they \nare engaged in politics at the ultimate.\n  Mr. President, I am reminded that last year was a very difficult \nperiod here between the Congress and the President. The President likes \nto blame the fact that Government came to a close on the Republican \nCongress. He tends to forget, Mr. President, that he vetoed \nappropriations bill after appropriations bill. At least, Mr. President, \nat that time, we were fighting over an absolute core issue in America, \nwhether or not to balance the budget, something that virtually 80 \npercent of the American people are wanting and demanding--very \nsubstantive.\n  Of late, Mr. President, we have heard--and I will read from an \neditorial in the Washington Times--that shutdown may have had more to \ndo with politics than substance, too. Everybody\n\n[[Page S11083]]\n\nis aware of the trials and tribulations of Dick Morris, former \nconfidant of the President of the United States, but this woman that \napparently shared a relationship with him, Sherry Rowlands, said, ``He \nasked if I would like some cognac, and we talked about how it tasted \nand then we talked about the Government shutdown, and that he said he \nplanned this for 5 months ahead of time to show the President as a \nleader with no weakness.''\n\n  So now we have suggestions that that tumultuous period in the \nCongress may have, indeed, been nothing more than a political plan to \nincrease one's fortunes in the political polls. Well, that may or may \nnot be the case. We will be, sometime, adjudicating that. But we \ncertainly know, Mr. President, that at this point the interests of the \nAmerican people are that we conclude this fundamental decision, that we \ndon't create new anxiety in the country, that we come to terms and \nsettle our differences, that we protect our troops, that we protect our \ndisaster victims, our children, our seniors, and all the families \nassociated with that. Let the political stuff get settled out across \nthe land in the elections. Don't put the people last. Put them first. \nLet's get this business done and do it in such a way that the American \npeople can be comforted, and that all these systems upon which they \ndepend will continue without interruption.\n  Mr. President, we have been joined by my good colleague, the \ndistinguished Senator from Tennessee. I yield up to 5 or 10 minutes, as \nhe may need, to comment on this issue.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee is recognized.\n\n\n                         Legislative Priorities\n\n  Mr. THOMPSON. I thank my good friend from Georgia, who expresses some \nvery valid concerns, and I share those concerns.\n  Mr. President, as we approach the end of this session of Congress, I \nthink it is imperative that we get our priorities in order.\n  The elections are only 6 weeks away. As we all know, this is a highly \ncharged time. There is much at stake. And right now, there are some \nvague rumblings out there that my colleagues on the other side of the \naisle may wish to use this tension to partisan advantage.\n  Mr. President, I submit that the leadership has gone the extra mile \ntoward accommodating the concerns of the party in the minority. This \nconsideration of interests is as it should be.\n  But I also want to make it clear that if this session stretches out, \nit will largely be for political reasons--and caused by the minority in \nthe Senate.\n  It appears entirely possible that some of my colleagues are prepared \nto stall the final legislation we are now considering in order to play \nraw politics.\n  First off, I believe that the Members of this body should be above \nthat sort of thing. The American people are cynical enough about the \ncharacter of the Congress without its Members handing them more \nammunition. We need to raise the level of discourse here.\n  Second, we should keep in mind that we are not talking about trivial \nmatters. We are here to conduct the people's business. To hold up the \nwork of the Senate for partisan advantage is outrageous. And I will \ntell you something else, the folks back home will see through it. The \npeople who elected us know pious posturing when they see it.\n  If there is a stall to keep us in session, the people are going to \nfigure out who's doing it, and pretty fast.\n  It is one thing to work through honest differences of opinion. It is \nquite another to offer trifling, divisive amendments and stalling \ntactics at the end of an election-year session to wring out every last \npolitical advantage.\n  I call on my colleagues on the other side of the aisle to put this \nsort of maneuvering aside, so that we can finish the business that the \npeople elected us to conduct.\n  To prevent playing politics with the lives of Americans, and to \nprevent even the charge that anyone might be playing politics, we must \nmake certain that the President has legislation on his desk that \nfinishes out the business we need to close in this term.\n  There are several basic issues we must address before we adjourn. I \nam certain that when we keep in mind how important it is to conduct the \npeople's business with the dignity it commands, that we will find it in \nourselves to work our way through these pending matters to a swift and \nproper outcome.\n  Right now, we have troops in Bosnia and the Middle East. These men \nand women are out there on our behalf, and they deserve our unyielding \nsupport. Let us make sure they have whatever they need, and let's do \nthat immediately.\n  At home, even as we vigorously debate the Federal role in domestic \naffairs, we need to uphold the commitment we now have to maintain those \nservices we have promised--and to do so at the levels to which we are \ncommitted. This is of vital importance, most especially to our \nveterans, students, senior citizens, and their families.\n  As Senators, we are obliged to set the highest moral example, and in \nthat, we must keep our word to the people who elected us.\n  While we may disagree on the very best way to implement solutions to \nthe problems we face, I trust that we do not disagree that some action \nis vital to keeping our country strong, and to enabling the Nation to \nconduct business. We have a basic obligation to the people who elected \nus, to maintain the services of the Federal Government at a high level \nof efficiency and responsiveness.\n  We can do this if we put our minds to it. All that is required is \nthat we decide to finish the people's business, and work toward \nagreement on the outstanding issues we face.\n  This Congress has achieved a great deal. We should be proud. We've \npassed many reforms which will not only save money for the taxpayers, \nbut that also will make Government more efficient and more positive in \nthe lives of Americans.\n  We have passed the line-item veto. We have passed the Congressional \nAccountability Act. We have ended unfunded mandates. And these are just \na few of the achievements we have to show for our efforts when we agree \nto get the job done.\n  Let us end this session of Congress on a high note by doing what we \nwere elected to do. Let us work out our differences and pass \nlegislation along to the President that will keep this country open for \nbusiness.\n  I hope that as we move through these legislative decisions, that we \nkeep in mind that we cannot jeopardize the important elements of our \nGovernment that enable this Nation to be strong, safe, and free.\n  We want to preserve the safety of our troops. We want to preserve the \nability of the Nation to conduct its business, and to maintain the \nservices that our children, our families, and our seniors have come to \ndepend on. Let us not play politics with these matters.\n  Traditionally, the Members of this body have come together for the \nbest interests of the Nation. This Congress has been up to that task, \nand I am certain that it still is. My colleagues on both sides of the \naisle are strong enough in their resolve, and they care enough about \nthe way we conduct our lives in America, that we can all come together \nto find agreement on the Nation's business.\n  Let us concentrate on where we agree, not where we differ.\n  Let us focus on the issues that bring us together, not those that \ntake us apart.\n  Let us find a way to work together, and get this job done.\n  I trust that we can find a common path as we have in the past, and in \ncooperation with the White House, to reach a consensus without delay.\n  But make no mistake, the majority has done its part. If we are \ndetained in Washington to keep Congress in session, it will not be over \ndifferences in ideas or for honest disagreements. We have met our \ncolleagues more than halfway. It's time to wrap things up, and we ought \nto be doing that right now.\n  The people's business should be above partisan posturing, and I \nsincerely hope that we can maintain a level of effort and dignity--\ncommensurate with the history of the Senate--so that we can complete \nour work on a high note as we finish out the 104th Congress.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I appreciate very much the Senator from \nTennessee making himself available for a very cogent statement on this \nsubject. I know he is trying to get home. I appreciate his taking time \nto visit\n\n[[Page S11084]]\n\nwith us about this very important matter of getting the people's \nbusiness done, getting a safety net here so we can lower the \nanxiousness of what gridlock will produce in our country at this time.\n  As I said a little earlier, we are now speculating about whether the \nlast gridlock that occurred in the country was an actual political \nplan. I am made uncomfortable when the White House Chief of Staff \nadmits that some Democrats would like to force Republicans to stay in \nWashington longer. This article, which appears in the National Journal \nCongressional Daily, says:\n\n       Some Democrats, Thursday, warned that finishing the funding \n     bills may not be as easy as Republican members are saying. \n     Senate minority leader Daschle warned there may be pitfalls \n     in trying to pass the bill.\n\n  Well, what we are hearing is that you are laying a political strategy \nbecause it is thought to be politically useful to have the Congress \nappear to be tied up in knots. But I would like to step back from that \nand just remind my colleagues on the other side of the aisle that, \ncurrently, because of decisions that the President of the United States \nhas made, there are 15,000 American soldiers, men and women, in Bosnia. \nThere are 1,500 of them in Croatia.\n  There are 29,500 American armed services men and women in the gulf. \nThere are 200,000 U.S. troops on duty abroad. There are 54,000 involved \nin 13 operations around the globe while 146,000 are stationed at \npermanent bases abroad. We have literally--quick math--over 50,000 in \nharm's way today. And the prospect of this kind of posturing is \ncompletely out of place. It leaves everyone of the families here at \nhome in support of these troops wondering, and it increases their \nworry.\n  I remember in 1990 my good friend and colleague, former President \nBush, confronted with a Congress that was exacting and demanding tax \nincreases, and priorities that were not his but he had 1.5 million of \nAmerica's men and women in the gulf, and simply would not accept \nallowing our Government to come to a gridlock. He would not accept it. \nIt may have been the decision that ultimately lead to his failed \nelection. But he was not going to leave those American men and women \noverseas at risk. He was not going to do it. So he accepted the \nCongress--that was controlled by the other side of the aisle--he \naccepted it, and he paid an enormous price for it because people \nthought that he had reneged on a pledge. But he first and foremost \nstood behind those men and women in uniform in harm's way. We do not \nhave as many, fortunately, in harm's way today. But we have 50,000. I \nthink it is just as incumbent upon this Congress and this President to \nget that safety net under these men and women, and remove the anxiety \nand get the politics out of here. Get it done. Let them feel secure and \nmove on.\n  I could read a long litany as we move from troops. We often hear the \nFamilies First agenda about children as if they were the only \nlegislators that were concerned about children. I would like to remind \nthem that in the legislation that we are calling upon to get settled we \nhave 20,000 families in crisis who would not know where to turn for \nhelp for temporary child care, for crisis nurses that serve thousands \nof families with children who have disabilities, or serious illnesses. \nAnd the families that are under stress--including families affected by \nHIV, homelessness, violence, and family crisis in drugs and alcohol--\nover 20,000 families were served in the last 2 years alone. For these \nfamilies are we going to put them first, as they are asking, or last, \nto fulfill a political objective?\n  Will you shut down 2,000 school districts who benefit from impact \naid, or put in question the financing of all of those systems? Impact \naid provides financial assistance to school districts for the cost of \neducating children when enrollments and the availability of revenues \nfrom local sources have been adversely affected by the presence of \nFederal activity. That means military impact by and large across our \ncountry.\n  Mr. President, the list goes on. You could cite the issues and \nproblems that will be compounded ad infinitum as you go through this \nhuge appropriations process that we are saying we should just announce \nto the entire country is going to be settled; lower the stress; our \ntroops don't have to worry; the systems are going to stay intact and we \nare going to take politics out of the Halls of Congress, and we are \ngoing to put them in the election where they properly belong.\n  Mr. President, I have been quoting this National Journal rather \nextensively. It is interesting reading. I notice that my good friend, \nthe Senator from Connecticut, Senator Dodd, who is chairman of the \nDemocratic National Committee, suggested that our party wants to go \nhome because they realize--we realize--that this Congress, the 104th \nCongress, is a ``disaster.'' I just could not leave that unchallenged. \nI remind my good friend from Connecticut that in the last Congress, the \n103d Congress, it was dominated by two massive events:\n\n  First, the passage by one vote in the House and the Senate, at their \nencouragement and by the President's demand, of the largest tax \nincrease in American history;\n  Second, by the suggestion that we should grow Government to the \nlargest level it had ever been, and that we should put in place for \nAmerica a Government-run health system, which would have meant for the \nfirst time that over 50 percent of the U.S. economy would be run by the \nGovernment and not by our private sector and citizens.\n  Those are the two most singular marking events of the last Congress.\n  Now we come to this Congress that the Senator from Connecticut \ncharacterizes as a ``disaster.'' We have had no tax increase. We have \nhad not expanded the Government. As a matter of fact, we have saved the \nAmerican taxpayers in this Congress $53 billion in the last 2 years, \nmarking the first time in 25 years that Congress has reversed the trend \nto increase discretionary spending; in other words, the first time we \nhave responded to the American people's request that we get spending \nunder control.\n  We adopted a tax--an adoption tax credit. We secured tax relief for \nsmall business. We passed the line-item veto after a 200-year debate. \nWe made Congress--you and I--live under the same laws as the rest of \nAmerica. We passed legislation that would stop unfunded Federal \nmandates. We passed, after years of debate, welfare reform. We passed \ntax deductions for long-term care expenses. We passed targeted health \ncare reform, lobbying reform, food safety, safe drinking water and \nEverglades restoration.\n  And the list really is much longer.\n  More importantly, we secured at least an interim transition in our \nPresident, Mr. President, because in his State of the Union he said \nthat the era of big Government is over. I would call that a rather \nsubstantive success.\n  The agenda in this city has been changed. The era of big Government \nis over. Welfare reform is in place. Health care reform is in place. We \nare not raising taxes. We are saving taxpayers billions upon billions \nof dollars.\n  Mr. President, I think this is exactly the kind of change that \nAmerica has been asking for.\n  I am going to conclude, Mr. President, by simply saying that I think \nit is incumbent upon all of us--both sides of the aisle, given the \nnature of this political season, and the intensity of it, to come to \nterms--to get a safety net under our troops, our families that are \nvictims of disaster, our children, and our seniors. Take the elections \nand our differences out of these halls and into the elections \nthemselves.\n  With that, I yield back any time remaining under my designation.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/20/senate-section/article/S11082-2", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "20", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11084-S11087]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           THE CLINTON RECORD\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I would like to share a few moments \nwith my colleagues on actions taken by the Clinton administration this \nweek. We have had discussions concerning the appropriateness of the \nPresident withdrawing about 1.8 million acres in Utah under the \nauthority of the Antiquities Act of 1906.\n  I ask the Chair and my colleagues, is this really the creation of a \nnational\n\n[[Page S11085]]\n\nmonument, or is it simply a reelection ploy? The administration \njustifies the action based on some historical withdrawals of Federal \nland, referring back to Teddy Roosevelt's time. I would ask for a quick \nreflection on the oversight of the various land management agencies and \nlaws as they have been developed over the years--the Bureau of Land \nManagement, the National Park Service, the management of our refuge \nsystems--and suggest that there is, indeed, enough oversight in the \nprocess to ensure extremes are not taken on the utilization of public \nland.\n  I think a number of people are asking, in the wake of President \nClinton's surprise announcement Wednesday of the 1.8-million-acre \nnational monument withdrawal in southern Utah, just what the President \nand the administration have in mind. One looked at some of the media \nand saw the expanse of the Grand Canyon with the President standing--I \nshould say sitting--at a desk overlooking the brink of the Grand Canyon \nwith the Vice President standing behind him.\n  This withdrawal was a last-minute withdrawal, it was a secretive \nwithdrawal, it was an unconventional withdrawal. The way they attempted \nto create the Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monument, could cause \none to quickly conclude the administration was primarily concerned \nabout the photo opportunities and climbing the staircase to reelection. \nThe details of this withdrawal were left undecided. The potential harms \nof this hasty decision, in my opinion, suggest the President is in an \nirresponsible rush to get on the evening news.\n  I have a question for the White House and the President. It is \nspecific. It is: Why was the public not involved in this decision? We \nhave NEPA, FLPMA, and Federal land use planning laws, all of which \nstress public involvement in species protection. The administration \ninsists on strict adherence to these laws. Adherence to these laws \noccurs, of course, before the action, not after it.\n  These laws were followed in the California desert wilderness debate. \nIt was extensive. We all participated in it. It did not turn out the \nway we all wanted it, but a democratic process occurred, hearings were \nheld, there was give and take, the State of California was consulted, \nindividuals in this body took a stand, they voted on it and they were \nheld accountable for their vote. Why was that procedure not followed in \nthe State of Utah?\n  My constituency, of course, is the State of Alaska. We have already \nexperienced a little activity in the 1970's, under President Carter, \nwith the Antiquities Act, whereby some 56 million acres or thereabouts \nwere withdrawn.\n  Wilderness in Alaska is very sacred to us. The mistake that was made \nin our State, when we were establishing land patterns, is we did not do \na resource inventory. We almost did. We could have met the wilderness \ndemands and we could have identified those areas of high resource \npotential, but, unfortunately, the technology and the commitment were \nnot quite there at that time. So we are in constant conflict with \nFederal refuge areas and the potential development and access through \nthese areas. So we do have a long memory with regard to the application \nof the Antiquities Act and other laws.\n  But, in this case, the President, in this day--not in 1970 or 1975 or \n1978, but in 1996--did not run the idea by the State of Utah, its \nelected officials, its legislature, its Governor. He did it over the \nobjection of the Utah delegation. They could have helped prevent some \npitfalls that are going to occur.\n\n  Instead, they read about it in the newspapers. You can also assume \nthe administration simply has written off Utah, their electoral votes--\nsix, I think--written them off. They have probably written off Alaska.\n  I know my colleague from Idaho is introducing legislation to ensure, \nas far as Idaho is concerned, the application of the Antiquities Act. \nWyoming, after the experience with the Antiquities Act, had a provision \nin the final settlement that suggested that the Antiquities Act would \nbe no longer applicable in that State. In our State of Alaska, we have \na no more clause. The Federal Government simply cannot take land under \na land grab and designate it without a congressional process occurring.\n  The President included 200,000 acres of school trust lands in Utah \nwhich potentially could produce $1.5 billion to fund Utah's public \nschools. Why did the President not choose to work with Governor Leavitt \nabout that and the other $6.6 billion the State potentially would lose? \nDoes the President realize that locking up 62 billion tons of \nrecoverable low-sulfur coal will lead to greater air pollution when \nutilities are forced to burn dirtier coal?\n  Like it or not, coal provides about half the Nation's electricity.\n  It is my understanding this particular coal deposit would be about 40 \nacres out of the 1.8 million acres--a pretty small footprint.\n  Does the President know that 350,000 acres of what he is declaring a \nmonument will be opened up to buses, tourists, and other development, \nand that it would have been protected as wilderness under the plan \nwritten by the State of Utah and Utahns? In fact, Utah had indicated a \nwillingness for further review of its roadless areas for wilderness \nstatus.\n  What about the huge liability the Federal Government assumes in \nwiping out private property claims in this area? Where are we going to \nfind the money to reimburse Americans whose property is, obviously, \ntaken at the cost of billions of dollars? What about the people who are \ngoing to lose their jobs? The President says the monument will add \njobs.\n  Let's look at Utah. The people of Kanab, UT, an area surrounded by \nfive national parks, had their families' incomes drop from $23,000 in \n1990 to $18,000 in 1995. That does not sound like a lot of new jobs to \nme.\n  These questions bring a bigger question to mind: Why was our \nPresident in such a hurry? We went through this process. We were going \nto take it up again in the 105th Congress. He was pressed by the Utah \ndelegation not to make the designation until such questions were \nanswered. The administration and the President offered vague promises \nsaying details would be worked out later. Even Utah's Democratic \nCongressmen begged him not to ignore the details. I have even heard \nthat Dick Morris made the recommendation. Maybe he is still calling the \nshots for the President and the administration.\n  So let me be blunt. Our President appears to be a young man in a \nhurry. It is becoming more and more clear he doesn't seem to be very \nconcerned about where he is going, as long as it leads to his \nreelection. As a result, we have great TV news stories, a lot of action \nand some major policy blunders, in my opinion. We seem to be seeing the \ninfluence from the extreme national environmental groups who have the \near of the administration and the President, and these groups have put \nfear into the American people; fear that we cannot develop resources on \npublic lands. This issue is true not just about coal mining. It is true \nabout grazing, it is true about timbering, it is true about oil and gas \nexploration--virtually all development on public land.\n  The environmental community is instilling this degree of fear in the \nAmerican electorate. It bears no responsibility, no accountability. \nThey simply sell American technology short and, by this fear tactic and \nthe ability of the media to expound on it and add to it, they are \ngenerating membership, they are generating dollars, and we are becoming \nmore and more dependent on imports, something I am going to talk a \nlittle bit about later.\n  As we reduce our own self-sustaining resource base, we become more \ndependent on imports. Those imports are coming in from nations that do \nnot have the same environmental sensitivity that we do. We have the \ningenuity, we have the technology, we have the American know-how to \npreserve these jobs at home, develop our resources, and do it safely.\n  The President's designation of the 1.7-million-acre monument was an \narrogant act. It was in violation of the intent of the Federal \nenvironmental laws and procedures the President's own administration \nhas so ardently enforce on everyone else.\n  Mr. President, I intend, before this session is over, to introduce \nlegislation to close this dangerous loophole in our environmental laws. \nIt is going to be applicable, obviously, to those States with public \nlands, which are the Western States, to eliminate the necessity and the \nauthority of the President to\n\n[[Page S11086]]\n\ncontinue these land grabs without any congressional evaluation.\n  The Antiquities Act of 1906 has a narrow, specific purpose. It was \nnever intended to be used in this manner. As I indicated, Alaska and \nWyoming have been exempt from the act, but other public land States \nshould know it could only be a matter of time before they are attacked \nfor withdrawals similar to what occurred in Utah.\n\n  The question is not should we have a national monument in Utah. The \nUtah delegation said it would work with the administration on that. The \nquestion is, should a President ram through such a big Federal land \nchange at the last minute without public participation and \ncongressional involvement?\n  Clearly, we know the answer. The democratic process is being \ncircumvented. It is no wonder some people are referring to this action \nas President Clinton's Federal land grab and calling it reelection \nnational monument. He says he is merely doing what Teddy Roosevelt did \nby using the Antiquities Act of 1906. But, again, there are many \nimportant differences. President Roosevelt thought first and acted \nlater. Roosevelt acted nearly 100 years ago, before this Nation \ndeveloped environmental laws and procedures for proper and detailed \nland use decisionmaking. I am sorry, President Clinton, you are no \nTeddy Roosevelt.\n  (Mr. HATFIELD assumed the Chair.)\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, in conjunction with that, I think it is \nnoteworthy to recognize President Clinton's themes this week. He \ncontinues to push the themes that, one, he is the environmental \nPresident, and, two, he is the export President. Let's examine that for \na minute. I just shared with you my views on why his decision to lock \nup Utah's vast energy resources was a mistake, but I also want to \ndiscuss why his rhetoric about exports covers up what is really going \non with the trade deficit.\n  The most recent statistics on the trade deficit were absolutely \nhorrible. In July, imports increased to $78.9 billion from $77.9 \nbillion in June. The largest increases were in industrial supplies and \nmaterials, primarily the cost of crude petroleum.\n  Our exports decreased to $67.2 billion from $69.7 billion in June. \nThe trade deficit in goods for the first 6 months of this year amounted \nto $89.6 billion, and this is expected to grow to $170 billion by \nyear's end, second only to last year's record $175 billion.\n  China and Japan continue as the countries with the largest trade \nimbalance, but focusing only on China and Japan ignores one of the \nmajor contributors to our trade deficit, and that is our dependence on \nforeign oil. Right now, America is importing 51 percent of its daily \noil needs. That percentage is expected to rise to two-thirds by the \nyear 2000.\n  Here is a chart, Mr. President, of the current account balances of \nour top three creditors from 1994 to 1995. Petroleum payments in 1994, \n27 percent, or $44.2 billion; petroleum payments in 1995, 33.2 percent, \nor $57.9 billion. Then there is China, Japan, and others.\n  That is what we are looking at when we look at the trade deficit. As \nthis chart illustrates, foreign oil dependency translates into one-\nthird of the total trade deficit. The Department of Energy predicts \nthat by the years 2000 and 2002, we will be two-thirds dependent on \nimported oil. Instead of 51 percent, it will be 66 percent.\n  What is America doing about its continuing dependency? I think we are \nfollowing counterproductive policies. We are not reducing our oil \ndependency. As I said earlier, the President just locked up huge \nreserves of coal in Utah. This is clean coal. Earlier, he vetoed \nlegislation which would have opened up the Arctic oil reserve. That \npassed both the House and the Senate for the first time. That is the \nbest chance to find significant stable American sources of oil \ndomestically, in the United States.\n  I remind my colleagues that Prudhoe Bay has been supplying this \nNation with nearly 25 percent of its total crude oil utilization for \nthe last 18 years. It is in decline. Yet this administration will not \nlet us use American technology to go into the areas that are most \nlikely to have a major discovery. And with that technology, the \nfootprint would be very small, no larger than the Dulles International \nAirport complex, which is about 12,500 acres out of the 19 million \nacres in the area associated with the Arctic National Wildlife Reserve.\n  So the President's actions are certainly disturbing. But I guess they \nare hardly surprising, because if you really look at our energy area--\nand as chairman of the Energy and Natural Resources Committee, that is \nmy area of responsibility--he is equally unwilling to address and \npromote nuclear power, coal power, hydroelectric power. He strongly \nsupports the consumption of natural gas, but is not equally supportive \nof domestic production. He does not want to see additional offshore and \nonshore Federal lands opened up. In short, he is doing virtually \nnothing to reduce our dependence on imported oil and, thereby, address \nour trade deficit.\n  During President Clinton's 4 years in office, the United States will \nhave accumulated the largest trade deficit in the history of our \nNation. That is astonishing, when you consider the exchange rate \nrecords set during the same period. I think this is a part of the \nClinton record that Americans should understand and consider and \nreflect on a little closer.\n  There is another inconsistency relative to energy. As we recognize \nour dependence on nuclear power for about 30 percent of our power-\ngenerating capability, we have accumulated high-level nuclear waste. \nThe President refuses to support the plan in Congress to establish in \nNevada a temporary repository until a permanent repository can be \ndetermined at Yucca Mountain.\n  As far as low-level waste, the President refuses to support a \ncongressional proposal giving the ability to the State of California at \nWard Valley to put in a facility to store the waste even though we have \ngiven the States the authority. The disturbing thing is, while the \nPresident, in this election mode, opposes these proposals--responsible \nproposals, proposals that have been supported by State Governors, State \nlegislatures, and proposals that have been supported by a majority of \nthe U.S. Senate--he and his administration refuse to come up with \nresponsible alternatives.\n  I have sent letters saying, if you do not like this, what will you \nsupport? He absolutely ignores the responsibility associated with \naddressing and correcting these exposures.\n  Lastly, Mr. President, another part of the Clinton record that should \nnot go without remark is the inept and naive approach the \nadministration has taken in dealing with some of our foreign \nadversaries. Let me just touch on two recent examples.\n  The Clinton administration, some time ago, embarked on a policy \ntowards North Korea that can only be called, in my opinion, \n``appeasement,'' and put the United States in a position of being a \nparty, almost, to a bribe. Under the so-called negotiated framework \ndeal, the Clinton administration was going to provide North Korea with \n$500 million worth of oil--500,000 tons a year--and, along with South \nKorea and Japan, two light-water nuclear reactors worth $4 to $5 \nbillion.\n  What have we received in return for this so-called deal? Have the \nNorth Koreans acted in good faith? No. The North Koreans held us \nhostage. They said they would stop their own graphite reactor \nconstruction if they could have this new technology, and only then \ncould we go in and examine their storage sites, once the new light-\nwater reactors were on line.\n  Under the deal we negotiated, the Clinton administration was going to \nprovide these light-water reactors worth $4 to $5 billion. We saw what \nNorth Korea did with regard to acting in good faith just yesterday and \nthe day before in their relationships with South Korea and the rest of \nthe world.\n  A North Korean submarine, filled with 26 commandos--I met with the \nKorean Ambassador last evening--tried to infiltrate the south. Some of \nthe commandos carried South Korean uniforms with them. They were armed. \nAnd they had a mission, Mr. President, a mission to infiltrate South \nKorea. But we will hear more about that later.\n\n  Nineteen of the commandos have already been killed. A manhunt \ncontinues for the remaining infiltrators. But these commandos came from \na North Korean submarine that beached in the south. The United Nations \ncommand attempted to deliver a formal protest to the North Korean \nmilitary official in the face of clear evidence of the North Korean \ninfiltration. The North\n\n[[Page S11087]]\n\nKorean Government refused to even accept the protest of South Korea.\n  So there we have, I think, an extraordinary example of our foreign \npolicy, perhaps well-meaning, but indeed to a high degree naive in \nrelation to shoring up a deteriorating regime of totalitarianism in \nNorth Korea, one that, if left to its own weight, in the opinion of the \nSenator from Alaska, would very soon flounder. There is no other area \nin the world as isolated as North Korea. Having visited there a few \nyears ago, I can tell you that they cannot feed themselves as a nation. \nThey have no energy. They have no capital reserves. They have an \nextraordinary government whose longevity is extremely short, in this \nSenator's opinion.\n  So, Mr. President, what has the Clinton administration done? Well, \nhave they decided to reconsider the energy bribery deal they have \nnegotiated with the north? No. No. They are not reconsidering it. Are \nthey so naive they believe the North Korean Government bargains in good \nfaith? I wonder. The American people have to wonder when it comes down \nto this administration and President Clinton negotiating with foreign \nadversaries.\n  What of the Clinton administration's spin-doctoring claim of \n``success'' after last week's cruise missile attack in Iraq? The \ncoalition that President George Bush put together in 1990 is crumbling. \nSaddam Hussein has no fear of crushing the Kurds because he knows that \nU.S. leadership is lacking under this President and this \nadministration.\n  Just this week we learned that nearly 200 people disappeared. They \nhave been murdered, Mr. President. These are people who were providing \nour Government with intelligence. Why didn't we get those people out of \nthe country before Saddam and his murderous troops crushed the Kurds?\n  Yesterday, CIA chief John Deutch told Congress that Saddam is \npolitically stronger today than he was before he sent his troops into \nnorthern Iraq. Somebody asked the question, well, is Saddam better off \ntoday than he was 2 weeks ago? The answer is clearly, yes. We have lost \na good deal of credibility.\n  So, Mr. President, it is a very dangerous world we live in. It is \neasy to criticize. But it is important to point out the gross \ninconsistencies associated with these items that I have touched on \ntoday.\n  I think the administration is naive. I think they are gullible. I do \nnot think they are equipped, based on their record, to deal with the \ndangers that confront us today and in the immediate future. Mr. \nPresident, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Murkowski).

Mr. President, in the last days of this session, as I \nreflect on the past 30 years in which I have been priviliged to serve \nhere in the U.S. Senate, my thoughts turn time and again to the many, \nmany individuals who not only have enriched my experience here but have \nbeen exemplars of public service. I cannot possibly name them all or \nthank them all. There are two gentlemen, however, who have been \nintegral to the work of the Appropriations Committee in my time as \nchairman and ranking minority member these past 15 years, and I want to \ntake a few minutes today to thank them, particularly, today.\n  Bill Hoagland has served as the staff director of the Senate Budget \nCommittee for 11 years. In that time, he has grappled with Gramm-\nRudman-Hollings, played a significant role in the 1987, 1990, and 1995 \n``budget summit'' negotiations, and fought daily battles with virtually \nevery committee in the Senate and the House of Representatives to \nnurture an effective congressional budget process and keep the fiscal \npolicy of our Government on a sound foundation. The legislative process \nduring his tenure in the Senate has been nearly consumed with budget \nlegislation of one sort or another, and he has been in the midst of it \nall.\n  Bill Hoagland has epitomized the qualities and character of an \noutstanding public servant and Senate staffer. He has been unfailingly \nhonest. He has considered opposing views of issues dispassionately. He \nhas been a staunch defender of the budget process, and a loyal advisor \nto his chairman, Senator Pete Domenici. Like his chairman, he has been \ncourageous in holding his convictions despite harsh criticism from \ncertain quarters. The Senate is fortunate to have his able assistance, \nand I salute him.\n  A sound relationship with the Office of Management and Budget is very \nimportant to the work of the Appropriations Committee, and in the past \n10 years that relationship has been enhanced by the work of Chuck \nKieffer, a career employee of OMB. Chuck started at OMB when Mr. David \nStockman was named Director, and he has served under every Director \nsince, through Republican and Democratic administrations alike. He has \nbeen the principal OMB liaison with the House and Senate Appropriations \nCommittees under Republican and Democratic majorities.\n  By virtue of that experience, Chuck Kieffer has become the single \nperson in OMB most knowledgeable about the appropriations process. He \nis the institutional memory of the Executive Office of the President on \nwhat we have done, and what we have left undone, in appropriations \nacts. More important, he is the honest broker between the Congress and \nthe administration, faithfully characterizing the differences between \nus, and providing accurate information to bridge those differences. He \nworks impossibly long hours keeping track of myriad issues, and does so \nwith a degree of professionalism that meets the highest standard. For \nthat, he has earned the respect and appreciation of the committee \nmembers and staff in both Houses on both sides of the aisle, and I want \nthank him for his service.\n  Mr. President, there are many other people throughout our Government, \nat all levels, who perform demanding jobs under difficult \ncircumstances. They do so with integrity and diligence to duty. Those \nof us who serve here, in the House of Representatives, and in the \nhighest levels of the executive departments, could not do without them. \nAll of the citizens of this Nation owe them more than we ever \neffectively express. By expressing my appreciation to Bill Hoagland and \nChuck Kieffer, I mean to convey that appreciation to all those other \npublic servants as well, who perform day after day these many duties \nstaffing our committees and our personal offices.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Hatfield pertaining to the introduction of S. \n2100 are located in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced \nBills and Joint Resolutions.'')\n  Mr. HATFIELD. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, in 1794 George Washington said, ``I know\n\n[[Page S11088]]\n\nof no other pursuit in which more real and important services can be \nrendered to any country than improving its agriculture.'' These words \nmean as much today, over 200 years later, as they did then. \nAgricultural industries employ nearly 20 percent of all Americans.\n  Today, I rise to honor a dear friend for 26 years of dedicated \nservice to Missouri agriculture. On September 24, 1996, Lowell Mohler \nwill gather with friends, family, and colleagues to celebrate the \nachievements of his distinguished career with the Missouri Farm Bureau. \nLowell is a native Missourian born in Oregon, MO. Agriculture was \nalways in his blood. Upon receiving his agriculture degree from the \nUniversity of Missouri, he pursued an active career in agriculture, \nincluding assistant director of marketing for the Kansas State Board of \nAgriculture, marketing director of the Missouri Department of \nAgriculture and a vital member of the Missouri Farm Bureau.\n  Lowell began his career with the Missouri Farm Bureau in 1970 and \ncurrently serves as the chief administrative officer and corporate \nsecretary. For many years, Lowell has been a driving force meeting \nMissouri farmers' needs. Over these years, Lowell has been honored by \nhis peers many times over. In April 1988, Gamma Sigma Delta, a national \nhonor society recognizing individuals for scholarship and service in \nagriculture, honored him with the Distinguished Service to Agriculture \nAward for his outstanding support of the University of Missouri's \nCollege of Agriculture. In September 1990, Lowell was again honored \nwith the Missouri University Alumni Association Distinguished Service \nAward for his continuing support and efforts in adding to the \nexcellence of the university. In January 1991, he received the Missouri \nUniversity Citation of Merit Award and the Presidential Citation Award \nfor Extension. In October 1991, he received the State Friend of \nExtension Award in recognition of outstanding public service and \nsupport of the Missouri Cooperative Extension Service and its \neducational programs. In 1995, he was honored with the Ag Leader of the \nYear Award presented by the Missouri Ag Industries Council. Lowell's \nattributes are many as his honors describe.\n  Lowell was there during the devastating Missouri flood of 1993, \nhelping farmer after farmer cope with their great losses due to rising \nfloodwaters. His own farm, which borders the great Missouri River, also \nfell victim with huge crop losses due to the floodwaters. But Missouri \nfarmers persevered and overcame with the help of Lowell and the \nMissouri Farm Bureau.\n  Lowell's generosity, integrity and foresight have continued over the \nyears to keep Missouri agricultural interests strong for Missouri \nfamilies and farmers. American farmers set the world agricultural \nstandards by producing the highest quality products at the lowest \nprices. Missouri's 28 million acres of farmland and production of beef \nrank second in the Nation. Missouri is also among the top 15 States \nproducing rice, soybeans, milo, hay, corn, and cotton. Agriculture is a \ncritical force in Missouri's economy as well as the Nation's.\n  On a personal note, my friendship with Lowell has afforded me the \nopportunity of his wisdom. Lowell was always happy to advise me \nregarding my farm in Missouri. He unselfishly assisted me in planning \nand complying with conservation regulations, particularly in the area \nof soil and water conservation, tree preservation and replanting, \npasture rotation, and general farm management. During my tenure as \nGovernor, Lowell served on the transition team in 1985 to 1986; he was \nalso appointed to the business and education partnership commission, \nwhich was a task force to study the higher education system in \nMissouri. Lowell provided me countless hours of advice on agricultural \npolicy important to Missouri farmers and ranchers, which was a result \nof policy established by the grassroots development process of the \nMissouri Farm Bureau. His whole family was involved, too. Lowell's \nwife, JoAnn, served as my executive secretary from 1985 to 1993 during \nmy tenure as Governor of Missouri. Lowell and JoAnn continue to be \nclose friends, whom I respect for advice and guidance.\n  For these important reasons, I rise today to recognize and salute my \nfriend for not only the 26 years of exemplary service to the Missouri \nFarm Bureau, but for his lifelong dedication to the Missouri \nagricultural industry. Lowell Mohler's service and friendship has been \nan inspiring testimony to me as well as all Missourians.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/20/senate-section/article/S11087-4", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "20", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11088]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO DONNELL HORN\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I rise today to honor one of Nevada's most \ndedicated activists, Pastor Donnell Horn. For 25 years, Pastor Horn has \ntirelessly ministered to others, working to better the lives of \neveryone he touches.\n  Serving as Pastor of New Revelation Baptist Church in Las Vegas for \nthe past 16 years, Pastor Horn has not only earned the love and respect \nof his parishioners, but of the entire community to which he has \ndevoted himself. Striving to uplift and empower the people he assists, \nPastor Horn brings new hope to those struggling in hard times. He is a \ncounselor and a minister who reaches out to heal his community. As he \nworks to help those whose need is immediate, Pastor Horn also has a \nvision for the future and is always thinking of the next generation. \nHis leadership and humanity have indeed made Las Vegas a better place, \nand, because of his work, our children's future looks brighter.\n  It is my pleasure to speak today in tribute to Donnell Horn, and \ncongratulate him on his 25 years of service in the ministry. For the \nexcellence and compassion with which he has performed his job, Nevada \nowes Donnell Horn a debt of gratitude.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/20/senate-section/article/S11088-1", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "20", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11088]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Williams, one of his secretaries.\n\n\n                      executive messages referred\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting one \nnomination which was referred to the Committee on Finance.\n  (The nomination received today is printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/20/senate-section/article/S11088-2", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "20", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11088-S11089]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n     REPORT CONCERNING THE CUBAN LIBERTY AND DEMOCRATIC SOLIDARITY \n       (LIBERTAD) ACT OF 1966--MESSAGE FROM THE PRESIDENT--PM 171\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER laid before the Senate the following message \nfrom the President of the United States, together with an accompanying \nreport; which was referred to the Committee on Foreign Relations.\n\nTo the Congress of the United States:\n  This report is submitted pursuant to 1705(e)(6) of the Cuban \nDemocracy Act of 1992, 22 U.S.C. 6004(e)(6) (the ``CDA''), as amended \nby section 102(g) of the Cuban Liberty and Democratic Solidarity \n(LIBERTAD) Act of 1996, Public Law 104-114; 110 Stat. 793 (the \n``LIBERTAD Act''), which requires that I report to the Congress on a \nsemiannual basis detailing payments made to Cuba by any United States \nperson as a result of the provision of telecommunications services \nauthorized by this subsection.\n  The CDA, which provides that telecommunications services are \npermitted between the United States and Cuba, specifically authorizes \nme to provide for payments to Cuba by license.

Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce the Women's \nBusiness Training Centers Act of 1996, a companion to H.R. 4071 \nintroduced by Congresswoman Nancy Johnson on September 12.\n  As many of us recognize, women-owned businesses are one of the \nfastest growing, highly stable, and job-producing segments of our U.S. \neconomy. At the same time, I am afraid they are also one of the most \nperceptually under-valued segments of our business sector; there are \nfar too many who have overlooked this extraordinary group of business \nowners.\n  Let me cite some phenomenal statistics about women-owned businesses.\n  Between 1982 and 1987, women-owned firms increased by 57.5 percent, \nmore than twice the rate of all U.S. businesses during that period. In \n1987 they numbered approximately 4.1 million. By 1996, women-owned \nbusinesses had grown to approximately 8 million businesses and employed \n18.5 million people, which is one out of every four U.S. company \nworkers and more than the Fortune 500 companies employed worldwide. \nThey generated an estimated $2.3 trillion in sales and are in every \nindustrial sector.\n  The National Association of Women Business Owners [NAWBO] reports \nthat the growth of women-owned firms continues to outpace overall \nbusiness growth by nearly two to one, and that their top growth \nindustries are construction, wholesale trade, transportation/\ncommunications, agribusiness, and manufacturing. Women entrepreneurs \nare taking their firms into the global marketplace at the same rate as \nall U.S. business owners. Women-owned businesses have sustaining power \nwith 40 percent remaining in business for 12 years or more. As \nspectacular, women own 30 percent of all businesses and are projected \nto own 50 percent of all businesses by the year 2000.\n  These statistics are truly impressive. They also emphasize that \nwomen-owned businesses have achieved these monumental feats because of \nbusiness acumen, as well as self-reliance, ingenuity, common sense, and \ndogged determination. I say this because there still remain enormous \nobstacles for women who want to establish businesses; in particular, \naccess to capitol and technical assistance.\n  One of the most beneficial programs designed to assist women business \nowners is the Women's Business Training Centers in the Small Business \nAdministration [SBA] to provide training, counseling, and technical \nassistance. I know personally how very beneficial this demonstration \nprogram has been in my State of New Mexico. I have talked with the \nwomen clients and toured their businesses, and thanks to the able \nleadership of the centers' personnel, these businesses are growing \nfinancially, employing new personnel, and creating new markets for \ntheir goods and services.\n  The Women's Business Training Centers Program is one of the most \nneeded, best utilized, and tangibly successful activities I have seen. \nIt is also one of the smallest programs in the SBA; the Administration \nrequested only $2 million this year, although I am hopeful Congress \nwill see fit to fully fund it at twice this amount. In my estimation, \nthis program should be expanded so that the SBA can establish the \nbusiness centers in all of the States, particularly those 22 States \nthat currently have no sites.\n  The program is slated to end in 1997. I believe this would be a real \ndisservice to America's women business owners. Therefore, this bill \nwill permanently authorize the program, increase the centers' funding \ncycle from 3 to 5 years, and increase its presently authorized funding \nlevel from $4 to $8 million.\n  I believe the time has come for Congress to recognize how absolutely \nessential women entrepreneurs are to the American economy. As I stated \npreviously, women business owners have achieved enormous successes \nbecause of their independent spirit and skills. We can, however, offer \nsome valuable assistance for a very minimal amount of funding. I \nbelieve it fair to say that the return on that investment will far \nexceed just about any other we may make.\n  As the National Association of Women Business Owner's fact sheet \npoints out, ``the greatest challenge of business ownership for women is \nbeing taken seriously.'' The statistics and proven record of women \nbusiness owners speaks for itself, and I invite my colleagues to \nsupport this effort in their behalf.\n  This bill, which is going to continue to expand upon the concept of \nhaving women business training centers, should become law. I am not \nsure that will happen this year. But based upon the kind of things \nhappening and the needs out there and the fairness of this approach, I \nbelieve it will become law. I am pleased to introduce it at this point.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2098\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

The Administration may \n     disburse up to 25 percent of each year's Federal share \n     awarded to a recipient organization after notice of the award \n     has been issued and before the non-Federal sector matching \n     funds are obtained.\n       ``(4) If any recipient of assistance fails to obtain the \n     required non-Federal contribution during any project, it \n     shall not be eligible thereafter for advance disbursements \n     pursuant to paragraph (3) during the remainder of that \n     project, or for any other project for which it is or may be \n     funded. In addition, prior to approving assistance to such \n     organization for any other projects, the Administration \n     shall specifically determine whether the Administration \n     believes that the recipient will be able to obtain the \n     requisite non-Federal funding and enter a written finding \n     setting forth the reasons for making such determination.\n       ``(c) Each applicant organization initially shall submit a \n     five-year plan on proposed fundraising and training \n     activities, and a recipient organization may receive \n     financial assistance under this program for a maximum of five \n     years per site.

A bill to amend title XIX of the Social Security Act to \nprovide post-eligibility treatment of certain payments received under a \nDepartment of Veterans Affairs pension or compensation program, and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n                     Veterans Benefits Legislation\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, on behalf of myself and Senator Graham, \nI am introducing today legislation which, when enacted, will modify the \ntreatment of certain veterans benefits received by veterans who reside \nin State veterans homes and whose care and treatment is paid for by the \nMedicaid Program.\n  Veterans residing in State veterans homes, who are eligible for aid \nand attendance [AA] and unusual medical expense [UME] benefits, \nveterans benefits provided under Title 38 of the United States Code, \nwho are also eligible for Medicaid, are the only veterans in nursing \nhomes who receive, and who are able to keep, the entire AA and UME \nbenefit amounts. This can be as much as $1,000 per month.\n  Other veterans, who reside in other types of nursing homes are \nreceiving Medicaid, and who are also eligible for AA/UME can receive \nonly $90 per month from the VA.\n  Yet other veterans, who reside in State veterans homes but who are \nnot eligible for the AA/UME benefits must contribute all but $90 of \ntheir income to the cost of their care.\n  So, even though veterans residing in State veterans homes who are \neligible for AA and UME benefits and who qualify for Medicaid have all \nof their treatment and living expenses paid by the State Medicaid \nProgram, they nevertheless may keep as much as $1,000 per month of the \nAA and UME benefits.\n  It might be useful for me to review how this state of affairs came to \nbe.\n  In 1990, legislation was enacted (PL 101-508, November 5, 1990) which \nmodified title 38, the veterans benefits title of the United States \nCode, to stipulate that veterans with no dependents, on title XIX, \nresiding in nursing homes, and eligible for aid and attendance and \nunusual medical expenses, could receive only a $90 per month personal \nexpense allowance from the VA, rather than the full UME and AA amounts.\n  State veterans homes were subsequently exempted from the definition \nof nursing homes which had been contained in those earlier provisions \nof PL 101-508 by legislation enacted in 1991--PL 102-40, May 7, 1991.\n  The result was that veterans on title XIX and residing in State \nveterans homes continued to receive UME and AA. Until recently, the \nState veterans homes followed a policy of requiring that all but $90 \nper month of these allowances be used to defray the cost of care in the \nhome.\n  Then, a series of Federal Court decisions held that neither UME nor \nAA could be considered income. The court decisions appeared to focus on \nthe definition of income used in pre- and post-eligibility income \ndeterminations for Medicaid. The court decisions essentially held that \nUME and AA payments to veterans did not constitute income for the \npurposes of post-eligibility income determinations. The reasoning was \nthat, since these monies typically were used by veterans to defray the \ncost of certain services they were receiving, the payments constituted \na ``wash'' for purposes of income gain by the veterans.\n  However, the frame of reference for the courts' decisions was not a \nnursing home environment in which a veteran receiving Medicaid benefits \nmight find himself or herself. In other words, the UME and AA payment \nreceived by a veteran on Medicaid are provided to a veteran for \nservices for which the State is already paying through the Medicaid \nprogram. The veteran is not paying for these services with their own \nincome. So, as a consequence of the court decisions, these payments to \nthe veteran in State Veterans Homes represent a net gain in income to \nthe veteran; they are not paid out by the veteran to defray the cost of \nservices the veteran is receiving.\n  As I mentioned earlier, VA does not pay AA or UME to veterans who are \nalso on title XIX and residing in non-State Veterans Home nursing \nhomes. Those veterans get only a $90 per month personal allowance.\n  And non-Medicaid eligible veterans who reside in State Veterans Homes\n\n[[Page S11092]]\n\nmust pay for services with their own funds. If they get UME and AA \npayments, the State Veterans Home will take all but $90 of those sums \nto help defray the cost of the nursing home care.\n  Although the written record does not document this, I believe that \nthe purpose for exempting State Veterans Homes was to allow the Homes \nto continue to collect all but $90 of the UME and AA paid to the \neligible veteran so as to enable State Veterans Homes to provide \nservice to more veterans than they otherwise would be able to provide.\n  In any case, it seems highly unlikely that the purpose of exempting \nState Veterans Homes would have been to allow these veterans, and only \nthese among similarly situated veterans, to retain the entire UME and \nA amounts.\n  The legislation I am introducing today modifies Section 1902 (r)(1) \nof the Social Security Act to stipulate that, for purposes of the post-\neligibility treatment of income of individuals who are \ninstitutionalized--and on Title 19--the payments received under a \nDepartment of Veterans Affairs pension or compensation program, \nincluding Aid and Attendance and Unusual Medical Expense payments, may \nbe taken into account.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. HATCH:\n  S. 2100. A bill to provide for the extension of certain authority for \nthe Marshal of the Supreme Court and the Supreme Court Police; read the \nfirst time.\n\n\n               Marshall of the Supreme Court Legislation\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce legislation that \nis needed before the end of this legislative session. This simple bill \nwould extend the authority of the Marshal of the Supreme Court and the \nSupreme Court Police to provide security to Justices, Court employees, \nand official visitors beyond the Court's buildings and grounds. The \nbill is straightforward and should not be controversial.\n  The authority for the Marshal of the Supreme Court and the Supreme \nCourt Police to provide security beyond Court grounds appears at 40 \nU.S.C. 13n(a)(2), and was first established by Congress in 1982. \nCongress has periodically extended that authority, which is now slated \nto expire on December 29, 1996. See 40 U.S.C. 13n(c).\n  In the past 14 years, there has not been an interruption of the \nSupreme Court Police's authority to provide such protection. Congress \noriginally provided that the authority would terminate in December \n1985, and extensions have been provided ever since. In 1985, authority \nwas extended through December 26, 1986; in 1986, it was extended \nthrough December 29, 1990; in 1990, it was extended through December \n29, 1993; and in 1993, it was extended through December 29, 1996.\n  Chief Justice Rehnquist has written to me requesting that Congress \nextend this authority permanently. The Chief Justice correctly pointed \nout to me in his letter, ``As security concerns have not diminished, it \nis essential that the off-grounds authority of the Supreme Court Police \nbe continued without interruption.'' The Supreme Court informs me that \nthreats of violence against the Justices and the Court have increased \nsince 1982, as has violence in the Washington metropolitan area. \nAccordingly, I support a permanent extension of this authority to \nprovide for the safety of the Justices, court employees, and official \nvisitors.\n  Given the late date in the Congress, however, and the fact that we \nmust pass an extension before December 29, 1996, I am introducing \nlegislation that would provide for a 4-year extension, until December \n29, 2000. I encourage Congress at some point to extend the authority on \na permanent basis, but I am suggesting a 4-year extension so that we \ncan get this done on short order.\n  I note for my colleagues that this provision is without significant \ncost, but provides great benefits to those on the highest court in the \nland and those working with them. According to the Supreme Court, from \n1993 through 1995, there were only 25 requests for Supreme Court Police \nprotection beyond the Washington, DC metropolitan area, at a total cost \nof $2,997. I am also informed that off-grounds protection of the \nJustices within the DC area is provided without substantial additional \ncost, since it is part of the officers' regularly scheduled duties \nalong with tasks on Court grounds.\n  I encourage my colleagues to support this much-needed extension so \nthat we can pass this bill before we adjourn.\n      By Mr. HATFIELD:\n  S. 2102. A bill to nullify the Supplemental Treaty Between the United \nStates of America and the Confederated Tribes and Bands of Indians of \nMiddle Oregon, concluded on November 15, 1865; read twice and ordered \nplaced on the calendar.\n\n\n                    TREATY NULLIFICATION LEGISLATION\n\n  Mr. HATFIELD. Now, Mr. President, this is probably the last act of \nlegislation that I will perform in my long tenure in the Senate. I want \nto offer today, and I am very hopeful that even though this is in the \nclosing hours that this will rise above any other kind of \nconsiderations because it offers an opportunity for all of us to \ncorrect a historic wrong. One hundred and forty-one years ago, at the \nrequest of the U.S. Government, the Tribes of Middle Oregon gathered \nnear The Dalles on the Columbia River to negotiate and sign a treaty \nthat would forever change the lives of their people. On June 25, 1855, \nafter many days of extended discussions and negotiations with Joel \nPalmer, Superintendent of Indian Affairs for the Oregon Territory, the \ntreaty between the Tribes of Middle Oregon and the United States was \nsigned. It was ratified by the U.S. Senate March 8, 1859 and has served \nsince that time as the primary agreement between the Warm Springs \nTribes and the U.S. Government.\n\n  The 1855 treaty established a reservation--referred to as the Warm \nSprings Reservation--some 50 miles to the south of the Columbia River, \non the Deschutes River. The 1855 treaty also provided that the members \nof the signatory tribes settle on the newly created reservation and \ncede the balance of their territory to the United States. In signing \nthe 1855 treaty, the tribes insisted upon retaining their right to \nhunt, fish, graze, and gather roots and berries at their usual and \naccustomed stations and on unclaimed lands outside the reservation. \nThese reserved treaty rights were essential for the Tribes' life and \nculture.\n  While the tribes settled on the reservation soon after the treaty \nsigning, they maintained their accustomed practice of traveling \nregularly to the Columbia River to harvest its magnificent runs of \nsalmon. The continued presence of Indian people fishing along the \nColumbia, however, irritated the non-Indian settlers and prompted the \nthen-Superintendent of Indian Affairs for Oregon, J.W. Perit \nHuntington, to pursue efforts to keep the Tribes away from the \nsettlers.\n  To that end, Superintendent Huntington drew up a supplemental treaty \nand, on November 15, 1865, convinced the tribes of the Warm Springs \nReservation to sign it. This treaty, called the Treaty with the Middle \nOregon Tribes of November 15, 1865, was ratified by the U.S. Senate on \nMarch 2, 1867. According to its terms, the treaty prohibits the Indians \nfrom leaving the Warm Springs Reservation without the written \npermission of the Government and relinquishes all of the off-\nreservation rights so carefully negotiated by the tribes as part of the \n1855 treaty.\n  The Indians of the Warm Springs Reservation have never complied with \nthe 1865 treaty and the United States has never tried to enforce it. \nThe historical record explains why this is so. The 1865 treaty was \nobtained by fraud--plain and simple. The Indians, who did not speak, \nread, or write English, were told by the Government agent that the \ntreaty only required them to notify the Government agent when they left \nthe reservation to fish on the Columbia. They were never told that the \ntreaty abrogated their cherished right to fish at Celilo Falls and \nother traditional places outside the reservation. How do we know this? \nHistorical documents. Historical documents, including subsequent U.S. \nJustice Department affidavits taken from Warm Springs Indians present \nat both the 1855 and 1865 treaty signings, show that the Indian \nsignatories understood the agreement as providing a pass system \nidentifying Indians leaving the reservation to exercise off-reservation \nrights. They understood this pass system as a means of distinguishing \nthe friendly treaty tribes\n\n[[Page S11093]]\n\nfrom the hostile Indians who were raiding in the area. It was never \nunderstood or explained that the treaty relinquished all off-\nreservation rights, or that Indians could not leave the reservation \nwithout the Superintendent's written consent.\n  According to the affidavits, Huntington secured the signatures of \nmembers of the tribes during a stay on the reservation that lasted less \nthan 24 hours. It is difficult to conceive that the tribes, in less \nthan 1 day, would agree to imprison themselves on their reservation and \nrelinquish the off-reservation rights that they exhaustively negotiated \nin 1855, cutting themselves off from their principle source of food. As \nthe affidavit of Albert Kuck-up states:\n\n       I am sure that the Indians would have positively refused to \n     sign any paper, for Huntington or anyone else, that would \n     have taken from them their fishing rights or fishery. Fish is \n     to us what bread is to the white man.\n\n  Affidavits and other historic documents show that Huntington then \ndeparted for Klamath, OR, never to return. He even took with him the \ntwo wagons and teams he had promised to leave with the Indians of the \nWarm Springs Reservation.\n  Almost immediately following the signing of the 1865 treaty, the \nIndians from the Warm Springs Reservation continued to travel to the \nColumbia River to fish from their historic fishing sites. Warm Springs \nAgency agent John Smith wrote in his June 26, 1867, report to \nSuperintendent Huntington that ``as early as the 16th of May, 1866, the \nIndians began to visit the salmon fisheries in large numbers.'' Reports \nby Agent Smith in subsequent years further document continued fishing \non a substantial scale, and in a July 1, 1869, letter from Agent Smith \nto Superintendent A.B. Meacham--who replaced Huntington on May 15, \n1869--Smith noted ``the Indians said they did not understand the terms \nof the [1865] treaty'', that ``they claim that it was not properly \ninterpreted to them'', and that ``they were led to believe the right of \ntaking fish, hunting game, etc., would still be given them because \nsalmon was such an essential part of their subsistence.'' That same \nyear, in a September 18, 1869 report regarding the Warm Springs \nReservation to Superintendent Meacham, U.S. Army Captain W.M. Mitchell \nwrote,\n\n       I also have to report, for the consideration of the proper \n     authorities, that the Indians unanimously disclaim any \n     knowledge whatever of having sold their right to the fishery \n     at The Dalles of the Columbia, as stated in the amended \n     treaty of 1865, and express a desire to have a small \n     delegation of their head men visit their Great White Father \n     in Washington, and to him present their cause of complaint.\n\n  Official U.S. Government reports in subsequent years continue to note \nthe Warm Springs Reservation Indian's strong objection to the 1865 \ntreaty, their continued and uninterrupted reliance on their fisheries \non the Columbia River, and the fraudulent nature of the 1865 treaty \nsigning. In the annual report, dated August 15, 1884, Warm Springs \nAgent Alonzo Gesner finds:\n\n     on record what purports to be a supplementary treaty . . . \n     which is beyond a doubt a forgery on the part of the \n     Government in so far as it relates to the Indians ever \n     relinquishing their right to the fisheries on the Columbia \n     River; and as a matter of justice to the Indians, as well as \n     to the Government, the matter should be made right and \n     satisfactory to the Indians as soon as possible. . . . All \n     the Indians say emphatically that when the treaty was read to \n     them no mention was made of their giving up the right to \n     fish. All that was said was that they were to agree not to \n     leave the reservation without getting passes, . . . The fact \n     is they were wilfully and wickedly deceived.\n\n  In 1886, Warm Springs Agent Jason Wheeler reported to the \nCommissioner of the Indian Affairs in Washington, DC, regarding the \n1865 treaty that ``if ever a fraud was villainously perpetrated on any \nset of people, red or white, this was, in my opinion, certainly one of \nthe most glaring.'' In 1887, Commissioner of Indian Affairs J.D.C. \nAtkins, in his annual report to the Secretary of the Interior, cited a \nrecent War Department report by Gen. John Gibbons that:\n\n     called attention to the oft-repeated, and I may say very \n     generally credited, story of fraud in the treaty of 1865, \n     whereby the Warm Springs Indians were, it is claimed, cheated \n     out of their fishery by the Huntington treaty. Salmon,\n\nhe wrote:\n\n     is material and of grave importance to them. It is their \n     principal source of subsistence, and they never intended to \n     part with it, but were cheated and swindled out of it by a \n     cunning and unprincipled U.S. official. I would recommend \n     your early attention to the matter upon the convening of \n     Congress.\n\n  Mr. President, those are the words of representatives of the American \nGovernment assessing this kind of a fraud perpetrated upon the Warm \nSpring Indians in the 1870's and 1880's.\n  Mr. President, that report, along with the many others, along with \nappeals made by the tribes, apparently fell on deaf ears. But while the \n1865 treaty remains on the books, the United States has never enforced \nit and the Tribes of the Warm Springs Reservation have continued the \nuninterrupted exercise of their 1855 off-reservation fishing, hunting, \ngathering, and grazing rights. The 1865 treaty has been effectually \nrendered null, disregarded by the tribes and the United States as a \nfraud from virtually the time it was signed. It is doubtful that the \n1865 treaty has any legal validity. Moreover, in the intervening years, \nthe Federal courts and the U.S. Congress have repeatedly recognized the \nWarm Springs Tribes' rights secured under the 1855 Treaty.\n\n  Mr. President, the legislation I introduce today declares the \nfraudulent 1865 treaty to be null and void. At the request of the Warm \nSprings Tribes, my bill will at long last correct this historical \ntravesty. I wish to note that, other than formally nullifying what for \nmany years has been a nullity in practice, this legislation will not \nalter the recognized 1855 rights of the Confederated Tribes of the Warm \nSprings Reservation. This legislation is more of a housekeeping \nmeasure--albeit housekeeping that will help the honor of the United \nStates and dignity of a long-wronged people.\n  It is my understanding that both the chairman and ranking member of \nthe Indian Affairs Committee are supportive of this proposal. The same \nis true for the administration. On that basis, I hope this matter can \nbe addressed in an expeditious manner.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BREAUX (for himself, Mr. Faircloth, Mr. Heflin, Mr. \n        Inhofe, Mr. Helms, and Mr. Mack):\n  S. 2103. A bill to amend title 17, United States Code, to protect \nvessel hull designs against unauthorized duplication, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n\n                    the boat protection act of 1996\n\n Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, today I am introducing a bill, \nentitled the Boat Protection Act of 1996. The bill will attempt to stop \nan increasingly common problem facing America's marine manufacturers--\nthe unauthorized copying of boat hull designs. Such piracy threatens \nthe integrity of the U.S. marine manufacturing industry and the safety \nof American boaters.\n  A boat manufacturer invests significant resources in creating a safe, \nstructurally sound, high performance boat hull design from which a line \nof vessels can be manufactured. Standard practice calls for \nmanufacturing engineers to create a hull model, or plug, from which \nthey cast a mold. This mold is then used for mass production of boat \nhulls. Unfortunately, those intent on pirating such a design can simply \nuse a finished boat hull to develop their own mold. This copied mold \ncan then be used to manufacture boat hulls identical in appearance to \nthe original line, and at a cost well below that incurred by the \noriginal designer.\n  This so-called hull splashing is a significant problem for consumers, \nmanufacturers, and boat design firms. American consumers are defrauded \nin the sense that they do not benefit from the many aspects of the \noriginal hull design that contribute to its structural integrity and \nsafety, and they are not aware that the boat they have purchased has \nbeen copied from an existing design. Moreover, if original \nmanufacturers are undersold by these copies, they may no longer be \nwilling to invest in new, innovative boat designs--boat designs that \ncould provide safer, less expensive, quality watercraft for consumers.\n  A number of States have enacted anti-boat-hull-copying, or plug mold, \nstatutes to address this problem of hull splashing. These States \ninclude my State of Louisiana, as well as Alabama, California, Florida, \nIndiana, Kansas, Maryland, Mississippi, Missouri, Tennessee, and \nWisconsin. However, a decision by the U.S. Supreme Court in Bonito \nBoats versus Thundercraft Boats,\n\n[[Page S11094]]\n\nInc., invalidated these State statutes on the basis of Federal patent \nlaws preemption. The legislation I am introducing today would address \nthe concerns of hull splashing without attempting to amend the patent \nare copyright laws.\n  Such nonintrusive initiatives are not new to Congress. In 1984, \nCongress acted to protect the unique nature of design work when it \npassed the Semiconductor Chip Protection Act. This act was designed to \nprotect the mask works of semiconductor chips, which are essentially \nthe molds form which the chips are made, against unauthorized \nduplication. I believe that the approach Congress took in that \nlegislation would also be sufficient to protect boat hull designs.\n  The Boat Protection Act of 1996 would work in concert with current \nFederal law to protect American marine manufacturers from harmful and \nunfair competition. I am introducing this bill today as a demonstration \nof my commitment to the immediate resolution of this problem, and since \nenactment of this legislation during the remaining days of the 104th \nCongress is unlikely, I intend to pursue this issue as priority in the \n105th Congress.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the Boat Protection Act of 1996 and \nto join in this effort to protect the American public and the marine \nmanufacturing community from the assault on American ingenuity caused \nby hull splashing.\n       By Mr. WARNER (for himself, Mr. Robb, Mr. Sarbanes and Ms. \n     Mikulski):\n\n  S.J. Res. 62. A joint resolution granting the consent of the Congress \nto amendments made by Maryland, Virginia, and the District of Columbia \nto the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Regulation Compact; to the \nCommittee on the Judiciary.\n\n\nThe Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Regulation Compact Amendments \n                              Act of 1996\n\n Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I am introducing legislation today \nwhich would grant the consent of Congress to amendments made by the \nCommonwealth of Virginia, the State of Maryland, and the District of \nColumbia to the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Regulation \nCompact. The compact amendments that are being proposed today govern \nhow the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority (WMATA), better \nknown as ``Metro'', conducts its daily operations as a transit \nprovider.\n  The Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority was established in \n1967 by Congress when it consented to an Interstate Compact created by \nVirginia, Maryland, and the District of Columbia. The authority was \nestablished to plan, finance, construct and operate a comprehensive \npublic transit system for the Metropolitan Washington area. Today, \nMetro operates 1,439 buses and 764 rail cars serving the entire \nnational capital region. The Metrorail System, sometimes called \n``America's Subway'' has 89 miles and 74 stations currently in service. \nOver the next several years, Metro will construct another 13.5 miles of \nthe rail system, with the planned 103-mile rail system being completed \nin 2001.\n  The Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority Compact has been \namended five times since its inception. The amendments that are before \nthe Committee are a sixth set of amendments that will enable the \ntransit agency to perform its functions more efficiently and cost \neffectively.\n  The proposed amendments primarily, and most importantly, modify the \nAuthority's procurement practices to conform with recently enacted \nfederal procurement reforms. Currently, the Authority must use a sealed \nbid process in purchasing capital items. As you can imagine, the \nAuthority conducts extensive procurement in constructing the rail \nsystem. The proposed amendments will enable Metro to engage in \ncompetitive negotiations on capital contracts, as an alternative to the \nsealed bid process. This amendment is particularly important as a means \nfor the Authority to reduce its costs.\n\n  The transit agency will be better able to define selection criteria \nand eliminate costly items from bid proposals. If a prospective \ncontractor recommends a change in a bid specification, under the \nproposed amendment that Authority will be able to take advantage of \nthis cost savings.\n  The proposed amendments will also allow the Authority to raise its \nsimplified purchasing ceiling from $10,000 to the federal level. The \nFederal Transit Administration, part of the U.S. Department of \nTransportation, has encouraged states and localities to raise the \ndollar threshold for small purchases to $100,000 to come into \nconformity with Federal procedures. The Authority and the jurisdictions \nit serves strongly endorse this proposed amendment, allowing the \nAuthority to conduct its business in an efficient, business-like \nmanner, rather than being required to publish voluminous bid \nspecifications, even on small purchases. Under this revision, WMATA \nwill be able to publish a simplified bid specification and accept price \nquotations, thus streamlining its procurement procedures. Given \ninflation rates over the past several years, this amendment provides a \nmuch better definition of ``small purchase'' for a government agency.\n  Finally, there are several administrative matters addressed in the \nproposed compact amendments that are certainly of a housekeeping \nnature. These amendments are largely codifications and clarifications \nof current practices. They relate to, for example, the primacy of D.C. \nSuperior Court in cases involving WMATA, and the definition of a quorum \nat WMATA Board meetings.\n  This joint resolution is of the utmost importance to the Washington \nMetropolitan Area Transit Authority.

Mr. President, I rise today to recognize Nichols \nResearch Corp. of Huntsville, AL, which is celebrating its 20th year of \ntechnological leadership. For the past two decades, Nichols Research \nCorp. has made significant technological contributions to our Nation, \nand in so doing has shown itself to be a model example of the energy \nand dynamism of America's small businesses.\n  In 1976, Roy Nichols and Chris Horgen's small company consisted of a \nsingle office in Huntsville, AL, and a handful of employees. Since that \ntime, Nichols Research Corp. has achieved remarkable growth, now \nemploying 1,900 hard-working men and women in 27 offices nationwide. \nThe astonishing rise to prominence of this once tiny firm is vivid \nproof that in America, great ideas, professional excellence, and \nperseverance can lead to unlimited success.\n  Since its humble beginnings, Nichols Research Corp.'s prosperity has \nbeen driven by its leadership in technological innovation and its \nability to put its breakthrough ideas and professional know-how to work \nfor all of us. For much of its history, Nichols Research Corp. has \nconcentrated on developing technologies for America's defense. In \nrecent years, Nichols Research Corp. has begun using its vast expertise \nto expand into the field of information technology, a rapidly \nprogressing area which represents the vibrant future of the American \neconomy. The skills and techniques which Nichols Research Corp. has \ngained are now being used to develop solutions for Government agencies \nas well as health care, transportation, and insurance businesses in the \nprivate sector.\n  Not surprisingly, Nichols Research Corp.'s innovativeness and \nleadership have drawn well-deserved praise and recognition. In 1993, \nForbes magazine selected Nichols Research Corp. as 1 of only 13 firms \nfor its ``Best of the Best'' list of small companies in America. In \n1995, Nichols Research Corp. was named by the Department of Defense to \nits ``Top 100'' company list for research development testing and \nevaluation as well as other services and supplies. Today, I would like \nto recognize this small business success story for 20 years of growth \nand innovation, and congratulate Roy Nichols, Chris Horgen, and all of \nNichols Research Corp.'s employees for their outstanding \naccomplishments. I am certain that Nichols Research Corp. will continue \nto make valuable contributions to America's defense and economic \nprosperity for many years to come.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/20/senate-section/article/S11101-1", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "20", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11101-S11102]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 WEST VIRGINIA'S TRIBUTE TO JOHN HENRY\n\n Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, on July 12-14, 1996, a 6-foot \nreplica of a stamp honoring legendary railroad worker John Henry was \nthe centerpiece of a weekend of festivities in the small town of \nTalcott in Summers County, WV. This stamp was part of a set of four \nfolk hero stamps recently issued by the U.S. Postal Service also \nhonoring Paul Bunyan, Pecos Bill, and the Mighty Casey. The Postal \nService had initially only planned to announce the stamp in Pittsburgh \nand issue it in Anaheim, CA, at an annual show. However, I am proud to \nhave been part of an effort launched by my colleague, Congressman Nick \nRahall, and the residents of Talcott to ensure that this folk legend \nand this great town which gave him birth were honored with a \npersonalized unveiling and stamp cancellation ceremony.\n  In the latter part of 1995, the townspeople of Talcott were \ndisappointed to learn that the U.S. Postal Service announced in \nPittsburgh, PA, instead of West Virginia, the design of a 1996 stamp \nhonoring John Henry. I asked for the rationale behind this decision and \nwas advised by the Postal Service that this site was selected because \nof the city's linkage to railroad yards. While I could easily \nunderstand such a ``thematic'' or ``geographical'' approach--a Steel-\nDriving Man being recognized in the ``Steel City''--virtually all of \nthe residents of my State strongly believed that John Henry's legend is \nbased on the classic tale of his competition against the mechanical \nsteam drill at Big Bend Mountain in Talcott. So it only would make \nsense for West Virginians to be able to celebrate the legend of John \nHenry and the issuance of his stamp with an appropriate ceremony of \ntheir own.\n  I asked the Postmaster General to plan a special ceremony in West \nVirginia for the John Henry stamp. I also urged him to organize a \nspecific event in Talcott related to the 1996 John Henry stamp as the \nhome of this folk legend.\n  The fact that West Virginia is the true home of the John Henry legend \nmade it a natural choice for a special recognition ceremony to \ncelebrate the emergence of this new stamp. John Henry's fame has \nfascinated millions of people throughout the world and continues to \ninterest new generations to this day. He is a symbol of the importance \nof human determination and skill, which is increasingly meaningful \ngiven the rise of technology in today's culture. His significance in \nrepresenting human labor and a tireless work ethic also play a \ncompelling role in West Virginia's history.\n\n[[Page S11102]]\n\n  But overall, to emphasize why this issue is so important, it is \nnecessary to understand the legend and his link to West Virginia. Let \nme share with you a little of the history.\n  The details of the John Henry folklore sprang from the construction \nof the Big Bend Tunnel on the Chesapeake and Ohio railroad in Talcott \nin 1873. Various stories led to the legend of John Henry; but, \nunfortunately, no documentation exists because earlier C Railroad \nrecords were destroyed in a fire in 1880. Local historians do know that \nfrom 1870 to 1872, a gang of hand-drillers working from the railroad \nactually carved out rock from the Big Bend Mountain for the railroad. \nThis tunnel stands as proof today that the legend of John Henry has \nroots in reality, and a statue of this folk hero tops this tunnel.\n  John Henry was assumed to be an African-American slave who worked on \nthe team of Big Bend Tunnel drillers. Famed Appalachia folklore \nhistorian Dr. James Gay Jones of Glenville, WV, noted in his 1979 book, \n``Haunted Valley, and More Folk Tales of Appalachia,'' that of all the \nrailroad workers in the area of the time, a man known as John Henry was \nheld in the highest esteem because of his prowess, immense size, brute \nstrength, and great labor ethic. John Henry ``became known as a driver \nof steel,'' that is, he used these great sledgehammers to drive steel \nrods deep into red shale rock walls. The rods were then removed, \nexplosives were placed in them, and portions of the wall were removed \nblast by blast.\n  When a new steam power drill, the Burleigh, was brought to the Big \nBend Tunnel for testing purposes, legend has it that John Henry agreed \nto a wager to see if he could drive more steel and clear more tunnel \nthan the machine. A contest was held, and the legend is that John Henry \ndrove a deeper hole than the machine. It is the contest in the \nmountains of West Virginia that created the legend and made the point \nthat man can triumph in the competition against machine.\n  There is some controversy over how and when John Henry died. Some \nclaim that he died because of the contest when a blood vessel burst in \nhis head. Others say he was killed in a rock fall in the Big Bend \nTunnel. Regardless of the circumstance, his legend was born and \nnurtured by West Virginia to share with the world, and it lives on \ntoday. It is a bit of West Virginia's contribution to basic folklore \nwhich has enriched our Nation's culture and heritage, and West \nVirginians like me are very proud to take an active part in recognizing \nand preserving this heritage.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/20/senate-section/article/S11101-2", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "20", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11102]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    NATIONAL POW/MIA RECOGNITION DAY\n\n Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, today in our Nation's Capital, the \nofficially recognized black and white POW/MIA flag is flying over the \nU.S. Capitol Building, the White House, the State Department, the \nDepartment of Veterans Affairs, the Vietnam Veterans Memorial, the \nKorean War Veterans Memorial, and at national cemeteries across the \ncountry. Throughout the State of New Hampshire, concerned citizens have \nbeen gathering in Manchester, Derry, Meredith, and several other \ncommunities to renew our commitment to the fullest possible accounting \nof prisoners of war and missing in action personnel. Likewise, there \nare services being held across the country.\n  For 12 years in Congress, I have been proud to be a leader on the \nPOW/MIA issue on behalf of their families, our Nation's veterans, and \nconcerned Americans. This is an honorable cause that we have embarked \non, and we must not stop until we know the truth, and until we can \nensure that this national tragedy can never be allowed to happen again; \n2,146 American servicemen are still unaccounted for from the Vietnam \nWar, and over 8,100 are unaccounted for from the Korean War. There are \nover 100 American servicemen who were lost during cold war incidents, \nand we also cannot forget the 78,000 Americans who died during World \nWar II, even though we were not able to recover their remains.\n  As many of my colleagues and my constituents know, I have worked hard \nto find answers for the POW/MIA families. I have traveled to Russia, \nNorth Korea, Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia trying to convince these \nnations to be more forthcoming with information. I authored the \nlegislation which created the Senate Select Committee on POW/MIA \nAffairs in 1991, and I did my very best as vice chairman to open the \nbooks on POW/MIA information which had previously been kept secret. I \nhave also worked to pass legislation to declassify Government records \non POW's and MIA's. Simply put, I have never let up on my commitment to \nthe POW/MIA issue, and as long as I serve in Congress, I never will.\n  Mr. President, I feel strongly that all of us have a solemn, moral \nobligation to continue thoroughly investigating this national tragedy \non behalf of the families who still wait for answers on the fate of \ntheir loved ones. Today, on National POW/MIA Recognition Day, I urge \nour Government leaders to renew our Nation's commitment to the fullest \npossible accounting of POW's and MIA's.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/20/senate-section/article/S11102-1", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "20", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11102]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     BUMPERS AMENDMENT TO H.R. 3662\n\n Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I would like to enter some remarks \nfor the record regarding the Bumpers grazing fee amendment to H.R. \n3662, the Interior appropriations bill.\n  In my view, if Federal policies are enacted that drive the small, \nindependent family rancher off the land, there will be many adverse \nconsequences for our country. I appreciate Senator Bumper's \nresponsiveness to my concerns about small, family ranches that led to a \n5,000 AUM cap instead of the original cap of 2,000 AUM.\n  This change, a 150-percent increase in AUM's over his initial \nproposed cap, resulted in an exemption from the fee increase for \napproximately 300 Oregon ranchers. Further, the amendment would not \nimpact most of the 2,100 permittees in Oregon.\n  There are, however, some small family ranchers who I remain concerned \nabout. A significant number of Oregon ranchers are small and \nindependent but they operate through one permittee, an incorporated \nfamily ranch. They are the folks I am concerned about. They include \nfamilies with multiple households who live on, work on, and derive \ntheir livelihood from the ranch. They are working together to provide \nfor their families, they provide generations worth of knowledge, and \nthey are active in associations and restoration work. It is those \nfamily ranches who hold permits to graze more than 5,000 AUM that will \nhave to pay the increased fee.\n  To address this problem, each legitimate, separate household on a \nfamily ranch should be recognized as an independent permittee or lessee \nfor the purposes of determining the grazing fee increase.\n  This should be done for a simple, yet very important reason. Multi-\ngenerational ranchers are the backbone of our land stewardship program. \nThey provide a unique knowledge of the land, are critical to \nmaintaining our national food supply, and are helping to ensure the \nlong-term protection of our rangeland resources. We need to assure that \nwe consider their needs as we look to the future of grazing on public \nlands.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/20/senate-section/article/S11102-2", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "20", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11102-S11103]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   WHY AFRICA MATTERS: INTERNATIONAL CRIME, TERRORISM, AND NARCOTICS\n\n Mrs. KASSEBAUM. Mr. President, I rise to continue a series of \nspeeches about why Africa matters to the United States. I have already \nspoken about our vulnerability to infectious diseases coming out of \nAfrica, and have addressed the many ways in which environmental crisis \nin Africa can touch Americans right here at home.\n  Today, I want to speak about a topic that many people believe will be \nthe primary security threat in the years ahead--international crime and \nterrorism. American corporations are spending increasing amounts of \nmoney to protect themselves from international criminal networks. Our \nchildren are still threatened by a thriving drug trade that links this \ncountry to narcotics centers around the globe. And after the World \nTrade Center bombings and the tragic loss of the passengers and crew of \nTWA flight 800, the threat of international terrorism has created a \nsense of insecurity in the American public such as we have never felt \nbefore.\n\n[[Page S11103]]\n\n                        weak state institutions\n\n  As the rise of criminal networks in the former Soviet Union has \nshown, weak state institutions and judiciaries create a climate for \ncrime to flourish--and Africa is no exception. West Africa is noted as \na hub for passport forgery; counterfeit money is produced in various \nAfrican urban centers, and criminal networks smuggle diamonds and ivory \nacross the continent's porous borders and overseas.\n  In some parts of the continent, soldiers and political officials use \ntheir formal occupations as an entry point to high-stakes criminal \nactivity, taking control of resources to finance crime and \nappropriating entire localities to serve as a base of operations. \nDiamonds, drugs, and arms are flowing to and from these individual \nfiefdoms, because no strong, capable financial or legal institutions \nexist to differentiate the legitimate from the illegitimate. Let me \ngive a few examples:\n  Warlords in Liberia use diamonds stolen from Sierra Leone to finance \ntheir contribution to Liberia's bloody conflict.\n  Not long ago, Angolan rebels were selling poached elephant ivory and \nsmuggled diamonds on international markets to raise funds for their \ncause.\n  The rise of mercenary movements on the continent is a testament to \nthis trend--mercenaries are often paid by allowing them access to \nresource-rich territories, further turning Africa into a free-for-all \nfor criminals seeking profit, while legitimate governments and \nbusinesses are increasingly marginalized.\n  Criminal networks in Nigeria defraud American citizens of millions of \ndollars each year. Yet, the Nigerian military government--itself \ninfected with corruption--does little to stop these acts.\n  And even in Africa's most developed economy--South Africa--the lack \nof effective and legitimate law enforcement has led to the growth of \ncrime and narcotics trafficking. Nearly 500 criminal networks are \nthought to operate in Johannesburg, dealing in cocaine, heroin, \nMandrax, diamonds, and ivory.\n\n\n                            narcotics flows\n\n  Not only does such activity threaten to destabilize one of the most \ninspiring success stories of this century, but it also threatens \nAmericans right here at home. Only one-tenth of the contraband in South \nAfrica is for local consumption--the rest finds its way to Europe and \nthe United States. In fact, approximately 30 to 40 percent of all hard \nnarcotics that enter the United States come via African drug cartels. \nThe drug world is becoming increasingly cosmopolitan: South American \ndrug lords are buying African banks to launder their illegal profits.\n  For years, the United States has thrown money at supply-side \nsolutions in South America that simply do not work. In Africa, we \nshould apply the lessons learned from that experience and address the \ninstitutional weaknesses that permit the drug trade to flourish. \nStronger and more transparent political and judicial systems must be \ndeveloped to stop the flow of narcotics from Africa.\n\n\n                        terrorism also a threat\n\n  Mr. President, international terrorists are no strangers to Africa. \nSudanese nationals were at the heart of the New York City bomb plots. \nThe Libyan Government still refuses to extradite the men believed to be \nresponsible for the bombing of PanAm flight 103. In 1995, a fraud \nscheme uncovered in South Africa revealed an international crime \nnetwork with close links to the Irish Republican Army.\n  In this era of instantaneous communications and world travel, all \nnations must join in the battle against international terrorism.

Mr. President, a decade ago, I was much involved \nin the drafting of the Tax Reform Act of 1986. A major objective of \nthat legislation was to simplify the Tax Code by eliminating a large \nnumber of loopholes that had come to be viewed as unfair because they \nprimarily benefitted small groups of taxpayers. One of the loopholes we \nsought to close in 1986 was one that permitted builders of professional \nsports facilities to use tax-exempt bonds. We had nothing against new \nstadium construction, but we made the judgment that scarce Federal \nresources could surely be used in ways that would better serve the \ngeneral public good.\n  The 1986 Act accordingly prohibited the use of private activity \nbonds--that is, bonds for non-governmental purposes--for professional \nsports facilities. Yet, despite Congress' action, sports team owners, \nwith help from clever tax counsel, soon found a way around the new law: \nthey persuaded local governments to issue tax-exempt public bonds to \nfinance new stadiums. As the columnist Neal R. Pierce wrote recently, \nteam owners ``were soon exhibiting the gall to ask mayors to finance \ntheir stadiums with general purpose bonds.'' We did not anticipate \nthis. It was--and still is--perfectly legal.\n  The result has been a boom unlike anything we have ever seen in \nconstruction of new tax-subsidized professional sports stadiums. In the \nlast 6 years alone, over $4 billion has been spent to build 30 new \nprofessional sports stadiums. According to Prof. Robert Baade, an \neconomist at Lake Forest College in Illinois and an expert in stadium \nfinancing, that amount could ``completely refurbish the physical plants \nof the Nation's public elementary and secondary schools.'' An \nadditional $7 billion of stadiums are in the planning stages, and there \nis no end in sight. This is why I recently introduced S. 1880--the Stop \nTax-exempt Arena Debt Issuance Act--or STADIA for short--to end the \nFederal tax subsidy for these stadium deals. Only the team owners and \nplayers profit, while taxpayers and fans pick up the tab.\n\n  I introduced S. 1880 with an immediate effective date of June 14, \n1996 for a number of reasons, which I have previously explained for the \nRecord. However, I also recognized, and requested comment on, ``the \nneed for equitable relief for stadiums already in the planning \nstages.'' On June 27, 1996, based upon initial comments I had received, \nI made a statement on the floor that projects that had binding \ncontracts or final bond resolutions in place on the date the bill was \nintroduced would not be affected by the bill. Since that time, several \nother localities with stadiums already in the planning stages have \nrequested equitable relief.\n  Given the Senate's imminent adjournment, it is now certain --as I \npredicted earlier--that S. 1880 will not be enacted into law this year. \nAccordingly, in order to provide needed certainty to those remaining \nlocalities that have expended significant time and funds in planning \nand financing professional sports facilities, I wish to indicate that \nwhen I reintroduce this legislation in the 105th Congress, its \neffective date will be the date of the first committee action. As \npractitioners in this field know, the date of first committee action is \na common effective date for this type of legislation. In addition, I \nwill include the transition relief provision contained in my June 27 \nfloor statement.\n  This, I believe, strikes the proper balance between closing the \nloophole in present law--a loophole that benefits only team owners and \ntheir players--and addressing the concerns of those localities that \nhave been planning new stadiums.\n  Mr. President, I ask that four recent articles regarding this \nlegislation be printed in the Record.\n  The articles follow:\n\n               [From the National Journal, July 20, 1996]\n\n                   Calling Time on Sports Tax Breaks\n\n                          (By Neal R. Peirce)\n\n       Washington.--Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan. D-N.Y., stirred \n     up a virtual hornet's nest last month with a bill to forbid \n     use of federal tax-exempt bonds to finance sports stadiums \n     for private teams.\n       It turns out that from Nashville to Cleveland, Seattle to \n     Denver, New Orleans to New York and multiple points in \n     between, mayors and councils are readying bond issues to \n     finance close to $7 billion worth of baseball, basketball, \n     football and hockey facilities.\n\n[[Page S11104]]\n\n       The first deal imperiled was a $60 million bond sale by the \n     city of Nashville, just one part of the tax-free bonding \n     package that the city is assembling to pay for a $292 million \n     state-of-the-art stadium to lure the Oilers football team \n     from Houston.\n       So when Moynihan suggested barring tax-free financing for \n     such deals, retroactive to June 14, the day he introduced his \n     legislation, the buzz of angry protest was almost instant.\n       Moynihan's proposal was ``abrupt,'' it ``jeopardized' local \n     planning, city leaders said. It was a ``dangerous \n     precedent,'' the Public Securities Association asserted.\n       The political signals, for the Republican-controlled \n     Congress, seemed all wrong. ``No bill will go through the \n     House in terms of NFL [National Football League] that doesn't \n     include the Oilers being in Nashville,'' said House Speaker \n     Newt Gingrich, R-Ga. A spokesman for Senate Majority Whip Don \n     Nickles of Oklahoma said the Moynihan bill was not even ``on \n     the radar screen'' of the Republican leadership.\n       Within a few days Moynihan beat a tactical retreat, saying \n     that he would consider ``the need for equitable relief for \n     stadiums already in the planning stages.''\n       But Moynihan, the ranking Democrat on the Finance \n     Committee, is not backing away from his bill. And rather than \n     being pilloried, he should be hailed as a hero of the times--\n     an invaluable whistle-blower and friend to all U.S. \n     taxpayers.\n       Let's get it straight. Unless current federal law is \n     changed, interest payments from the billions of dollars of \n     forthcoming stadium bonds will be totally tax-free to the \n     affluent investors who buy them. These are general-purpose \n     bonds--which Congress intended for financing such truly \n     public purposes as roads, sewers, schools, libraries and \n     other public buildings.\n       And who will benefit from this largesse? Joe Six-Pack, who \n     often can't afford the seats in these opulent new stadiums \n     and who'll surely never darken the door of one of their ritzy \n     skyboxes? Of course not.\n       The real winners are the owners and professional sports \n     teams, who are utterly proficient in blackmailing local \n     officials: ``Buy me my stadium, rent it to me for a pittance \n     or nothing, channel the ticket and concession revenue to me, \n     and if you don't like my deal, I'll skip town and leave you, \n     Mr. Mayor, with egg all over your face for having lost a \n     team.''\n       Moynihan, to his credit, has been at this struggle for \n     years. In the mid-1980s, many stadiums were financed by low-\n     interest, tax-exempt private revenue bonds. Owners paid off \n     the cost over 30 or 40 years. But the federal taxpayer was \n     clipped, because no taxes were collected. Moynihan's answer \n     was to write conditions into the 1986 tax reform law that \n     virtually choked off such revenue bonds.\n       The owners were checkmated--but not for long. They were \n     soon exhibiting the gall to ask mayors to finance their \n     stadiums with general-purpose bonds.\n       And what a deal this was for them! At concessionary prices, \n     they rent (but are not ultimately responsible for) their \n     stadiums. And they are relieved of repaying the bonds: The \n     local taxpayers get to take care of that for them.\n       As for the tax-free interest payments--well, Uncle Sam can \n     take it on the chin as lost revenue. Moynihan notes that one \n     result is ``forcing the taxpayers in the team's current \n     hometown to pay for the team's new stadium in a new city.''\n       But mayors found it tough to say no. Federal and state aid \n     was shrinking. If not another city, nearby rapacious suburbs \n     would bid for their sports teams. So many said yes. They'd \n     keep (or sometimes gain) a team. But at a price--adding \n     municipal indebtedness, a possible threat to the city's \n     credit standing and thus higher borrowing costs for schools, \n     colleges, and other public investments, even while stadium \n     investors escaped taxes.\n       This is the cavernous tax loophole Moynihan wants to close. \n     In time, he's likely to win. As the federal budget vise \n     tightens--forcing program after program to constrict--mega-\n     subsidies to fat-cat sports owners will become even more \n     reprehensible.\n       The sooner Congress acts, the better for us all. And the \n     quicker cities wise up and resist the team owners' threats \n     and demands, the better.\n       Without question, the cost of sports subsidies have begun \n     to reach stratospheric levels. The Congressional Research \n     Service (CRS), in a May report, calculated that Baltimore's \n     football stadium subsidies to attract the former Cleveland \n     Browns will be $127,000 for each job created--almost 21 times \n     more than the $6,250 it cost to create jobs through \n     Maryland's economic development fund.\n       Does the national economy benefit? No. CRS reported: \n     ``Almost all stadium spending is spending that would have \n     been made on other activities within the United States.'' Net \n     benefits, therefore, are ``near zero.''\n       A hero on this score, maybe a pioneer, is Houston Mayor Bob \n     Lanier, who has focused city funds on bolstering police, \n     rebuilding neighborhoods, cleaning out sewers and sprucing up \n     parks.\n       When Oilers owner Bud Adams applied pressure for incentives \n     to stay in Houston, Lanier just said no. All that Nashville \n     will get for a total incentive pool of $650 million, Lanier \n     noted, is 10 home games a year. The same cash, he told a \n     reporter, would almost finish the job of cleaning up \n     Houston's depressed neighborhoods.\n       If a few more mayors got their priorities as straight as \n     Lanier's, the team owners would have fewer cities to prey on.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n                 [From the U.S.A. Today, June 28, 1996]\n\n                          Socked for Stadiums\n\n       Hey, sports fans, here's some good news, at least if you're \n     a federal taxpayer, too:\n       Nashville, Tenn., has put a $60 million stadium bond sale \n     on hold for a couple of weeks. The reason: Sen. Daniel \n     Patrick Moynihan, D.-N.Y., introduced legislation this month \n     that would take away federal tax exemptions on bonds used to \n     build sports facilities.\n       The tax break has helped fund a bidding war for sports \n     teams, leading teams such as the Oilers to leave Houston for \n     Nashville and the Browns to move from Cleveland to Baltimore \n     and become the Ravens.\n       And for no legitimate national purpose.\n       Wealthy owners get almost all the stadium revenues while \n     local, state and federal taxpayers pick up the bill.\n       Local jobs? The nonpartisan Congressional Research Service \n     (CRS) last month reported that Baltimore's football stadium \n     subsidies will cost $127,000 for each job created. That's 21 \n     times more than the $6,250 it costs to create jobs through \n     Maryland's economic development fund.\n       And the nation's economy? The CRS report notes: ``Almost \n     all stadium spending is spending that would have been made on \n     other activities within the United States.'' Thus, benefits \n     are ``near zero.''\n       If that. Communities that spend their own money on stadiums \n     often need federal aid for other programs. So federal \n     taxpayers get hit twice: first with tax exemptions that \n     reduce federal revenues, then with aid that increases \n     spending. Bad all around.\n       Moynihan's right. Get rid of the exemption. And then, cut \n     other federal aid, too. If local communities want to waste \n     their own money, that's up to them. But federal taxpayers \n     should be taken out of the arena.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n                [From the New York Post, Aug. 29, 1996]\n\n                           Let the Owners Pay\n\n                         (By Irwin M. Stelzer)\n\n       Whether Pat Moynihan was right in opposing the welfare-\n     reform bill that his party's President finally signed, only \n     time will tell. But that he is right in introducing a bill \n     that would stop cities from using tax-exempt bonds to finance \n     new arenas and stadiums for millionaire sports moguls, there \n     is no question.\n       If George Steinbrenner or some other team owner wants a new \n     stadium, and decides to finance it by selling bonds to \n     private investors, the interest he pays those lenders is \n     subject to federal income tax. But if a city sells bonds and \n     uses the proceeds to build a stadium for the Yankees, the \n     bond buyers--generally the most affluent members of society--\n     receive interest that is exempt from federal taxes.\n       Naturally, the city has to pay borrowers a lower interest \n     rate than would Steinbrenner or any other team owner. Experts \n     estimate that the cost of new facilities would rise by 15-20 \n     percent if teams were denied tax-exempt financing. This would \n     add $30-40 million to the cost of a typical football \n     stadium--enough to make several now on the drawing boards \n     unfeasible.\n       When a city does finance a stadium, it raises, the money \n     and then leases the facility to a team at some nominal rent--\n     leaving the owner free to rake in revenues from ticket sales, \n     television rights, parking, hot dogs and beer and, most \n     important, luxury boxes.\n       With Nashville, Cleveland, Denver, Seattle, New Orleans and \n     New York among the cities now in various stages of \n     considering such deals, Wall Street's bond machine is \n     preparing to issue about $7 billion in these bonds in the \n     next five to seven years, according to Fitch Investor \n     Services.\n       Of course, the federal treasury will have to make up the \n     lost revenue--something it can do only by collecting more in \n     taxes from ordinary citizens. Unfortunately, ordinary \n     citizens are no match for the huge lobbying effort that has \n     been launched against Moynihan's bill, and so Washington \n     insiders are giving it little chance of passing, either this \n     year or next.\n       But Moynihan, the ranking Democrat on the Senate Finance \n     Committee, is a persistent cuss--as his success in wringing \n     money out of the feds for the refurbishment of Penn Station \n     shows--and he is right. So right that the usually bland \n     National Journal says ``he should be hailed as a hero of the \n     times--an invaluable whistleblower and friend of all U.S. \n     taxpayers.''\n       The nation's mayors don't think so. They say it's none of \n     the feds' business which local projects they choose to \n     finance with their tax-exempt bonds. And they argue that the \n     construction of stadiums created jobs.\n       Finally, they speak of civic pride, of that certain je ne \n     sais quoi that goes out of a city when it loses a team to a \n     rival, and the boost it gets when it lures a new team or \n     retains an old one by offering its owner a cornucopia of \n     goodies.\n       They're wrong--on all three counts. Since tax-exempt city \n     bonds deprive the federal government of revenue, a U.S. \n     senator has every right to try to stop this practice.\n       As for jobs, a study by the Congressional Research Service \n     shows that the cost per job created by Baltimore's new \n     subsidized football stadium came to $127,000--compared with \n     $6,250 for jobs created by the state's economic development \n     fund.\n       Which brings us to civic pride, the toughest of all the \n     arguments to appraise. There\n\n[[Page S11105]]\n\n     can be no doubt that sports fans like having a home team to \n     root for. And that merchants in the area of the stadium \n     benefit from its presence.\n       But there is no free lunch--at least not for people unlucky \n     enough not to own a franchise in the NBA, NFL or Major League \n     Baseball. Tax money that the federal government does not \n     collect is not available for other things--education, health \n     care or tax cuts.\n       When a city gives a team the gift of rent below market \n     rates, or a special property tax deal, it deprives itself of \n     revenues it would otherwise have to repair its streets, hire \n     more cops, or spruce up its parks.\n       Which would boost New Yorkers' morale more: a stadium \n     athwart the West Side railroad tracks or streets that don't \n     break car axles and school buildings that don't leak?\n       Not an easy question, but one to which Houston mayor Bob \n     Lanier thinks he has the answer. When the Oilers tried to \n     roll his city for a new stadium he turned them down, telling \n     the press that with the money it would cost him to keep the \n     Oilers he could just about get the job of cleaning up \n     Houston's slum neighborhoods done.\n       Steinbrenner does have a real problem. Until lately, the \n     Yankees had been having a spectacular season, thanks in part \n     to The Boss' willingness to engage in the Daryl Strawberry \n     and Dwight Gooden rehabilitation projects.\n       But attendance has not responded proportionately: The \n     number of fans going to the Stadium is not as high as the \n     Yankees' won-lost record would warrant, according to a quick \n     comparison I have made with the league-wide relationship \n     between success on the field and success at the box office.\n       So Steinbrenner, who should not be expected to keep his \n     team in a place in which he cannot maximize his profits, has \n     every reason to shop around for a new site to which to take \n     his athletes when his lease is up in The Bronx. Just as the \n     Mets have every right to want a new field on which to display \n     their somewhat more problematic wares.\n       Moynihan has no objection to new sports emporia. ``Building \n     new professional sports facilities is fine with me,'' he \n     says. ``But, please, do not ask the American taxpayers to pay \n     for them.''\n       Whether or not the Senator gets his bill passed over the \n     kicking and screaming objections of the nation's politically \n     potent mayors, its bond-issuing investment bankers and its \n     itinerant team-owners, Mayor Giuliani would do well to take \n     Moynihan's advice.\n       Perhaps Donald Trump and Steinbrenner can strike a deal for \n     a privately financed stadium. Or perhaps New York has enough \n     reasons to be proud of its national and international \n     position to follow Houston's lead, and wave goodbye to its \n     sports mogul and his millionaire athletes.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n                 [From the Buffalo News, Aug. 11, 1996]\n\n Close Loophole That Has the Public Subsidizing Ever Glitzier Stadiums\n\n       If the public really is fed up with subsidizing wealthy \n     team owners and athletes, it will cheer a proposal to \n     eliminate the tax exemptions routinely granted bonds sold for \n     stadium projects.\n       The proposal comes from Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan, D-\n     N.Y. It should be especially cheered in places like Western \n     New York, whose sports teams will be constant targets for \n     raids by other cities as long as those cities lure them with \n     facilities built with the help of tax exempts.\n       Take away these indirect subsidies, and those cities will \n     not be able to dangle such enticing packages before team \n     owners.\n       In fact, take away the public subsidy and force teams to \n     build their own facilities, and maybe they won't be able to \n     spend a zillion dollars on second-string players. Instead, \n     the money now going into exorbitant salaries would have to be \n     used to build or fix up stadiums.\n       That could start a downward spiral--or at least a leveling \n     off--in player salaries that might even have a spillover \n     effect on ticket prices before they become totally out of \n     reach of the average family.\n       Moynihan's bill is not without its critics. County \n     Executive Gorski worries that eliminating the tax-exemption \n     on stadium bonds will make it harder for Erie County to \n     finance the $2.1 million needed to upgrade Rich Stadium. The \n     improvements are aimed at enticing the Buffalo Bills to sign \n     a new lease and stay in Western New York.\n       Gorski's view is understandable for a public official \n     interested only in the current negotiations.\n       But leases can be broken, as the former Cleveland Browns \n     illustrated. That team moved to Baltimore after being offered \n     a $200 million new stadium and financial enticements ranging \n     from free rent to all luxury-box, parking and stadium-ad \n     revenue.\n       Could Erie County really compete with that kind of civic \n     insanity--and does it really want it--if another community \n     eyes the Bills in a few years?\n       Eliminating the tax exemption for stadium bonds will make \n     it that much harder for another city to make that kind of \n     offer.\n       Granted, it might mean Erie County would pay a little more \n     for its bonds now. But it also would help assure the long-\n     term presence of sports teams in small markets like Buffalo.\n       And from a broader perspective, the measure would mean \n     taxpayers would no longer subsidize private sports \n     enterprises by funding what one congressional critic calls \n     ``a public-housing program for millionaires.\n       A Congressional Research Service study estimates the public \n     is losing nearly $100 million a year on sports facilities now \n     under construction. During one five-year period in the '80s, \n     those tax breaks cost taxpayers $18.2 billion.\n       Moynihan says that was never meant to be. The 1986 Tax \n     Reform Bill eliminated industrial development bonds, the \n     original vehicle for tax-exempt bond financing for stadiums. \n     But he says Congress didn't prohibit using governmental bonds \n     for stadiums because the ``possibility was too remote to have \n     occurred to us.''\n       But that loophole wasn't too remote for wide-eyed local \n     officials and profiteering team owners to uncover. Moynihan's \n     bill would close the loophole, saving taxpayers millions.\n       Those savings could be put to far better uses than helping \n     wealthy team owners play one city against another in the \n     stadium sweepstakes.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/20/senate-section/article/S11103-1", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "20", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11105]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    NATIONAL POW/MIA RECOGNITION DAY\n\n Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, today is National POW/MIA \nRecognition Day and I rise to honor those brave Americans whose fate \nremains uncertain. As we reflect not only on those courageous \nservicemembers who so valiantly went off in defense of their country, \nwe should also pause and remember the families and loved ones of those \nwho never returned. The family who received definite notice that a \nloved one was positively killed in action could mourn and grieve and \nlearn to cope with life alone; but those American families whose loved \nones were missing, prisoners, or unaccounted for, bear an additional \nburden--the burden of uncertainty. They cannot bury their loved ones \nand work through the grief that comes with loss. They live with doubt, \ndenial, and hope that somehow their son, husband, brother, or father \nwill some day come home.\n  There are 90,769 American servicemembers unaccounted for from wars in \nthe 20th century; 1,648 from World War I, 78,794 from World War II, \n8,177 from Korea, and 2,150 from Southeast Asia. We have made extensive \nefforts to gain full accounting for all these servicemembers. We \naggressively continue our talks with the Governments of Vietnam, \nCambodia, and Laos to gain information about the servicemen who went \nthere but did not return. Those efforts continue and have resulted in \ninformation about a few of our unaccounted-for servicemen and the \nrecovery of 20 sets of remains between October 1995 and March 1996. \nRecent efforts with North Korea have also provided long overdue \ninformation about missing Americans. Additionally, we recovered the \nremains of a World War II hero this year, allowing his family finally \nto say their last farewells. However, we must not allow these small \nsuccesses to make us complacent. We must continue our efforts and view \nthe successes of today not as an end, but as a beginning in our efforts \nto gain more information in the upcoming years.\n  Today, as we stop to look at the POW/MIA flag which flies not only in \nthe rotunda of our Nation's Capitol but all around this great country, \nI hope all Americans will pause and remember with pride, sadness, and \nhope for the future, the valiant efforts of these brave soldiers, \nsailors, airmen, and marines who answered the call.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/20/senate-section/article/S11105-1", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "20", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11105]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nCONCERNING A HOLD ON S. 555, A BILL TO AMEND THE PUBLIC HEALTH SERVICE \n                                  ACT\n\n Mr. WYDEN.

Mr. President, with the recent passage of the \nHealth Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, and the \npossible enactment of several health benefit provisions, I'd like to \ndraw my colleagues' attention to a recently completed GAO report that \nsurveys similar State health insurance regulations and their impact on \nthe cost of health insurance.\n  I asked the GAO to examine the added costs associated with: First, \npremium taxes and other assessments; second, mandated health benefits; \nthird, finanancial solvency standards; and fourth, State health \ninsurance reforms affecting small employers. The report examines the \nimpact of these requirements on the cost of insured health plans \ncompared with the cost of self-funded health plans subject to the \nEmployee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 [ERISA].\n  Although States regulate health insurance, the study indicates that \nState regulation does not directly affect 4 out of 10 people. ERISA \npreempts States from directly regulating employer provision of health \nplans, but it permits States to regulate health insurers. Of the 114 \nmillion Americans with health coverage offered through a private \nemployer in 1993, about 60 percent participated in insured health plans \nthat are subject to State insurance regulation. However, for plans \ncovering the remaining 40 percent, about 44 million people in 1993, the \nemployer chose to self-fund and retain some financial risk for its \nhealth plan.\n  Because self-funded health plans may not be deemed to be insurance, \nERISA preempts them from State insurance regulation and premium \ntaxation. Although ERISA includes fiduciary standards to protect \nemployee benefit plan participants and beneficiaries from plan \nmismanagement, in other areas, such as solvency standards, no Federal \nrequirements comparable to State requirements for health insurers exist \nfor self-funded health plans.\n  Most States mandate that insurance policies include certain benefits, \nsuch as mammography screening and mental health services, which raises \nclaims costs to the extent that the benefits would not otherwise have \nbeen provided. In general, the report indicates that the costs are \nhigher in States with more mandated benefits and in States that mandate \nmore costly benefits.\n  State financial solvency standards have limited potential effect on \ncosts because many insurers already exceed the State minimum \nrequirements. In addition, due to their recent enactment, the cost \nimplications of small employer health insurance reforms, such as \nguaranteed issue, portability and rate restrictions, remain unclear.\n  Mr. President, I feel this report provides useful information \nregarding the benefits associated with State health insurance \nregulation and their impact on the cost of health insurance. Further, \nit points out the lack of similar requirements for self-insured plans \nand that more and more small employers are self-funding their health \nplans. As we continue our efforts to ensure that all Americans have \naccess to health care services, this report will help us better \nunderstand the experiences of the States and build upon them.\n  I ask that the executive summary of the report be printed in the \nRecord.\n  The summary follows:\n\nHealth Insurance Regulation: Varying State Requirements Affect Cost of \n                               Insurance\n\n\n                            RESULTS IN BRIEF\n\n       State health insurance regulation imposes requirements on \n     health plans offered by insurers that employers' self-funded \n     health plans do not have. These requirements benefit \n     consumers; they also add costs to insured health plans. The \n     extent to which these requirements increase insured health \n     plans' costs compared with self-funded health plans' costs \n     varies by state. The cost impact depends on the nature and \n     scope of each state's regulations and on health plans' \n     typical operating practices.\n       State premium taxes and other assessments are the most \n     direct and easily quantifiable cost that insured health plans \n     face. Premium taxes increase costs to commercial health \n     insurers by about 2 percent in most states. Other assessments \n     not only tend to be smaller than the premium tax but can \n     often be deducted from premium taxes. These include \n     assessments for guaranty funds that pay the claims of \n     insolvent plans and high-risk pools that provide coverage for \n     individuals unable to get private coverage because of \n     preexisting conditions.\n       Most states mandate that insurance policies cover certain \n     benefits and types of providers, such as mammography \n     screening, mental health services, and chiropractors, which \n     raises claims costs to the extent that such benefits would \n     not otherwise have been covered. The cost effect varies due \n     to differences in state laws and employer practices. For \n     example, Virginia's mandated benefits accounted for about 12 \n     percent of claims costs, according to a recent study. Earlier \n     studies estimated that mandated benefits represented 22 \n     percent of claims in Maryland and 5 percent in Iowa. In \n     general, such cost estimates are higher in states with more \n     mandated benefits and in states that mandate more costly \n     benefits, such as mental health services and substance abuse \n     treatment. These cost estimates represent the potential costs \n     of mandated benefits to a health plan that does not \n     voluntarily offer these benefits. Because most self-funded \n     plans offer many of the mandated benefits, their additional \n     claims cost--were they required to comply--would not be as \n     high as the studies' estimates. If required to comply with \n     state mandates, however, self-funded plans would lose \n     flexibility in choosing what benefits to offer and in \n     offering a single, uniform health plan across states.\n       State financial solvency standards have limited potential \n     effect on costs because many insurers exceed the state \n     minimum requirements and typically perform tasks like those \n     associated with the state financial reporting requirements. \n     Most insurers maintain higher levels of capital and surplus \n     than the minimum state requirements, indicating that the \n     effect of the capital and surplus requirements on health \n     insurance costs is generally minimal. Although states require \n     financial information and actuarial reports that in some \n     cases differ from the insurers' general business practices, \n     insurance executives indicated that the added administrative \n     cost of preparing these documents was marginal and that the \n     additional information was also valuable to the insurer.\n       The cost implications of small employer health insurance \n     reforms, such as limits on preexisting condition exclusions \n     recently adopted in many states, remain unclear. The cost \n     information to date is mostly anecdotal and provides an \n     incomplete view of these reforms' effects. Moreover, the \n     rapid changes in health care markets, such as the continued \n     growth and evolution of managed care, make it difficult to \n     isolate the independent effect of the reforms.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/20/senate-section/article/S11106-1", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "20", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11106-S11107]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n     SONS OF ITALY FOUNDATION EIGHTH ANNUAL NATIONAL EDUCATION AND \n                         LEADERSHIP AWARDS GALA\n\n Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I want to congratulate the Sons \nof Italy Foundation [SIF] for its eighth annual National Education and \nLeadership Awards [NELA] gala, which was held May 2, 1996, at the \nAndrew W. Mellon Auditorium, in Washington, DC. I had the opportunity \nof attending this worthy and inspirational event, and I have had the \nhonor of serving as chairman of the NELA gala in the past. This worthy \nand inspirational annual event has gained wide recognition during the \npast few years in Congress, the corporate community, educational \ninstitutions, and others in the philanthropic community throughout the \nNation for its promotion of educational excellence and professional \nachievement. I commend the SIF for the encouragement it provides to \nsome of our Nation's most outstanding young scholars and future \nleaders.\n  At this year's event, the SIF presented scholarships to the winners \nof the 1996 National Leadership Grant Competition, an annual merit-\nbased national scholarship competition. In addition, the SIF presented \nthe 1996 NELA's to Northwest Airlines Corp. Cochairman Alfred Checchi \nand Pennsylvania State University football coach Joseph V. Paterno. In \nselecting Messrs. Checchi and Paterno for this honor and in awarding a \nmerit-based academic scholarship in each of their names, the SIF has \nrecognized two of the most outstanding role models in the Italian-\nAmerican community.\n  The lives of these two men of enormous achievement and strong \ncharacter serve as reminders of why our forebears traveled to this \ncountry and why today's immigrants are so eager to make their homes in \nour great country, where opportunity abounds for those willing to learn \nand work hard. The achievements of these two men speak highly of the \nimportance of strong family support, educational achievement, and \nprofessional integrity. These are values on which all of us agree, \nregardless of our racial, ethnic, or religious backgrounds. These \ncommon values, aptly expressed through the NELA gala, are what bind us \nas Americans. Most appropriately, the scholarships that the SIF awarded\n\n[[Page S11107]]\n\nin the names of Mr. Checchi and Mr. Paterno will support the dreams and \naspirations of outstanding young students. There is no more important \nwork for us to perform, no greater gift we can give than to support our \nyouth.\n  The long and distinguished record of generous support for education \nearned by the SIF and its parent organization, the Order Sons of Italy \nin America, should be recognized and praised. These generous \ncontributions in support of the future of our Nation are made largely \nby the modest and heartfelt donations of the hundreds of thousands of \nOSIA members throughout our United States. During the past three \ndecades, OSIA and the SIF have distributed more than $21 million in \nacademic scholarships. The leaders and members of OSIA and the SIF have \nset an excellent example for other nonprofit and fraternal \norganizations in their unselfish support of the young people of our \nNation.\n  I commend Mr. Paul S. Polo, national president of OSIA and chairman \nof the SIF; Mr. Valentino Ciullo, president of the SIF; Ms. Jo-Anne \nGauger, chairwoman of OSIA's National Education Committee; Mr. Joseph \nE. Antonini, 1996 NELA gala chairman; and Dr. Philip R. Piccigallo, \nnational executive director of the OSIA and the SIF, for their \nleadership roles in the 1996 NELA gala and the National Leadership \nGrant Competition.\n  Listed below are the names of the 12 winners of the 1996 National \nLeadership Grant Competition. These young men and women represent our \nNation's highest level of academic achievement and leadership \npotential. I offer congratulations and heartfelt wishes for future \nsuccess to: Mr. Michael Sollazzo, Henry Salvatori Scholarship; Mr. \nAndrea Mazzariello, Alfred Checchi Scholarship; Mr. Brian Iammartino, \nJoseph V. Paterno Scholarship; Ms. Jillian Catalanotti, Dr. Vincenzo \nSellaro Scholarship; Mr. Todd Builione, Carlone Family/Peter B. Gay \nScholarship; Mr. Ben Jamieson, Hon. Frank J.

Mr. President, David Pryor is a good friend of \nmine. Over the years, I have had the privilege of getting to know David \nand his wife Barbara quite well. I have attended several events he has \nsponsored in Texarkana, AR, to raise needed funds for charitable \norganizations. I even have traveled to Little Rock to speak at \ncolleges.\n  Mr. President, David Pryor is a legendary figure in this body and I \nhave followed his career with great interest and admiration. I recall \nthat he first began his public service in Washington as a Congressional \npage. Some time later he returned to Washington when he was elected to \nserve as a United States Congressman. In fact, for a while we served \ntogether in the House of Representatives. Aside from this association, \nI also have had the privilege of working closely with him on the Senate \nFinance Committee and the Senate Committee on Aging.\n  As many of my colleagues know, David Pryor is one of the President's \nbest and closest friends. This friendship has enabled him to go \ndirectly to the President on critical matters confronting the Senate. \nThat is an unusual and serious responsibility for a Senator to have, \nand David Pryor has acted commendably.\n  Mr. President, I personally will miss David Pryor's friendship. But, \nI also will miss his intelligence and counsel tremendously. \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/20/senate-section/article/S11107-1", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "20", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11107]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               SALUTE TO TENNESSEE OLYMPIAN JENNIFER AZZI\n\n Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I rise today to commend a young \nTennessean, Miss Jennifer Azzi, of Oak Ridge, on her performance with \nthe gold-medal winning U.S. Olympic women's basketball team, also known \nas the Real Dream Team.\n  Jennifer has been active in the sport of basketball for the past \ndecade, first, at Oak Ridge High School, then at Stanford University, \nand now the Olympics. Jennifer's commitment not only to the sport, but \nto continuing to improve her skills and play is the type of \ndetermination that makes our atheletes excel and bring home the gold, \ntime and time again.\n  She reminds us all that with determination, commitment and a little \nhelp, we can all be winners. At a recent party in her honor, Jennifer \nAzzi said that ``With success, comes responsibility.'' Modestly, she \ntells us that many people have helped her get to where she is and now \nshe wants to help others do the same. Following the Olympics, she began \nteaching at a basketball camp where she is helping today's youth build \ntheir skills and sportsmanship.\n  Jennifer's triumph on the court is remarkable, but more important is \nthe virtue of her skills and determination off the court. She is a true \nOlympian, competing for honor for herself and her country. The Olympics \nin Atlanta this year were a success for all Americans. But Jennifer's \nvictory was a bright, shining moment in a bright, shining basketball \ncareer for this young woman from east Tennessee. Looking at her record, \nI believe she has an even brighter future ahead.\n  Mr. President, Jennifer's victory reminds us of what the Olympics can \nbe for each of us--a competition between countries without casualties, \nonly peace; a contest of perseverance and love and the heart to win it \nall. Jennifer Azzi has all these qualities, and she has our repsect and \nadmiration too.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/20/senate-section/article/S11107-2", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "20", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11107-S11108]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               TRIBUTE TO GUY YOUNG, A NEW HAMPSHIRE HERO\n\n Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to Guy \nA. Young, a New Hampshire letter carrier, for his selfless and heroic \nacts performed while attempting to rescue a nine-month-old baby from a \nlife threatening traffic accident. On September 25, 1996, Guy Young of \nAllenstown, NH, will be presented with the National Association of \nLetter Carriers' Regional Hero of the Year Award for his courageous \nact.\n  Unfortunately, when faced with danger, many people turn the other way \nor, even worse, watch the accident, merely becoming bystanders. Guy \nYoung is not one of those people. Guy is a letter carrier for the U.S. \nPostal Service and serves the residents of Allenstown, NH. He was on \nhis usual route one morning recently when he noticed a major traffic \naccident had occurred at the intersection in front of him. Without \nthinking twice, Guy rushed to the scene, where he encountered the \ndriver, a frantic mother, screaming because her baby was still in the \noverturned van. Guy immediately climbed over shards of glass, through a \nbroken window, and searched for the infant. Not until he heard the \nbaby's horrific scream did he look up and see the baby dangling upside \ndown, still strapped into his car seat. Realizing that the van could \nburst into flames at any second, Guy desperately struggled with the \nbaby's seat belt until he finally forced it free. He then passed the 9-\nmonth-old infant out the window to the safety of his mother's arms. \nOnce the emergency vehicles arrived and assumed control of the \nsituation, Guy returned to his postal truck and continued delivering \nmail to the residents of Allenstown.\n  Guy is an example of a truly honorable New Hampshire citizen. Not \nonly did he risk personal injury to help a baby boy in danger, but he \nacted promptly and courageously. He is indeed a hero.\n  The National Association of Letter Carriers [NALC] honors a national \nhero, three regional heroes, a national humanitarian, and a branch \nservice awardee each year. Those awards are presented to individuals \nwho risk their lives for others, or who make personal contributions for \na worthy cause. The awards also give the NALC an opportunity to express \nits gratitude and appreciation to those letter carriers whose \nmeritorious service has earned theirselves honor. Guy undoubtedly \ndeserves this special recognition for his heroic act.\n  Mr. President, people who respond, as Guy did, in dangerous and life \nthreatening situations are indeed brave and\n\n[[Page S11108]]\n\nunselfish. Without Guy's immediate reaction, a 9-month-old infant may \nnot have survived. I am proud to call Guy Young one of New Hampshire's \nspecial citizens. He has truly made us all very proud of him. \nCongratulations Guy, on a job well done!\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/20/senate-section/article/S11107-3", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "20", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11108]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           ORDER OF PROCEDURE\n\n  Mr. DORGAN.

Mr. President, today, as is the case on most days when \nthe Senate is in session, we have seen in morning business a block of \ntime offered to those who come to the floor to describe what is wrong \nwith the Senate, what is wrong with the President, and why the \nrevolution that was offered at the start of the 104th Congress has \nfailed to achieve its goals. In fact, today one of the speakers said, \nwell, the reason the Senate is still in session is because the people \non this side of the aisle --the Democrats--are keeping the Senate in \nsession for political purposes, apparently, not letting those who want \nto go home to go home.\n  I listened to that. I thought to myself, this is a very curious \nstatement from someone who is a Member of the Senate. Anyone who is a \nMember of the Senate would probably know that we have not done our \nwork. We are supposed to pass appropriations bills. That is what funds \nthe functions of Government. The fact is, the largest appropriations \nbill that we passed in the year has not been completed. Four \nappropriations bills will likely now be rolled into a continuing \nresolution--I guess five appropriations bills rolled into a continuing \nresolution--and not adopted by this Congress at all. The requirement is \nthat is supposed to be done by September 30. It will not be done. The \nCongress will not have done its work. The Congress will not have \nfollowed the requirements in law.\n  So we will pass what is called a continuing resolution, which is \ndefined as a legislative failure because the Congress didn't do the job \nit was supposed to do. We are still here because the Congress has not \ncompleted its work. That is not rocket science. If the Congress does \nnot get its job done, it ought not go home.\n  Well, this has been a remarkable Congress by any measurement. I \nunderstand why some want to go home. In fact, the very people who want \nto go home quickly now are the people who couldn't wait to get here at \nthe start of the Congress to begin the revolution--a rather curious, \nunusual revolution that said we want to serve in Government because we \ndo not like Government; what we would like to do is provide a very \nlarge tax cut. Much of that will go to upper-income Americans and pay \nfor it by cutting the Medicare Program, most of which helps lower-\nincome Americans.\n  And they said we have a new economic plan for America as well. Let me \ndescribe it to you--not in my words, but in the words of a former \nRepublican, a columnist who described it this way. He said:\n\n       Their economic plan proposed that you take the 20 percent \n     of the people with the lowest incomes, and say to those \n     people, ``You are now going to bear the burden of 80 percent \n     of the spending cuts that we propose in Government.''\n\nThe same economic plan would say to those who have 20 percent of the \nhighest incomes in America, you should smile because you are going to \nreceive 80 percent of the benefit of our tax cuts.\n  A curious economic program, one that when the American people got \nonto it they did not like very much. And so the 104th Congress which \nstarted with almost a coronation is now kind of limping to a conclusion \nwith the folks who were so anxious to get here now wanting to leave.\n  I was reading last evening again a book that was written by a \ncolleague of ours, Senator Byrd from West Virginia, a book that is \ncompilations of some presentations he has made in this Chamber. And in \npart of the book he is discussing the old Roman Senate and a lot of \nhistorical references in the book that are quite interesting, one of \nthem about Hannibal which I mentioned to our caucus the other day, \nHannibal crossing the Alps. All of us studied in school about Hannibal. \nWhat a remarkable achievement. This man took, I believe, 36 elephants \nand crossed the Alps with these elephants, and, of course, that is what \nwe read about in our history books--Hannibal crossed the Alps with his \nelephants. Quite remarkable.\n  Hannibal, in fact, was quite a masterful tactician and strategist and \nhad quite an interesting record as a commander, military strategist. \nBut what you do not remember and what Senator Byrd described in his \nbook is the end stage of Hannibal. Hannibal lost an eye. All but one of \nhis elephants died, of course. There was one remaining emaciated \nelephant, and the last vision as I read last evening in the book is of \nthis one-eyed Carthaginian soldier named Hannibal riding the last of \nhis emaciated elephants across the plains of Italy. I thought to \nmyself, you know, that reminds me a little bit of the way the 104th \nCongress is ending up--the last emaciated elephant being ridden across \nthe plains of Italy.\n  We have a responsibility in Congress to do what the people expect us \nto do on behalf of this country, and I think this Congress has done \nsome things that are commendable but we have not nearly scratched the \nsurface on the menu of things that most people would want us to deal \nwith.\n  Education. How do we move our country in a direction that assures us \nwe are going to have the best education system in the world? That ought \nto be our country's goal. In every corner of America it ought to be our \ngoal to build our education system that is the finest in the world.\n  Jobs. Our goal ought to be to find a way to provide more economic \ngrowth, an expanded economy, a trade balance that is not in deep \ndeficit but one that is in reasonable balance with jobs staying here, \nnot moving overseas.\n  Crime. Dealing with the epidemic of crime in America in a thoughtful \nway, a manner in which maybe both parties would agree dealing with the \nepidemic of violent crime is in the interest of all Americans.\n  And the environment. In 20 years we have doubled the use of energy in \nAmerica, and at the end of 20 years doubling the use of energy we have \ncleaner air and cleaner water. No one 20 years ago would have predicted \nthat possible. Improving on that record as well.\n  Mr. President, I see my colleague from Mississippi, the majority \nleader, Senator Lott, is here to make unanimous-consent requests.

I thank the Senator from North Dakota.\n  I know he is going to be staying so we can go through these consent \nrequests that we have. I would like to begin, Mr. President, by asking \nunanimous consent that when the Senate receives from the House a joint \nresolution making continuing appropriations for fiscal year 1997, the \njoint resolution be placed on the calendar and the Senate proceed to \nconsider the joint resolution on Tuesday, September 24, or any day \nthereafter after consultation with the Democratic leader and it be \nconsidered under the following agreement: 1 hour equally divided on the \njoint resolution, third reading and adoption of the joint resolution \noccurring no later than 9 p.m. Wednesday, September 25.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection----\n  Mr. DORGAN. Reserving the right to object--Mr. President, reserving \nthe right to object----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. DORGAN. Reserving the right to object----\n  Mr. LOTT. I thought the Chair did a very good job.\n  Mr. DORGAN.--And I shall object, I would observe this is one of the \nfastest Presiding Officers I have seen in some while in the Senate.\n  Mr. LOTT. I was just commending him.\n  Mr. DORGAN. As I understand the Senator from Mississippi, he suggests \nwe agree to a piece of legislation not\n\n[[Page S11109]]\n\nyet written, agree to offer no amendments to a bill, the provisions of \nwhich we are not yet sure might or might not need amending, and agree \nto it at a time not yet certain. Is that the sum and substance of the \nproposal?\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, if I could comment on that, I would like to \nbegin by reminding my colleagues that one week from Monday, this coming \nMonday, is the end of the fiscal year. We have a job to do. We are \nworking with the administration and with the appropriators on both \nsides of the aisle to get agreement on numbers and on language that \nwould go in a bill that would be necessary to keep all of the various \ndepartments working, assuming we cannot get all the appropriations \nbills completed in advance of that date. And it appears we will not, \nalthough work is still being done on some of them.\n  I believe the VA-HUD appropriations bill, for instance, will be \nready. Everybody understands and expects that Labor-HHS and Education, \nCommerce-Justice-State Department, and Interior and probably Treasury-\nPostal, at least those four would be in a continuing resolution.\n  Having said that, with that deadline, the end of the fiscal year is \none week from Monday. This coming Monday is a Jewish holiday. That \nleaves Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday, Monday, \nand the fiscal year is over.\n  We can stand around and wait for chaos and we will create it. We need \na safety net under our military men and women and for our people that \nhave had fires and disasters and for our children and our schools. We \nneed to make sure that safety net is there and in place through a \ncontinuing resolution. In order to get that done, we have to get \nstarted.\n  I have offered to the leadership in the Senate, Senator Daschle in \nparticular, the Democratic leader, and have communicated these various \nideas to a number of Senators, the appropriations chairmen, ranking \nMembers in the House, a number of options how we could do this. Senator \nDaschle and I have spent a lot of time talking it through. I think he \nwants us to find a way to do it, but the problem is we have to do it. \nWe have to find a way to do it. So I suggested that we would call the \nCR up and we will have available on Tuesday the basis of the CR that we \ncould go forward with. The committees are coming to closure now. CJS--\nCommerce, Justice, State--I think they are about ready. Interior is \nmaking good progress. We are going to have it by Tuesday.\n\n  So I said to Senator Daschle, why don't we call this up on Tuesday \nand let us get an agreement that we will have 6 amendments in order on \neach side, a total of 12 amendments, but that we would complete the \ndebate on amendments and pass it by Wednesday night.\n  He had some concerns about that. He said, I don't know about trying \nto limit it to six. Of course, we would all have to try to find some \nway of agreeing on our side and your side what the six would be, and \nthat would probably befall your lot to try to help your side.\n  He was not comfortable with that. I said how about plan B. Let's \nbegin Tuesday. Let's not have any limit on amendments, any limit on \ntime. Let's get started. We offer an amendment; you offer an amendment, \nsecond degrees, sort of a jungle route, no limitations. Let's get \nstarted. Let's finish our work. But we would finish it Wednesday night \nat 9 o'clock.\n  I think Senator Daschle would like to do that but apparently there \nwas an objection on that side. I do not quite understand why.\n  Another option is that we bring this over attached to the Department \nof Defense appropriations bill. To be perfectly honest, there are some \npotential problems with that.\n  But, I mean, remember now, we are proceeding on the assumption that \nwe are going to be basically in agreement. Basically, on numbers and \nlanguage, we are coming together, and we think we are going to get an \nagreement. The problem is, how do we, mechanically, get it done?\n  What is magic about 9 o'clock Wednesday night? Once we do our work \nhere in the Senate on that, on the CR, and get it done Wednesday night, \nthen it has to go to conference. It will take, I am sure--no matter \nwhat happens, there is going to be a little difference between the \nHouse and the Senate. That has to go to conference. Should we not give \nthem at least a day, Thursday, maybe until Friday morning, to get the \nconference agreement?\n  Then we would have to take the conference agreement up Friday \nafternoon or Saturday or Sunday. In order to get our work done, we \nwould have to complete it, I presume, sometime Friday night or Saturday \nso it could go to the President and he could sign it, and, you know, \neverything would be under control.\n  If we do not get started Tuesday, if we do not complete it Wednesday, \nwhen does it go to conference? Does it go to conference Thursday? Are \nthey going to take all day Friday? Are they going to be in conference \nover the weekend? Are we going to, then, go home 3 days before the end \nof the fiscal year and see our constituents while we are on the verge \nof running out of time on the fiscal year? I am not sure that is smart.\n  So here is what I am trying to say. I am flexible. I will work with \nyou. Give me an idea. But I want to make it abundantly clear that, as \nmajority leader, I am committed to getting this work done and that I am \noffering multiple avenues to get there to the Democratic leadership. \nBut at some point we are going to have to get an agreement.\n  So, I just wanted to go through that. If this is not an acceptable \narrangement, we need some kind of an agreement. I thought this was a \ngood one to get started, that there be some time, equally divided time; \nwe have amendments that could be offered. But there is going to be \nobjection. We are going to get started on Tuesday morning--Tuesday--on \nthis issue. We will just go forward. If we cannot get it done \nWednesday, maybe we will get it done Thursday. But I want to make it \nclear to the American people that I am worried about making sure we \nhave a safety net under our people so that we do not get into this game \nat the end of trying to squeeze one last drop of additional spending \nout of the Federal Government and have a potential problem next Monday \nat the end of the fiscal year.\n  So, I am agreeable to work with the Democratic leadership, but this \nis a way to get it started, and that is why I made the request.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, continuing the reservation to object, and \nI shall object here, the Senator from Mississippi, of course, knew that \nthere is not an agreement here and that we are constrained to object at \nthis moment. I might say that the House of Representatives indicates to \nour appropriations staff that they intend to be going to the Rules \nCommittee on Thursday and taking up the bill on Friday. And you are \nproposing a unanimous-consent request that we bring up a House product \nthat apparently is not going to be done until Friday on the floor of \nthe Senate on Tuesday.\n  Mr. LOTT. Will the Senator yield on that point?\n  Mr. DORGAN. I will be happy to yield.\n  Mr. LOTT. I just double checked on that. They will have a document \nready on Tuesday, and my information is they will be done with this by \nWednesday. Maybe just physically it may be later, but there is nothing \nrare about the Senate going ahead and getting started, provided we do \nnot complete it before they do their work. But we can do a lot of work \nwhile they are working and complete it after they finish.\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. I understand. But my point is, we do not have any \nintention of delaying. By the same token, a unanimous-consent request \nthat says, ``By the way, let us take something that is not yet created \nand agree to bring it up on Tuesday at a point when it won't be done,'' \nsuggests that none of us will be able to offer any amendments to what \nlikely will be an enormously bloated product, not necessarily with \nthings that will get vetoed, but with things that those in a position \nto stick them in do stick into this particular piece of legislation.\n  So we want to work with the majority leader. I think Senator Daschle \nand you have talked a great deal on this. We have no interest in \ndelaying the business of the Senate. By the same token, we have no \ninterest in agreeing to a process that will not allow an opportunity to \namend circumstances in this piece of legislation that may well cry out \nfor amendment.\n\n[[Page S11110]]\n\n  So I am constrained to object to the unanimous-consent request the \nSenator is now offering.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The text of the amendment is printed in today's Record under \n``Amendments Submitted.'')\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, community and migrant health centers play \na vital role in bringing affordable and accessible community-based \nprimary care to millions of Americans in underserved areas. Since its \nbeginning in 1966, the Community Health Center Program has been the \nbackbone of Federal efforts to bring quality health care to needy \npersons and areas throughout the country. In inner cities and isolated \nrural areas, these health centers have served millions of uninsured and \nunderinsured people, including the elderly, women and children at risk, \nand those with other special needs. Nationwide, over 2,400 health \ncenters provide basic services to over 9 million persons a year.\n  In addition to basic care, these centers provide many other services, \nincluding health education, public health screening, laboratory \nservices, preventive dental care, emergency care, pharmacy services, \nsubstance abuse counseling, and social services. Many centers maintain \nextended hours for working families. They offer care at multiple sites, \nand use mobile clinics to reach rural patients. They employ \nmultilingual staff to reduce barriers to care. They stay in touch with \ncommunity needs by working closely with local groups.\n  A key feature of the health centers is their strong emphasis on \npreventive care. For the high risk populations they serve, the centers \nreduce the demand for costly emergency and in-patient hospital care by \nemphasizing prevention, early intervention, and case management with \ngood followup. One of the many vital missions of the centers is to \nreduce infant mortality and low birthweight, by reaching out and \nhelping pregnant women and their infants receive timely care.\n  In Massachusetts, these health centers provide vital services to \ncommunities across the State. Over 800,000 persons receive primary and \npreventive health care through the centers. This care would otherwise \nbe delayed or unavailable for those without access to other assistance. \nIn western Massachusetts, health centers have mobilized to address \ncomplex problems such as high teenage birth rates, increasing rates of \nHIV infection, and the high incidence of drug abuse and alcohol-related \nproblems. In areas hard hit by the recent recession, the centers \nprovide a real opportunity for uninsured and struggling families to \nreceive comprehensive care.\n  Community health centers are becoming even more important as the \nnumber of people who lack insurance continues to rise. Every year, \napproximately 1 million more individuals, most of them children, lose \ntheir insurance coverage. Today, over 41 million Americans are \nuninsured. Current projections estimate that the number will reach 50 \nmillion by the year 2000.\n  Medicare and Medicaid, together with grants under this program, make \nup almost 75 percent of the revenues that support these centers. \nReductions in this support would mean serious financial difficulty for \nall community health centers.\n  The centers already face a changing health landscape that brings with \nit both opportunities and threats to the future viability of the \ncenters. Some centers are responding creatively, but others are having \ngreat difficulty. In particular, the trend toward managed care raises \nserious concerns about the ability of these health centers to continue \nto provide their communities with high quality, cost-effective \npreventive care and primary care services. Several provisions in this \nbill are designed to strengthen the centers and help them compete in \nthe changing marketplace.\n\n  The Health Centers Consolidation Act consolidates and reauthorizes \nthe four health center programs--the Community Health Center Program, \nthe Migrant Health Center Program, the Health Services for the Homeless \nProgram, and the Health Services for Residents of Public Housing \nProgram. Consolidating these programs will eliminate duplication while \nmaintaining their unique features that have made them so effective.\n  In addition, the bill helps health centers to address one of the \nbiggest problems they face--obtaining funds to develop and operate \ntheir own managed\n\n[[Page S11115]]\n\ncare networks or plans. Testimony before the Senate Labor and Human \nResources Committee concluded that participation in such networks was \nvital to the future of the program, as States move more rapidly to \nplace their Medicaid population into managed care.\n  Health centers need to be able to form networks and managed care \nplans to serve their patients effectively. But since centers are public \nor nonprofit corporations, they have limited revenues and relatively \nfew assets. As a result, they are often unable to secure loans, \nespecially for the purpose of establishing risk reserves.\n  The bill addresses this problem in two ways, by network planning \ngrants and a Federal loan guarantee program. The grants will help \ncenters begin the initial phase of setting up links with other health \nfacilities and health providers. The loan guarantee program will enable \ncenters to take the next steps in owning and operating a network by \nleveraging private dollars to help cover the developmental and initial \noperating costs, which can range up to several million dollars.\n  The loan guarantee for network development establishes a program to \nguarantee the principal and interest on loans made by non-Federal \nlenders to health centers for the costs of developing and operating \nmanaged care networks. The guarantees are subject to all of the \nrequirements of the 1990 Federal Credit Reform Act. The Congressional \nBudget Office has estimated a 10-percent subsidy rate for the loan \nprogram, which means that every dollar guaranteed by the Federal \nGovernment would support $10 in loans to health centers.\n  Loans secured through the loan guarantee fund will be used for \nactivities needed to develop networks, such as establishing risk \nreserves, acquiring or leasing buildings and equipment, and purchasing \nmanagement information systems. The cost of the program to the Federal \nGovernment will be offset by loan origination fees.\n  This legislation recognizes the need to concentrate grant funds on \nhealth services. The bill authorizes the Secretary of HHS to award \ngrants to pay for the costs associated with construction of new \nbuildings or the renovation of existing buildings--but only if the \nprojects are approved prior to October 1, 1996. Such approved projects \nmust be undertaken pursuant to the statutory and contractual terms, \nconditions, and assurances in effect at the time Federal assistance for \nthe project was approved by the Secretary, even though the actual grant \nwill not be award until after October 1, 1996.\n  Because of the need to concentrate limited grant funds on providing \nservices, health centers need more flexibility in the use of their \nnongrant funds. This bill enhances local health center decisionmaking \nin the use of non-Federal grant revenues, thereby strengthening the \nability of health centers to respond to the changing environment and \ncompete more effectively as businesses in the health marketplace.\n  Through the leadership of Senator Kassebaum, this bill helps rural \nhealth centers remove many of the barriers to health care in rural \nAmerica by authorizing grants for Rural Health Outreach, Network \nDevelopment, and Telemedicine. These grant funds will enable rural \nhealth centers to improve the quality of essential health care \nservices.\n  In sum, this legislation is a significant step toward enabling local \nhealth centers to compete and thrive in the changing health \nmarketplace. The centers are providing quality health care to needy \npersons and areas throughout the country, and their ability to do so \nwill be preserved and strengthened by this important bipartisan \nlegislation. I urge the Senate to approve it.\n\n\n                           Rural Primary Care\n\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, as Senator Kassebaum knows, many areas of \nWyoming, Kansas, and other rural States in the Midwest and West suffer \nfrom severe shortages of primary care providers and services. I \nappreciate the opportunity to work with you on S. 1044, legislation \nreauthorizing the community health center program, to ensure that this \nprogram is a viable option for rural communities in the Midwest and \nWest.\n  One solution that will help preserve and strengthen access to primary \ncare services in rural areas is a change in the governing board \ncriteria for the health centers. For a number of reasons related to \nsuch factors as geography and population density, rural hospitals and \nother rural providers have had difficulty qualifying for the community \nhealth center program because they cannot meet all of the program's \nstrict governing board requirements. It is my understanding that the \nlegislation we are considering today requires the Secretary of Health \nand Human Services to waive some or all of these requirements if rural \nproviders can show that it is not feasible or practicable for them to \nmeet the requirements. This will certainly make it easier for rural \nhospitals and other rural providers who would otherwise qualify to \nparticipate in the program.\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM. The Senator is correct. Following up on your \nsuggestion, S. 1044 provides the Secretary with this waiver authority. \nThe bill has been modified to ensure that this waiver will be in effect \nfor the length of the community health center grant. Rural providers \nwill not be required to repeatedly make their case to the Secretary \nover the period of the grant. It is also the committee's intention that \nthe process for obtaining this waiver be simple, straightforward, and \nshort. Our rural providers, who are already stretched so thinly, should \nnot be forced to go through a time-consuming, resource-consuming \npaperwork exercise to obtain a waiver.\n  Mr. THOMAS. I am also pleased that S. 1044 includes a provision \nrequiring the Secretary to give special consideration to the unique \nneeds of sparsely populated rural areas and to give priority to such \nareas in the awarding of health center planning and operating grants. \nThese provisions will give greater weight in the awarding of grants to \nsuch factors as the severe shortages of primary care providers and \ngeographic barriers inhibiting access to care that are characteristic \nof many areas in the Midwest and West.\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM. I would also note that S. 1044 continues an authority \nin current law that permits the Secretary to designate a population as \n``medically underserved'' if the chief executive officer of a State and \nlocal officials recommend that designation based on unusual local \nconditions which are a barrier to access to care. I would hope that \nthis authority will also be used to address the unique needs of \nsparsely populated rural areas.\n  I also wanted to assure the Senator from Wyoming that this bill \nincorporates your suggestion for improving the coordination of services \nin rural communities through collaborative relationships between \ncommunity health centers and other rural providers in the center's \nservice area. As a condition of eligibility for a health center \nplanning or operating grant, the center must demonstrate its efforts to \ndevelop and maintain such relationships.\n\n\n                      Sections 329, 330, 340, 340A\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. The Health Centers Consolidation Act goes a long way in \nmaking many improvements to the health center program. One of these \nimportant improvements is to consolidate and streamline sections 329, \n330, 340 and 340A of the Public Health Service Act. What remains clear \nis that all centers under the new, consolidated section 330(a) will \nhave to continue to provide required primary health services to all \nresidents in the health center's service area. Consistent with the \nhistory of these centers, that means the centers provide the health \nservices regardless of an individual's ability to pay.\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM. Mr. President, I agree, that requirement goes to the \nfundamental nature and purpose of these important safety net providers. \nAll of the health centers must serve all residents of the area served \nby the center, regardless of an individual's ability to pay for the \nservices they receive.\n\n\n                       publication of guidelines\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. As part of the loan guarantee program authorized under \nS. 1044, we are requiring the Secretary of Health and Human Services to \npublish guidance explaining how the requirements and other provisions \nof the loan guarantee program will be administered. It is normal for \nagencies to put out guidance to the universe of affected entities, \nincluding health centers, primary care associations, and other entities \nwith which the agency has cooperative agreements when funding is \navailable to them. The guidance includes things such as what is \nrequired\n\n[[Page S11116]]\n\nin the application, the criteria that will be used to evaluate the \napplication, and documentation that will be required if the funding is \nto be granted, or, in this case, a loan guaranteed for health center \nnetworks or plans.\n  The requirement to publish guidance is not intended to delay the \nimplementaton of the loan guarantee program, and the distribution of \nthe guidance to the appropriate committees of Congress is meant for \ninformational purposes. It is my understanding that the Committee does \nnot intend that the publication of guidance required under S. 1044 to \nbe subject to the provisions of the Administrative Procedures Act.\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM. That is correct. I understand how important the loan \nguarantee provisions of S. 1044 are to the health centers. The States \nare rapidly moving to managed care systems for Medicaid recipients. In \norder to continue serving these individuals and other low-income, \nuninsured individuals, centers must have the ability to form viable, \ncompetitive networks and plans. The loan guarantee program will benefit \ncenters across the country, including rural centers who are now trying \nto position themselves for the movement of managed care into rural \nareas.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in \nthe Record a summary of S. 1044 and the manager's amendment.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\nSummary of S. 1044, the Health Centers Consolidation Act and the Floor \n           Manager's Amendment in the Nature of a Substitute\n\n\n                         i. summary of s. 1044\n\n       S. 1044, reported unanimously by the Senate Committee on \n     Labor and Human Resources on July 20, 1995, consolidates and \n     streamlines four separate Public Health Service Act (PHSA) \n     programs under one authority, a rewritten section 330 of the \n     PHSA. The consolidated programs are the Migrant Health Center \n     program (section 329 of the PHSA), the Community Health \n     Center program (section 330 of the PHSA), the Health Care for \n     the Homeless program (section 340 of the PHSA), and the \n     Health Services for Residents of Public Housing program \n     (section 340A of the PHSA). For these consolidated programs, \n     S. 1044 authorizes $756.518 million in fiscal year 1996 and \n     ``such sums'' for fiscal years 1997 through 2000.\n       In addition, the bill formally authorizes as new section \n     330A of the Public Health Service Act the ``Rural Health \n     Outreach, Network Development, and Telemedicine Grant'' \n     program. This program consolidates and reforms several \n     currently funded, discretionary rural health programs. This \n     program is authorized at $36 million in fiscal year 1996 \n     (current spending) and at ``such sums'' for fiscal years 1997 \n     through 2000.\n\n\n                 ii. summary of the manager's amendment\n\n       The manager's amendment makes a number of technical \n     corrections to S. 1044 as reported. In addition, it makes \n     several policy changes:\n     A. Loan guarantee program\n       It replaces the Secretary's authority under S. 1044 to \n     provide grants for facility construction and modernization \n     with a loan guarantee fund to provide health centers with the \n     ability to leverage private-sector resources for the \n     development and initial operation of health networks and \n     plans. This permits federal dollars to be focused on the \n     provision of services, rather than on ``bricks and mortar.''\n     B. Changes in authorization period and authorization level\n       Reflecting the fact that fiscal year 1996 is nearly at an \n     end, the manager's amendment updates the authorization period \n     from fiscal years 1996 through 2000 to fiscal years 1997 \n     through 2001. Reflecting the appropriation provided for the \n     health center programs in the House-passed appropriations \n     bill, the manager's amendment updates the funding level to \n     $802.124 million in fiscal year 1997 and ``such sums'' in the \n     out years.\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the amendment be \nagreed to, the bill be deemed read a third time and passed, as amended, \nthe motion to reconsider be laid upon the table, and that any \nstatements relating to the bill appear at this point in the Record. I \nhave some statements for the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment (No. 5397) was agreed to.\n  The bill (S. 1044), as amended, was deemed read a third time and \npassed, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1044\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

I ask the Senator whether any of the unanimous consent \nrequests he is intending to propound would include the clearing of any \njudgeships. If so, we would certainly be favorably disposed to not \nobject to that. If not, I am wondering if just in this moment I might \nlearn whether we would have an opportunity to clear any additional \njudges that are now waiting clearance?\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I do not believe there are any judges on \nthis list that have been cleared tonight. There is--hope springs \neternal. I know the Judiciary Committee had a meeting this week. There \nwas some discussion about some of the judges that are pending. I \nbelieve there are only six judges that are on the calendar before the \nSenate at this time, four circuit judges and two district judges.\n  None of those have been cleared through the process at this point.\n  Mr. DORGAN. If the Senator will further yield, I want to make the \npoint there are 22 additional judges awaiting action by the Judiciary \nCommittee. I heard from some that there is no intention of clearing \nadditional judges. My hope is that would not be the case.\n  I wonder if the Senator expects we might be clearing additional \njudges?\n  Mr. LOTT. I am not on the Judiciary Committee. I have discussed it \nwith the chairman and other members of the committee. I don't think any \ndecision has been made yet on whether or not they might report some \nmore. I know they are looking at some of them. I will note 4 years ago \nat this time, I believe there were 50 Federal judges that had been \nnominated that were left either in the committee or on the Calendar.\n  Numberwise, I think we are probably in much better shape than the \nsituation was 4 years ago. And I must say, I am pleased that I was able \nto work with Members on both sides of the aisle in July, for the most \npart, and early August. We cleared 17 judges, some of whom had been \npending on the Calendar for 6 or 7 months--17 out of 23.\n  So we did pretty good work. Some of them were controversial, and it \ntook more than one try. In fact, I think I tried 3 times on a block of \n9 judges, but we did get 17 of them done. I thought that was good \nprogress.\n  Mr. DORGAN. If I might, Mr. President, with the consent of the \nSenator from Mississippi, observe, he deserves\n\n[[Page S11122]]\n\ncommendation for getting some of these judgeships moving. He did work \non them very hard. I will just say, I don't think we have done as well \nas we did 2 years ago. It is true, 50 were left, but we cleared far \nmore 2 years ago, 4 years ago, 6 years ago. The reason so many were \nleft is they were submitted late.\n  The fact is, I don't think we have done as good a job as I think we \nshould for the Judiciary. We tried hard not only to get a CR passed but \nalso clear some of these judges on the Calendar, as well as those \nawaiting action by the Judiciary Committee. I appreciate the Senator \nyielding.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/20/senate-section/article/S11121-1", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "20", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11122-S11123]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n       FEDERAL LAW ENFORCEMENT DEPENDENTS ASSISTANCE ACT OF 1996\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to the consideration of S. 2101, introduced earlier today by \nSenator Specter, for himself and others.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 2101) to provide educational assistance to the \n     dependents of Federal law enforcement officials who are \n     killed or disabled in the performance of their duties.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the immediate \nconsideration of the bill?\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I have sought recognition to comment on \nlegislation which the Senate is considering today, the Federal Law \nEnforcement Dependents Assistance Act of 1996. This bipartisan \nlegislation is a revised version of S. 1243, which I introduced with \nfour cosponsors on September 14, 1995.\n  This legislation will provide educational assistance to spouses and \nchildren of Federal law enforcement officers who are killed or totally \nand permanently disabled in the line of duty. Similar educational \nbenefits are provided to the spouses and children of Armed Forces \npersonnel killed in the line of duty, but not to dependents of the \nbrave men and women in Federal law enforcement. I am advised that many \nState and local governments provide educational and job training \nassistance to dependents of law enforcement personnel. It is time to \nlevel the playing field for Federal law enforcement.\n  I first became aware of this discrepancy when I met with Mrs. Karen \nDegan, the widow of U.S. Marshal Bill Degan of Quincy, MA, who died \nduring the tragic shooting incident at Ruby Ridge in August, 1992. Bill \nDegan left behind a loving wife and two sons, William and Brian, whom I \nhave also had the pleasure of meeting. Bill Degan had been in the \nMarshals Service for 17 years at the time of his death. Karen Degan \nbegan in 1993 to work with Congress to develop a program for higher \neducation assistance for dependents of slain Justice Department \nofficers. At her suggestion, I introduced S. 1243 on September 14, \n1995, during the Ruby Ridge hearings, with bipartisan cosponsors from \nthe Judiciary Committee.\n  I would prefer that we did not have to worry about death and \ndisabling injuries for Federal law enforcement officers, but it is a \nfact of life that we have lost a number of Federal law enforcement \nofficers in the line of duty in recent years. In my own State of \nPennsylvania, on March 22, 1996, FBI Special Agent Charles Reed was \nkilled in Philadelphia in a shootout with a suspect drug dealer during \nan undercover drug investigation. Agent Reed lived in Lower Salford \nTownship, PA and is survived by his wife, Susan and children, Joshua, \nage 21, Todd 18, and Kelley, 17. Similarly, two Washington, DC FBI \nagents, Martha Martinez and Michael Miller, were slain in November \n1995, in the Washington, DC police headquarters, leaving behind loved \nones of their own.\n  Since the introduction of S. 1243 last year, I have been working with \nmy colleagues and the administration to fashion legislation acceptable \nto all parties. This revised bill makes the educational assistance \navailable to all Federal law enforcement officers, not just those \nwithin the Justice Department. I would note that the program is subject \nto appropriations and does not constitute an entitlement. Financial \nassistance can last for up to 45 months of education or a proportional \nperiod of time for a part-time program. Financial assistance will be \nbased on the amounts provided under the Veterans program, which is \ncurrently $404 a month for fulltime students. Significantly, the \nAttorney General may provide retroactive assistance to dependents \neligible under this program where a law enforcement officer was killed \nin the line of duty on or after May 1, 1992.\n  This legislation is supported by the Federal Law Enforcement Officers \nAssociation, and I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \na letter to me from Victor Oboyski, dated September 18, 1996, which \nreflects their views.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                           Federal Law Enforcement\n\n\n                                         Officers Association,\n\n                                               September 18, 1996.\n     Hon. Arlen Specter,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Specter: On behalf of the over 12,000 members \n     of the Federal Law Enforcement Officers Association (FLEOA), \n     the largest association representing Federal criminal \n     investigators in the nation, I am pleased to inform you that \n     we fully support S. 1243, the ``Federal Law Enforcement \n     Dependents Assistance Act of 1996.'' I also want to thank you \n     for proposing this fine piece of legislation.\n       As you may already know, many state and local \n     municipalities currently have legislation which ensures that \n     the dependents of local officers killed or disabled in the \n     line of duty receive assistance towards education or job \n     training. Also, many local police agencies provide for the \n     continuing education of survivors under the same \n     circumstances. None of this exists at the Federal level. S. \n     1234 will correct this oversight regarding Federal law \n     enforcement officers.\n       If you or your staff wish to contact me please call 212-\n     637-6543, fax 212-637-6548.\n           Very truly yours,\n                                                   Victor Oboyski,\n                                               National President.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I rise as a cosponsor of the Federal Law \nEnforcement Dependents Assistance Act and to call on all of my Senate \ncolleagues to support this bill.\n  Unfortunately, over the past 2 years, many in this Congress have \ntaken the occasion--time and again--to second-guess and criticize law \nenforcement officers. We heard these criticisms throughout the debate \non terrorism legislation--beginning last year, and it continues to this \nday. As I have pointed out on the floor of the Senate before, I call on \nus all to remember that it is the terrorists and the violent criminals \nwho deserve our contempt and it is law enforcement officers who deserve \nour trust and respect.\n  This bill offers modest recognition of the tremendous service to our \nNation by Federal law enforcement officers--DEA agents, FBI agents, \nU.S. marshals, border patrol officers, Customs officers, ATF agents, \nSecret Service agents among many others. This bill does so by \nauthorizing the Federal Government to pay education benefits to the \nchildren and spouses of Federal law enforcement officers who are killed \nor suffer a total and permanent disability in the line of duty.\n  In doing so, this bill recognizes that by virtue of these officers \nsupreme sacrifice to the Nation, the families of these fallen officers \nare no longer provided for. And, more importantly, this bill will offer \na tangible sign of the Nation's respect for those who gave their lives \nin service to us all.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this bill, and I also want to put my \ncolleagues on notice that in the years ahead we must follow up by \nactually appropriating the dollars necessary to deliver on today's \ncommitment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the bill be \ndeemed read a third time, passed, the motion to reconsider be laid upon \nthe table, and any statements relating to the bill appear at the \nappropriate place in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The bill (S. 2101) was deemed read the third time and passed, as \nfollows:\n\n                                S. 2101\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Federal Law Enforcement \n     Dependents Assistance Act of 1996''.\n\n[[Page S11123]]\n\n     SEC. 2.
