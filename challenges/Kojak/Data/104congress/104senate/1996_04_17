Mr. President, if there is 1 day that dramatically \nhighlights the growing anxieties of middle-class Americans, it is April \n15. During this tax week of 1996, I want to share some thoughts on \ntaxes, Congress, and a certain word that has crept into a place of \nprominence here on Capitol Hill.\n  Since the opening days of the 104th Congress, my colleagues on the \nother side of the aisle have come to the floor repeatedly to talk of \n``extremism'' and ``extremists.''\n  These are not words to be tossed around lightly, and yet more than \n100 times over the past 16 months, those are the very words they have \nused to describe the work of this Congress. ``Extremist'' has become \nthe mantra of the minority, repeated over and over when all the \narguments have been exhausted and refuted, and name calling is all that \nremains.\n  The Contract With America ``is simply the wish list of the extreme \nfaction of one political party,'' says one.\n  ``The sweeping and extremist approach in this bill poses a grave \nthreat to all Americans, especially children,'' says another.\n  And finally, ``If moderation does not prevail, this level of \nextremism will ultimately take our country backward, not forward, and \nthe damage will be felt not by us, but by generations to come.''\n  Of course, the rhetoric has not been confined to this Chamber alone, \nor to the other body. The Clinton administration, and particularly the \nPresident and Vice President, have repeatedly engaged in it as well, as \nthey recite from the pages of this well-worn script. In just seven news \nconferences and speeches last year, Vice President Gore used some \nversion of the word ``extremist'' 22 times in describing our efforts to \nreform the way Government undertakes the people's business.\n  ``Extremist groups.''\n  ``Extremist measures.''\n  ``Extremist factions.''\n  ``The extremist, radical members of their caucus.''\n  ``An extremist set of priorities.''\n  ``An extremist agenda.''\n  You would think from all the dramatics that something truly horrible \nis going here. So, Mr. President, what's happening that has my Democrat \ncolleagues running so scared? What is Congress doing that is so \nradical, so dangerous, so wrong, so extreme?\n  Here are the shocking highlights:\n  We accomplished what a quarter century of Congresses couldn't when we \nbalanced the Federal budget. This Congress is not willing to let our \nchildren and grandchildren collapse under a load of debt that we have \ncreated.\n  We have taken responsible steps to control spending, reining in the \nFederal Government and reducing its role as the dominating force in \nAmerican life.\n  Working families would keep billions of their own money under the tax \nplan passed by Congress. We offered families a $500 tax credit for each \nchild, eliminated the marriage penalty that discriminated against \nmarried couples, and helped bring and keep families together through \nadoption and elderly care tax credits.\n\n  We are also not willing to sit by and let Medicare dissolve into \nbankruptcy. Under legislation passed by this Congress, seniors would be \nassured that Medicare--for some, their only link to health care \ninsurance--would be rescued from its impending insolvency.\n  Our plan to reform the welfare system encourages recipients to seek a \nlife beyond their monthly welfare checks, while it protects the \nAmerican taxpayers from the abuses of the past.\n  Mr. President, have my colleagues across the aisle become so \ninsulated from the public and isolated from reality that they have \nforgotten what qualifies as extreme out in the real world? Our work on \nbehalf of the Nation's families, taxpayers, senior citizens, children, \nand job providers could hardly be considered extreme. Far from it--what \nwe have accomplished is exactly what the American people sent us here \nto carry out.\n  So how do you think it makes them feel to see their dreams for the \nNation dismissed on the Senate floor as the notions of extremists?\n  If you really want to talk about extremism, there is a good reason \nwhy so many American families have April 15 circled on that calendar \ntaped to the refrigerator door. They have experienced extremism in \ntheir Government right where it hurts the most--the family wallet--and \nthey are reminded of that fact every year when tax day rolls around.\n  Under the current administration, Americans are paying more in \nFederal taxes this year than they have ever paid before.\n  President Clinton started the trend with his recordbreaking $241 \nbillion tax hike in 1993, which raised taxes on every member of the \nmiddle class. Add to that the new taxes imposed by the President in his \nlatest budget, and Americans will be paying a half trillion more in \ntaxes than we did before President Clinton took office. That is an \nadditional $758 every year, for the next 10 years, for every taxpayer \nin this country.\n  The American people say that is extreme.\n  The tax load has become such a burden that Tax Freedom Day--the day \nwe are no longer working just to pay our taxes and can begin keeping \nthat money for ourselves--will not arrive this year until May 7. That \nis the latest ever. It means working Americans have been on the job \nfrom January 1 through today, and have not been allowed to keep even a \ndime of their own money. That will not happen for another 20 days.\n  And by the way, families in my home State of Minnesota will have to \nwait even longer. Because State taxes in Minnesota are higher than the \nnational average, my constituents are forced to hold out an additional \n8 days until their Tax Freedom Day arrives.\n  And the calculations for Tax Freedom Day do not include the \nadditional days we are forced to work to cover the heavy costs of \nWashington's unnecessary and burdensome regulations as well. If it did, \nwe would not be marking our freedom until the first week of July. That \nis a cruel joke, considering that is when we are also celebrating \nIndependence Day.\n  The American people say that is extreme.\n\n[[Page S3419]]\n\n  When President Clinton was elected in 1992, Federal taxes on a \nmedian-income American family--Federal taxes on a median-income \nAmerican family--totaled $12,770. By last year, that same family was \npaying a total of $14,813 in taxes--over $2,000 a year more per median \nfamily since 1992. And now 26.5 percent of every family's income goes \ndirectly to Washington.\n  That is not exactly what the American people had in mind. In a survey \nconducted last year, they were asked what percentage of their income \nshould reasonably go to paying taxes. This was for all levels of \ngovernment, including social security taxes, sales taxes, excise taxes, \nand property taxes. Across the board, regardless of income group, age, \neducation, gender, race, or political affiliation, the answer was the \nsame: most people said a maximum tax burden of 25 percent would be \nfair.\n  No wonder they are feeling squeezed today. Far from the 25 percent \ntax rate they think is reasonable, the typical American family faced a \ntotal tax burden--and that includes Federal, State, and local taxes--of \n38.2 percent of all their income in 1995. That is more money going to \nWashington than families spend for food, clothing, shelter, and \ntransportation combined.\n  The American people say that is extreme, too.\n  I know that is what Minnesotans are saying. I held a series of town \nmeetings back home last week, in a part of the State where life can be \ntough and money doesn't come easy. It is home to hard-working people \nwho sometimes hold down two jobs, and spend as many as 7 days a week on \nthe job, struggling to stay afloat. They ask nothing more of their \nGovernment than the opportunity and freedom to make something of their \nlives. But high taxes continue to block the way.\n  We talked about taxes at every stop over the recess, and how 40 years \nof Washington's economic extremism have trapped working families short \nof their dreams.\n  They are frustrated. They do not see where their tax dollars are \ngoing, or how those dollars are directly improving their lives and \ntheir communities. And given that, they do not understand how Congress \ncan keep coming after them for more.\n  During one of our stops, a college student pulled me aside after my \ntown meeting in Duluth. He said, ``It seems like the federal government \nis reaching deeper and deeper into our pockets, but in my case, I don't \nhave any more to give.'' He went on to say, I don't qualify for student \naid, so I'm working for my tuition and rent. I'm paying all these \ntaxes, but none of it comes back to benefit me. So please--cut my taxes \nand let me keep my own money.''\n  People do not understand what is happening in Washington. The crowds \nat my town meetings wanted to know why the President campaigned on a \npromise to balance the budget and cut their taxes, but then vetoed the \nbalanced budget and tax relief bill passed by this Congress, and, by \nthe way, passed the largest tax increase on its own.\n  I had to admit that I did not understand either. ``Chalk it up to \nelection-year politics,'' I said.\n  Would the President come around and sign your bill this year, they \nwondered?\n  I had to say, ``It doesn't look good.'' ``Not this year. Not this \nPresident.'' And the people just shook their heads.\n  Listen to the people, Mr. President--they will tell you just what \nthey told me. Cutting taxes for working families is not extreme. \nPreserving Medicare is not extreme. Giving people opportunities to pull \nthemselves out of poverty is not extreme.\n  If anything is extreme about our government, it is the past practices \nof a Congress and President willing to steal from tomorrow's kids to \nfinance another Federal handout or social program or pork project \ntoday. That is what the people sent us here to change.\n  Mr. President, there are despicable people in this world--assassins, \nbombers, terrorists--who are filled with such rage and contempt that \nthey deserve to be branded as ``extremists.''\n  But in America, a man or woman who works themselves to the bone, who \nstruggles to put food on the table and keep a sturdy roof over their \nfamily's heads, who just wants to sign their tax return knowing that \nthis government does not take their tax dollars for granted anymore--is \nnot an extremist.\n  Yet, Mr. President, any time my colleagues dismiss the people's \ntaxpayers' agenda as extreme, they pin that label on every one of those \nAmericans.\n  During tax week, 1996, my colleagues would do well to acknowledge the \ndebt of gratitude we owe the American taxpayers. After all, their \nsacrifices have built this massive Federal Government. I leave you with \nthis question--during tax week, 1996, when Washington's burden has \nbecome too much and the people are begging for our help, what is this \nGovernment willing to sacrifice in return?\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, might I inquire, are we in morning \nbusiness?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate is in morning business.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/04/17/senate-section/article/S3418-3", "month": "04", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "17", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3419-S3420]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n      RETIREMENT OF UNIVERSITY OF MONTANA FOOTBALL COACH DON READ\n\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I rise today to echo what is probably on \nthe mind of everybody who ever attended school at the University of \nMontana, and every Grizzlies fan in my home State. Coach Don Read, the \nfootball coach of the last 10 or 11 years, is retiring. He told us all \nMonday that he was retiring in order to spend more time with his wife, \nLois, and the rest of the family, and to move in a new direction.\n  We are losing a legend in Missoula. We are saddened by that, even a \nlittle bit stunned, because Coach Read is the winningest coach in the \nhistory of the University of Montana. When he arrived in Missoula 10 \nyears ago, he recruited heavily, ushering in the ``Read Era'' of UM, an \nera that culminated in the university's first-ever Division One-double-\nA national championship just this past season. It was a thrilling ride \nfor every one of us in Montana, and we cannot help but think of what is \nahead for the Griz because of the foundation and the base that Coach \nRead has laid.\n  Mr. President, Vince Lombardi, the legendary coach of the Green Bay \nPackers, said ``winning is a habit.'' No one typified the winning habit \nmore than Coach Read. Since taking over the University of Montana \nfootball program in 1986, he has never had a losing season. His overall \nrecord there was 85 and 36. That is a winning average of better than 70 \npercent, the best any coach at UM and the sixth best in the history of \nthe Big Sky Conference.\n  In his tenure at the University of Montana, Coach Read even managed \nto pull off 10 straight wins against his cross-state rival and another \none of my favorite teams, Montana State University. His overall \ncoaching record including his many years coaching in Oregon is an \nimpressive 154 and 127 and one--he had one tie.\n  Mr. President, I could go on about all the ``firsts'' and \nthe ``mosts'' and the awards of Coach Read and what he has earned in \nhis time at the University of Montana. Most wins by a Griz football \nteam in a single season, five playoff appearances, three-time Big Sky \nCoach of the Year, selected Division One-double-A Coach of the Year by \ntwo national magazines, but all of that pales in comparison to Don Read \nas a man, and as a man that I know. He is loved and respected by his \nplayers and his colleagues and he is a fiercely devoted family man.\n\n  You know they say the coach will probably be judged on the wins and \nlosses. But basically, what effect he has had on the young men who have \nplayed on his team is just absolutely--you cannot measure that. By his \nown words, the demands of coaching is a 16-hour-a-day, 7-day-a-week \njob. It has a way of catching up with you. Coach Read wants to make \nsure that his players will have a full-time coach that devotes all of \nhis energy toward that team. In that respect, I admire him for putting \nthe needs of a team before his own.\n  So the University of Montana is really losing one of the great ones. \nWe want to thank him for the season just passed. The national \nchampionship is one that is not written about and is not voted on by \nsportswriters. It is played. Of course when you want it, he beat \nMarshall here in the State of West Virginia. It was a great thrill for \nall of us who live in the State of Montana.\n  Coach Read said he believes his replacement will be the best coach \never. I hope he is right. But I tell you he will be stepping into some \nawfully big\n\n[[Page S3420]]\n\nshoes. Just like anybody else, he will have to get his cleats the old-\nfashioned way. He will have to earn them. That is the way it will be.\n  Mr. President, we bid farewell to a man who has brought so much \nrespect and so much quality to the University of Montana and the \nfootball program, and we say goodbye, but we do not say so long.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/04/17/senate-section/article/S3419-1", "month": "04", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "17", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3420-S3421]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            PROGRESS TOWARD A BAN ON ANTIPERSONNEL LANDMINES\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I want to bring Senators up to date on the \nprogress of the past 2 months since the Leahy amendment for a \nmoratorium on the use of antipersonnel landmines was signed into law.\n  That amendment received bipartisan support from about two-thirds of \nthe Senate. It was supported by the House-Senate conference committee, \nand it was signed by the President on February 12. I want to thank all \nthose Senators who voted for it. I would also like to thank those \nSenators who have come up to me since the vote who did not vote for it \nand said now they wished they had because of the havoc that the mines \nhave wreaked in Bosnia.\n  In fact, in Bosnia just since December, 38 NATO soldiers have been \ninjured, 7 have been killed by landmines, including 3 Americans. There \nare 3 million landmines left in Bosnia. To put that in perspective, \nthere are 3 million landmines in a country about the size of Tennessee. \nThey will kill and maim civilians for decades after our troops leave. \nChildren going to school, farmers working in their fields, and people \ngoing to market will be dying long after most of us have left the U.S. \nSenate.\n  Over the past several years, I have sponsored legislation against \nantipersonnel landmines. The purpose of my legislation has been to \nexert United States leadership so that pressure would build on other \ncountries to follow our example. During a lot of that time this was \nseen as some kind of a crusade of civilians against the military. It \nwas never the case. It was never intended by me to be the case. In \nfact, one of the greatest encouragements I had in my efforts to ban \nlandmines was the support I received from combat veterans around this \ncountry.\n  Those who say we need antipersonnel landmines should read the April 3 \nfull-page open letter to President Clinton that appeared in the New \nYork Times. In this full-page letter to the President, 15 of the \ncountry's most distinguished retired military officers called for a ban \non the production, the sale, the transfer, and the use of antipersonnel \nlandmines. They say such a ban would be both ``humane and militarily \nresponsible.''\n  Look at some of the people who signed this. These are not just wild-\neyed theorists. They include Gen. Norman Schwarzkopf; former Chairman \nof the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Gen. David Jones; the former Supreme \nAllied Commander, Gen. John Galvin; former Commander in Chief of the \nU.S. Southern Command, Gen. Frederick Woerner; former Commmanding \nGeneral, U.S. Readiness Command, Gen. Volney Warner. Mr. President, \nthese are generals who know what has happened.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a copy of the generals' letter be \nprinted in the Record following my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. LEAHY. There is no doubt that antipersonnel landmines have some \nuse. Any weapon does. But to those who would argue that whatever use \nthey have outweighs the devastation they inflict on whole societies, I \nwould answer that the commanders of our forces in South Korea, Vietnam, \nNATO, and Desert Storm say otherwise.\n  They say we can get rid of these landmines. These generals have used \nantipersonnel landmines and have seen what they do. They say these \nindiscriminate weapons made their jobs more dangerous, not safer. They \nremember their troops being blown up by their own minefields.\n  Today, it is landmines that our troops fear the most in Bosnia. No \narmy is going to challenge our men and women in Bosnia, but there are \nhidden killers everywhere. A $2 antipersonnel mine will blow the leg \noff the best-trained, the best-equipped, the best-motivated American \nsoldier.\n  In the 2 months since February, Canada, the Netherlands, Australia \nand, yesterday, Germany, have announced they will unilaterally, \neffective immediately, ban their use of antipersonnel landmines. These \ncountries have gone way out ahead of the United States in showing \nleadership to ban landmines. Several, like Germany, said they will \ndestroy their stockpile of these weapons. They are taking this action, \nwhich far surpasses what the United States has done, to lead the rest \nof the world.\n  Mr. President, next Monday, the United States will join over 50 \ncountries in Geneva in the final session of negotiations on a treaty to \nlimit the use of antipersonnel landmines. We already know that any \nagreement is going to fall far short of what is needed to solve this \nproblem. Countries have insisted on exceptions and loopholes that are \njust going to assure that landmines will continue to maim and kill \ninnocent civilians for decades to come.\n  In the weeks of negotiations there have not been more than 2 minutes \nof discussion on the banning of these weapons--the simplest and easiest \nthing to do, and what all of these distinguished retired American \ngenerals asked us to do. The only way we are going to get rid of \nantipersonnel landmines is by leadership that energizes the rest of the \nworld.\n  A year and a half ago in a historic speech at the United Nations, \nPresident Clinton declared the goal of ridding the world of \nantipersonnel landmines.\n  There is no reason why today, with the world's attention focused on \nBosnia, where we are spending tens of millions of dollars just to try \nto find the mines, we cannot join with our NATO partners, who have gone \nway out ahead of the United States, and renounce these insidious \nweapons. Let the United States--the most powerful nation on Earth--\ninstead of being a follower in this, become the leader. A law we voted \nfor in the Senate, now on the books, says we will halt our use of these \nlandmines in 3 years. It should happen immediately, and it should be \npermanent, as Germany, Canada, and the others have done. Our senior \nretired combat officers support it. Hundreds of humanitarian \norganizations support it. They have seen the limbs torn off children at \nthe knee.\n  If I have anything to do with it--and I intend to--this country is \ngoing to end this century having banned these terrible weapons once and \nfor all. I hope the President and his administration will do what the \nUnited States Senate has already done--shown leadership in this. I hope \nthat the rest of the Congress will do that, and then I hope that the \nUnited States will come back into a leadership role in banning \nlandmines. It is what our NATO allies want, it is what our retired \ngenerals want, and it is what our men and women in the Armed Forces \nwant.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that an article in the April 8 \nedition of Newsweek magazine, by David Hackworth, America's most \ndecorated soldier, entitled, ``One Weapon We Don't Need,'' be printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                     [From Newsweek, Apr. 8, 1996]\n\n                        One Weapon We Don't Need\n\n                        (By David H. Hackworth)\n\n       Last February, Sgt. 1/C Donald A. Dugan was killed \n     instantly on a snowy patch of ground in Bosnia. An \n     antipersonnel mine exploded while the veteran U.S. Army \n     reconnaissance sergeant was attempting to disarm it. The \n     explosion drove a piece of the steel disarming tool into his \n     forehead. On a dozen different killing fields around the \n     world in the past 50 years. I've seen thousands of soldiers \n     and civilians blasted apart by land mines. In northern Italy, \n     where I served as a 15-year-old soldier boy at the end of \n     World War II, I saw an army captain's legs ripped off by a \n     land mine. In Bosnia last January, I came within minutes of \n     becoming a casualty myself from a land-mine explosion. But \n     I've never seen a battle in which land mines made a \n     difference to the outcome. They are ugly and ineffective \n     weapons, and they ought to be outlawed.\n       Land mines are indiscriminate killers. They kill not only \n     during the conflict, but decades after the last shot was \n     fired. The technology has improved; a modern mine can be \n     programmed to blow itself up after a few weeks or months, \n     reducing the postwar threat to civilians. But anti-personnel \n     mines are still not ``smart.'' They can't tell a good guy \n     from a bad guy, a soldier from a civilian, an adult from a \n     child. And some fail to blow themselves up. When millions of \n     mines are\n\n[[Page S3421]]\n\n     scattered across a battlefield by air and artillery, even a \n     tiny ``dud rate'' will leave a substantial number lying in \n     wait for innocent victims.\n       Of all the instruments of terror used on the battlefield, \n     mines are the most inhumane. The wartime casualties are young \n     men whose lives are either snuffed out or ruined forever by \n     crippling injuries. Even soldiers who escape from a minefield \n     unscathed are haunted by the experience. Many cases of \n     posttraumatic stress disorder, a serious psychological \n     malady, were caused by the preying fear of mines and booby \n     traps. Years later, a walk across an open field bring back \n     the old dread: What's under those leaves? Do I dare put my \n     foot on that freshly turned earth? Walk through a minefield, \n     and you'll never be young again.\n       During the Korean War, tens of thousands of soldiers on \n     both sides were felled by land mines. Many of them were \n     killed by their own mines, recklessly thrown down in haste, \n     their location unrecorded. In 1952, as a 21-year-old \n     lieutenant, I was ordered to clear a path through an unmapped \n     minefield--one of our own. I argued with my colonel about the \n     advisability of doing such work on frozen, snow-covered \n     ground. Lieutenants seldom win disputes with colonels, so the \n     mine-clearing detail proceeded as ordered until a fine black \n     sergeant named Simmons tripped the wire on a ``Bouncing \n     Betty'' mine. It popped up from the ground and blew off the \n     top of his head, covering me with his blood and brains. \n     Moments later, another noncom went nuts and stomped out \n     into the minefield, screaming: ``I'll find the f------ \n     mines, I'll find the f------ mines!'' He was tackled, \n     restrained and led away.\n       In Vietnam, the U.S. Armed Forces also used land mines \n     irresponsibly, dropping millions of them at random by air. \n     The enemy quickly learned how to disarm these weapons and \n     recycle them for use against us. The infantry battalion I \n     commanded in the Ninth Division took more than 1,800 \n     casualties in a year and a half, most of them caused by \n     recycled U.S. ordnance. Mines cannot secure a flank or defend \n     a position by themselves. For a minefield to be even \n     marginally effective, it must be protected by friendly \n     troops, to knock off the bad guys who want to clear a path or \n     use the mines against you.\n       Mines never stopped any unit of mine from taking its \n     objective--or the enemy from getting inside my wire. Anyone \n     who has ever been in battle, especially in Korea or Vietnam, \n     has seen enemy sappers crawl through mines and barbed wire \n     and get into their positions. I once faced a Chinese ``human \n     wave'' attack in Korea. My company was dug in on high ground, \n     with plenty of weapons, ammo and artillery support. Out in \n     front of our position we laid a carpet of mines and flares. \n     The enemy attacked in regimental strength, outnumbering us 9 \n     to 1. They walked through our minefield--and our gunfire--\n     without missing a beat. They cut my company in half and \n     within an hour were two miles to the south, in our rear. The \n     only way out was to move north, so we trudged through our own \n     somewhat depleted minefield to escape, losing two men in the \n     process.\n       Most serving generals especially the desk jockeys, are in \n     favor of mines. The real war-fighters usually want to get rid \n     of them. Whatever defensive punch is lost would be more than \n     offset by the new firearms and missiles that give today's \n     infantry platoon more killing power than a Korea-vintage \n     battalion. ``Mines are not mission-essential,'' says one \n     general, ``but they are budget-essential.'' In 1996, the U.S. \n     Army budgeted $89 million for land-mine warfare. Now the army \n     is fighting to protect every nickel.\n       Still, some retired generals want to ban mines, and I agree \n     with them. Governments can declare land mines illegal, just \n     as chemical weapons were prohibited. Sure, thugs like Saddam \n     Hussein or Ratko Mladic will continue to use them. But users \n     (along with manufacturers and dealers) can be hunted down and \n     punished by an international court. If that happens just a \n     few times, anti-personnel mines will go the way of mustard \n     gas. I'll drink to that, and so will most veterans of foreign \n     wars.\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, let me say one last time that we can ban \nlandmines. We can ban landmines certainly within this century. We can \nban them if the most powerful nation on Earth, the United States, takes \nthe leadership role that it must in this. If we do what so many other \ncountries have already done, and if we, instead of following them, step \nout ahead of them, we can ban these landmines once and for all. If we \ndo, our men and women, when sent into harm's way, will be safer. Our \nhumanitarian workers will be safer, and millions of children and \ninnocent civilians around the world will become safer.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n                [From the New York Times, Apr. 3, 1996]\n\n                  An Open Letter to President Clinton\n\n       Dear Mr. President: We understand that you have announced a \n     United States goal of the eventual elimination of \n     antipersonnel landmines. We take this to mean that you \n     support a permanent and total international ban on the \n     production, stockpiling, sale and use of this weapon.\n       We view such a ban as not only humane, but also militarily \n     responsible.\n       The rationale for opposing antipersonnel landmines is that \n     they are in a category similar to poison gas; they are hard \n     to control and often have unintended harmful consequences \n     (sometimes even for those who employ them). In addition, they \n     are insidious in that their indiscriminate effects persist \n     long after hostilities have ceased, continuing to cause \n     casualties among innocent people, especially farmers and \n     children.\n       We understand that: there are 100 million landmines \n     deployed in the world. Their presence makes normal life \n     impossible in scores of nations. It will take decades of \n     slow, dangerous and painstaking work to remove these mines. \n     The cost in dollars and human lives will be immense. Seventy \n     people will be killed or maimed today, 500 this week, more \n     than 2,000 this month, and more than 26,000 this year, \n     because of landmines.\n       Given the wide range of weaponry available to military \n     forces today, antipersonnel landmines are not essential. \n     Thus, banning them would not undermine the military \n     effectiveness or safety of our forces, nor those of other \n     nations.\n       The proposed ban on antipersonnel landmines does not affect \n     antitank mines, nor does it ban such normally command-\n     detonated weapons as Claymore ``mines,'' leaving unimpaired \n     the use of those undeniably militarily useful weapons.\n       Nor is the ban on antipersonnel landmines a slippery slope \n     that would open the way to efforts to ban additional \n     categories of weapons, since these mines are unique in their \n     indiscriminate, harmful residual potential.\n       We agree with and endorse these views, and conclude that \n     you as Commander-in-Chief could responsibly take the lead in \n     efforts to achieve a total and permanent international ban on \n     the production, stockpiling, sale and use of antipersonnel \n     landmines.

Mr. President, I have introduced The Sexual Offender \nTracking and Identification Act of 1996 with Senators Biden, Hutchison, \nand Faircloth. I would like, this morning, to talk a little bit about \nthis bill, its origins and what it seeks to do.\n  I begin by asking unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a \nletter of endorsement from the National Center for Missing and \nExploited Children.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                       National Center for Missing\n\n\n                                         & Exploited Children,\n\n                                    Arlington, VA, April 16, 1996.\n     To: Senator Phil Gramm.\n     From: Teresa Klingensmith, Manager, Legislative Affairs.\n                                             Date: April 16, 1996.\n     Re Necessity of Sexual Predators Tracking and Identification \n         Act of 1996.\n       The benefit of a national sex offender registry network and \n     database, such as the one envisioned in your bill, cannot be \n     overstated. As we see the effects of the mandates contained \n     in the Wetterling Act--presently 47 states have sex offender \n     registry programs--we are made cognizant of the new obstacles \n     to be tackled with regard to sex offender containment. It is \n     time for the next steps contemplated but not attended to in \n     Wetterling.\n\n[[Page S3422]]\n\n       1. A registry network. Fifty individual state sex offender \n     registries would be sufficient if no sex offender ever moved \n     interstate. Unfortunately, that is certainly not the case. \n     Indeed, these offenders tend to be particularly transient \n     individuals, probably due to the need to conceal the darker \n     side of their lives and seek out new victims. As these \n     offenders move from state to state, they can easily get lost \n     in the paper-shuffling from state to state. A central, \n     federal database and verification system will insure that \n     these individuals do not ``fall through the cracks'' as they \n     move from state to state.\n       2. Community notification. Thirty states have enacted \n     community notification laws, and more are being considered in \n     the 1996 state sessions. These laws remain very popular, \n     despite the current judicial debate surrounding them.\\1\\ \n     However, like sex offender registries, these laws are \n     ineffective in the larger scope if offenders can evade them \n     simply by moving across a state line. Already, I receive \n     letters from offenders in prison requesting information about \n     which states have notification programs and which do not. \n     These offenders are not stupid; we must be as clever as they \n     if we intend to protect our children. No current federal law \n     suggests the passage of a community notification program as \n     strongly as your legislation or provides the background on \n     which to build such a national system. No current community \n     notification program will be truly effective until all 50 \n     states have relatively uniform programs; this bill the next \n     step towards such coverage.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n     \\1\\ Even this judicial debate centers on specific aspects of \n     these laws (i.e. retroactive application) rather than on the \n     spirit of the community notification program. The basic \n     theory of notification has withstood all challenges.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n       3. Release of information. Child molesters dedicate an \n     enormous amount of energy obtaining legitimate access to \n     children. This includes securing positions (if possible) in \n     day care centers, child youth organizations, schools, \n     community centers, etc. In recognition of this, states have \n     responded by passing background screening laws requiring \n     criminal background checks for those who have access/contact \n     with children. Unfortunately, most of these checks stop at \n     state lines. Without a national database of sex offenders and \n     authorized access to that database, these background checks \n     won't accomplish their true purpose. We strongly support your \n     effort to provide such a database.\n       Sex offenders do not only victimize the women and children \n     they attack; they victimize society as a whole. As a nation \n     we have a depleted sense of security and trust as a result of \n     these individuals. To combat these offenses and their long-\n     term results requires a plan that addresses all the aspects \n     of their behavior and strives to empower the community to \n     protect itself and its children. NCMEC has long advocated a \n     reasonable, responsible, long-range approach to containing \n     sex offender recidivism. I believe your bill is a positive \n     contribution to such a long-range plan and necessary to its \n     development.\n       The inclusion on the FBI's Wanted Persons Index for \n     unverifiable offenders is a clever and strong answer to a \n     persistent question. Many offenders may be coerced into \n     updating their registration information by the threat of \n     inclusion on that list. It is a practical, no-nonsense \n     solution.\n       We support your efforts and commend your interest in child \n     protection.\n\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, let me begin with a tragic story, and then \ntalk about a Texas law, what other States have done in the area of \nsexual predators, why what they are doing cannot work unless we do our \npart, and then outline what we are trying to do in this bill.\n  Three years ago, a 7-year-old girl named Ashley Estell went to a park \nin Plano, TX, which is an upscale suburb of Dallas, one of the finest \ncommunities in America, and certainly we would assume one of the \nsafest. She went to the park that day to watch her brother play soccer. \nAshley's brother played in the second of three games to be played that \nday and while her parents stayed to watch the final game, Ashley went \nto play on a swing set. Although there were 2,000 people in the park \nthat day, this little girl was, nevertheless, abducted, raped, and \nbrutally murdered.\n  The FBI stepped in to investigate the case, and asked parents who \nwere there that day to turn in any video cassette recordings they might \nhave taken of games on the playground. The FBI, using the 14 tapes that \nwere turned in, was able to go back and identify a known sexual \npredator who had been there the day Ashley was abducted. They \napprehended him, and after a change of venue to Midland, TX, he was \nconvicted and sentenced to death. His record was a record that we read \nabout every day in the newspaper--he had been previously convicted, had \nbeen sentenced to 10 years in prison, had gotten out in just 18 months, \nand then went to this park and abducted and murdered a little girl.\n  What shocked Plano, the whole metroplex and, to some degree, the \nentire country, was not just this tragic crime, but the fact that the \nFBI, in looking at these 14 tapes, identified not one, but two sexual \npredators who were there in the park on that day. It turned out that \nthe referee of all three soccer games played that day was a convicted \nsexual predator, who had fled from North Carolina to Texas to avoid \nbeing sent to prison for 10 years.\n  One of the greatest tragedies was that the soccer league had no way \nof knowing who this person was and no way of checking his record. \nFurther, there is no national database that can be used to check the \nrecords of anybody else who wants to be a scoutmaster for the Girl \nScouts or the Boy Scouts, who wants to work for the Boys and Girls \nClub, or wants to be a Big Brother or Big Sister.\n  And so, in light of this terrible tragedy, Florence Shapiro, an \noutstanding young State senator in my State of Texas, wrote a series of \nbills called Ashley's laws, named after this little girl. These bills \nsought, among other things, to set up a statewide tracking system for \nsex offenders, and required a minimum mandatory sentence of life \nimprisonment without parole for a second sexual offense or for \naggravated sexual assault.\n  Under the tracking system in Texas, before convicted sexual predators \ncan be released from prison, they have to be photographed, \nfingerprinted, and have a file built on them. Then, when they leave \nprison, they have to register with law enforcement authorities in the \ntown that they move into. The law enforcement authorities then notify \nthe school system, print a notice in the newspaper, and make the data \navailable to local civic organizations, local groups, and other groups \nwhere you have substantial concentrations of children. With this \nsystem, which is in place today, if somebody wants to be a scoutmaster \nin Plano, TX, the scouting council can go to the local police \ndepartment and say, ``This person wants to be a scoutmaster. Can you \nlook on your computer data base and see if there is a reason that we \nshould be concerned about trusting young children to this person?'' \nThis system has been set up in Texas, 46 other States have established \nsimilar programs, and I believe Texas' is a model system.\n\n  The problem is, since each State has its own individual program, when \nsomeone commits a sex crime in Texas and moves to Arizona, there is no \nmechanism to pick them up in Arizona. The same, obviously, is true if \nsomebody commits a sex crime in Chicago, goes to prison, gets out, and \nthen moves to College Station, TX. There simply is no mechanism to pick \nthem up once they cross State lines.\n  Senator Biden, Senator Hutchison, Senator Faircloth, and I have \noffered a bill to change this by having the FBI set up, working with \nthe States, a national data base on sexual predators. As the Presiding \nOfficer knows, we are in the process of building a massive criminal \ndata base which is expected to be on-line by the year 2000. This system \nwill be the most comprehensive data base on criminals in the history of \nmankind. I was chairman of the Commerce, Justice, and State Department \nAppropriations Subcommittee last year when Florence Shapiro, our State \nsenator, was writing her bill, and it struck me, in providing $88 \nmillion for this program, that this sexual predator effort is never \ngoing to work as long as sexual predators can move across State lines \nand escape the system. Needless to say, we are already beginning to get \nevidence which proves this. Even though most of these State laws are \nalready in effect, it is becoming increasingly clear that exactly what \nyou would expect happen has indeed happened; that is, sexual predators, \nin Texas and elsewhere, who are required to register when they move \ninto a community are trying to escape this increased scrutiny. Although \nwe do not have enough data yet to show this conclusively, I think it is \nincreasingly clear that the interstate migration of convicted sexual \npredators has exploded as these convicts try to exploit the weakness of \nthe current system.\n  What we are trying to do in this bill is to have the FBI set up a \nnational data base in conjunction with those States that have \nregistration laws, and set up a data base for the three States that \nhave not yet acted in this area, in\n\n[[Page S3423]]\n\norder to develop a national system that all States can participate in \nas partners. Under this system, any time a sexual predator is released \nfrom prison, we will have a comprehensive file on them, and wherever \nthey move we will ensure that the local law enforcement authorities are \nnotified. We will leave it up to the State and local officials as to \nhow they want to use this information. Some States, like Texas, have \nvery aggressive programs which provide for school notification, public \nnotification, and a program through which volunteer civic organizations \ncan use the data base to determine whether someone should be put in a \nposition of trust with regard to children. We do not get into telling \nthe States how to use the data base, we simply assure that they have \naccess to a nationwide sexual offender registry.\n  Let me, in conclusion, provide an example of how this system might \nwork once this bill is passed and the data base is operating. Let us \nsay that in Tucson you had the principal of an elementary school call \nup the police chief and say, ``We have a strange guy hanging around our \nschool, and maybe I am overreacting to this, but our janitor thinks he \nsaw this guy looking into a bathroom window.'' What would happen with \nthis system in place is that the police chief in Tucson could send a \npolice officer out to the school, get a description of this individual, \nget any evidence there might be--a footprint, for example--and if they \nhad a computer in the patrol car, they could actually put the data into \nthe computer at that moment and ask the data base, ``Can you take this \ndescription and match it against any registered sexual predator within \n25, 50, 100, or 1,000 miles of Tucson, AZ?'' The computer could \nthen generate, for example, six people who meet this description, and \nproduce color, digitized photographs of those individuals. These photos \ncould then be immediately shown to the principal, to the kids, to the \nteachers, and to the janitor, and, hopefully, they could identify this \nperson.\n\n  In my State, it is a felony for a person who has previously been \nconvicted as a sexual predator against children to be within a certain \ndistance of the school whether they are still on parole or not, and so \nin Texas the police could go out and arrest this person and put them \nback in jail before they could hurt someone.\n  It is important to note that sexual predators have a recidivism rate \nthat is higher than any other known class of criminal activity. The \nprobability that someone who is convicted of being a sexual predator, \nespecially if it is a crime against a child, committing that crime \nagain is estimated to be 10 times higher than the probability that an \narmed robber who is apprehended, convicted, and sent to prison will \ncommit the act of armed robbery again. As a result, we have a special \nobligation to be vigilant in protecting society from sexual predators.\n  Finally, I see this bill as being a first step toward using the power \nof the information age to deny criminals the one thing they need to \nprey on society, and that is a dark corner to hide in. I believe that \nwith the explosion of the information age, if we are willing to commit \nthe resources to hire and train law enforcement officials, to build \nprisons, and to elect and appoint judges that are serious about \nprotecting society, we have the ability to protect our children from \npeople for whom the preponderance of the evidence shows that they are \nguilty. I think the power of the information age in denying criminals--\nin this case, sexual predators--a dark corner to hide in is going to \ngive us the ability to have the safest society we have had in over half \na century.\n  I want to be certain that we take this opportunity to achieve these \ngoals and I hope my colleagues will look at this bill and will join us \nin this effort. We hope to see this bill become law this spring and do \nnot know of any organized effort against it. The ACLU opposed similar \nprovisions in my State, arguing that we were violating the right to \nprivacy of people who had previously been convicted as being sexual \npredators. My response to this charge, however, is that you do not have \nto be on this list. If you are concerned about your privacy, do not \nmolest our children. If you do not commit a sexual crime, then you will \nnot lose your privacy. But if you do commit this kind of terrible \ncrime, part of our response will be to take extraordinary procedures to \nprotect society.\n  So I recommend this to my colleagues, I thank the Chair, and I yield \nthe floor.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Yesterday, Senator Gramm, Senator Hutchison, Senator \nFaircloth, and I introduced Senate bill 1675--legislation to strengthen \nand improve the Jacob Wetterling Crimes Against Children and Sexually \nViolent Offender Registration Act.\n  The Jacob Wetterling Act requires States to enact laws to register \nand track the most violent, the most horrible--and least likely to be \nrehabilitated--criminals our Nation faces today. I refer to those \ncriminals who attack our children and criminals who are sexually \nviolent predators.\n  These criminals must be tracked. And local law enforcement must know \nwhen these criminals are in their communities. This was the reason I \nworked to include this important measure in the 1994 crime law. And I \nwill also point out that almost all States have taken great strides to \nbuild an effective tracking system.\n  Now we seek to build upon this progress to meet three specific goals:\n  First, we must have a nationwide system that will help State and \nlocal law enforcement track these offenders as they move from State to \nState and will help by providing a backup system of tracking.\n  Second, while most States have established or are about to establish \nthese systems, if any States fail to act, we cannot allow there to be a \nblack hole where sexual predators can hide--and are then lost to all \nStates. A nationwide system will track offenders if States do not \nmaintain registration systems.\n  Third, we must ensure that the most serious sexual predators are \nrequired to remain registered with law enforcement officials for the \nrest of their lives.\n  All of these key goals will be met by this legislation. In addition, \nour bill will offer some improvements which are made possible by the \nnationwide system this bill will provide. For example, our bill will--\n  Require all offenders to verify their address on a regular basis by \nreturning verification cards with their fingerprints.\n  Require that a nationwide warning is issued whenever an offender \nfails to verify their address or when an offender cannot be located.\n  Institute tough penalties for offenders who willfully fail to meet \ntheir obligations to register with the nationwide system in States \nwhere there is no registration and in cases of offenders who move from \none State to another.\n  Notify law enforcement officials not only when an offender moves to \ntheir area, but also when an offender moves out of their neighborhood.\n  To offer just one of the practical problems a national data base will \nhelp local law enforcement address--Delaware law enforcement, because \nDelaware is so close to other States, will certainly need to know if a \nsexual predator lives just over the line in Pennsylvania. And only a \nnational data base can provide this information.\n  To offer a real life example of why a nationwide system is needed--in \nDelaware, a sex offender was released last year. Fortunately, \nDelaware's offender registration law requires this offender--Freddy \nMarine--to be tracked by Delaware law enforcement. Since his release, \nMarine has moved to another State. The nationwide system established by \nthis bill will help make sure that if Freddy Marine moves back to \nDelaware--our State law enforcement will know, and knowledge is the key \nto effective enforcement.\n  Let me also point out that our bill would still allow States the \nflexibility to decide when a community should be notified of the \npresence of a sexual offender, as State and local law enforcement is in \nthe best position to decide when and how notification in their area is \nwarranted. Frankly, our bill has erred on the side of registering many \nmore offenders than may be necessary. Therefore, the specific decision \nto require community notification must be left to the State and local \nofficials.\n  In summary, the sex offender tracking and identification bill is \npossible because States such as Delaware and Texas have done the hard \nwork to build statewide registration systems. We\n\n[[Page S3424]]\n\nnow seek to build a system where all movements of sexually violent and \nchild offenders can be tracked and we will go a long way toward the day \nwhen none of these predators will fall between the cracks.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to extend morning \nbusiness time for 10 minutes so that I might speak in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Coverdell). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I say to the Senators who are handling the bill that when \nthey come to the floor I will certainly immediately relinquish the \nfloor.\n  Let me say to the Senator from Texas before he leaves the floor that \nI am interested in cosponsoring that piece of legislation. I met with a \ngroup of law enforcement officers recently in Dickinson, ND, in fact, \nlast week. We talked about a wide range of subjects, including the \ntriple ``i'' index, the interstate identification index, the criminal \nrecords base, and there are two things that are deficient. One is there \nare a great many criminal records dealing with the criminal history of \nsomeone who is below 18 years of age, someone who has committed a \nmurder, a rape, armed robbery, and so on, that you cannot get at. If \nyou inquire from a law office in Texas and this person had committed \nthe act in South Dakota, North Dakota, or Nebraska, those records are \nexpunged and withheld. So you do not have the complete criminal \nhistory.\n  The other thing that they talked about was this issue of sexual \npredators. It is fine for States to have the system, but, if they are \nnot together and interlocked in this interstate identification system, \nsomehow it does not respond to the way we want it to respond.\n  I listened to what the Senator from Texas had to say. I want to \ncosponsor the legislation and work with him and others. I think this \nmakes a great deal of good sense.\n  Mr. GRAMM. I thank the Senator. Let me say we are looking at exactly \nthe problem of at what point should a juvenile go on this database. It \nis clear to me that, in the society in which we live today, by the time \nmany of these hardened criminals, these sexual predators, are adults, \nthey have already committed many crimes and have established a life \nstyle which they are unlikely to break. Senator Biden and I are working \non these kinds of problems, and we will happily put the Senator on as a \ncosponsor.\n  We would also be happy to try to incorporate into our bill any \nsuggestions the Senator or his law enforcement officials might have.\n  We have a blueprint of what we want to do, but we are very open to \ntry to improve it, and I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I appreciate the Senator's remarks. I will cosponsor the \nlegislation and be anxious to work with him on the juvenile crime \nissue.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/04/17/senate-section/article/S3421-1", "month": "04", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "17", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3424-S3425]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          LEGISLATIVE AGENDAS\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Let me, Mr. President, just take a moment to describe \nwhat happened yesterday since the Senate went into recess and I was \nunable to speak about it.\n  There are stories in the press today which say that the majority \nleader pulled the bill on immigration and said that some were trying to \nhold the immigration bill hostage in the Senate yesterday.\n  That is not the case at all. It is simply not accurate. It is true \nthat amendments were offered to the immigration bill. My amendment was \noffered yesterday that deals with a Social Security issue, but I \nindicated to the person managing the bill I would be willing to accept \na 20- or 30-minute time agreement on my amendment. It was not a \ncircumstance where my amendment was going to hold up the bill. There \nwould have been a minimum wage amendment, but Senator Kennedy indicated \nhe was willing to accept a time agreement of perhaps an hour, perhaps a \nhalf-hour, on that minimum wage amendment. So no one could accurately \ndescribe that as holding any kind of a bill hostage.\n  I want to describe the circumstance we were in yesterday and why I \nhad to offer the Social Security amendment. The majority leader has \nannounced in the Senate that he intends to seek reconsideration of the \nconstitutional amendment to balance the budget. He has the right to do \nthat, and when he does it, as I understand the procedure, there will be \nno debate and no opportunity for an amendment. That is the procedure \nunder which he will seek reconsideration.\n  As a result of that, those of us who care about an issue that is \nrelated to the constitutional amendment to balance the budget, namely \nthe issue of using Social Security trust funds as part of the revenue \nto balance the budget, wanted to offer a sense-of-the-Senate resolution \nsaying any constitutional amendment to balance the budget that is \nbrought to the Senate floor should create a firewall between the Social \nSecurity trust funds and the operating revenues of the Federal \nGovernment.\n  Now, why is that important? Because if you do not do that, we will \nhave nearly $700 billion of Social Security trust funds misused. They \nwere supposed to have been collected to be saved for the baby boom \ngeneration when they retire. But instead, they will be used as revenues \non the revenue side of the budget to show a lower budget deficit.\n  Some of us feel that is wrong. I know that yesterday it was charged, \nwell, this is just politics. It is not just politics. It is an \nenormously important question that this Senate must address. So far it \nhas addressed it in the wrong way.\n\n  The minimum wage, which was also scheduled to be offered as an \namendment by Senator Kennedy and some others, is an issue they have \nworked on for over a year. There was not any intention to hold the bill \nup but simply to say on behalf of those folks out there working on a \nminimum wage who have for 6 years not received any kind of an increase \nat all, they have been frozen for 6 years and have lost a half a dollar \nof their wage to inflation in terms of purchasing power, we will try to \ngive you a slight increase in the minimum wage.\n  That is what the fight was about. It was not a fight to try to hold \nup the bill.\n  Now, the majority leader came to the floor and, apparently with great \nfrustration, said, well, this Social Security amendment and others have \nnothing to do with the underlying bill.\n  The majority leader understands how the Senate works. He has been \nhere for a long, long time. He came to the floor when we had family and \nmedical leave in this Chamber and offered a gays in the military \namendment that had nothing to do with the bill. It was because he \nwanted to offer his amendment dealing with gays in the military. It was \ncompletely extraneous. It was nonrelevant. But he did it because he \nfelt it was important to do.\n  On the immigration bill yesterday, the only opportunity, it seemed to \nus, to be able to register on this issue of the misuse of the Social \nSecurity funds in a constitutional amendment to balance the budget, the \nonly opportunity we would have had before the majority leader would \nbring up the vote on the constitutional amendment to balance the budget \nwas to offer it before he did it, and so we used the first vehicle that \ncame along.\n  It is not an attempt to frustrate the immigration bill. Much in the \nimmigration bill I support, as do many of my colleagues. The \nimmigration bill will pass the Senate, in my judgment, if the majority \nleader brings it back to the floor. But he is not going to be in a \ncircumstance where he comes to the floor of the Senate and says: Here \nis our agenda, and you vote on our amendments and our agenda when we \nwant to vote; and with respect to the things you care about, we are \nsorry but they do not count; they are irrelevant.\n  It is not the way the Senate works. And so we are not trying to hold \nup any piece of legislation. We very much want the Senate to register \nitself on a couple of important issues.\n  With respect to whether these issues are just politics, as a couple \nof people have suggested, I guess if we get to the point when we are \ntalking about a minimum wage for millions of Americans who have not had \nan adjustment in the minimum wage for 6 years, if we get to the point \nwhere we say, well, that is just politics if we want to talk about the \nminimum wage, they have changed the definition of politics. If it is \njust politics when we want to talk about $700 billion of Social \nSecurity trust funds being misused to show a lower budget deficit, then \nthey have changed\n\n[[Page S3425]]\n\nthe definition of politics. That is not politics, in my judgment. It is \nwhat we ought to be discussing in the Senate.\n  My hope is that when we finish the antiterrorism bill, which I think \nwill be moved out of the Senate with a yes vote, we will turn to the \nimmigration bill, and we will deal with these amendments.\n  The fact is these amendments are not going to go away. I heard the \nmajority leader and others say, well, those who offer these amendments \nsimply want to cover their vote against the constitutional amendment.\n  We had two votes on the constitutional amendments last year. I voted \nfor one, which was the right one, which did not misuse the Social \nSecurity trust funds, and I voted against the one that did misuse the \nSocial Security trust funds. You cannot take money from workers' \npaychecks and say to them we promise this is dedicated for only one \npurpose; it goes into a trust fund; it is going to be saved for Social \nSecurity when we need it when the baby boomers retire, and then say, \noh, by the way, we have changed our mind; the $71 billion this year \nthat we collect above what we need for Social Security, we are going to \nuse that to balance the Federal budget.\n\n  This is not a trust fund. The fund ought not to have the word \n``trust'' in it if you are going to use it for other purposes, and it \nis not politics for us to start talking about some honesty in budgeting \nand protecting the Social Security trust funds for the days when this \ncountry is going to need them when the baby boomers retire.\n  There are plenty of issues we need to deal with in the Senate, and if \nevery time we come to the floor of the Senate and talk about issues of \nsubstance, whether it is the Social Security trust funds or a \nconstitutional amendment to balance the budget or for that matter the \nminimum wage, it is alleged somehow it is totally political, then I \nguess all of the activities of the Senate will be political this year. \nBut some of us happen to think some of these issues ought to be dealt \nwith, and those who think they will avoid votes in the coming months \nshould understand we will come to the floor again and again and again, \nand it is not to play games. It is because it is serious business when \nyou are talking about $700 billion in the Social Security trust funds, \nand it is also serious business when you are talking about folks who \nhave worked on minimum wages for 6 years and have had no adjustment \nrelative to inflation.\n  So, Mr. President, I understand we have the antiterrorism bill that \nwill be coming to the floor this morning. I hope we make good progress \non it. I think there is a consent agreement of some sort with respect \nto amendments. That bill ought to get out of the Senate soon. I will \nlikely vote for it. Then I hope we can turn to immigration and deal \nwith some of these issues.\n  I have watched what has happened in the Senate now for some long \ntime, and I do not want people coming to the floor of the Senate and \nsaying, well, we offer all of our amendments, any amendment, any time \nwe want on any bill we want, but if you offer an amendment on minimum \nwage here, somehow you are playing politics.\n  That is not the way the Senate works. If one side is able to use \nlegislation to advance the policies they want to advance, then the \nother side is going to do the same thing, and it ought not be a \nsurprise to anybody. I just do not like to see stories in which we are \ntold that somehow somebody yesterday was holding an immigration bill \nhostage. Both amendments that were to be offered to the immigration \nbill would have been subject to, and the authors of both amendments had \nsaid that they would agree to, very short time agreements. Nobody was \nholding anything hostage. People ought to know that.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I make a point of order a \nquorum is not present.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/04/17/senate-section/article/S3424-1", "month": "04", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "17", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3425-S3426]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           IMMIGRATION REFORM\n\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, I come to the floor today to make a few \nbrief comments on the immigration proposals that we will be debating \nover the next few days. My first observation is to recognize the \ndistinct set of issues that relate to and will be debated with respect \nto legal and illegal immigration. I commend the work of the Judiciary \nCommittee for recognizing the merits of considering two separate bills \nrather than one package, and I strongly endorse the committee's \nposition.\n  Mr. President, what I hear from many of my constituents on the issue \nof immigration is the growing costs absorbed by the system, that is \nFederal, State, county, and local governments, to continue to provide \npublic services and benefits to the immigrant community. And recently, \nin my home State of Colorado, the increasing number of illegal \nimmigrants, in particular, has been a growing concern.\n  Further, recent statistics, compiled by the Congressional Research \nService and other recent studies, clearly document the enormous \nfinancial burden placed on Government entities to provide services to \nthe immigrant community. It is my belief that without significant \nchanges to curb the flow of illegal immigration, and to revisit current \nbenefits bestowed to legal and illegal immigrants, this financial \nburden will continue to increase dramatically.\n  For example, a recent study out of Rice University, concluded that \nimmigration costs to the United States exceeded $50 billion in 1994 \nalone. While the conclusion reached in this study are subject to \ndebate, there is nonetheless a compelling need for significant change.\n  With over 4 million illegal aliens currently in this country, and \nover 300,000 arriving annually, the increasing burdens on our society \ndemand our attention.\n  I would like to point out that in my home State of Colorado, for the \n5-month period from November 1995 through March 1996, the Immigration \nand Naturalization Service [INS], contacted a total of 3,486 illegals. \nOf those, 2,014 were deported, while 1,472 were let go.\n  Mr. President, I would like to bring your attention to a newspaper \narticle from the Denver Post dated April 12, 1996, that reads in part, \n``Last week, a van filled with 29 illegal immigrants was stopped on \nInterstate 70 in Grand Junction, but a lack of detention funds kept the \nINS from arresting them or their driver.''\n  These incidents come just days after the INS Operation Mountain \nPasses ended. As a result of this program, designed to specifically \ncrack down on smugglers, roughly 1,300 illegal immigrants were stopped, \narrested, and deported. However, and not so ironic, when the money ran \nout this program ended.\n  Again as recently as Monday, in Colorado Springs, CO, a van \ncontaining 13 suspected illegal immigrants was stopped by the Colorado \nState Patrol. Unfortunately, for some unknown reason the INS could not \nrespond. Because the State patrol does not have the authority to arrest \nillegal immigrants, these individuals were released. This represents \nthe second time in less than a week that suspected illegal immigrants \nhave been released because of inadequate INS response capability.\n  As a result of changes in the dynamics of illegal immigration \nmigration Colorado has now become a major corridor for illegal \nimmigrants migrating east. Without the assistance of increased law \nenforcement efforts, such as Operation Mountain Passes, I am concerned \nthat these successful efforts may be curtailed.\n  While I support efforts to increase law enforcement efforts to curb \nillegal immigration, both at the border and to other impacted States, I \ndo have concerns with provisions adopted in the House measure that may \nbe considered in this Chamber.\n\n  Primarily, I am concerned with the provisions adopted in the House \nbill that seek to deny public education to illegal immigrant children \nas a means of reducing the flow of illegal immigrants into this \ncountry. Congress should not be so overzealous in its endeavor to \nreduce the influx of illegal aliens that we adopt stopgap measures that \nare actually destined to increase the demands on public funding by \nexpanding the number of America's undereducated and unemployed.\n  Any provision that seeks to deny children access to education will \nplace\n\n[[Page S3426]]\n\na massive burden upon our already overburdened community services, \nschools, and local law enforcement agencies. At a time when local and \nState leaders are making strenuous efforts to keep kids off the streets \nand in school, education should be employed as an important tool to \nhelp solve America's problems, not used as a weapon against its most \nhelpless victims.\n  Mr. President, reducing the flow of illegal immigrants must first \nfocus upon measures that will actually restrict and hopefully prevent \nillegal immigrants from entering this country. I support provisions in \nS. 1664, the Immigration Control and Financial Responsibility Act of \n1996, that provides for more border patrol agents, as well as the \naddition of 300 full-time Immigration and Naturalization Service \ninvestigators for each of the next 3 fiscal years. I believe these \nprovisions will provide a much needed boost to the understaffed and \noverworked agencies that we entrust to keep illegal aliens out of this \ncountry. Our focus, again, should be on the prevention and control of \nillegal immigration, rather than on retribution for illegally \nimmigrating to this country.\n  Each of my colleagues brings a certain perspective to the immigration \ndebate. I have listened to much of the debate and realized that the \ngreat lot of us are products of immigrant families. Personally, I \nbelieve I have unique perspective to add to the debate.\n  Over 60 years ago, my mother legally immigrated from Portugal. Like \nmany people during that time she wanted the opportunity to make a \nbetter life for herself and an opportunity to succeed, but to do so in \na law abiding way. While on the other hand, my father comes from \npeople, the Northern Cheyenne people, who can document their ties to \nthis land, to this continent for hundreds of years prior to the first \nexplorers of this continent. If I were to take his advice, and the \nadvice of many native American people, they might suggest that we all \npack our bags and go home.\n  Obviously reality dictates real and pragmatic solutions. However, I \nmight also observe that it seems ironic that if this same debate were \nto take place 100 years ago many of my colleagues, including myself, \nmight not be here today.\n  In closing, I look forward to the debate on these immigration \nproposals and hope that this Chamber can adopt fair and effective \nimmigration reform. Let us remember that, with few exceptions, we are \nall ancestors of immigrants.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of an article \nthat appeared in the Colorado Springs Gazette Telegraph, on \nimmigration, be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n           Suspected Illegal Aliens Let Go After INS No-Show\n\n                        (By Teresa Owen-Cooper)\n\n       Thirteen suspected illegal immigrants from Mexico were \n     detained briefly in Colorado Springs on Monday night but \n     released after federal authorities couldn't respond to take \n     them into custody, according to the Colorado State Patrol.\n       The 12 men and one woman from Oaxaca, Mexico, on their way \n     to Tennessee to pick fruit, were stopped on Interstate 25 \n     near U.S. Highway 24 about 7 p.m. after their van was \n     weaving, said state patrol trooper Chuck Coffrin.\n       Coffrin found 13 people inside the 1972 Ford panel van, and \n     none were able to produce documentation that they were U.S. \n     citizens, officials said.\n       State patrol officials called the U.S. Immigration and \n     Naturalization Service, who couldn't respond, Coffrin said, \n     adding that the INS gave no indication why.\n       Because the state patrol doesn't have authority to arrest \n     illegal immigrants, the 13 people were released, Coffrin \n     said.\n       It was the second time in less than a week that the state \n     patrol has stopped a van carrying suspected illegal \n     immigrants from Mexico and been forced to release them \n     because the INS didn't take action.\n       On Thursday, the state patrol stopped a van, carrying 19 \n     people, on I-25 about 15 miles south of Colorado Springs, \n     because their van was weaving, according to the state patrol.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/04/17/senate-section/article/S3425-1", "month": "04", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "17", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3426]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           GULF WAR SYMPTOMS\n\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, ever since the conclusion of the gulf \nwar, returning veterans have complained about a variety of symptoms \nincluding dizziness, nausea, loss of equilibrium, and depression.\n  All of us have visited veterans in our States. And through a series \nof hearings, those of us on the Veterans' Affairs Committee have been \ndismayed by the steadfast denial on the part of the Pentagon and the \nDepartment of Defense to acknowledge these brave men and women are \nsuffering the after effects of all airborne or waterborne agent or \nagents that have caused their sickness.\n  As late as this week, Mr. President, the Pentagon issued a statement \nsaying that after spending $80 million of taxpayer money, they found no \nevidence of sickness-inducing agents during the gulf war. Kind of \nsounds like Vietnam and agent orange all over again.\n  Well, lo and behold, Mr. President, thanks to an extensive study done \nby the University of Texas through a grant given by Ross Perot, those \ncomplaints from our men and women in uniform appear to be true, and the \nculprit was a combination of three agents acting in concert with each \nother.

Mr. President, I rise today to honor the China-Burma-India \nVeterans Association [CBIVA] of Nevada. These veterans played a \ndecisive role in World War II. The China-Burma-India Veterans were \nresponsible for driving the Japanese out of the treacherous Burma \njungles and for building a road from Burma through the Himalayas to \nChina, which was originally called the Burma Road. The China-Burma-\nIndia Veterans also flew the most famous of the B-29 airplanes, brought \nthe air war to Japan and its occupied territories and ended the war \nwith the historic atom bombing of mainland Japan.\n  The China-Burma-India Association was established in 1948 in \nMilwaukee, WI and is now a nonprofit organization of approximately \n7,000 veterans. In Las Vegas, a group of the brave and courageous \nveterans has established a chapter of their own called the Silver State \nBasha No. 133 with Eugene Henkin as their current commander. The China-\nBurma-India Veterans Association, Silver State Basha No. 133, keeps \ntheir veterans in touch by sending out more than 200 newsletters to \nChina-Burma-India Veterans of Las Vegas and surrounding communities.\n  The Silver State Basha No. 133 is an example of the many fine men and \nwomen in our country who had the courage, sacrifice, and devotion to \nserve in World War II. On April 21-23, the China-Burma-India Veterans \nAssociation World War II will hold its western area reunion in Las \nVegas at the Rio Hotel and Casino. I am pleased to recognize this group \nand would like to wish the China-Burma-India Veterans Association best \nwishes on a successful reunion.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/04/17/senate-section/article/S3426-2", "month": "04", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "17", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3426-S3427]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      TRIBUTE TO JOHN O. HEMPERLEY\n\n  Mr. HATFIELD. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to John O. \nHemperley, the Budget Officer of the Library of Congress, who passed \naway last Saturday.\n  Members and staff of the Appropriations Committee rely heavily on the \nexpertise, efficiency, and responsiveness of agency budget officers. \nThroughout our Federal Government there is a corps of budget \nprofessionals who set the example of dedicated public service. John \nHemperley embodied the highest standards of his profession. He \npossessed a knowledge and understanding of the Library's budget that \nwas unsurpassed, and he was unfailingly responsive in sharing that \nknowledge with our committee and its staff. He was fierce in his \ndefense of the Library's mission and the budget funding that mission, \nbut he never misrepresented the facts, and he always\n\n[[Page S3427]]\n\nfaithfully executed the budget enacted by the Congress.\n  The Library of Congress is a unique and treasured institution. It is \nthe greatest repository of knowledge in the history of the world, and \nfor 196 years the Congress of the United States has supported and \nnurtured its development. Today the Library faces the challenge of \nproviding new electronic services to all its constituent groups while \nmaintaining its traditional services to the Congress and the Nation, \nall in a time of severe fiscal constraint.\n  John O. Hemperley was a unique and treasured individual. For the past \n23 years, he supported and nurtured the Library of Congress in its \nrelationship with the Committee on Appropriations. He will be sorely \nmissed, not only by those who knew and loved him here in the Senate and \nin the Library, but by all those who may never have known him but who \nbenefit daily from the enormous resources the Library provides. The \nchallenges the Library faces will be more daunting without him.\n  Mr. President, I know I speak for Senator Mack, the chairman of our \nLegislative Branch Appropriations Subcommittee, and for all other \nmembers of the Appropriations Committee, and our staff, in expressing \nour great sorrow and extending sincere condolences to John's wife, Bess \nHemperley, their children, and grandchildren. And may John rest in \npeace with God.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/04/17/senate-section/article/S3426-3", "month": "04", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "17", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3427]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             CHANGE OF VOTE\n\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN.

Mr. President, I have mentioned many times that memorable \nevening in 1972 when the television networks reported that I had won \nthe Senate race in North Carolina.\n  At first, I was stunned because I had never been confident that I \nwould be the first Republican in history to be elected to the U.S. \nSenate by the people of North Carolina. When I got over that, I made a \ncommitment to myself that I would never fail to see a young person, or \na group of young people, who wanted to see me.\n  I have kept that commitment and it has proved enormously meaningful \nto me because I have been inspired by the estimated 60,000 young people \nwith whom I have visited during the 23 years I have been in the Senate.\n  A large percentage of them have been concerned about the total \nFederal debt which recently exceeded $5 trillion. Of course, Congress \nis responsible for creating this monstrous debt which coming \ngenerations will have to pay.\n  Mr. President, the young people and I almost always discuss the fact \nthat under the U.S. Constitution, no President can spend a dime of \nFederal money that has not first been authorized and appropriated by \nboth the House and Senate of the United States.\n  That is why I began making these daily reports to the Senate on \nFebruary 25, 1992. I decided that it was important that a daily record \nbe made of the precise size of the Federal debt which, at the close of \nbusiness yesterday, Tuesday, April 16, stood at $5,142,250,889,027.95. \nThis amounts to $19,430.38 for every man, woman, and child in America \non a per capita basis.\n  The increase in the national debt since my report yesterday--which \nidentified the total Federal debt as of close of business on Monday, \nApril 15, 1996--shows an increase of more than two billion dollars \n$2,239,481,250.00, to be exact. That 1-day increase is enough to match \nthe money needed by approximately 332,070 students to pay their college \ntuitions for 4 years.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/04/17/senate-section/article/S3427-2", "month": "04", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "17", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3427]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Under the previous order, the Senate will now \nresume consideration of the conference report accompanying S. 735, \nwhich the clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A conference report to accompany S. 735, an act to prevent \n     and punish acts of terrorism and for other purposes.\n\n  The Senate resumed the consideration of the conference report.\n\n\n                           Motion to Recommit\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I move to recommit the conference report on \nthe bill S. 735 to the committee of conference with instructions to the \nmanagers on the part of the Senate to disagree to the conference \nsubstitute recommended by the committee of conference and insist on \nstriking the text of section 414 (relating to summary exclusion), \nsection 422 (relating to modification of asylum procedures) and section \n423 (relating to preclusion of judicial review) from the conference \nsubstitute.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There are 30 minutes on the motion, to be \nequally divided.\n  Who yields time?\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I yield myself 6 minutes.\n  Mr. President, I will ask for the yeas and nays on this at the \nappropriate time but, I understand that the distinguished chairman of \nthe committee is on his way to the floor. I would not make such a \nrequest until he was on the floor.\n  I am not taking this action lightly. I understand there is a real \nconcern on motions to recommit, but this is a very, very serious \nmatter.\n  I understand the symbolism of trying to have this conference report \nadopted by the House on the 1-year anniversary of the terrible bombing \nof the Federal building in Oklahoma City and, for that matter, the 3-\nyear anniversary of the tragic end of the siege near Waco. It is one \nthing to say we want to schedule a resolution or sense of the Congress \nto coincide with a memorial day but here we are talking about a very \nsignificant piece of legislation. While I think that all of us abhor \nwhat happened in Oklahoma--certainly, no sane American could take any \npleasure in what happened in the tragedy in Oklahoma City--we also have \na responsibility as U.S. Senators, no matter which party we belong to, \nto pass the best law we can. After all, that is what the American \npeople expect.\n  The vast majority of Americans are opposed to terrorism, terrorism of \nany sort, and they assume that their elected officials, both \nRepublicans and Democrats, are going to pass good anti-terrorism \nlegislation. If it takes a day or two more to get it right, then let us \ntake the day or two more. We are doing this for a nation of 250 million \nAmericans, a very powerful nation, threatened by terrorism.\n  The Senate passed S. 735 on June 6, 1995, almost a year ago. The \nHouse only considered its version last month. The conference committee \napparently met a couple of evenings ago, and we were handed the \nconference report yesterday with instructions to pass it post haste. \nHaving seen almost 10 months elapse since the Senate passed this bill, \nI hope we take time to at least to read the conference report. And, I \ndare suggest, there are not five Senators in here who have even read \nthe conference report or have the foggiest notion of what it is they \nare voting on.\n  This is what we are talking about. We are talking about a bill being \nrushed through here about antiterrorism, because we are all against \nterrorists. But I am willing to bet my farm in Middlesex, VT, you are \nnot going to find 5 to 10 Senators in this body who have read every \nword of this conference report.\n  In particular, my motion to recommit concerns profound changes to our \nasylum process that were not previously considered by the Senate in our \ndeliberations on antiterrorism last year. The provisions I am objecting \nto have nothing to do with preventing terrorism. That is one reason why \nthey were not in the antiterrorism bill that we considered and passed \nlast summer. These provisions were added in the conference.\n\n  They do not have to do with terrorism. I am asking only to strike \nsections 414, 422, and 423. These are general immigration matters. They \nshould be in the immigration bill. They should not be in this \nantiterrorism bill.\n  I tried to amend these provisions during the Judiciary Committee \nconsideration of the immigration bill. I failed\n\n[[Page S3428]]\n\non a tie vote. I circulated a ``Dear Colleague'' earlier this week, \nmaking clear my intention to try to change this. These provisions are \nbad policy. They are going to make bad law, and they are put in here \nfor the first time in a conference report.\n  I disagree as well with the habeas corpus sections of the conference \nreport, but at least we had the opportunity to debate and amend those \nprovisions. The asylum rewrite was done in the dark of the night and it \nis being forced on us today. I think that is wrong.\n  Look no further than the front page of the New York Times on Monday. \nYou see the most recent example of why we must not adopt the summary \nexclusion provision in the bill. There is an article on the case of \nFauziya Kasinga and her flight from Togo to avoid female genital \nmutilation. She has sought for 2 years to find sanctuary in this \ncountry, only to be detained, tear-gassed, beaten, isolated and \nabused--not in some distant land, but the United States of America. The \ncase has outraged women and men all over this country.\n  What you may not know is that the conference report that we have \nbefore us would summarily exclude Ms. Kasinga from ever having made an \nasylum claim, a claim that I hope, based on the reported facts, is \ngoing to be granted without her enduring more suffering. You see she \ntraveled from Germany coming to America, and traveled on a false \nBritish passport in order to escape mutilation in Togo.\n  Under the legislation before us, she would be out. ``Tough. Go back \nand get mutilated. We do not care. We have a law--that none of us ever \nsaw, none of us ever debated, none of us ever spent time on--that \nallows for your summary exclusion. You are out.''\n  Fidel Castro's daughter is another recent example of a refugee who \ncame here using a disguise and phony Spanish passport to seek asylum. \nShe came through Spain. Under the provisions of this bill, she might \nhave been turned away at the border after a summary interview by a low-\nlevel immigration officer. We all know that there are political reasons \nwhy Fidel Castro's daughter should be granted asylum. Under the \nprovisions of the conference report before us, slipped into the bill in \nthe middle of the night, are barriers that could make that impossible.\n  I yield myself 2 more minutes.\n  In my ``Dear Colleague'' letter on my proposed amendment to these \nsections in the immigration bill and in the additional views I filed \nwith the committee report on the immigration bill I also recall victims \nof the Holocaust and their use of false identification provided by the \nbrave diplomats Raoul Wallenberg and Chiune Sugihara during World War \nII. Think of Oskar Schindler, think of ``Schindler's List.'' These are \nthe kind of things that we need to consider before adopting this \nconference report.\n  My concern is not to defend alien smuggling or false documentation or \nterrorists, but to acknowledge that there are some circumstances and \noppressive regimes in the world where, if you are going to escape, you \nmay well need to rely on false papers.\n  It would be ironic if we were to pass these provisions on an \nantiterrorism bill that would prohibit victims of terror, torture, and \noppression around the world from seeking refuge in this, the world's \ngreatest democracy.\n  I hope that the United States will not abandon its historic role as a \nrefuge for the oppressed and persecuted. Our country is a beacon of \nhope and freedom, let it not be extinguished. Let us not abandon our \nleadership role in international human rights. Let us not abandon the \nworld's true refugees, let us not restrict the due process that \nprotects the people who look to us for asylum. Unfortunately, the \nimpact of the provisions in this bill would be to deny refugees any \nopportunity to claim political asylum and would, instead, summarily \nexclude them from the United States and send them back to their \npersecutors without a hearing, without due process protections, without \nassistance to help them describe their plight and without judicial \nreview of any kind.\n  Sections 421 and 422 of the conference report prohibit an asylum \nclaim by refugees who enter this country with false identification. I \ncould understand that we might want to consider as potentially relevant \nfactors to an asylum claim that the refugee arrived with false \ndocuments and the route that the refugee traveled to get here. But \nthose factors should not be dispositive. The examples to which I have \npreviously alluded indicate that there are times when the use of false \ndocumentation is not something that we would want to punish. I fear \nthat the bill goes too far and sends the wrong signal by putting the \nburden on the refugee, without counsel and in a summary proceeding, to \nestablish that the person is the exception and to create a clear record \nof ``credible fear'' and that it was necessary to present the false \ndocument to depart from the persecuting country.\n  The Committee to Preserve Asylum has sent each of us a letter \noutlining the ways in which similar provisions in the immigration bill \nwould harm human rights and endanger refugees. In their April 8 letter \nsupporting the Leahy amendment they outline cases in which these \nprovisions would have been disastrous.\n  The U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees sent our chairman a letter \ndated March 6 objecting to these provisions as inconsistent with the \n1967 Protocol Relating to the Status of Refugees and remains critical \nof the bill.\n  The asylum process was reorganized and reformed in January 1994. The \nbill fails to take these changes into account. In fact, in 1995 asylum \nclaims decreased greatly and were being timely processed. Only 20 \npercent were granted. Thus, the bill's provisions are a bad solution in \nsearch of a problem. The INS and Department of Justice report that they \nhave matters in hand.\n  The Department of Justice counsels that we should allow immigration \njudges rather than asylum officers to make these determinations. Under \nthe circumstances, I believe that we have moved too far too fast and \nallowed a few cases from the distant past to create bad law.\n  The asylum provisions in the bill would place undue burdens on \nunsophisticated refugees who are truly in need of sanctuary but may not \nbe able to explain their situation to an overworked asylum officer. The \nbill would establish summary exclusion procedures and invest low-level \nimmigration officers with unprecedented authority to deport refugees \nwithout allowing them a fair opportunity to establish a valid claim to \nasylum. Even before being permitted to apply for asylum, refugees who \nflee persecution without valid documents, would be met with a series of \nprocedural hurdles virtually impossible to understand or overcome.\n  This is a radical departure from current procedures that afford an \nasylum hearing before an immigration judge during which an applicant \nmay be represented by counsel, may cross-examined and present \nwitnesses, and after which review is available by the Board of \nImmigration Appeals. Such hearings have been vitally important to \nrefugees who may face torture, imprisonment or death as a result of an \ninitial, erroneous decision by an INS official. Indeed, human rights \norganizations have documented a number of cases of people who were \nultimately granted political asylum by immigration judges after the INS \ndenied their release from INS detention for not meeting a ``credible \nfear'' standard. Under the summary screening proposed in the bill \nconference report, these refugees would have been sent back to their \npersecutors without an opportunity for a hearing.\n  Under international law, an individual may be denied an opportunity \nto prove an asylum claim only if the claim is ``manifestly unfounded.'' \nThis bill would establish a summary screening mechanism that utilizes a \n``credible fear'' standard without meaning or precedent in \ninternational law. These summary exclusion provisions have been \ncriticized by international human rights organizations and the United \nNations High Commissioner for Refugees.\n  Furthermore, the proposed legislation would deny the Federal courts \ntheir historic role in overseeing the implementation of our immigration \nlaws and review of individual administrative decisions. The bill would \nallow no judicial review whether a person is actually excludable. These \nproposals thereby portent a fundamental change in the role of our \ncoordinate branches of Government and a dangerous precedent.\n\n[[Page S3429]]\n\n  Besides being fundamentally unfair to a traumatized and fatigued \nrefugee, who would be allowed no assistance and no interpreter, the \nproposed summary screening process would impose a burdensome and costly \ndiversion of INS resources. In 1995 for example, only 3,287 asylum \nseekers arrived without valid documents--hardly the tens of thousands \npurported to justify these changes. The bill would require that a \nphalanx of specially trained asylum officers be created and posted at \nairports, sea ports and other ports of entry across the country to be \navailable to conduct summary screening at the border. There is simply \nno need to divert these resources in this way when the asylum process \nhas already been brought under control.\n  There are no exigent circumstances that require this Nation to turn \nits back on its traditional role as a refuge from oppression and to \nresort to summary exclusion processes. Neither the Department of \nJustice nor the INS support these provisions or believe them necessary.\n  I urge my colleagues to reject this gutting of our asylum laws and \nsupport the motion to recommit.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum and ask \nunanimous consent that it not be charged to my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The clerk \nwill call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, regarding the motion to recommit the \nconference report by the distinguished Senator from Vermont, now, look, \nthis bill is a tough bipartisan measure. Stated simply, it is a \nlandmark piece of legislation. My colleagues on the other side of the \naisle know it. We have crafted a bill that puts the Nation's interests \nabove partisan politics.\n  Some of my colleagues however have criticized this bill for not being \ntough enough on terrorists. In truth, many oppose this bill because it \nis too tough on vicious, convicted murderers--not my friend from \nVermont, but others. My colleagues are aware that this motion to \nrecommit will not improve the bill. Instead, if it passes it will \nscuttle the antiterrorism bill. In other words, it will kill it.\n  Accordingly, on behalf of Senator Dole and myself, I move to table \nthe pending motion and ask for the yeas and nays.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, would the Senator withhold just a moment?\n  Mr. HATCH. I will be happy to withhold.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, as I understand it, we are under a time \nagreement. Such a motion would not be in order until--or at least a \nvote on such a motion would not be in order until all time is either \nused or yielded back. Am I correct?\n  Mr. HATCH. I thought maybe the Senator had used his time.\n  I withdraw my request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The motion would not be in order until the \ntime is used or yielded back.\n  Mr. LEAHY. If the Senator asks unanimous consent to make his motion \nto get the yeas and nays on it now, to be done at the expiration of \ntime or yielding back----\n  Mr. HATCH. We can wait until then.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, would the Senator yield further, on my \ntime?\n  Mr. HATCH. I certainly do.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a letter from \nthe Committee to Preserve Asylum and various attachments in support of \nmy amendment, signed by the American Friends Service Committee, the \nAmerican Jewish Committee, Amnesty International, Associated Catholic \nCharities of New Orleans, Jesuit Social Ministries, Jewish Federation \nof Metropolitan Chicago, Indian Law Resource Center, and a number of \nothers in support of my amendment be included in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                 Committee to Preserve Asylum,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, April 8, 1996.\n     Hon. Patrick J. Leahy,\n     Russell Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Leahy: We are an ad hoc coalition of religious \n     groups, human rights organizations, concerned physicians, and \n     immigration and civil rights advocates that have come \n     together to oppose the new bars to applying for asylum \n     contained in S. 269.\n       The right to seek asylum is an internationally recognized \n     human right, incorporated into U.S. law by Congress in the \n     1980 Refugee Act. It protects individuals fleeing persecution \n     on account of race, religion, nationality, political opinion, \n     or membership in a particular social group. Each year the \n     U.S. grants asylum to about 8,000 people, less than 1% of \n     legal immigrants. The new bars to asylum contained in S. 269, \n     the Immigration Control and Financial Responsibility Act, \n     would seriously undermine human rights protections for these \n     bona fide refugees.\n       The new bars to asylum, found in sections 133 and 193 of \n     the bill, would give low level immigration officers the \n     authority to exclude and deport without a fair hearing \n     refugees who were forced to flee persecution without valid \n     travel documents. For reasons illustrated in the attached \n     documents, this section would effectively deny asylum to many \n     human rights victims. It will also cost more money.

The new bars to asylum would \n     punish people whose only means of fleeing repressive \n     governments is by using invalid travel documents.\n       Many true refugees are forced to flee persecution without \n     valid travel documents either\n\n[[Page S3430]]\n\n     because they do not have time to acquire them or because \n     applying for them would threaten their lives.\n       Under current law, a person who arrives in the United \n     States without valid travel documents and fears persecution \n     in his or her home country may go before an immigration judge \n     and prove eligibility for asylum. The asylum seeker may be \n     represented at the hearing at no cost to the government.\n       The new bars to asylum would preclude such a person from \n     even applying for asylum until he or she has proven that he \n     or she has a ``credible fear'' of persecution and used the \n     invalid travel documents to flee directly from a country \n     where there is a ``significant danger'' of being returned to \n     persecution. This all may have to be proven immediately after \n     a stressful journey, and without the assistance of counsel or \n     an interpreter, and without the involvement of any judicial \n     or quasi-judicial officer.\n       The new bars and summary procedures are problematic for \n     several reasons.\n       A ``false papers'' rule would harm human rights victims. By \n     definition, asylum seekers frequently fear persecution by the \n     government of their home country--the same government that \n     issues travel documents and checks identity papers and exit \n     permits at the airports and border crossings. It should be \n     recalled that the United States has long honored Raoul \n     Wallenberg, who saved countless lives during the Holocaust by \n     issuing unofficial travel documents so that refugees could \n     flee further persecution.\n       Meritorious asylum seekers would be returned to \n     persecution. The INS has made serious errors while trying to \n     apply the ``credible fear'' test. Under current law, asylum \n     seekers who arrive in the U.S. without valid travel documents \n     are detained pending their hearing unless they prove a \n     ``credible fear'' of persecution in their home country. Human \n     rights organizations have documented many cases in which \n     people were denied parole under this standard, but later were \n     granted asylum at their hearing before an immigration judge. \n     Under the new bars to asylum, they would have been returned \n     to persecution. A summary of some of these case studies is \n     attached.\n       The Department of Justice opposes the new bars to asylum. \n     Deputy Attorney General Jamie Gorelick wrote in her February \n     14 letter to Judiciary Committee Chairman Orrin G. Hatch that \n     the Justice Department opposes sections 133/193, noting that \n     ``Absent smuggling or an extraordinary migration situation, \n     we can handle asylum applications for excludable aliens under \n     our regular procedures.''\n       The new bars would deny protection to refugees who had to \n     change planes on route to the United States. Before being \n     able to apply for asylum, a refugee who used false documents \n     would have to prove that they were needed to leave her \n     country or to transit through another country. This \n     requirement would prejudice both asylum seekers who flee \n     countries that do not have direct carrier routes to the U.S. \n     and those who must travel over land through countries that do \n     not have asylum laws, that may be friendly with the \n     government they are fleeing, or that are hostile to people of \n     their background or nationality. Refugees from Asian and \n     African countries in particular face this situation.\n       The new bars to asylum are inconsistent with U.s. \n     obligations under international law and will inevitably lead \n     to errors. The new bars lack the minimal procedural \n     safeguards to prevent the mistaken return of a genuine \n     refugee to certain persecution. The UNHCR ``fears that many \n     bona fide refugees will be returned to countries where their \n     lives or freedom will be threatened'' if the new bars to \n     asylum become law. (Letter to Sen. Hatch, Chairman Judiciary \n     Cmte, March 6, 1996).\n\n\n                      vote for the leahy amendment\n\n       Bob, a student at the University of Khartoum in Sudan, was \n     an active member of the Democratic Unionist Party, an anti-\n     government organization. After participating in a peaceful \n     student protest, he was arrested by the Sudanese government. \n     He was detained in a 6 by 11 foot cell with 10 other \n     prisoners for 2 months. During his imprisonment, he was \n     repeatedly interrogated and tortured--he was hung by his \n     hands and feet, beaten and electrically shocked. As a result \n     of the torture, his elbows are permanently deformed. He \n     remained active in the democratic movement after his release \n     from prison. Then, as he was walking to a democratic union \n     meeting, he was again arrested and imprisoned. A few months \n     later, while he was still in prison, he suffered a nervous \n     breakdown because of the torture he suffered. He was \n     transferred to a hospital, but remained under arrest. Wearing \n     a nurse's uniform that his mother had smuggled into the \n     hospital, Bob escaped from imprisonment.\n       Bob's colleagues from the democratic union smuggled him \n     onto a freighter bound for Germany. In Germany, he borrowed \n     another person's ID card to leave the ship. Knowing that the \n     anti-immigration and NeoNazi movement in Germany had \n     heightened and that it would be impossible to receive asylum \n     there, Bob flew from Germany to the United States. He arrived \n     without a passport. When he exited the plane, he immediately \n     told the INS that he wanted to apply for asylum. He was \n     placed in detention. Bob was not released from detention \n     because the INS interviewer determined he did not have a \n     ``credible fear'' of persecution. He was granted asylum by an \n     immigration judge.\n       Alan, an Indian national, had been persecuted in Kashmir \n     because of his religion. On several occasions, he and his \n     family members were imprisoned and tortured by the Indian \n     government. In July 1994 when the military police sought to \n     detain him, he evaded arrest. A few months later his family's \n     home was bombed.\n       Fearing for his life, Alan fled to the United States using \n     a false passport. He told the INS he wanted asylum \n     immediately. He explained to the INS officials that he and \n     his family had been persecuted by the Indian government. The \n     INS officers at the airport did not think he was credible. \n     The officials verbally abused Alan and denied him food and \n     water until he was brought to a detention center the next \n     day. Alan was not released from detention because the INS did \n     not think he had a credible fear of persecution even though \n     he presented the INS with reports about religious persecution \n     in Kashmir. Alan was later granted asylum by an immigration \n     judge.\n       Sam, a Nigerian national, was an active member of a pro-\n     democracy organization that was determined to ensure \n     democratic elections in Nigeria. Shortly before the \n     elections, the leader of the democracy organization was found \n     murdered, and several members were arrested and subsequently \n     disappeared. The State Secret Service went to Sam's house on \n     election day searching for him. When Sam learned that the \n     secret service was searching for him, he immediately went \n     into hiding, afraid that if they found him, he too would \n     ``disappear'' as his colleagues had.\n       Sam fled to the United States right out of hiding. He \n     changed planes in Amsterdam. He traveled with a false U.S. \n     passport. He was afraid that the Nigerian government would \n     arrest him if he tried to leave the country with his own \n     identification papers. When he arrived in the United States, \n     he immediately told the INS that he wanted asylum. He was \n     placed in detention. The INS interviewed him to determine \n     whether he had a credible fear of persecution; the INS \n     concluded that he did not. He was granted asylum by a federal \n     court.\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I also ask unanimous consent that a letter \nfrom the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees in support be included in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                                   United Nations,\n\n\n                               High Commissioner for Refugees,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, March 19, 1996.\n     Re Special Exclusion Provisions of S. 269.\n     Hon. Patrick Leahy,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Leahy: I wish to express UNHCR's sincere \n     appreciation for your efforts during the 14 March Judiciary \n     Committee mark-up session to remove the special exclusion \n     provisions of S. 269. These provisions, found in Sections \n     133, 141 and 193 of the bill, would almost certainly result \n     in the U.S. returning bona fide refugees to countries where \n     their lives or freedom would be threatened.\n       As noted in my 6 March letter to Judiciary Committee \n     Chairman Orrin Hatch, we offer our views regarding S. 269 \n     with the hope that you and the other members of the Judiciary \n     Committee will seek to adhere to the standards and principles \n     set forth in the 1967 Protocol Relating to the Status of \n     Refugees, to which the U.S. acceded in 1968.\n       In particular, UNHCR is concerned with the following \n     special exclusion provisions:\n       (1) Lack of due process--Sections 133, 141 and 193 provide \n     few procedural safeguards to ensure that true refugees are \n     not erroneously returned to persecution.\n       (a) No administrative review--Under Section 141, special \n     exclusion orders are not subject to administrative review (p. \n     IB-4, line 19). Minimum procedural guidelines for refugee \n     status determinations specify that an applicant should be \n     given a reasonable time to appeal for a formal \n     reconsideration of the decision. This principle is set forth \n     in UNHCR Executive Committee Conclusion No. 8 (1977).\\1\\ The \n     ``prompt supervisory review'' provided for in Section 193 (p. \n     IC-36, line 12) does not meet these minimum procedural \n     guidelines.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n     \\1\\ The UNHCR Executive Committee is a group of \n     representatives from 50 countries, including the United \n     States, that provides policy and guidance to UNHCR in the \n     exercise of its refugee protection mandate.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n       (b) Limitation on access to counsel--Under Section 193, \n     asylum-seekers arriving at US ports of entry with false \n     documents or no documents are permitted to consult with a \n     person of their choosing, only if such consultation does \n     ``not delay the process'' (p. IC-36, line 25). Such a \n     limitation is in violation of the principle that applicants \n     for asylum should be given the necessary facilities for \n     submitting his/her case to the authorities, including the \n     services of a competent interpreter and the opportunity to \n     contact a representative of UNHCR (UNHCR Executive Committee \n     Conclusion No. 8 (1977)).\n       (2) Limitation on access to asylum--Section 193 provides \n     that individuals presenting false or no documents or who are \n     escorted to the US from a vessel at sea are not permitted to \n     apply for asylum unless they traveled to the US from a \n     country of claimed persecution and that the false document\n\n[[Page S3431]]\n\n     used, if any, was necessary to depart from the country of \n     claimed persecution. UNHCR requests the US to remove this \n     limitation and to adhere to international principles which \n     provide as follows:\n       (a) ``[A]sylum should not be refused solely on the ground \n     that it could be sought from another State. Where, however, \n     it appears that a person, before requesting asylum, already \n     has a connexion or close links with another State, he may if \n     it appears fair and reasonable be called upon first to \n     request asylum from that State'' (UNHCR Executive Committee \n     Conclusion No. 15 (1979) (emphasis added)).\n       (b) When refugees and asylum-seekers move in an irregular \n     manner (without proper documentation) from a country where \n     they have already found protection, they may be returned to \n     that country if, in addition to being protected against \n     refoulement (i.e. protected against return to a country where \n     their lives or freedom would be threatened), they are treated \n     in accordance with ``recognized basic human standards'' \n     (UNHCR Executive Committee Conclusion No. 58 (1989)). UNHCR \n     is prepared to assist in practical arrangement for the \n     readmission and reception of such persons, consistent with \n     these international standards.\n       (3) Credible fear standard--Sections 133, 141 and 193 \n     create a new, heightened threshold standard that asylum-\n     seekers must meet before they are permitted to present their \n     claims in a hearing before an immigration judge. Under these \n     sections, asylum-seekers who are brought or escorted to the \n     US from a vessel at sea (Sections 133 and 141), who have \n     entered the US without inspection, but have not resided in \n     the US for two years or more (Section 141), who arrive during \n     an ``extraordinary migration situation'' (Section 141) or who \n     arrive at a port of entry with false documents or no \n     documents (Section 193) must first establish a ``credible \n     fear'' of persecution before they are permitted to present \n     their claims in an asylum hearing before an immigration \n     judge. UNHCR urges the adoption of a ``manifestly unfounded'' \n     or ``clearly abusive'' standard which would reduce the risk \n     that a bona fide refugee is erroneously returned to a country \n     where s/he has a well-founded fear of persecution. This \n     international standard for expeditious refugee status \n     determinations is set forth in UNHCR Executive Committee \n     Conclusion No. 30 (1983).\n       We are hopeful that you will support the elimination of a \n     deadline for filing asylum applications. Failure to submit a \n     request within a certain time limit should not lead to an \n     asylum request being excluded from consideration (UNHCR \n     Executive Committee Conclusion No. 15 (1979)). Under this \n     international principle, the US is obliged to protect \n     refugees from return to danger regardless of whether a filing \n     deadline has been met.\n       Again, I thank you for your efforts to ensure that refugees \n     are protected from return to countries of persecution. Please \n     do not hesitate to contact my Office if UNHCR may be of any \n     further assistance to you, your staff or other members of the \n     Committee.\n           Sincerely,\n                                            Anne Willem Bijleveld,\n                                                   Representative.\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am not in any way trying to derail this \nbill. I am just saying that this is something that was tucked into it \nin the middle of the night. Nobody ever had a chance to debate it. It \nis in here. And it is going to make it impossible, or nearly \nimpossible, for anyone from Fidel Castro's sister to somebody escaping \ntorture and religious persecution to come to the United States, if \ntraveling through a second country or traveling with a false passport \nto do it.\n  That makes no sense. That is not an antiterrorist situation. Look at \n``Schindler's List.'' Remember Raoul Wallenberg. Think about those who \nescaped persecution by using false passports as a way they could get \nout of the country. They may well have to go through an intermediate \ncountry to get to the greatest nation of freedom on Earth. Just because \nsomebody slipped these provisions into the conference report, let us \nnot go along with it. This is something that should be debated.\n  Our own Department of Justice does not support these provisions of \nthe bill. I think in fact the Justice Department reiterated their \nopposition to them in an April 16 letter on similar provisions in the \nimmigration bill to the majority leader. Deputy Attorney General \nGorelick wrote us, ``absent smuggling or an extraordinary migration \nsituation, we can handle asylum applications for excludable aliens \nunder our regular procedures.''\n  I reserve the balance of my time and yield to the Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I do not really have anything more to say \nother than this is a very important piece of legislation. It is a key \npiece of legislation. It is desired by almost everybody who wants to do \nanything against terrorism. It is effective and strong. Even though we \nacknowledge we do not have everything everybody wants in this bill, it \nis a darn good bill that will make a real difference. If this motion or \nany motion to recommit passes, this bill is dead, it will be killed. So \nwe simply have to defeat any and all motions to recommit. I will move \nto table the amendment at the appropriate time. I am prepared to yield \nback the balance of my time on this amendment.\n  Mr. BIDEN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from \nDelaware.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, the Senator from Utah, the distinguished \nchairman of the committee, keeps referencing that----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator from Vermont yield time to \nthe Senator from Delaware?\n  Mr. LEAHY. Yes. I understand I have about 4 minutes. I yield 2 \nminutes to the Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, the Senator from Utah keeps saying anything \nwill kill this bill. That is not true. This is not ``kill this bill.'' \nIf we send this back to conference for one or two or 12 amendments it \ndoes not kill this bill. Every major bill we had, including the crime \nbill, we sent back to conference with instructions--at least on three \noccasions. This will not kill this bill.\n  Some of this has not been well thought out. Much of what we left out \nof the bill, I am convinced, on reconsideration by our friends in the \nHouse, they would change their view. But I want to make it clear, I do \nnot believe there is any evidence to suggest that sending this back to \nconference with specific instructions would kill the bill.\n  I am prepared, if the chairman and if Senator Leahy is, to yield \nback. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LEAHY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Does the Senator from California care to speak on this?\n  Mrs. BOXER. No. I am waiting for the next motion.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I thought Senator Kennedy wished to speak \non this.\n  I am ready to yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. HATCH. I am prepared to yield back the balance of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has been yielded back.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the pending \nLeahy motion to recommit be temporarily set aside with the vote to \noccur on or in relation to the Leahy motion after completion of debate \non the next motion to recommit.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HATCH. Senators should be aware there will be two consecutive \nrollcall votes following completion of all debate on the next motion.\n  Mr. President, I also ask unanimous consent to move to table the \nLeahy amendment and ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There appears to \nbe.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. BIDEN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from \nDelaware.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, for the benefit of my colleagues, to review \nthe bidding from yesterday, the distinguished chairman of the committee \nand I agreed on a unanimous-consent proposal that we have one-half hour \non each of up to as many as 14 motions. I doubt there will be that \nmany. But we will move them out seriatim here. I see my distinguished \ncolleague from California, Senator Boxer, is on the floor prepared to \ngo with her motion, to begin to debate her motion. So I would, with the \npermission of the Senator from Utah, yield to the Senator from \nCalifornia for that purpose.\n  I will make one important point, Mr. President. At the appropriate \ntime I will make the motion. As I understand the parliamentary \nsituation, debate must be concluded before I make the motion, otherwise \nthe motion is subject to immediately being tabled, which I do not think \nmy friend has any\n\n[[Page S3432]]\n\nintention of doing. But just to make sure we do it by the numbers--I \nbeg your pardon. I have been informed by staff we got unanimous consent \nyesterday that that is not necessary, that we can offer the motion. But \nI will offer the motion at this point.\n\n\n                           Motion To Recommit\n\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I offer a motion to recommit the conference \nreport with instructions to add provisions on the National Firearms Act \nstatute of limitations. For the purpose of discussion of that motion, I \nsend that motion to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The motion is now pending.\n  The motion is as follows:\n\n       Motion to recommit the conference report on the bill S. 735 \n     to the committee of conference with instructions to the \n     managers on the part of the Senate to disagree to the \n     conference substitute recommended by the committee of \n     conference and insist on inserting the following:\n\n     SEC.   . INCREASED PERIODS OF LIMITATION FOR NATIONAL \n                   FIREARMS ACT VIOLATIONS.\n\n       Section 6531 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 is \n     amended--\n       (1) by redesignating paragraphs (1) through (8) as \n     subparagraphs (A) through (H), respectively; and\n       (2) by amending the matter immediately preceding \n     subparagraph (A), as redesignated, to read as follows: ``No \n     person shall be prosecuted, tried, or punished for any \n     criminal offense under the internal revenue laws unless the \n     indictment is found or the information instituted not later \n     than 3 years after the commission of the offense, except that \n     the period of limitation shall be--\n       ``(1) 5 years for offenses described in section 5861 \n     (relating to firearms and other devices); and\n       ``(2) 6 years--.''.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There will be 30 minutes equally divided. Who \nyields time?\n  Mr. BIDEN. I thank the Chair for its assistance. I yield as much time \nas the Senator from California may need under my control.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from \nCalifornia.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Thank you, Mr. President. I want to thank the Senator \nfrom Delaware for taking the leadership on this issue. Every motion \nthat he will make today is a motion that is tough on crime. Every \nsingle motion that he will make, if it is carried by this U.S. Senate, \nwill make this a better bill.\n  The motion that he just sent to the desk means a lot to the Senator \nfrom California because I offered it to this U.S. Senate. It was \nadopted unanimously. I have to say, it is inexplicable to me why this \nprovision would have been stricken. I do know there are certain groups \nthat oppose it, one in particular, the NRA. I cannot for the life of me \nunderstand why else this would have been stricken from the Senate bill.\n  Let me explain the amendment that I offered which is the subject of \nthis motion. What we would do is simply make sure that under the \nNational Firearms Act when there is a crime which deals with making a \nbomb, making a silencer, making a sawed-off shotgun, that there be a \nperiod of time of 5 years rather than 3 years for law enforcement to \ntrack down and prosecute the criminal who would commit such a crime.\n  There is an anomaly in the United States Code right now. These crimes \nare the only ones that have a 3-year statute of limitations. Let me \nexplain why this is so bad and why we must fix it. If there is a crime \nwhere a terrorist makes a bomb and the bomb explodes and it kills \npeople--and we have just, of course, revisited, as our President did, \nthe tragedy in Oklahoma City, and the 1-year anniversary of that \ndreadful day is coming quickly upon us--if a criminal had a bomb in his \nhome or in his farmhouse or in his truck or hidden away for a period of \na year, let us say, while he made that bomb, the statute of limitations \nstarts running from the day the bomb is made. In such a case law \nenforcement would have only 2 years to track down and put away such a \ncriminal.\n  I do not understand why those who claim to be tough on crime would \ndrop from this bill a commonsense provision. Striking this provision \nmakes it easier to get away with making a bomb. It is that simple.\n  Who supports this Boxer amendment? How did I even learn about it? I \nlearned about it from local law enforcement people who asked me to \nfight this fight. I learned about it from the Justice Department, who \nasked us to carry this fight. I learned about it from the Treasury \nDepartment, which heads the ATF, and they asked me to fight for this. \nMr. President, 47 police chiefs told me to fight for this. For them, I \noffered this amendment to establish a 5-year statute of limitations for \nmaking a bomb, a sawed-off shotgun, or a silencer. It is pretty \nstraightforward.\n  I think the American people understand this, and people can stand up \nhere as long as they want, and I have respect for them. However, I must \nquestion them when stand up here and say, ``Well, gee, Senator Boxer, \nif we kept your amendment in here, this whole bill would go down.'' \nShow me one U.S. Senator of either party, show me one House Member who \nwould truly stand up and say that a criminal who makes a bomb, who \nmakes a silencer, who makes a sawed-off shotgun should get away with it \nbecause of a 3-year statute of limitations. If any disparity is \nwarranted, bomb making ought to be a longer statute, because a bomb \ncould be hidden in somebody's possession for a long time before it was \ndetonated and before it was used.\n  The police chief of Oklahoma City supports this. Let me repeat that: \nThe police chief of Oklahoma City supports this amendment. They know \nthey need time to put together their case.\n  What are we doing here? Are we doing the bidding of the NRA, or are \nwe doing the bidding of the American people? Are we trying to protect \nthe people from these vicious crimes, these cowardly crimes? It is \nhorrible enough when someone walks up to someone else and injures them \nwith a weapon. That is a horrible crime and it should be punishable by \nthe worst possible punishment.\n  It is unbelievable to me that this was stricken by this conference \ncommittee. I thought we were going to be tough on crime.\n  Last night, a simple proposal that would say if a chemical weapon was \nused, local law enforcement could call on our military to get help was \ndefeated in this Republican Senate--defeated. Now, ask the average law \nenforcement person in the local community if they are experts on \nchemical and biological weapons. They will tell you no. Just as in my \namendment, if you ask them, do you need more time to go after the \ncowards that would make a bomb, they would say, ``We need more time, \nSenator. Fight for your amendment.'' We did, and it passed this Senate, \nand it was dropped in conference. It comes back to us with this piece \nmissing.\n  I am stunned that would be the case. There is no argument except the \none that the distinguished chairman makes over and over again on each \nof these motions which is, ``You know that your amendment, Senator, \nwill kill this bill.'' Well, I do not know that. I never got one \nletter, one note of opposition to this commonsense proposal supported \nby the police chief of Oklahoma City and all the other law enforcement \npeople who know it takes time to put together these complex cases.\n  I say if anyone believes this is bad policy, if they disagree with me \non substance, if they disagree with the police chief of Oklahoma City \nand all the other police chiefs, the Justice Department and the \nadministration, why do they not come down here? I say if they agree \nthat it is common sense that altogether these crimes should have a \nminimum of a 5-year statute of limitations, they should support the \nBiden motion to recommit.\n  It defies imagination that we are now here refighting important \ncommonsense proposals included in the Senate version of this bill.\n  I hope that my Republican friends will support this motion. I think \nit is absolutely key that we not tie the hands of law enforcement. We \nare coming to the 1-year anniversary of Oklahoma City. We know the \ninvestigation is going on and is continuing. If you asked every \nAmerican, no matter what political stripe, no matter what part of the \ncountry they are from, they would say that it is important to give law \nenforcement enough time to investigate these complex cases--that is all \nwe are asking for. This does not cost any money. It simply gives law \nenforcement time, time to make sure that they have completed their \ninvestigation and those cowards who would blow\n\n[[Page S3433]]\n\nup innocent people are put away and dealt with in the harshest possible \nfashion.\n  I say that is being tough on crime. I hope that we will have support \nfor this motion to recommit. Mr. President, I yield the floor. I \nreserve whatever time I might have.\n  Mr. HATCH addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I will not take long because, frankly, it \ncomes down to one thing: that we have worked this bill out. We have \nworked hard with the House Members. It has been very difficult to do. \nThey have made significant concessions to us, and rightfully so. We \napplaud them for doing so because we have our problems here, and they \nhave their problems there.\n  Anybody who has been in this process very long understands that once \nyou reach a conference report like this--especially this one, which has \ntaken a year to get here--any change is going to kill the bill--\nespecially this provision.\n  Section 108 of the Senate bill, in part, would increase from 3 to 5 \nyears the limitations period for commencing actions for violations of \nthe National Firearms Act. The reason it is opposed by Members of the \nHouse, and the reason I oppose this attempt to increase the limitations \nprovision, simply put, is because it is unnecessary. It does absolutely \nnothing with regard to terrorism. The 3-year Internal Revenue Code \nstatute of limitation period for licensed firearms dealers violating \nthe National Firearms Act is more than an adequate time to commence \nprosecutions.\n  There is no sanguine reason to extend the period. This has nothing to \ndo with terrorism. It may be a good idea in another context, but it is \napparent that it would cause plenty of problems in this context because \nthere are simply people in the House--and I suspect here--who disagree \nwith the distinguished Senator from California, who is very sincere in \nputting this amendment forward.\n  The statute of limitations period should be built upon fairness. \nThese types of statutes of limitation must protect the Government's \nability to prosecute claims and violations of the law. Yet, they also \nhave to protect citizenry from stale claims and bureaucratic abuse. In \nthis area there are a significant number of people on both sides of the \nfloor here, and in the House of Representatives in particular, who have \nseen unfairness by various bureaucratic abusers and do not want to \nchange this.\n  The traditional 3-year limitations period here accomplishes this fine \nbalance between public needs and private rights. If we look at the \nunderlying National Firearms Act offenses subject to a 3-year \nlimitations period, the violations either prohibit dealers from \npossessing or transferring illegal firearms, such as banned machine \nguns or sawed-off shotguns, or possessing or transferring them without \nthe proper firearm identification serial numbers, or through fraudulent \napplications or records. The 3-year limitations period, historically, \nhas been more than sufficient to prosecute claims under the act, some \nbeing substantive but many of an administrative or of a paperwork \nnature. Some are technical. And we have seen abuses. Extending the \nlimitations period to 5 years does absolutely nothing except perhaps \nopen the system up to abuse and unfairness. Frankly, that is why our \ncolleagues in the House are against this amendment. That is why I am \nagainst it here today.\n  I am prepared to yield, and I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I yield myself 2 minutes of what I \nunderstand to be 5 minutes of remaining time.\n  The idea, of course, here, Mr. President, is that the proposal that \nis in the bill, the failure to do this in the bill does not make sense. \nListen to some of the types of weapons covered. Poison gas, bombs, \ngrenades, rockets having propellant charges of more than 4 ounces, \nmissiles having an explosive or incendiary charge of more than one-\nquarter ounce, mines--these are not playthings we are talking about. \nRemember, the statute of limitations runs not from the time the crime \nbecomes public knowledge, but from the time the crime was committed. So \nif a terrorist builds a bomb secretly, keeps it in his barn for 2\\1/2\\ \nyears, and blows up a building with it, the Federal prosecutors only \nhave 6 months to track the guy down and get an indictment for building \nthat bomb.\n\n  Crimes covered by the National Firearms Act are serious. They involve \nillegal manufacture of rockets, bombs, missiles, and sawed-off \nshotguns. So I cannot understand why anybody would oppose bringing the \nstatute of limitations for these crimes into line with almost every \nother Federal crime.\n  Here are a few examples of crimes with a 5-year statute: Simple \nassault; stealing a car; impersonating a Federal employee; buying \ncontraband cigarettes; impersonating, without authority, the character \nSmokey the Bear. If we are going to give the Government 5 years to \ntrack down a guy who impersonates Smokey the Bear, why not track down a \nguy who is involved in producing poison gas in his garage or barn?\n  I yield the remainder of my time to the Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I say to the Senator from Delaware that, \nas usual, he has put this in exactly the right manner. There is no \nreason on God's green Earth why this should not have been kept in this \nbill. Again, just ask the American people. Sometimes things sound very \ncomplicated. When the Senator from Utah got up and discussed the law, \nhe makes it sound too complicated for the average person to understand. \nWhen you tell the average person that if you get out there and \nimpersonate Smokey the Bear, law enforcement has 5 years to track you \ndown, prosecute you, and put you away, but if you make a bomb, they \nhave 3 years, it makes no sense whatsoever.\n  When the Senator from Utah says I am very sincere, I appreciate that. \nHe knows me and he knows that I am, and I know that he is as well. But \nthis is not about my sincerity. This is about a tool that law \nenforcement has asked the Congress to give them. So in the remainder of \nmy time, I am going to read into the Record the local police chiefs who \nhave asked us to give them this tool. It does not cost any money and \ndoes not set up a new bureaucracy. It gives them a commodity they want: \ntime. So I am going to read, in the time that remains, the people who \nsaid to me, ``Senator, this is important. Let us get this statute of \nlimitations extended so we can go after these bad, cowardly criminals \nand put them away.''\n  The police chiefs of San Jose, CA; San Francisco, CA; Berkeley, CA; \nLos Angeles Port, CA; Salinas, CA; San Leandro, CA; Indianapolis, IN; \nthe police chief of Oklahoma City, OK; the director of police in \nRoanoke, VA; the chiefs of police in Bladensburg, MD; Edwardsville, IL; \nRock Hill, SC; Old Saybrook, CT; North Little Rock, AR; Puyallup, WA; \nYarmouth, ME; Kinnelton, NJ; Bel Ridge, St. Louis, MO; Charleston, SC; \nJackson, MS; Salem, MA; Scottsdale, AZ; Cambridge, MA; Haverhill, MA; \nMillvale, Pittsburgh, PA; Newport News, VA; Dekalb County Police, \nDecatur, GA; Opelousas, LA; Eugene, OR; Mobile, AL; Portland, OR; East \nChicago, IN; Louisville, KY; Alexandria, VA; Renton, WA; Waukegan, IL; \nPort St. Lucie, FL; Greensboro, NC; Miami, FL; Buffalo, NY; Oxnard, CA; \nSeattle, WA.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator from California has \nexpired.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Thank you. I hope people will listen to the local chiefs \nand support the motion of the Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, look, if the Senator's arguments are valid, \nwhy do we not make it a 100-year statute of limitations? I mean, we can \nmake it that way. They can prosecute any time they want to prosecute.\n  The fact of the matter is that we are trying to balance our law \nenforcement needs. Most of these are paperwork violations that are \ngoing to be automatically ascertained within a very short period of \ntime, certainly within 3 years. If we make it 5 years, they will wait \n4\\1/2\\ years before prosecuting on a paperwork violation rather than \n2\\1/2\\ years, which is sometimes the case now.\n  There is simply no reason to extend the statute of limitations for \nthis act. Anyone who uses a bomb, as is the illustration by the Senator \nfrom California, or illegal weapon, under this act,\n\n[[Page S3434]]\n\nwill be prosecuted under the Criminal Code and receive far larger \npenalties than are under this act. The majority of these offenses are \nmere paperwork offenses and have little or nothing to do with \nterrorism. Essentially, it would permit bureaucrats, like I say, 4\\1/2\\ \nyears to start an investigation instead of 2\\1/2\\ years. That is really \nsometimes what happens.\n\n  Let us get back to where we were; that is, that we have arrived at a \ncompromise here, and we have had to bring the House a long distance to \nmeet the needs of the Senate. They have cooperated and have worked \nhard. Chairman Hyde and the other members of the conference have all \nworked very hard on this, and this is where we are. There are those on \nboth sides of the floor over there who do not like this amendment, and, \nfrankly, it would be a deal killer and a bill killer. If we want an \nantiterrorism bill, we have to vote down this motion to recommit.\n  I am prepared to yield the remainder of my time.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Grams). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BIDEN addressed the Chair.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I yield 60 seconds of my time to the \ndistinguished Senator from Delaware.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I would like to make two very brief points.\n  I do not believe this is a deal killer, No. 1. But No. 2, there are \ntwo pieces here. It is illegal to make a bomb. It is illegal to put \ntogether poison gas. That is one crime all by itself. The second crime \nis if you go out and use it. So, if you used a bomb to blow up \nbuildings, a new statute of limitations starts to run.\n  There is a distinction between what is lacking in this bill across \nthe board, between prevention and apprehension. We not only want to get \nthe bad guys who do the bad things; we want to prevent the bad guys \nfrom being able to do the bad things. By allowing the statute of \nlimitations to be like it is for Smokey the Bear impersonation, and \neverything else in the Federal code--just about--it gives us more time \nto track down the people who have prepared or are stockpiling this kind \nof material, whether or not they have used it. That is an important \ndistinction.\n  I think this is an important amendment. I cannot believe for a moment \nthat this would kill the bill, that you would have 35 people in the \nHouse vote against this because we made the statute of limitations for \nmaking poison gas the same as for impersonating Smokey the Bear. I find \nthat unfathomable.\n  I thank my colleague for yielding me an extra minute.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, how much time do I have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 6 minutes and 20 seconds.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, let me answer the distinguished Senator.\n  There are people on both sides of the aisle over there who do not \nlike this amendment. We have taken a year to get this done. It was done \n1 month after we passed the Senate bill, which, by the way, was an \nexcellent bill. The fact of the matter is, there are people over there \nwho will kill this bill over any amendment at this particular point. \nEverybody knows that. This is not something new to us.\n  We have had to fight our guts out to get this conference and get the \nconference report done. Frankly, there are a wide variety of viewpoints \non this bill and on some of the aspects of this bill.\n  Look, if somebody is making a bomb, it is very likely you could \ncharge that person under conspiracy, or an attempt statute, or under a \nnumber of other statutes that have longer statutes of limitations. This \nis not--I do not want to call it a phony issue, but it certainly is not \nan issue that should allow a motion to recommit.\n\n  Frankly, 3 years is plenty of time to get somebody who makes a bomb. \nIf they do not get it under this statute, they will get it under \nsomething else. But if you expand it to 5 years, then all of these \npaperwork violations--which primarily is what is prosecuted under this \nstatute, and some of them very unjustly so in the past--all of those \nbecome dragged out for another 2 years.\n  Frankly, we want the law enforcement people, if they feel they have a \nlegitimate reason to prosecute, to prosecute it, and do it quickly so \nthe witnesses are available, so that a lot of other things can be done \nand the people can defend themselves.\n  So there are a number of legitimate reasons why people do not like \nthis amendment and why people in the House would not want this in the \nbill. The purpose of this is to give the bureaucrats a new lease on \nlife without really stopping terrorism. That is what we are talking \nabout here.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, what is the current business?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 3 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. HATCH. I yield back the remaining part of my time. What is the \ncurrent business?\n\n\n                    Vote on Leahy Motion To Recommit\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is now on the motion to table the \nLeahy motion.\n  Mr. HATCH. We do have the motion to table.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The yeas and nays have been ordered.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, on behalf of Senator Dole and myself, I \nalso move to table the Biden-Boxer motion, and ask for the yeas and \nnays as well.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There is a \nsufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. HATCH. It is my understanding that these votes will be back to \nback starting now.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  The question is on agreeing to the motion to lay on the table the \nmotion of the Senator from Vermont. On this question, the yeas and nays \nhave been ordered, and the clerk will call the roll.\n  The clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. LOTT. I announce that the Senator from Florida [Mr. Mack] is \nnecessarily absent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Are there any other Senators in the Chamber \nwho desire to vote?\n  The result was announced--yeas 61, nays 38, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 63 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--61\n\n     Abraham\n     Ashcroft\n     Bennett\n     Bond\n     Breaux\n     Brown\n     Bryan\n     Burns\n     Byrd\n     Campbell\n     Chafee\n     Coats\n     Cochran\n     Cohen\n     Coverdell\n     Craig\n     D'Amato\n     DeWine\n     Dole\n     Domenici\n     Dorgan\n     Exon\n     Faircloth\n     Feinstein\n     Frist\n     Gorton\n     Gramm\n     Grams\n     Grassley\n     Gregg\n     Hatch\n     Hatfield\n     Helms\n     Hollings\n     Hutchison\n     Inhofe\n     Jeffords\n     Johnston\n     Kassebaum\n     Kempthorne\n     Kyl\n     Lott\n     Lugar\n     McCain\n     McConnell\n     Murkowski\n     Nickles\n     Pressler\n     Reid\n     Roth\n     Santorum\n     Shelby\n     Simpson\n     Smith\n     Snowe\n     Specter\n     Stevens\n     Thomas\n     Thompson\n     Thurmond\n     Warner\n\n                                NAYS--38\n\n     Akaka\n     Baucus\n     Biden\n     Bingaman\n     Boxer\n     Bradley\n     Bumpers\n     Conrad\n     Daschle\n     Dodd\n     Feingold\n     Ford\n     Glenn\n     Graham\n     Harkin\n     Heflin\n     Inouye\n     Kennedy\n     Kerrey\n     Kerry\n     Kohl\n     Lautenberg\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Lieberman\n     Mikulski\n     Moseley-Braun\n     Moynihan\n     Murray\n     Nunn\n     Pell\n     Pryor\n     Robb\n     Rockefeller\n     Sarbanes\n     Simon\n     Wellstone\n     Wyden\n\n                             NOT VOTING--1\n\n       \n     Mack\n       \n  So the motion to lay on the table the motion to recommit was agreed \nto.\n  Mr. HATCH.

The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, since these are two stacked votes, I ask \nunanimous consent that there be 1\n\n[[Page S3435]]\n\nminute for debate equally divided in the usual form prior to the vote \non the motion to table the Biden-Boxer motion.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BIDEN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n\n\n                        Biden Motion to Recommit\n\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, let me explain briefly what this is. First, \nright now there is a statute of limitations that if you go out and \nimpersonate Smokey the Bear, you have 5 years to track them down, if \nyou write a bad check you have 5 years. If you make poison gas, if you \nmake a chemical weapon, if you have a rocket propellant charge of more \nthan 4 ounces, if you produce missiles and hide them in your garage, \nand they find them, without them being used, they only have a 3-year \nstatute of limitations. So if they did not find them until 1 year after \nyou have made them, you have 2 years. If they did not find them until \n2\\1/2\\ years, you have 6 months. We want to make this a 5-year statute \nof limitations, just like impersonating Smokey the Bear.\n  This is mindless not to do this when you are talking about making \npoison gas and chemical weapons and grenade launchers.\n  Mr. HATCH addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. This is a National Firearms Act and 3-year limitation. \nThese are mainly paperwork violations. If someone violates beyond \nthat--and for even paperwork they can get them for conspiracy. They can \nprosecute them under a whole variety of statutes that have longer \nstatutes of limitation.\n  This is not a serious issue to us in the Senate, but it is a very \nserious issue to those in the House. We have worked hard to fashion \nthis compromise. It is a doggone good compromise. Our friends in the \nHouse have really worked hard to help us to get it done. Frankly, this \nmotion, as well as others, would kill the bill. So I hope my fellow \nSenators will vote against this motion.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time for debate has expired.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, this is a motion to table, is it not?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. HATCH. I do not have to move to table?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. No.\n  The question is on agreeing to the motion to table the Biden motion \nto recommit the conference report on S. 735 to the committee on \nconference with instructions.

Mr. President, we are now going to move to a motion that I \noffer to recommit the conference report with instructions to add a \nprovision on multipoint wiretaps that was in our original Senate bill.\n  I send it to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       Motion to recommit the conference report on the bill S. 735 \n     to the committee of conference with instructions to the \n     managers on the part of the Senate to disagree to the \n     conference substitute recommended by the committee of \n     conference and insist on inserting the following:\n\n     SEC.  . REVISION TO EXISTING AUTHORITY FOR MULTIPOINT \n                   WIRETAPS.\n\n       (a) Section 2518(ll)(b)(ii) of the title 18 is amended: by \n     deleting ``of a purpose, on the part of that person, to \n     thwart interception by changing facilities.'' and inserting \n     ``that the person had the intent to thwart interception or \n     that the person's actions and conduct would have the effect \n     of thwarting interception from a specified facility.''\n       (b) Section 2518(ll)(b)(iii) is amended to read: ``(iii) \n     the judge finds that such showing has been adequately made.''\n       (c) The amendments made by subsection (a) and (b) of this \n     amendment shall be effective 1 day after the enactment of \n     this Act.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There will be 30 minutes equally divided.\n  Mr. BIDEN. I yield myself 2 minutes.\n  Mr. President, the distinguished Senator, and former Attorney General \nof the State of Connecticut, is here. We are going to divide this up a \nlittle bit. I want to make in my opening statement here a clarification \nfor anyone listening as to what we are doing here, because we are \nreally not changing anything that is not already done in any \nsignificant way.\n  These multipoint wiretaps are made out to be this major new \nconcoction that they have come up with to interfere in the lives of \npeople. I was told in the House conference that some Members of the \nHouse thought that it meant that the FBI would be in vans roving down \nthe street literally eavesdropping on people's homes. It is bizarre \nwhat people think this means.\n  Let me explain what has to happen now to get a multipoint wiretap. \nThere are all sorts of provisions built into the law now for the \nFederal Government: One, the Government must convince a judge that \nthere is probable cause to believe that a specific person is committing \na specific crime, as with any other wiretap. Two, the application even \nto ask a Federal judge for one of these wiretaps is approved at the \nvery top level of the Justice Department, either by the Attorney \nGeneral herself, or the Deputy Attorney General, or the Assistant \nAttorney General for the Criminal Division. No U.S. attorney in America \ncan go out and ask a judge for one of these. No U.S. attorney can do \nthat. No assistant U.S. attorney can do it without the approval of the \nAttorney General, Deputy Attorney General, or the head of the Criminal \nDivision.\n  The application submitted must identify the person involved and \nbelieved to be committing the crime, and whose communications are to be \nthe ones intercepted. A judge then has to find that the target's \naction--that is, the person who they are targeting. Say, we think our \nreporter here is in fact committing a crime. What you have to do is get \nthe judge to believe that there is probable cause to believe a crime \nhas been committed, that he is engaging in an activity. And, further, \nwhen they decide that you can wiretap not only his home phone, but the \nmobile phone he has in his pocket, the phone he has in his car, and the \npay phone he uses all the time--the judge has to believe that the \nperson is committing the crime--and communications are intercepted, it \nhas to be proved that he is trying to effectively thwart the tap. For \nexample, if my phone is tapped and there is probable cause that I \ncommitted a criminal offense, and I walk every day at 2 o'clock down to \nthe pay phone on the corner, or I use a cell phone and then get rid of \nthe new cell phone every day and get a new one, then that effectively \nthwarts the ability of the Federal Government investigators to tap \nsomeone where there is probable cause that they committed a crime. So \nthat\n\n[[Page S3436]]\n\njudge has to believe all that before he grants such an order.\n  In addition, any interception cannot begin until the officers have \nclearly determined that the target in question--that is, the person \nthey believe committed the crime--is using a particular tapped phone. \nOnce the target is off the phone, the interception must end. It does \nnot say, by the way, that any phone that the target uses can be tapped. \nIt says that we have reason to believe that he is using the following \nphone, one, two, or three. You can tap those phones.\n  Once the phone is tapped, if you go to your mother-in-law's house to \nuse the phone, and after you get off, your mother-in-law is off the \nphone, they cannot, under the law, tap your mother-in-law. They must \nend the surveillance. It must stop. It must stop.\n  In addition, the moment the target leaves the phone, the tap on that \nphone has to be disengaged. It cannot be used. Any evidence cannot be \nused that would come from such a tap, if it stayed on. So this is \nnothing new. What is new is that, under the present law, this is used \nfor the mob and other outfits. Under the present law, you have to show \nthat the person is intending to thwart the surveillance--intending to. \nSo essentially what you have to get is a mobster or terrorist saying, \n``I cannot use this phone in my house anymore because I think it is \ntapped. I am going to be going other places to use other phones. I will \nget to you later.'' That is what you basically have to prove now.\n\n  What we are saying in this law is--and 77 Senators voted for it last \nyear--if the effect of the target is to thwart the surveillance, that \nis all you need to prove. The effect is to thwart the surveillance. You \ndo not have to prove that he intended to thwart the surveillance; you \nhave to prove the effect is to thwart surveillance.\n  So, again, a minor change already exists with multipoint wiretaps, is \nalready in place. I will quote Mr. McCollum, the Republican leader of \nthe Criminal Subcommittee. When I offered this in conference, he said:\n\n       I think the reality is quite simple here--\n\n  This is McCollum speaking to me.\n\n       You are 100 percent right.\n\n  I am 100 percent right.\n\n       It is the single-most important issue we are not putting in \n     this bill. We have got to find some way to do it. But we are \n     not going to get the votes for this bill, and we could not \n     get the votes for this freestanding bill, I don't think, \n     right this minute in the House.\n\n  Get the first part: ``It is the single-most important issue we are \nnot putting in the bill.'' Mr. McCollum is right.\n  I yield the remainder of my time to the distinguished Senator from \nConnecticut.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Delaware. Mr. \nMcCollum was right. Senator Biden was right in everything he said, \nexcept for where he said you could not wiretap my mother-in-law. I \nwould like to talk to him later about that.\n  Mr. BIDEN. If the Senator will yield for 3 seconds. His mother-in-law \nmay be listening.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. She probably is.\n  Mr. President, let me say first, both to the Senator from Delaware \nand the Senator from Utah, how very pleased in general I am that we \nhave come as far as we have on this legislation. Over a year ago, \nPresident Clinton challenged us to reach a bipartisan consensus on \ncounterterrorism legislation in the aftermath of the Oklahoma City \ntragedy. The Senate promptly did so, including the Dole-Hatch \nsubstitute bill we passed last spring, including in that bill most of \nthe key provisions of the President's own counterterrorism bill offered \nearlier in the year by Senator Biden and others.\n  Unfortunately, the Senate's spirit of bipartisanship did not reach \nthe other body and did not, as fully as I think it should, reach the \nconference itself. The conference has produced a report and a bill that \nI would term a good bill in the war against terrorism. But it could and \nshould be better. That is why I am supporting Senator Biden's motion to \nrecommit, particularly directing the conference committee to insert \nthis so-called multipoint wiretapping that I was privileged to offer \nalong with Senator Biden and which, as he has indicated, passed the \nSenate overwhelmingly. Not only was that amendment dropped in \nconference, but even what I thought was the entirely uncontroversial \nprovision in the Senate bill that would add specific terrorism offenses \nto the list of crimes for which wiretaps may be authorized was dropped \nas well. In other words, if there is a suspected terrorist out there \nnow and law enforcement wants to tap his or her phones, they have to do \nso on suspicion of a crime being committed but it cannot be a terrorist \nact. They have to find some other specific crime that was committed.\n  Mr. President, these omissions puzzle me and trouble me. I am afraid \nthat they represent some strange left-right marriage of fear or \nskepticism or cynicism about the Government and about law enforcement \nofficials particularly. As Senator Biden has said, the power to \nwiretap--let me say from my own experience and others in law \nenforcement--is a critically important tool in the hands of law \nenforcement, and they need that tool not to feather their own nest or \nbuild their own empires; they need it to protect us from the criminals, \nand in this case the terrorists. They are on our side, those who work \nfor the U.S. attorneys, the FBI, the DEA, and the whole range of other \nlaw enforcement officials down to the State and local police. They are \non our side.\n  There is somehow a feeling that has grown at the extremes of our \npolitical discourse that we have a lot to fear from them. This \nprovision, as Senator Biden has said, incorporates the classically \nAmerican due process rules to make sure that any wiretap that is \nobtained is approved by a judge and is applied and used in narrowly and \nclearly circumscribed ways.\n  Mr. President, for everything I know about terrorism, the ability to \npenetrate the highly secretive world of terrorists is the single most \neffective tool law enforcement officials have to prevent terrorism acts \nfrom happening and then to bring the terrorists to justice. We can \nbuild barriers around Federal buildings. We can increase law \nenforcement presence and try to fortify obvious targets. But we can \nnever defend all of the targets of terrorists, because they are \ncowards. They will look for and strike undefended targets without \nremorse about killing innocent civilians. You simply cannot protect \nevery target. They will strike everywhere. The object of the terrorist \nis to create terror and panic. So, the best defense we have against \nthem is an offense, to penetrate their operations and to know that they \nare about to strike before they strike so we can cut them off. If there \nwas ever a category of crime that warranted the full range of wiretap \ncapacities that law enforcement officials have today, it is terrorism. \nThat is what this amendment would do.\n  Look. In a way, by not including this amendment that the Senate \npassed overwhelmingly, more essentially, allowing the terrorist to use \nall of the tools of modern technology, leave the house phone, go to the \ncell phone, go to the car phone, go to the phone booth, and we are \nsaying to law enforcement, ``Oh, no, you cannot. We are going to make \nit hard for you to follow them. You are going to have to prove that \nthey are moving with an intent to thwart that wiretap.''\n\n  Senator Biden's example is so perfect. Basically we are saying to the \nlaw enforcement folks, you have to hear a terrorist say on the phone \nthat, ``I got to hang up, John. I'm afraid the FBI is listening to me. \nI am going to move out to my cell phone.'' You need that kind of proof \nof intent to get, under the current law, this multipoint wiretap.\n  So we are saying to the bad guys, the criminals, the terrorists, you \ncan use all of this modern telecommunications equipment, but we are \ngoing to stop law enforcement from trailing them. It is as if we said \nduring the cold war that we had intelligence information that the \nSoviet Union had developed some very strong new weapon, that the \nPentagon had the ability to counteract that weapon with a defense, but \nwe are going to put strictures on them from using that weapon. It does \nnot make sense. It is why I think it is so important to adopt this \namendment.\n  Mr. President, multipoint wiretaps are used very sparingly because of \nthe requirements that Senator Biden set out. They have proved, however, \naccording to testimony submitted by Deputy Attorney General Jamie \nGorelick to the Judiciary Committee,\n\n[[Page S3437]]\n\nhighly effective tools in prosecuting today's highly mobile criminals \nand terrorists who may switch phones frequently for any number of \nreasons. Again, as we have asked before on other measures, why allow \nease of obtaining a multipoint wiretap against other criminals, \nincluding organized crime criminals, and not allow it against \nterrorists who threaten us in such a devastating way?\n  Mr. President, the aim of this motion to recommit is a simple one. We \nwant to be sure that our law enforcement officials receive the tools \nthey need, the tools that will be there for them so that swift and \neffective action can be taken to prevent the World Trade Center \nexplosion, to prevent Oklahoma City, to prevent any future disaster of \nthat kind. We owe our Federal law enforcement officials that authority, \nthat capacity, those tools. But the truth is we owe it to ourselves. \nThey are out there trying to protect us and our families from being \ninnocent victims of a terrorist. Every counterterrorism expert that I \nhave ever talked to or ever heard, within the Government and without, \nwill emphasize the importance of infiltration and surveillance in \ncountering terrorists and bringing them to justice. Given the \ndevastating effects of these acts, not only the maiming and death of \nmen, women, and children, but these acts are assaults on the \ninstitutions of our Government, on the democratic processes which we \ncherish, and on our fundamental liberty to move safely and confidently \nthroughout our society. They create the kind of fear that undercuts the \nfreedom that we have fought for.\n  So I do not understand why we would not want to give the law \nenforcement officials the same authority to obtain wiretaps when \npursuing terrorists that they have under current law to pursue other \nkinds of criminals, and why we do not want to improve their ability to \ntrack all criminals, including terrorists, as they move from phone to \nphone and from place to place with the obvious intent of thwarting \nsurveillance and covering their treacherous, deadly deeds.\n  Mr. President, finally, I say we need to give the conferees another \nchance to strengthen this bill. As I said at the outset, it is a good \nbill, but it can and should be a better bill. I fear that, if we do not \ninclude a power like this one, that we are going to come to a day when \nwe are going to look back and regret it--a terrorist act that will \noccur that could have been stopped if law enforcement had this \nauthority.\n  I know we want to pass this bill and have the President sign it by \nthe first anniversary of the Oklahoma City tragedy, but the truth is \nthat I would rather see us do this right, do it as strongly and \neffectively as we can. And if it takes a few more days, so be it. We \nhave waited this long. We can wait a little longer to protect \nourselves, our society, the institutions of our Government, and the \nbasic freedom to live and move around in our great country from the \nhorrible acts of terrorists within our midst.\n  I thank the Chair. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, how much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah has 15 minutes and the \nSenator from Delaware has 1 minute and 54 seconds.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I do not disagree with my two distinguished \ncolleagues on that side that this might be a useful provision. After \nall, I wrote it, and we put it in the Senate bill. I drafted the \nmultipoint language in the Senate bill. However, since that time, some \nhave raised, in their eyes, serious questions as to whether this \nexpanded authority to wiretap American citizens and others is \nnecessary.\n  Because of that, we have worked out this bill through a long series \nof meetings for over a year, culminating Monday night in a conference \nwhere we put everything in this bill we could possibly get into it. We \nbrought it very close to what the original Senate bill was. I think it \nis a darned good bill. We could not get the other side to agree on this \nprovision. It comes down to whether we want a bill or we do not.\n  To this end, because of that, then I insisted we at least put in a \nstudy, a balanced study to look at the excesses of law enforcement with \nregard to wiretapping and the needs of law enforcement with regard to \nwiretapping and the applications of it. The distinguished Senator from \nConnecticut and I both understand how important it is, and so does, of \ncourse, the ranking Democrat on the committee. We will require the \nJustice Department to review its law enforcement surveillance needs and \nreport back to Congress.\n  On that basis, I just want to say that I am committed to working with \nboth Senator Biden and Senator Lieberman to craft legislation which \nwill provide law enforcement with the electronic surveillance \ncapabilities it needs, wiretap authority it needs. I am going to get \nthis done one way or the other in an appropriate way, but the study is \nimportant in the eyes of those on the other side. It is important in my \neyes.\n  I do not want to go into this thing halfcocked, nor do I want to lose \nthis bill because others feel we may be moving into it halfcocked \nwithout having looked at it in a balanced way. So I will work with both \nof my colleagues to craft legislation to provide law enforcement with \nwhatever wiretap authority, expanded wiretap authority it needs beyond \nwhat it has today. I give my colleagues my assurance that we will move \nin this direction with dispatch. I think they both know, when I say \nthat, I mean it. The truth, however, is that this provision would have \ndone nothing--and I repeat nothing--to stop the Oklahoma bombing. This \nis not antiterrorism legislation that would have been necessary to stop \nthe Oklahoma bombing. While multipoint wiretaps may be useful in crime \ninvestigation, we simply do not need to put them in this particular \nlegislation at this time.\n\n  Last evening, Israel was bombed in another bombing attack. I \npersonally do not believe we should wait one more day--knowing that is \ngoing on over there and knowing that we have at least 1,500 known \nterrorists and organizations in this Nation, I do not think we should \nwait one more day, not one more hour in my book, in voting for final \npassage of this bill. We want to assure that terrorist funding is \nprohibited and stopped, and this bill goes a long way toward doing \nthat.\n  Let me mention for the record the letters of support that we have for \nthis bill. They are wide ranging and across the political spectrum: The \nNational Association of Attorneys General, the National Association of \nPolice Officers, the National District Attorneys Association, the Anti-\nDefamation League, Survivors of the Oklahoma Bombing, Citizens for Law \nand Order, the International Association of Chiefs of Police, the \nNational Sheriffs Association, the National Troopers Association, the \nLaw Enforcement Alliance of America, 34 individual State attorneys \ngeneral including the California attorney general, California's \nDistrict Attorneys Association, the National Government Association \nwith regard to the habeas corpus provision, and various Governors, and \nso forth. It is okayed by the Governor of Oklahoma, who is a \nRepublican, Frank Keating, and by the Democrat attorney general, with \nwhom I have had a great deal of joy working, Drew Edmonson. I have a \nlot of respect for him, and he has been willing to work with us to try \nto get this done.\n  Frankly, we do not have a letter, but we do have the verbal support \nof AIPAC, and I might say other attorneys general in this country who \nhave written to us and want to be mentioned. We will put that all in \nthe Record.\n  This is important. This bill is important. I know my colleagues know \nI am sincere when I say I will find some way of resolving these \nmultipoint wiretap problems. Unfortunately, they were called roving \nwiretaps when they came up, and just that rhetorical term has caused us \nsome difficulties and has caused some of the people who feel, after \nWaco, Ruby Ridge, Good Ol' Boys Roundup, et cetera, that even law \nenforcement sometimes is too intrusive into all of our lives, and at \nthis particular time of the year, at tax time, with the feelings about \nthe IRS, there are some who literally feel this is going too far and it \nwill kill this bill if we put it in.\n  So I will move ahead. We will have the study, but I will move ahead \neven while the study is being conducted and do everything I can with my \ntwo colleagues here to get this problem resolved. I intend to do it, \nand we will get it done.\n  I am going to move to table this. I hope folks will vote for the \nmotion to\n\n[[Page S3438]]\n\ntable so that we can continue to preserve this bill and get it done, \nquit playing around with it and get it done. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BIDEN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware has 1 minute 54 \nseconds remaining.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, if the problem is people misunderstand \nbecause this is a roving wiretap, one thing that will get everybody's \nattention is we amend it, send it back, and it will become real clear. \nIn about 20 minutes of discussion, we can have it back here, and it \nwill not kill the bill--if that is the reason.\n  No. 2, in the letter from the chiefs, the president of the \nInternational Association of Chiefs of Police, they do support the bill \nbut they are very clear. Let me quote. They say:\n\n       This legislation does not deal with the ability of law \n     enforcement to use roving wiretaps or 48-hour wiretaps in the \n     case of terrorism even though this later type of wiretap is \n     already authorized in other special situations.\n\n  They list what they do not like about the bill. They do not like the \nfact that this is not in the bill. They strongly support this wiretap \nauthority. And if we cannot get it done now in this bill, I \nrespectfully suggest to my friend that no matter how much he wishes to \nfix this, there will be no ability to get it done standing alone.\n  I yield back whatever seconds I may have remaining.\n  Mr. HATCH addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. The fact is that we have to pass this bill. Frankly, I \nthink we can get this problem solved. It is kind of a world turned \nupside down. When I got here 20 years ago, it was the conservatives who \nwanted expanded wiretap authority and the liberals fought it with \neverything they had. But now all of a sudden we have the liberals \nfighting for wiretap authority and conservatives concerned about it.\n  The fact is it is not just the rhetoric. There is some sincere \nconcern on the part of some Members of the House who are crucial to the \npassage of this bill about putting this in at this time. I believe we \ncan resolve this problem in the future, and I will work hard to do it \nwith my colleagues, but it really cannot be in this bill if we want a \nterrorism bill at this time.\n  I yield back the remainder of my time. On behalf of Senator Dole and \nmyself, I move to table the motion and ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the motion to \ntable the motion to recommit. The yeas and nays have been ordered.

Mr. President, the distinguished ranking member and \nmanager have asked that I yield myself such time as I may require, and \nI add with the proviso, as much time as he wishes. I will obviously \nyield to him.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 15 minutes.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, this is a proposal to strike an \nunprecedented provision--unprecedented until the 104th Congress--to \ntamper with the constitutional protection of habeas corpus.\n  The provision reads:\n\n       (d) An application for writ of habeas corpus on behalf of a \n     person in custody pursuant to the judgment of State court \n     shall not be granted with respect to any claim that was \n     adjudicated on the merits in State court proceedings unless \n     the adjudication of the claim--``(1) resulted in a decision \n     that was contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application \n     of, clearly established Federal law, as determined by the \n     Supreme Court of the United States; or ``(2) resulted in a \n     decision that was based on an unreasonable determination of \n     the facts in light of the evidence presented in the State \n     court proceeding.\n\n  We are about to enact a statute which would hold that constitutional \nprotections do not exist unless they have been unreasonably violated, \nan idea that would have confounded the framers. Thus we introduce a \nvirus that will surely spread throughout our system of laws.\n  Article I, section 9, clause 2 of the Constitution stipulates, ``The \nPrivilege of the Writ of Habeas Corpus shall not be suspended, unless \nwhen in Cases of Rebellion or Invasion the public Safety may require \nit.''\n  We are at this moment mightily and properly concerned about the \npublic safety, which is why we have before the Senate the conference \nreport on the counterterrorism bill. But we have not been invaded, Mr. \nPresident, and the only rebellion at hand appears to be against the \nConstitution itself. We are dealing here, sir, with a fundamental \nprovision of law, one of those essential civil liberties which precede \nand are the basis of political liberties.\n  The writ of habeas corpus is often referred to as the ``Great Writ of \nLiberty.'' William Blackstone called it\n\n[[Page S3439]]\n\n``the most celebrated writ in English law, and the great and \nefficacious writ in all manner of illegal imprisonment.'' It is at the \nvery foundation of the legal system designed to safeguard our \nliberties.\n  I repeat what I have said previously here on the Senate floor: If I \nhad to choose between living in a country with habeas corpus but \nwithout free elections, or a country with free elections but without \nhabeas corpus, I would choose habeas corpus every time. To say again, \nthis is one of the fundamental civil liberties on which every \ndemocratic society of the world has built political liberties that have \ncome subsequently.\n  I make the point that the abuse of habeas corpus--appeals of capital \nsentences--is hugely overstated. A 1995 study by the Department of \nJustice's Bureau of Justice Statistics determined that habeas corpus \nappeals by death row inmates constitute 1 percent of all Federal habeas \nfilings. Total habeas filings make up 4 percent of the caseload of \nFederal district courts. And most Federal habeas petitions are disposed \nof in less than 1 year. The serious delays occur in State courts, which \ntake an average of 5 years to dispose of habeas petitions. If there is \ndelay, the delay is with the State courts.\n  It is troubling that Congress has undertaken to tamper with the Great \nWrit in a bill designed to respond to the tragic circumstances of the \nOklahoma City bombing last year. Habeas corpus has little to do with \nterrorism. The Oklahoma City bombing was a Federal crime and will be \ntried in Federal court.\n  Nothing in our present circumstance requires the suspension of habeas \ncorpus, which is the practical effect of the provision in this bill. To \nrequire a Federal court to defer to a State court's judgment unless the \nState court's decision is unreasonably wrong effectively precludes \nFederal review. I find this disorienting.\n  Anthony Lewis has written of the habeas provision in this bill: ``It \nis a new and remarkable concept in law: that mere wrongness in a \nconstitutional decision is not to be noticed.'' If we agree to this, to \nwhat will we be agreeing next? I restate Mr. Lewis' observation, a \nperson of great experience, a long student of the courts, ``It is a new \nand remarkable concept in law: that mere wrongness in a constitutional \ndecision is not to be noticed.'' Backward reels the mind.\n  On December 8, four United States attorneys general, two Republicans \nand two Democrats, all persons with whom I have the honor to be \nacquainted, Benjamin R. Civiletti, Jr., Edward H. Levi, Nicholas \nKatzenbach, and Elliot Richardson--I served in administrations with Mr. \nLevi, Mr. Katzenbach, and Mr. Richardson; I have the deepest regard for \nthem--wrote President Clinton. I ask unanimous consent that the full \ntext be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                 December 8, 1995.\n     Hon. William J. Clinton,\n     The White House,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. President: The habeas corpus provisions in the \n     Senate terrorism bill, which the House will soon take up, are \n     unconstitutional. Though intended in large part to expedite \n     the death penalty review process, the litigation and \n     constitutional rulings will in fact delay and frustrate the \n     imposition of the death penalty. We strongly urge you to \n     communicate to the Congress your resolve, and your duty under \n     the Constitution, to prevent the enactment of such \n     unconstitutional legislation and the consequent disruption of \n     so critical a part of our criminal punishment system.\n       The constitutional infirmities reside in three provisions \n     of the legislation: one requiring federal courts to defer to \n     erroneous state court rulings on federal constitutional \n     matters, one imposing time limits which could operate to \n     completely bar any federal habeas corpus review at all, and \n     one preventing the federal courts from hearing the evidence \n     necessary to decide a federal constitutional question. They \n     violate the Habeas Corpus Suspension Clause, the judicial \n     powers of Article III, and due process. None of these \n     provisions appeared in the bill that you and Senator Biden \n     worked out in the last Congress together with representatives \n     of prosecutors' organizations.\n       The deference requirement would bar any federal court from \n     granting habeas corpus relief where a state court has \n     misapplied the United States Constitution, unless the \n     constitutional error rose to a level of ``unreasonableness.'' \n     The time-limits provisions set a single period for the filing \n     of both state and federal post-conviction petitions (six \n     months in a capital case and one year in other cases), \n     commencing with the date a state conviction becomes final on \n     direct review. Under these provisions, the entire period \n     could be consumed in the state process, through no fault of \n     the prisoner or counsel, thus creating an absolute bar to the \n     filing of a federal habeas corpus petition. Indeed, the \n     period could be consumed before counsel had even been \n     appointed in the state process, so that the inmate would have \n     no notice of the time limit or the fatal consequences of \n     consuming all of it before filing a state petition.\n       Both of these provisions, by flatly barring federal habeas \n     corpus review under certain circumstances, violate the \n     Constitution's Suspension Clause, which provides: ``The \n     privilege of the Writ of Habeas Corpus shall not be \n     suspended, unless when in the cases of rebellion or invasion \n     the public safety may require it'' (Art. I, Sec. 9, cl. 1). \n     Any doubt as to whether this guarantee applies to persons \n     held in state as well as federal custody was removed by the \n     passage of the Fourteenth Amendment and by the amendment's \n     framers' frequent mention of habeas corpus as one of the \n     privileges and immunities so protected.\n       The preclusion of access to habeas corpus also violates Due \n     Process. A measure is subject to proscription under the due \n     process clause if it ``offends some principle of justice so \n     rooted in the traditions and conscience of our people as to \n     be ranked as fundamental,'' as viewed by ``historical \n     practice.'' Medina v. California, 112 S.Ct. 2572, 2577 \n     (1992). Independent federal court review of the \n     constitutionality of state criminal judgments has existed \n     since the founding of the Nation, first by writ of error, \n     and since 1867 by writ of habeas corpus. Nothing else is \n     more deeply rooted in America's legal traditions and \n     conscience. There is no case in which ``a state court's \n     incorrect legal determination has ever been allowed to \n     stand because it was reasonable,'' Justice O'Connor found \n     in Wright v. West, 112 S.Ct. 2482, 2497; ``We have always \n     held that federal courts, even on habeas, have an \n     independent obligation to say what the law is.'' Indeed, \n     Alexander Hamilton argued, in The Federalist No. 84, that \n     the existence of just two protections--habeas corpus and \n     the prohibition against ex post facto laws--obviated the \n     need to add a Bill of Rights to the Constitution.\n       The deference requirement may also violate the powers \n     granted to the judiciary under Article III. By stripping the \n     federal courts of authority to exercise independent judgment \n     and forcing them to defer to previous judgments made by state \n     courts, this provision runs afoul of the oldest \n     constitutional mission of the federal courts: ``the duty . . \n     . to say what the law is.'' Marbury v. Madison, 5 U.S. (1 \n     Cranch) 137, 177 (1803). Although Congress is free to alter \n     the federal courts' jurisdiction, it cannot order them how to \n     interpret the Constitution, or dictate any outcome on the \n     merits. United States v. Klein, 80 U.S. (13 Wall.) 128 \n     (1871). Earlier this year, the Supreme Court reiterated that \n     Congress has no power to assign ``rubber stamp work'' to an \n     Article III court. ``Congress may be free to establish a . . \n     . scheme that operates without court participation,'' the \n     Court said, ``but that is a matter quite different from \n     instructing a court automatically to enter a judgment \n     pursuant to a decision the court has not authority to \n     evaluate.'' Gutierrez de Martinez v. Lamagno, 115 S.Ct 2227, \n     2234.\n       Finally, in prohibiting evidentiary hearings where the \n     constitutional issue raised does not go to guilt or \n     innocence, the legislation again violates Due Process. A \n     violation of constitutional rights cannot be judged in a \n     vacuum. The determination of the facts assumes'' and \n     importance fully as great as the validity of the substantive \n     rule of law to be applied.'' Wingo v. Wedding, 418 U.S. 461, \n     474 (1974).\n       The last time habeas corpus legislation was debated at \n     length in constitutional terms was in 1968. A bill \n     substantially eliminating federal habeas corpus review for \n     state prisoners was defeated because, as Republican Senator \n     Hugh Scott put it at the end of debate, ``if Congress tampers \n     with the great writ, its action would have about as much \n     chance of being held constitutional as the celebrated \n     celluloid dog chasing the asbestos cat through hell.''\n       In more recent years, the habeas reform debate has been \n     viewed as a mere adjunct of the debate over the death \n     penalty. But when the Senate took up the terrorism bill this \n     year, Senator Moynihan sought to reconnect with the large \n     framework of constitutional liberties: ``If I had to live in \n     a country which had habeas corpus but not free elections,'' \n     he said, ``I would take habeas corpus every time.'' Senator \n     Chafee noted that his uncle, a Harvard law scholar, has \n     called habeas corpus ``the most important human rights \n     provision in the Constitution.'' With the debate back on \n     constitutional grounds, Senator Biden's amendment to \n     delete the deference requirement nearly passed, with 46 \n     votes.\n       We respectfully ask that you insist, first and foremost, on \n     the preservation of independent federal review, i.e., on the \n     rejection of any requirement that federal courts defer to \n     state court judgments on federal constitutional questions. We \n     also urge that separate time limits be set for filing federal \n     and state habeas corpus petitions--a modest change which need \n     not interfere with the setting of strict time limits--and \n     that they begin to run only upon the appointment of competent \n     counsel. And we urge that evidentiary hearings be permitted \n     wherever the factual\n\n[[Page S3440]]\n\n     record is deficient on an important constitutional issue.\n       Congress can either fix the constitutional flaws now, or \n     wait through several years of litigation and confusion before \n     being sent back to the drawing board. Ultimately, it is the \n     public's interest in the prompt and fair disposition of \n     criminal cases which will suffer. The passage of an \n     unconstitutional bill helps no one.\n       We respectfully urge you, as both President and a former \n     professor of constitutional law, to call upon Congress to \n     remedy these flaws before sending the terrorism bill to your \n     desk. We request an opportunity to meet with you personally \n     to discuss this matter so vital to the future of the Republic \n     and the liberties we all hold dear.\n           Sincerely,\n     Benjamin R. Civiletti, Jr.,\n                                                    Baltimore, MD.\n     Edward H. Levi,\n                                                      Chicago, IL.\n     Nicholas deB. Katzenbach,\n                                                    Princeton, NJ.\n     Elliot L. Richardson,\n                                                   Washington, DC.\n\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, let me read excerpts from the letter:\n\n       The habeas corpus provisions in the Senate bill . . . are \n     unconstitutional. Though intended in large part to expedite \n     the death penalty review process, the litigation and \n     constitutional rulings will in fact delay and frustrate the \n     imposition of the death penalty . . .\n       The constitutional infirmities . . . violate the Habeas \n     Corpus Suspension Clause, the judicial powers of Article III \n     and due process . . .\n       . . . A measure is subject to proscription under the due \n     process clause if it ``offends some principle of justice so \n     rooted in the traditions and conscience of our people as to \n     be ranked as fundamental,'' as viewed by ``historical \n     practice.''\n\n  That is Medina versus California, a 1992 decision. To continue,\n\n       Independent federal court review of the constitutionality \n     of state criminal judgments has existed since the founding of \n     the Nation, first by writ of error, and since 1867 by writ of \n     habeas corpus.\n       Nothing else is more deeply rooted in America's legal \n     traditions and conscience. There is no clause in which ``a \n     state court's incorrect legal determination has ever been \n     allowed to stand because it was reasonable.''\n\n  That is Justice O'Connor, in Wright versus West. She goes on, as the \nattorneys general quote,\n\n       We have always held that federal courts, even on habeas, \n     have an independent obligation to say what the law is.\n\n  If I may interpolate, she is repeating the famous injunction of \nJustice Marshall in Marbury versus Madison.\n  The attorneys general go on to say:\n\n       Indeed, Alexander Hamilton argued, in The Federalist No. \n     84, that the existence of just two protections--habeas corpus \n     and the prohibition against ex post facto laws--obviated the \n     need to add a Bill of Rights to the Constitution.\n\n  The letter from the attorneys general continues, but that is the gist \nof it. I might point out that there was, originally, an objection to \nratification of the Constitution, with those objecting arguing that \nthere had to be a Bill of Rights added. Madison wisely added one during \nthe first session of the first Congress. But he and Hamilton and Jay, \nas authors of the Federalist papers, argued that with habeas corpus and \nthe prohibition against ex post facto laws in the Constitution, there \nwould be no need even for a Bill of Rights. We are glad that, in the \nend, we do have one. But their case was surely strong, and it was so \nfelt by the Framers.\n  To cite Justice O'Connor again:\n\n       A state court's incorrect legal determination has never \n     been allowed to stand because it was reasonable.\n\n  Justice O'Connor went on:\n\n       We have always held that Federal courts, even on habeas, \n     have an independent obligation to say what the law is.\n\n  Mr. President, we can fix this now. Or, as the attorneys general \nstate, we can ``wait through several years of litigation and confusion \nbefore being sent back to the drawing board.'' I fear that we will not \nfix it now. The last time this bill was before us, there were only \neight Senators who voted against final passage.\n  We Americans think of ourselves as a new nation. We are not. Of the \ncountries that existed in 1914, there are only eight which have not had \ntheir form of government changed by violence since then. Only the \nUnited Kingdom goes back to 1787 when the delegates who drafted our \nConstitution established this Nation, which continues to exist. In \nthose other nations, sir, a compelling struggle took place, from the \nmiddle of the 18th century until the middle of the 19th century, and \nbeyond into the 20th, and even to the end of the 20th in some \ncountries, to establish those basic civil liberties which are the \nfoundation of political liberties and, of those, none is so precious as \nhabeas corpus, the ``Great Writ.''\n  Here we are trivializing this treasure, putting in jeopardy a \ntradition of protection of individual rights by Federal courts that \ngoes back to our earliest foundation. And the virus will spread. Why \nare we in such a rush to amend our Constitution? Eighty-three \namendments have been offered in this Congress alone. Why do we tamper \nwith provisions as profound to our traditions and liberty as habeas \ncorpus? The Federal courts do not complain. It may be that if we enact \nthis, there will be some prisoners who are executed sooner than they \notherwise would have been. You may take satisfaction in that or not, as \nyou choose, but we will have begun to weaken a tenet of justice at the \nvery base of our liberties. The virus will spread.\n  This is new. It is profoundly disturbing. It is terribly dangerous. \nIf I may have the presumption to join in the judgment of four attorneys \ngeneral, Mr. Civiletti, Mr. Levi, Mr. Katzenbach, and Mr. Richardson--\nand I repeat that I have served in administrations with three of them--\nthis matter is unconstitutional and should be stricken from this \nmeasure.\n  Fourteen years ago, June 6, 1982, to be precise, I gave the \ncommencement address at St. John University Law School in Brooklyn. I \nspoke of the proliferation of court-curbing bills, at that time, but \nwhat I said is, I feel, relevant to today's discussion. I remarked,\n\n       . . . some people--indeed, a great many people--have \n     decided that they do not agree with the Supreme Court and \n     that they are not satisfied to Debate, Legislate, Litigate.\n       They have embarked upon an altogether new and I believe \n     quite dangerous course of action. A new triumvirate hierarchy \n     has emerged. Convene (meaning the calling of a constitutional \n     convention), Overrule (the passage of legislation designed \n     to overrule a particular Court ruling, when the Court's \n     ruling was based on an interpretation of the \n     Constitution), and Restrict (to restrict the jurisdiction \n     of certain courts to decide particular kinds of cases).\n       Perhaps the most pernicious of these is the attempt to \n     restrict courts' jurisdictions, for it is . . . profoundly at \n     odds with our nation's customs and political philosophy.\n       It is a commonplace that our democracy is characterized by \n     majority rule and minority rights. Our Constitution vests \n     majority rule in the Congress and the President while the \n     courts protect the rights of the minority.\n       While the legislature makes the laws, and the executive \n     enforces them, it is the courts that tell us what the laws \n     say and whether they conform to the Constitution.\n       This notion of judicial review has been part of our \n     heritage for nearly two hundred years. There is not a more \n     famous case in American jurisprudence than Marbury v. Madison \n     and few more famous dicta than Chief Justice Marshall's that\n       It is emphatically the province and the duty of the \n     judicial department to say what the law is.\n       But in order for the court to interpret the law, it must \n     decide cases.

Among these provisions \n     is a requirement that federal courts must defer to state \n     courts incorrectly applying federal constitutional law, \n     unless it can be said that the state ruling was \n     ``unreasonable'' incorrect. This is a variation of the \n     proposal by the Reagan and Bush administrations to strip the \n     federal courts of the power to enforce the Constitution when \n     the state court's interpretation of it, though clearly wrong, \n     had been issued after a ``full and fair adjudication.''\n       The Emergency Committee was formed in 1991 to fight this \n     extreme proposal. Our membership consists of both supporters \n     and opponents of the death penalty, Republicans and \n     Democrats, united in the belief that the federal habeas \n     corpus process can be dramatically streamlined without \n     jeopardizing its constitutional core. At a time when \n     proposals to curtail civil liberties in the name of national \n     security are being widely viewed with suspicion, we believe \n     it is vital to ensure that habeas corpus--the means by which \n     all civil liberties are enforced--is not substantially \n     diminished.\n       The habeas corpus reform bill you and Senator Biden \n     proposed in 1993, drafted in close cooperation with the \n     nation's district attorneys and state attorneys general, \n     appropriately recognizes this point. It would codify the \n     long-standing principle of independent federal review of \n     constitutional questions, and specifically reject the ``full \n     and fair'' deference standard.\n       Independent federal review of state court judgments has \n     existed since the founding of the Republic, whether through \n     writ of error or writ of habeas corpus. It has a proud \n     history of guarding against injustices born of racial \n     prejudice and intolerance, of saving the innocent from \n     imprisonment or execution, and in the process, ensuring the \n     rights of all law-abiding citizens. We in the Emergency \n     Committee have fought against proposals to strip the federal \n     courts of power to correct unconstitutional state court \n     actions, alongside other distinguished groups such as the \n     NAACP Legal Defense Fund, the Southern Christian Leadership \n     Conference, the American Bar Association, former prosecutors, \n     and the committee chaired by Justice Powell on which all \n     subsequent reform proposals have been based. We have met with \n     Attorney General Reno, testified in Congress, and \n     successfully argued in the Supreme Court against the adoption \n     of a deference standard, in Wright v. West.\n       We hope you will use the power of your office to ensure \n     that the worthwhile goal of streamlining the review of \n     criminal cases is accomplished without diminishing \n     constitutional liberties.

Daniel Patrick Moynihan,\n     Senate Russell Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Moynihan: We understand that the Senate may \n     act next week on the habeas corpus provisions in Senator \n     Dole's terrorism legislation. Among these provisions is a \n     requirement that federal courts must defer to state courts \n     incorrectly applying federal constitutional law, unless it \n     can be said that the state ruling was ``unreasonably'' \n     incorrect. This is a variation of past proposals to strip the \n     federal courts of the power to enforce the Constitution when \n     the state court's interpretation of it, though clearly wrong, \n     had been issued after a ``full and fair'' hearing.\n       The Emergency Committee was formed in 1991 to fight this \n     extreme proposal. Our membership consists of both supporters \n     and opponents of the death penalty, Republicans and \n     Democrats, united in the belief that the federal hebeas \n     corpus process can be dramatically streamlined without \n     jeopardizing its constitutional core. At a time when \n     proposals to curtail civil liberties in the name of national \n     security are being widely viewed with suspicion, we believe \n     it is vital to ensure that habeas corpus--the means by which \n     all civil liberties are enforced--is not substantively \n     diminished.\n       The hebeas corpus reform bill President Clinton proposed in \n     1993, drafted in close cooperation with the nation's district \n     attorneys and state attorneys general, appropriately \n     recognizes this point. It would codify the long-standing \n     principle of independent federal review of constitutional \n     questions, and specifically reject the ``full and fair'' \n     deference standard.\n       Independent federal review of state court judgments has \n     existed since the founding of the Republic, whether through \n     writ of error or writ of hebeas corpus.

Independent federal \n     review was endorsed by the committee chaired by Justice \n     Powell on which all subsequent reform proposals have been \n     based, and the Supreme Court itself specifically considered \n     but declined to require deference to the states, in Wright v. \n     West in 1992.\n       We must emphasize that this issue of deference to state \n     rulings has absolutely no bearing on the swift processing of \n     terrorism offenses in the federal system. For federal \n     inmates, the pending habeas reform legislation proposes \n     dramatic procedural reforms but appropriately avoids any \n     curtailment of the federal courts' power to decide federal \n     constitutional issues. This same framework of reform will \n     produce equally dramatic results in state cases. Cutting back \n     the enforcement of constitutional liberties for people \n     unlawfully held in state custody is neither necessary to \n     habeas reform nor relevant to terrorism.\n       We are confident that the worthwhile goal of streamlining \n     the review of criminal cases can be accomplished without \n     diminishing constitutional liberties.

Combating terrorism is vitally important, but it \n     should not threaten long-established rights of privacy, free \n     speech and due process.\n       Last June the Senate rashly passed the Comprehensive \n     Terrorism Protection Act of 1995. The bill contained some \n     reasonable measures, including an increase in F.B.I. staff \n     and revisions in Federal law that would make it easier to \n     trace bombs and impose harsher penalties for dealing in \n     explosives.\n       But the legislation also authorized intrusive new \n     surveillance powers for law enforcement agencies, crackdown \n     on suspect aliens\n\n[[Page S3442]]\n\n     and an ill-advised blurring of the line between military and \n     police forces. To assure passage, Mr. Clinton unwisely agreed \n     to withdraw his objections to incorporating a change in \n     habeas corpus standards that would limit death row appeals in \n     Federal courts.\n       A corresponding bill under consideration in the House this \n     week does not include some of the most troubling Senate \n     provisions, including the expanded role for military forces \n     in domestic law enforcement. But House members who take their \n     constitutional vows seriously should eliminate or modify \n     other damaging provisions in the bill.\n       Among other dubious steps, the House bill would grant the \n     Secretary of State expansive authority to brand foreign \n     groups and their domestic affiliates as terrorists, thereby \n     making it a crime for Americans to support the group's \n     activities, even if they are perfectly legal. Members of \n     designated terrorist groups would be barred from entering the \n     country to speak, reviving a discredited practice that was \n     discarded in 1990 with repeal of the McCarthy-era McCarran-\n     Walter Act.\n       Under the House legislation, the Attorney General would be \n     given unchecked authority to elevate ordinary state and \n     Federal crimes to acts of terrorism, carrying sentences \n     ranging up to death. The F.B.I., which already has ample \n     authority to pursue terrorists, would get new powers to \n     obtain phone and travel records without having to establish \n     that a suspect seemed to be engaging in criminal activity. \n     Government wiretap authority would be expanded, with reduced \n     judicial oversight.\n       The proposed change in habeas corpus would undermine the \n     historic role of the Federal courts in correcting \n     unconstitutional state court convictions and sentences. If \n     Congress is determined to make this alteration, it should at \n     least address the question separately and carefully, rather \n     than tagging it onto an antiterrorism bill.\n       These objectionable measures are not included in a \n     promising alternative bill proposed by three Democratic \n     representatives--John Conyers Jr. of Michigan, Jerrold Nadler \n     of New York and Howard Berman of California.\n       Americans were shaken and angered by the explosion that \n     shattered the Federal building in Oklahoma City and killed \n     169 people. Congress is right to give Federal law enforcement \n     agencies more money and manpower. Diminishing American \n     liberties is not the solution to terrorism.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n                [From the New York Times, Apr. 8, 1996]\n\n                    Grave Trouble for the Great Writ\n\n       Members of Congress are exploiting public concerns about \n     terrorism to threaten basic civil liberties. Of these, not \n     one is more precious than the writ of habeas corpus--the \n     venerable Great Writ devised by English judges to guard \n     against arbitrary imprisonment and, in modern terms, a vital \n     shield against unfair trials.\n       Both the House and Senate have voted to weaken the modern \n     version of habeas corpus beyond recognition. Invading the \n     province of the independent Federal judiciary, their \n     proposals would forbid judges from rendering their own \n     findings of fact and law, virtually instructing the judges to \n     decide cases against the petitioning prisoner. President \n     Clinton, who has waffled on the issue, needs to warn Congress \n     that he will not sign this unconstitutional measure just to \n     get a terrorism law.\n       The writ has long been available in America to tell \n     sheriffs and wardens to ``produce the body'' of the prisoner \n     and justify the jailing in court. Congress applied the habeas \n     corpus power in 1867 to give Federal district courts the \n     power to review state criminal convictions. Since then, \n     judges have set aside many sentences of prisoners who failed \n     to receive fair trials, including some condemned to die \n     because prosecutors concealed evidence of their innocence.\n       The antiterrorism bills contain provisions that would \n     accelerate the executions of condemned prisoners, at great \n     risk to their fundamental rights. These provisions have \n     survived Congressional debate even though other provisions \n     that might actually have done something about terrorism--\n     banning bullets that pierce police vests and tagging \n     explosives to enable law enforcement to trace terrorist \n     bombs--were scrapped on the House floor.\n       The most pernicious legal change would instruct Federal \n     judges that they are bound by state court findings when \n     determining the fairness of a prisoner's criminal trial. Only \n     when those findings are ``unreasonable'' or flatly contradict \n     clearly announced Supreme Court rulings can the Federal court \n     overturn them. State courts rarely disobey the high court \n     openly. But they still make serious mistakes. Federal judges \n     have often found state court judgments woefully sloppy though \n     masked in neutral language the new proposals would insulate \n     from review.\n       A Supreme Court case from last year makes the point. By a \n     distressingly thin 5-to-4 margin, the Court set aside the \n     death sentence of a man whose murder conviction rested on the \n     word of an informant whose potential motives for falsely \n     accusing him were known to the police but concealed from the \n     defense. The condemned man's conviction survived many layers \n     of state and Federal judicial review before reaching the \n     Supreme Court. Under the proposal in Congress, the defendant, \n     instead of getting a new trial, would get the chair.\n       By essentially telling independent Federal judges how to \n     decide cases, the bill unconstitutionally infringes on the \n     jurisdiction of a coordinate branch of government and \n     potentially violates the Constitution's stricture that the \n     writ of habeas corpus shall not be suspended except in time \n     of war or dire emergency. It also includes unrealistic \n     deadlines for filing court petitions and undue restraints on \n     legal resources available to prisoners. Unless a Senate-House \n     conference committee can disentangle habeas corpus from \n     terrorism, Mr. Clinton has a duty to warn that he will veto \n     the entire package.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n                [From the New York Times, July 7, 1995]\n\n                         Mr. Clinton's Betrayal\n\n                           (By Anthony Lewis)\n\n       Boston.--For Bill Clinton's natural supporters, the most \n     painful realization of his Presidency is that he is a man \n     without a bottom line. He may abandon any seeming belief, any \n     principle. You cannot rely on him.\n       There is a telling example to hand. As the Senate debated a \n     counterterrorism bill last month, Mr. Clinton changed his \n     position on the power of Federal courts to issue writs of \n     habeas corpus. The Senate then approved a provision that may \n     effectively eliminate that power.\n       The issue may sound legalistic, but habeas corpus has been \n     the great historic remedy for injustice. By the Great Writ, \n     as it is called, Federal courts have set aside the \n     convictions of state prisoners because they were tortured \n     into confessing or convicted by other unconstitutional means.\n       In recent years conservatives in Congress have attacked the \n     habeas corpus process because it delays the execution of \n     state prisoners on death row. Some prisoners do file \n     frivolous petitions. But in other cases conservative Federal \n     judges have found grave violations of constitutional rights--\n     ones not found in state courts, often because the defendants \n     had such incompetent lawyers.\n       After the Oklahoma City bombing, Senate Republicans decided \n     to attach a crippling habeas provision to the \n     counterterrorism bill. On May 23 four former Attorneys \n     General, Democrats and Republicans--Benjamin Civiletti, \n     Nicholas deB. Katzenbach, Edward H. Levi and Elliot L. \n     Richardson--wrote President Clinton urging him to oppose it.\n       ``It is vital,'' they wrote, ``to insure that habeas \n     corpus--the means by which all civil liberties are enforced--\n     is not substantively diminished.\n       . . . It has a proud history of guarding against injustices \n     born of racial prejudice and intolerance, of saving the \n     innocent from imprisonment or execution and in the process \n     insuring the rights of all law-abiding citizens.''\n       Two days later President Clinton wrote the Senate majority \n     leader, Bob Dole, to say that he favored habeas corpus reform \n     so long as it preserved ``the historic right to meaningful \n     Federal review.'' The issue should be addressed later, he \n     said, not in the counterterrorism bill.\n       Then, on June 5, Mr. Clinton appeared on television on \n     CNN's ``Larry King Live.'' Asked about habeas corpus, he said \n     reform ``ought to be done in the context of this terrorism \n     legislation.''\n       It was a complete switch from his position of less than two \n     weeks before. And it had the effect of undermining Senate \n     supporters of habeas corpus.\n       Two days later the Senate approved the Republican measure. \n     The House has also passed stringent restrictions on habeas \n     corpus, so almost certainly there will be legislation putting \n     a drastic crimp on the historic writ.\n       The Senate bill says that no Federal court may grant habeas \n     corpus to a state prisoner if state courts had decided his or \n     her claim on the merits--unless the state decision was \n     ``contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of'' \n     Federal constitutional law as determined by the Supreme \n     Court.\n       That language seems to mean that Federal judges must \n     overlook even incorrect state rulings on constitutional \n     claims, so long as they are not ``unreasonably'' incorrect. \n     It is a new and remarkable concept in law; that mere \n     wrongness in a constitutional decision is not to be noticed.\n       Experts in the field say the provision may effectively \n     eliminate Federal habeas corpus. It signals Federal judges to \n     stay their hands. And what Federal judge will want to say \n     that his state colleagues have been not just wrong but \n     ``unreasonable''?\n       The President explained to Larry King that attaching the \n     habeas corpus provision to the counterterrorism bill would \n     speed proceedings in the prosecutions brought over the \n     Oklahoma bombing. But those are Federal prosecutions, not \n     covered by this bill.\n       No, the reason for President Clinton's turnabout is clear \n     enough. He thinks there is political mileage in looking tough \n     on crime. Compared with that, the Great Writ is unimportant.\n       In 1953 Justice Hugo L. Black wrote: ``It is never too late \n     for courts in habeas corpus proceedings . . . to prevent \n     forfeiture of life or liberty in flagrant defiance of the \n     Constitution.'' Now, thanks to Bill Clinton and the \n     Republicans in Congress, it may be.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n                [From the New York Times, Dec. 8, 1995]\n\n                         Is It a Zeal To Kill?\n\n                           (By Anthony Lewis)\n\n       An Illinois man who had been on death row for 11 years, \n     Orlando Cruz, had a new trial last month and was acquitted of \n     murder. The\n\n[[Page S3443]]\n\n     record, including police perjury, was so rank that the \n     Justice Department has begun investigating possible civil \n     rights violations.\n       In the last 20 years, 54 Americans under sentence of death \n     have been released from prison because of evidence of their \n     innocence. In an important pending case, a U.S. Court of \n     Appeals has scheduled a hearing for Paris Carriger, an \n     Arizona death row inmate who some usually skeptical \n     criminologists believe is probably innocent.\n       Congress is now preparing to deal with the fact that \n     innocent men and women are occasionally sentenced to death in \n     this country. Congress's answer is: Execute them anyway, \n     guilty or innocent.\n       That result will follow, inevitably, from legislation that \n     is heading for the floor of the House and has already passed \n     the Senate. It would limit Federal habeas corpus, the legal \n     procedure by which state prisoners can go to Federal courts \n     to argue that they were unconstitutionally convicted or \n     sentenced.\n       Federal habeas corpus has played a crucial part in saving \n     wrongly convicted men and women from execution. One reason is \n     that state judges, most of them elected, want to look \n     strongly in favor of capital punishment. For example, Alabama \n     judges have rejected 47 jury recommendations for life \n     sentences, imposing death instead, while reducing jury death \n     sentences to life only 5 times.\n       The habeas corpus restrictions moving through Congress \n     would increase the chance of an innocent person being \n     executed in two main ways.\n       The first deals with the right to bring in newly discovered \n     evidence of innocence in a fresh habeas corpus petition. \n     There are legal rules against successive petitions, but there \n     is an escape hatch for genuine evidence of innocence.\n       Today a prisoner is entitled to a habeas corpus hearing, \n     despite the rules against repeated petitions, if his new \n     evidence makes it ``more likely than not that no reasonable \n     juror would have convicted him.'' The pending legislation \n     would change the ``more likely'' standard to the far more \n     demanding one of ``clear and convincing evidence.''\n       Second, the legislation as passed by the Senate raises a \n     new obstacle. Federal courts would be forbidden to grant \n     habeas corpus if a claim had been decided by state courts--\n     unless the state decision was ``an arbitrary or \n     unreasonable'' interpretation of established Federal \n     constitutional law.\n       Apparently, a Federal judge could not free a probably \n     innocent state prisoner if he had been convicted as the \n     result of a state court constitutional ruling that was merely \n     wrong. It would have to be ``unreasonably'' wrong--a \n     remarkable new concept.\n       Why would members of Congress want to increase the chances \n     of innocent men and women being gassed or electrocuted or \n     given lethal injections? Perhaps I am naive, but I find that \n     difficult to understand.\n       The country's agitated mood about crime, fed by demagogic \n     politicians, makes Congress--and Presidents--want to look \n     tough on crime. One result is zeal for the death penalty.\n       But that cannot explain a zeal to cut off newly discovered \n     evidence of a prisoner's likely innocence and execute him, \n     guilty or innocent. Can our political leaders really be so \n     cynical that they put the tactical advantage of looking tough \n     on crime ahead of an innocent human life?\n       It is a question for, among others, Senator Orrin Hatch and \n     Representative Henry Hyde, chairmen of the Senate and House \n     Judiciary Committees. Whatever their political outlook, I \n     have never thought them indifferent to claims of humanity.\n       President Clinton must also face the reality of what this \n     legislation would do. Last May he wrote Senator Bob Dole that \n     he favored habeas corpus reform so long as it preserved ``the \n     historic right to meaningful Federal review.'' He opposed \n     adding a habeas corpus provision to counterterrorism \n     legislation--but a few days later he abandoned that position.\n       In the House the clampdown on habeas corpus is going to be \n     part of a counterterrorism bill coming out of the Judiciary \n     Committee. The bill has many other problems, of fairness and \n     free speech. But the attack on habeas corpus is a question of \n     life and death.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n                [From the New York Times, Apr. 15, 1996]\n\n                          Stand Up for Liberty\n\n                           (By Anthony Lewis)\n\n       Washington.--In one significant respect, Bill Clinton's \n     Presidency has been a surprising disappointment and a \n     grievous one. That is in his record on civil liberties.\n       This week Congress is likely to finish work on legislation \n     gutting Federal habeas corpus, the historic power of Federal \n     courts to look into the constitutionality of state criminal \n     proceedings. Innocent men and women, convicted of murder in \n     flawed trials, will be executed if that protection is gone.\n       And President Clinton made it possible. With a nod and a \n     wink, he allowed the habeas corpus measure to be attached to \n     a counterterrorism bill that he wanted--a bill that has \n     nothing to do with state prosecutions.\n       House and Senate conferees are likely to finish work on the \n     terrorism bill this week, and both houses to act on it. Last \n     week Attorney General Janet Reno sent a long letter to the \n     conferees. Reading it, one is struck by how insensitive the \n     Clinton Administration is to one after another long-\n     established principle of civil liberties.\n       The letter demands, for example, that the Government be \n     given power to deport aliens as suspected terrorists without \n     letting them see the evidence against them--arguing for even \n     harsher secrecy provisions than ones the House struck from \n     the bill last month. It says there is no constitutional \n     right to see the evidence in deportation proceedings, \n     though the Supreme Court has held that there is.\n       Ms. Reno denounces the House for rejecting a Clinton \n     proposal that the Attorney General be allowed to convert an \n     ordinary crime into ``terrorism'' by certifying that it \n     transcended national boundaries and was intended to coerce a \n     government. Instead, in the House bill, the Government would \n     have to prove those charges to a judge and jury--a burden the \n     Clinton Administration does not want to bear.\n       The Reno letter objects to ``terrorists'' being given \n     rights. But that assumes guilt. The whole idea of our \n     constitutional system is that people should have a fair \n     chance to answer charges before they are convicted. Does \n     Janet Reno think we should ignore the Fourth and Fifth and \n     Sixth Amendments because they protect ``criminals''? Does \n     Bill Clinton?\n       Even before the terrorism bill, with its habeas corpus and \n     numerous other repressive provisions, the Administration had \n     shown a cavalier disregard for civil liberties. The Clinton \n     record is bleak, for example, in the area of privacy.\n       President Clinton supported the F.B.I.'s demands for \n     legislation requiring that new digital telephone technology \n     be shaped to assure easy access for government eavesdroppers. \n     That legislation passed, and then the Administration asked \n     for broader wiretap authority in the counterterrorism bill. \n     (That is one proposal Congress seems unwilling to \n     swallow.)\n       The President also supported intrusive F.B.I. demands for \n     ways to penetrate methods used by businesses and individuals \n     to assure the privacy of their communications. He called for \n     all encryption methods to have a decoder key to which law-\n     enforcement officials would have access.\n       Recently Mr. Clinton issued an executive order authorizing \n     physical searches without a court order to get suspected \n     foreign intelligence information. That is an extraordinary \n     assertion of power, without legislation, to override the \n     Constitution's protection of individuals' privacy.\n       He has also called for a national identity card, which \n     people would have to provide on seeking a job to prove they \n     are not illegal aliens. That idea is opposed by many \n     conservatives and liberals as a step toward an authoritarian \n     state.\n       Beyond the particular issues, Mr. Clinton has failed as an \n     educator. He has utterly failed to articulate the reasons why \n     Americans should care about civil liberties: the reasons of \n     history and of our deepest values. This country was born, \n     after all, in a struggle for those liberties.\n       His record is so disappointing because he knows better. Why \n     has he been so insensitive to the claims of liberty?\n       The answer is politics: politics of a narrow and dubious \n     kind. The President wants to look tough on terrorism and \n     aliens and crime. So he demands action where there is no need \n     or public demand. Without his push, the excesses of the \n     terrorism bill would have no meaningful constituency.\n       He would do better for himself, as for the country, if he \n     stood up for our liberties. And there is history. Does Bill \n     Clinton really want to be remembered as the President who \n     sold out habeas corpus?\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n            Excerpt From Statement of Administration Policy\n\n       Finally, H.R. 2703 contains provisions to reform Federal \n     habeas corpus procedures. The Administration has consistently \n     and strongly supported habeas corpus reform in order to \n     assure that criminal offenders receive swift and certain \n     punishment. Indeed, the Administration believes that the bill \n     could be improved to provide additional guarantees that \n     offenders have only ``one bite at the apple'' and complete \n     the process even more expeditiously. These further \n     limitations should be accompanied by necessary changes in the \n     scope of review afforded to such petitions. H.R. 2703 would \n     establish a standard of review for Federal courts on \n     constitutional issues that is excessively narrow and subject \n     to potentially meritorious constitutional challenges. To \n     achieve the twin goals of finality and fairness. H.R. 2703 \n     should shorten the duration and reduce the number of reviews \n     for each criminal conviction while preserving the full scope \n     of habeas review so that it can continue to serve its \n     historic function as the last protection against wrongful \n     conviction. The Administration hopes to work with the House \n     and the conferees to achieve these ends.\n\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, is leader time reserved?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Yes.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/04/17/senate-section/article/S3427-4", "month": "04", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "17", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3443-S3445]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           BROADCAST BLACKOUT\n\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, TV broadcasters have broken their trust with \nthe American people. For more than 40 years, the American people have \ngenerously lent TV station owners our Nation's airwaves for free. Now \nsome broadcasters want more and will stop at nothing to get it. They \nare bullying Congress and running a multimillion-\n\n[[Page S3444]]\n\ndollar scare campaign to mislead the public.\n  The reason is simple: Why pay for something when you can get it for \nfree? But there is one small problem. The airwaves are the Nation's \nmost valuable natural resource and are worth billions and billions of \ndollars. They do not belong to the broadcasters. They do not belong to \nthe phone companies. They do not belong to the newspapers. Each and \nevery wave belongs to the American people, the American taxpayers. Our \nairwaves are just as much a national resource as our national parks.\n  Enter the TV broadcasters. Earlier this year, I blocked their \nlegislative efforts to get spectrum for free. At my request, Congress \nis now holding open hearings on reforming our spectrum policies.\n  Apparently, the democratic process is not good enough for most \nbroadcasters. So TV broadcasters are now running ads and so-called \npublic service announcements, claiming that TV will die without this \nhuge corporate welfare program, this billions and billions of dollars \nthey want to take away from the American taxpayers. Of course, they do \nnot call this giveaway welfare; they call it a tax. Imagine calling a \ngiveaway a tax.\n  Also, I am aware that some broadcasters have asked Members of \nCongress to drop by their stations. In the midst of these friendly \ndiscussions, the broadcasters say, ``I thought you might want to see \nthe ad we are considering running in your district.''\n  So much for subtlety.\n  It seems to me the broadcasters should be happy with the deal they \nalready have. They have been getting free channels for years. In \nreturn, they fulfill public interest obligations, such as reporting \nnews and information. Now they want more airwaves for free.\n  Newspapers also report the news, but Congress has never had to buy \nthem off. It seems to me that giving broadcasters free spectrum is like \ngiving newspapers free paper from our national forests.\n  Congress has never challenged whether broadcasters should be allowed \nto keep a channel. Instead, we are simply stating that if broadcasters \nwant more channels, then they are going to pay the taxpayers for them. \nThat does not kill television.\n  The broadcasters say they cannot afford to buy additional airwaves, \nwhich the Congressional Budget Office estimates is worth at least $12 \nbillion. Last time I checked, the American people cannot afford to give \nit to them free.\n  We are trying to balance a budget with tax cuts for families with \nchildren, reducing spending, and closing loopholes.\n  Broadcasters say that if they had to pay for the extra airwaves, it \nwould be the end of so-called free, over-the-air television. The facts \nspeak otherwise. According to the Washington Post, over the last 2 \nyears broadcast deals in the private sector amounted to a whooping \n$31.3 billion. That is with a ``b''--billion dollars.\n  Here is another fact. All TV broadcast licenses in America were \noriginally given away for free, but only 6 percent are still in the \nhands of the original licensee. The other 94 percent have been bought \nand sold. My point is that broadcasters have a long history of paying \ntop dollar for existing channels. Somehow they cannot afford any new \nones unless the taxpayer picks up the tab.\n\n\n                     unfunded mandate on consumers\n\n  Before Congress lets huge moneyed interests get their fingers on this \nnational resource, we must be certain that the American taxpayer is \nfully protected. The policy broadcasters' want will not only force \ntaxpayers to giveaway valuable airwaves, it will also force consumers \nto spend hundreds of billions of their own dollars on new equipment \nwhich is a point that I think has been overlooked. They have been \ntrying to frighten everybody with television, and to get their way are \ngoing to have to have another television or some attachment.\n  The fact is that federally mandating a transition to digital \nbroadcast will ultimately render all television sets in the country \nobsolete. You will not be able to use your television set.\n  Consumers will be forced to buy either new television sets or \nconvertor boxes to receive so-called free, over-the-air broadcasts.\n  Last year we passed the unfunded mandates law. Perhaps some have \nforgotten, but that law applies to more than just State and local \ngovernments. It applies to the private sector and most importantly to \nindividuals.\n  The impact of the broadcasters' plan would be dramatic. There are 222 \nmillion television sets in this country. At a Senate Budget Committee \nhearing last month, the broadcasters testified that the average digital \ntelevision set's estimated cost is $1,500, while the less expensive \nconverter box will cost approximately $500. Replacing every television \nset in America with a digital one would cost $333 billion. Using the \nless expensive converter box would cost $111 billion. No doubt about \nit, consumers will not be happy that Congress made this choice for \nthem. That is precisely what we are going to do here unless we wake up \nand smell something.\n  The American people should have a say before Congress makes a \ndecision on spectrum. After all, the airwaves are theirs and so are \ntheir TV sets. Neither belongs to the broadcasters.\n\n\n                            NETWORK COVERAGE\n\n  Finally, TV broadcasters have rightly kept a watchful eye on a \nbloated Government. Whether it was $600 toilet seats or $7,000 coffee \npots, they have always helped us quickly identify waste. But they have \nbeen strangely silent on this issue. In contrast, story after story, \nand editorial after editorial, protested this giveaway in the print \nmedia.\n  In fact, I have a whole bookful here. In fact, this is loaded with \neditorials and comments about this giveaway. You do not see it on \ntelevision.\n  There have been a few exceptions. I want to be fair. CNN, which is a \ncable network, has reported on this issue, while CBS made an attempt a \nmonth ago. So-called public interest obligations seem to have gone out \nthe window when it is not in the broadcasters' self-interest.\n  If five Senators took a legitimate trip somewhere overseas to \ninvestigate something that might be costing the American people money, \nthat is reported on the evening news as a junket costing thousands and \nthousands of dollars to the American taxpayer because the Senators were \nover there trying to see if they were spending too much on foreign aid \nmaybe in Bosnia or maybe somewhere else. That would be news. Maybe it \nis news. Maybe it should be reported. But when it comes to billion \ndollar giveaways, to them ``mum'' is the word. You never hear about it \non television. Dan Rather will not utter a word. Peter Jennings, Tom \nBrokow--maybe they do not know about it. But I would say to the \nAmerican taxpayers and the people with TV sets that somebody had better \nprotect the American public.\n  I have even had a threatening letter, which I will not put in the \nfile, that if I do not shape up and stop talking about this, this \nbroadcaster is going to get his 700 employees to vote for someone else \nin November. That is intimidation.\n  I have no quarrel with the broadcasters. I have always thought they \nwere my friends. But it seems to me that when we are trying to balance \nthe budget and when we are asking everybody to make a sacrifice, then \nwe ought to make certain that we do not give something away worth \nbillions and billions and billions of dollars.\n  Maybe the broadcasters felt this issue was not newsworthy. But if \nthat is the case, why did the National Association of Broadcasters vote \nto go on the offensive and launch a multi-million-dollar ad campaign to \npreserve, as they spin it, free, over-the-air broadcasting?\n  I have already indicated it is not going to be free. It is going to \ncost you $500 for a converter box or $1,500 for a new TV set. That is \nnot free.\n  I did not realize that ad campaigns have replaced the evening news.\n\n\n                               conclusion\n\n  Mr. President, if the broadcasters have a case to make, Congress is \nprepared to hear them. We are having fair and open hearings. That is \nwhat democracy is all about. It is not about distorting the truth and \nmaking thinly veiled threats. The American people know this. And \ndespite what some might think, we are not easily duped.\n  I hope that fairness will prevail. I do not know what the value \nshould be. But we should find out. Maybe it is $1. Maybe it is $1 \nmillion. Maybe it is $50\n\n[[Page S3445]]\n\nbillion. But I never found anything wrong with having a hearing and \nasking the people that might be impacted, including the American \nconsumer, to come to testify. I believe many broadcasters understand \ntheir responsibility. Maybe there are only a few out there leading this \neffort to mislead the American public and to walk away with billions of \ndollars in welfare from the Congress of the United States.\n  I know this is not a very popular thing to do--to get up and take on \nTV broadcasters or radio broadcasters because they have a lot of free \naccess to the airwaves. But I believe, if we are serious about the \nbudget and serious about the future, serious about the taxpayers, that \nit at least ought to be raised.\n  So I think they are all legitimate. But I think those broadcasters \nwho have not been blinded by greed--and there are a lot of them out \nthere that have not--will help shape the future of television.\n  Again, I must say that I know it does not get a lot of attention. But \nthere are all kinds of columns here by different people, William Safire \nand others, page after page, hundreds of pages of stories about this \ngiveaway.\n  I know the broadcasters are meeting in Las Vegas, and I think it is \ntime to throw the dice and have a hearing. Maybe they can make their \ncase. That is what Congress is all about.\n  But it seems to me that the President, I think, should have an \ninterest in this. It is not a partisan issue. It is an issue of how we \nare going to pay the bills, how we are going to balance the budget, and \nwhat amount will properly be received in charging for spectrum.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, will the majority leader yield for a \nquestion?\n  Mr. DOLE. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Does the leader have in mind to schedule hearings and \nto ask the administration officials to testify?\n  Mr. DOLE. In fact, I think we have had one. Senator Pressler, \nchairman of the Commerce Committee, had 1 day of hearings. There will \nbe another day of hearings, I think, next week to be followed by \nadditional hearings. So there is an effort to have everybody come in \nand testify and then make a judgment.\n  I see the Senator from South Dakota is on the floor now. That was \npart of the agreement on the telecommunications bill--that the bill \nwould go forward, there would be hearings, and Congress would make a \njudgment for the American people. We are going to have to cough up the \nmoney on what we should do.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. I thank the Senator. It is none too soon.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/04/17/senate-section/article/S3443-1", "month": "04", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "17", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3445]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        IRANIAN ARMS FOR BOSNIA\n\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, since the report surfaced in the Los Angeles \nTimes that President Clinton decided to allow Iran to provide arms to \nthe Bosnians, there has been little, if any, response from the other \nside of the aisle.\n  Had there been a Republican in the White House, no doubt, the \nDemocrats would have been all over the President. But, that is not the \nreal issue. I am not here to be all over the President. This is not \nabout the conduct of partisan politics, but the conduct of our foreign \npolicy. This is about American leadership, American credibility, and \nCongressional oversight. That is why I met today with the chairmen of \nthe Foreign Relations, Intelligence, Armed Services, and Judiciary \nCommittees to discuss this serious foreign policy matter. For nearly 3 \nyears, this administration opposed congressional efforts to lift the \nunjust and illegal arms embargo on Bosnia and Herzegovina. We were \ntold, and the American people were told, that the United States was \nbound by the U.N. embargo on the former Yugoslavia. We were told that \nif America violated this embargo, we would lose support from our allies \nfor other embargoes, such as the one against Iraq. Finally, we were \ntold that lifting the embargo and allowing the Bosnians to have arms \nwhile U.N. forces were deployed in Bosnia, would endanger the troops of \nour allies.\n  Some people are saying, well, you knew that Iran was providing arms \nto the Bosnians. I would like to respond to that. While we read and \nheard reports that Iran was smuggling arms to the Bosnians, we did not \nknow the President and his advisers made a conscious decision to give a \ngreen light for Iran to provide arms. Indeed, those of us who advocated \nlifting the arms embargo--Republicans and Democrats--argued that if \nAmerica did not provide Bosnia with assistance, Iran would be Bosnia's \nonly option. In my view, the role of the President and administration \nofficials in this matter need to be examined--even if we do not receive \ncooperation from the White House and the Intelligence Oversight Board--\nwhich has been the case to date.\n\n  In the meeting I held with the four committee chairmen today, we \ndecided on the approach we would take. The Intelligence Committee will \ninvestigate the matter of whether any administration officials were \nengaged in covert action. The Foreign Relations Committee will review \nadministration policy as stated and as executed, as well as the \nramifications of these revelations. Let me tell you why I believe this \nexamination is important.\n  In short, this duplicitous policy has seriously damaged our \ncredibility with our allies. It has also produced one of the most \nserious threats to our military forces in Bosnia and, according to the \nadministration, the main obstacle to the arm and train program for the \nBosnians--I am talking about the presence of Iranian military forces \nand intelligence officials in Bosnia.\n  As I have said many, many times on this floor, along with many of my \ncolleagues on the other side, had we lifted the arms embargo and had we \nprovided the weapons, the Bosnians could have defended themselves and \nchances are there would not have been any American troops there now, \nand we would have had a peace agreement sooner and on better terms for \nthe Bosnians. And most likely, as I said, we would not have 20,000 \nAmericans in Bosnia at this moment. And finally, had we lifted the arms \nembargo on Bosnia, the United States would have done the right thing \nfor the right reason. We would have done it openly, and we would have \ndone it honestly.\n  That is what this examination and these hearings will be about, \nbecause I think we owe it to the American people and we owe it to \nMembers of Congress. As far as I know, no one knew about what was \nhappening. We were told we just could not lift the arms embargo because \nof all the problems that would create with our allies and our \ncredibility at the same time. Apparently some knew it was happening \nthrough the back door.\n  I yield back the remainder of my leader time.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. HATCH. Did the Senator want to comment on the Moynihan amendment?\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I ask unanimous consent that I be given 10 minutes as \nif in morning business to respond to the majority leader on the issue \nof broadcast spectrum auctions.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered. The Senator from South Carolina is recognized.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I thank the distinguished leaders of this measure.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/04/17/senate-section/article/S3445-1", "month": "04", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "17", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3445-S3446]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           TELECOMMUNICATIONS\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I must take exception with the \nstatements by the distinguished majority leader. What really occurred 5 \nyears ago is that hearings both in our Committee of Commerce, which I \nwas chairing at the time, and the Federal Communications Commission as \nto how to bring about high-definition television, going from the analog \nsignal to the high-definition digital television signal--similar to how \nwe went earlier from AM radio to FM radio and we gave away the \nlicenses, and now most of the radio audience predominates in FM.\n  On this particular score, there are all kinds of problems. First, \nthere is a problem faced by the local broadcasters. To change over from \ntheir analog signal to a digital signal is going to be a cost of \nsomewhere between $2 and $10 million. They are not going to put that $2 \nto $10 million in changing over unless and until there are digital TV \nsets. The people who are going to purchase the sets are not going to \npurchase them until the broadcasters bring about digital television.\n\n[[Page S3446]]\n\n  So working as the public body in the public interest, we reasoned, \nafter these hearings, that there ought to be a transition to change \nover, to certainly not penalize established free broadcasts in \nAmerica--it is not a gift, if you please, but, on the contrary, we need \nto get them to switch from analog to digital and then we'll take the \none that they relinquished and auction it. Nobody is getting anything \nfree. It is necessary to bring about that particular switch from the \nanalog to the high-definition television that will truly benefit \nconsumers.\n  Chairman Sikes, a Republican chairman of the Federal Communications \nCommission, enunciated this policy. We had 2 years of hearings in our \nCommerce Committee. We, in a bipartisan fashion, got the movement going \nwith respect to the broadcasters. You have to sort of sell this idea to \nmove them along.\n  We are trying now to get the criteria for high-definition television \nagreed upon by all the technical entities that are interested in this \nparticular move. And the Federal Communications Commission is having \nhearings to determine the technology that should be used. Once that is \ndone this spring, we hope to move forward and, as best we can, \naccelerate this improved television viewing for the American public.\n\n  And now this thing about balancing the budget, this crowd is running \nup $1 billion a day in interest costs. You raise spending $1 billion a \nday while we are talking that you do not want to pay for. I put in a \nvalue-added tax bill to pay for it, but nobody else around here wants \nto pay for it--talking about paying the bills and balancing the budget. \nBut right is right and fair is fair.\n  The broadcasters have not been going around soliciting or asking for \na giveaway of billions of dollars or whatever it is. We have to \nmaintain free over-the-air broadcasting. They used to have almost 100 \npercent of the broadcast audience. They are down to 60 percent. Cable \ntelevision and direct broadcast satellites are taking over and \neverything of that kind. In a very real sense, we are very careful \nabout the regular analog stations that you and I watch every day and \nevery evening.\n  So the air should be clear. You can have 100 hearings. You can go \nback on it. You can come up with the sale and make a lot of money, but \nthe American public is not going to be served. Auctioning the second \nchannel would only disadvantage the American consumer. You should not \nreverse a well-studied and well-thought-out policy by a Republican \nadministration and a Democratic administration, a Republican committee \nand a Democratic committee. We should stick with the FCC plan--it is \nthe best way to ensure free over-the-air television and the taxpayer \nwill benefit when the original channel is auctioned.\n  This peripheral attack about I am Horatio at the bridge here and I am \nstanding up and I am protecting the public, and we want to pay the \nbills and we want to balance the budget, is all hogwash. If you want to \npay bills, then I say to the Senator, it is in your Finance Committee. \nPull it out of the Finance Committee and let's vote up and down, \nbecause you cannot balance the budget without increasing taxes.\n  I will make my challenge one more time. I make it time and again. I \nwould be delighted to jump off the Capitol dome if you can give me a 7-\nyear balanced budget without increasing taxes. You cannot do it. I gave \nthat to the distinguished chairman of the Budget Committee, and he did \nnot do it. That was over a year ago. And I am still ready to jump.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah has 15 minutes.\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent I might have 2 \nminutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? The Chair hears none, and \nit is so ordered. The Senator from Kentucky has 2 minutes.\n  Mr. FORD. I thank the Chair, and I thank my friend from Utah.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/04/17/senate-section/article/S3445-2", "month": "04", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "17", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3446]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          GAGGING OF A SENATOR\n\n  Mr. FORD.

Mr. President, for my friend from New York, I will just \nmove to table this amendment. But I think, because he approaches things \nin such a scholarly manner, I should take just a few minutes to explain \nwhy we cannot accept his amendment and why I will move to table.\n  Mr. President, I think that part of the disagreement we have with \nrespect to the appropriate standard of review in habeas petitions \ninvolves differing visions as to the proper role of habeas review.\n  Federal habeas review takes place only after there has been a trial, \ndirect review by a State appellate court, a second review by a State \nsupreme court, and than a petition to the U.S. Supreme Court. Thus we \nhave a trial and at least three levels of appellate review. In a \ncapital case, the petitioner often files a clemency petition, so the \nState executive branch also has an opportunity to review the case.\n  But that is not the end. In virtually every State, a postconviction \ncollateral proceeding exists. In other words, the prisoner can file a \nhabeas corpus petition in State court. That petition is routinely \nsubject to appellate review by an intermediate court and the State \nsupreme court. The prisoner may then file a second petition in the U.S. \nSupreme Court, and may also, of course, seek a second review by the \nGovernor.\n  So, after conviction, we have at least six levels of review by State \ncourts and two rounds of review--at least in capital cases--by the \nState executive. Contrary to the impression that may be left by some of \nmy colleagues, Federal habeas review does not take place until well \nafter conviction and numerous rounds of direct and collateral review.\n  The Supreme Court has clearly held that habeas review is not an \nessential prerequisite to conviction. Indeed, this very term, the \nSupreme Court reaffirmed the principle that the Constitution does not \neven require direct review as a prerequisite for a valid conviction.\n  Now that we have set the proper context for this debate, let us just \nlook at the proposed standard. Under the standard contained in the \nbill, Federal courts would be required to defer to the determinations \nof State courts unless the State court's decision was ``contrary to, or \ninvolved an unreasonable application of, clearly established federal \nlaw, as determined by the Supreme Court . . . .''\n  This is a wholly appropriate standard. It enables the Federal court \nto overturn State court decisions that clearly contravene Federal law. \nIndeed, this standard essentially gives the Federal court the authority \nto review, de novo, whether the State court decided the claim in \ncontravention of Federal law.\n  Moreover, the review standard proposed allows the Federal courts to \nreview State court decisions that improperly apply clearly established \nFederal law. In other words, if the State court unreasonably applied \nFederal laws, its determination is subject to review by the Federal \ncourts.\n  What does this mean? It means that if the State court reasonably \napplied Federal law, its decision must be upheld. Why is this a \nproblematic standard? After all, Federal habeas review exists to \ncorrect fundamental defects in the law. After the State court\n\n[[Page S3447]]\n\nhas reasonably applied Federal law, it is hard to say that a \nfundamental defect exists.\n  The Supreme Court, in Harlow versus Fitzgerald, has held that if the \npolice officers' conduct was reasonable, no claim for damages under \nBivens can be maintained. In Leon versus United States, the Supreme \nCourt held that if the police officers' conduct in conducting a search \nwas reasonable, no fourth amendment violation would obtain and the \nCourt could not order suppression of evidence obtained as a result of \nthe search. The Supreme Court has repeatedly endorsed the principal \nthat no remedy is available where the Government acts reasonably.\n  Why then, given this preference for reasonableness in the law, should \nwe empower a Federal court to reverse a State court's reasonable \napplication of Federal law to the facts?\n  Our proposed standard simply ends the improper review of State court \ndecisions. After all, State courts are required to uphold the \nConstitution and to faithfully apply Federal laws. There is simply no \nreason that Federal courts should have the ability to virtually retry \ncases that have been properly adjudicated by our State courts.\n  I think that once we cut away the camouflage surrounding the \narguments against our proposed habeas reform package, we find two \nthings: First, a disagreement with the death penalty as a punishment. \nThat is a legitimate disagreement. I, personally, am in favor of the \ndeath penalty, but I would very sparingly use it. But there are others \nwho very sincerely believe that the death penalty is wrong. I can \nunderstand that. Many people have moral or ethical concerns about the \ndeath penalty, and many more in this country, the vast majority, \nbelieve we should have a death penalty for the most heinous murders and \ncrimes in our society. I am appreciative, though, and sensitive to the \nconcerns of others who feel otherwise. Many of my colleagues have \nheartfelt views on this matter, and I respect the sincerity of those \nviews.\n\n  But if the arguments against meaningful habeas reform are in reality \narguments against the death penalty, then let us debate the efficacy of \nthe death penalty. Let us decide whether death is the appropriate \nsanction for people like those who murdered the 168 individuals in \nOklahoma City. I am prepared to debate the point. But let us not \ndisguise this argument.\n  The second argument I think my friends are making is that they \nfundamentally distrust the decisions of State courts. They believe that \nState courts are somehow incompetent to try important cases. They \nbelieve that State juries are somehow not as good as Federal juries; \nthat State court judges are not as qualified as Federal judges; that \nState prosecutors and defense attorneys are not as adept as their \nFederal counterparts. Although I generally disagree with this argument, \nI can understand it. I can debate it. I can argue about the merits of \nhaving State criminal justice systems at all. I can debate the issue of \nwhether something magical happens when a State court judge becomes a \nFederal judge. But if this is what really concerns the opponents to the \nhabeas reform, then let us debate the point straight up. We should not \nallow this debate to be derailed.\n  My good friend, the Senator from New York, referred to the Great \nWrit, which is part of the Constitution. He need not fear for the Great \nWrit, if this proposal is enacted, in other words, if our bill is \nenacted. The Great Writ of Habeas Corpus contained in the Constitution \napplied to only two circumstances: No. 1, to challenge an illegal \nimprisonment before trial; and, No. 2, to determine whether the trial \ncourt had jurisdiction to hear the case.\n  The habeas corpus we are reforming is the statutory form of habeas \ncorpus. There are some in this body who oppose such reform. I believe \nthey are motivated in part, in major part, by their desire to stop the \ndeath penalty or to oppose the death penalty. I can understand that \nposition, although I disagree with it, and I think the vast majority of \nAmericans disagree with it.\n  I believe convicted killers should be punished, and the particularly \nheinous killings ought to be punished with the death penalty. I think \nthe survivors and family, the victims of this type of heinous murder, \nhave a right to see that those who killed their loved ones are justly \npunished. That is why we have to pass this provision. It is long \noverdue.\n  To me, and I think to many others, almost everybody in law \nenforcement today, the habeas corpus provision that we have in this \nbill is a good one. The standard is a good one. The deference to State \nlaw is good, because it just means that we defer to them if they have \nproperly applied Federal law. We should not give some judge who hates \nthe death penalty a right to disrupt that whole process when there is \nno legal justification for doing so. Frankly, we have allowed the \nprocedural justifications to exist for far too long and that is what \nthis is all about.\n  So, having said that, I have letters from all kinds of law \nenforcement organizations, including some organizations that have \nfought for civil liberties all of their existence, that support our \nhabeas corpus reform because it is time to have that in law. It is time \nto get rid of the charade. They support the habeas corpus reform more \nthan any--or the death penalty reform, more than any other provision in \nthis bill, although there are many good provisions in this bill.\n  Having said all that, I am prepared to yield back the remainder of my \ntime, and, on behalf of Senator Dole and myself, I move to table the \namendment and ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Abraham). Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, might I ask for 30 seconds to thank my \nfriend and respond?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York is recognized.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I thank him for his thoughtful, careful \nresponse. I would like to make the point that my concern is not with \nthe death penalty but with habeas corpus itself. I have had a long \nexperience, as the manager has had, with problems of terrorism. As I \nsaid a moment ago, the only time the terrorists ever win is when they \nbegin to make you change your own fundamental political and judicial \nprocesses, and that is what I fear this will do. It is of some relief \nto hear the distinguished manager's statement that the Great Writ will \nremain substantially intact.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, if I can have 30 seconds. The Great Writ \nwill not be affected by this one bit. I appreciate his concerns, and I \nbelieve he will find this provision will help us in fighting violent \ncriminals.\n  So I move to table the motion. I believe we have the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the motion to \nlay on the table the motion to recommit.\n  The yeas and nays have been ordered.

Mr. President, I move to recommit the conference report on \nthe bill S. 735 to the committee of conference with instructions to the \nmanagers on the part of the Senate to disagree to the conference \nsubstitute recommended by the committee of conference and insist on \ninserting the following language to prohibit the distribution of \ninformation relating to explosive materials for a criminal purposes.\n  I send the motion to the desk.\n  The motion is as follows:\n\n       Motion to recommit the conference report on the bill S. 735 \n     to the committee of conference with instructions to the \n     managers on the part of the Senate to disagree to the \n     conference substitute recommended by the committee of \n     conference and insist on inserting the following:\n\n     SEC.   . PROHIBITION ON DISTRIBUTION OF INFORMATION RELATING \n                   TO EXPLOSIVE MATERIALS FOR A CRIMINAL PURPOSE.\n\n       (a) Section 842 of title 18, United States Code, is amended \n     by adding at the end the following new subsection:\n       ``(1) It shall be unlawful for any person to teach or \n     demonstrate the making of explosive materials, or to \n     distribute by any means information pertaining to, in whole \n     or in part, the manufacture of explosive materials, if the \n     person intends or knows, that such explosive materials or \n     information will be used for, or in furtherance of, an \n     activity that constitutes a Federal criminal offense or a \n     criminal purpose affecting interstate commerce.''.\n       (b) Section 844 of title 18, United States Code, is amended \n     by designating subsection (a) as subsection (a)(1) and by \n     adding the following new subsection:\n       ``(a)(2) Any person who violates subsection (1) of section \n     842 of this chapter shall be fined under this title or \n     imprisoned not more than twenty years, or both.''.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I yield myself such time as I may use \nwithin the limit of the time I have.\n  This provision is very straightforward and simple. It is beyond me \nwhy it was taken out of the Senate version of the language that was \nsent to the House.\n  I have heard many colleagues stand up on the floor here and rail \nagainst pornography on the Internet, and for good reason. Even when we \nthought we had corrected the language that Senator Exon introduced to \ncomport with the first amendment, I still hear in my State, and I hear \nof people writing about how so and so is promoting pornography on the \nInternet because they will not ban pornography on the Internet.\n  Yet, in the bill, we came along--all of us here--and the genesis of \nthis came from Senator Feinstein, when it was initially offered. The \nmajority leader, Senator Hatch, and I had some concerns with this, and \nwe thought the language to ban teaching people how to make bombs on the \nInternet or engage in terrorist activities on the Internet might \nviolate the first amendment. Senators Dole, Hatch, and I worked to \ntighten the language and came up with language that was tough and true \nto civil liberties. It was accepted by unanimous consent.\n  We have all heard about the bone-chilling information making its way \nover the Internet, about explicit instructions about how to detonate \npipe bombs and even, if you can believe it, baby food bombs. Senator \nFeinstein quoted an Internet posting that detailed how to build and \nexplode one of these things, which concludes that ``If the explosion \ndon't get'em, the glass will. If the glass don't get'em, the nails \nwill.''\n  I would like to give you a couple of illustrations of the kinds of \nthings that come across the Internet. This is one I have in my hand \nwhich was downloaded. It said, ``Baby food bombs by War Master.'' And \nthis is actually downloaded off the Internet. It says:\n\n       These simple, powerful bombs are not very well known, even \n     though all of the materials can be obtained by anyone \n     (including minors). These things are so--\n\n  I will delete a word because it is an obscenity.\n\n       powerful that they can destroy a CAR. The explosion can \n     actually twist and mangle the frame. They are extremely \n     deadly and can very easily kill you and blow the side of a \n     house out if you mess up while building it. Here is how they \n     work.\n\n  This is on the Internet now. It says:\n\n       Go to Sports Authority or Herman's Sport Shop and \n     buy shotgun shells. It is by the hunting section. At the \n     Sports Authority that I go to you can actually buy shotgun \n     shells without a parent or an adult. They don't keep it \n     behind the glass counter, or anything like that. It is \n     $2.96 for 25 shells.\n\n  And then it says:\n\n       Now for the hard part. You must cut open the plastic \n     housing of the bullet to get to the sweet nectar that is the \n     gun powder. The place where you can cut is CRUCIAL. It means \n     a difference between it blowing up in your face or not.\n\n  Then there is a diagram, which is shown as to how to do that on the \nInternet. Then it says:\n\n       You must not make the cut directly where the gun powder is, \n     or it will explode. You cut it where the pellets are.\n\n  And then it goes through this in detail. And then it gets to the end, \nand it says:\n\n       Did I mention that this is also highly illegal? Unimportant \n     stuff that is cool to know.\n\n  And then it rates shotgun shells by two numbers, gauge, pellet size, \nand goes into great detail. It is like building an erector set. It does \nit in detail.\n  So what Senators Dole and Hatch and I did, we said you should not be \nable to do this, but we have a first amendment problem, possibly. So we \nadded a provision that says that you have to have the intent, when you \nare teaching people how to do this, that the person using it is using \nit for the purpose of doing harm.\n  So it seems to me that this is pretty straightforward. Granted, I \nwant to stop pornography on the Internet. I think pornography does harm \nto the minds of the people who observe it, particularly young people. \nBut if that does harm, how much harm is done by teaching a 15-year-old \nkid, a 12-year-old kid, or a 20-year-old person, with great detail, how \nto build a baby food bomb, or how to build an automatic particle \nexplosion provision, or how to build light bulb bombs.\n  It says:\n\n       An automatic reaction to walking into a dark room is to \n     turn on the light. This can be fatal if a light-bulb bomb has \n     been placed in the overhead light socket. A light-bulb bomb \n     is surprisingly easy to make. It also comes with its own \n     initiator and electric ignition system. On some light-bulbs, \n     the light-bulb glass can be removed from the metal base by \n     heating the base of the light bulb in a glass flame, such as \n     that of a blowtorch and a gas stove.\n\n  And so on and so forth. It goes on to explain how if you attach a \nplastic back to the light bulb when you remove the glass part but leave \nthe filament and attach it and tape it there, when someone comes in and \nturns on the light, it blows up the room. Or, if you want to just play \na prank, you could put odorous, smelling materials in the bag. It would \nblow up the bag. But you can put anything in it, and it blows it up.\n  We said in the language we passed that it shall be unlawful for any \nperson to teach or demonstrate the making of explosive materials, or to \ndistribute by any means information pertaining to, in whole or in part, \nthe manufacture of explosive materials if the person intends or knows \nthat such explosive material, or information will be used for, or in \nthe furtherance of, activity that constitutes a Federal criminal \noffense, or a criminal purpose affecting interstate commerce. And the \nHouse took it out. The House removed it.\n  I want to say to all of you who are going to probably vote down my \nputting this back in, I want to hear you explain to your folks back \nhome when a commercial is run on your television station that Senator \nJones or Senator whoever voted against prohibiting on the Internet \nexplicit directions how to make a bomb knowing that the person intends \nto use it. I want to hear your\n\n[[Page S3449]]\n\nexplanation of that. I want to be there when you explain that one.\n  Let me read the statute again. It says: It shall be unlawful for a \nperson to teach or demonstrate, et cetera, if the person intends or \nknows that such explosive material or information will be used for, or \nin the furtherance of, activity that constitutes a Federal crime. \n``Knows or intends'' is a pretty a high standard falling, in my view, \nand in the view of constitutional scholars, well within our first \namendment privileges. I just think this is crazy.\n  Let me go on just a few more moments, and then I will stop. The \nprovision is pretty straightforward. If you are one of the guys who has \nmade a name for himself by bringing manifestoes like ``The Terrorist \nHandbook'' or ``How to Kill With Joy,'' which literally are on the \nInternet, and if someone comes to you and says, ``Tomorrow morning a \ngroup of police officers are going to be meeting at the Fifth Street \nprecinct, and I want to blow them up,'' and if you say to them, ``Here, \nlet me tell you how to make a bomb,'' arguably at that point the police \ncan get you on a conspiracy charge. That is possible. That is possible. \nBut if you just know what they are about, you see them all out there in \na car, you look down and see that they have this plan, and you go ahead \nand tell them how to make a bomb, it is not a violation of the law to \nteach them how to make the bomb. Is not that incredible?\n\n  Last June, all of us in this body agreed to this. I hope we will \nagree to it again because let me tell you, if this will kill the bill, \nas I am sure my colleague from Utah is going to say it will, I want to \nhear--if this is the only change in the bill--I want to see those House \nMembers stand up and say, ``The reason I am not voting for this \nterrorist legislation is because I want to continue to allow people to \nteach people how to make bombs,'' knowing that they are going to be \nused to commit a crime or kill someone, ``And that is why I am voting \nagainst this bill,'' because it now contains a provision that prohibits \nthat, I think maybe this is time to face down some of those people over \nthere. Let them stand up and tell all of our colleagues around the \nNation, and tell the parents around the Nation, that that is the reason \nthey are voting against the terrorism bill.\n  I retain the remainder of my time and yield the floor.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I will only take a couple of minutes, and \nthen I am prepared to yield back the remainder of my time.\n  The constitution of conspiracy to use an explosive to commit a felony \nis already provided for in precedent law, 18 U.S.C. 844(h). Thus, \nanyone who trains a terrorist to make a bomb as part of such a \nconspiracy would certainly be prosecuted under current law.\n  I want to make it clear that I do not entirely disagree with Senator \nBiden's position. However, we have been facing down this problem for a \nyear now. Friday is the day where we commemorate this awful tragedy. \nFrankly, we have gone through every detail in this bill, and we have \nnot been able to get it exactly to Senator Biden's desire, or even \nmine, but this is it. This is the bill. And anything short of this is \ngoing to amount to losing the bill.\n  Like I said, I do not entirely disagree with Senator Biden's \nposition. However, there are many who have raised first amendment and \nintellectual property concerns about this provision. They are \nlegitimate concerns. As the chairman of the Judiciary Committee, which \nhandles all of the patents, copyrights, and trademark issues, I can say \nthey are legitimate. So, consequently, we have included a study in the \nbill to ensure that we can criminalize efforts to distribute bombmaking \nmaterials without impinging upon constitutional freedoms. Besides, \nthere is little doubt that anyone who knowingly transmits information \nto use explosives to commit a felony is already subject to Federal law; \n18 U.S.C. 844(h) does that.\n\n  So, frankly, I would like to accommodate the distinguished Senator \nfrom Delaware, but we tried to and we have been unable to accommodate \nhim. Frankly, I contend that any return to the conference will kill \nthis bill.\n  I am prepared to yield. I apologize for not being able to do more. \nBut we think we have brought this bill back to a very, very strong \nlevel, and we have had a lot of cooperation with Members of the House \nin doing so and the leadership on the Judiciary Committee--both \nDemocrats and Republicans.\n  Yes, it is not a bill that any one of us in here thinks is totally \nwhat we want, but I think the vast majority of us will believe that it \nis a pretty darned good bill that is going to make a real dent in \nterrorist activities in the future and will, I think, correct some \ninequities of terrorist activities in the past.\n  So I am prepared to yield the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, let me respond about this conspiracy. I \nacknowledge that, if, in fact, there is an agreement with the \nbombmaker, the bomb teacher, and the bomb user, and they could prove \nthat, then they can get the bomb teacher as part of this conspiracy. \nThat is not how this happens. The way it happens is someone walks in \ntelling me--and looking like they are something out of a movie--telling \nme, and I do not know them, that they want to learn how to make a \nfertilizer bomb. ``I want to learn how to make a bomb out of baby food, \na baby-food bomb, or a light-bulb bomb''--that is all they tell me, and \nI do not know them from Adam. I sit down and tell them how to make the \nbomb. The ability to prove that there was a conspiracy to commit a \ncrime requires that there be an ability to be an agreement between the \ntwo of us about the crime that was about to be committed.\n  I am saying it should be a national crime if you intend, or you know \nthe person is about to do something wrong regardless of whether you \nknow what the crime is, what they are going to do with it. Obviously, \nif a 14-year-old kid comes to you and says, ``By the way, I want to \nlearn how to make a baby-food bomb that has the ability to blow up, has \nthe power, like advertised here, that can bend the frame of a car,'' \nyou are telling me that you have to be able to prove conspiracy. If the \nguy says, ``I am happy to show you how to make that, just like I can \nshow you how to make a rocket in the field for a science class,'' there \nis no distinction. And under this law, there is no conspiracy.\n  You vote against this, and it means someone can show a kid how to do \nthat and not have to wonder why this kid is asking me how to make a \npowerful bomb that can bend the frame of a car. You cannot prove \nconspiracy. But it should be wrong. It should be wrong. And how any of \nyou can vote here and say that is not wrong is beyond me.\n  I think it is about time we make some of those people hiding over in \nthe House side stand up. Make them stand up.\n  I want to be there when some punk on the New York subway decides he \nwants a baby food bomb just for the kicks of it, just to see what it is \nlike, and sets it off. You mean to tell me when we find the guy who \ntaught him how to do it, we should say, ``No problem; you didn't do \nanything wrong. It's OK; no problem.'' I think we should throw the \nsucker in jail.\n  I cannot understand how you all can vote against this. I understand \nthe rationale. The rationale in part is 35 House Members, or 75 House \nMembers or 99 House Members will turn down the whole bill because of \nthis. I do not believe for 1 second that if this single provision were \nadded to the bill, with all the stuff they have on habeas corpus they \nwant, with all the other stuff they say they want, they are going to \nvote down this bill because now you are going to be able to arrest some \nwacko teaching our kids how to make bombs when you know they are going \nto use them. I cannot believe that. I think we are being cowardly in \nour willingness to confront whoever the cowards are over there who will \nnot allow us to protect ourselves. This is crazy.\n  I yield the floor. I yield back my time. I am ready to vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Inhofe). The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. BIDEN. That is a good reason to do it.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I hear the Senator. I do really think, \nthough, we ought to consider winding this up. Personally, I think there \ncomes a time when enough is enough on these motions to recommit because \nwhat we are trying to do is to get this bill through. Frankly, we have \npeople in the House on both extremes, both the far left and far right, \nwho disagree on some of these things. I do not think it is unreasonable \nto request a study so that we\n\n[[Page S3450]]\n\nlook at this matter, consider the first amendment implications and \nother implications and do it right, although I have some sympathy with \nwhat the Senator said.\n  I am prepared to yield back the remainder of my time, and I move to \ntable.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I yield myself 20 seconds on the bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has that right.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, no one asked for a study on pornography. No \none asked for that. I did not hear anybody stand up here and say, \n``Let's have a study on pornography. I wish to stop pornography on the \nInternet.'' I did not hear anybody say, ``Let's not do it. Let's have a \nstudy.'' When it comes to a bomb, teaching our kids how to make bombs, \nwe want to study it.\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, like I say, I am sympathetic to what the \nSenator is trying to do. He knows that. But he also knows that we have \ngone through this and we have come up with this bill after a year of \nintensive battling, fighting. And it is not just the conservatives that \nwere there; it is the far left.\n  We have worked hard on this, and this is the bill we could come up \nwith. Do we want to do something about terrorism or do we want to kill \nthe bill? That is what it comes down to. Frankly, it is not just any \none of these things. It could be any one of these things. We have \nworked it out. It is a good bill, and it will make a difference. It \nwill start fighting terrorism right now. In the end, it seems to me if \nwe can ever get to a final vote on this, we will have something of \nwhich virtually everybody who thinks about it will be proud.\n  So I move to table the motion on behalf of Senator Dole and myself \nand ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question now occurs on agreeing to the \nmotion to table the motion to recommit. The yeas and nays have been \nordered. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. LOTT. I announce that the Senator from Florida [Mr. Mack] is \nnecessarily absent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A resolution (S. Res. 246) to authorize the use of \n     additional funds for salaries and expenses of the Special \n     Committee to Investigate Whitewater Development Corporation \n     and related matters, and for other purposes.\n\n  The Senate proceeded to consider the resolution.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, the Senate is about to reauthorize the \nspecial committee's operations for a specific, limited period.\n  It is my understanding, and that of all my colleagues on this side of \nthe aisle, that the special committee will conclude its hearing \nschedule no later than June 14, 1996, and further, that no other \ncommittee of the Senate intends to hold hearings on Whitewater-related \nmatters thereafter. I have also discussed with the majority leader and \nwill commit to him that it is not the intention of Members on this side \nof the aisle to object to the special committee meeting under the \nprovisions of rule XXVI nor to obstruct the special committee's \nprogress, thereby preventing them from completing their work pursuant \nto the latest deadlines outlined in this resolution.\n  It is the further understanding on this side that the report of the \nspecial committee, required to be submitted to the Senate pursuant to \nSenate Resolution 120, will be submitted no later than the close of \nbusiness on June 17, 1996.\n  It is also our understanding that the majority leader does not \nbelieve any amendments, motions, or resolutions will be offered in the \nSenate regarding further extensions of the operations of the special \ncommittee beyond June 17, 1996.\n  Mr. President, I ask the distinguished majority leader whether I have \ncorrectly stated the situation as he now sees it?\n  Mr. DOLE. The Senator has correctly stated the understandings on both \nsides of the aisle as I see it at this time.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the resolution be agreed \nto and the motion to reconsider be laid upon the table.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  So the resolution (S. Res. 246) was agreed to, as follows:\n\n                              S. Res. 246\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, I understand Senator D'Amato and Senator \nSarbanes may want to speak briefly.\n  Mr. D'AMATO addressed the Chair.\n\n[[Page S3451]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, let me just take several moments to thank \nthe distinguished leaders, the majority leader and the minority leader, \nand a number of my colleagues on the Banking Committee on both sides of \nthe aisle for helping us arrive at an agreement that will permit the \nbusiness of the Senate to be conducted in an orderly, thoughtful, \nthorough fashion so that we can complete the work of the Whitewater \nCommittee in a timely manner, recognizing that we are fast \napproaching--we are already in--the political season, but that season \nbecomes even more and more political as the days and weeks move ahead.\n  It is my hope that working together, as we have in most of our \nundertakings on the Banking Committee and on the special Whitewater \nCommittee, we can handle the matters that come before us, even those \nthat may be somewhat contentious, in a bipartisan manner.\n  Ours was to get the facts. Ours is to report back to the Senate of \nthe United States as best we can. Ours is not to prejudge. Ours is not \nto preclude. But ours is to be the searcher of facts, again, given the \nlimitations that exist. It does not pay for us to go into what the \nlimitations are. I must say that there are those areas beyond the \nability of the Senate and its investigation to control or to deal with \nas it relates to time, availability of witnesses, et cetera.\n  So, recognizing those, we may never be able to satisfactorily \ncomplete the job of getting all of the facts or determining all of \nthem, recognizing the limitations that we have. But I think if we do \nthe best we possibly can, if we work together in the spirit of people \nwho are willing to understand each other's problems, the limitations \nthat we do have on us, ours will be an important task, it will not be \nan easy task, but it will be one that we can attempt to fulfill and \nmeet the mandates of the Senate and, indeed, of the Constitution and, \nmore importantly, of our people. We are going to be thorough, \ncomprehensive, but yet fair.\n  Let me conclude by saying that I hope that we can finish by the 14th \nof June. That is the time which we have spelled out. I believe that \nreasonably, if we see that there are matters that are yet to be \naddressed that are important, that are substantial, that we can come to \nan accommodation to deal with that. It is my hope, though, that we will \nbe able to deal with this, conclude the public hearings by the 14th of \nJune, and thereafter have our report within the 3 days that we have \nprovided.\n  I believe this is the best manner in which to proceed, less in the \nway of contention. I certainly hope--as my colleagues have, my \nDemocratic colleagues have helped and assisted in arriving at this \nagreement--that they will work with us. We pledge to work with them to \nget all of those concerns, all of those people that we wish to get \nevidence from, testimony from, to be as cooperative and to use the good \noffices of my colleagues on the Democratic side to accomplish this \ngoal.\n  So I want to commend both leaders. I want to thank Senator Sarbanes, \nSenator Dodd, the other members, the Republican members, of the \ncommittee for being patient, for being thoughtful, and doing a very \ndifficult process. I believe that the agreement that we have hammered \nout is in the best interest of the Senate and, more importantly, the \npeople of the United States. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. SARBANES addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland is recognized.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, let me say that the resolution which has \njust been passed represents a great deal of effort over a considerable \nperiod of time and obviously encompassed accommodations and adjustments \non both sides and from many parties. I believe the resolution provides \nus now with the framework for the completion of the work of the special \ncommittee on Whitewater. The resolution requires the submission of the \nspecial committee's final public report by the 17th of June, and \nprovides a budget to carry forward this work which we believe is \nadequate for the task. It provides for the hearings to end by the 14th \nof June.\n  I must say, I hope, as the chairman has stated, that we are able to \nconduct through this period of time fair and thorough and objective \nhearings.\n  The chairman is right, an effort has been made to do that in the \npast, I think with a fair amount of success, although as he observed we \nhave had on occasion perhaps strayed off that path somewhat. I hope we \ndo not, as we move forward now from today into the middle of June.\n  Many people contributed to making this possible. I want to recognize \nthe contributions of the colleagues on my side, Senators Dodd and Bryan \nand Boxer and Murray and Moseley-Braun and Kerry and Simon and, of \ncourse, the chairman and his colleagues who have worked on this. And, \nof course, the two leaders have been involved to some extent in order \nto bring this matter to this point.\n  The committee back in January, pursuant to the previous resolution, \nwas required to report to the Senate about whether additional time was \nneeded. At the time, there was a difference of opinion about that. The \nmajority said additional time was needed; the minority felt not. We had \na sharp difference about that. The minority leader made a proposition \nfor an extension. The majority, of course, had a resolution before us \nfor an unlimited extension. This, of course, is not an unlimited \nextension, and I think it is very important to recognize that.\n  I simply close by saying that I hope in the weeks to come, now as we \napproach the 17th of June for the submission of the final report, that \nwe will be able to move ahead expeditiously with our work. It is the \nintention of the minority to seek to work in a constructive way with \nthe majority to carry out these hearings in a responsible manner, not \nreally to explore allegations, not to make allegations, but to carry \nout the kind of hearings for which the Senate can take some measure of \ncomfort that it has been done according to appropriate standards. Mr. \nPresident, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DODD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I want to join my colleague from Maryland in \nthanking our colleague from New York, the chairman of the committee, \nand others for putting this together. I want to commend as well my \ncolleague from Maryland, who has done a very fine job in helping to \nfashion this resolution. I join with him and the chairman of the \ncommittee and others in hoping that we will be able now over the next \nseveral weeks to conduct a thorough and complete and fair \ninvestigation.\n  I will say, Mr. President, there are many people, of course, on this \nside of the aisle who, frankly, in fact, may have voted, if there were \na recorded vote, may have voted even against that resolution, who felt \nthat we should have wrapped this up and it is over with. So there is no \nrecorded vote on this, and apparently there will be none. So there will \nbe no actual recording, but Members can obviously speak for themselves. \nI would have voted for this resolution if there was a recorded vote. I \nwant my colleagues to know that.\n  It would not be any great surprise to my colleague from New York if I \nsay to him, Mr. President, that I would do so with great reluctance \nbecause I, frankly, would have liked to wrap this up earlier. So I read \nthis and see this as a determination now to conclude our work by the \n14th of June, with a couple extra days to get our report done. That is \nour goal and our determination. Certainly our colleague from New York \nhas made it clear to us that that is his intent as well. We respect \nthat and take that. The distinguished majority leader has indicated \nthat as well.\n  So we have a lot of work, I know, to do in the coming weeks. But we \nare confident we can do it and bring this to a conclusion. It has been \na long process, Mr. President. I think, as someone pointed out, it may \nbe the longest set of hearings in the history of the Congress on a \nparticular matter like this. Someone may challenge that, but certainly \nin modern Senate history, I think, the longest record, the longest set \nof hearings, at great cost. I am not speaking now exclusively of our \nwork here, but the overall investigation. So the American public, I \nthink, wants us to complete our work on this.\n  Also, I point out that because this is a special committee but made \nup primarily of members of the Banking Committee--of course, the \nchairman is\n\n[[Page S3452]]\n\nthe chairman of the Banking Committee as well--there is a great deal of \nwork we have to do on the Banking Committee before this Congress ends. \nOur colleague from California has a number of issues that she is \ninterested in. Senator Murray, from the State of Washington, has \nmentioned several issues she is interested in, along with our colleague \nfrom Maryland and others.\n  So our sincere hope is that not only will we get this done, I say to \nour colleagues--I know many are asking the question: Are you really \ngoing to get your work done? I am saying here we are going to have this \ndone on June 14, a report several days afterward, and our Banking \nCommittee is also going to get its work done on other issues that have \nbeen raised as well that should be addressed.\n  With that, Mr. President, I commend my colleague from New York, my \ncolleague from Maryland, our ranking member, for bringing this to a \nfinal conclusion. We will have our work done by June 14.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I am not going to belabor the points that \nwere made except to add my thanks to my ranking member, Senator \nSarbanes, and my chairman, Senator D'Amato, for working this out with \nthe able assistance of many people, particularly Senator Dodd.\n  I have always taken the position as long as there are Senators on the \nfloor making it sound like there are issues that are being covered up \nor not looked at, it was very important for us to continue, because \nfrankly, I think we have had a sufficient amount of time. We have had \nmore days of hearings than the O.J. Simpson trial. The fact is, this \nhas gone on endlessly.\n  The people in California, and I cannot speak for the people of \nConnecticut or the people from Maryland or the people from New York, \nbut I can say those who came to see me in this 2-week break, not one \nsaid, ``Senator, the one thing I want you to do when you go back is \nhold more hearings on Whitewater.'' Not one person. No Republican came \nup and told me that. They never even mentioned it. They did say, ``Go \nback and get the job done. Balance the budget. Pass a budget. Do not \ncut Medicare. Take care of education. Go after the situation in our \nexports where we have problems with nations who are not treating us \nfairly.''\n  I sit on the Banking Committee and we have that jurisdiction. We have \nnot done a thing about the issues that will make life better for the \npeople of this country. It is Whitewater, Whitewater, Whitewater. What \ndo the people think of it? I tell you what they think of it, they think \nit is a waste of time. They think it is a waste of time. We have a \nspecial counsel who has no limit on what he can spend going after the \ntruth on Whitewater. There is no statute of limitations. We had little \ndiscussion about that earlier in relation to another bill. This special \nprosecutor has the world at his fingertips, and yet we have to call up \nthe same felons, the same felons that are spewing forth things against \nour President, we are going to bring them into the hallowed Halls of \nthe Senate of the United States.\n  People are smart. The American people get it. This Congress has a bad \nreputation among the people. They do not think this Congress is doing \nits job. No wonder. No wonder. So there are a lot of accolades about \nhow great it is that we reached an agreement on this. I say, good, I am \nglad, because the alternative was having this in the Banking Committee \nwhere we would get nothing else done, and waste the time of the Banking \nCommittee.\n  I have a situation in California where we have a great industry which \nis the leader in CD's and laser disks. We are losing billions of \ndollars a year because of China piracy. What are we doing about it in \nthe Banking Committee? Zero--no time. No time. I was encouraged when \nour chairman said that he agreed with me on this issue, and, yes, he \nwill get that done. Well, that is good. I do not know how we will do it \nall, but my view has always been as long as there are allegations made \non this floor that they have not unturned every stone, that I would \nvote to continue this, because the last thing I want is for people to \nthink we are not willing to look.\n  Yes, I would have voted for this, but I have to say I hope we are \nbetter in this phase than we have been before, because there were days \nwhen we were supposed to have hearings and no one showed up. I am here, \nand I know there is a lot of comity on the floor today and everybody is \nthrilled. I am not so thrilled. Yes, I will vote for it, but I think it \nis a waste of time. It is political. Everyone in the country knows it \nis political. They are smart. They know the special prosecutor is out \nthere, and they see Members of the Senate act like prosecutors and \nstaff sitting there like that is their job. If they want to be \nprosecutors, God bless them, be prosecutors. Do not be a U.S. Senator, \nand do not come to work for U.S. Senators, because we have other things \nto do.\n  What we have to do is make life better for the people. It is \nembarrassing. It is embarrassing to me that I sit on one of the best \ncommittees in the U.S. Senate, and this is what we are going to be \ndoing. I am glad we have an end date of June. We can wrap it up and do \nour work. I just hope we get back to the business of making life better \nfor the people of our great Nation, because they deserve our attention. \nThere is economic insecurity out there. There are things we can do in \nthe Banking Committee to get to those issues. I stand ready to work in \na bipartisan way to get to those issues and to move these hearings \nalong.\n  I also have to say just because I am straight from the shoulder about \nthis, that when we have witnesses up there who are convicted felons, I \nhope my colleagues on the other side of the aisle will not be surprised \nif I get a little tough in my questions. I thank the Senator.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I will not delay the Senate. I know that \nMembers would like to get back to the Terrorism Prevention Act.\n  I would like the record to reflect that I did vote against the \nestablishment of the special committee to investigate Whitewater. I \nthink it was not a proper function for the Senate this election year. I \ncertainly would like the Record to reflect had there been a rollcall \nvote on this resolution extending the jurisdiction of that special \ncommittee, I would also vote against this.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, I thank the Chair for recognizing me. I \nwill speak only a very few moments. I know we want to get on with the \nbusiness of the Senate.\n  I want to first commend my colleague, Senator Sarbanes, the ranking \nmember of the committee, and I want to commend the chairman of the \ncommittee for ultimately working out an agreement. Maybe this can be a \nsolution by which we might proceed in an orderly way to end the quest \nto find facts, information, and to educate ourselves on the so-called \nissue of Whitewater.\n  Mr. President, if we had brought this issue to a vote, like my friend \nfrom New Mexico, I probably would have voted ``no''. I probably would \nhave voted ``no'' on this resolution, Mr. President, simply because I \nthink that there are enough forces out there occupying the time and \nresources of our Government and our judicial system to amply comply \nwith the intent of this overall investigation.\n  These hearings have already gone, Mr. President, as my friend from \nCalifornia has stated, longer than the O.J. Simpson trial. Longer, I \nthink, in many instances that the Iran-Contra trial. These were \nnational issues of great importance. This is an issue of some \nimportance, but it is of importance only because it affects what we \nknow as a Whitewater issue. It relates to a matter that took place 12 \nor 15 years ago in the State of Arkansas. How important is it as it \nrelates to the other issues that we have to defend and debate and \nconcern ourselves with at this time? That is the question.\n  I do not feel that the Senate, nor this committee, should further \nutilize the resources of our Government to continue bringing witnesses \nup here from the State of Arkansas, week after week, day after day, and \nmonth after month, simply because it is a politically motivated \nendeavor. Mr. President, that is what it is. It is a politically \nmotivated endeavor.\n  Yesterday, the distinguished chairman of the Banking Committee or the \nWhitewater Committee, if you might\n\n[[Page S3453]]\n\ncall it that, issued a press release in which he basically said if he \ndid not get his way, if he did not have his way and if the Senate did \nnot allow the Whitewater committee to continue--then he would use the \nBanking Committee to usurp the powers of the Whitewater Committee. He \nwas then going to seek the authority to have the opportunity to \ninvestigate and to subpoena all financial records of every financial \ninstitution in the State of Arkansas. from January 1978 until January \n20, 1993, when Governor Clinton became President Clinton.\n\n  Mr. President, had that occurred--and I am glad it did not--and had \nthe Banking Committee singled out one State, I was going to attempt to \namend that resolution, if it was in the form of a resolution, and say, \nwait a minute, let us not just apply this to one State, Arkansas. Do \nnot let this be the first time that a committee of the U.S. Senate has \ndeclared war on one of the States in this Union. Let us make it apply \nto New York, to all the banks and all the banking institutions, to Wall \nStreet, and to the stock exchange. That has not been the prettiest \npicture for the last 15 to 18 years. Let us investigate them. Let us \nextend this authority there and see how far that resolution would have \ngotten.\n  Well, Mr. President, of course, I am using a little bit of \nexaggeration. But I want to state that, for 15 years, had the Banking \nCommittee had that authority to subpoena any and all records and any \nand all documents from all financial institutions in our State, it \nwould have been a matter, I think, of egregious overreach of this body \nand, certainly, of the U.S. Government.\n  Mr. President, further, I would like to state that--and I hope the \nChair will pay close attention to this, as the distinguished Senator \nalways does--we have recently asked the Federal Bureau of Investigation \nto do a little workup of the amount of resources that it has committed \nto the Whitewater issue. I was astounded and shocked when I found out \nwhat the five major ongoing investigations by the Federal Bureau of \nInvestigation are right now. One is Oklahoma City, which takes \npriority. That is where most of the resources have been expended. No. \n2, the Unabomber. Well, it has paid off because we may have caught the \nUnabomber. That is a lot of resources, and that is a proper use of the \nFBI. The third is another bank scandal. I can supply what State that is \nin for the Record. Evidently, a lot of FBI resources are being \nallocated to that particular bank scandal. But the fourth in priority \nof all the investigations where the FBI is allocating its major \nresources is--you guessed it--Whitewater. It even surpasses the \ncommitment that we have made to the World Trade Center bombing by \nterrorists some 2 or 3 years ago. Whitewater has surpassed the use of \nFBI personnel and financial resources, and we have gone above and \nbeyond those funds expended and agents expended to deal with the World \nTrade Center bombing of 2 or 3 years ago.\n  That is unbelievably outrageous. In fact, some $11 million to $12 \nmillion of FBI resources have been expended just on Whitewater--$11 \nmillion to $12 million of FBI personnel, including 41 agents and 81 \nsupport personnel of the Federal Bureau of Investigation are looking at \nWhitewater events that happened 10, 12, 15 years ago.\n  Mr. President, it is time, as other speakers have said, to really get \nour priorities right. I am hopeful that this committee will continue, \nwill move expeditiously, will come to a conclusion, write its report, \nthrow that report at the Congress, and then let us let the people \ndecide what we should do about it.\n  Finally, I want to say that this morning in the New York Times, \nfinally--finally--under an editorial entitled ``Replacing Kenneth \nStarr,'' who is basically the special counsel--or what I call the \n``special prosecutor'' in the Whitewater matter down in Little Rock. \nThe New York Times has asked for Mr. Starr to be replaced. Why have \nthey asked for Mr. Starr to be replaced, Mr. President? Well, it is \nvery simple. It is because Mr. Starr has conflicts of interest, which \nare precluding him from presenting a fair image of investigation and of \nfactfinding in the Whitewater matter. Here is the man who is charged \nwith prosecuting and investigating this issue. But here also is the man \nwho has the burden of bearing these conflicts of interest. The New York \nTimes points out this morning in its editorial ``Replacing Kenneth \nStarr,'' that he is making speeches all over the country, representing \ncontroversial clients before the U.S. Supreme Court, representing, \nperhaps, the national Republican Party, and other groups that have \ndirect conflicts of interest with the fair-mindedness that this hearing \nand process has to portray.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that this editorial, \n``Replacing Kenneth Starr,'' appearing this morning in the New York \nTimes, be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the New York Times, Apr. 17, 1996]\n\n                        Replacing Kenneth Starr\n\n       With a Presidential election only six months away, the \n     public needs to have confidence in the fairness, good \n     judgment and unselfish civic purpose of the independent \n     counsel on Whitewater. It is also important that the months \n     of work by a large, expensive staff not be squandered. After \n     listening to Kenneth Starr's narrow, legalistic reasons for \n     his continued representation of wealthy, politically active \n     clients while serving as independent counsel, we have \n     concluded that Mr. Starr is not the person to deliver on \n     those two goals. It is time for him to step aside and let the \n     investigation go forward under a replacement from the senior \n     staff.\n       Mr. Starr seems defiantly blind to his appearance problems \n     and indifferent to the special obligation he owes to the \n     American people. He and his ethics adviser, Sam Dash, keep \n     pointing out that most of the 16 other people appointed under \n     the independent counsel law have continued to work on private \n     cases. They conveniently ignore the fact that Mr. Starr is \n     one of only two such counsels to be given the task of \n     investigating a sitting President.\n       ``The independent counsel was never expected to become a \n     full-time employee of the Government and leave his or her law \n     firm,'' Mr. Starr told the Federal Bar Association in a \n     haughty speech last week. That could be because never before \n     has a lawyer assigned to investigate high government \n     officials maintained such a conspicuously fast-paced and \n     politically freighted private practice while assuming a major \n     national responsibility.\n       The cumulative weight of Mr. Starr's conflicts have become \n     so heavy that Mr. Dash, the top lawyer for the old Senate \n     Watergate committee, who is paid $3,200 a week to advise Mr. \n     Starr, defends only the formal legality of Mr. Starr's \n     lucrative moonlighting. The law allows the court-appointed \n     prosecutor to have an outside law practice, but Mr. Dash told \n     Jane Mayer of The New Yorker that he would prefer that Mr. \n     Starr serve full time. What the independent counsel is doing \n     is proper, Mr. Dash argued later, but reasonable people may \n     believe ``there's an odor.''\n       Mr. Dash is right about the odor, but wrong about the \n     propriety. The independent counsel law was enacted so the \n     public could be assured that the President would not sway \n     Justice Department officials who work for him. But if the \n     counsel refuses to divest himself of his own political and \n     financial baggage, he erases the gain in public confidence \n     that his appointment is expected to solidify.\n       This page has steadily advocated the continuation of the \n     Whitewater investigation in the belief that the public has \n     the right to know the full facts about the Clinton's business \n     dealings and related matters. But at the very outset, we \n     asked Mr. Starr to step aside because his entanglement with \n     conservative judges cast a shadow over his objectivity. When \n     that did not happen, we urged him to take a leave from his \n     law firm and appoint a deputy to oversee areas of the \n     investigation where he had a clear conflict of interest.\n       But the number of those conflicts--involving big tobacco, \n     conservative foundations, the Resolution Trust Corporation, \n     the International Paper Company--has grown so great that \n     voters are bound to be confused about the integrity of Mr. \n     Starr's decision on whether to prosecute the Clintons and \n     their close associates.\n       There was a time when Mr. Starr could have ameliorated such \n     doubt with openness and a sensitivity to his obligation to \n     the American people. That time is past. He needs to honor the \n     work of his staff and the investment of the taxpayers by \n     stepping down.\n\n  Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, also, let me state that in this New Yorker \nmagazine, dated April 22, I believe--I do not have my glasses with me--\nthere is a splendid article entitled ``How Independent Is the \nCounsel,'' once again, talking about the conflicts, talking about the \nimage that this man who is burdened with these conflicts presents as he \nis attempting to portray that he is fair-minded, objective, and \nimpartial in finding all the facts.\n  It is time, Mr. President, that, once again, we sort of set this ship \nstraight, if I might say that. It is time that we move forward with a \nfair determination of the facts and finding of the\n\n[[Page S3454]]\n\nfacts. I hope the committee will proceed expeditiously. But had I had \nthe opportunity to vote, if it were a matter before this body that \nrequired a yes or no vote, I would have voted ``no.''\n  Mr. HATCH. What is the regular order, Mr. President?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The conference report on S. 735 is the order \nof business.\n  Mr. HATCH. Soon we will proceed on that. But while we are waiting for \nSenator Biden to come, I want to say that I have sat on the Whitewater \ncommittee. I have to say I think it has been conducted very fairly. \nSenator D'Amato has bent over backward to do it fairly. I know our \ncounsel has done a fair and decent job. In fact, I have never seen two \nbetter counsel than the two we have on both the minority and majority \nsides on the Whitewater matter.\n  I also have to say that I hope it is resolved in favor of the \nPresident and First Lady. But there are a lot of things that are very \nmuch up in the air, matters over which we have a great deal of concern. \nYou cannot just sweep them under the rug because it has taken time. \nThere have been obfuscation, delays, and there have been deliberate \nrefusals to give documents, and documents have suddenly appeared. These \ntypes of things do not ordinarily happen. It has been filled with all \nkinds of incidents and occurrences that literally would cause anybody \nto say, ``What is going on here? If there is nothing wrong, why all \nthese problems?'' Personally, it is bothering me.\n  I have to say that I am glad we are getting this on the way to a \nresolution. I hope we can expedite it and do it in a fair and proper \nway, and get it over with one way or the other. I intend to do what I \ncan to insist on doing that.\n  With that, I would like to go to the regular order, and I yield to \nSenator Biden.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/04/17/senate-section/article/S3450-2", "month": "04", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "17", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3454-S3478]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              TERRORISM PREVENTION ACT--CONFERENCE REPORT\n\n  The Senate continued with the consideration of the conference report.\n\n\n                           Motion to Recommit\n\n  Mr. BIDEN.

The time is 30 minutes equally divided.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I yield myself such time as I may consume \nwithin my allotted time.\n  Mr. President, before I begin on this amendment, I want to just tell \nyou, and all of my colleagues who may be listening back in the offices, \nthat while the last vote was going on a colleague of ours, Senator \nWendell Ford, came to the floor and said, ``Let me show you something \nmy staff just downloaded from the Internet.'' While you were all voting \non whether or not to prohibit people from being able to teach people \nhow to make bombs knowing or intending they be used to violate the law, \nlet me read what was downloaded. This is roughly at 3:20 p.m. today.\n\n       Attention all Unabomber wannabes. You will first have to \n     make a mild version of thermite. Use my recipe but substitute \n     iron filings for rust. Mix the iron with aluminum filings in \n     a ratio of 75 percent aluminum, 25 percent iron. This mixture \n     will burn violently in a closed space (such as an envelope). \n     This brings us to the next ingredient. Go to the post office \n     and buy an insulated (padded) envelope. You know, the type \n     that is double layered. Separate the layers and place the \n     mild thermite in the main section where the letter would go. \n     Then place magnesium powder in the outer layer. There is your \n     bomb!!\n       Now to light it. This is the tricky part, and hard to \n     explain.\n\n  I am still quoting now.\n\n       Just keep experimenting until you get something that works. \n     The fuse is just that torch explosive I have told you about \n     in another one of my anarchy files. You might want to wrap it \n     like a long cigarette, then place it at the top of the \n     envelope in the outer layer (on top of the powdered \n     magnesium). When the torch explosive is torn, or even \n     squeezed hard, it will ignite the powdered magnesium (sort of \n     a flash light) and then it will burn the mild thermite. If \n     the thermite did not blow up, it would at least burn your \n     enemy (it does wonders on human flesh).\n\n  You all just voted to keep that legal--to keep that legal--because of \nthe fear, apparently, or concern that we would not be able to convince \n35 recalcitrant House Members to make that illegal. That is what you \ndid. That is what you did.\n  I ask unanimous consent that this be printed in the Record along with \nthe baby food bomb by Warmaster, also taken off the Internet.\n  For all of you who are concerned about the pornography on the \nInternet, as I am, how do you explain banning that, which we should, \nand not this? Pornography deforms the mind. These bombs burn the flesh.\n  I ask unanimous consent that these recipes available to our children \nand the demented people out there in the public, the few that exist, be \nprinted in the Record to know what we have just done.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                    Attention All Unabomber Wannabes\n\n       You will first have to make a mild version of thermite. Use \n     my recipe, but substitute iron fillings for rust. Mix the \n     iron with aluminum fillings in a ratio of 75% aluminum to 25% \n     iron.

Now to light it . . . this is the \n     tricky part and hard to explain. Just keep experimenting \n     until you get something that works. The fuse is just that \n     touch explosive I have told you about in another one of my \n     anarchy files. You might want to wrap it like a long \n     cigarette and then place it at the top of the envelope in the \n     outer layer (on top of the powdered magnesium). When the \n     touch explosive is torn or even squeezed hard it will ignite \n     the powdered magnesium (sort of a flash light) and then it \n     will burn the mild thermite. If the thermite didn't blow up, \n     it would at least burn your enemy (it does wonders on human \n     flesh!).\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n                             Babyfood Bombs\n\n                             (By Warmaster)\n\n       These simple, powerful bombs are not very well known even \n     though all the materials can be easily obtained by anyone \n     (including minors). These things are so powerful that they \n     can DESTROY a car. The explosion can actually twist and \n     mangle the frame. They are extremely deadly and can very \n     easily kill you and blow the side of the house out if you \n     mess up while building it. Here's how they work.\n       Go to Sports Authority or Hermans sport shop and buy \n     shotgun shells. It is by the hunting section. At the Sports \n     Authority that I go to you can actually buy shotgun shells \n     without a parent or adult. They don't keep it behind the \n     little glass counter or anything like that. It is $2.96 for \n     25 shells.\n       Now for the hard part:\n       You must cut open the plastic housing of the bullet to get \n     to the sweet nectar that is the gunpowder. The place where \n     you cut it is CRUCIAL. It means the difference between it \n     blowing up in your face or not.\n       You must not make the cut directly where the gunpowder is \n     or it will explode. You\n\n[[Page S3455]]\n\n     must cut it where the pellets are. When you cut through it, \n     empty the pellets out and the white stuff (called buffer) \n     that surrounds the pellets. There is a layer of wadding that \n     separates the gunpowder from the pellets and that must be cut \n     through VERY CAREFULLY! Don't use a drill! Whatever \n     instrument you use (knife, screwdriver, etc.) you must work \n     very slowly and don't make big movements. Friction can set it \n     off. You now have a nice supply of gunpowder.\n       I have also tried this with Quail Shot. The only difference \n     between buck and quail is that quail has very small pellets \n     and buck has big ones.\n       It is strange but almost all shotgun shells have a \n     different interior. Some have very powdery powder and some \n     have flakes for powder. Also some have plastic wadding and \n     some have cardboard. Usually the smaller the pellets the less \n     gunpowder and more cardboard wadding. The smaller pellet \n     sizes are the ones with the flakes. Also that white stuff \n     called buffer is only used in heavy buckshot and is not found \n     in Quail and Dove shot or other bullets with small pellets.\n       [Contents deleted from original.]\n       I would like to stress once again that this is EXTREMELY \n     dangerous and can very easily kill you. I've done this once \n     and it scared the------out of me and I am never doing it \n     again. These are very destructive. If you are stupid enough \n     to do it, wear two or three pairs of safety glasses and thick \n     clothes to protect you from the glass. The------can still \n     hurt you from 100 feet away. The blast is also deafening. But \n     if you want to spread some choas, this little bomb is the way \n     to go.\n       Did I mention that this is also highly illegal?\n       Unimportant stuff that is cool to know:\n       They rate shotgun shells by two numbers. Gauge and pellet \n     size. With gauge the smaller the number the bigger the bullet \n     (12 gauge is bigger than 14 or 16 gauge). The biggest I know \n     of is 10 gauge, but that is very hard to find. The other \n     number is the pellet size. The bigger the pellet the less can \n     fit in the bullet. The advantage of a big pellet is that it \n     is more powerful but cover an area very scarcely. The smaller \n     pellets have a much lower velocity but there are many more \n     pellets in the shell. Here is how the system goes: 000 \n     buckshot (triple 0) is the very biggest. There are only 10 \n     pellets in it but they are huge. Then comes 00, 0, 1, 2, 3, \n     4, 5, 6, 7. Number 7 has about 200 pellets in it. It is used \n     for squirrels and small birds. Generally the 000, 00, 0, 1, \n     2, 3, and 4 have the best powder. Anything higher up has this \n     weird flakey gunpowder that doesn't work so well.\n       Some Other Things That Smart People Do That Don't Want To \n     Get Killed:\n       Other things you can do with the powder other than use it \n     in a babyfood jar is to use it in a smaller jar. You will get \n     less bang out of it but it is much safer. Some good jars to \n     use are very small makeup jars and those little TESTORS paint \n     bottles. The paint bottles have thick glass and it might be \n     more dangerous. Another thing you can do with the powder is \n     wrap it up tightly in some paper and stick a fuse in it (it \n     is easier to put the fuse in before you wrap the paper).\n       Typed by the Warmaster.\n       The author accepts no responsibility for any misuse of \n     information in this file. This is for information purposes \n     only, and reading enjoyment only, and is meant to show how at \n     any time any lunatic with a mile long police record can \n     legally make a highly powerful bomb with almost no equipment. \n     The author is not advocating the use of explosives in any \n     way.\n\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, what I would like to speak to in an \nindirect way covers this. We have had several votes on wiretaps, and I \nknow people are asking why am I introducing the other wiretap provision \nthat was taken out of the Senate bill. The reason I am is I refuse to \nbelieve that, if you all hear this enough, you will not eventually \ndecide to do the right thing on this.\n  The provision that I have proposed is not original with me. It was in \nthe Senate bill that we passed. The provision would add a number--the \nbill we have before us, the conference report--would add a number of \nterrorism-related offenses to the law. I will go into those in a \nminute. What I have sent to the desk, if adopted, would instruct the \nconferees to add the same number of offenses that we are adding to the \nbill, to the law, to those categories of things for which the \nGovernment, with probable cause, can get a wiretap. It was in the \nSenate bill as introduced by Senators Hatch and Dole. It was part of \nthe terrorism bill reported out of Representative Hyde's Judiciary \nCommittee. Unfortunately, by the time the bill had made it to the \nHouse, the provision was dropped.\n  I think it is worth talking a moment about how a wiretap statute \nworks, the one that is in place now in the law, for it seems there is a \nlot of misunderstanding about it these days. I am repeating myself \nagain to eliminate the misunderstanding. As some people tell it, you \nwould think the FBI and BATF and the local and State police are tapping \nour phones left and right, that they are riding down the streets in \nvans with electronic devices eavesdropping into our windows and \nhouses--which they have the capacity to do, by the way. But that is \njust not the way it works.\n  First and foremost, it is not an FBI agent but a U.S. attorney, or \neven the Attorney General herself, who has the power to authorize the \nwiretap. No. Actually, that is not quite true. The ultimate authority \nto issue a wiretap sits only with a Federal judge. The U.S. attorney \nhas the power to petition the court for a wiretap, but only a judge, a \njudge who cannot be fired, whose salary cannot be docked by any of us \nin Washington, who cannot be affected in any way, only a judge may \ndisagree with something that the Attorney General does or does not do. \nIt is that judge who must determine that there is probable cause to \nbelieve that a specific crime--not a general crime--a specific crime \nhas been--not is about to--has been committed; that specific people are \ncommitting that crime, and that they are doing it at a specific place. \nThe affidavit that the U.S. attorney takes to the court, to the judge, \nmust also satisfy what is called the necessity requirement. The judge \nmust be convinced that other less intrusive investigative procedures \nhave been tried and failed--that is infiltration, that is eavesdropping \nin a conversation, walking by, any other method--has to be convinced \nthat they have been tried and failed or that they are unlikely to \nsucceed in any reasonable circumstance.\n\n  That necessity requirement is meant to ensure that wiretapping is not \nthe normal investigative technique, like physical surveillance or the \nuse of informants. These are very serious protections, Mr. President. I \nbelieve that interposing a court between the prosecutor and the wiretap \nis a citizens' best protection.\n  But even before we get to the judge who makes his decision, there is \na very painstaking, stringent process within the Justice Department for \ndetermining when to seek a court authorization for a wiretap.\n  First, the agent in the field, under the supervision of his or her \nsupervisor, must write an affidavit, a sworn affidavit, that they must \nsign that sets out all the particular facts relating to probable cause, \nbecause even if an order is granted based on the agent, if he is lying, \nthen that information is gone even if the judge issued the wiretap \norder.\n  So, on the front end, you have to have a sworn law enforcement \nofficer swear that the information they are writing down as to why they \nthink a crime has been committed is true. They are liable. An assistant \nU.S. attorney then must take that affidavit from the FBI agent and \ndraft an application and a proposed order for the court to sign. The \npackage then must be sent from the U.S. attorney in Wilmington, DE, or \nin Manchester, NH, and sent down to Washington. The U.S. attorney \ncannot just walk into the courtroom of the Federal judge or to any of \nthe judges, and say, ``Judge, I want a wiretap.'' They must send it \ndown to Washington. Once the package is sent to Washington, the \nCriminal Division of the Justice Department takes a look and \nscrutinizes the affidavit and discusses any necessary changes or \nadditions or questions they have with the U.S. attorney that is \nhandling the case back in Manchester, Wilmington, or Salt Lake City.\n  Then a detailed memorandum summarizing the facts and legal issues and \naddressing the application's compliance with each statutory requirement \nis sent to the Assistant Attorney General. All these materials are then \nsent to the Assistant Attorney General or Deputy Attorney General for \nfinal review and final authorization, and then it is sent back to \nManchester, sent back to Wilmington, sent back to Salt Lake City. The \nU.S. attorney then petitions the court and then goes in and sees a \njudge.\n  This is painstaking. It is time consuming, as well it should be, for \nwe want to make sure that wiretaps are used in only the most serious \ncases. We want to make sure that they are used only as a last resort \nwhen all other less intrusive techniques have failed, and we want to \nmake sure that the Government is not making unwarranted intrusions into \nour privacy. But we also\n\n[[Page S3456]]\n\nneed to make sure that law enforcement has the tools, if they meet all \nthese hurdles, to catch the bad guy.\n  Now, this provision that I have offered, that we already voted on, \nwill provide an important tool. Let me just point out there is \ncurrently a very long list of crimes for which a wiretap can be \nauthorized. Let me make this point because a lot of nonlawyers or \npeople who do not practice criminal law are not aware of this as well.\n  You cannot get a wiretap, even if you do all the things I just said, \nunless you turn to the Criminal Code, and you have all these crimes \nlisted in the Criminal Code. OK. You may find a crime in one section, \nand then you have to turn to another section, section 251, of the \nCriminal Code entitled, ``Authorization for Interception of Wire, Oral \nor Electronic Communications.'' And then you have to find there in \nsubsection (c) the list of offenses for which you can get a wiretap. \nNot every crime is entitled to have a wiretap attached to it.\n  So it is a two-step process. First, you have to prove there is a \ncrime being committed that is a violation of the Federal law. Second, \nyou have to go through all these procedures that I outlined to \nsafeguard that it is not willingly used by the Government to intrude on \nyour privacy. And then, in that process, you have to make sure it is a \nlisted crime for which you can seek a wiretap. OK.\n  Now, some of those crimes for which you can seek a wiretap are \nmurder, kidnaping, robbery, extortion, bribing public officials, \nwitnesses, or bank officials, obstructing justice, criminal \ninvestigations or law enforcement, all manner of fraud and \nembezzlement, destroying cars, wrecking trains. They are all listed, \nall listed. And this list goes on.\n  The provision I am suggesting here does only one minor thing: It \nwould add a very serious and potentially deadly terrorism offense to \nthat list, including new offenses that are added in this legislation. \nThe legislation we are voting on, the conference report is this thing, \nand in here, to the credit of the chairman and I believe to me and \nothers who worked on this, we add new crimes, new Federal crimes, \nterrorism crimes for which the Federal Government can go after you if \nyou do these bad things. But we miss one important step. We do not take \nthese new laws and add them to the list of those things for which you \ncan get a wiretap. This would do that, would allow wiretaps with all \nthe procedures for the new crimes of terrorism we have in here.\n\n  It is ironic. At first I thought it was an oversight, but obviously \nit is intended that you not be able to use wiretaps to deal with \nterrorism as we outlined in the bill.\n  I assume my time has expired.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  Mr. BIDEN. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. HATCH addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah is recognized for 15 \nminutes.\n  Mr. HATCH. We have been doing this for a year. We are trying to pass \na bill here that will make a difference against terrorist crimes. I can \nsay categorically that there is virtually always a way to get wiretaps \nif the prosecution wants it, if the law enforcement people want it. To \njust add the word terrorism, that would be efficacious, but it still \nwould not stop anybody--if you do not add it, it still would not stop \nanybody from getting the necessary wiretaps in the case of suspected \nterrorists.\n  We can overdue these technicalities to the end of the doggone \nCongress. The fact is, this bill contains alien terrorist removal \nprovisions that will make a real difference. It contains designation of \nterrorist organizations that we do not have right now, neither of these \nprovisions, that will make a real difference today. We have Hamas \npeople in this country who want to murder our Jewish citizens, just to \nmention a few. We have Abu Nidal people in this country who want to \nmurder our Jewish citizens and others, do anything to disrupt our \neconomy. We have other terrorist organizations in this country. We have \nat least 1,500 known terrorists and organizations in this country. And \nwe are standing here debating whether or not we should put a word into \nthe bill.\n  Now, I agree I would love to put it in, but in this year-long set of \nnegotiations and work with the other body, they did not want it put in \nthat way. They are concerned that we are expanding wiretapping too far. \nIt is a legitimate concern.\n\n  This world is turned upside down. When I got here 20 years ago, the \nconservatives wanted the wiretapping because they wanted to stop all \ncrimes. The liberals did not want it because they were concerned about \ncivil liberties. I can remember the battles we had in the Judiciary \nCommittee, and they were heated and intense.\n  Today, it is the opposite. The conservatives, some conservatives, \nespecially those on the far right--and I might add, the far left \nliberals still do not want wiretapping, but the far right conservatives \nare concerned because they feel like justice went awry in Waco and Ruby \nRidge, the Good Ol' Boys roundup and other matters. Those are \nlegitimate concerns that they bring.\n  Let me just say this. I would not mind putting this in the bill if I \ncould at this point, but I cannot and still have a bill. We have a bill \nthat has alien terrorist removal provisions. It would help this country \nall over the world. It would help other countries all over the world. \nDesignation of terrorist organizations, we start to put a stop to \nterrorist organizations. It would certainly stop the fundraising. We \nhave language that will stop the raising of funds in the United States \nof America that are sponsoring terrorism all over this world.\n  These are big provisions. These are things that can make a \ndifference. We can get around these other technicalities, and we can \nget wiretaps if we need them. But we cannot get these things without \nthis bill.\n  Summary exclusion of alien terrorists, we have a right to do it \nbecause of this bill. These were provisions we had to fight to get back \ninto the bill that we had written in the Senate, provisions that will \nmake a difference, not some technicality that is important and I would \nlike to have in, that the Senator from Delaware would like to have in, \nand rightly so. I do not have any problem with that. We have not been \nable to get those technicalities in, but there are ways around those \ntechnicalities today without having them in. There are no ways around \nthese provisions, none. We cannot do these things without this bill. \nWithout this bill we could not stop many major terrorist problems in \nthis country that could happen in the future.\n  We have language in here on biological weaponry, something that is \ncritical. Every one of us is concerned about that, and rightly so. We \nsucceeded in getting the House to tighten up and toughen up those \nprovisions dealing with the transportation and sale of human biological \nagents. That needs to be done. We should not wait a day longer; we \nshould not wait an hour longer to get that done. We have criminal alien \nremoval procedures. When these criminal aliens get convicted, the \nminute their sentence is over, they are moved. We get them out of this \ncountry so they cannot just waltz out of the jail and go and start \ndoing further terrorist activities.\n\n  We have $1 billion in authorization money in this bill, to go to work \ntomorrow, if we pass this bill and as soon as the President signs it, \nto go to work to fight against this terrorist activity.\n  We have language in here that goes a long way toward tagging \nexplosives. I could go on and on. I could talk for 4 or 5 hours on what \nis in this bill and why it is going to make a difference against \nterrorism.\n  I have to say my colleague from Delaware deserves his reputation as a \nvery fine lawyer and somebody who is bringing up very good points here. \nMost of the language he has brought up, I wrote. Naturally, some of it \nI would like to have in the bill. But we can get around most of those \nproblems with current criminal law. We cannot get around these problems \nI am discussing with regard to terrorism.\n  Let me just say on wiretapping alone, just so people understand how \nserious this is, in 18 United States Code, section 2518, it says:\n\n       Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter, any \n     investigative or law enforcement officer, [any, by the way] \n     specially designated by the Attorney General, the Deputy \n     Attorney General, the Associate Attorney General or by the \n     principal prosecuting attorney of any State or subdivision\n\n[[Page S3457]]\n\n     thereof acting pursuant to a statute of that State, who \n     reasonably determines that--\n       (a) an emergency situation exists that involves--\n       (i) immediate danger of death or serious physical injury to \n     any person,\n       (ii) conspiratorial activities threatening the national \n     security interest, or\n       (iii) conspiratorial activities characteristic of organized \n     crime,\n       that requires a wire, oral, or electronic communication to \n     be intercepted before an order authorizing such interception \n     can, with due diligence, be obtained. . . .\n\n  I would like all this clarifying language in. I would not mind having \nit. We had it in the Senate bill and we have worked for a year to try \nto get it back in and almost every major, big provision we have gotten \nback in. Some of this we have not. But we have ways to get around those \nproblems.\n  I will repeat it. Talking in real terms, realistically, there is \nalways a way to do it if it has to be done, to get a wiretap. But there \nis not always a way to remove terrorist aliens. There is not a way \nright now to designate terrorist organizations as terrorists and to \nstart branding them for what they are all over the world and start \nusing the force of American power and law against them. There is no \nreal way to stop fundraising today for terrorist organizations in this \ncountry.\n\n  I might say there is no summary exclusion of alien terrorists today. \nWe do not have any aspects against biological weapons.\n  I was the one who held the hearing just a month or so ago, showing \nwhere you could get--anybody if they were clever enough, could get \nhuman pathogens that could cause major diseases all over this country.\n  I might add, we do not have any current criminal alien removal \nprocedures. This bill grants all of that.\n  We do not have habeas corpus reform, death penalty reform in this \ncountry. That alone, the people who have suffered, the victims of the \nOklahoma City bombing would be enough to justify this bill. But I am \ngiving you big-time stuff that will make a difference against \nterrorism. These other matters, we can get around those in most \ninstances.\n  I am telling you, I will just say one other thing. I am committing \nright here on the floor today I will do everything in my power, as \nchairman of the Judiciary Committee and as one of 100 Senators here, to \ntry to correct some of these matters in the future, after we have these \nstudies that help us to know how to correct them and after we can get \nrid of some of these perceptions that law enforcement is too intrusive \nand is not protective of the civil rights and liberties of people in \nthis country.\n  I believe it is. I believe our law enforcement people are the best in \nthe world. We have occasional mistakes, but I think the FBI is the best \nin the world. I think our Justice Department is the best in the world. \nI think ATF does a very good job and they are cleaning up a lot of \nproblems that have existed in the past in the eyes of most people who \nown guns in this country, and they are doing it, I think, in an \nexpeditious and good way. I am proud of the law enforcement in this \ncountry. I want to give them the tools and I want to work hard to make \nsure we have them. But we have to give them these tools now. We have to \nstart fighting terrorism, instead of really babbling, here, on the \nfloor of the U.S. Senate.\n  The longer we go the more difficult it is to get this through over in \nthe House. If we change one word of this and go back to conference, I \ncan tell you right now we are in danger of losing the bill. So, sure I \ncan improve any bill. Just make me a dictator and let me write whatever \nI want to and I guarantee you it will be perfect. At least that is the \nidea of some people in this body. But we have to live in the real world \nof bringing 100 Senators, 435 Representatives--535 minds together and, \nby gosh, we have done a pretty good job.\n\n  When the Senator read the Internet bomb description, had his idea--\nand I might add even I would agree with the idea--been the law, he \nmight have been in violation of his own law. The fact of the matter is, \nthere are still ways of getting around that problem. We can go after \nbomb makers, under this bill. We can make a difference.\n  I just wanted to mention a few things that we are really fighting for \nhere, major issues, major issues that can help us against crime, \nagainst terrorism, that will help to prevent future terrorist \nactivities. Do we have everything in this bill? I said from the \nbeginning, no, we do not, because we have to bring together at least \nhalf of the 535 people serving in both Houses of Congress. But we have \na lot of things in this bill I never thought we would get there, \nthrough 535 people. This is a bipartisan bill. It is a bill that both \nRepublicans and Democrats have fashioned. Frankly, I am proud of it and \nI would like to get about passing it.\n  In that regard, then, on behalf of Senator Dole and myself, I move to \ntable the Senator's motion and I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Kempthorne). Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, may I make a suggestion? There are several \ncolleagues who apparently will have difficulty getting here in the next \n5 minutes for this vote. Senator Kennedy is on the floor, ready to \nproceed with an amendment. Maybe we could just stack the two? I have \nbeen opposing stacking them all day.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent we stack the next \ntwo votes to occur immediately after the time expires on Senator \nKennedy's amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I yield myself 60 seconds on the bill. I \nhave two responses.\n  My distinguished and able colleague has mixed up apples and oranges \nhere. The section he read from the wiretap statute related to emergency \nwiretaps that do not require a court order at the front end.\n\n  What we are talking about are wiretaps where they want to go in and \nwe want to prove they have probable cause to get the wiretap in the \nfirst case.\n  Second, I agree with everything that he says about the good parts of \nthe bill. They were in the same bill I introduced, most of those \nthings. I am for them. But the problem is, he mentioned there are 1,500 \nterrorists out there, or whatever the number. Under the bill now we \ncreate a new crime relating to providing material support for \nterrorists, if you send money to Hamas and provide material support or \nan automobile or a train ticket or whatever it is, and it is not a \ncrime. It is a Federal crime now, but one for which you cannot get a \nwiretap. That seems to make no sense to me and that is why I have \nintroduced this amendment.\n  I yield the floor to my friend from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, if my friend from Massachusetts will just \nallow me to respond for 15 seconds, I will just make the statement \nagain. Realistically, in this real world, if law enforcement wants to \nget a wiretap, whether emergency or otherwise, it is going to be able \nto get it. That has been my experience and I think it has been the \nexperience of every prosecutor, I think, in this country.\n  Mr. BIDEN. I yield myself 15 more seconds on the bill. That is the \nvery thing we do not want to happen. We want prosecutors to operate \nunder the law. We do not want to further ignite the imagination of \nthose folks over in the House. We want them to do it by the numbers, \nnot with imagination.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I would just add, they will do it by the \nlaw, but realistically they can do it. I have also said that I will \nwork with the distinguished Senator from Delaware to try to resolve \nthese problems in a formal bill in the future, as we examine this more \ncarefully. I think we can do that job. But it is misleading, to think \nthe American people are not going to be protected, from a wiretap \nstandpoint, when I know the law enforcement officials can use wiretaps \nand can get them, realistically, in almost every situation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I may speak \non the conference report without the time being charged to the \nremaining 20 minutes of the general debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n\n[[Page S3458]]\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, it is a year since the tragic bombing of \nthe Federal building in Oklahoma City, and 10 months since the Senate \npassed a bill to give Federal law enforcement agencies the effective \nassistance they need to deal with these crimes.\n  Unfortunately, the conference report before us is a far weaker bill \nthan the measure we passed last year. All that is left now is the \nhollow shell of a terrorism bill, a mockery of the strong bipartisan \nlegislation passed by the Senate. Most of the meaningful antiterrorism \nmeasures passed by the Senate have been stripped out by the House, so \nthat this bill is far less likely to deter terrorist crimes or aid in \nthe apprehension of terrorists.\n  Using the phony label of antiterrorism, the bill achieves two \nreprehensible goals: it denies meaningful habeas corpus review to State \ndeath row inmates, and it makes it easier to turn away refugees and \nvictims of political persecution from America's shores.\n  Everyone knows what happened to this bill. It fell victim to the \nanti-Government assault of the National Rifle Association. After the \nSenate passed a tough, effective terrorism bill, the NRA stepped in and \nprevented House action for months. Then the NRA's supporters in the \nHouse stripped the bill of key provisions to strengthen Federal law \nenforcement.\n  As a result of the NRA's maneuvering, the conference report before us \nis completely inadequate to meet the needs of law enforcement. The \nSenate still has a chance to insist on a real terrorism bill, and not a \nsham bill. We should send this bill back to conference, and insist that \nthe conferees restore the tough Senate provisions.\n  There are numerous glaring gaps in the conference report:\n  It does not include the expanded wiretapping authority that the FBI \nhas said is necessary to keep up with current telecommunications \ntechnology.\n  It does not address the dangerous reality that bomb-making \ninformation is now freely disseminated on the Internet.\n  It does not include a Senate-passed provision extending the statute \nof limitations for serious firearms offenses.\n  It does not include a necessary exception to the posse comitatus laws \nso that military experts can provide technical assistance to law \nenforcement in terrorist attacks involving chemical or biological \nwarfare.\n  Each of these measures was included in the Senate bill, but has been \nstripped out of the conference report at the insistence of the NRA.\n  And while the bill is clearly deficient in these respects, it \nincludes other provisions that are too extreme in limiting the rights \nand liberties of individuals:\n  It eviscerates the ancient Writ of Habeas Corpus, denying death row \ninmates the opportunity to obtain even one meaningful Federal review of \nthe constitutionality of their convictions.\n  It returns to the discredited cold war guilt-by-association policy of \nthe McCarran-Walter law, excluding individuals from our shores based on \nmere membership in an organization. Current law already contains \nauthority to exclude members of known terrorist organizations. The far \nbroader sweep of this bill is unnecessary and excessive.\n  It places excessive restrictions on the ability of refugees to obtain \nasylum in the United States. This provision was never considered by the \nfull Senate, and it ought to be debated on the immigration bill, not \nthe terrorism legislation.\n  Mr. President, I point out here what has been happening. Asylum \nclaims decline 57 percent as productivity doubles in 1995. What we have \nseen is the dramatic reduction in terms of the asylum claims. In 1994, \nthere were 122,000; 60,000 completed.\n  In 1995, 53,000; 126,000 were completed. The Justice Department has a \nhandle on this issue. It is doing it in a conscientious, fair, and \ndisciplined way, and we ought to retain it and not be caught up with \nother facts and figures.\n  Every omnibus bill requires Members of Congress to weigh the good \nprovisions against the bad ones. I voted for the Senate bill even \nthough it included the objectionable limits on habeas corpus. But the \nbalance has changed, now that the Senate bill has been seriously \nweakened. There is too little to place on the scale against the \nshameful trashing of the writ of habeas corpus and the Nation's asylum \nsystem.\n  It is unfortunate that the unrelated and controversial subject of \nhabeas corpus was injected into this bill in the first place. \nProponents say that habeas corpus is relevant because the suspects in \nthe Oklahoma City bombing are charged with a Federal capital offense. \nBut that fact is no justification for changing the rules with regard to \nState prisoners.\n  The habeas corpus proposals do not strike a fair balance. The bill \ndenies death row inmates a full opportunity to raise claims of \ninnocence based on newly discovered evidence. It will therefore \nincrease the likelihood that innocent people will be executed. The \nproposal to limit inmates to one bite at the apple is sound in \nprinciple. But surely the interest in swift executions must yield to \nnew evidence that an innocent person is about to be put to death. As \nSupreme Court Justice Potter Stewart once wrote, ``Swift justice \ndemands more than just swiftness.''\n  Also, the proposal would unwisely require Federal courts to defer to \nState courts on issues of Federal constitutional law. A Federal court \ncould not grant a writ habeas corpus based on Federal constitutional \nclaims, unless the State court's judgment was ``an unreasonable \napplication of Federal law.''\n  It is a serious mistake to require a Federal court to defer to the \njudgment of a State court on matters of Federal constitutional law. The \nnotion that a Federal court should be prevented from correcting a \nconstitutional error because it was a reasonable error is unacceptable, \nespecially in a capital case. Ever since the days of Chief Justice John \nMarshall, the Federal courts have served as the great defenders of \nconstitutional protections, and they should remain so.\n  The asylum provisions in this bill are equally misguided.\n  The Senate-passed bill did not address this subject, because it is \nmore appropriately dealt with as part of immigration reform. But the \nconferees adopted House-passed language that drastically limits the \nability of refugees to claim asylum if they arrive without proper \ndocuments. This provision undermines the fundamental treaty obligations \nof the United States by subjecting legitimate refugees to persecution \nand even torture.\n  It is often impossible for asylum seekers fleeing persecution to \nobtain a valid passport or travel document before they leave. Even the \neffort to obtain a travel document from the same government that is the \npersecutor may result in further danger to the asylum seeker. People \nmay die or may be tortured while waiting for the proper papers. \nAccepting this reality, the U.N. High Commission on Refugees has \nrecognized that circumstances may compel a refugee to use fraudulent \ndocuments to escape persecution.\n  This fact has long been recognized under international law. The \nUnited States has international obligations to protect refugees and \nasylum seekers who use fraudulent documents to escape persecution \nabroad. Article 31 of the U.N. Convention Relating to the Status of \nRefugees imposes an obligation on the United States not to penalize \nrefugees and asylum seekers who are fleeing persecution, and who \npresent fraudulent documents or no documents at all.\n  Under current practice, when asylum seekers arrive in the United \nStates without valid travel documents or a passport, they are placed in \ndetention. Generally, they are released from detention only if an \nasylum prescreening officer believes they have a sound case. That is \nthe dramatic change in the way the Justice Department is considering \nthe asylum seekers at the present time and how they were considered a \nnumber of months ago. Otherwise, they must pursue their asylum claim \nwhile in detention.\n  The pending bill significantly changes this process. It gives the \nprescreening officer the authority to deport an asylum seeker who \nenters with false or no documents. The office can deport the asylum \nseeker without a full hearing. An immigration judge never sees the \ncase. In addition, the asylum seeker has no access to the assistance of \ncounsel or even an interpreter.\n  As we consider this unprecedented proposal, we should remind \nourselves of Raoul Wallenberg, the hero who saved countless lives \nduring the Holocaust by\n\n[[Page S3459]]\n\nissuing false travel documents so that Jews could escape Hitler's \npersecution. If this bill had been law in 1946, those Jews could have \nbeen returned to Europe without so much as a hearing.\n  Finally, the bill is flawed because it excludes foreigners from our \nshores based on mere membership in a disfavored organization.\n  In the days of the cold war, distinguished writers, professors, and \nothers were excluded from the United States based on their mere \nmembership in a Communist organization. Finally in 1990, we repealed \nthe notorious McCarran-Walter law and set exclusion criteria based on \nindividual actions, not their words.\n  This bill is a giant step backward. It explicitly sets excessive \nexclusion criteria based on membership in an organization, even though \nit would be grossly unfair to assume that all or even most members of \nthe organization are terrorists.\n  Current law already gives broad authority to exclude members of \nterrorist organizations in such cases, and the blunderbuss provision in \nthis bill is unneeded. If applied to American citizens, it would be a \nviolation of the first amendment.\n  The harm caused by the habeas corpus, asylum, and exclusion \nprovisions of this bill is severe, and the good accomplished by the \nantiterrorism sections of the bill is minor. I urge the Senate to send \nthis defective bill back to conference with instructions to do the job \nright--and produce a real antiterrorism bill that gives law enforcement \nthe tools it needs to get the job done.\n  I thank the chairman and the ranking minority member of the committee \nfor letting me address the Senate on this issue.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I have listened to my distinguished \ncolleague and friend, and he would like to restore the Senate bill. We \njust cannot do that. I was very proud of that Senate bill. I wrote most \nof it and, frankly, I think our colleagues worked together to come up \nwith a good bill. When it went to the House, the House enacted a bill \nwhich really was much less than the Senate bill. We have gone to \nconference and have brought most all of the Senate bill back.\n  The distinguished Senator from Massachusetts says that this bill we \nhave today is a hollow shell. Now, come on. Let me just go through some \nhighlights of this bill.\n  We have most everything back, and the things we do not have back, we \ncan probably, in the real world, solve anyway, under current existing \nlaw. I have to say, yes, I would prefer the original Senate bill, but \nlet me give you one illustration.\n  In the fundraising provisions, I might add that the Antidefamation \nLeague, and others of similar mind--and I am of similar mind--believe \nthat our fundraising language is far superior in this bill than it was \nin the Senate bill. I know it is far superior.\n\n  We were able to work that out with our colleagues in the House. That \nalone is a reason for preferring this bill over the Senate bill, plus \nthe added promise that I have made here that I will try to work out \nthese wiretap and other issues, or at least the wiretap issues, in the \nSenate Judiciary Committee.\n  But just look at the highlights of this antiterrorism bill. Capital \npunishment reform, death penalty reform, something that has been needed \nfor years, decades. It is being abused all over the country. There are \nbetter than 3,000 people who have been living on death row for years \nwith the sentences never carried out, the victims going through the \npain every time they turn around. This will solve that problem while \nstill protecting their constitutional rights and every right of appeal \nthat they really should have. It is written well.\n  The international terrorism prohibitions, prohibitions on \ninternational terrorist fundraising. As I have said, the Anti-\nDefamation League, AIPAC, and a whole raft of others that are concerned \nin this area, like the language in this bill much better than the \nlanguage in the Senate bill.\n  This subtitle adds to Federal law prohibitions which provide material \nsupport to, or raise funds for, foreign organizations designated by the \nSecretary of State, in consultation with the Secretary of the Treasury \nand the Attorney General, to be terrorist organizations.\n  We have the Terrorist and Criminal Alien Removal and Exclusion Act in \nthis bill. We remove alien terrorists, and we provide very good \nlanguage that was very much the same as the Senate language.\n  We have the exclusion of members or representatives of terrorist \norganizations, the alien terrorists exclusion, if you will. This \npermits, as a new legal basis for alien exclusion, the denial of entry \ninto the United States of any person who is a representative or member \nof a designated terrorist organization.\n  We have a whole title on nuclear, biological, and chemical weapons \nrestrictions. These are not picayune provisions. This is big-time \nstuff. This is something this country has needed for years and the \nwhole world needs. We have it in this bill.\n  We have the expansion of scope and jurisdictional bases of nuclear \nmaterials prohibitions and a report to Congress on thefts of explosive \nmaterials from armories. We require the Attorney General, together with \nthe Secretary of Defense, to undertake a study of the number of thefts \nof firearms, explosives, and other terrorist-type materials from \nmilitary arsenals. We will make them get on these things.\n  We have biological weapons restrictions, enhanced penalties, and \ncontrol of biological agents. We have chemical weapons restrictions, \nchemical weapons, and biological weapons of mass destruction. We \nprovide for a study of the facility for training and the evaluation of \npersonnel who respond to the use of chemical or biological weapons in \nurban or suburban areas.\n  We have the implementation of the Plastic Explosives Convention in \nhere. We have the marking of plastic explosives. We have studies on the \nmarking of other explosives and putting taggants on them.\n  We have made a whole bunch of modifications in criminal law to \ncounterterrorism, increased penalties for conspiracies involving \nexplosives. All this talk about explosives. We provide language in here \nthat will help to solve those problems.\n  Acts of terrorism transcending national boundaries, we have language \non that. We have criminal procedure changes in here that would make a \nreal difference with regard to certain terrorism offenses overseas, the \nclarification of maritime violence jurisdiction, increased and \nalternate conspiracy penalties for terrorism offenses, clarification of \nFederal jurisdiction over bomb threats. The expansion and modification \nof weapons of mass destruction statute is in here, the addition of \nterrorism offenses to the money laundering statute.\n  We have the protection of Federal employees in here mainly because it \nis needed now in this day and age with some of the vicious people we \nhave to put up with in our society. We have the protection of current \nand former officials in here, officers, employees of the United States.\n\n  We have the death penalty as an aggravating factor. We solve that and \nadd multiple killings to the list of aggravating factors in the \nimposition of the death penalty. We have detention hearing language in \nhere and directions to the sentencing commission.\n  I have to say, we have a whole raft of other things that I do not \nhave time to mention. Look, it is time to pass this terrorism bill. It \nis time to let the people in Oklahoma City know we mean business here.\n  Is the time expired on both sides? On behalf of the majority leader \nand I, I move that we table the Kennedy amendment and ask for the yeas \nand nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The yeas and nays have been ordered. The \nquestion occurs on agreeing to the motion to table.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, do we have motions to table on both of \nthese amendments? And will they be back to back?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is only one amendment. The Senator from \nMassachusetts did not offer an amendment.\n  Mr. HATCH. He did not. I am happy to then proceed with the vote on \nthe Biden amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question occurs on agreeing to the motion \nto table the motion to recommit.\n\n[[Page S3460]]\n\n The yeas and nays have been ordered.

Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. DOLE. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I rise to commend Senator Hatch and the \nother members of the conference committee for incorporating what \noriginated in this Congress as my bill, S. 270, the Alien Terrorist \nRemoval Act of 1995, into the conference report on S. 735, the Anti-\nTerrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996.\n  I also want to thank Senator Specter again for the opportunity to \ntestify before his Judiciary Subcommittee on Terrorism last summer \nregarding my alien terrorist removal bill.\n  My bill--now the alien terrorist removal section of the conference \nreport on S. 735--essentially embodies the Smith-Simpson amendment that \nthe Senate passed unanimously as part of the crime bill in the last \nCongress. Unfortunately, certain House members of the conference \ncommittee on the 1994 crime bill insisted on the deletion of the Smith-\nSimpson amendment from that legislation.\n  After I introduced S. 270 early in the first session of this \nCongress, the Clinton administration proposed its own substantially \nidentical version of my bill as part of its omnibus antiterrorism \nlegislation. Then, in the wake of the Oklahoma City bombing, Senators \nDole and Hatch introduced S. 735, which incorporated the substance of \nmy bill, S. 270. S. 735, of course, passed the Senate by a vote of 91 \nto 8 last June.\n  Unfortunately, when S. 735 reached the House, the alien terrorist \nremoval provisions of the Senate-passed bill were removed from the \nlegislation. Commendably, however, Senator Hatch steadfastly insisted \nthat the conference committee include an alien terrorist removal \nsection in its conference report on S. 735. Fortunately for our Nation, \nSenator Hatch succeeded in that effort.\n  Let me summarize briefly for the benefit of my colleagues what the \nalien terrorist removal section of S. 735 is all about. The alien \nterrorist removal provisions of the bill would establish a new, \nspecial, judicial procedure under which classified information can be \nused to establish the deportability of alien terrorists.\n  The new procedures that are established under section 401 of S. 735 \nare carefully designed to safeguard vitally important national security \ninterests, while at the same time according appropriate protection to \nthe necessarily limited due process rights of aliens.\n  Under current law, Mr. President, classified information cannot be \nused to establish the deportability of terrorist aliens. Thus, when \nthere is insufficient unclassified information available to establish \nthe deportability of a terrorist alien, the Government faces two \nequally unacceptable choices.\n\n  First, the Justice Department could declassify enough of its evidence \nagainst the alien in question to establish his deportability. \nSometimes, however, that simply cannot be done because the classified \ninformation in question is so sensitive that its disclosure would \nendanger the lives of human sources or compromise highly sensitive \nmethods of intelligence gathering.\n  The Government's second, and equally untenable, choice would be \nsimply to let the terrorist alien involved remain in the United States.\n  Sadly, Mr. President, what I have just described is not a \nhypothetical situation. It happens in real cases. That is why the \nDepartment of Justice, under both Republican and Democratic Presidents \nand Attorneys General, has been asking for the authority granted by my \nbill--now section 401 of S. 735--since 1988.\n  Utilizing the existing definitions of terrorism in the Immigration \nAct of 1990 and of classified information in the Classified Information \nProcedures Act, section 401 of S. 735 would establish a special alien \nterrorist removal court comprised of sitting U.S. district judges \ndesignated by the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of the United \nStates. This new alien removal court is modeled on the special court \nthat was created by the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act.\n  Under section 401 of S. 735, the U.S. district judge sitting as the \nspecial court would personally review the classified information \ninvolved in camera and ex parte.\n  Where possible, without compromising the classified information \ninvolved, the alien in question would be provided with an unclassified \nsummary of the classified information in order to assist him in \npreparing a defense.\n  Ultimately, the special court would determine whether, considering \nthe record as a whole, the Justice Department has proven, by a \npreponderance of the evidence, that the alien is a terrorist who should \nbe removed from the United States.\n  Finally, Mr. President, any alien who is ordered removed under the \nprovisions of section 401 of S. 735 would have the right to appeal to \nthe U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit.\n  Mr. President, the most serious national security threat that our \nNation faces in the post-cold-war world is the scourge of international \nterrorism. That threat became reality in 1993 with the terrorist attack \non the World Trade Center in New York City. Tragically, with the \nOklahoma City bombing 1 year ago this week, we learned the bitter \nlesson that we face the threat of terrorism from domestic extremists as \nwell.\n  Now, this historic 104th Congress is responding, strongly and \neffectively, to address the twin terrorist threats that we face. I urge \nthe prompt adoption of the conference report on S. 735 by the Senate \nand, once again, I commend the conferees for incorporating my alien \nterrorist removal bill into their landmark legislation.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am encouraged that the conference report \nincludes important provisions that I proposed back in June 1995, when \nthe Senate began consideration of antiterrorism legislation. These \nprovisions were adopted by the Senate and then passed as part of the \noriginal S.735 and passed a second time last year by the Senate as part \nof H.R. 665, our version of the mandatory victim restitution \nlegislation. They are now included as sections 231 and 232 of the \nconference report. It is astonishing that at the time I added these \nprovisions to the bill there were no victims-related measures in any \nantiterrorism legislation.\n  When the bomb exploded outside the Murrah Federal Building in \nOklahoma City last year, my thoughts and prayers, and I suspect that \nthose of all Americans, turned immediately to the victims of this \nhorrendous act. It is my hope that through this legislation we will \nproceed to enact a series of improvements in our growing body of law \nrecognizing the rights and needs of victims of crime. We can do more to \nsee\n\n[[Page S3461]]\n\nthat victims of crime, including terrorism, are treated with dignity \nand assisted.\n  The conference report incorporates the provisions of the Justice for \nVictims of Terrorism Act, which will accomplish a number of worthwhile \nobjectives. They include a proposal to increase the availability of \nassistance to victims of terrorism and mass violence here at home.\n  We, in this country, have been shielded from much of the terrorism \nperpetrated abroad. That sense of security has been shaken recently by \nthe bombing in Oklahoma City, the destruction at the World Trade Center \nin New York, and assaults upon the White House. I, therefore, proposed \nthat we allow additional flexibility in targeting resources to victims \nof terrorism and mass violence and the trauma and devastation that they \ncause.\n  The conference report includes these provisions to make funds \navailable through supplemental grants to the States to assist and \ncompensate our neighbors who are victims of terrorism and mass \nviolence, which incidents might otherwise overwhelm the resources of a \nState's crime victims compensation program or its victims assistance \nservices. I understand that assistance efforts to aid those who were \nthe victims of the Oklahoma City bombing are now $1 million in debt. \nThese provisions should help.\n  The substitute will also fill a gap in our law for residents of the \nUnited States who are victims of terrorism and mass violence that occur \noutside the borders of the United States. Those who are not in the \nmilitary, civil service, or civilians in the service of the United \nStates are not eligible for benefits in accordance with the Omnibus \nDiplomatic Security and Antiterrorism Act of 1986. One of the \ncontinuing tragedies of the downing of Pan Am flight 103 over \nLockerbie, Scotland, is that the United States Government had no \nauthority to provide assistance or compensation to the victims of that \nheinous crime. Likewise, the U.S. victims of the Achille Lauro incident \ncould not be given aid. This was wrong and should be remedied.\n  In its report to Congress in 1994, the Office for Victims of Crime at \nthe U.S. Department of Justice identified the problem. Both the ABA and \nthe State Department have commented on their concern and their desire \nthat crime victims compensation benefits be provided to U.S. citizens \nvictimized in other countries. This bill takes an important step in \nthat direction. Certainly U.S. victims of terrorism overseas are \ndeserving of our support and assistance.\n  In addition, I believe that we must allow a greater measure of \nflexibility to our State and local victims' assistance programs and \nsome greater certainty so that they can know that our commitment to \nvictims programming will not wax and wane with events. Accordingly, the \nconference report includes an important provision to increase the base \namounts for States' victims assistance grants to $500,000 and allows \nvictims assistance grants to be made for a 3-year cycle of programming, \nrather than the year of award plus one, which is the limit contained in \ncurrent law. This programming change reflects the recommendation of the \nOffice for Victims of Crime contained in its June 1994 report to \nCongress.\n  I am disappointed that some have objected to an important improvement \nthat would have allowed all unspent grant funds to be returned to the \ncrime victims fund from which they came and reallocated to crime \nvictims assistance programs. I believe that we ought to treat the crime \nvictims fund, the violent crime reduction trust fund, and Violence \nAgainst Women Act funds with respect and use them for the important \npurposes for which they were created.\n  The crime victims fund, we should remember, is not a matter of \nappropriation and is not funded through tax dollars. Rather, it is \nfunded exclusively through the assessments against those convicted of \nFederal crimes. The crime victims fund is a mechanism to direct use of \nthose funds to compensate and assist crime victims. That is the express \npurpose and justification for the assessments.\n  Accordingly, I believe it is appropriate for those funds to be used \nfor crime victims and, when not expended for purposes of a crime \nvictims program, they ought to be returned to the crime victims fund \nfor reobligation. Instead, because of a technicality in the application \nof the Budget Act, the conference report includes a change from the \nlanguage that I proposed and that was approved by the Judiciary \nCommittee and previously by the Senate. My language would have returned \nall unspent crime victims grant funds to the crime victims fund. The \nconference report will require that some of the money that came from \nthe crime victims fund go, instead, to the general Treasury if it \nremains unobligated more than 2 years after the year of grant award. I \nam pleased that we have been able to obtain some concession in this \nregard and note that the unobligated funds must exceed $500,000 in \norder to revert to the general Treasury.\n  Fortunately, the Office for Victims of Crime has improved its \nadministration of crime victims funds and that of the States over the \npast 3 years to a great extent. While more than $1 million a year has \nin past years remained unobligated from grants made through the States \nacross the country, in 1994 that number was reduced below $125,000. The \nDirector of the Office for Victims of Crime, Aileen Adams, should be \ncommended for this improvement. It is my hope that the administration \nof crime victims fund grants will continue to improve through the \nDepartment of Justice and the States and that the Department of Health \nand Human Services will, likewise, improve its oversight and grant \nadministration and encourage the States to be more vigilant. If so, the \nchange in the language of the bill from that previously adopted by the \nSenate and by the Judiciary Committee will not result in a significant \ndiversion of crime victims fund money to other uses.\n  I also regret that the emergency reserve is not structured as I \nrecommended. I would limit the reserve to the highest level of annual \ndeposits placed in the fund in the past 5 fiscal years. This would \nallow the emergency reserve to fulfill its purpose as a rainy day fund \nand smooth the distribution of aberrational deposit pattern. Further, I \nhope that we will soon reconsider the 40-percent cap of Federal \ncontributions to State victim compensation awards and other suggested \nimprovements to the Victims of Crime Act.\n  Our State and local communities and community-based nonprofits cannot \nbe kept on a string like a yo-yo if they are to plan and implement \nvictims assistance and compensation programs. They need to be able to \nplan and have a sense of stability if these measures are to achieve \ntheir fullest potential.\n  I know, for instance, that in Vermont Lori Hayes at the Vermont \nCenter for crime victims Services, Judy Rex at the Vermont Network \nAgainst Domestic Violence and Sexual Abuse, and many others provide \ntremendous service under difficult conditions. I was delighted to be \nable to arrange a meeting between them and the Attorney General of the \nUnited States when Attorney General Reno recently visited Vermont. They \nwill be able to put increased annual assistance grants to good use. \nSuch dedicated individuals and organizations will also be aided by \nincreasing their programming cycle by even 1 year. Three years has been \na standard that has worked well in other programming settings. Crime \nvictims' programming deserves no less security.\n  In 1984, when we established the crime victims fund to provide \nFederal assistance to State and local victims' compensation and \nassistance efforts, we funded it with fines and penalties from those \nconvicted of Federal crime. The level of required contribution was set \nlow. Twelve years have passed and it is time to raise that level of \nassessment in order to fund the needs of crime victims. Accordingly, \nthe conference report includes as section 210 a provision that I worked \non with Senator McCain and that the Senate previously passed as an \namendment to the antiterrorism bill last summer. It doubles the special \nassessments levied under the Victims of Crime Act against those \nconvicted of Federal felonies in order to assist all victims of crime.\n  I do not think that $100 to assist crime victims is too much for \nthose individuals convicted of a Federal felony to contribute to help \ncrime victims. I do not think that $400 is too much to\n\n[[Page S3462]]\n\ninsist that corporations convicted of a Federal felony contribute. \nAccordingly, the conference report would raise these to be the minimum \nlevel of assessment against those convicted of crime.\n  While we have made progress over the last 15 years in recognizing \ncrime victims' rights and providing much-needed assistance, we still \nhave more to do. I am proud to have played a role in passage of the \nVictims and Witness Protection Act of 1982, the Victims of Crime Act of \n1984, the Victims' Rights and Restitution Act of 1990, and the victims \nprovisions included in such measures as the Violent Crime Control and \nLaw Enforcement Act of 1994. I thank my colleagues for their acceptance \nof the provisions of the Justice for Victims of Terrorism Act.\n  I thank the outstanding crime victims advocates from Vermont for \ntheir help, advice, and support in connection with the Justice for \nVictims of Terrorism Act and the improvements it includes to the \nVictims of Crime Act. I also thank them for the work they are doing by \ndeveloping and implementing programs for crime victims in Vermont.\n  In addition, I thank the National Organization for Victim Assistance, \nthe National Association of Crime Victim Compensation Boards, and the \nNational Victim Center for their assistance and support in the \ndevelopment of the Justice for Victims of Terrorism Act. Without their \nhelp, we could not make the important progress that its provisions \ncontain. I appreciate the cooperation of all those who have worked to \nincorporate these improvements to the Victims of Crime Act in this \nmeasure.\n  It is important to me that we do all we can to bring stability to the \ncrime victims fund so that the State programs for compensating and \nassisting victims of crime can plan and provide services for victims \nthat increase and expand across our States in the coming years. I hope \nthat we can continue to cooperate and refine the Victims of Crime Act's \nprovisions.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, it has been nearly 1 year since America \nwas shocked and outraged by the bombing in Oklahoma City.\n  The anguish and the pain caused by this cowardly act left a marked \nimpression on each of us which remains today.\n  That which had formerly been reserved for distant parts of the \nglobe--acts of savage terrorism--was now being visited upon the \ncitizens of this Nation.\n  There can be no debate that we must respond to these acts, as we must \nall acts of crime, with the singular and unyielding purpose of \ncapturing, prosecuting and punishing the responsible individuals.\n  Unfortunately, in the 12 months that has passed since Oklahoma City, \nthis legislation has been subject to many varied interests--interests \nplacing certain proposals above the underlying goal of responding to \nterrorism in the measured and focused manner necessary to protect the \ncitizens of this Nation.\n  Unfortunately, many of the proposals which have been offered \nthroughout this debate to combat terrorism simply went too far and \nplaced the civil liberties of all Americans in peril.\n  For this simple reason I opposed language included in the Senate bill \nwhich would have expanded the scope of wiretap authority and would have \ninjected the military into areas of law enforcement which are better \nleft to local officials.\n  I am concerned that these provisions move us toward unwarranted \nexpansion of Federal power. Accordingly, I support the removal of these \nprovisions from the final package.\n  However, just as some of those proposals overstepped the boundaries \nof civil liberties, the final conference report remains flawed.\n  Careful review of this legislation reveals that it contains very few \nsubstantive provisions which would have prevented or helped prevent the \nOklahoma City tragedy.\n  As I said when the Senate considered this legislation last summer, it \nis essential that law enforcement be given the resources and support \nnecessary to investigate and prosecute terrorists.\n  To truly protect citizens of this Nation, terrorists must be stopped \nbefore they strike--before they take innocent lives in some misguided \neffort to prove the validity of their agenda.\n  That is why I am so troubled when I hear the suggestion that the \nsingle most effective antiterrorism provision in this bill is the \nalleged reform of habeas corpus.\n  The link between habeas corpus and keeping the people of this Nation \nfree from acts of terrorism is tenuous at best. The argument that these \nhabeas provisions will prevent another Oklahoma City is one which is \nmanufactured solely to justify inclusion of these unrelated provisions \nin a bill originally meant to address terrorism.\n  These so-called habeas reforms will do nothing to rid our communities \nof dangerous persons who may strike against innocent people.\n  The only time habeas corpus is even remotely related to terrorism is \nafter the terrorist has committed an act of terrorism, has been \napprehended, convicted and is sitting in a prison cell.\n  Once again political expediency has obscured sound policy making. In \nthe words of the New York Times, ``Members of Congress are exploiting \npublic concerns about terrorism to threaten basic civil liberties.''\n  Many of my colleagues want very sincerely to address what they \nperceive to be abuses in the use of habeas corpus. These efforts, \nhowever, should not be hidden behind the unsustainable claim that doing \nso in anyway makes the people of this Nation less likely to be attacked \nby terrorists.\n  Further, the provisions in the conference report go well beyond \nreform and eviscerate the constitutional underpinnings of habeas \ncorpus. Just as many of the law enforcement provisions went too far, so \ntoo do the habeas provisions.\n  By setting unreasonable limitations and standards of review available \non appeal of constitutional violations, this bill greatly enhances the \npotential that this Nation will execute an innocent person for a crime \nthey did not commit.\n  I do not disagree with my colleagues who argue that justice must be \nserved. The families of the victims and the American people deserve as \nmuch. However, the pursuit of justice does not require us, as these \nhabeas provisions do, to depart from over 200 years of constitutional \nprotections.\n  Justice is not served by the execution of an innocent human being. \nThe families of the victims and the American public will find no \ncomfort from such an occurrence.\n  Like so many facets of this bill, the habeas provisions of this bill \nlack any semblance of reasonable balance.\n  A recent March 20 editorial from the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel \nentitled ``A needless overreaction to terrorism'' criticized these \nprovisions and pointed out the fallacy of the alleged link between \nhabeas reform and terrorism or that these provisions will have any \ndeterrent effect.\n  In the words of the Journal;\n\n       It's difficult to see how limits on appeals by prison \n     inmates would deter terrorism. Most such prisoners have been \n     convicted of ordinary--not political--crimes. Besides, many \n     terrorists are willing to undergo punishment, even death, for \n     the causes they believe in.\n\n  The inclusion of habeas reform in this legislation has very little to \ndo with terrorism and a great deal to do with advancing an agenda which \nhas previously languished in the Congress.\n  Just as I opposed those law enforcement provisions which raised \nconstitutional concerns, so too do I oppose these proposals.\n  We should be just as wary of proposals which forsake constitutional \nprotection in the name of habeas reform as we are of those which do so \nin the name of expanding wiretap authority.\n  Mr. President, it is very likely that this conference report will \nbecome law. This is unfortunate. Not simply because bad provisions of \nthis bill will become bad law, but because this bill represents an \nopportunity squandered.\n  This legislation started as an effort to address terrorism--to \nprovide some protection for the citizens of this Nation against acts of \nterrorism. The American people deserve as much. Sadly Mr. President, \nfor all the fanfare which will likely accompany this legislation, it \nfails to meet that laudable and important goal.\n  Mr. HEFLIN. Mr. President, I will support passage of the Terrorism \nPrevention Act Conference Report. Although the conference report is not \nas\n\n[[Page S3463]]\n\nstrong as the Senate-passed bill, nor is it as strong as I would like, \nit is much stronger than the House-passed bill and reflects a \ncompromise between the two houses which is an essential element of our \nNation's democratic process.\n  It is fitting that we enact this legislation around the anniversary \nof the tragic bombing which occurred in Oklahoma City and resulted in \nsuch a massive loss of life and injury to innocent people. We must \nenhance our Nation's efforts to combat domestic and international \nterrorism, and the conference report is a step in the right direction.\n  I am pleased that the conferees were able to restore many provisions \nwhich the House-passed bill deleted, such as allowing courts to \nexpeditiously deport alien terrorists, allowing the President to \ndesignate foreign terrorist organizations so any assets they have in \nthe United States can be more easily frozen by the Government, and \nmaking it a crime to donate or accept funds for foreign terrorist \norganizations. Further, the House-passed bill contained almost no \nfunding for Federal law enforcement, and the conference report has a \nfunding level of $1 billion for Federal and State law enforcement over \na 4-year period.\n  The conference report contains a provision to require taggants be \nplaced on plastic explosives, which are most commonly used by foreign \nterrorists, thereby making them more detectable, and it calls for a \nstudy on placing taggants on other types of explosives.\n  I would have preferred that the conference report contained the \nSenate-passed provisions allowing for multipoint wiretaps and other \nstrong provisions, but this did not occur and motions to recommit the \nbill to conference with instructions to include those provisions have \nbeen unsuccessful. This is the democratic process, and I accept the \nwill of the Senate.\n  That does not, however, leave this legislation a toothless tiger. It \ncontains strong provisions to reform Federal habeas corpus laws--\nsomething that is long overdue. Reform of the habeas corpus process \nwill speed up the imposition of sentences of those criminal convicted \nof especially brutal crimes. Overall, the conference report is a step \nin the right direction, and I urge its passage so that it can be signed \nby the President and allow our Nation to enhance its efforts to combat \nboth domestic and international terrorism.\n  Mr. BRADLEY. Mr. President, I rise in support of the conference \nreport to S. 735, the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of \n1996. Almost 1 year ago today, the Oklahoma City bombing brought into \nsharp focus the reality and horror of domestic terrorism in America. \nThe death toll of the bombing stands at 167, making it the deadliest \nmass murder in the history of the United States.\n  While several strong crime fighting provisions that I supported in \nthe Senate version of the bill were deleted by the conference \ncommittee, this legislation contains tools that will enable the United \nStates to respond to the international and domestic terrorist threats \nand prosecute these despicable criminal acts. On balance, Mr. \nPresident, this legislation will enhance the ability of law enforcement \nto combat both foreign and domestic terrorism.\n  Mr. President, the provisions in this bill are vitally important to \nour efforts to respond to international and domestic threats of \nterrorism. I, therefore, support this bill, and I am confident that \nbecause of our actions today, America will be more fortified against \nthe evils of terrorism.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, for the last day and a half, the Senate \nhas been debating the antiterrorism bill conference report. During \ndebate, a number of motions to recommit the legislation to conference \nwere offered.\n  I voted against all of them--even those with which I agree on the \nsubstance. In this situation sending the bill back to conference would \nnot be simply a matter of adding back provisions that we in the Senate \nlike. Sending the bill back to conference would reopen the legislation \nto countless changes that the House might, in turn, demand that the \nSenate accept.\n  Obviously this conference report is not perfect. No bill is. Frankly, \nthere are some provisions I wish were still in there, and others I \nwould gladly see dropped. For example, I would have liked to see in the \nfinal bill the Boxer amendment on the statute of limitations for \nfirearms violations. But I recognize that the nature of a conference is \ncompromise. And therefore the package before us is the only one on \nwhich we can act.\n  In conclusion, I might add, I do not believe that the door is finally \nshut on amendments such as the Boxer amendment. We can hopefully \nrevisit that amendment on another bill.\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the conference \nreport on the Terrorism Prevention Act. This bill takes many important \nsteps in the fight against terrorism. In particular, several key \nprovisions will significantly strengthen U.S. efforts to combat \ninternational terrorism. In recent years, attacking terrorism has taken \na back seat in U.S. foreign policy. Attacks have been waged against \ninnocent people and allies across the world, and yet terrorists are \ninvited to the White House where their violent rhetoric has been \nconveniently overlooked.\n  In January 1994, Gerry Adams, the leader of the Irish-national \npolitical organization Sinn Fein, was granted a visa on a Presidential \nforeign policy waiver to travel to the United States. In doing this, \nthe National Security Council overruled a unanimous recommendation from \nthe Department of State, the Department of Justice, and the \nintelligence community that the waiver should not be granted due to the \nfact that neither Adams nor the Irish Republican Army have really \nrenounced violence in theory or in practice. This exception represents \nthe current administration's ability to pay lipservice to stopping \nterrorism while failing to achieve substantive results.\n  In the past, Adams had been denied a visa eight times by previous \nadministrations because of his affiliation with the terrorist \norganization. But since obtaining a visa in January 1994, Adams has \nreceived seven additional visas from the Clinton administration, was \nreceived by State Department officials, introduced to National Security \nAdvisor Anthony Lake, raised money throughout the United States while \ntouring in March 1995, and celebrated St. Patrick's Day in the White \nHouse. All of this transpired even though he has yet to renounce the \nuse of violence to achieve political goals or denounce the plague of \nterrorist bombings in Great Britain.\n  We cannot continue to project such an inconsistent and unflattering \ntestament of our commitment to fight terrorism. The legislation we now \nconsider addresses many of the shortcomings in our ability to deal \nstrongly and effectively with terrorism. The provisions in S. 735 will \nsignificantly strengthen our authority to combat international \nterrorism, and three sections in particular are worth noting.\n  Section 221 of this bill amends the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act \nto permit jurisdiction of U.S. courts for lawsuits against terrorist \nstates, as designated by the Secretary of State. Under current law, \nU.S. citizens are barred from suing foreign governments or state-owned \nforeign enterprises unless the alleged injury is directly related to \nthe commercial activity of the foreign government. In other words, \nAmerican citizens can be tortured or murdered in a foreign state by \nagents of that state, and if that state provides no effective legal \nremedy, the American victims and their families have no enforceable \nlegal remedy either in the United States or anywhere else in the world. \nThe provision in section 221 will now allow victims of terrorism, \nhostage taking or torture abroad, or their survivors, to seek \nrestitution against a state sponsor of terrorism when they are unable \nto gain relief in the courts of the country involved.\n\n  This provision provides vital remedies for victims. Just last summer \na United States district court barred survivors of Pan Am 103 victims \nfrom suing Libya even though the United States Government had found \nLibya to be directly responsible and two Libyans had been indicted in \nUnited States court for the crime.\n  It is important to note that section 221 provides a responsible \navenue for victims to seek just compensation. This is a powerful and \nsignificant tool that should be used cautiously. Thus the legislation \nlimits the scope of jurisdiction to only those countries who have been \nidentified as state sponsors\n\n[[Page S3464]]\n\nof terrorism. Sovereign immunity is designed to protect nations from \nbeing dragged into another nation's courts for legitimate sovereign \nacts. The international community, however, does not recognize the \nright of any state to commit acts of torture, extrajudicial killing, \naircraft sabotage, or hostage taking. Sovereign immunity is an act of \ntrust among nations of good faith. When a terrorist state harbors or \nsupports known terrorists, or injures or kills American citizens, it \ndestroys that trust and should not be allowed to avoid the accusations \nof those it harms.\n  Beyond ensuring that American citizens have recourse after brutal \nterrorist acts, this section represents a vital counterterrorism \nmeasure. I am confident that the threat of enforceable judgments and \nlevies against assets from U.S. courts will be a significant inducement \nfor countries to get themselves off of the State Department's terrorist \nlist.\n  Section 323 also provides an important tool in combating \ninternational terrorism. As a result of international pressures against \nstates which provide support to international terrorists, some \nterrorist groups are seeking other means of financing and support, such \nas raising funds from sympathizers or establishing front companies. \nDuring its investigation of the Bank of Credit and Commerce \nInternational [BCCI], the Senate Foreign Relations Committee unearthed \na significant trail of funding through BCCI that demonstrated the \nimportance of international financial networks in the support of \nillegal and terrorist activity abroad. The bank hosted many illegal, \nunsafe, and unsound banking practices, as well as acting as a front for \nworldwide arms deals, drug deals, and assistance to various groups \nlinked directly or indirectly to terrorist activity. Section 323 will \nenable U.S. prosecutors to begin to crack down on the use by terrorist \ngroups of international financial institutions and front companies for \ntheir material support.\n  This provision would create a new offense of providing material \nsupport or resources, or concealing the nature, location, source, or \nownership of material support or resources, for various terrorist-\nrelated offenses. Currently, an individual responsible for building a \nbomb or taking someone hostage can be prosecuted for their activities, \nbut those providing financial or technical support, or harboring \nterrorists after the crime, can escape punishment of any kind. Section \n323 criminalizes a series of offenses by recognizing all forms of \nmeaningful assistance and material support to terrorists.\n\n  It amends current law which was originally offered with the same \nintent as section 323, but was severely weakened in conference, \nrendering it virtually ineffective. This language strengthens current \nlaw by restoring the original intent of punishing all persons involved, \nto whatever degree, in terrorist activities.\n  Finally, section 411 which allows the exclusion of alien terrorists \nfrom the United States is an extremely important tool in combating \ninternational terrorism. Currently we have a loophole in our \nimmigration law that permits the United States to issue visas to know \nmembers of terrorist organizations. How can America expect to condemn \nother nations who support terrorists without first taking action to \nlimit the organizational efforts of known terrorists in the United \nStates? We must slam the door on foreign members of such terrorist \norganizations who now freely travel to our country.\n  The case of Sheikh Rashid Ghanoushi's application for a visa to the \nUnited States highlights the far-reaching consequences of our limited \nexclusionary authority. Ghanoushi is an Islamic extremist whose \nterrorist organization was responsible for the deaths of many innocent \ntourists in Tunisia. He was convicted in absentia.\n  Nonetheless, in 1993, he applied for a visa to travel to the United \nStates to speak to religious and academic audiences. In June 1994, the \nGovernment of Tunisia indicated that it would regard a United States \ndecision to admit Ghanoushi as a hostile act. Furthermore, in the past \nGhanoushi has urged violence against United States interests and \ncontinues to demand Israel's destruction. Yet the United States has \nstill not issued a final decision about whether to grant a visa to him, \nclaiming lack of authority to deny him entry. At present, Ghanoushi's \ncase is under active review by the State Department.\n  It is well known that many foreign terrorist groups depend on money \nraised in the United States to fund their activities abroad. Terrorist \nactivity should not be defined by the area in which a bomb explodes.\n  Our Nation, with its many democratic freedoms, represents fertile \nground for terrorist organizations for fundraising, organizational \nsupport, and international recognition. Many of these terrorists \norganizations have already developed networks of support in our \ncountry.\n  The existing loophole in the Immigration Act of 1990 permitting \nmembers of terrorist organizations to come to the United States \nfostered an atmosphere of indecisiveness. It sends the wrong signal to \nthe international community. The provisions in section 411 correct this \ninconsistency and effectively strengthen our authority to combat \nterrorism and keep those people who are members of terrorist \norganizations off of U.S. soil.\n  In the past decade, Americans have suffered numerous terrorists \nattacks. Without the authority and support created by S. 735, \nparticularly the three sections I highlighted, we will continue to \nneedlessly hamstring our ability to protect American citizens. Enough \nis enough. It is time to take bold steps to protect American citizens \nfrom the threat posed by terrorism. We know the obstacles currently \nfacing us in the fight against international terrorism. S. 735 provides \nthe tools and the authority necessary to wage an effective defense.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, this Friday will be the first anniversary of \nthe brutal and cowardly bombing of the Alfred P. Murrah Federal \nBuilding in Oklahoma City. One hundred and sixty-nine Americans, \nincluding 19 children tragically lost their lives in this terrible act \nof domestic terrorism.\n  A year later, that terrorist bombing continues to tear at the \nNation's soul. As we continue to mourn the loss of so many innocent \nlives, our hearts go out to the survivors, the families of the victims \nand the courageous residents of Oklahoma City who have already begun \nthe difficult healing process.\n  However, part of the process of healing begins with the pursuit of \njustice. And for the past year, law enforcement officials have \ntirelessly labored to see that the full force of the law is brought to \nbear on the guilty parties. And soon, the trial against the alleged \nbombers will begin.\n  But, as we continue the process of providing answers to this terrible \ntragedy--the deadliest terrorist attack on American soil--we must find \nnew and innovative ways to prevent such acts in the future. That's what \nthis bill is all about.\n  While no one will argue that this legislation, or for that matter any \nlegislation, will finally and completely end terrorism, we must take \nthe necessary steps to deter terrorists from their deadly actions. We \nmust make it more difficult for them to kill and injure. And we must \nensure that they are swiftly brought to justice.\n  President Clinton deserves praise for moving forcefully in that \ndirection by submitting a comprehensive counter-terrorism proposal to \nCongress, after the Oklahoma bombing.\n  Unfortunately, in the year since the President introduced that \nproposal, Congress has dragged it's feet on this legislation. What's \nworse, I believe, many of the strongest elements of this bill have been \nwatered down or eliminated by the House of Representatives.\n  Several provisions that would make it easier for law enforcement \nagencies to utilize multipoint and emergency wiretaps against suspected \nterrorists were removed.\n  The failure to include these wiretap provisions in the final \nconference report create a situation where it is easier for the FBI to \ntap the phone of someone they suspect of bribing a bank officer than \nsomeone who may be prepared to engage in a terrorist act.\n\n  What's more, this conference report prevents the Attorney General \nfrom requesting technical and logistical support from the military if \nour Nation faced an emergency involving biological and chemical \nweapons.\n  This provision was deleted even though I think everyone in this body\n\n[[Page S3465]]\n\nwould agree that the military has far more expertise in matters of \nchemical and biological weapons than our law enforcement agencies.\n  It's particularly disheartening that while these provisions were \noverwhelmingly agreed to by the Senate, they were removed from the \nfinal conference report because of the intransigence of the other body.\n  Similarly, while we need to find ways to prevent prisoners from \nabusing the legal process, by filing meritless appeals, we must ensure \nthat those people who have been unfairly convicted have some legal \nrecourse.\n  Unfortunately, I believe that the habeus corpus reform measures in \nthis bill are ill-advised. They limit the ability of inmates to raise \nclaims of innocence based on newly discovered evidence and also require \nFederal courts to defer to State courts on issues of Federal \nconstitutional law raised by these claims.\n  However, while I feel this legislation could be further strengthened \nif it were recommitted to the conference, there are enough positive \nelements in the bill that allow me to vote for it.\n  This counter-terrorism legislation provides Federal law enforcement \nofficials with the proper means to investigate and prevent terrorism. \nIt establishes new Federal offenses to ensure that terrorists do not \nelude justice through gaps in the current law.\n  Similarly, it increases penalties for terrorist actions. And it gives \nnew assistance to victims of terrorist attacks, including provisions \nthat will make it easier to bring lawsuits against States that sponsor \nterrorism. Combined, these steps will give law enforcement important \nnew tools to use in the fight against terrorism.\n  Although it is not perfect, this bill will not only help the Nation \nprevent terrorist acts but it will also help hold terrorists \naccountable for their actions.\n  The bombing in Oklahoma made clear just how vulnerable we all are to \nthese terrible acts of violence. And ultimately, I believe this \nlegislation will make Americans safer from the scourge of international \nand domestic terrorism.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I rise in support of this conference \nreport which embodies compromise antiterrorism and anticrime \nlegislation. I recognize that many Members would like to see additional \nprovisions added. We have waited too long, however, to allow this \nopportunity to pass without enacting legislation which will help us \navoid additional disasters such as Oklahoma City and the World Trade \nCenter bombings. I thus support this conference report as it stands and \nwill continue to work to pass additional measures which will combat \nterrorism, whether sponsored by foreign entities or by domestic \nextremists.\n  This bill provides $1 billion for enhanced law enforcement efforts, \nboth at the Federal and State levels, to combat terrorism. Plastic \nexplosives will be required to be tagged with materials which can be \ntracked back to the source in the event of a bombing. Foreign \nterrorists will be denied the opportunity to raise money inside the \nUnited States, and if found here, will be subject to special, but \nconstitutional, deportation proceedings. The bill also includes \nnumerous important and noncontroversial provisions which will remove \nlegal impediments to combat terrorism.\n  This bill also contains one of the most important anticrime and \njudicial reform measures passed in years. Finally, the charade of \nhabeas corpus appeals will be reformed: death row inmates will no \nlonger be allowed to drag out their appeals for several decades. I have \nfaith that our State courts respect our constitutional rights, and in \nthe exceptional case where Federal rights have been violated, \ndefendants retain very reasonable access to Federal courts to prove \ntheir innocence.\n  We have come to a crossroads in this debate almost 1 year after the \ntragedy in Oklahoma. Either we pass this bill and begin reaping the \nprotections it will provide us in the fight against terrorists, or we \nthrow up our hands and give up. I believe we need this bill now and I \ncommend the efforts of Senator Hatch and others to reach a reasonable \nconsensus which can pass both houses and be signed into law by \nPresident Clinton.\n  Mr. PELL. Mr. President, today, as the Senate considers the \nconference report to S. 735, the Antiterrorism and Effective Death \nPenalty Act of 1996, I regret that as I did when this bill was \npresented for passage in the Senate, I again must oppose the final \nversion of the bill. I do so for two basic reasons.\n  First, the conference did nothing to change those provisions of the \nbill which drastically curtail the Federal judicial protections \nafforded those given the death penalty in State courts. This is a \ndeparture from a longstanding tradition in English and American \njurisprudence and, as an opponent of the death penalty, I feel I cannot \nin good conscience support it.\n  Second, the conference removed several of the most effective \nantiterrorism measures that were included in the Senate version of the \nbill. These include giving the FBI the ability to employ court-approved \nmultipoint wiretaps, adding terrorism crimes to the list of those for \nwhich wiretaps can be approved, including terrorism crimes under RICO \nstatutes, and permitting the use of military expertise to cope with \neither chemical or biological weapons of mass destruction. Without \nthese provisions, I believe that the bill has been severely compromised \nand, in the process, the chance to do something truly meaningful about \ndomestic and international terrorism in this bill has been lost.\n  Accordingly, I believe that the conference report fails to correct \nthe deficiencies of the legislation that left the Senate last summer \nand furthermore, has eliminated many of its most effective \ncounterterrorism provisions. Thus, I continue to oppose passage of this \nlegislation.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I will vote for S. 735, I am distressed \nthat a number of the strongest antiterrorism provisions of the Senate \nbill were dropped in conference with the House. For example, I am \ndisappointed that the conference report would not--Provide the Attorney \nGeneral the enhanced tools for fighting domestic and international \nterrorism that were requested by the administration and included in the \nSenate bill; permit the Attorney General to utilize the expertise of \nthe military in investigations of crimes involving the use of chemical \nand biological weapons; or prohibit the dissemination of information on \nmaking explosive materials with the knowledge that the information will \nbe used for criminal activities.\n  On balance, however, I conclude that the antiterrorism provisions in \nthe bill, viewed as a whole, are still worth enacting.\n  The habeas corpus provisions of the bill are also problematical. \nUnder the conference report, an application for a writ of habeas corpus \nmay be granted if the underlying State court decision was ``contrary \nto, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established \nFederal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States.''\n  I interpret the new standard to give the Federal courts the final say \nas to what the U.S. Constitution says. I reach this conclusion for two \nreasons.\n  First, several Members have raised the concern that the reference in \nthe bill to an unreasonable application of Federal law could create two \ndifferent classes of constitutional violations--reasonable and \nunreasonable. I vote for the bill because I have confidence that the \nFederal courts will not do this. I believe the courts will conclude, as \nthey should, that a constitutional error cannot be reasonable and that \nif a State court decision is wrong, it must necessarily be \nunreasonable.\n  Second, I note that this provision permits a Federal court to grant a \npetition for habeas corpus if the State court decision was contrary to \nFederal law. I interpret this language to mean that a Federal court may \ngrant habeas corpus--on a first petition--any time that a State court \nincorrectly interprets Federal law and that error is material to the \ncase. In other words, if the State court's interpretation of the U.S. \nConstitution is wrong, this standard authorizes the Federal courts to \noverturn that interpretation.\n  The provision in the bill refers to ``clearly established Federal \nlaw, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States.'' I \nunderstand this provision to refer to the whole body of Supreme Court \njurisprudence on substantive and procedural rights. If the Supreme \nCourt has adopted a clear rule\n\n[[Page S3466]]\n\nof law and that rule has been consistently interpreted and applied by \nthe courts of appeals, that rule--and its consistent interpretation and \napplication--would prevail in habeas corpus proceedings.\n  In sum, Mr. President, I believe that this standard can be \ninterpreted in a manner that is consistent with the fundamental duty of \nthe Federal courts to act as the final interpreters of the meaning of \nthe U.S. Constitution, and to protect the constitutional rights of \nAmericans.\n\n\n                      Unanimous-Consent Agreement\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the only \nremaining motions to recommit in order to the pending conference report \nbe the following: Two additional Biden motions; further, that the \nmotions be limited to the restrictions previously agreed to, and that \nfollowing the debate on all motions and the conference report, the \nSenate proceed to vote on or in relation to the pending motions, to be \nfollowed by a vote on the adoption of the conference report, all \nwithout any intervening action or debate, with the exception of using 6 \nminutes, equally divided, for debate prior to the final passage vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Motion to Recommit\n\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I am offering a motion to recommit the \nconference report with instructions to add provisions relating to a \nthird type of wiretap that was deleted, referred to as an emergency \nwiretap.\n  I send the motion to recommit the conference report to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Delaware [Mr. Biden] moves to recommit the \n     conference report on the bill S. 735 to the committee of \n     conference with instructions to the managers on the part \n     of the Senate to disagree to the conference substitute \n     recommended by the committee of conference and insist on \n     inserting the following:\n\n     SEC.   . REVISION TO EXISTING AUTHORITY FOR EMERGENCY \n                   WIRETAPS.\n\n       (a) Section 2518(7)(a)(iii) of title 18, United States \n     Code, is amended by inserting ``or domestic terrorism or \n     international terrorism (as those terms are defined in 18 \n     U.S.C. 2331)'' after ``organized crime''.\n       (b) Section 2331 of title 18, United States Code is amended \n     by inserting the following words after subsection (4):\n       ``(5) the term `domestic terrorism' means any activities \n     that involve violent acts or acts dangerous to human life \n     that are a violation of the criminal laws of the United \n     States or of any State and which appear to be intended to \n     intimidate or coerce a civilian population or to influence \n     the policy of a government by intimidation or coercion; or to \n     affect the conduct of a government by assassination or \n     kidnapping.''.\n       (c) This section shall be effective one day after enactment \n     of this Act.\n\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I do not plan on taking the entire allotted \ntime on this side with this motion.\n  Let me be real clear about this. This provision was not in the Senate \nbill. It was offered by Senator Lieberman, and it was strongly \nsupported by many in this body. But it was not in the original Senate \nbill.\n  This provision incorporates the President's proposal to expand \nemergency wiretap authority. Today, emergency wiretap authority is \navailable for organized crime cases. This proposal simply makes it \navailable for terrorism cases. This proposal says that what is fair for \nthe mob is fair for Hamas. What is good for John Gotti is good for any \nterrorist from abroad. What is good for those involved in organized \ncrime is good for terrorists. If the justification exists for organized \ncrime in and the mob, why does it not exist for crimes of terrorism?\n  Let me first explain what an emergency wiretap is, because \nunderstandably a lot of people--I know many, like the Senator from Utah \nand the Senator from Pennsylvania, Senator Specter, and the Senator \nfrom Vermont, Senator Leahy, all former prosecutors understand these \nwiretap requirements, but many do not.\n  An emergency wiretap--I will explain more precisely not only what it \nis but how it is limited. First of all, in all cases--or in most \ncases--the Government must go to a judge to get a court order before it \ncan initiate a wiretap. But at the same time, Congress recognized there \nare emergency situations where time is of the essence and that \ncompleting the necessary paperwork and getting the judge's order will \nsimply take longer than the situation allows.\n  I have gone through today probably a half hour's worth laying out \nprecisely the safeguards built into getting a wiretap for a crime that \nis listed in the Criminal Code as being able to get a wiretap for, and \nhow long and difficult the process is and should be. But the Congress \nin the past has recognized that there are situations under current law \nwhich allow the Government to initiate a wiretap without a court order. \nHere are the circumstances: where immediate danger, death, or serious \nphysical injury exists; where conspiratorial activities threaten the \nnational security, or a conspiratorial activity characteristic of \norganized crime activities exist.\n  Only the top three Justice Department officials--the Attorney \nGeneral, the Deputy Attorney General, and the Associate Attorney \nGeneral--have the authority under the present law to issue or to \nauthorize any emergency wiretap.\n  If the law stopped there, I would agree with those who object to this \namendment. I would agree that it does not go far enough to protect our \ncivil liberties if all it said was one of the three top the Justice \nDepartment officials can initiate a wiretap. But the law does not stop \nthere now. It does not allow Federal officials to operate on their own \nfor long. Indeed, it requires that if the Attorney General authorizes \nan emergency wiretap for any one of those three circumstances I \nmentioned, they must nonetheless go before a Federal judge within 48 \nhours and make a case that probable cause exists for this wiretap prior \nto the authorization of the wiretap, prior to the time the tap started. \nPrior to that time, they have to prove there is probable cause that the \nsubject was committing a specific crime. The officials also must \nconvince the judge that they could not have completed the necessary \napplication prior to beginning the wiretap.\n\n  And, of course, if the judge concludes that either they could have \ncompleted the application in the necessary time or that there was no \nprobable cause at the outset, then none of the evidence, no matter how \nincriminating, that is acquired as a consequence of the emergency tap \ncan be used in court against the target. If the judge does not buy it, \nenforcement will have blown their case. Not only must the wiretap stop, \nbut none of the evidence obtained by the tap can be used against the \ntarget.\n  This is a powerful check on the Government's power. You can bet that \nthey are not just going to go around willy-nilly exercising--the top \nthree officials of the Justice Department--emergency authority because, \nif they do, they will lose their evidence if they turn out to be wrong, \nwhich means they will lose their case, which means the bad guys go free \nand all the time investigating up to that point will have been wasted \nand blown. That is not what law enforcement wants.\n  I want to repeat. Why, if we give this authority, this very limited \nand proscribed emergency authority to the Government, to the \nprosecutors, to the Attorney General of the United States, to deal with \norganized crime, why does it not make sense to allow them to deal with \nHamas or deal with a terrorist organization?\n  The last time I looked, the Mafia had not blown up a Federal \nbuilding. The last time I looked, the Mafia had not blown up the World \nTrade tower. They are real bad guys, and I have spent the bulk of my \ncareer as a U.S. Senator on both the Intelligence Committee and the \nJudiciary Committee passing laws and working to nail the Mafia. But if \nan emergency wiretap is good enough for John Gotti, why is it not good \nenough for the Unabomber? If the emergency wiretap is good enough for \nJohn Gotti, why is it not good enough for some wacko who blows up or is \nabout to blow up a Federal building in Wilmington, DE, or Washington, \nDC?\n\n  I want to repeat. To give this authority to the Government when it \ncomes to organized crime, why not for terrorists?\n  Of course, wiretapping is a powerful and intrusive tool. That is why \nthe current wiretap statute contains a number of restrictions to \nprevent the abuse of emergency wiretaps, none of which would be changed \nby this amendment.\n\n[[Page S3467]]\n\n  Let me repeat. Only the top officials at Justice--the top three, \nthose who have the most at stake in an investigation being blown by bad \nevidence--can authorize such a tap. Even then, they have to go to the \ncourt within 48 hours and must adhere to all the strict guidelines for \ngetting a court order in the first instance. If they do not get the \ncourt order, none of the evidence is able to be used.\n  Let me emphasize. This amendment does not in any way weaken what the \nGovernment must show to get a wiretap order. Law enforcement still must \nshow that some particular person has or is about to commit some \nparticular crime. And this provision only applies to cases of \ninternational domestic terrorism, which is further defined as--let me \ndefine what this would apply to and only what it would apply to: \nactivities that involve violent acts, or acts dangerous to human life, \nand which appear to be intended to intimidate or coerce the civilian \npopulation, or to influence the policy of the Government by \nintimidation or coercion, or to affect the conduct of a Government by \nassassination or kidnapping.\n  Why, if in fact they believe that any one of those circumstances \nexist, should they not, with all the safeguards built in, be able to \nget an emergency wiretap?\n  Let me say, although I have no illusions that this will pass, that I \nhope we will continue to demonstrate by the votes we have heretofore--\nover 45 and as many as 48 of our 100 colleagues felt strongly about \nthese issues. These are not frivolous undertakings. These are not \nfrivolous motions. All but one of the amendments I have offered, I \nbelieve, has gotten over 40 votes. I think they have all gotten over 45 \nvotes, so we are pretty evenly divided on this. I just want to make \nsure that before final vote on this conference report, that I do \neverything in my power to make this a much more useful tool in fighting \nterrorism.\n  Again, I know my colleague--and I respect him--is going to say if \nthis passes it will kill the bill. I cannot believe that this will kill \nthe bill. If we cannot put 35, or whatever number that is the number \nquoted by the House, Members of the House in the position where they \nhave to yield on what would be an incredibly strong bill only because \nthey are worried that we now allow terrorists to be treated the same \nway as John Gotti and the mob, then I think--I doubt whether they will \nvote that way because I doubt whether many of their constituents will \nkeep them around if they vote that way. And quite frankly, if they vote \nthat way, it is best for all to see. If they vote that way and defeat \nthe conference report, we could come back with an amended report and \npass what we have. So this will not kill the bill, but I am sure that \nis going to be stated.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. HATCH addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Bennett). The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, again, in the real world, in the case of \nthe Unabomber or a terrorist where there is a real threat or an \nimmediate concern, you do not need this provision to get an emergency \nwiretap. All the Senator's motion does is expand the number of crimes \nthat would trigger the wiretap statute. This amendment was offered \nduring the Senate debate. It was defeated. It was not a part of the \nSenate bill. It was not a part of the House bill. It is not a part of \nour conference report, and rightly so. I oppose this provision that \ncould expand emergency wiretap authority to permit the Government to \nbegin a wiretap prior to obtaining court approval in a greater range of \ncases than the law presently allows. I personally find this proposal \ntroubling. I am concerned that this provision, if enacted, would \nunnecessarily broaden emergency wiretap authority. Under current law, \nsuch authority exists when life is in danger, when the national \nsecurity is threatened, or when an organized crime conspiracy is \ninvolved. In the real world, we do not need this amendment to get \nemergency wiretap authority, and that is a fact.\n  Let me also say that this authority is constrained by a requirement \nthat surveillance be approved by the Court within 48 hours, but that \nauthority already exists in those areas I have addressed.\n  Now, this proposal of the distinguished Senator from Delaware would \nexpand those powers to any conspiratorial activity characteristic of \ndomestic or international terrorism. I do not think that expansion is \nnecessary to effectively battle the threat of terrorism. You can get \nthat emergency authority now. In the Unabomber case, no question; when \nterrorist acts are threatened, no question. I think that the opinion of \nmany, many experts would agree with this analysis.\n  Now, it is also very important to note that it is not 35 \nconservatives over in the House that are against this. The vast \nmajority of people against this amendment happen to be liberals who are \nvery concerned with an unwarranted expansion of wiretap authority and \nsurveillance authority. I have to say now there is an increasing number \nof libertarian conservatives who are becoming more concerned over law \nenforcement and some of the approaches that have been taken. I \npersonally believe that those concerns are not justified.\n  On the other hand, they are legitimate concerns, and they arise \nprimarily out of the Waco and Ruby Ridge and Good Ol' Boys Roundup, and \nother types of law enforcement mistakes that really were made. I have \ncalled them mistakes. Some people have felt that they should be \ncharacterized a little stronger than that.\n  Frankly, I am proud of the law enforcement agencies of this country. \nI know these people. I know what wonderful people they are. I know how \nmuch they risk their lives for you and me. But we do not need this \nauthority in order to do emergency wiretaps in these particular areas.\n  At this point, I should like to yield 5 minutes to the distinguished \nSenator from California, who has asked me for some time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I very much thank the distinguished \nchairman of the Judiciary Committee for this opportunity. I did have an \nopportunity to speak yesterday, but there is something I omitted to say \nthat I very much felt was part of this discussion.\n  What happened in Oklahoma City was brought home to us in California \nlast Friday. Early that morning, about 9 o'clock, there was a phone \ncall that came into the Vacaville headquarters of the Labor \nDepartment's Mine Safety Administration, and the caller said, using \nsome expletives, ``You guys are all dead. Timothy McVeigh lives on.''\n  Later that afternoon, a mine safety inspector by the name of Gene \nAinslie, who worked with the Department of Labor, was returning from \ninspecting a mine in Sierra County and he dropped off his official car. \nHe got into his pickup truck, met his wife, started out on Interstate \n80 to return to Sacramento, and the pickup truck exploded. A bomb had \nbeen placed on that truck.\n  Gene and Rita Ainslie are hospitalized today in serious condition--\nactually, today is their 32d wedding anniversary--Gene, with shrapnel \nin his legs and severe burns, and his wife with a broken ankle and a \ndislocated hip, but they survived. I and every Member of this body send \nthem our fondest greetings and let them know that our hearts and \nthoughts are with them both.\n  This was not a random act of violence. It was not a deranged \nindividual on a shooting spree. It was a deliberate and, once again, \ntargeted attack on a representative of the U.S. Government, an attack \nthat was aimed at murdering a Federal employee. This is not an isolated \nincident, and we have all seen them happening. There will be a study \nthat will released very shortly, an annual study of terrorism. And what \nit will show is that, for the first time, the United States of America \nis listed among the top 20 nations experiencing the highest level of \nterrorism and political violence in the world.\n  I was shocked when I heard this. According to the study, there were \n44 incidents reported to the authorities in the United States, an \nincrease of 200 percent since 1988. With this number of incidents, \naccording to this study, we ranked ahead of Lebanon.\n  I only say this because of the particular pertinence of the \nlegislation before us today. We relate the legislation to the Oklahoma \nCity bombing a year\n\n[[Page S3468]]\n\nago, but in fact even last Friday an incident took place in the State \nof California.\n  I think we also need to look at what is happening in our society that \nis fostering so much hatred and disregard for human life, and what can \nbe done to restore the values of justice and respect for the rule of \nlaw that really made this the greatest democracy on Earth.\n  I do not believe this is about restoring faith in our Government. I \ndo not believe right thinking people resort to this kind of violence \nbecause they think they pay too much in taxes or because they are angry \nat Government red tape. I think there really is no justification and no \nrationale for this kind of behavior.\n  But what does concern me is that the report I get from California is \nthat there are very disspirited Federal employees, that morale is low, \nand that some, for example those affected by the bomb last Friday, \nreally do not know that anybody cares about them. And what I want them \nto know, and I know I am joined by every Member of this Senate, is \nthat, in fact, we do care about them. We do know that Federal \nemployees--every member of the Army and the Navy who went to the Gulf \nwar was a Federal employee, every park official is a Federal employee--\nthese people take the job not for the money, certainly, but because \nthis is the way they want to serve their Nation.\n  They are entitled to respect, and it is our job to see that they have \nthat respect. So, as we pass this bill, which I hope we will do \nshortly, as a kind of living memorial to what happened in Oklahoma \nCity, I think we have to do it with a view that these events are taking \nplace in this Nation daily, just as it happened last Friday near \nSacramento and Vacaville in the State of California.\n  I say to Gene Ainslie, 56 years old, celebrating his 32d anniversary \ntoday with his wife Rita, and all those who labor as part of the \nFederal Government, that we Americans do respect them, that we do honor \nthem, and we will do everything in our power to see that this kind of \nbehavior is not inflamed, but rather it is put to an end.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah has 5 minutes and 13 \nseconds.\n  Mr. HATCH. Is there any other time remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware has 4 minutes and 9 \nseconds.\n  Mr. HATCH. I am prepared to yield back the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. BIDEN. I am prepared to yield back the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. HATCH. Then we will both yield the remainder of our time.\n  Can we proceed to the next amendment?\n\n\n                           Motion To Recommit\n\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, my colleagues will know this is the last \nmotion I have.\n  I offer a motion to recommit the conference report with instructions \nto delete the section relating to the study of Federal law enforcement. \nSenator Kohl of Wisconsin wishes to be added as a cosponsor as does, I \nbelieve, although I am not certain, Senator Nunn. I will check that. \nBut Senator Kohl for certain.\n  I send a motion to recommit the conference report to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Delaware, [Mr. Biden], moves to recommit \n     the conference report on the bill S. 735 to the committee of \n     conference with instructions.\n\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of the \nmotion be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The motion is as follows:\n\n       Motion to recommit the conference report on the bill S. 735 \n     to the committee of conference with instructions to the \n     managers on the part of the Senate to disagree to the \n     conference substitute recommended by the committee of \n     conference and insist on deleting the text of section 806 of \n     the conference report.\n\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, just for the sake of discussion, if there \nwere 10 very important provisions in this bill when we passed it out of \nthe Senate, it has come back to us with 4--I am not being literal--with \nfewer than we sent over. Fewer than 50 percent of the provisions that I \nthink are important in this bill remain in the bill.\n  In truth, when the Senator and I got to conference, there were \nprobably only 10 percent of the provisions we thought important in the \nbill. To the credit of the Senator from Utah, he was able to get back \nadditional provisions in the bill. For that I compliment him.\n  What I have been fighting about all afternoon here is trying to add \nback provisions that I think were mindlessly removed and removed tools \nthat we could make available to law enforcement to protect my children \nand me and all of us in this Chamber and around this country.\n  This is the one portion of the conference report that I am seeking to \ndelete that has made the bill worse than when it went out of here. Up \nto now I have been arguing that we sent a bill out of here with a lot \nof good things that the House stripped out and I wanted to put them \nback in. Not only did the House take out the bulk of the really good \nthings that were invaluable to fight terrorism, but it added some \nthings which I think are counterproductive. One of them is pandering to \nthis concern of some Americans that the bad guys are the cops, the bad \nguys are the Government, the bad guys are the FBI or the ATF or the \nJustice Department.\n  I do not believe we should go forward with an antiterrorism bill that \nhas a study in it only of police and not terrorists. For that reason, I \npropose to delete the study of the police in this bill. I think it is \nmore of an affront than it is a substantive problem. If we do not \ndelete this, we will be faced with a conference report that studies \ncops but not terrorists.\n  Let us remember who has literally laid down their lives in the \ndefense of our Nation and our way of life. It is the Federal law \nenforcement officers, not the terrorists. This study will provide \nnothing but a forum for those who believe the Federal law enforcement \nis the enemy of the American people and not the protectors. We are \nunwittingly aiding and abetting that notion by deciding that, in a \nterrorism bill, we are going to study the cops.\n  The study says, section 806, Commission on the Advancement of Federal \nLaw Enforcement.\n\n       (a) Establishment.--There is established a commission to be \n     known as the ``Commission on the Advancement of Federal \n     Law Enforcement'' (hereinafter in this section referred to \n     as the ``Commission'').\n       (b) Duties.--The Commission shall review, ascertain, \n     evaluate, report, and recommend action to the Congress on the \n     following matters:\n       (1) The Federal law enforcement priorities for the 21st \n     century, including Federal law enforcement capability to \n     investigate and deter adequately the threat of terrorism \n     facing the United States.\n       (2) In general, the manner in which significant Federal \n     criminal law enforcement operations are conceived, planned, \n     coordinated, and executed.\n       (3) The standards and procedures used by Federal law \n     enforcement to carry out significant Federal criminal law \n     enforcement . . .\n       (4) The investigation and handling of specific law \n     enforcement cases . . .\n       (5) The necessity for the present number of Federal law \n     enforcement agencies and units.\n\n  Get that? We are going to study the necessity, the necessity of the \npresent number of law enforcement agents and agencies. What is the \nimplication of that? The implication of that is there are some bad law \nenforcement agencies out there. I assume this is the right's attempt to \ngo after the Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms. I do not know. That is who \nwe are studying. We are going to study the cops, not the terrorists.\n  We have to study the location and efficacy of the office or entire \nentity responsible, aside from the President, for the coordination of \ninteragency bases of operation, programs and activities of all Federal \nlaw enforcement agencies.\n  It goes on, by the way, for another half a dozen sections.\n  Think about this. Many of us were local officials before we came \nhere. How many times did a very small segment of our community come to \ntell us that we had to set up commissions and we had to set up outside \norganizations, we had to set up police review boards, and so on, \nbecause they did not like the cops? Sometimes it was necessary. But \nremember how good cops responded to this.\n  I spoke with Director Louis Freeh today. He called me--the Director \nof the FBI. Of every single thing in the\n\n[[Page S3469]]\n\nbill, this is the thing that most concerns him because of what it says \nto the American people about what we in the Congress think about our \nlaw enforcement agencies, the very people who probably have captured \nthe Unabomber; the very people who have gotten hold of, apparently, the \nman or men who blew up the World Trade Center, as well as the Federal \nbuilding in Oklahoma City; the very people who, just a couple of weeks \nago, outside of my State in neighboring Pennsylvania, were shot down \ndead, protecting people in Philadelphia--FBI agents, the very people \nwho, increasingly, are losing their lives fighting crime and terrorism.\n  These are the people who we are going to investigate. There is not \neven a parallel study in here to investigate malicious, to investigate \norganizations that, in fact, raise questions, to investigate--separate \nissue--terrorist, per se, organizations. We are going to investigate \nthe cops.\n  I can remember the years during the Reagan era. We talked about how \ndemoralized the military felt and, to Reagan's great credit, in my \nview, one of the things I agreed with him on is he built up the morale \nof the military, after years of being beaten about the head after \nVietnam.\n  These guys need our support, Mr. President. These women need our \nsupport. They do not need us yielding to the NRA and others insisting \non a study--a study of them in a terrorism bill.\n  That is the study we are going to make. We are fighting terrorism, \nand every law Federal law enforcement officer in the Nation, guarantee \nyou, knows that we spend an entire page of this bill--that is not true, \nhalf a page of this bill--laying out extensively what we are going to \nstudy, the people we are going to appoint to study this and, listen to \nthis:\n\n       (1) Number and appointment.--The Commission shall be \n     composed of 5 members appointed--\n\n  By whom?\n  One member appointed by the President pro tempore in the Senate; one \nby the minority leader of the Senate; one by the Speaker of the House; \none appointed by the minority leader of the House; one member who shall \nchair the Commission will be appointed by the Chief Justice of the \nSupreme Court.\n\n       (2) Disqualification.--A person who is an officer or \n     employee of the United States shall not be appointed a member \n     of the Commission.\n\n  How is that? Why cannot someone who is an officer of the U.S. \nGovernment--what a field day these wacko Freemen out in Montana are \ngoing to have when we pass this. I promise you, they are going to hold \nthis up--some of them, may not be those guys--but other wackos and say, \n``See, we're right, the U.S. Congress thinks we have to study these \npeople, and they don't even trust them enough to allow any Federal \nGovernment employee in any capacity to be on the commission.''\n  I think this is humiliating, absolutely humiliating. \nDisqualifications: you are disqualified if you are an officer or an \nemployee of the United States of America. That means any military \nperson could not be on the commission; it means the Chairman of the \nJoint Chiefs of Staff could not be put on the commission.\n  This is disturbing, and if you doubt what I am saying after this is \nover or before we vote, pick up the phone, call Louis Freeh, call any \nof the police officers you know and respect, call the people we count \non to protect our lives that we are studying them.\n  I see my friend from Utah is on his feet, and my friend from \nWisconsin who wishes to speak in favor of this motion is here. I will \nbe happy to yield to either one of them. How much time remains under my \ncontrol, Mr. President?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Three minutes 50 seconds.\n  Mr. BIDEN. I yield the remainder of the time to the distinguished \nSenator from Wisconsin.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. KOHL. I thank my friend from Delaware.\n  Mr. President, I rise to speak in support of this motion to recommit, \nand I also want to speak generally about the terrorism measure before \nus. In sum, we should approve this legislation because it is the best \nwe are likely to get and the best we can do for the victims of the \nOklahoma City bombing. But I believe the record should be clear that we \nshould have done better.\n  For many years, we have watched with growing concern as terrorist \nviolence has escalated and reached closer to our homes. We can no \nlonger ignore the fact that post-cold war violence knows no borders, \nand respects no distinction between soldiers and innocents.\n  For that reason, Senators Biden and Specter and myself introduced \nlegislation to fight international terrorism last February. We \nbroadened our legislation to reach domestic terrorism after Oklahoma \nCity. And building on this, the Senate overwhelmingly supported a \nstrong, bipartisan proposal.\n  That is not the proposal we are debating, however, today. We are now \nconsidering a version of that bill which is far more watered down.\n  Still, if we cannot enact a strong and decisive antiterrorism bill, \nthis measure will do at least some good. For example, it will still \nprovide law enforcement with new weapons to choke off terrorist \nfundraising, new powers to deport suspected terrorists, and the ability \nto ``tag'' plastic explosives. All of these provisions will help reduce \nthe threat of terrorism, all are constitutional, and in their entirety \nthey make this measure worth saving.\n  Unfortunately, other parts of the conference report are more \nproblematic. The conferees deleted Senate provisions that would prevent \nnew technology from undermining our wiretap laws. The conferees \nprohibited the military from using its resources to help fight chemical \nand biological weapons.\n  And the conference also added some troubling items. For example, our \nsubcommittee held 14 days of hearings on Ruby Ridge and issued a report \nthat was praised across the political spectrum--by Janet Reno and by \nmilitia leaders. So why do we need to have a so-called Commission \nreopen this matter? Similarly, why does a study of cop-killer bullets \nsuddenly appear in this bill? Is this really necessary? Is it really an \nimportant part of our fight against terrorism?\n  I believe the answer is no.\n  The best arguments against the motions to recommit seem to be this: \nDon't let the perfect be the enemy of the expedient. Or we have to \naccept the bad in this bill to finally enact some of the good.\n  Well, in a certain sense that is true. But America should clearly \nunderstand that this is not what we here in the Senate agreed to. \nAmerica should know that this legislation has been used to forward a \npolitical agenda that does not advance the cause of preventing \nterrorist acts. America should understand that while this bill does \nsomething for the memories of the Oklahoma City victims, it could have \ndone much more.\n  So I will support this conference report--on balance it is better \nthan no bill at all--and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, this Commission will explore issues \nsurrounding the future and mission of Federal law enforcement as we \nenter the 21st century. Among other things, the Commission will assess \nour efforts to prevent and investigate future acts of domestic and \ninternational terrorism. It will consider the pressing issues facing \nlaw enforcement as crime rates rise and as criminals become more \nsophisticated.\n  I appreciate the fact that the law enforcement community is sensitive \nto this sort of review, but this Commission is different in focus, and \nwe made it different in focus in the conference from the House-passed \nversion. What was once a Waco-Ruby Ridge Commission with subpoena power \nis now a Commission to help Congress set Federal law enforcement \npriorities for the 21st century. It is a Commission which, in my \nopinion, will help law enforcement. I must say to my friends in the law \nenforcement community that I only learned of their concerns after the \nreport was filed. If there are specific areas of the Commission's scope \nwhich are truly troublesome, I will work with them to try to address \ntheir concerns.\n  It should be noted that the last time a Commission looked at Federal \nlaw enforcement was over 60 years ago in 1931. In that year, the \nCommission on Law Observance and Enforcement, established by President \nHoover, better\n\n[[Page S3470]]\n\nknown as the Wickersham Commission, made public its recommendations to \nCongress.\n  In a report signed by its chair, former Attorney General Wickersham, \nthe Commission concluded that the growth of interstate crime, an \ninterstate organized crime network, and interstate property and \neconomic criminal activities, mandated the need for an increased \nFederal role in law enforcement.\n  At that time, the findings and recommendations of that Commission \nwere truly a major contribution to the fight against crime in this \ncountry.\n  There is more I have to say on this. At the appropriate time, I will \nmove to table both of the Biden motions, because this Commission is \nthought to be extremely critical by people in the House. We have bona \nfide it to make it more palatable to those who object to it, and I \nbelieve we bona fide it to a degree that it can be acceptable.\n  On the other hand, we will continue to look at this language after \nthis bill is passed, and I will continue to listen to law enforcement \nand others who are concerned and see what we can do to resolve their \nconcerns.\n  I am pleased to yield 10 minutes to the distinguished Senator from \nPennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished chairman of the \nJudiciary Committee for yielding this time.\n  I support this legislation because I think it makes important \nimprovements in our fight against terrorism and also in our fight \nagainst violent crime in the United States.\n  The additional $1 billion will be an enormous help to the FBI and law \nenforcement officials to fight terrorism. The Subcommittee on \nTerrorism, which I chair in the Judiciary Committee, held extensive \nhearings after the Oklahoma City bombing. There is absolutely no doubt \nabout the need for more resources by the FBI. The FBI Terrorism Center \nwill provide a clearinghouse which will be of enormous aid and \nassistance.\n  As is frequently the case, the bill is not entirely to my liking or \nthe liking of anyone. There are a couple of provisions which concern me \nthat I want to comment about because they may be cured at a later date.\n  On the provision relating to expedited deportation, I am concerned \nabout the absence of a right of confrontation. There is a \nconstitutional right to confront your accuser in a criminal case. A \ndeportation proceeding is not a criminal case. It is defined as a civil \ncase, but the consequences are extreme because a person is ousted from \nthe country. There are very important policy considerations to not \nallowing the right of confrontation because many of the witnesses are \nconfidential informants and the disclosure of their testimony would be \nvery harmful to ongoing law enforcement efforts.\n  We do have an unclassified summary, included in an amendment offered \nby Senator Simon and myself, and I think that is about as far as we can \ngo. But I believe we have to watch how the act works on this expedited \ndeportation proceeding in the absence of a confrontation right.\n  The restrictions on fundraising are also important. I have some \nconcern about the limited judicial review, but on balance, this \nlegislation against terrorism is very, very important. I am glad to see \nthat we are finally acting on it.\n  Attached to this terrorism bill, Mr. President, are provisions \nrelating to modifications of habeas corpus which limit the time for \nappeals on death penalty cases. This has been a long time in coming to \nthis country. It is something that I have worked on personally for more \nthan a decade, based upon the experience I had as the district attorney \nof Philadelphia. We currently have the death penalty applied and then \nthere are delays of up to 17 years while the cases languish in the \nFederal courts. Most of the arguments about these provisions are made \nby people who are opposed to the death penalty. The lengthy appeals \nprocess in the Federal court has, in effect, defeated the deterrent \neffect of the death penalty.\n  I am personally convinced, Mr. President, that the death penalty is a \ndeterrent. I saw many cases in my 12-year tenure in the Philadelphia \ndistrict attorney's office, 4 years as an assistant DA trying murder \ncases and 8 years as district attorney, arguing appellate cases where \nthe death penalty was imposed, and I am convinced that professional \nburglars do not carry weapons for fear of the death penalty when it is \ntimely. But the only way a deterrent can be effective is if it is \ncertain and reasonably swift. The time limits established in this bill \nare very, very important. They break new ground.\n  I first offered these time limits, Mr. President, in 1990. After a \nlong, tough debate we got these time limits established by a 52-to-46 \nvote. They were incorporated again in 1991, passed by a narrow vote of \n58 to 40. In 1993, habeas corpus was left out of the crime bill, and I \noffered these provisions. They were defeated on a motion to table. \nSenator Hatch and I later collaborated on the Specter-Hatch bill. It is \nnot too easy to come ahead of Senator Hatch on a bill, but I did. \nSenate bill 623 established those time limits and they are incorporated \ninto this final bill. They will require that anyone on death row has to \nfile a habeas corpus proceeding within 6 months if counsel is provided, \nunder State law, or within 1 year if counsel is not provided.\n  Mr. President, I think that we should have included provisions for \ncounsel. They are not in this bill. I think that is a serious mistake. \nI hope it is a mistake we can correct at a later time.\n  When you talk about inmates languishing on death row for up to 17 \nyears, you are talking about a problem for the system, you are talking \nabout a problem for law enforcement, you are talking about a problem \nfor the victims' relatives, and you are also talking about a problem \nfor the defendants themselves on death row.\n\n  The European Court on Human Rights decided that it was cruel and \nbarbarous treatment, cruel and inhumane treatment, to keep someone on \ndeath row for 6 to 8 years. There was an extradition case which came up \nwhere somebody was accused of murder in the first degree in Virginia, \nwhich had the death penalty, and extradition was sought from Germany. \nThe Court denied extradition on the ground that it would be cruel, \nbarbarous, and unusual treatment to keep someone in jail for lengthy \nperiods of time, for 6 to 8 years. Obviously, 17 years is an extension \nof the time which was held to be cruel and barbarous treatment.\n  This bill provides a limitation on time so that the district court \nmust decide the case within 180 days, 120 days for brief and hearing, \nand 60 days for decision. I have been involved in these cases in the \nState court. I have been involved in habeas corpus proceedings as a \ntrial counsel in the Federal court. What the judges do is put these \ncases on the back shelf. There is no reason they cannot give these \ncases priority treatment. Now they will have to. The Congress of the \nUnited States recognizes judicial independence on what judges decide, \nbut in terms of timetable, we have the authority to establish \ntimetables, and we have done so under the Speedy Trial Act of years \nago. Even in the jurisdictions which have a tremendous number of death \npenalty cases, like Texas, California, and Florida, the judge does not \nhave more than one of these cases every year and a half. So they can \nput these on the expedited trial list.\n  This bill also provides that there will not be repetitive decisions, \nbecause the court of appeals will be the gatekeeper.\n  Mr. President, I inquire how much time I have remaining of my 10 \nminutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 2 minutes.\n  Mr. SPECTER. That tells me how brief I have to be.\n  We have had repetitive petitions filed. They have been a major \nirritant in the Federal court system. The idea of the Court of Appeals \nas a gatekeeper came to me from a law school classmate, Judge Jon \nNewman, chief judge of the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit.\n  I am concerned, Mr. President, about a couple of provisions. I think \nthe bill is too restrictive in limiting the ability to present a claim \nof innocence, requiring that it be proved by clear and convincing \nevidence. I joined Senator Levin in seeking to change that standard. \nBut the reality is that the standard of proof is a very variable thing. \nI\n\n[[Page S3471]]\n\nthink if it is established innocence, it may not make a whole lot of \npractical difference, but I think clear and convincing evidence is too \nhigh a standard from a theoretical point of view.\n  Similarly, I do not favor the deference which is allowed to the State \ncourt decision, requiring that it has to be unreasonable in order for \nthe Federal court to overturn it. But I think in a Federal habeas \ncorpus proceeding, if the court thinks it is unreasonable, it will be \nable to overturn the decision, notwithstanding a standard that is \nreally not as precise as it ought to be.\n  I think the exhaustion requirement is misplaced here. We would be \nbetter off without it. But the net effect, Mr. President, is that this \nlegislation is very good legislation taken as a whole. It will help out \non terrorism with the additional resources. We have a tremendous \nproblem in this country with the potential for terrorism. We have seen \nit in the World Trade Center bombing. We have seen it in Oklahoma City. \nIn my capacity as the chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, I \nsee a lot of problems which we cannot discuss openly, but we can move \nfor the additional resources.\n  On law enforcement, the death penalty is the law of the land in 37 \njurisdictions in this country. It is favored by more than 70 percent of \nthe American people. If States do not want it, they do not have to have \nit. But the States that do have it ought to have it enforced. I think \nthe overwhelming weight of authority is that it is a deterrent. These \nprovisions are fair to the defendant. The European Court on Human \nRights held it cruel and unusual punishment to impose a delay of more \nthan 6 to 8 years.\n  So it is fair to the defendant. Certainly it provides closure for the \nvictims' families, and it will reinvigorate law enforcement by taking \nout the habeas corpus provisions which really made the death penalty a \nlaughingstock. So in total I think it is a good bill.\n  I commend all of my colleagues who have worked on it in the House. I \nthink we will see passage of something which will be very, very \nsignificant for law enforcement in this country.\n  Mr. President, violent crime has been one of the worst problems faced \nby the people of our country for several years. Homicide rates, fueled \nby illegal drugs, spiraled upward in the 1980's. While the rate of \nviolent crime has recently started to decline, there remains far too \nmuch violence in our society. And while the violent crime rates are \ndown, the future is grim: the rate of murder and violent crime \ncommitted by children under 17 is soaring, and the number of youth in \nour society is increasing. Therefore, we may expect another surge in \nviolent crime unless we take action.\n  There are many avenues to take to curb violent crime. We need a \nbalanced approach that includes law enforcement, drug prevention and \ntreatment, crime prevention programs and other means of steering \njuveniles away from drugs and crime.\n  Based on my personal experience as an assistant district attorney and \nas district attorney of Philadelphia, I am convinced that the death \npenalty is an effective deterrent to violent crime. Criminal justice \nexperts agree that in order for any penalty to be effective as a \ndeterrent, it must be swift and certain. When years pass between the \ncommission of the crime and the carrying out of the sentence, the link \nbetween crime and punishment is broken.\n  The great writ of habeas corpus is the means by which criminal \nconvictions and sentences in State court are reviewed in Federal court \nto ensure that the trial satisfied the requirements of the U.S. \nConstitution. It has been an indispensable safeguard of constitutional \nrights in this country, especially since the 1930's when the Supreme \nCourt began reviewing State-court convictions in cases like the \nScottsboro case. Unfortunately, the Federal courts have gone too far in \nhabeas corpus cases. These cases drag on for years, and there is no end \nto them, as inmates, especially those on death row with nothing to \nlose, file endless rounds of petitions.\n  There is no statute of limitations for filing habeas corpus \npetitions. This leads inmates who have been sentenced to death to wait \nuntil they are facing their imminent execution before filing their \nhabeas corpus petition in Federal court. An example of this abuse is \nthe case of Stephen Duffey in Pennsylvania. Duffey murdered his victim \nin 1984. His conviction was finally upheld by the Pennsylvania courts \nin 1988. His death warrant was not signed until 1994, 10 years after \nthe murder. It was only when the death warrant was signed by the \nGovernor that Duffey first sought habeas corpus review in Federal \ncourt.\n  The requirement that all claims raised in Federal habeas corpus \npetitions be presented and fully adjudicated by State courts has also \nled to excessive delays and unsound rules as to whether Federal courts \ncan even consider a habeas corpus petition.\n  The case of Michael Peoples, which I have discussed with my \ncolleagues on numerous occasions, shows graphically how the exhaustion \nrule leads to excessive formalism and delay. People was convicted of a \nvicious robbery in 1981, and his conviction was upheld by the \nintermediate Pennsylvania appellate court in 1983. The Pennsylvania \nSupreme Court denied review by an order that did not make it clear \nwhether it was based on the merits or on the court's procedural \ndiscretion not to hear cases that do not present a substantial legal \nissue. Peoples then filed a habeas corpus petition in 1986. The \ndistrict court denied the petition for failure to exhaust his State \nremedies. The Court of Appeals for the third circuit then reversed on \nthe ground that the exhaustion requirement had been satisfied when the \nPennsylvania Supreme Court denied review. Peoples then appealed to the \nU.S. Supreme Court, which granted review--making the case 1 of just 147 \nit heard that year out of over 4,550 petitions for Supreme Court \nreview--and reversed the third circuit. On remand, the third circuit \nissued a complicated ruling finding that Peoples' habeas petition \ncontained both exhausted and unexhausted claims and sent the case back \nto the district court. Years were spent considering just this initial \nprocedural hurdle of exhaustion. I believe we would have been better \nserved had the courts simply reviewed the substance of Peoples' claims.\n  Another problem causing the excessive delay in carrying out death \nsentences has been the ability of inmates to file repeated habeas \ncorpus petitions. Once again, I turn to an example I have often \ndiscussed with my colleagues, the case of Robert Alton Harris. After \nbeing convicted of a double murder in a California court in 1980, \nHarris filed over the next 14 years 10 petitions for State post-\nconviction relief and five Federal petitions for habeas corpus. The \nSupreme Court of the United States considered 11 different applications \nrelating to the Harris case. Many of the petitions Harris filed \ncontained similar or overlapping claims, although none raised doubts \nabout his guilt. Finally, after 14 years, Harris was executed. I regret \nto say that the Harris case is far from unique in its multiple habeas \ncorpus filings.\n\n  Abuse of the writ of habeas corpus has led to the death penalty being \nnot an effective deterrent, but a mockery. Inmates on death row spend \nan average of over 9 years awaiting execution. And may wait much \nlonger, with some cases dragging on 18 or more years. During these \nperiods of lengthy delay in carrying out death sentences, the families \nof the victims are left in a sense of suspension, unable to put the \ntragedy behind them.\n  Putting an end to these excessive delays will once again restore \nvitality to the death penalty as an effective deterrent to violent \ncrime, which I know from personal experience it is. I have told my \ncolleagues on numerous occasions over the past several years about the \ncase of Cater, Rivers, and Williams, three young hoodlums who I \nprosecuted as an assistant district attorney. These three were planning \non robbing a Philadelphia pharmacy. When Cater and Rivers saw that \nWilliams was carrying a revolver, they told him they would not \nparticipate in the robbery if he took the weapon because they feared \nthe death penalty. Williams put the gun in a drawer, but as the three \nwere leaving, Williams sneaked it back into his pocket. Williams used \nthe gun in the commission of the robbery to kill Jacob Viner, the \npharmacist.\n  All three men convicted and sentenced to death because, under the \nlaw, Cater and Rivers were equally responsible for Viner's murder as \nWilliams.\n\n[[Page S3472]]\n\nUltimately, Williams was executed, but Cater and Rivers had their \nsentences commuted to life imprisonment because they were unaware that \nWilliams had carried the gun. As a prosecutor, this case was just one \nof many I encountered in which burglars and robbers refused to carry \nfirearms because they feared the death penalty.\n  In order to make the death penalty once again an effective deterrent, \nI have actively been attempting to streamline habeas corpus procedures \nsince 1990. When the Senate considered anticrime legislation that year, \nI offered with Senator Thurmond an amendment to reform habeas corpus \nprocedures to speed up and streamline the process. My amendment was \nadopted by the Senate, 52 to 46, and included in the final bill. \nUnfortunately, at the insistence of the House conferees, the provision \nwas dropped from the conference report adopted the last day of the \n101st Congress.\n  In the 102d Congress, I introduced legislation, S. 19, that was \nsubstantively identical to the 1990 amendment the Senate had passed. \nWhen the Senate considered anticrime legislation in 1991, however, \nSenators Hatch and Thurmond offered a slightly different habeas corpus \nreform amendment that was based on my legislation but included language \nlimiting the scope of Federal review of State convictions. After \ncareful consideration, I spoke at length in favor of that amendment and \nvoted for it. This amendment also passed the Senate, 58 to 40, and \nincluded in the final bill that passed the Senate. When the bill went \nto conference, however, the House insisted on its habeas corpus \nprovisions which, rather than reducing delays and streamlining the \nprocess, would have allowed for greater delay and more manipulation of \nthe process. The conference report that contained that provision was \nfilibustered in the Senate because of its habeas corpus provisions and \nnever came to a vote.\n  Once again in the 103d Congress, I introduced legislation similar to \nmy previous efforts. When the 1993 anticrime bill was debated in the \nSenate, the managers decided that habeas corpus reform was too tough an \nissue to resolve and remove the bill's habeas provisions. I strenuously \nobjected and brought before the Senate a bill I introduced to \nstreamline the process. While many of my colleagues wanted to see us \ntake action on the bill, it was tabled in order to keep the habeas \nissue from interfering with efforts, which I also supported, to secure \nFederal assistance for police hiring and prison construction.\n  When Republicans took control of the Senate and House this Congress, \nI had high hopes that we would finally be able to resolve the issues \nthat had previously derailed efforts to reform habeas corpus. Together \nwith Senator Hatch, I introduced legislation, S. 623, to impose a \nstatute of limitations on the filing of habeas corpus petitions, \nrestrict the ability to file successive petitions, impose time limits \non Federal court consideration of habeas petitions in capital cases, \nand encourage States to provide adequate counsel in capital habeas \ncases.\n\n  In the wake of the Oklahoma City bombing, as the Senate developed \nantiterrorism legislation, I worked to ensure the inclusion in the bill \nof my habeas corpus reform legislation. As introduced and passed by the \nSenate, S. 735 includes in full the provisions of S. 623. When the \nHouse ultimately considered its antiterrorism bill, it included my \nhabeas corpus reform language as well.\n  As I mentioned, there are several aspects of the habeas corpus reform \nprovisions that I would prefer were different. Most glaringly is the \nrestrictive standard of review. The bill continue to require deference \nto State courts' findings of fact. Federal courts will owe no deference \nto State courts' determinations of Federal law, which is appropriate in \nour Federal system. However, under the bill deference will be owed to \nState courts' decisions on the application of Federal law to the facts. \nUnless it is unreasonable, a State court's decision applying the law to \nthe facts will be upheld. I am not entirely comfortable with this \nrestriction, but upon reflection I believe that the standard in the \nbill will allow Federal courts sufficient discretion to ensure that \nconvictions in State court have been obtained in conformity with the \nConstitution.\n  I also believe that the formulation in the bill is too restrictive in \nlimiting successive petitions when the inmate raises a claim as to \ninnocence. For this reason, I supported Senator Levin's amendment when \nthe bill was initially considered by the Senate. That amendment, \nhowever, was tabled.\n  Finally, I am disappointed by the absence of two provisions from the \nhabeas corpus reform sections. Since 1990, I have been convinced that \nwe can improve the process by eliminating the exhaustion requirement. I \nhave tried repeatedly to do so. Both prosecutors and representatives of \nthe defense bar have strenuously objected to these efforts, albeit for \ndifferent reasons. Despite my certainty that the bill would be improved \nhad we eliminated the exhaustion requirement, I am willing to move \nforward without its elimination in the interest of getting habeas \ncorpus reform. I am also concerned that the bill does not establish \nstandards for trial counsel in capital cases. In my previous efforts I \nhad sought to ensure that the States provided adequate counsel in \ncapital cases at both trial and in the post-conviction process. \nImproving trial counsel in capital cases is a critical step to making \nthe trial rather than the habeas proceedings the central event in \ndeath-penalty cases. This bill, while seeking to ensure adequate \ncounsel for habeas proceedings, does nothing to strengthen the minimal \nconstitutional standard for ensuring adequate counsel at trial.\n  Despite the provisions that concern me and the failure of the habeas \nreform to include two elements important to a fair and comprehensive \nscheme of habeas reform, I support the habeas corpus reform provisions \nof this bill. In politics, one learns that the best is the enemy of the \ngood. Since the restoration of the death penalty in 1976, we have seen \nits effectiveness as a deterrent sapped by delays attributable to \ndefects in the habeas corpus system. The reforms included in this bill, \nwhile not perfect, will go a long way to restoring vitality to the \ndeath penalty as an effective deterrent to violent crime. I was \ntherefore willing to sponsor these provisions in conjunction with \nSenator Hatch and am please to see them enacted. They are the \nculmination of many years of effort, and I am deeply satisfied by their \nadoption.\n\n  We are, of course, dealing with an antiterrorism bill, and there are \nseveral provisions of the bill in addition to habeas corpus reform that \nI want to address briefly. As chairman of the Judiciary Subcommittee on \nTerrorism, I have long been interested in combating terrorism and have \nbeen very active in the area. In 1986, I introduced legislation that \nmade it a Federal crime to commit a terrorist attack against a U.S. \ncitizen anywhere in the world. I have also been active in seeking to \nlimit diplomatic immunity for terrorist acts and for punishing acts of \nterrorism before an international criminal court. Earlier this \nCongress, I joined Senator Biden and Senator Kohl in introducing S. \n390, the fist omnibus counterterrorism bill introduced this Congress, 2 \nmonths before the tragic Oklahoma City bombing that gave the issue such \ncurrency,\n  I am pleased that the conference report retained my amendment to the \nSenate bill to authorize assistance to U.S. allies to support the \npurchase of counterterrorism technology if U.S. interests are at stake. \nMy original amendment authorized $3 million for this assistance, but in \nthe wake of the recent terrorist bombings in Israel that have put the \npeace process at risk, the amount authorized in the conference report \nhas been increased to $20 million.\n  I also want to express my support for the provision to require the \nAttorney General to study the availability of bombmaking manuals, \nevaluate whether current laws are adequate to address the problem, and \ndetermine whether anything else can be done constitutionally. My \nJudiciary Subcommittee on Terrorism and Technology held a hearing on \nthis subject in May 1995. We were deeply troubled by what we heard. I \nam skeptical that the Government can do anything to restrict such \ninformation without violating the first amendment. I am pleased that \nthe Attorney General, whose representative testified at our hearing, \nwill study this matter and make appropriate recommendations.\n  The conference report adds a provision to make it a crime to misuse\n\n[[Page S3473]]\n\nhuman pathogens and other biological agents. The terrorist threat from \nsuch agents is very real. My Terrorism Subcommittee is conducting a \nstudy on this issue and the threat from chemical agents as well. I know \nthat the Governmental Affairs Committee has also held hearings on this \nsubject. Recently, the full Judiciary Committee held a hearing on the \nthreat posed by the wrongful use of human pathogens. After that \nhearing, I joined several other members of the committee in writing the \nPresident to express our concern over the gaps in Federal regulation \nover the distribution of human pathogens. I am pleased to see the \nconference report include this provision.\n\n  The conference report deleted the Senate-passed provision to \nauthorize the broader use of multipoint wiretaps. I opposed the \ninclusion of this provision in the Senate bill and am pleased to see \nthat the conferees deleted it. Current law strikes the appropriate \nbalance, and I feared the Senate-passed provision went too far in \nthreatening privacy interests.\n  I want to note that, while the conference report alters the expedited \ndeportation provisions of the Senate bill, adopted as part of an \namendment I offered with Senator Simon and Senator Kennedy, it \npreserves the requirement that if classified information is used to \ndeport an alien suspected of terrorist activity, an unclassified \nsummary adequate to permit the alien to mount a defense must be \nprovided to the alien. This requirement is the absolute minimum that \ndue process will permit. Anything less could not have survived \nconstitutional scrutiny, and I am pleased that this aspect of my \namendment was retained.\n  I am also troubled by the restrictions on domestic fundraising for \nforeign terrorist organizations. The Senate bill had allowed entities \ndesignated as terrorist to seek judicial review. That review would have \naccorded no deference to the administration's designation and allowed \nfull and searching judicial review. The conference report, while \nretaining judicial review, establishes a deferential standard for that \nreview. I am far less satisfied with this level of scrutiny. I am also \nconcerned about the first amendment implications of this provision, \nrestricting the ability of U.S. citizens to support favored causes. I \nacknowledge that the United States is a fertile ground of financial \nsupport for foreign terrorist organizations, but am nonetheless \nconcerned about these infringements on U.S. citizens.\n  Finally, I want to express my strong disappointment over the limited \nscope of the provision allowing U.S. citizens injured by foreign \nterrorist attacks to sue foreign nations who supported the attack in \nwhich they were injured. In 1993, I introduced the first bill in the \nSenate to allow U.S. victims of foreign terrorism to sue foreign \ncountries they suspected of supporting the terrorists who injured them. \nMy bill was favorably reported by the Judiciary Committee.\n  When the Senate considered this bill, it included a provision similar \nto but narrower than my bill as reported by the Judiciary Committee in \n1994, allowing suits against foreign nations for supporting terrorism \nonly if the State Department had previously listed the defendant nation \nas a sponsor of terrorism. The House bill contained a broader provision \nallowing suit in the U.S. against any foreign country that did not \nprovide due process in its own courts to remedy the injury to an \nAmerican citizen.\n  As the conference on this bill began, I wrote to each of the Senate \nconferees urging them to accept the House-passed provision. As the \nconference proceeded, I had thought that an acceptable compromise would \nbe reached. I deeply regret that the conference report rejected any \ncompromise and adhered to the Senate's provision, which allows the \nState Department to manipulate those foreign nations that are subject \nto suit in U.S. courts for injuring U.S. citizens. Giving the State \nDepartment this role is contrary to the rationale of the Foreign \nSovereign Immunities Act and will allow impermissible foreign policy \nconsideration to affect the ability of Americans to seek redress for \ntheir injuries caused by foreign governments. I will continue to work \non this issue to remove this unfair limitation.\n  This conference report is not all that could be hoped for. It does, \nhowever, represent a significant advance in our Nation's ability to \nfight terrorism without unduly compromising the rights and liberties of \nour citizens. As a result, I support the conference report and urge my \ncolleagues to do so as well.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah has 2 additional \nminutes.\n  Mr. HATCH. I yield back my 2 minutes. I understand the time of the \nminority is also expired.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. HATCH. On behalf of Senator Dole and myself, I move to table both \nof the Biden amendments, with the understanding that these votes are \nstacked.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HATCH. Could I also ask unanimous consent that the first vote be \n15 minutes in length, but the last two votes be 10 minutes each?\n  Mr. FORD. Reserving the right to object, Mr. President, I am not \nsure. Could you give me just a second?\n  Mr. HATCH. I will withhold that unanimous-consent request.\n  Mr. DOLE. Were the yeas and nays ordered?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The yeas and nays have not been ordered.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. DOLE. The first rollcall will be 15 minutes, and the next will be \n10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. FORD. The third will be 10 minutes. The first vote is 15 minutes, \nthe next two votes will be 10 minutes each.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, just short of a year ago, this country was \nrocked by an attack on the Alfred Murrah Federal Building in Oklahoma \nCity, OK. In the wake of that horrible incident, in only a matter of \nweeks, the Senate responded by passing the Dole-Hatch comprehensive \nantiterrorism legislation by a vote of 91 to 8 on June 7, 1995. Most of \nits provisions were drawn from earlier Republican crime packages. Over \nthe past month, we have worked in a bipartisan manner to craft what \nwould surely be the toughest antiterrorism bill ever to become law.\n  This week, to honor the memory of those who suffered in Oklahoma, the \nCongress will send to President Clinton this landmark bipartisan \nantiterrorism bill. It has the support of the Republican Governor of \nOklahoma, Frank Keating, and Oklahoma's Democratic attorney general, \nDrew Edmondson.\n  Under the leadership of Senator Hatch, we have a measure which would \ngive us the strong, upper hand in the battle to prevent and punish \ndomestic and international terrorism.\n\n  On March 27, 1996, I wrote to each of the conferees urging in \nparticular that the three important provisions in the Senate bill be \nretained. The first facilitates a speedy removal of suspected foreign \nterrorists from U.S. soil. The second keeps foreign terrorists from \nraising money for their activities in the United States. The third \nmakes membership in a terrorist organization the basis for exclusion \nfrom the United States.\n  Each of these is a commonsense protection for all Americans. Each of \nthese reforms is long overdue. I am pleased that Senator Hatch and the \nconferees insisted on keeping these important reforms in the bill.\n  Most importantly, the bill contains comprehensive, effective habeas \ncorpus reform, which has just been discussed by the distinguished \nSenator from Pennsylvania, Senator Specter, who, as he outlined, has \nbeen active in this area for many, many years.\n  I did visit the San Quentin State Prison in California about 6 or 8 \nweeks ago. There I met a father whose son had been murdered, a pretty \nclear-cut case, and it took 15 years--15 years--appeal after appeal \nafter appeal before justice was meted out and the person who committed \nthe murder was executed. There have been more people die of natural \ncauses in that prison than of the death penalty, because of the \nfrivolous appeals, appeal after appeal, costing the State millions and \nmillions of dollars. Obviously, we need to protect\n\n[[Page S3474]]\n\nthe rights of the defendant, particularly in capital cases, but in my \nview, it is a sad commentary that on death row in San Quentin, where \nthere are about 400-some inmates on death row, more will probably die \nof natural causes than because of the death penalty.\n  Maybe that will be changed because of this big, big step forward. I \nwant to commend Senator Hatch, Senator Specter, and others who have \nworked on this a long time. It has been more than a decade of \nefforts. We are about to curb these endless, frivolous appeals of death \nsentences by those convicted of murder. Habeas corpus reform is the \nonly substantive provision in this bill that will directly affect the \nOklahoma City bombing case. It is the heart and soul of the bill.\n\n  I sent a letter Monday to President Clinton. In that letter, I \nreiterated that we simply cannot continue allowing convicted murderers \nto appeal their sentences year after year. President Clinton has \nalready vetoed a similar reform of the death penalty appeals process. \nThe White House continued right up to the end, to argue for changes in \nhabeas corpus that would essentially gut this reform. I called on \nPresident Clinton to support us in this important effort and sign this \nbill when it is sent to his desk. America will not tolerate a second \nveto of habeas corpus reform.\n  I am very pleased, moreover, that the conference report provides \nvictims of terrorism the ability to sue foreign governments responsible \nfor terrorist acts in U.S. courts for the first time. On December 21, \n1988, 270 people were killed in the terrorist bombing of Pan Am flight \n103. This brutal act of terrorism killed more Americans than died in \nDesert Storm.\n  The Libyan Government was clearly responsible for this brutal crime. \nYet, Libya refuses to extradite the Libyan intelligence officials \nresponsible. I do not know anyone who believes there is a realistic \nchance that Qaddaffi will cooperate to bring killers he ordered to \njustice in a legitimate court.\n\n  For too long, the survivors of the victims have had no recourse to \nseek compensation from Libya. That's why the Dole-Hatch bill last year \ncontained authority for victims of international terrorism to sue \nterrorist states in U.S. courts. For 10 months the Clinton \nadministration fought this provision. For 3 years the Clinton \nadministration has had meetings with family members and had tough \nrhetoric--but there has been no real action to redress the tragedy of \nPan AM flight 103.\n  This week the Congress will enact this important reform. This is not \nrhetoric, this is action. This is historic and will, at long last, \nallow American victims of terrorism to use U.S. courts to try to seek \ncompensation for the vicious acts of terrorist states.\n  I am proud to have worked closely with the families of the Pan AM 103 \nvictims for many years, especially in the 1990 Aviation Security Act. \nNothing we do can possibly replace their loss, but we can give them a \navenue for partial justice.\n  Mr. President, yesterday I received a letter from Victoria Cummock, \npresident of the families of Pan-Am 103/Lockerbie. On behalf of those \nfamilies, she urged support of this bill. She focuses on two \nprovisions: habeas corpus reform; and opening up our courts to allow \nvictims their day in court against governments that sponsor terrorism. \nI ask unanimous consent that this letter be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the materials was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                             Families of Pan-Am 103 Lockerbie,\n\n                                                   April 15, 1996.\n     Hon. Bob Dole,\n     Senate Majority Leader,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Dole: On behalf of the victims' families of \n     Pan Am 103, I want to express our gratitude for your \n     leadership in the Anti-Terrorism bill (S-735), currently \n     pending in the Congressional Conference Committee. Your \n     support of two key provisions will enable American victims of \n     terrorism obtain justice in U.S. courts.\n       More Americans have died at the hands of terrorists than in \n     Desert Storm, or in any other American war over the past 20 \n     years. The bombing of Pan Am 103 was the single worst act of \n     terrorism against civilians in this country's history, \n     killing 270 people. For more than seven year, we--the \n     families--have waited for our country's help and support. \n     During that time terrorists blew up the World Trade Center \n     '93, injuring 1,000 and killing eight, and last year bombed \n     the federal building in Oklahoma City, killing 168.\n       On March 7, dozens of Americans victimized by terrorism \n     gathered in Washington, D.C. They included parents, widows, \n     and children from the families of Pan Am 103; 21 next of kin \n     from the Oklahoma City bombing; a daughter of Leon \n     Klinghoffer killed in the hijacking of the Achille Lauro; \n     Joseph Ciccipio and David Jacobson held hostage in Lebanon; \n     Scott Nelson tortured in Saudi Arabia, families of the \n     victims of the World Trade Center bombing, and Hans \n     Ephraimson-Abt, the 74-year old father of one of the victims \n     of KAL 007 shot down over the Soviet Union.\n       At great personal and emotional expense, they gathered to \n     support provisions of the anti-terrorism bill that would \n     enable us to achieve justice: limit immunity granted foreign \n     states that sponsor terrorism, and reform Habeas corpus.\n       Our motives are not political. Our lives and families have \n     been unraveled by terrorism, and justice is our only \n     consolation. Without justice and accountability there is no \n     deterrence. We want to live in peace knowing that other \n     Americans will be spared.\n       Countries that hide behind their sovereign immunity to \n     avoid U.S. courts will continue to encourage and sponsor \n     terrorist acts. For example, Libya, which is accused of \n     ordering the bombing of Pan Am 103, is also accused of the \n     1989 bombing of a French UTA plane of Chad. It killed 171.\n       Allowing convicted murderers to delay their execution for \n     17-24 years with their seemingly endless appeals is also \n     plainly wrong. It makes a mockery of our judicial system and \n     gives criminals more rights than their victims.\n       Dead Americans have no voice, their families must speak for \n     them. Four weeks ago the President made a request to Congress \n     to provide aid to the families of four Cuban Americans shot \n     down by Cuba. Has the President forgotten the hundreds of \n     other Americans murdered by terrorists? The promise that he \n     made to us before his election?\n       This nation cannot continue to allow countries to kidnap, \n     torture, and murder Americans and escape accountability. The \n     United States allow corporations to seek restitution in U.S. \n     civil court. U.S. law permits restitution for sabotaging a \n     plane full of chickens--but not people. This is an outrage. \n     The message sent to countries sponsoring terrorism is that it \n     is safe to target and kill Americans.\n       I want to be able to tell my three small children that \n     America stands with us and that their father's constitutional \n     right to justice (and that of other victims) will no longer \n     take a back seat to the rights of terrorists. By maintaining \n     the FSAI and Habeas Corpus provisions in the final language \n     of the anti-terrorism bill, Congress will give us the \n     opportunity to help ourselves. The changes we advocate are \n     right for all Americans; this reform is overdue.\n       Thank you for your commitment in helping American victims \n     of terrorism. Our hopes and prayers will be with all the \n     Congressional Committee members during their final \n     deliberations.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                          M. Victoria Cummock,\n\n                                         Widow of John B. Cummock;\n                                                        President.\n\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, in a few moments we will pass this bill. The \nCongress will put the national interest ahead of partisan interests. \nThose who have delayed passage of this historic bill argue that this is \na weak bill. This is wrong. It is unfair to those who have suffered or \nmay suffer in the future from the evil handiwork of terrorists and \nother criminals.\n  My colleagues have opposed these efforts. We will pass this bill \ntoday. As Diane Leonard, whose husband Don was killed in the Oklahoma \nCity bombing, said yesterday: ``It is the right thing to do.'' Then I \nhope President Clinton will do the right thing and sign the bill.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, what is the status of the bill?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time having expired, the question is on \nagreeing to the motion to table the motion to recommit offered by the \nSenator from Delaware.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I was under the mistaken belief that we \nwould have some extra time, but I would like to give some time before \nfinal passage, equally divided. I would like to be able to give 3 \nminutes to the two distinguished Senators from Oklahoma. That would \nmean 6 minutes to the minority.\n  I ask unanimous consent that we have 12 minutes, equally divided.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. FORD. Reserving the right to object, as I understand, prior to \nthe final vote?\n  Mr. HATCH. Prior to the final vote.\n  Mr. FORD. Six minutes.\n  Mr. HATCH.

Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. COHEN. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. BIDEN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I understand before the final vote there \nare 6 minutes allotted to each side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator will suspend. Senators to the left \nof the Chair will please take your conversations to the cloakroom. The \nSenate will please come to order.\n  The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I appreciate the indulgence of my \ncolleagues today in voting on these motions to recommit and the strong \nsupport of 40 to 48 Senators we have gotten on each of these votes. I \nappreciate that.\n  In the 6 minutes that I have to close, let me just suggest two \nthings. There is a good deal of change that has been made in the habeas \ncorpus provisions of the law, which, in my view--a broken record--will \ndo nothing to prevent terrorism. The habeas provision in this bill \ndeals primarily with State crimes, and the terrorism crimes we are \nconcerned about--Oklahoma City, the World Trade Center bombing, et \ncetera--are Federal crimes. It will not affect it at all.\n  But there is a provision in the bill that I would like to say \nsomething about. There's a section that says:\n\n       An application for writ of habeas corpus on behalf of a \n     person in custody, pursuant to the judgment of a State court, \n     shall be granted with respect to any claim that was \n     adjudicated on the merits in State court proceedings, unless \n     the adjudication of the claim, one, resulted in a decision \n     that was contrary to or involved in unreasonable application \n     of a clearly established Federal law as determined by the \n     Supreme Court, or resulted in a decision that was based on an \n     unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the \n     evidence presented.\n\n  I would like to make this brief observation.\n  As things now stand, Federal courts take State court decisions very \nseriously. They are not writing on a blank page and ignoring State \ncourt decisions right and left. In fact, court watchers who pay close \nattention to the cases tell me that Federal courts grant relief only \nwhen it is pretty clear that someone's constitutional rights have been \nviolated. So it seems to me that even under this provision of the law \nwe are now changing, which I think is inadvisable to change, but even \nunder this provision, if Federal courts think that State courts are \nright on the Constitution, they will uphold it. And if they are wrong, \nthey will not.\n  So if a State court makes an unconstitutional determination, the \nFederal courts will, and should, continue to say so. Therefore, I think \nthis is much less onerous--unnecessary but much less onerous--than, in \nfact, it may appear on its face.\n  If a Federal court concludes the State court violated the Federal \nConstitution, that, to me, is by definition--by definition--an \nunreasonable application of the Federal law, and, therefore, Federal \nhabeas corpus would be able to be granted.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I am truly gratified at the action that I \nbelieve the Senate is about to take. Passage of this legislation is \nurgently needed. This bill, passing at this time, will be a memorial to \nthe victims of terrorism. I was so moved the other day, when survivors \nof terrorism came here to Washington to plead again for enactment of \nthis legislation.\n  Since the Senate first acted last June, we have been working to reach \nthis point. The result of that effort is a conference report that, in \nmy view, deserves the support of every Member here. This legislation \nrepresents a landmark effort to address an issue of grave national \nimportance--the prevention and punishment of acts of terrorism. This \nbill includes long-needed reforms to Federal habeas corpus procedures \nand provides vital provisions for victims of terrorism and other \nFederal crimes. It also adds important tools to the Government's fight \nagainst terrorism, and does so in a temperate manner that is protective \nof civil liberties.\n  I have insisted from the beginning that this bill address the needs \nof the victims of terrorist acts, so I am particularly pleased about \nthe provisions we have included for them. Our commitment to the victims \nof terrorism is evident from the first two titles of the conference \nreport. These provisions are the heart and soul of this bill, and are \nthe only provisions which can provide solace to the victims of past \nacts of terrorism, such as Oklahoma City and Lockerbie:\n  Habeas corpus reform: This legislation includes tough, fair, and \neffective reform of Federal habeas corpus procedures. I have been \nfighting, along with\n\n[[Page S3476]]\n\ncrime victims across our Nation, for the enactment of this legislation \nfor nearly 20 years. Finally, heinous criminals will no longer be able \nto thwart justice and avoid just punishment by filing frivolous appeals \nfor years on end. Finally, crime and terrorism victims will know that \nour justice system means what it says.\n\n  Mandatory victim restitution: The mandatory victim restitution \nsection of this bill is the Hatch-Biden measure, and will ensure for \nthe first time that Federal courts must order violent criminals and \nterrorists to pay restitution to their victims. We all know that a \nprice can never be placed on the terrible costs these crimes inflict. \nWe also know that in far too many cases, repayment will fall far short \nof the cost we can calculate. However, with this bill, victims will \nfinally have the solace of knowing that the justice system recognizes \ntheir loss, and that the perpetrators of evil are held accountable.\n  Terrorism by foreign countries: This bill takes the important step of \nensuring that Americans who are harmed by foreign governments \ncommitting or directing terrorists acts can sue those governments in \nAmerican courts. Lawless nations will no longer be able to hide their \nterrorist acts behind the rules of international law that they \notherwise flaunt.\n  Oklahoma City trial: Finally, by providing for closed circuit viewing \nof the Oklahoma City trial by the bombing's victims and survivors, this \nbill also will ensure that these courageous people can observe justice \nbeing done, while still ensuring a fair and just trial for the accused.\n  The terrorism bill we are about to finalize also is a tough, \neffective measure. With its enactment, we will be better able to \nprevent and deter future terrorist acts. Moreover, we will be better \nequipped to respond to and punish these heinous acts should they occur.\n  First, for the first time since the tragic bombing of Pan Am flight \n103, it will be required that all plastic explosives manufactured, \nsold, imported into, or exported from the United States include \nchemicals to make them detectable by airport security. This provision \nwill help protect airline passengers from terrorist attacks and fulfill \nour obligations under international agreements.\n  Second, this legislation include important new measures to ensure \nthat access to dangerous human pathogens--like the agent that causes \nbubonic plague--is properly limited. This will help ensure that the \nAmerican people are not victimized by terrorists engaging in such \ntactics, such as the Japanese cult Aum Shinri Kyo that released cyanide \ngas in a crowded Tokyo subway.\n\n  Third, the bill we will send to the President provides law \nenforcement with the tools necessary to combat the threat of nuclear \ncontamination and proliferation that may result from illegal possession \nof nuclear materials.\n  Fourth, this antiterrorism bill will prohibit, in a constitutional \nmanner, fundraising in this country by specific, designated foreign \nterrorist groups. Once designated, these groups will no longer be \npermitted to use American-raised funds to spread terror here and \nabroad.\n  Fifth, this bill provides the Federal Government with the tools it \nneeds to exclude representatives and members of foreign terrorist \ngroups from the United States, and provides the Government with the \nability, within the bounds of due process, to deport alien terrorists \nwithout compromising national security.\n  This bill also: Increases the penalties for crimes committed with \nexplosives, as well as conspiracies to commit such crimes; curtails the \nuse of domestic and foreign use of weapons of mass destruction; \naddresses the increasingly global nature of terrorism, increasing \npenalties for terrorist acts that transcend national boundaries; \nimposes strict penalties for retaliatory assaults or murders of Federal \nofficers or employees; provides emergency response training to State \nand local law enforcement; and harmonizes security measures to provide \nAmericans flying to and from the United States on foreign airlines with \nthe same level of protection they receive for domestic flights.\n  In short, this bill reflects the unity of purpose and clarity of \nresolve with which we must meet the terrorist threat.\n  I am proud of the bill we have crafted. It is time for us to finish \nthe job, and pass this conference report. In doing so, it is my hope \nthat we recall the Americans who died at the hands of terrorists, not \nonly last month, but over the last 15 years or more. In Beirut, in \nLockerbie, in New York, and in Oklahoma City, victims of terrorism have \nhad their lives stolen by evil persons pursuing selfish and twisted \nagendas. We can honor these victims by completing the task at hand.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I yield 3 minutes to the distinguished \njunior Senator from Oklahoma.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma is recognized for 3 \nminutes.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I think anything that is said further \ntonight on this bill will be redundant, but I think some things are \nworthy of redundancy. I think it is virtually impossible for anyone in \nthis Chamber who was not in Oklahoma City when the tragedy happened--\nthe bombing of the Murrah Federal Office Building--to really appreciate \nthe significance of the trauma, the disaster, the emotions at the time.\n  I think it was well said in a magazine called Oklahoma Today, talking \nabout the first wave of the super-hot gas moved at 7,000 miles an hour, \nfast enough for someone 10 feet away to be hit with a force equal to 37 \ntons, and in about half a second the gas dissipated only to be replaced \nby an equally violent vacuum. The resulting pressure waved outward, \nlifting the building up and causing beams, floor slabs, and connections \nto weaken and collapse.\n  When the pressure wave passed, gravity took over. Nine stories of the \nnorth side of the building pancaked, creating a crater 30 feet deep. \nPeople who had been on the ninth floor ended up in the basement.\n  I think one of the most memorable experiences I had was the very \nfirst night. The firefighters had arrived. They were all volunteers. \nThey were taking turns 1 hour at a time crawling on their bellies \nthrough there to pull out parts of bodies. I actually saw on the first \nfloor human hair and one hand that was stuck to a wall. As they pulled \nthe bodies out--some alive, some dead--they did not know at that time \nwhether or not it would come crashing down and kill them. When one \ngroup came out after an hour, there was blood all over the individuals. \nThen you could hear the cadence, almost like you heard in World War II, \nof the firefighters marching down the streets to take their turn, and \nthis is what we experienced there.\n  The majority leader a few minutes ago said the habeas provision is \nthe heart and the soul of this bill. It may be that some of you do not \nagree with that, but I can assure you the families of the 168 victims \nwho died in the Murrah Federal Office Building, they believe that, \nbecause they came up here 2 months after the explosion and sat across \nthe table from many of the Senators in here and said, ``The one thing \nwe want in legislation is habeas reform. We do not want the same thing \nto happen as happened when Roger Dale Stafford in Oklahoma murdered \nnine Oklahomans and sat on death row for 20 years.''\n  So I guess all I can say is, on behalf of the families of the 168 \nvictims, those who lost their lives in the Murrah Federal Office \nBuilding, I appeal to you to pass this bill tonight.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, so that the majority gets to go last, I \nhave 2 minutes remaining.\n  What the Senator from Oklahoma just read was moving and significant. \nI am going to vote for this bill, but I am dumbfounded why, after \nreading what he just read and us knowing that, that we all voted in \nthis Chamber to allow someone to teach somebody how to build another \nfertilizer bomb, even if the person teaching knew or had reason to \nbelieve it would be used for a purpose like that.\n  Hear what I just said? ``Intended.'' If a person teaches someone how \nto build a fertilizer bomb intending that that be able to be done, a \ncrime to be able to be committed with it, we just voted not to put that \nprohibition into the law.\n  And now that you all are here and did not have a chance to listen to \nthis before, I hope you know, after we pass this bill, you will join me \ntomorrow, or\n\n[[Page S3477]]\n\nthe next day, to pass a law that says you cannot do that, because you \ninadvertently voted, when I tried to put it back in the law, to let \nsomeone now, legally, over the Internet or any other way, teach someone \nhow to build a fertilizer bomb, give them the details and intend that \nit be used that way, and it is not prohibited.\n  So I hope tomorrow when I am here, or the next day, listening to what \nthe Senator from Oklahoma accurately stated and believes deeply that we \nshould never let this happen again; we will correct the mistake that we \nmade here today.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I yield the last 3 minutes to the \ndistinguished senior Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, first I wish to thank the majority leader \nfor setting aside the immigration bill to take up this bill. I informed \nthe majority leader and the Speaker some months ago of my earnest \ndesire to pass this before this Friday.\n  This Friday is the 1-year anniversary of the worst civil disaster \nthat we have had in U.S. history: 168 innocent men, women, and children \nwere murdered in the Murrah Building bombing.\n  The majority leader responded to that request, and I appreciate it.\n  I also want to compliment Senator Hatch and Senator Biden and their \nstaffs, and also Chairman Hyde, for their willingness over the last 2 \nweeks when we were in recess to work out the differences, because the \nbills between the House and the Senate had a lot to offer, but there \nare significant differences in the bills.\n  But there were significant differences. They worked out those \ndifferences. They came up with compromises. That was not easy during \nthe break. That is not often done. But they did it so we can meet this \ndeadline. I very much appreciate their cooperation.\n  Mr. President, this is vitally important legislation. As my colleague \nfrom my State, Senator Inhofe, mentioned, this is very important \nlegislation to the families of the victims. There are hundreds of \npeople involved. Yes, there are 168 individuals who lost their lives, \nbut they have hundreds of family members, and actually I think it is in \nthe thousands, the relatives that are directly impacted, that lost a \ncousin, lost a dad, lost a son, lost a daughter.\n  We met with those individuals. They want this bill passed. This bill \nmay not be perfect. I know Chairman Hatch said that some of the other \nprovisions that were alluded to today, that he is happy to introduce \nthose and work on those in separate legislation. I compliment him for \nthat. But if we recommitted this bill, we would not have this bill. It \nwould not pass.\n  So I want to thank my colleagues on this side that voted against the \nmotions to recommit. This is a conference report. If we are going to \nget it passed, we are not going to be able to recommit it. So I will be \nhappy to work to make future improvements. But this is a good bill. It \ndoes have habeas corpus reform. It ends the abusive appeals. That is \ncertainly good for taxpayers and victims.\n  It does allow closed-circuit TV for families in the Oklahoma City \nbombing. Right now the trial, regrettably, is going to be in Denver. \nThat is over 500 miles from Oklahoma City. They want to be able to view \nthe trial and not have to move their families to Denver. We requested \nassistance from Justice, but they did not make it happen. We make it \nhappen in this legislation. That is good news for their families. \nSeveral of us will be with several thousand people. That will be good \nnews for Oklahomans.\n  Finally, I thank my colleagues for their bipartisan support. We put \nmandatory victim restitution in this legislation, something that the \nSenate has supported countless times. That is very significant and \nimportant and one of the crime reform packages we have had. We passed \nit in the Senate. Unfortunately, it has not come out of conference with \nthe House. It is in this bill. Again, I want to thank my colleagues, \nSenator Hatch and Senator Biden, because they supported that provision.\n  Finally, Mr. President, I want to urge my colleagues to vote for this \nbill. I will be very disappointed if this bill only has 60 or 65 votes. \nI hope it has 100 votes. This bill may not be perfect, but it is good \nlegislation. Also, I would like to urge the President of the United \nStates to sign it.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a letter from the \nGovernor of the State of Oklahoma to the President of the United States \nurging that the President sign this bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                                State of Oklahoma,\n\n\n                                       Office of the Governor,\n\n                                Oklahoma City, OK, April 16, 1996.\n     Hon. Bill Clinton,\n     United States of America, The White House, Pennsylvania \n         Avenue, Washington, DC.\n       Dear President Clinton: Congress will soon pass legislation \n     which will effectively combat terrorism. Having dealt with \n     the tragedy and aftermath of the Oklahoma City bombing, I \n     believe it is imperative that you sign this legislation into \n     law.\n       In addition to the tough law enforcement provisions aimed \n     at terrorists and their organizations, it includes provisions \n     of particular interest to those of us in Oklahoma.\n       First and foremost is effective death penalty reform, which \n     will end the delays and frivolous appeals by convicted death \n     row inmates. The importance of this provision has been made \n     clear by the families of the victims of the Oklahoma City \n     bombing, who have worked tirelessly to see this reform become \n     law so that justice may be swift and sure.\n       Second is a provision allowing for the closed circuit \n     viewing of the trial by families and victims who cannot be \n     accommodated by the courtroom in Denver. The viewing would \n     take place in Oklahoma and would allow these families and \n     victims to fully benefit from our victims' rights laws which \n     stipulate they be entitled to monitor the trial proceedings.\n       Mr. President, this bill deserves to be signed into law. \n     For the families and victims of the Oklahoma City bombing, it \n     represents a significant step in bringing closure to this \n     terrible tragedy. I urge you to approve this vital change in \n     our nation's laws to combat terrorism. It is the right thing \n     to do.\n           Very truly yours,\n                                                    Frank Keating.\n\n  Mr. HATCH addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote, and I move \nto lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I think this is a big victory for all of \nAmerica, but most of all for those folks who suffered in Oklahoma City, \nOK, and other terrorist incidents in the world.\n  I want to acknowledge the work of some people who were critical to \nthe passage of this bill--in particular, the\n\n[[Page S3478]]\n\nmajority leader. The majority leader, Bob Dole, is to be commended for \nhis leadership. Once again, Senator Dole has delivered for the American \npeople. I personally express my gratitude to our distinguished majority \nleader.\n  I also want to acknowledge the work of Chairman Henry Hyde over in \nthe House, and my fellow conferees, Senators Thurmond, Simpson, Biden, \nand Kennedy. Senators Nickles and Inhofe deserve mention, too, because \nthey never let this institution forget who this bill was for. All of \nthe survivors from the Oklahoma tragedy and the Pan Am disaster were \ncritical to this bill's passage. So they all deserve our thanks.\n  I want to mention a few of the other people who worked on this bill, \nas well--in particular, the staffers who worked long hours out of deep \ncommitment to public service. Jeanne Lapatto, Christina Rios, Nick \nAltree, Mike Ashburn, John Gibbons, and Ed Richards were invaluable. \nAshley Disque--a young woman who came to the committee as an L.C. and \nhas not looked back--epitomized initiative. Mike Kennedy, an attorney \nwho is going to go places, in my opinion, worked around the clock. \nFinally, I want to commend Mike O'Neill, our crime counsel. Mike is \ngoing to be leaving here in a few weeks to clerk for Justice Thomas \nover at the Supreme Court. Our loss is the Supreme Court's gain. Quite \nsimply, Mike O'Neill, more than any other staffer, made this bill \nhappen. Manus Cooney, our committee staff director and senior counsel \nis also to be commended.\n  Some of Senator Biden's staff should be mentioned as well--Demetra \nLambros and Chris Putala are true professionals. Also, I would like to \nthank Valerie Flappan of the legislative counsel's office.\n  I also want to compliment the other House conferees and, in \nparticular, Congressmen Hyde, McCollum, Schiff, Buyer, and especially \nBob Barr from Georgia, who worked very hard on this bill and has \nprovided an awful lot of input on this bill. Another staffer who should \nbe mentioned here is Pat Murray, Henry Hyde's able and dedicated \ncounsel who, in working with our staff, helped craft a true terrorism \nbill. Paul McNulty also deserves credit. There are so many others I \nwould like to commend at this point. But I will end at this point and \nthank all of these good people for the good work they have done.\n  I pay respect to my distinguished colleague, the minority leader on \nthe Judiciary Committee. He is a tough, tough opponent. He is a very \ngood advocate. It is one of the privileges in my life to be able to \nwork with him on the Judiciary Committee and to be able to have this \ntype of a relationship, and still to occasionally fight each other on \nthe floor and, hopefully, walk away still friends.\n  In particular, I want to make all those congratulations.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/04/17/senate-section/article/S3454-1", "month": "04", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "17", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3478]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   APPOINTMENT BY THE VICE PRESIDENT\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, Senators often make statements on the floor \nto inform the Senate and the Nation about the accomplishments of their \nconstituents, and today I wish to acknowledge some folks back in \nIllinois who have achieved a historic feat unequaled by their peers. My \ncolleagues may be familiar with this group of Chicagoans. I am speaking \nof the Chicago Bulls, who last night defeated the Milwaukee Bucks in a \nhard-fought, 86 to 80 game, to become the first National Basketball \nAssociation [NBA] team to win 70 games in a season.\n  In the nearly 50-year history of the NBA, 70 wins has been a \nmythical, seemingly unattainable goal. The 1971-72 Los Angeles Lakers \ncame close with 69 wins, but now the Bulls have secured their place in \nthe history books with 70, and with 3 games left in the season, that \nrecord could be higher.\n  Of course this achievement would not have been possible without the \nreturn of Michael Jordan, unarguably the game's greatest player ever. \nBut we cannot overlook the efforts of his star teammates, from Scottie \nPippen, Toni Kukoc, and Dennis Rodman, to the less publicized but \ninvaluable players like Ron Harper, Luc Longley, Steve Kerr, and Bill \nWennington, to name just a few. The talent of individuals however can \nonly take you so far. A true champion needs a great leader, and coach \nPhil Jackson has fulfilled that role throughout his career, having \nguided the Bulls to three previous championships.\n  Should the Bulls go on to win the championship in June--their fourth \nof the decade--there is little doubt that they would be considered the \ngreatest team in the history of professional basketball. I am proud to \nrepresent this group of individuals and congratulate them on their \nunprecedented accomplishment. I wish them the best of luck as they head \ninto the playoffs.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/04/17/senate-section/article/S3478-3", "month": "04", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "17", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3478-S3479]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       CHICAGO BULLS WIN 70 GAMES\n\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. Mr. President, I want to take this opportunity to \ncommemorate a historic moment for the city of Chicago and the State of \nIllinois. Over the years, the members of this greatest deliberative \nbody have engaged in some of the most compelling debates the world has \never heard: issues of States' rights, war and peace, and individual \nliberty. But as of last evening, one debate need no longer be \nconsidered: which is the greatest NBA team of all time, at least \nthrough the regular season. By recording their unprecedented 70th win \nof the regular season, the 1995-96 Chicago Bulls are one of the best \nteams of all time, and when they go on to secure an NBA championship, \nthey will be without question, the greatest team in the history of \nprofessional basketball.\n  In the 49-year history of the National Basketball Association, no \nteam has won 70 games in one season until the Chicago Bulls \naccomplished that remarkable feat--I am sad to say to my dear friend \nand colleague from Wisconsin, Senator Kohl--by defeating the Milwaukee \nBucks last night 86 to 80. By winning their 70th game in 79 tries, the \nBulls eclipsed a 24-year-old record set by the Los Angeles Lakers and \nnow stand alone on the other side of what once was considered an \nimpregnable barrier.\n  This year's Bulls team has elevated itself to an elite level in the \nhistory of sports. This team deserves to be ranked on the same level as \nthe 1927 New York Yankees, the 1972 Miami Dolphins, and the 1977 \nMontreal Canadiens--all teams that embodied perfection in sports. It \nmight also be noted that with this 70th win, Chicago now holds the \ndistinguished honor of having or sharing three of the four major sports \nrecords for most wins in a regular season--the 1906 Cubs in baseball, \n116 wins, the 1985 Bears in football, 15 wins and now, the Chicago \nBulls. I know I speak for Bulls fans across the country in saying that \nwe are energized and excited by the zealous pursuit of victory \nexhibited by our team this year.\n\n  It is no coincidence that the greatest team of all time is being \npropelled by the greatest player of all time--Michael Jordan. Michael \nJordan has a combination of power and panache unmatched in the history \nof the NBA. He refuses to lose and his competitive nature, floor \nleadership, and will to win lifts the playing level of all those around \nhim.\n  Mr. President, we all know that in team sports, true greatness cannot \nbe achieved alone. Michael Jordan is surrounded by outstanding players \nin their own right--Scottie Pippen, Dennis Rodman, Toni Kukoc, and the \nrest of the lineup. Coach Phil Jackson has been able to skillfully mesh \nall the personalities of this team into an extraordinary combination of \nteamwork and individual achievement. The result is the 70-win \naccomplishment that has eluded basketball's best players and teams for \ndecades.\n\n[[Page S3479]]\n\n  On behalf of the city of Chicago and the State of Illinois, I want to \noffer my State's hearty congratulations to Coach Jackson and the entire \nBulls organization for winning 70 games in the 1995-96 regular season, \na record that may never be equaled.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/04/17/senate-section/article/S3478-4", "month": "04", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "17", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3479-S3480]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n CONGRATULATING NATIONAL PEOPLE'S ACTION ON 25 YEARS OF ACCOMPLISHMENT \n            AND THEIR 25TH NATIONAL NEIGHBORHOODS CONFERENCE\n\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. Mr. President, on Saturday, April 27, National \nPeople's Action (NPA), a national network of more than 300 community \norganizations, churches, and senior citizen groups from 38 States \nacross the country, will open its 25th national neighborhoods \nconference here in Washington, DC.\n  I want to call the Senate's attention to this conference, because \nNational People's Action represents America at its best--people from \nneighborhoods working together to improve their neighborhoods. The \nhundreds of organizations and the thousands of people from all walks of \nlife who make up National People's Action are committed to their \ncommunities. They know that neighborhoods are critically important. \nThey know that neighborhoods with good housing, neighborhoods that are \nsafe, and neighborhoods with access to good jobs are places where \nfamilies can achieve their own piece of the American dream. And perhaps \nmost importantly, they know that by putting fundamental American values \nto work--by working hard to make those values an everyday part of life \nin their neighborhoods--they are making a real difference in their \ncommunities and in our country.\n  National People's Action is known as the first voice of our Nation's \nneighborhoods. This people's organization has, from its inception, \nspoken out for investing in neighborhoods, ending redlining by \nfinancial institutions, expanding the stock of good, affordable \nhousing, implementing community-based approaches to crime prevention \nand policing, and expanding economic opportunity and the access to good \njobs at good wages that are so essential to healthy communities.\n  NPA is a grass roots movement with an enviable record of \naccomplishment. I would like to take just a moment to highlight a few \nof those many successes. First, NPA played a key role in making the \nCommunity Reinvestment Act, the primary Federal tool for expanding \naccess to capital, a reality, and NPA has used that tool to obtain over \n$25 billion worth of CRA lending agreements. These agreements mean \naccess to mortgage money, home rehabilitation money, and economic \ndevelopment money for hard-working people living in hard-pressed \nneighborhoods that have all too often been cut off from capital in the \npast.\n  NPA created the lease-to-purchase mortgage product, the first of its \nkind in the United States. This innovative approach allows people who \nmay not have the money to make a downpayment on a home to have a real \nopportunity to achieve perhaps the single most important element of the \nAmerican dream--owning their own home.\n  And NPA, working with Freddie Mac, created an ingenious new type of \nmortgage for buildings with two-to-four units, thereby helping to \nrevitalize this kind of housing, which is so important to so many \ncities and neighborhoods, and making it possible for neighborhood \nresidents to become homeowners and landlords. The result of this \nresourceful approach are more home-owners in neighborhoods, and a \nbetter stock of rental housing.\n  While NPA's successes are varied, however, they all have the same \ntheme. They are all about people, about making it possible for people \nin the neighborhoods and communities around our Nation to build a \nbetter life for themselves. NPA is a quintessentially American \norganization. It accomplishes a huge amount with very little money. It \nis nonbureaucratic. And it works right at the neighborhood level. It \ndoesn't tell people what to do. Rather, it brings people together so \nthat, by working together, they can make their neighborhoods better \nplaces to live for themselves and for their families.\n  National People's Action, and its national chairperson Gale Cincotta, \ndeserve the Senate's commendation. As I stated at the beginning of my \nremarks, this organization embodies the essence of American values. NPA \nputs the values on which this Nation was founded to work for all of its \npeople. I am therefore glad to have the opportunity to bring NPA's 25th \nannual neighborhoods conference to the Senate's attention, and I hope \nevery Member of the Senate will attend this important event.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a complete list of NPA's \nmajor proneighborhood accomplishments be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the list was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                      NPA's Major Accomplishments\n\n\n                              reinvestment\n\n       Spearheaded enactment of the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act \n     (HMDA) and the Community Reinvestment Act (CRA) which protect \n     urban areas and minorities from loan discrimination.\n       Provided technical assistance to community groups which \n     directly led to over $25 billion in NPA assisted CRA lending \n     agreements.\n       Developed 10 city pilot affordable housing programs with \n     the secondary market and private mortgage insurers which led \n     to a nationwide low-downpayment program called the Community \n     Homebuyers Program. The development of the CHBP has resulted \n     in industry-wide changes in the standards for conventional \n     lending and millions of home loans to low income families.\n       Coordinated the Chicago Reinvestment Alliance, which in \n     1984 developed a $363 million Neighborhood Lending Program. \n     The program has been renewed twice, and to date, over $500 \n     million have been lent and over 14,000 units of affordable \n     housing and businesses have been created or rehabilitated in \n     Chicago.\n       Coordinated the NPA/Aetna Neighborhood Investment Program, \n     which provided over $100 million in loans for rehabilitation \n     or construction of over 10,000 affordable housing units in 14 \n     urban neighborhoods throughout the country.\n       Brought the Neighborhood Housing Services (NHS) to Chicago \n     and has continued to support its expansion by developing new \n     loan programs and funding sources.\n       Successfully advocated for increases in Community \n     Development Block Grant (CDBG) funding and for increases in \n     the targeting of CDBG funds to low and moderate income \n     neighborhoods.\n       Created the Lease-to-Purchase mortgage product, the first-\n     of-its-kind in the nation. This product allows individuals to \n     enter the home as tenants and after a 2-3 year lease period \n     become the homeowner, having accumulated a 10-15% downpayment \n     to purchase. Lease-to-Purchase has become a standard \n     affordable housing option.\n       Successfully advocated for performance oriented goals for \n     Government Sponsored Enterprises (GSEs) requiring 30% of \n     mortgages to be purchased in underserved markets and from low \n     and moderate income families.\n       Created a unique low downpayment mortgage product for 2-4 \n     unit buildings with Freddie Mac that allows for 75% of rental \n     income to be used to qualify the applicant, thus creating an \n     opportunity for homeownership for low income people.\n       Developed in conjunction with the Mortgage Guaranty \n     Insurance Corporation (MGIC) the first ever purchase and \n     default counseling training for community based counselors.\n\n\n                     federl housing administration\n\n       Through a national advocacy campaign, stopped abusive \n     lending practices that resulted in catastrophic FHA \n     foreclosures in the 1970s.\n       Secured 518(b) and (d) Payback Programs for buyers of \n     defective FHA homes which provided funds for repair of major \n     systems and structural defects.\n       Developed Repair and Sell Programs that rehabilitated \n     vacant FHA homes in blighted neighborhoods.\n       Spearheaded the development of the FHA Assignment Program \n     which provides assistance to those behind in their mortgage \n     in order to prevent foreclosure.\n       Continued to research FHA lending practices and uncover \n     abuses, such as illegal minimum loan amounts imposed by some \n     FHA lenders.\n       Negotiated a HUD demonstration program that allows not-for-\n     profit developers to obtain vacant, foreclosed properties at \n     a 30% discount. Over 600 homes have been rehabilitated for \n     low income families. This pilot program has become a \n     permanent HUD program.\n       Successfully advocated for public disclosure by HUD of FHA \n     lending activity and loan failure rates by mortgage company \n     and census tract.

OF 1995\n\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nfollowing items with regard to S. 1028 be included in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                             Cost Estimate\n\n                                                    U.S. Congress,\n\n\n                                  Congressional Budget Office,\n\n                               Washington, DC, September 22, 1995.\n     Hon. Nancy Landon Kassebaum,\n     Chairman, Committee on Labor and Human Resources, U.S. \n         Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Madam Chairman: The Congressional Budget Office [CBO] \n     has reviewed S. 1028, the Health Insurance Reform Act of \n     1995, as ordered reported by the Senate Committee on Labor \n     and Human Resources on August 2, 1995. CBO estimates that \n     enactment of S. 1028 would not significantly affect the \n     federal budget. (Each state's insurance commissioner would \n     ensure that the requirements of this legislation are carried \n     out by health insurance carriers in their state; CBO has not \n     attempted to estimate the amount by which state government \n     spending could be changed.) Pay-as-you-go procedures would \n     apply because the bill could affect direct spending and \n     receipts. the estimated change in direct spending and \n     receipts, however, is not significant.\n       This bill would create uniform national standards intended \n     to improve the portability of private health insurance \n     policies. for example, these standards would allow workers \n     with employment-based policies to continue their coverage \n     more easily when changing or leaving jobs. Because most \n     private insurance plans require a waiting period before new \n     enrollees become eligible for coverage, especially for \n     preexisting medical conditions, workers with chronic \n     conditions or other health risks may face gaps in their \n     coverage when they change jobs. Alternatively, such workers \n     may be hesitant to change jobs because they fear the \n     temporary loss of coverage, a situation known as ``job-\n     lock.''\n       S. 1028 would reduce the effective length of exclusions for \n     preexisting conditions by crediting enrollees for continuous \n     coverage by a previous insurer. Insurance companies would be \n     prohibited from denying certain coverage based on the medical \n     status or experience of individuals or groups and would be \n     required to renew coverage in most cases. Insurers could not \n     deny coverage to individuals who have exhausted their \n     continuing coverage from a previous employer. This bill \n     would allow individuals to change their enrollment status \n     without being subject to penalties for late enrollment if \n     their family or employment status changes during the year. \n     To the extent that states have not already implemented \n     similar rules, these changes would clarify the insurance \n     situation and possibly reduce gaps in coverage for many \n     people.\\1\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n     Footnotes at end of letter.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n       Because the bill would not regulate the premiums that plans \n     could charge, the net number of people covered by health \n     insurance and the premiums that they pay would continue to be \n     influenced primarily by current market forces. In other \n     words, although insurance would become more portable for some \n     people under this bill, it would not become any more or less \n     available in general.\n       S. 1028 could affect the federal budget in two primary \n     ways. First, if the bill changed the amount of employer-paid \n     health premiums, total federal tax revenues could change. For \n     example, if the amount employers paid for premiums rose, cash \n     wages would probably fall, thereby reducing income and \n     payroll tax revenues. If individuals paid more for \n     individually-purchased insurance, they could increase their \n     itemized deductions for health expenses. Second, if the bill \n     caused people insured by Medicaid or government health \n     programs to purchase private coverage, then federal outlays \n     for those programs could change.\n       According to the General Accounting Office [GAO], 38 states \n     have enacted legislation to improve the portability and \n     renewability of health plans among small employers.\\2\\ The \n     state laws do not apply to employees of larger firms with \n     self-funded insurance plans, however, and the GAO report \n     finds that state laws generally do not apply to the market \n     for individually-purchased insurance.\n       Because many insurance reforms have already been \n     implemented by the states, GAO assumes that the new national \n     standards created by S. 1028 would not significantly change \n     the insurance market for most people. Although the national \n     standards created by S. 1028 would improve the portability of \n     health insurance for some additional groups or individuals, \n     GAO assumes that the incremental change in the insurance \n     marketplace would be minor. Any changes to overall insurance \n     coverage or premiums caused by the bill would probably be \n     small, and the direction of the change is uncertain. Most \n     people subject to the new insurance rules would have had \n     coverage under the old rules, so their total health spending \n     would probably not be noticeably different. Therefore federal \n     revenues would be unlikely to change.\\3\\\n       CBO estimates that federal outlays for Medicaid would not \n     change because any persons eligible for free coverage from \n     Medicaid under current law would also seek out Medicaid \n     coverage if S. 1028 was enacted. CBO also estimates that the \n     bill would cause no appreciable changes to federal outlays \n     for Medicare, Federal Employees Health Benefits, or other \n     federal programs.\n       If you wish further details on this estimate, we will be \n     pleased to provide them. The CBO staff contact is Jeff \n     Lemieux.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                     James L. Blum\n                                  (For June E. O'Neill, Director).\n\n\n                               Footnotes\n\n     \\1\\ For additional discussion, see GAO testimony ``Health \n     Insurance Regulations, National Portability Standards Would \n     Facilitate Changing Health Plans,'' July 18, 1995, before the \n     Senate Committee on Labor and Human Resources.\n     \\2\\ Health Insurance Regulation: Variation in Recent State \n     Small Employer Health Insurance Reforms (GSO/HEHS-95-161FS, \n     June 12, 1995).\n     \\3\\ CBO cooperates with the Joint Committee on Taxation to \n     produce estimates of revenue changes under proposals that \n     would change the private health insurance market. Following \n     CBO's estimate that S. 1028 would not significantly change \n     spending for private health insurance, the Joint Committee \n     assumes that federal revenues would not change.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                                    U.S. Congress,\n\n\n                                  Congressional Budget Office,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, March 22, 1996.\n     Hon.

The cost of the \n     intergovernmental mandates would not exceed the applicable \n     $50 million threshold, but the costs of the private sector \n     mandates would exceed the applicable $100 million threshold.\n       If you wish further details on this estimate, we will be \n     pleased to provide them.\n           Sincerely,\n                                        June E. O'Neill, Director.\n       Enclosure.\n\n    Congressional Budget Office Estimated Cost of Intergovernmental \n                                Mandates\n\n       1. Bill number: S. 1028.\n       2. Bill title: The Health Insurance Reform Act of 1995.\n       3. Bill status: As reported by the Senate Committee on \n     Labor and Human Resources on October 12, 1995.\n       4. Bill purpose: S. 1028 would make it easier for people \n     who change jobs to maintain adequate coverage by requiring \n     issuers of group health plans and sponsors of health plans \n     for employees to: Limit exclusions for preexisting conditions \n     to 12 months (18 months for late enrollees) with a one-for-\n     one offset against the exclusion for continuous coverage; not \n     impose eligibility requirements based on health status or \n     other medical information; and offer special enrollment \n     periods when an employee experiences a change in family \n     composition (e.g., the birth of a child) or a family member \n     of an employee loses health coverage under another health \n     plan because of a change in employment status.\n       In addition, the bill would require health plans sponsored \n     by employers to: extend COBRA coverage an additional 11 \n     months if an employee becomes disabled during the 18 months \n     of the original COBRA coverage or has disabled dependents, \n     and provide immediate coverage to newborns or adopted \n     children under a parent's COBRA policy.\n       Furthermore, S. 1028 would increase the portability of \n     health insurance from group coverage to individual coverage \n     by requiring issuers of individual health insurance to \n     provide coverage if an individual has had 18 months of \n     continuous coverage. In addition, the bill would assist \n     employers and individuals in establishing voluntary \n     coalitions for purchasing group health insurance and preempt \n     some state laws dealing with purchasing cooperatives. \n     Finally, if the bill is enacted, states would have the option \n     of enforcing the bill's requirements regarding group and \n     individual health insurance. If a state chooses not to \n     enforce the requirements, the federal government would \n     enforce them.\n       5. Intergovernmental mandates contained in bill: S. 1028 \n     contains several intergovernmental mandates as defined in \n     Public Law 104-4, primarily the new requirements that would \n     be imposed on health plans sponsored by employers. State and \n     local governments who offer their employees health insurance \n     would have to abide by these requirements.\n       6. Estimated direct costs to State, local, and tribal \n     governments:\n       (a) Is the $50 Million a Year Threshold Exceeded? No.\n       (b) Total Direct Costs of Mandates: S. 1028 would increase \n     the cost of health insurance for covered employees of state \n     and local governments, but this cost would primarily be borne \n     by the employees themselves and not by state or local \n     taxpayers. Although CBO cannot provide a precise estimate, \n     any increase in the cost of health insurance for employees of \n     state and local governments would amount to less than $50 \n     million annually. As a result of higher health care costs, \n     state and local governments would reduce other elements of \n     their employees' compensation packages by a corresponding \n     amount. The amount of total compensation paid by the state \n     and local governments would thus remain unchanged in the long \n     run. Except for an initial transition period, during which \n     state and local governments may not be able to change other \n     elements of their employees' compensation packages, state and \n     local governments would not be required to spend additional \n     funds to comply with these mandates.\n       (c) Estimate of Necessary Budget Authority: None.\n       7. Basis of estimate: Based on a limited survey of State \n     and local governments, CBO found that the health insurance \n     plans currently offered by State and local governments are \n     generally in compliance with S. 1028. However, some State and \n     local governments would have to make minor adjustments to \n     their plans. Almost all plans already limit to 1 year, or do \n     not include, exclusions for preexisting conditions, but only \n     a few of the plans that have exclusions allow an offset \n     against the exclusion for continuous coverage. In addition, \n     some plans do not offer special enrollment periods when a \n     family member of a participant loses his or her health \n     insurance under another plan because of a change in \n     employment. Finally, the expansion of COBRA coverage would \n     affect all plans.\n       CBO estimates that the cost of S. 1028 to the private \n     sector for the group health insurance reforms would total \n     about $300 million. A simple calculation, based on the number \n     of employees involved, would indicate that the cost of S. \n     1028 for employees of State and local governments would be \n     $60 million. CBO believes that the cost would actually be \n     significantly less than this, however, because health plans \n     sponsored by State and local governments are generally more \n     liberal than plans sponsored by private sector employers. \n     State and local governments therefore would be confronted \n     with fewer changes as a result of S. 1028. The cost of the \n     mandates imposed on State and local government would clearly \n     be less than $50 million, a change of about 0.1 percent in \n     the approximately $40 billion that is now spent on health \n     insurance for employees of State and local governments.\n       Economists generally believe, and CBO's cost estimates have \n     long assumed, that workers as a group bear most of the cost \n     of employers' health insurance premiums. The primary reason \n     for this conclusion is that the supply of labor is relatively \n     insensitive to changes in take-home wages. Because most \n     workers continue to work even if their take-home pay \n     declines, employers have little trouble shifting most of the \n     cost of additional health insurance to workers' wages or \n     other fringe benefits.\n       8. Appropriation or other Federal financial assistance \n     provided in bill to cover mandate costs: None.\n       9. Other impacts on State, local and tribal governments: \n     States would have the option of enforcing the requirements of \n     S. 1028 on issuers of health insurance in the group and \n     individual markets. If a State decides not to enforce the new \n     requirements, the Federal Government would do so. Because \n     enforcement would be voluntary, this provision would not \n     impose an intergovernmental mandate as defined in Public Law \n     104-4. However, the enforcement provisions would have a \n     budgetary impact on State governments. States currently \n     regulate the group and individual markets, and CBO does not \n     expect any State to give up this authority and \n     responsibility. States thus would incur additional costs as \n     they enforce the new requirements. In 1995, according to the \n     National Association of Insurance Commissioners, States spent \n     $650 million regulating all forms of insurance (health and \n     others). CBO expects that S. 1028 would increase these costs \n     only marginally.\n       10. Previous CBO estimate: None.\n       11. Estimate prepared by: John Patterson.\n       12. Estimate approved by: Paul N. Van de Water, Assistant \n     Director for Budget Analysis.\n\n    Congressional Budget Office Estimate of Costs of Private Sector \n                                Mandates\n\n       1. Bill number: S. 1028.\n       2. Bill title: Health Insurance Reform Act of 1995.\n       3. Bill status: As reported by the Senate Committee on \n     Labor and Human Resources on October 12, 1995.\n       4. Bill purpose: The purpose of S. 1028 is to increase \n     access to health care benefits for workers and their families \n     both while the workers are employed and after they leave \n     employment. It would also increase the portability of health \n     insurance when workers change jobs, and make other changes \n     affecting health care benefits.\n       5. Private sector mandates contained in the bill: S. 1028 \n     contains several private sector mandates as defined in P.L. \n     104-4 that would affect the private health insurance \n     industry. Three general areas of coverage would be affected: \n     (1) the group and employer-sponsored health insurance market, \n     (2) the extensions of health insurance required under the \n     Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act (COBRA) of \n     1985, and (3) the market for individual health insurance.\n     Mandates on group insurers and employee health benefit plans\n       The bill would require sellers of group health insurance to \n     cover any group purchaser who applies. Group insurers could \n     stop selling coverage only under certain conditions, such as \n     ceasing to offer coverage to any additional group purchasers. \n     Under those circumstances, they could resume offering \n     coverage only after a 6 month cessation and would be required \n     to resume on a first-come-first-served basis. Those \n     availability provisions would apply separately to the ``large \n     group'' and ``small group'' markets--that is, an issuer would \n     be allowed to serve only one of those markets. Group insurers \n     would also be required to renew coverage at the option of the \n     group purchaser, except in certain circumstances including \n     nonpayment of premiums, or fraud or misrepresentation on the \n     part of the group purchaser. Network plans would not be \n     required to renew coverage to people living outside the \n     geographic area covered by the plan as long as this action is \n     done on a uniform basis, without regard to the health \n     status of particular individuals.\n\n[[Page S3482]]\n\n       Several provisions of the bill would apply both to sellers \n     of group insurance and to employee health benefit plans that \n     are ``self-insured'' by firms. Eligibility, enrollment, and \n     requirements relating to premium contributions could not be \n     based on the employee's health status, claims experience, or \n     medical history.\n       In addition, the bill would limit the use of pre-existing \n     condition exclusions--clauses that exempt the plan from \n     paying for expenses related to a medical condition that \n     already existed when an enrollee first joined the plan. Under \n     the bill, twelve months would be the maximum allowable \n     duration of a pre-existing condition exclusion (eighteen \n     months for employees who did not join the plan at their first \n     enrollment opportunity). Furthermore, month-for-month credit \n     against that exclusion would have to be given to enrollees \n     for continuous coverage that they had prior to joining a new \n     plan. (Insurers and health benefit plans would be required to \n     keep records to document the previous coverage.) In addition, \n     pregnancy could not be excluded by a pre-existing condition \n     clause, and children who were signed up with a plan within \n     thirty days of birth could not have any existing conditions \n     excluded from coverage. (A similar provision applies for \n     adopted children.)\n       Affiliation periods, in which new enrollees pay no premium \n     but receive no benefits, could be used if pre-existing \n     condition exclusions were not part of the plan. However, such \n     periods would be limited to sixty days (ninety days for late \n     enrollees).\n       Finally, the bill would require that health plans offer \n     special enrollment periods for participants or family members \n     for various changes in family or employment status.\n     Mandates extending COBRA continuation coverage\n       Under certain circumstances, the bill would compel firms to \n     extend so-called ``COBRA'' coverage to former employees or \n     their family members for a longer period of time than is \n     currently required. Under current law, firms that offer \n     health insurance as part of their employee benefits package \n     and employ 20 or more people must allow employees (and family \n     members) to continue coverage for 18 months after leaving \n     employment (or for certain other reasons), at a cost that \n     cannot exceed 102 percent of the premium for regular \n     employees. Under certain circumstances, such as if a worker \n     is disabled when he or she first qualifies for COBRA \n     coverage, an additional 11-month extension of coverage also \n     must be made available.\n       The bill would extend COBRA coverage by specifying an \n     additional condition that would qualify former employees (or \n     their insured family members) for the 11-month extension \n     period after the initial 18-month period. In particular, if a \n     former employee were to become disabled during the first 18 \n     months of extended coverage, then they would qualify for \n     the additional 11-month period. Disability of an insured \n     family member also would be a qualifying condition for \n     continuation of CORBA coverage. Under the current law \n     COBRA provisions, a premium of 150 percent of the premium \n     for regular employees could be charged to former employees \n     in the additional 11-month period.\n     Mandates affecting the individual insurance market\n       Under S. 1028, sellers of individual health insurance \n     policies would be required to cover individuals who wanted to \n     enroll in an individual health plan, regardless of their \n     medical history or claims experience, if they had at least 18 \n     months of continuous prior coverage by one or more group \n     health plans or employee health benefit plans. To be eligible \n     for such group-to-individual market ``portability,'' the \n     individual applicant also would have to be ineligible for \n     coverage by another group health plan, employee health \n     benefit plan, or COBRA continuation coverage. The bill would \n     leave the determination of premiums to the applicable state \n     laws or regulations.\n       Issuers of individual plans also would be required to renew \n     policies at the option of the insured individuals, except for \n     certain circumstances including nonpayment of premiums or \n     fraud.\n       To the extent that state laws or regulations were a \n     suitable substitute for the provisions of the bill, the \n     federal rules would not apply. Examples of such substitutes \n     could include laws providing for state-sponsored high-risk \n     pools that provide coverage to those who could not otherwise \n     obtain private coverage, open enrollment by one or more \n     health plan issuers to facilitate coverage in the individual \n     market, and guaranteed issue of insurance to all individuals \n     regardless of their health status.\n       6. Estimated direct cost to the private sector: CBO \n     estimates that the direct cost of the main private sector \n     mandates in S. 1028 would be approximately $350 million in \n     the first year the provisions were effective, rising to about \n     $500 million annually in the fifth year. Those mandate costs \n     represent about one-quarter of one percent of total private \n     sector health insurance expenditures, although their \n     distribution among health insurance plans would be uneven. \n     (Plans that cover public sector employees are not included in \n     this analysis.) These estimates are subject to considerable \n     uncertainty because a number of underlying assumptions rely \n     on limited data or judgments about future changes in health \n     insurance markets.\n       The specific mandates examined in this estimate are: \n     Limiting the length of time employer-sponsored and group \n     insurance plans could withhold coverage for pre-existing \n     conditions; requiring that periods of continuous prior health \n     plan coverage be credited against pre-existing condition \n     exclusions of a new plan; extending the conditions under \n     which an employer would have to offer 11 additional months of \n     COBRA coverage for disabled people; and requiring issuers of \n     individual health insurance policies to offer coverage to all \n     individuals who meet specific requirements, including 18 \n     months of prior continuous group of employer-sponsored \n     coverage.\n       Basis of the estimate: The direct costs of those mandates \n     consist of the additional health expenses that would be \n     covered by insurance as a direct result of their \n     implementation. Expenses for pre-existing conditions that \n     would have to be paid by insurers under the bill but would \n     not have been insured under current law, for example, are \n     included in aggregate direct costs. In contrast, insured \n     expenses that would be transferred among different insurers \n     because of the bill are not included in aggregate direct \n     costs.\n       In making this estimate, CBO did not attempt to value any \n     social benefits that might result from expansions in \n     insurance coverage. That is, the estimate accounts only for \n     the additional insurance costs of the mandates, not the value \n     of additional insurance coverage to beneficiaries. Nor was \n     there an attempt to quantify any indirect costs or benefits. \n     Such indirect effects could include, for example, loss of \n     coverage if an employer ceases to offer group coverage when \n     premiums rise, or increases in worker mobility (or reduced \n     ``job lock'') with greater portability of benefits. It would \n     be important to weigh all such factors in considering the \n     bill, but only estimates of the direct costs of the mandates \n     in the bill are required by P.L. 104-4, the Unfunded Mandates \n     Reform Act.\n     Direct costs of mandates on group insurers and employee \n         health benefit plans\n       Two of the principal mandates in S. 1028 affect group and \n     employee health benefit plans: (1) limiting the maximum \n     length of pre-existing condition exclusions, and (2) \n     requiring that health plans reduce the length of pre-existing \n     condition exclusions for people with prior continuous \n     coverage under other health plans. CBO estimates that the \n     direct cost of those two mandates would total about $300 \n     million in each of the first five years the provisions would \n     be effective. This cost is approximately 0.2 percent of \n     the total premium payments in the group and employer-\n     sponsored market.\n       Limiting the Maximum Length of an Exclusion. The mandate to \n     limit exclusions for pre-existing conditions to 12 months (18 \n     months for late enrollees) is estimated to have a direct \n     private-sector cost of about $200 million per year. This \n     estimate is based on two components: (1) the number of people \n     who would have more of their medical expenses covered by \n     insurance if exclusions were limited to one year or less, and \n     (2) the average cost to insurers of that newly insured \n     medical care.\n       CBO used data from the Survey of Employee Benefits in the \n     April 1993 Current Population Survey (CPS) to estimate the \n     number of people with conditions that are not now covered \n     because of a pre-existing condition exclusion of more than \n     one year. The survey asks respondents whether they or a \n     family member have a medical condition that their employment-\n     based plan is not covering because of a pre-existing \n     condition exclusion. It also asks respondents how long they \n     have been with their present firm. For people with medical \n     conditions excluded by a pre-existing condition clause, \n     responses to the second question are used to estimate whether \n     the exclusion period exceeds one year.\n       A number of adjustments were made to the data. In \n     particular, CBO's estimate of the number of people affected \n     by S. 1028 excluded people who said they were limited by a \n     pre-existing restriction but who also had other health \n     insurance coverage, because the other insurance plan might \n     have covered their pre-existing conditions. Under those \n     circumstances, the limitation imposed on employment-based \n     plans by S. 1028 would not raise their aggregate costs.\n       The second modification to the CPS data adjusted for \n     changes in the insurance market that have occurred since the \n     survey date of 1993. In particular, since that time, about 40 \n     states have implemented laws affecting the small group \n     insurance market that would limit pre-existing condition \n     exclusions to one year or less and require that previous \n     coverage be credited against those exclusions. Those laws \n     generally apply to groups of 50 or fewer employees and do not \n     include self-funded health benefit plans. Because plans \n     covered by such state laws would not have to change their \n     provisions as a result of S. 1028, CBO lowered its initial \n     estimate of the number of people affected by the bill.\n       CBO's analysis led to the conclusion that approximately \n     300,000 people would gain coverage under S. 1028 for some \n     condition that would otherwise be excluded by a long (more \n     than one year) pre-existing condition clause. This estimate \n     represents less than 0.3 percent of people with private \n     employment-based coverage.\n       The other component of the estimated private-sector cost is \n     the average cost of the coverage that would become available \n     under S. 1028. A recent monograph from the American Academy \n     of Actuaries (referred to as the Academy) indicated a surge \n     in claims costs of 40 to 60 percent when a pre-existing\n\n[[Page S3483]]\n\n     condition exclusion period expired for a sample of people \n     with high expected medical costs.\\1\\ That range is consistent \n     with information from Spencer and Associates indicating that \n     the costs of policies for former employees who have chosen to \n     take extended COBRA coverage are 55 percent higher than those \n     of active employees.\\2\\ Applying those percentages to the \n     average premium cost in the employer-sponsored market yields \n     a potential range of additional costs of $600 to $900 a year \n     per person who would gain coverage under S. 1028.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n     Footnotes at end of article.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n       Crediting Prior Coverage Against Current Exclusions. \n     Another provision in S. 1028 would require insurers under \n     certain circumstances to credit previous continuous health \n     insurance coverage against pre-existing condition periods. \n     That provision is estimated to have a private sector cost of \n     about $100 million per year. The key components of this \n     estimate are: (1) the number of people who would receive some \n     added coverage, and (2) the additional full-year cost of \n     coverage, adjusted to reflect the estimated number of months \n     of that coverage.\n       CPS data were used to estimate the number of people who \n     would receive some added coverage under this mandate. These \n     are people who would otherwise face some denial of coverage \n     under a pre-existing condition exclusion period of one year \n     or less, and who would qualify for a shortened exclusion \n     period based on prior continuous coverage. CBO estimates that \n     about 100,000 people would receive some added coverage under \n     this provision of the bill. The relatively small size of this \n     estimate is due largely to the difficulty of meeting the \n     restrictive eligibility criteria for the reduction in the \n     exclusion period--particularly the requirement that at most a \n     30-day gap separate prior periods of insurance coverage from \n     enrollment in the new plan.\n       The average number of months of coverage these people would \n     gain is constrained by the one-year limit on the exclusion \n     period that would be required under the bill. Based on \n     information from a 1995 study by KPMG Peat Marwick, CBO \n     estimates that people who would qualify would gain coverage \n     for an average of 10 months.\\3\\ CBO's estimate of the \n     additional insured costs per person is based on evidence \n     from the Academy, which suggested that people with pre-\n     existing condition exclusions may not seek treatment \n     during the exclusion period but have rapid increases in \n     expenses when that period expires. That behavior would \n     reduce the effectiveness of exclusion periods in \n     protecting insurers from treatment costs. The shorter the \n     exclusion period, the less effective the pre-existing \n     exclusion is at reducing the insurer's costs. CBO \n     consequently assumed that full-year insured costs of \n     people getting coverage for pre-existing conditions under \n     this provision would rise by less than 40 percent.\n       Other Considerations. The estimated direct cost of the \n     mandate to limit the length of pre-existing condition \n     exclusions is about $200 million annually, and the cost of \n     the mandate to credit previous coverage against pre-existing \n     condition exclusions is about $100 million. Together, those \n     mandate costs amount to about 0.2 percent of total premium \n     payments in the group and employer-sponsored market.\n       Those estimates are subject to considerable uncertainty for \n     several reasons. First, they are based on individuals' \n     responses to surveys, which should be treated with caution. \n     In addition, unforeseen changes in health insurance markets \n     could result in the estimates being too low or too high. \n     Larger than expected increases in medical costs would result \n     in higher direct costs than estimated. On the other hand, the \n     growth of managed care plans would lower the direct costs of \n     the bill. The magnitude of this effect would depend on the \n     relative growth of HMOs, which generally do not use \n     preexisting condition exclusions, as compared to PPO and POS \n     plans, many of which do use preexisting condition exclusions.\n       The distribution of the direct costs of the mandates would \n     be uneven across health plans. Only plans that currently use \n     pre-existing condition exclusions of more than 12 months \n     would face the $200 million direct cost of the first mandate. \n     Data from the Peat Marwick survey indicate that 2.5 percent \n     of employees are in such health plans. Consequently, the \n     costs to health plans that use long pre-existing condition \n     exclusions would be about 4.5 percent of their premium costs. \n     Likewise, only health plans that use pre-existing condition \n     exclusions would face the direct cost of the mandate to \n     credit previous coverage against the pre-existing exclusion. \n     The data indicate that almost half of employees are in such \n     plans--implying that the plans directly affected by this \n     mandate would have direct costs equal to about one-tenth of \n     one percent of their premiums under current law.\n       Employers could respond in a number of ways to the \n     additional insured costs that would arise under these \n     provisions of the bill. They could reduce other insurance \n     benefits, increase employees' premium contributions, or \n     reduce other components of employee compensation. Employers \n     would be likely to respond in different ways, and these \n     changes could take time. Some employers that currently offer \n     health insurance to their employees might drop that coverage \n     if the costs became too large, although the magnitude of \n     such a reaction would probably be modest. These employer \n     responses, which would offset the costs of the mandates, \n     are indirect effects and do not enter into our estimates \n     of the direct costs to the private sector of the insurance \n     mandates.\n     Direct costs of mandates extending COBRA continuation \n         coverage for the disabled\n       CBO estimates that the aggregate direct costs of the COBRA \n     extension for disabled people would be negligible. Although \n     individuals qualifying for the extension would be expected to \n     have covered health expenses about three times greater than \n     their premium payments, very few people would actually \n     participate.\n       CBO used two approaches to estimate the number of people \n     who would take advantage of the new COBRA extension. The \n     first method used evidence on the number of employees \n     electing COBRA coverage under current law who are disabled. A \n     study by Flynn found that only 0.09 percent of COBRA \n     elections are by disabled people.\\4\\ Even under the \n     assumption that the number of disabled people having COBRA \n     coverage would double as a result of the new extension, fewer \n     than 5,000 people a year would be covered by that extension.\n       In the second approach, CBO used data from the 1992 Survey \n     of Income and Program Participation (SIPP) to examine the \n     prior insurance status of people who became covered under \n     Medicare disability coverage. That analysis also suggested \n     that the number of people qualifying for the additional COBRA \n     coverage under S. 1028 would be extremely small.\n       The costs of coverage for disabled people were estimated \n     using information from the 1987 National Medical Expenditure \n     Survey, which indicated that non-elderly disabled people had \n     medical expenditures four to five times greater than non-\n     disabled people. Those higher costs would be partly offset by \n     additional premiums that would be collected from persons \n     using the COBRA extension. COBRA allows insurers to charge \n     those people up to 150 percent of the premium for regular \n     employees. Consequently, assuming the full COBRA premium was \n     assessed, the insured costs of disabled people taking the new \n     extension would be about three times higher than the premiums \n     they would pay.\n     Direct costs of mandates affecting the individual insurance \n         market\n       S. 1028 would require issuers of individual health \n     insurance policies to offer coverage to all people who have \n     had group or employer-sponsored coverage continuously for at \n     least 18 months immediately prior to enrolling, but who are \n     not eligible for additional COBRA or other group coverage. \n     CBO estimates that this group-to-individual portability \n     provision would impose aggregate direct costs on the private \n     sector of less than $50 million in the first year the law was \n     effective. Those aggregate direct costs would rise to about \n     $200 million annually in the fifth year.\n       The mandate costs are added insurance costs of people who \n     would gain coverage minus premium payments that the newly \n     covered individuals themselves would make to insurers. \n     Premium payments are subtracted because they would directly \n     offset part of the cost of the mandate imposed on insurers.\n       A key element of this estimate is the calculation of the \n     number of people who would both qualify for and desire to \n     purchase individual market insurance under the provisions in \n     S. 1028, but who would not be extended insurance coverage \n     under current law. CBO analyzed data from the 1992 SIPP to \n     determine the number of people who: (1) had 18 months of \n     prior continuous group coverage, and (2) would purchase an \n     individual policy if insurers were not permitted to exclude \n     them on the basis of health. We assumed that uninsured survey \n     respondents who indicated that they were too sick to obtain \n     insurance would fulfill the latter condition. The data \n     suggest, however, that only about 25 percent of such people \n     would meet S. 1028's requirement of 18 months of continuous \n     prior group coverage.\n       Because the SIPP survey used in this analysis ended in late \n     1993, we made two additional adjustments to our estimate. \n     First, we corrected for changes in the number of uninsured \n     since 1993. Second, we reduced our estimate to account for \n     state legislation that supersedes the S. 1028 provision. Many \n     states undertook reforms of their individual insurance \n     markets prior to the time of the survey, and a few additional \n     states have implemented such laws since then. We assumed that \n     all states with comparable laws would get waivers from the S. \n     1028 provisions affecting the individual market. Accordingly, \n     the estimate assumes that the mandate would only be effective \n     in states accounting for about 5.4 million of the estimated \n     13.4 million people currently having individual coverage.\\5\\ \n     (Note that estimates of the number of people insured through \n     the individual market vary considerably. CBO's assumption is \n     consistent with that of the Academy.)\n       CBO concludes that approximately 40,000 people would become \n     covered by the end of the first year the bill would be \n     effective because of the group-to-individual portability \n     provision. The number of covered people would grow gradually \n     over time as more people who, in the absence of S. 1028, \n     would have been denied coverage because of poor health \n     would meet the 18-month continuous group coverage \n     requirement and choose to purchase individual insurance. \n     In about four years, the number of people covered because \n     of those portability provisions would plateau\n\n[[Page S3484]]\n\n     at around 150,000 people. Those estimates refer only to \n     the number of people who gain insurance coverage as a \n     result of S. 1028. The estimates do not include people who \n     might decide to move into individual insurance coverage \n     under S. 1028 but would have had insurance coverage from \n     elsewhere in the absence of the bill. It would not be \n     appropriate to count such people toward the aggregate \n     direct costs of the bill because their medical expenses \n     would have been insured anyway.\n       In order to complete the estimate, we calculated the direct \n     mandate costs per person who would obtain individual coverage \n     because of this bill. Those costs equal the difference \n     between the added insurance costs of the people who would \n     gain coverage and the premium payments that those newly \n     covered people would make to insurers. Neither the additional \n     insurance costs, nor the additional premium revenue, can be \n     estimated with a high degree of confidence.\n       S. 1028 would prohibit the denial of coverage because of \n     health status or claims experience. Consequently, people \n     gaining coverage through the portability provisions of S. \n     1028 would cost more, on average, than the typical person who \n     currently purchases an individual policy. But, because of the \n     multiple eligibility criteria required by S. 1028, surveys of \n     health expenditures do not provide an adequate basis for a \n     specific estimate of those higher costs.\n       Likewise, the premiums that insurers might charge newly \n     covered people are highly uncertain because they depend on \n     the unknown responses of state insurance regulators that are \n     likely to vary among the states. At one extreme, state \n     regulators might not allow insurers to charge higher premiums \n     for people qualifying under the S. 1028 portability \n     provisions. The loss on those people would then be relatively \n     large. At the other extreme, state regulators might allow \n     insurers to charge them their full expected costs. In that \n     case, there would be no loss to insurers, and consequently no \n     aggregate costs from that mandate.\n       Previous studies offer divergent views on these issues. The \n     Academy assumed that people obtaining individual coverage \n     through the portability provisions would have costs two to \n     three times as high as standard risks.\\6\\ They also assumed \n     that the premiums those people would pay would range from 125 \n     to 167 percent of the average individual premium. That is, \n     the Academy assumed that states would limit what insurers \n     could charge to less than the full cost of the benefit.\n       The Health Insurance Association of America (HIAA) assumed \n     that newly covered people who exhausted their COBRA coverage \n     would have costs between two and three times the average, \n     while the cost of those not eligible for COBRA coverage would \n     be 1.5 to two times the average \\7\\ HIAA made no specific \n     assumptions about the rating rules that states would impose \n     on health plans in the individual market.\n       Although neither the costs nor the insurance premiums \n     associated with the newly covered individuals are known, it \n     is not unreasonable to assume that state insurance \n     commissioners would take the additional costs, and their \n     potential effects, into account in regulating the individual \n     market. If, for example, the expected costs of the newly \n     insured people were high relative to others in the individual \n     market, insurance regulators might allow insurers to charge \n     such people relatively high premiums. Conversely, if the \n     expected costs of the newly insured people were not much \n     higher than others in the individual market, state regulators \n     might not allow their premiums to deviate much from the \n     market average.\n       This relationship can be viewed in terms of a target \n     ``loss'' percentage that regulators might seek. That \n     percentage would be the difference between the cost of \n     coverage and the premium, expressed as a share of the average \n     premium in the individual market. Based on a wide range of \n     possible cost and premium factors, CBO assumed that the \n     insurers' loss percentage associated with the newly covered \n     individuals would be about 70 percent. That is, the \n     difference between premium income and insurance costs for the \n     newly insured people is expected to be about 70 percent of \n     the average premium paid by others in the individual market.\n       Multiplying the loss percentage by the average individual \n     market premium under current law and by the number of newly \n     covered people yields the estimated aggregate direct costs of \n     the group-to-individual portability provision. Those costs \n     are expected to be less than $50 million in the first \n     effective year of the legislation and to rise to about $200 \n     million annually by the fifth year.\n       Other Considerations. For those states in which the \n     individual market mandates are expected to apply, premiums \n     are estimated to be around 0.5 percent higher than otherwise \n     by the end of the first year of implementation and to be \n     approximately 2 percent higher than otherwise by the end of \n     the fifth year. Those premium increases represent the excess \n     costs that presumably would be passed on to people who would \n     have acquired individual policies in the absence of this \n     bill. The estimates of premium increases are limited to those \n     costs attributable to people who obtain insurance in the \n     individual market who would have been uninsured in the \n     absence of S. 1028.\n       If individual insurance premiums rose sufficiently as a \n     consequence of S. 1028, some people with individual coverage \n     would probably drop their insurance. Those most likely to do \n     so would be lower-income people who were not in poor health. \n     CBO used an analysis by Marquis and Long to estimate the \n     number of people who would drop out of the individual \n     insurance market in response to higher premiums.\\8\\ By the \n     fifth year after S. 1028 became effective, about 35,000 \n     people who would have purchased individual policies in the \n     absence of this legislation would not do so. Overall, \n     however, the number of people with insurance in the \n     individual market would probably rise as a result of S. 1028.\n       CBO's estimate assumes that states that already meet the \n     individual market standards in S. 1028 would be granted \n     waivers of those requirements. Initiatives such as guaranteed \n     issue laws and state-sponsored risk pools to provide \n     insurance for high-risk people may qualify states for \n     waivers. The Academy has suggested, however, that states may \n     not seek those waivers even when they are eligible. States \n     might see the provisions of S. 1028 as a mechanism to \n     transfer some individuals out of partially state-subsidized \n     high-risk insurance pools into the private market, where \n     their additional costs would be picked up entirely by the \n     private sector.\n       7.

Mr. President, in response to the number of repeat \ncrimes that are committed by convicted sex offenders, Senator Gramm and \nI are offering legislation to require all such individuals to register \nwith the FBI.\n  Society needs to know where these predators are at all times. \nIndividual States are creating registries of convicted sex offenders \nand devising other measures to address the problem--my home state of \nTexas has moved forward aggressively on this front.\n  Unfortunately, for my State and others, there is a continuing worry \ndespite such progress: individuals convicted of 1,000 cases of child \nmolestation scheduled to be released in Texas this year alone.\n  Currently, 47 States have registry laws which apply to sex offenders, \nbut these track such felons only within the individual State. There is \nno national registry. There is no formal network for law enforcement \nagencies to communicate with each other about know sexual predators. As \na result, a convicted rapist or child molester released in Texas can \nmove to, say, Vermont--which has no registry law--and disappear from \nlaw enforcement records. This ability to move from one State to the \nnext unmonitored has provided tens of thousands of sex offenders with \nthe opportunity to commit yet more deviant acts.\n  The legislation Senator Gramm and I are introducing would close this \nimmense loophole by creating a national computer registry to track \nconvicted sex offenders. Our bill would:\n  Require all sex offenders to register with the FBI for 10 years \nfollowing their release from prison, drawing on State registries.\n  Authorize the FBI to register and track offenders living in States \nwith no registry program.\n  Require the FBI to ensure that local authorities are notified every \ntime a sex offender moves into or out of their jurisdiction.\n  Allow private and community organizations access to the sex offender \nfiles through their local law enforcement agencies;\n  Preserve State authority in determining whether (or how) the public \nat large will be notified of the presence of sex offenders in a \ncommunity.\n  Provide penalties for those who fail to register.\n\n[[Page S3485]]\n\n  This will provide a tracking program nationwide. It is an appropriate \nfunction of the Federal Government to keep tabs on such offenders--and \nhelp to arm communities with information that might well prevent \nfuture, similar, horrifying crimes. We know that 40 percent of \nconvicted sex offenders will repeat their crimes. We must begin acting \non that information.\n  Mr. President, Senator Gramm and I are not asking that any money be \nappropriated for this purpose--the FBI can create such a tracking \nsystem with existing resources. And this is how Federal agencies should \nbe spending the taxpayers' money: on protecting them and their \nchildren, and making their communities safer, less threatening places \nto live.\n  One of the ultimate responsibilities of Government is the protection \nof its citizens--especially its youngest and most vulnerable. This \nmeasure does not seek to impose additional punishment on sex \noffenders--but it is aimed at providing society at large with an \nelement of self-defense that it does not enjoy now.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/04/17/senate-section/article/S3484-1", "month": "04", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "17", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3485]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                TAX DAY\n\n  Mr. PELL. Mr. President, Tax Day has come and gone, and I would wager \nthat few outside of Washington, DC, marked its passing because they \nwere so absorbed in the last minute preparation and filing of income \ntax returns. Most paid scant heed to this congressionally created day \nof moment, which, in my view, panders irresponsibly to popular aversion \nto taxation.\n  It is far more responsible, in my view, to emphasize the positive \naspects of public finance. Most Federal taxes flow right back to \nAmericans in benefits and services. Federal taxes here includes both \nFederal income taxes and Federal payroll or Social Security taxes. \nPayroll taxes are used to pay Social Security and Medicare benefits to \nour elderly and disabled. Income taxes are used to fund the operations \nof our Government which include the provision of student loans for \neducation, maintenance of our national parks and museums, low-interest \nmortgage loans for first-time home buyers, veterans benefits, \nunemployment compensation, and our military defense, among other \nthings.\n  I am advised that Federal entitlements--benefits citizens are \nentitled to collect if they meet certain demographic or income \ndefinition--reach 49 percent of U.S. households, including 39 percent \nof families with children and 98 percent of the elderly.\n  Moreover, in my view, Americans are not overtaxes in comparison with \nother nations. The highest statutory marginal individual income tax \nrate in the United States, 39.6 percent, is relatively low by \ninternational standards. France, Germany, Italy, and Japan have tax \nrates that are substantially higher, reaching 56.8 percent. By another \nmeasure, using total tax receipts as a percent of gross domestic \nproduct [GDP], the United States has an average tax rate of 31.5 \npercent. The United Kingdom, Italy, Germany, Canada, and France are all \nsignificantly higher, with several having average tax rates in excess \nof 40 percent of GDP.\n  Of course, constant restraint and diligence must be exercised to make \nsure that waste, fraud, and abuse are avoided at all times. But \noverall, I believe that our Federal Government has had, and continues \nto have, a positive impact on the lives of most Americans. In the words \nof Justice Holmes, ``taxes are what we pay for civilized society.'' In \nthe end, we get what we pay for.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/04/17/senate-section/article/S3485-1", "month": "04", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "17", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3485]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Thomas, one of his secretaries.\n\n\n                      executive messages referred\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/04/17/senate-section/article/S3485-2", "month": "04", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "17", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3485]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n REPORT OF THE NATIONAL ENDOWMENT FOR THE HUMANITIES FOR CALENDAR YEAR \n                1995--MESSAGE FROM THE PRESIDENT--PM 138\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER laid before the Senate the following message \nfrom the President of the United States, together with an accompanying \nreport; which was referred to the Committee on Labor and Human \nResources.\n\nTo the Congress of the United States:\n  I am pleased to present to you the 1995 Annual Report of the National \nEndowment for the Humanities (NEH). For 30 years, this Federal agency \nhas given Americans great opportunities to explore and share with each \nother our country's vibrant and diverse cultural heritage. Its work \nsupports an impressive array of humanities projects.\n  These projects have mined every corner of our tradition, unearthing \nall the distinct and different voices, emotions, and ideas that \ntogether make up what is a uniquely American culture. In 1995, they \nranged from an award-winning television documentary on President \nFranklin Delano Roosevelt, the radio production Wade in the Water, to \npreservation projects that will rescue 750,000 important books from \nobscurity and archive small community newspapers from every State in \nthe Union. Pandora's Box, a traveling museum exhibit of women and myth \nin classical Greece, drew thousands of people.\n  The humanities have long helped Americans bridge differences, learn \nto appreciate one another, shore up the foundations of our democracy, \nand build strong and vital institutions across our country. At a time \nwhen our society faces new and profound challenges, when so many \nAmericans feel insecure in the face of change, the presence and \naccessibility of the humanities in all our lives can be a powerful \nsource of our renewal and our unity as we move forward into the 21st \ncentury.\n                                                  William J.

A bill to clarify the application of Federal preemption of \nState and local laws, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nGovernmental Affairs.\n\n\n        the preemption clarification and information act of 1996\n\n Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, today I am introducing the \nPreemption and Clarification Act of 1996. It would require an explicit \nstatement of Federal preemption in Federal legislation in order for \nsuch preemption to occur unless there exists a direct conflict between \nthe Federal law and a State or local law which cannot be reconciled. \nEnactment of this bill would close the back door of implied Federal \npreemption and put the responsibility for determining whether or not \nState or local governments should be preempted back in Congress where \nit belongs.\n  State and local officials have become increasingly concerned with the \nnumber of instances in which State and local laws have been preempted \nby Federal law--not because Congress has done so explicitly, but \nbecause the courts have implied such preemption. Since 1789, Congress \nhas enacted approximately 350 laws specifically preempting State and \nlocal authority. Half of these laws have been enacted in the last 20 \nyears. These figures, however, do not touch upon the extensive Federal \npreemption of State and local authority which has occurred as a result \nof judicial interpretation of congressional intent, when Congress' \nintention to preempt has not been explicitly stated in law. When \nCongress is unclear about its intent to preempt, the courts must then \ndecide whether or not preemption was intended and, if so, to what \nextent.\n  Article VI of the Constitution, the supremacy clause, states that \nFederal laws made pursuant to the Constitution ``shall be the supreme \nlaw of the land.'' In its most basic sense, this clause means that a \nState law is negated or preempted when it is in conflict with a \nconstitutionally enacted Federal law. A significant body of case law \nhas been developed to arrive at\n\n[[Page S3488]]\n\nstandards by which to judge whether or not Congress intended to preempt \nState or local authority--standards which are subjective and have not \nresulted in a consistent and predictable doctrine in resolving \npreemption questions.\n  If we in Congress want Federal law to prevail, we should be clear \nabout that. If we want the States to have discretion to go beyond \nFederal requirements, we should be clear about that. If, for example, \nwe set a floor in a Federal statute, but are silent on actions which \nmeet but then go beyond the Federal requirement, State and local \ngovernments should be able to act as they deem appropriate. State and \nlocal governments should not have to wait to see what they can and \ncannot do. Our bill would allow tougher State and local laws given \ncongressional silence.\n  Our legislation also requires the Congressional Research Service, at \nthe end of each Congress, to compile a report on the number of \nstatutory and judicially interpreted preemptions. This will constitute \nthe first time such a complete report has been done, and the \ninformation will be valuable to the debate regarding the appropriate \nuse of preemption to reach Federal goals.\n  I introduced this bill in the 102d Congress with Senator David \nDurenburger. A form of the bill was included in the unfunded mandates \nlaw we passed in the spring of last year. That provision, now law, \nrequires that when a committee of the Senate or House reports a bill, \nthe report accompanying the bill is required to contain an explicit \nstatement of the extent to which the bill is intended to preempt any \nState, local or tribal law and if so, an explanation of the effect of \nsuch preemption. That provision of the unfunded mandates law is an \nattempt to get congressional committees to address the issue of \npreemption before legislation is reported to the floor of the House or \nSenate. In reviewing several bills that are now on the Senate Calendar \nawaiting Senate action, I was disappointed to find that none of the \nones I reviewed met the requirements of this provision. We can and \nshould do better.\n  This bill, unlike the provision in the unfunded mandates law where \nsilence in the report leaves the issue unresolved, this bill \nestablishes a principle for the courts to follow in determining a \npreemption case where the bill is silent on the matter. This bill tells \nthe court that if the statement of intent to preempt is not in the \nlegislation then the court is not authorized to read it into the \nstatute--unless there is a direct conflict between Federal and State \nlaw. If legislation is silent, there is no preemption.\n\n  Earlier this year the Governmental Affairs Committee held a hearing \non a bill entitled the ``Tenth Amendment Enforcement Act of 1996.'' It \ncontains a section on judicial construction which is virtually the same \nas that contained in this bill and the bill I introduced in the 102d \nCongress. The tenth amendment bill, however, has other provisions that \nare troublesome. I am introducing my bill today in the hope that we can \nenact this provision into law, this year, and leave the more \ntroublesome features of the Tenth Amendment Enforcement Act of 1996 for \nanother day.\n  Mr. President, preemption clarification legislation has been endorsed \nby the National Conference of State Legislators, the Intergovernmental \nAffairs Committee of the Council of State Governments, the U.S. \nConference of Mayors, and the Appellate Judges Conference of the \nAmerican Bar Association.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1679\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Preemption Clarification and \n     Information Act of 1996''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       The Congress finds that--\n       (1) the United States Constitution created a strong Federal \n     system, reserving to the States all powers not expressly \n     delegated to the Federal Government;\n       (2) on numerous occasions, the Congress has enacted \n     statutes that explicitly preempt State and local government \n     powers and describe the scope of the preemption;\n       (3) in addition to statutes that explicitly preempt State \n     and local government powers, many other statutes that lack an \n     explicit statement by Congress of its intent to preempt and a \n     clear description of the scope of the preemption have been \n     construed by the courts and Federal agencies to preempt State \n     and local government powers; and\n       (4) without an explicit statement of Congress' intent to \n     preempt State and local government powers and a clear \n     description of the scope of preemption, preemptive statutes--\n       (A) provide too little guidance and leave too much \n     discretion to Federal agencies which are required to \n     promulgate and enforce regulations pursuant to statutes;\n       (B) create too great an uncertainty for State and local \n     governments; and\n       (C) leave the presence or scope of preemption to be \n     litigated and determined by the Federal judiciary, producing \n     results sometimes contrary to or beyond the intent of \n     Congress.\n\n     SEC. 3. PURPOSE.\n\n       The purposes of this Act are to--\n       (1) promote and preserve the integrity and effectiveness of \n     the Federal system;\n       (2) set forth principles governing the interpretation of \n     congressional intent regarding preemption of State and local \n     government powers by Federal laws and regulations; and\n       (3) establish an information collection system designed to \n     monitor the incidence of Federal statutory and regulatory \n     preemption.\n\n     Sec. 4. DEFINITIONS.\n\n       As used in this Act, the term--\n       (1) ``local government'' means a county, city, town, \n     borough, township, village, school district, special \n     district, or other political subdivision of a State;\n       (2) ``State'' means a State of the United States and an \n     agency or instrumentality of a State, but does not include a \n     local government of a State; and\n       (3) ``State and local government powers'' means powers \n     reserved under the ninth and tenth amendments of the United \n     States Constitution to States or delegated to local \n     governments by States.\n\n     SEC. 5. RULE OF CONSTRUCTION.\n\n       No statute, or rule promulgated under such statute, shall \n     preempt, in whole or in part, any State or local government \n     law, ordinance, or regulation, unless the statute explicitly \n     states that such preemption is intended or unless there is a \n     direct conflict between such statute and a State or local \n     law, ordinance, or regulation so the two cannot be reconciled \n     or consistently stand together.\n\n     SEC. 6. ANNUAL REPORT ON STATUTORY PREEMPTION.\n\n       (a) Report.--Within 90 days after each Congress adjourns \n     sine die, the Congressional Research Service shall prepare \n     and make available to the public a report on the extent of \n     Federal statutory preemption of State and local government \n     powers enacted into law during the preceding Congress or \n     adopted through judicial interpretation of Federal statutes.\n       (b) Contents.--The report shall contain--\n       (1) a cumulative list of the Federal statutes preempting, \n     in whole or in part, State and local government powers;\n       (2) a summary of Federal legislation enacted during the \n     previous Congress preempting, in whole or in part, State and \n     local government powers;\n       (3) an overview of recent court cases addressing Federal \n     preemption issues; and\n       (4) other information the Director of the Congressional \n     Research Service determines appropriate.\n       (c) Transmittal.--Copies of the report shall be sent to the \n     President and the chairman of the appropriate committees in \n     the Senate and House of Representatives.\n\n     SEC. 7. EFFECTIVE DATE.\n\n       This Act shall take effect on January 1, 1997. The \n     requirements of section 5 shall apply only to statutes \n     enacted or final regulations which become effective on or \n     after January 1, 1997.\n       By Mr. SPECTER (for himself and Mrs. Feinstein):\n\n  S. 1681.

Mr. President, it is well known that there is an \nenormous international threat posed by weapons of mass destruction.\n  Testimony which was recently heard by the Senate Intelligence \nCommittee, which I chair, disclosed that some 25 nations have weapons \nof mass destruction including nuclear weapons, biological weapons, and \nchemical weapons.\n  In testimony offered by John Deutch in 1994, when he was Deputy \nSecretary of Defense, he pointed out that ``If North Koreans build the \nTaepo Dong II missile, Alaska and parts of Hawaii would be potentially \nat risk.'' I think it is not well known that parts of the\n\n[[Page S3489]]\n\nUnited States are potentially at risk from long-range missiles.\n  We have seen the development of biological weapons by Saddam Hussein \nwhich was confirmed last August by his son-in-law following his \ndefection. We see the building of chemical weapons by Qadhafi noted \nrecently by Secretary of Defense Perry with his statement that we could \nnot tolerate the completion of those weapons of mass destruction. We \nhave seen China sell missiles to Pakistan. We have seen the tremendous \ntension building up on the subcontinent with both Pakistan and India \nengaging in a missile race.\n  In the United States, Mr. President, while we have noted the enormous \nproblems on weapons of mass destruction, we have seen a governmental \nstructure which is extraordinarily complicated and really unable to \ndeal in a coordinated method with this tremendous problem.\n  This chart depicts the problems in the United States of the numerous \nagencies which have jurisdiction in one way or another over weapons of \nmass destruction. This chart contains boxes depicting 96 different \nentities which have authority of one sort or another over this field.\n  We have some authority vested in the National Security Council. We \nhave some authority vested in the Department of Defense, some authority \nvested in the Department of State, some in the Department of Justice, \nsome in the Department of Energy, some with the Director of Central \nIntelligence, others even with the Secretary of Health and Human \nServices, still further authority in the Secretary of the Treasury and \nauthority in the Secretary of Commerce.\n  This is on its face an enormously unwieldy Federal bureaucracy, and \nthat is our response to the problem of weapons of mass destruction. And \nas shown by this chart it is obviously a bureaucracy which cannot \nfunction efficiently.\n  In 1993, when I studied the Clinton health program, I asked an \nassistant to make a listing of all the agencies, boards and \ncommissions, and my assistant made a chart instead which depicted an \nenormous bureaucracy, which was influential in helping to defeat that \nhealth care program. If a picture is worth 1,000 words, a chart may be \nworth 1,000 pictures, Mr. President, and I think that this chart shows \nthe urgency of some reorganization of the Federal Government to deal \nwith this enormous problem.\n  The study of the congressionally mandated Commission on Roles and \nMissions of the Armed Forces pointed out that ``Despite the declared \nnational emergency, there is no evidence that combating proliferation \nreceives continuous high level attention.'' The study's conclusion is \nworth noting and emphasizing:\n  Mechanisms for effectively integrating the combating proliferation \nactivities of all departments and agencies are lacking. Given the \ncomplexity of the tasks involved, the need for marshaling resources \nfrom many agencies, and the necessarily protracted nature of these \nefforts, the failure to assign clear and empowered leadership has \nimpeded the United States effort.\n  That conclusion is obvious in taking a look at the enormous \ncomplicated bureaucracy in the United States assigned to deal with this \nproblem.\n  In looking at the solution, I have considered a number of \nalternatives. One option is the creation of ``czar,'' such as the drug \nczar empowered to coordinate activities against drugs in United States. \nI have considered the creation of a high-level position on the National \nSecurity Council staff. I have considered the option of having a second \nDeputy Secretary of Defense. I have also considered the option of a new \nAssistant Secretary of Defense [ASD], like the ASD for special \noperations and low-intensity conflict created in the late 1980's as a \nresult of legislation introduced by Senator Cohen and Senator Nunn.\n  I have decided instead that this matter ought to be studied by a high \nlevel special commission like the Aspin-Brown Commission, which \nrecently filed a comprehensive report to reorganize the U.S. \nintelligence community. This is a matter which can be most effectively \ndealt with by experts on a commission. Rather than the introduction of \nlegislation and the holding of hearings, the commission would have a \nmuch broader purview and that is the legislation which I am introducing \ntoday.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that my legislation, together \nwith a chart depicting this complicated bureaucracy which now seeks to \ndeal with this problem of great national and international importance, \nbe printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1681\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Labor and Human Resources:\n\n                            S. Con. Res. 52\n\n       Whereas many States have encouraged and facilitated the \n     creation of senior citizen legislative and advocacy bodies;\n       Whereas in creating such bodies such States have provided \n     to many older Americans the opportunity to express concerns, \n     promote appropriate interests, and advance the common good by \n     influencing the legislation and actions of State government; \n     and\n       Whereas a National Silver-Haired Congress, with \n     representatives from each State, would provide a national \n     forum for a nonpartisan evaluation of grassroots solutions to \n     concerns shared by an increasing number of older Americans: \n     Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives \n     concurring), That the congress hereby recognizes and \n     encourages the convening of an annual National Silver-Haired \n     Congress in the District of Columbia.\n\n Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I submit a concurrent resolution \nto recognize and encourage the convening of a national silver-haired \ncongress. This concurrent resolution passed the Senate and the House of \nRepresentatives in 1994. Unfortunately, since each concurrent \nresolution was not voted on by the other Chamber, neither was \ntechnically adopted.\n  That is why I am resubmitting this legislation--I think it is \nimportant, and I want both Houses to formally endorse this plan. As \nranking member of the Aging Subcommittee, I am joined by Senators Cohen \nand Pryor, chair and ranking member of the Special Subcommittee on \nAging, and many more of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle in \nsponsoring this important piece of legislation.\n  What is a national silver-haired congress? Well, it is the vision of \na truly inspirational group of seniors. Beginning back in 1973, a group \nof Missouri seniors got together and decided to get involved. They \nformed a silver-haired legislature. They modeled their legislature \nafter the State's and took up pieces of legislation that affected \nseniors.\n  That was 1973. Today, almost half the States have silver-haired \nlegislatures. These mock legislatures take bills through the entire \nlegislative process and present their bills that they pass to their \nState legislators. These recommendations are taken very seriously. The \nsilver-haired legislatures have helped in the passage of many programs: \nfrom consumer protections and crime prevention to health care, housing, \nand long-term care.\n  I am submitting today a concurrent resolution to create the first \nnational silver-haired congress. Based on the experience of the silver-\nhaired legislatures in the States, this silver-haired congress would \nprovide a national forum for aging issues--a forum patterned after the \nU.S. Congress. It will be completely staffed by older Americans, and \nserve to address the broad range of seniors issues. Like us, this \nsilver-haired congress would be comprised of 100 senators and 435 \nrepresentatives. But unlike us, all the members will serve without pay.\n  The population of older Americans is growing at a faster rate than \nany other age group. As this elderly population grows, it is more \nimportant than ever to encourage the input of seniors in our political \nprocess. At no cost whatsoever to the American public, a national \nsilver-haired congress will provide a national forum for issues of \nconcern to older Americans. The input and counsel that a forum like \nthis will provide to the U.S. Congress is invaluable.\n  It is with great enthusiasm and excitement that I submit this \nconcurrent resolution and ask my colleagues to support this wonderful \nproposal for a national silver-haired congress.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/04/17/senate-section/article/S3491-1", "month": "04", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "17", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3491]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nSENATE RESOLUTION 246--RELATIVE TO THE SPECIAL COMMITTEE TO INVESTIGATE \n        WHITE- WATER DEVELOPMENT CORPORATION AND RELATED MATTERS\n\n  Mr. DOLE submitted the following resolution; which was considered and \nagreed to:\n\n                              S.

Res. 247\n\n       Whereas Greece and Turkey are engaged in a dispute over \n     sovereignty to an islet in the Aegean Sea called Imia by \n     Greece and Kardak by Turkey:\n       Whereas the islet is a dependent of the Island of Calimnos, \n     an island in the Dodecanese region of the Aegean Sea:\n       Whereas in Article 15 of the Treaty of Peace with Turkey, \n     and other Instruments, signed at Lausanne on July 24, 1923, \n     Turkey renounced in favor of Italy all right and title of \n     Turkey over 12 islands in the Dodecanese region that were \n     occupied at the time of the Treaty by Italy, including the \n     Island of Calimnos, and the islets dependent on such islands;\n       Whereas the Convention Between Italy and Turkey for the \n     Delimitation of the Territorial Waters Between the Coasts of \n     Anatolia and the Island of Castellorizio, signed at Ankara on \n     January 4, 1932, established the rights of Italy and Turkey \n     in coastal islands, waters, and rocks in the Aegean Sea and \n     delimited a maritime frontier between the two countries:\n       Whereas a Protocol to that Convention established a border \n     between Italy and Turkey which placed the islet under the \n     control of Italy;\n       Whereas in Article 14 of the 1947 Treaty of Peace with \n     Italy, Italy ceded to Greece the Island of Calimnos and \n     adjacent islets;\n       Whereas the Eastern Mediterranean region, in which the \n     Aegean Sea is located, is a region of vital strategic \n     importance to the United States;\n       Whereas both Greece and Turkey are members of the North \n     Atlantic Treaty Organization and allies of the United States;\n\n[[Page S3492]]\n\n       Whereas it is in the interest of the United States and \n     other nations to have the dispute resolved peacefully; and\n       Whereas the International Court of Justice in The Hague was \n     established to promote the peaceful resolution of \n     international disputes in conformity with international law: \n     Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That it is the sense of the Senate that the \n     Government of Greece and the Government of Turkey should--\n       (1) submit to the International Court of Justice in The \n     Hague the dispute of such governments over sovereignty to the \n     islet in the Aegean Sea called Imia by Greece and Kardak by \n     Turkey; and\n       (2) agree to be bound by the decision of the Court with \n     respect to the dispute.\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, for thousands of years, the Aegean Sea, \nand the Eastern Mediterranean as a whole, has been a critical \ngeopolitical region. I believe it is in the national interest of the \nUnited States to have the countries in this region resolve their \ndisputes peacefully. As former Assistant Secretary of State Richard \nHolbrook recently noted, ``you cannot have the southern flank of NATO \nin constant tension without having strategic instability, which will \nultimately wreck NATO.''\n  Unfortunately, Greece and Turkey--both members of NATO, and both \nallies of the United States--have been locked in bitter conflict for \nmany hundreds of years. The case of Cyprus is a tragic recent example. \nI am concerned that in such a climate of hostility, relatively minor \ndisputes could erupt into major conflict. It could be a war which would \nspread to that area.\n  The most recent manifestation of tension between Greece and Turkey \ncenters on Imia and other islets in the Aegean. The sovereignty \nquestions are quite complex, and involve treaties and other agreements \nsigned after World War I and World War II, including the Paris Peace \nTreaty of 1947, the Italo-Turkish Agreement of 1932, and the 1923 \nLausanne Peace Treaty. Simply put, each nation claims the islet of \nImia, called Kardak by Turkey, as part of its national territory.\n  However, I believe that this dispute should be resolved in the \nInternational Court of Justice [ICJ] at The Hague. The ICJ was \nestablished to promote the peaceful resolution of international \ndisputes in conformity with international law. The dispute over the \nislet of Imia is, in my judgment, an ideal candidate for adjudication \nby The Hague.\n  It is for that reason I am submitting this sense of the Senate \nresolution, which calls upon Greece and Turkey to submit their dispute \nto the ICJ, and agree to be bound by the decision of the court. The \nEastern Mediterranean is a region of critical importance. I believe \nthat it is essential to resolve conflict peacefully, and to work with \nthe countries of the region to resolve key issues in a way that is \nconsistent with the rule of law. This resolution, in my judgment, is a \ncritical first step in ensuring that relatively minor conflicts do not \nescalate into major ones.\n  Mr. President, I will read the resolve clause of the resolution:\n\n       That it is the sense of the Senate that the Government of \n     Greece and the Government of Turkey should--\n       (1) submit to the International Court of Justice in The \n     Hague the dispute of such governments over sovereignty to the \n     islet in the Aegean Sea called Imia by Greece and Kardak by \n     Turkey; and\n       (2) agree to be bound by the decision of the Court with \n     respect to that dispute.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/04/17/senate-section/article/S3491-3", "month": "04", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "17", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3492-S3493]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED\n\n                                 ______\n\n\n                THE HEALTH INSURANCE REFORM ACT OF 1996\n\n                                 ______\n\n\n                       THOMAS AMENDMENT NO. 3673\n\n  (Ordered to lie on the table.)\n  Mr. THOMAS submitted an amendment intended to be proposed by him to \nthe bill (S. 1028) to provide increased access to health care benefits, \nto provide increased portability of health care benefits, to provide \nincreased security of health care benefits, to increase the purchasing \npower of individuals and small employers, and for other purposes; as \nfollows:\n\n       At the end of the bill, insert the following new section:\n\n     SEC.   .

Mr. President, I wanted to take a few additional \nminutes today to talk through my recent discussions with veterans' \norganization from Pennsylvania about legislation recently introduced by \nSenator Simpson.\n  Senator Simpson, at the request of four major veterans organizations, \nhas introduced legislation addressing various inequities in the manner \nin which we treat the health of our Nation's veterans. Many of those \nissues addressed in the bill speak to issues I have witnessed, \ndiscussed, and worked on during my 5 years in Congress and as a former \nmember of the House Veterans' Affairs Committee. Issues relating to the \ncare and treatment of veterans and efforts to improve the veterans' \nhealth delivery system are very familiar and important to me.\n  Mr. President, I was born and raised on the grounds of a VA hospital \nfacility, and I understand the concerns of veterans in this matter. My \nmother and father spent their careers working for veterans in Veterans' \nAdministration hospitals. Our veterans fought on many battlefields to \npreserve the liberty of succeeding generations of Americans.\n  Today, one of the greatest threats to our children and grandchildren \nis not as much the imminent outbreak of war and the subsequent call to \nservice, but rather the massive national debt and annual Federal \ndeficits. If nothing is done, the next generation will face a future of \ndiminished opportunity and a declining standard of living.\n  While service to our country has entitled veterans to very unique \nbenefits that are available to no other single group of Americans, \nthese benefits are by no means the root cause of our huge Federal \ndeficits. I have fought against unnecessary cuts in veterans' programs \nthat would have compromised our Nation's commitment to those who have \nserved in defense of our freedom.\n  At the same time, however, any new spending on veterans' programs or \nbenefits must be treated with an equal eye toward fiscal \nresponsibility--sufficient spending reductions must occur within the \nVeterans' Administration itself or in other areas of Federal spending. \nAt this time, the Simpson bill carries with it a revenue effect of $13 \nbillion in new spending. I believe that the sponsor and I would both \nacknowledge that this bill should not move through the legislative \nprocess without a corresponding $13 billion in spending reductions.\n  These rules and budget realities are the same that I have operated \nunder during my entire service in Congress. Recently, I fought on the \nSenate floor for sufficient spending reductions of $1.2 billion to \ncover and offset the costs of Federal disaster assistance, a large \nportion of which would benefit Pennsylvania communities as we rebuild \nfrom a blizzard and flood-ravaged winter. And in continuing to address \nthe needs of our Nation's veterans, I will maintain this same standard.\n  Until such spending reductions are finalized and presented, Mr. \nPresident, I will temporarily withhold my own efforts and development \non S. 1543. I understand that the administration is working on a \nlegislative proposal similar to the Simpson bill, and that they are \nworking through the same budget realities in producing a revenue \nneutral package. I remain committed to supporting our Nation's \nveterans. I support the direction and concept of the Simpson bill, and \nI will work with the sponsor to find cuts to pay for the costs of the \nbill.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/04/17/senate-section/article/S3494-1", "month": "04", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "17", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3494]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      BOSTON'S ENGLISH HIGH SCHOOL\n\n Mr. KERRY.

Mr. President, one of the recent decisions that was \na most unfortunate one was the decision by the U.S. Court of Appeals \nthat colleges and universities cannot keep in mind diversity as they \nput together a student body.\n  No one was advocating quotas in this case, nor advocating that people \nwho are not qualified should be admitted.\n  But to deny that diversity is part of the learning experiences of \ncolleges and universities is to deny reality.\n  I hope the decision will be overturned.\n  We have enough backsliding in the field of race relations. We do not \nneed to add the handicap of a bad court decision as another barrier.\n  Recently, Anthony Lewis had a column titled, ``Handcuffs on \nLearning''; and the New York Times had an editorial titled, ``Bad Law \non Affirmative Action''. I ask that both articles be printed in the \nRecord and I urge my colleagues to read them.\n\n[[Page S3495]]\n\n  The articles follow:\n\n                [From the New York Times, Mar. 22, 1996]\n\n                     Bad Law on Affirmative Action\n\n       For two decades the governing principle of affirmative \n     action in higher education has been that race and ethnicity \n     may be a factor, but only one factor, in choosing among \n     applicants in pursuit of the legitimate purpose of a diverse \n     student body. That was the judgment of the Supreme Court in \n     the celebrated 1978 case of Allan Bakke, a white applicant \n     who sued for entry to a California state medical school.\n       Now a panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth \n     Circuit declares that the Bakke decision is no longer good \n     law. In a lawsuit by four rejected white applicants, the \n     court strikes down a program of the University of Texas Law \n     School to bring more blacks and Mexican-Americans into its \n     student body. This tool is impermissible, say the judges, \n     ``even for the wholesome purpose of correcting perceived \n     racial imbalance in the student body.''\n       The ruling is hasty, aggressively activist and legally \n     dubious. If the Bakke decision is no longer the law, it is \n     for the Supreme Court to say so. We hope the high court does \n     not, for its basic rule is sound. Rigid racial quotas are \n     out, but no serious educational institution should be forced \n     to disregard the goal of educating a diverse population.\n       To reach this result, the appeals judges engaged in exotic \n     reasoning. They found that a now-retired Justice, Lewis \n     Powell, who announced the judgment in Bakke, spoke only for \n     himself on the racial diversity question. It is true that he \n     was joined in the judgment by four other justices who relied \n     on different legal grounds, but Justice Powell's announcement \n     has soundly been regarded as the rule of the Bakke case for \n     nearly a generation. Moreover, it has been widely hailed as \n     the work of a respected moderate well grounded in experience \n     as head of the school board in Richmond, Va.\n       Texas higher education officials have commendably sought \n     diversity, but they cannot fairly be accused of adhering to \n     rigid quotas. The diverse statewide population is 11.6 \n     percent black and 25.6 percent Hispanic; while the 1992 law \n     school entering class was 8 percent black and 10.7 percent \n     Hispanic. Yet the appeals court says the school may not use \n     ``ethnic diversity simply to achieve racial heterogeneity, \n     even as part of the consideration of a number of factors.''\n       That is the doctrine of a ``color-blind'' Constitution, but \n     it speaks to a time not yet here when the historic stain of \n     racial oppression is erased, competition is truly equal and \n     diversity comes more naturally. As another former Justice, \n     Harry Blackmun, observed in the same Bakke case, ``In order \n     to get beyond racism, we must first take account of race. . . \n     . And in order to treat some persons equally, we must treat \n     them differently. . . . The ultimate question, as it was at \n     the beginning of this litigation, is: Among the qualified, \n     how does one choose?''\n       The appeals court judges, eager to be the first to declare \n     the battle for equal right over, have rendered a judgment \n     that should not stand.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n                [From the New York Times, Mar. 22, 1996]\n\n                         Handcuffs on Learning\n\n                           (By Anthony Lewis)\n\n       San Diego.--Universities around the world came to \n     understand long ago that the quality of education improved if \n     they had students with varying life experiences. That is why \n     Oxford colleges sought working-class students. It is why \n     Harvard, Yale and Princeton are far better universities today \n     than when they were confined largely to privileged young \n     white men.\n       In the life of Americans, race is a profound factor. Blacks \n     may be bright or dull, rich or poor, but their experience in \n     life has been different from whites'. And so, long before the \n     phrase ``affirmative action'' was invented, universities \n     thought it wise to have students of varied racial \n     backgrounds.\n       The freedom of American universities to consider race along \n     with other factors in choosing students has just been struck \n     a devastating legal blow. It came in the decision of the \n     United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit in the \n     case of Hopwood v. Texas.\n       The University of Texas Law School some years ago had what \n     amounted to a segregated admissions process. Minority \n     applicants were considered by a separate committee and on \n     different standards.\n       Cheryl Hopwood and other rejected white applicants sued, \n     claiming that that system denied them the ``equal protection \n     of the laws'' guaranteed by the 14th Amendment. The Fifth \n     Circuit, ruling in their favor, could have limited itself to \n     the particular admissions process at issue. But it went much \n     further.\n       The court said that the Texas law school ``may not use race \n     as a factor'' in admissions. It did not speak of a dominant \n     or even significant factor but outlawed consideration of race \n     as any factor at all. Moreover, in an extraordinary display \n     of hostility, the court left the way open for the plaintiffs \n     to collect money damages for what it said was ``intentional \n     discrimination.''\n       The Equal Protection Clause of the Constitution, which the \n     court found violated, applies only to state action. But \n     private universities may also be affected. Civil rights laws \n     forbid racial discrimination at private universities that \n     receive any kind of Federal aid--and nearly all do.\n       The ultimate danger is to the freedom of American \n     universities. The Fifth Circuit treated this case as if it \n     were the same as the Supreme Court's recent decisions \n     limiting set-asides for minority contractors and broadcast \n     licensees. But education is different. Its freedom in \n     decisionmaking--an urgent need in our society--has to be \n     weighed against the rightful claims of equal protection.\n       Reading the Fifth Circuit's opinion, by Judge Jerry E. \n     Smith, one feels a sense of detachment from reality. For \n     instance, it rejects as racist the assumption that an \n     individual ``possesses characteristics'' because of his race. \n     Right. But the issue is not characteristics. It is \n     experience. And any judge who thinks black Americans have not \n     had a different experience is blind.\n       Think about women judges or Supreme Court justices. They \n     are not wiser or less wise by virtue of their gender. But \n     they have had a different experience from men, and that is \n     why it is important to have them on the bench.\n       The reality of university admissions, as opposed to the \n     mechanical abstractions of the Fifth Circuit decision, is on \n     display here in California. Gov. Pete Wilson, playing to \n     white male resentment, pushed through the Board of Regents a \n     rule forbidding the use of race or gender as a factor in \n     admissions to the University of California.\n       Now it turns out that regents who voted for what they \n     called ``merit'' admissions had leaned on the University of \n     California at Los Angeles to admit the children of friends. \n     An investigation by The Los Angeles Times shows that U.C.L.A. \n     gave special consideration to children of politicians and the \n     rich.\n       In other words, we have affirmative action for the \n     privileged. But not for the race that was enslaved for 200 \n     years and abused for another 100 and more.\n       Universities, in their freedom, can increase understanding \n     across the racial lines in this country. Unless the Supreme \n     Court undoes this assault on their freedom, we are going to \n     be an even more divided society.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/04/17/senate-section/article/S3494-4", "month": "04", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "17", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3495-S3496]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     THE RECENT BOMBINGS IN ISRAEL\n\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. Mr. President, I would first like to congratulate \nPresident Clinton for his leadership at the ``Summit of Peacemakers'' \nconference which was recently convened in Egypt. I salute the President \nand the other world leaders who gathered in Sharm El Sheik for their \navowed support of the Middle East peace process and their strong \nshowing of international solidarity against terrorism.\n  I also want to extend my heartfelt sympathy and condolences to the \nfamilies of those murdered in the recent terrorist attacks in Israel. \nMay the Almighty comfort them among the mourners of Zion and Jerusalem. \nAs the Nation of Israel mourns the loss of its sons and daughters, I \npray that the story of Purim will serve to comfort the entire family of \nIsrael and give it hope, knowing that God will deliver the Jewish \npeople today as in the past.\n  Mr. President, I condemn in the strongest of terms the barbarous acts \nof organized and random terrorism against innocent Israeli civilians, \nincluding young children. Those responsible for these indiscriminate \nand cowardly acts of murder and violence must be held accountable for \ntheir actions and brought to justice. Their punishment must be swift, \ndecisive and thorough, not only to serve as a deterrent, but as a \nreminder that the world community will never allow the evils of \nterrorism to triumph over the forces of peace.\n  I call upon the peace and freedom loving peoples of Gaza, the West \nBank and the Arab world to condemn outright these heinous acts of \nbarbarism allegedly committed on their behalf and in their name. These \nacts do not further Palestinian interests nor, I believe, do they \nrepresent the sentiments of the overwhelming majority of the \nPalestinian people. I further enjoin them to outlaw, expose, disarm and \narrest members of paramilitary organizations within their midst and to \ndeny them sanctuary and safe haven. Their presence and actions are a \nthreat not only to the State of Israel, but also to the Palestinian \nself-rule national authority in the West Bank and Gaza.\n  Mr. President, we can no longer afford to look at terrorism and \nsuicide bombings in Israel--and in other parts of the world --as a \ndistant danger. The bombing of the World Trade Center in New York City \nin February 1993 and the bombing of the Federal building in Oklahoma \nCity last April have shattered our false notions of security. Anti-\nterrorism units, swat teams, and bomb squads train with the same \nintensity and seriousness of purpose as sprinters, long distance \nrunners, swimmers, and gymnasts in their preparation for this summer's \nOlympic games in Atlanta. In truth, every act of terrorism--in Israel \nor elsewhere--strikes\n\n[[Page S3496]]\n\nat the essence of all free, democratic and open societies. Our \ndisagreements are dealt with civility and without violence or the \nthreat of violence.\n  With each terrorist threat against the Government, our citizens lose \na measure of their freedom. When an American seeks to exercise even the \nmost basic of rights--renewing a drivers license, boarding an airplane \nor picking up documents at a government building--he or she is often \nsubject to a thorough search of his or her person and property. Even \nthe street in front of the White House--the people's house--has been \nclosed and street traffic rerouted. Moreover, streets around the House, \nSenate and Capitol buildings have been blocked-off and barricaded. All \nof these measures have been done because of our heightened sense of \nvulnerability to terrorism. The humiliation and inconvenience that \nthese situations present are mitigated only by the American people's \nacquiescence and realization that such practices are unfortunately \nnecessary in today's world. But it does not have to be this way, and we \nmust not become accustomed to the threat of terrorism. To the extent \nthat we refuse to accept it, to the extent we refuse to be desensitized \nto violence, we will invigorate the will to fight it.\n  The most recent bombings in Israel have also had a direct impact on \nmy home State of Illinois. The celebration of the Jewish holiday of \npurim is traditionally one of the more colorful festivals in the city \nof Chicago. Children are dressed in costumes, friends exchange gifts \nand there is laughter and merriment. However, as events of yet another \nsuicide bombing in Israel unfolded, grief, anxiety and depression \nreplaced joy, laughter, and merriment.\n\n  The juxtaposition of bombs and purim provides a context for \nunderstanding how we can draw inspiration and strength from history. \nJust as the Jews in Ancient Persia responded to danger with prayer and \ncourageous action, so too must we. Mr. President, I, for one, am tired \nof lighting candles, attending memorial services and waiting for news \nof the next terrorist attack. It is time for us to be proactive and not \nmerely reactive. We must declare all-out war against terrorism and \nterrorist organizations and take the fight to them wherever they \nexist--at home or abroad. We must make it clear to terrorists, their \norganizations, and the countries which sponsor and harbor terrorists \nthat their actions will not produce the desired result--the \ninterruption or abandonment of the peace process--and that the United \nStates and other nations will no longer permit their actions to go \nunpunished.\n  There must be a recognition, however, that terrorism cannot be \ndefeated through unilateral action alone. World leaders must understand \nthat it is in every country's interest to have this menace eradicated \nfrom the face of the Earth. Unless and until serious anti-terrorist \nactions are implemented internationally, including the denial of safe \nhaven and sanctuary for perpetrators of terrorism, we can expect more, \nnot fewer, incidents like we witnessed in Israel these past 2 weeks.\n  Mr. President, we, the inhabitants of this planet, are one family. \nWhile differences and disputes are unavoidable, I believe all problems, \nno matter how intractable they may seem, are soluble. Peace and \nnegotiations are not just the answer--they are the only answer.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/04/17/senate-section/article/S3495-1", "month": "04", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "17", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3496]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           GENE R.

Mr. President, I wanted to take a few minutes to \ntalk about the tax burden that American families feel today and the \ndrastic need for fundamental and comprehensive reform of our Tax Code.\n  During our brief break from legislative business over the past 2 \nweeks, I had the opportunity to visit with constituents in various \ncommunities in my State to discuss the effects of Federal tax policies \non families. Quite clearly, the tax burden over the past few decades \nhas greatly increased; the inequities of the Code have been \nexacerbated; and the incentives for savings have largely diminished. If \nit was anything that I heard during the course of nine town meetings, \nit was the demand for a fairer, simpler tax system and an even greater \ndemand by taxpayers to keep more of what they earn.\n  As a Member of the House of Representatives, I served on the Ways and \nMeans Committee, which has jurisdiction over tax legislation. I \nrecognize that our current system of taxation is burdensome and \nintrusive, and I think we are all aware how complex our system is, \ngiven the large amount of time Americans spend in computing and filing \ntheir taxes each year.\n  On Monday, I had the pleasure of traveling through Pennsylvania with \nSenator Specter, along with our Governor, Tom Ridge, as we hosted the \ndistinguished majority leader, Senator Bob Dole. The significance of \ntraveling across my State on tax day brings with it a renewed \ncommitment to fight for Federal policies addressing and correcting not \nonly the many inequities in our system, but demanding a fundamental \nreexamination by this Congress of the Federal Tax Code as a whole.\n  I strongly believe that Congress must continue to explore \ncomprehensive simplification of our Tax Code. Several of my colleagues \nhave introduced legislation to institute various alternative tax \nsystems as well as proposals to provide varying degrees of tax relief \nto American families. To reaffirm this commitment to tax fairness, I am \npleased today to join Senator Dan Coats as a cosponsor of his \nlegislation to provide not only for middle-class tax relief, but also \nto encourage increased personal investment and savings while balancing \nthe growth of Federal spending in general.\n  This Congress, as a direct result of the Republican majority, has \ncome as close as a veto pen to enacting tax fairness for American \nfamilies--fairness and relief that many would have realized in \npreparing their tax returns by Monday evening's filing deadline. A year \nafter the political battle over tax relief and a year later on tax day, \nthe same challenges and needs remain in devising a tax structure that \nprovides greater balance, incentives, and benefits to American families \nand taxpayers. These next few weeks in the Senate are critical and \nserve as another opportunity to readdress, pass, and finally enact \nthese changes.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/04/17/senate-section/article/S3496-2", "month": "04", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "17", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3496-S3498]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      HONORING BRIAN PALMER HAFLER\n\n Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I would like to take a few moments \nto acknowledge a very talented and promising resident of Massachusetts, \nBrian Palmer Hafler. Brian was chosen as a seventh place winner in the \nprestigious Westinghouse Science Talent Search, a national competition \nthat recognizes the outstanding math and science achievements of high \nschool students aged 16 to 18. Brian was recognized for his research \ninvolving T cells, research that may be instrumental in the future \ntreatment of autoimmune diseases.\n  After graduation from the Roxbury Latin School, West Roxbury, MA, \nBrian intends to continue his scientific research as a molecular \nbiology student at Princeton University. In addition to his scholarly \naccomplishments, Brian has won varsity letters in wrestling and cross \ncountry, numerous academic awards, and a service award for his work in \ntutoring inner-city students.\n  I applaud Brian on receiving the Westinghouse Science Award, and wish \nhim success in his future endeavors.\n\n[[Page S3497]]\n\n\n\n                      TESTIMONY OF JONATHAN KOZOL\n\n  Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, I had a chance to read the testimony of \nJonathan Kozol, an author who prods our conscience, before the House \nCommittee on Economic and Educational Opportunities, which I ask to be \nprinted in the Record after my remarks.\n  It is a summary of where we are, as he points out, on this year that \ncelebrates the 100th anniversary of the unfortunate Plessy v. Ferguson \ndecision.\n  The need to do a better job, the need to show care, the need to \ncreate opportunity for everyone is here. The question is whether we \nwill pay attention to this obvious need or whether we will ignore it, \nultimately at our own peril.\n  The article follows:\n\n  Committee on Economic and Educational Opportunities--U.S. House of \n                     Representatives, March 5, 1996\n\n\n                      testimony of jonathan kozol\n\n       Mr. Chairman: As you know, this year commemorates the 100th \n     anniversary of Plessy versus Ferguson, but few of the poorest \n     children in our nation will find much to celebrate. Public \n     schools throughout the land, with rare exceptions, are still \n     separate and unequal.\n       In New York City, to take only one example, public schools \n     for poor black and Hispanic children are nearly as segregated \n     as the schools of Mississippi 50 years ago. The city spends \n     less than half as much per-pupil as its richest suburbs--a \n     differential found, of course, all over the United States.\n       For many years, the only force that helped consistently to \n     militate against these inequalities has been the Federal \n     government. Although Federal money represents only a tiny \n     fraction of the total education budget in our nation, it has \n     been targeted at schools and neighborhoods in greatest need; \n     and, while Federal aid may represent, on average, only 6 \n     percent of local education budgets, it represents as much as \n     20 percent in our low-income districts.\n       Now, as the dismantling of Federal aid is being \n     contemplated, as block grants are proposed as substitutes for \n     targeted assistance to the poor, the plight of children in \n     the most impoverished districts will inevitably worsen.\n       I remind you also of the gross and cumulative deterioration \n     of schoolbuildings in low-income neighborhoods. ``Deferred \n     maintenance''--an antiseptic term which means that water \n     buckets must be scattered around classrooms to collect the \n     rain that penetrates a hundred-year-old roof, while hallways \n     stink of urine from the antiquated plumbing in the bathrooms \n     of a school--is well above $100 billion.\n       Conditions like these do not just soil bodies. They also \n     dirty souls and spirits, and they give our children a clear \n     message. They tell them that, no matter what we say about \n     ``high expectations,'' no matter what exhaustive lists of \n     ``goals'' and ``standards'' we keep churning out for the \n     millennium, the deepdown truth is that we do not like them \n     very much, nor value their potential as Americans.\n       Millions of children are going to class each day in \n     buildings none of you would be prepared to work in for one \n     hour. All the boosterism in the world, all the hype and all \n     the exhortation, all the upbeat speeches by a visiting \n     politician telling kids, ``You are somebody,'' has no \n     palpable effect if every single thing about the school \n     itself--its peeling paint, its rotting walls, its stinking \n     corridors, its crowded, makeshift classrooms in coat closets, \n     on stair-landings, and in squalid corners of the basement--\n     tells our children, ``In the eyes of this society, you are \n     not anyone at all.''\n       The notion of ``retrofitting'' schools like these for the \n     computer age has something of the quality of a Grimms fairy \n     tale. How will a school that can't repair the toilets or \n     afford to pay for toilet-paper find the money to buy IBM or \n     Microsoft? The gulf between the national ``goals'' and the \n     degrading day-to-day reality of life for children in these \n     schools has something about it that suggests delusionary \n     thinking. There is simply no connection between slogans and \n     realities.\n       Despite all this, we face the strange phenomenon of being \n     asked repeatedly, by those who spend as much as $20,000 \n     yearly to enroll their children in exclusive private schools, \n     whether money really matters when it comes to education of \n     the poor. ``Can you solve these kinds of problems,'' we are \n     asked, ``by throwing money at them?''\n       I always find this a strange question, but especially when \n     it is asked by those who do precisely this for their own \n     children. Money cannot do everything in life. It can't buy \n     decency. It obviously does not buy honesty or generosity of \n     spirit. But, if the goal is to repair a roof or to install a \n     wiring system or remove lead poison or to pay for a computer, \n     or persuade a first-rate teacher to remain in a tough job, I \n     think money is a fine solution.\n       A rhetorical devise used by some politicians points to \n     unusual districts such as Washington DC, or East St. Louis, \n     Illinois, that spend a bit more money than some of the nearby \n     districts but do poorly by comparison. This, we are told, is \n     proof that ``money does not matter.'' But, in most cases, \n     there are districts that also plagued by pediatric illness \n     like chronic asthma, by lead-poisoning, by astronomic rates \n     of AIDS, and joblessness, and drug-addiction, and a global \n     feeling of despair. Equality, as Dr. King reminded us, does \n     not mean equal funding for unequal needs. It means resources \n     commensurate with the conditions of existence.\n       It is true that there has been anarchic inefficiency in \n     certain urban districts; this needs to be addressed. But even \n     where efficiency has been restored, as in Chicago for \n     example, funds are not forthcoming. Still we are told to \n     ``cut the fat'' from the administration. But in New York, as \n     in Chicago, there is no more fat to cut. We are now cutting \n     at the bone and at the hearts of children.\n       And so we come at last to 1996 and to the present moment in \n     the U.S. Congress, where the forces of reaction tell us it is \n     time to ``get tough'' with poor children. How much tougher do \n     we dare to get? How cold, as a society, are we prepared to \n     be?\n       New York City, as things stand right now, can barely eke \n     out $7,000 yearly for the education of a first grade child in \n     a school I've visited in the South Bronx, but is spending \n     $70,000 yearly on each child it incarcerates--$60,000 on \n     each adult. If Title I is slashed by Congress, it will \n     devastate the children in this school. In the 1980s, these \n     impoverished children lost the dental clinic in their \n     building. A year ago, they lost the afternoon program \n     where they could be safe in school while mothers worked or \n     looked for jobs. This June, their teen-age siblings will \n     lose summer jobs as Congress lets that program die as \n     well. Only 10 percent of these children are admitted into \n     Head Start programs. The one place to which they are sure \n     of being readily admitted is the city's prison island--now \n     the largest penal colony on earth.\n       Beyond the cutbacks, there is one more shadow looming, and \n     that is the everpresent threat of education vouchers--a \n     modernized version of a hated memory from 40 years ago, when \n     Southern whites fled from the public schools after the Brown \n     decision, seeking often to get public funds to subsidize \n     their so-called ``white academies.'' They didn't succeed in \n     this attempt, but now another generation--more sophisticated \n     and more clever in concealing racial animus--is driving \n     toward the same objective by the instrument of vouchers.\n       This time, they are smart enough to offer vouchers to black \n     children and poor children too, but the vouchers they propose \n     can never pay for full tuition at a first-rate private school \n     and, in effect, will simply filter off ``the least poor of \n     the poor'' who can enhance the voucher with sufficient funds \n     to flee into small private sanctuaries that exclude their \n     poorest neighbors. By filtering off these families from the \n     common areas of shared democracy, we will leave behind a \n     pedagogic wasteland in which no good teacher will desire to \n     teach but where the masses of poor children will remain in \n     buildings that are schools only in name. We are getting close \n     to that point even now. Vouchers, combined with further \n     fiscal cuts, will bring that day considerably nearer.\n       Some of us who stand up to defend the public schools may \n     seem, at first, to be in an untenable position: We give the \n     appearance of not wanting to change while pointing to how bad \n     things are today. This is our fault, I think, because we tend \n     to speak defensively about the status quo, and fail to offer \n     a more sweeping vision for the future. We scramble to save \n     Title I--and so we should. But Title I, essential as it is, \n     is a remedial side-dish on the table of inequity. We should \n     be speaking of the main course, but have largely failed to do \n     so.\n       Our vision ought to be to build a public system that is so \n     superb, so democratic, and well-run, that no responsible or \n     thoughtful parent would desire to abandon it. To bring this \n     vision to fruition, we would have to raise the banner of \n     efficiency as high as any voucher advocate has done. We \n     cannot defend dysfunction on the grounds that it is somehow \n     one of the inevitable corollaries of democracy. But simply to \n     support ``efficiency'' or to encourage innovations such as \n     charter schools is not nearly enough. Innovative and \n     efficient inequality is still unworthy of America. We also \n     need to raise a bolder banner, one that cries out for an end \n     to gross inequity, one that uses strong word for the savagery \n     of what we do today: providing college preparation for the \n     fortunate, bottom-level-labor preparation for the lower-\n     middle class, and prison preparation for our outcasts.\n       None of my respected friends here in the House of \n     Representatives believes that it is fair to rig the game of \n     life the way we do. We wouldn't play Little League like \n     this. We'd be ashamed. Our victories would seem \n     contaminated. Why aren't we saying this in words Americans \n     can hear?\n       There is too much silence on this issue among Democrats. It \n     leaves the field to those who speak bombastically, with \n     violence of spirit, as they swiftly mount their juggernaut of \n     cutbacks, vouchers, and secession from the public realm. \n     Virulent racism, as we know too well, is often just beneath \n     the surface of discussion too. I heard few voices in the \n     Congress that address this boldly. There is a sense of quiet \n     abdication and surrender.\n       Despite my feeling of discouragement, I would like to add \n     that I was reassured to see that Secretary Riley spoke out \n     clearly on the voucher issue recently. As always, he was \n     eloquence and fearless. The same eloquence and the same \n     fearlessness are needed now among the Democrats in Congress. \n     Some of those Democrats, whom I have had the privilege to \n     know for many years, will be retiring soon. Before they do, I \n     hope that\n\n[[Page S3498]]\n\n     they will find the opportunity to wage one final battle for \n     those children who cannot fight for themselves. I hope they \n     won't leave Congress quietly, but with an angry sword held \n     high. In that way, even if they lose this battle, they will \n     leave behind a legacy of courage that a future generation can \n     uphold with pride.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/04/17/senate-section/article/S3496-3", "month": "04", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "17", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3498]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             BURTON MOSELEY\n\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN.

Mr. President, people are concerned about what is \nhappening to our country and they are not simply concerned about \neconomics. They are concerned about many issues that reflect our \nculture in ways that are not healthy.\n  E.J. Dionne, Jr., one of the most thoughtful journalistic observers \nof our scene, recently had a column in the Washington Post titled, \n``Split Over Morality,'' which I ask to be printed in the Record after \nmy remarks.\n  For those of you who saw it originally in the Post, it is worth \nrereading, and for those who did not, it should be read and clipped and \nsaved.\n  The column follows:\n\n                          Split Over Morality\n\n                         (By E. J. Dionne, Jr.)\n\n       It is remarkable how quickly political talk these days \n     turns to the question: What does the religious right want? \n     Variations on the theme include: How much must Bob Dole do to \n     get the votes of Christian conservatives? Can't President \n     Clinton help himself by hanging the religious right around \n     Dole's neck?\n       All this might be taken as a great victory by Ralph Reed \n     and the Christian Coalition he directs. The obituary of the \n     religious right has been written over and over since the rise \n     of the Moral Majority in 1980. Yet none of this has stopped \n     the Christian conservative movement from expanding its \n     influence.\n       Reed and his troops have already gotten a lot of credit for \n     help Dole stop Pat Buchanan's surge dead in the South \n     Carolina primary. That is the very definition of political \n     power.\n       Reed and his followers have every right to do what they are \n     doing. Religious people have the same rights as union \n     members, environmentalists, business groups and feminists. \n     President Clinton himself has spoken at hundreds of black \n     churches. The president is often at his most effective from \n     the pulpit, an exceptionally good venue for his favorite \n     speeches about the links between personal responsibility and \n     social justice, crime and unemployment.\n       Democrats thus have no grounds for challenging Reed's \n     argument that his people deserve ``a place at the table'' of \n     national politics. What does need real debate is more \n     important. It has to do with how moral issues should be \n     discussed in politics, and also how they should be defined.\n       A lot of Americans--including many who want nothing to do \n     with Ralph Reed--have a vague but strong sense that what's \n     going wrong in American life is not just about economics. It \n     also entails an ethical or moral crisis. Evidence for this is \n     adduced from family breakdown, teen pregnancy, high crime \n     rates (especially among teenagers), and trashy movies, \n     television and music.\n       But unlike many on the Christian Right, these same \n     Americans see strong links between moral and economic issues. \n     Their sense that commitments are not being honored includes \n     family commitments, but it also includes the obligations \n     between employer and employee and the question of whether \n     those ``who work hard and play by the rules,'' as the \n     president likes to put it, are getting just treatment.\n       Democrats, liberals and other assorted critics of the \n     religious right have no problem in discussing these economic \n     matters. But they have made the reverse mistake of Reed and \n     his friends: The religious right's foes have only rarely (and \n     only relatively recently) been willing to understand that \n     many American families see the moral crisis whole. It's \n     possible, and reasonable, to be worried about both trashy \n     entertainment and the rewards that go to the hard-working. \n     Human beings are both economic and moral creatures. But \n     liberals often cringe when the word ``morality'' is even \n     mentioned.\n       Giving the Christian right a near monopoly on moral \n     discussion has narrowed the moral debate. This narrowing \n     needs to be challenged.\n       To hear leaders of the religious right talk in recent \n     weeks, for example, one of the preeminent moral issues of our \n     time is whether gay marriages should be sanctioned by state \n     or local governments. But surely this is not even the 10th or \n     the 25th most important issue for most Americans. The \n     resolution of this question one way or the other will do \n     virtually nothing about the moral issues such as crime or \n     family breakup that actually do trouble lots of people.\n       It's easy enough to recognize why tradition-minded \n     Americans are uneasy with this broadening of the definition \n     of ``marriage.'' But turning this question into yet another \n     political litmus test will only push the political debate \n     toward yet another ugly round of gay-bashing. Is that what \n     1996 should be about?\n       What needs to be fought is a tendency described movingly by \n     Stephen Carter in his new book, ``Integrity.'' It is a \n     tendency Carter quite fairly discerns all across the \n     political discussion.\n       ``I must confess that the great political movements of our \n     day frighten me with their reckless certainties and their \n     insistence on treating people as means to be manipulated \n     rather than as the ends for which government exists,'' he \n     writes. ``Too many partisans seems to hate their opponents, \n     who are demonized in terms so creative that I weep at the \n     waste of energy, and, as one who struggles to be a Christian, \n     I find the hatred painful.'' So would we all.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/04/17/senate-section/article/S3498-2", "month": "04", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "17", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3498]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            WEST VIRGINIA WESTINGHOUSE SCIENCE TALENT SEARCH\n\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER.

Gen. Patrick M. Hughes, and it could signal an effort \n     by the Defense Department to distance itself from blame if \n     the civil war resumes shortly after the NATO withdrawal.\n       General Hughes, the director the Defense Intelligence \n     Agency, offered reassuring words in his report for American \n     troops stationed in Bosnia, suggesting that NATO forces face \n     no organized military threat. If the war resumes, he said, it \n     will not be until after the American peacekeepers and their \n     NATO allies have pulled out.\n       But the report, dated Feb. 22, offered no similar solace \n     for the people of Bosnia. General Hughes said that the \n     ``prospects for the existence of a viable, unitary Bosnia \n     beyond the life'' of the NATO deployment are ``dim'' without \n     a large international program to revive Bosnia's war-\n     shattered economy.\n       If his assessment is accurate, the peace effort in Bosnia \n     could well be doomed, since the civilian reconstruction \n     effort there is barely under way, its economy and physical \n     infrastructure--roads, water and electricity lines, \n     telephones--still in ruins. The last American soldiers are \n     scheduled to withdraw from Bosnia in December.\n       General Hughes said that the strategic goals of the warring \n     factions in the region ``have not fundamentally changed'' \n     since the days of the civil war and that tensions among them \n     would probably grow in the months leading up to the NATO \n     pullout.\n       If that is true, the Clinton Administration might come \n     under intense pressure from its NATO allies not to withdraw \n     American troops by the end of December--a deadline that the \n     Administration insists it will hold to.\n       The Pentagon assessment also implicity questions basic \n     elements of the American-brokered Dayton peace agreement, \n     which laid out what critics in Congress called unrealistic \n     deadlines for political and economic reconstruction in Bosnia \n     and for the withdrawal of peace-keeping troops.\n       ``There's only so much our soldiers can accomplish,'' said \n     another senior Defense Department official, echoing the \n     report's central findings, ``The military forces agreed to \n     keep the peace for a year, and that's what we're doing. But \n     this peace will not hold without an effort to rebuild the \n     country. That's not being done yet. And that's not our job.''\n       The job of organizing the economic and political \n     reconstruction of Bosnia has been left to a European \n     delegation led by Carl Bildt, a former Swedish Prime \n     Minister.\n       But Mr. Bildt has complained repeatedly in recent months \n     that foreign governments have been slow to make available the \n     billions of dollars needed for civilian reconstruction--\n     everything from building bridges to printing election \n     ballots--and that the political component of the peace effort \n     is lagging far behind its military component. In a meeting \n     this month with donor countries, he pleaded that the donors \n     ``do more to honor the pledges we have made.''\n       While questioning whether Bosnia was about to dissolve once \n     again into civil war, General Hughes said in his report that \n     ``in the short term, we are optimistic'' about the situation \n     faced by the 18,400 American soldiers stationed there as part \n     of the peace-keeping force.\n       ``We believe that the former warring factions will continue \n     to generally comply with the military aspects'' of the peace \n     accord, the report said. ``We do not expect U.S. or allied \n     forces to be confronted by organized military resistance.''\n       The threat faced by the American forces would come instead \n     from land mines ``and from various forms of random, sporadic \n     low-level violence,'' the report said. ``This could include \n     high-profile attacks by rogue elements or terrorists.'' So \n     far only one American soldier has been killed in Bosnia, an \n     Army sergeant who was killed in an explosion on Feb. 3 as he \n     tried to defuse a land mine.\n       The report suggested that if the civil war resumes, it will \n     flare up only after the NATO forces have pulled out, removing \n     the buffer that has kept the factions at peace for most of \n     the last four months.\n       ``The overall strategic political goals of the former \n     warring factions have not fundamentally changed,'' General \n     Hughes said. ``Without a concerted effort by the \n     international community, including substantial progress in \n     the civil sector to restore economic viability and to provide \n     for conditions in which national (federation) political \n     stability can be achieved, the prospects for the existence of \n     a viable, unitary Bosnia beyond the life of IFOR are dim.'' \n     The NATO forces in Bosnia are known as the Implementation \n     Force, or IFOR.\n       General Hughes suggested that all of the fragile alliances \n     created by the peace accord might collapse--with tensions \n     between the Bosnian Muslims and Bosnian Croats threatening \n     their federation, with the Bosnian Croats working toward ``de \n     facto integration'' with Croatia, and with elections and the \n     resettlement of refugees ``delayed or stymied.''\n       He said that the Bosnian Serbs were likely to consolidate \n     their hold on their own territory, seeking ``some form of \n     political confederation'' with Serbia.\n       Questions about whether any peace in Bosnia would outlast \n     the presence of NATO troops--and whether American troops \n     would be stuck there as a result--were at the heart of the \n     debate in Congress that preceded votes to authorize the \n     American military deployment. Senator Bob Dole, the front-\n     runner for the Republican Presidential nomination, demanded \n     and won an Administration pledge to play a role in arming and \n     training the Bosnian Government's army.\n       The assessment by the Defense Intelligence Agency is only \n     slightly more pessimistic than remarks heard elsewhere in the \n     Pentagon. Senior Defense Department officials have long \n     warned that the peace would fail without a huge effort to \n     rebuild Bosnia and to give the people some hope of economic \n     and political stability after years of slaughter.\n       ``Ultimately I think the bigger problem is not the military \n     implementation of the peace agreement,'' Gen. John \n     Shalikasvili, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, told \n     the House National Security Committee this month. ``We need \n     to make sure we understand that it is equally important to \n     the overall effort--and also the safety of the troops--that \n     we get on with the civilian functions that need to be \n     performed.''\n       ``And when I say `we,' I don't mean the military, but the \n     nations that are involved in this effort,'' he added.\n       ``The elections have to go forward, the refugees have to \n     begin to return, reconstruction has to start, the \n     infrastructure has to be rebuilt so that the people in the \n     country can see an advantage to not fighting.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/04/17/senate-section/article/S3498-4", "month": "04", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "17", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3499]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 MEASURE PLACED ON CALENDAR--H.R. 2337\n\n  Mr. SPECTER.

Mr. President, on April 2, on behalf of the Senate \nIntelligence Committee, I traveled to Paris and then to The Hague, \nwhere I consulted with the prosecution teams of the war crimes tribunal \nto assess their progress. Then, on April 3, on to Belgrade April 4, \nthen to Tuzla, and back to Paris on the evening of April 4.\n  While in Paris, I had the opportunity to observe the operation of the \nParis Embassy, under the direction of Ambassador Pamela Harriman. I was \nvery much impressed with what I saw of the operation there. Ambassador \nHarriman conducts a large Embassy. Really, Paris is the crossroads of \nthe European continent. There are many complex issues that confront the \nEmbassy involving security matters with NATO, involving commercial \nmatters, involving activities that touch upon the operation of the \nSenate Intelligence Committee and the Central Intelligence Agency. I \nwas very much impressed with those operations.\n  During the course of my discussions with Ambassador Harriman, I \ndiscussed with her the cuts in the budget of the State Department in \nthe so-called 150 Account. And from the work I have done on the \nAppropriations Committee, and in the past having been on the \nsubcommittee with jurisdiction over the Department of State, it is my \nsense that the cuts that have been imposed are excessive.\n  I asked Ambassador Harriman to prepare for me a list of specifics, \nwhich she has done, entitled ``Disinvesting in Diplomacy,'' pointing \nout how hard hit large Embassies will be, like the Embassy in Paris, \nand with the specification of the cuts and the impact of those cuts on \nher operation. I was especially impressed with one of her offices, from \nwhich 17 officers had been cut, under last year's reduction, to 12, and \nif the anticipated cuts are put into effect for next year, down to 7.\n  Mr. President, at the conclusion of my remarks, I ask unanimous \nconsent that the specification under the caption ``Divesting in \nDiplomacy'' be printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Ashcroft). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, while in Paris, and at the Embassy on the \nevening of April 2, I visited with Secretary of Commerce Ron Brown for \nwhom a reception was held in his honor along with the Secretary of \nLabor Robert Reich.\n  As we all know, on the very next day Secretary Brown and his company \nmet their untimely deaths with the crash of their plane making a \nlanding approach into Sarajevo.\n  When Secretary Brown and I spoke on the evening of April 2 at about \n6:45 he was robust, enthusiastic, and very anxious to carry out his \nresponsibilities as Secretary of Commerce. He had brought with him a \ngroup of United States businessmen who could be instrumental in the \nrebuilding and the revitalization of Bosnia.\n  It is well accepted that, if the peace in Bosnia is to stay and is to \nhold, there will have to be a buildup of the infrastructure there, and \nSecretary Brown was there in connection with those duties. He and I \ntalked about meeting in Sarajevo or Zagreb. But that meeting \nunfortunately did not take place. The next morning I departed for \nSerbia, was in Belgrade, and had a plane on April 3 to travel to \nSarajevo. That plane was canceled because of weather. We did not go to \nSarajevo, and the same weather conditions resulted in the fatal crash \nof Secretary Brown and his company.\n  I traveled the next day to Tuzla, arrived there early in the morning, \nwas met by General Cherry, and we immediately talked about Secretary \nBrown's visit the preceding day. Secretary Brown had arrived at 6:40 \na.m. on April 3 and visited the United States military establishment in \nTuzla, and departed at 1:58 p.m. And then, as we know, shortly \nthereafter the fatal crash occurred on the approach to the landing in \nDubrovnik.\n  Secretary Brown was certainly a stalwart advocate of U.S. interests, \nand his loss will be deeply felt by the U.S. Government. On behalf of \nmy wife Joan, I want to convey our deepest sympathies and condolences \nto Ron's wife, Alma, and their two children, Michael and Tracey, and \nthe rest of their family.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n                       Disinvesting in Diplomacy\n\n       Large projected cuts in the 150 account will hamper our \n     ability to attain U.S. economic, security and political \n     objectives worldwide for many years to come.\n       Among the hardest-hit will be our large embassies in \n     Western Europe. These Embassies protect and promote vital \n     U.S. interests. Western Europe is home to most of our biggest \n     and most powerful trading and investment partners. NATO is \n     our most important military alliance.\n       Our European allies share our democratic ideals and are \n     willing to join us in coalitions to promote global stability. \n     A few, such as France, have global military, economic, \n     technological and commercial interests which parallel our \n     own. In France, our diplomacy reaches well beyond bilateral \n     relations to include cooperation and burdensharing on a broad \n     range of global issues.\n       Embassy Paris, like most other major Embassies, is cutting \n     back sharply its operations while trying to economize. The \n     consulate in Lyon was closed in 1992. In 1996, the Bordeaux \n     consulate also had to be closed. The latter had been in \n     operation since George Washington's Presidency.\n       In 1996, the Embassy was required to close its travel and \n     tourism office. Its ten person staff, which was handling \n     100,000 requests for information annually from potential \n     foreign visitors to the U.S., was eliminated. The calls will \n     have to be absorbed or redirected with no increase in staff.\n       In the past two years, Embassy Paris has cut the operating \n     hours of its communication center by 65 percent. A hiring \n     freeze has been in place for four years, and the Embassy's \n     French work force has not received a pay increase in three \n     years. Twenty-five French employee positions have been marked \n     for elimination. The list of other reductions is long.\n       In view of these reduced resources, Embassy Paris is making \n     a concerted effort to ``work smarter'' with fewer resources. \n     It has formed ``teams'' to pool interagency assets more \n     effectively. It has negotiated savings of $3,000,000 over \n     five years in local service contracts. It instituted a new \n     interactive automated telephone service for visa applicants \n     which generates $8,000 to $10,000/month in revenues. A \n     consolidation of warehouses is saving $400,000 per years. A \n     new computerized pass and ID system allowed the Embassy to \n     cut 10 Marine guards.\n       This kind of innovation has allowed cuts to be distributed \n     and absorbed within the Embassy without drastic cutbacks in \n     services thus far. However, this is now likely to change.\n       The State Department is calling for another round of deep \n     personnel cuts. For Paris, this would entail a 43 percent \n     drop in core diplomatic personnel in the 1995 to 1998 period. \n     Reductions this large will impact heavily on core diplomatic \n     strengths and the Embassy's effectiveness. Some of the \n     effects will be:\n       Advocacy for U.S. trade and business interests will be \n     reduced in frequency and effectiveness (recent investment \n     problems handled by the Embassy included U.S. firms in the \n     food processing, pharmaceutical and information industries).\n       The loss of the Embassy's ability to monitor the Paris \n     Club, the organization which negotiates debt rescheduling \n     affecting billions owed the USG by developing countries.\n       A 50 percent reduction in contacts with the key French \n     officials we must reach if we are to influence French policy \n     and advocate U.S. positions on questions of vital interest to \n     us.\n       Closure of the Science office at a time when our \n     cooperative exchanges with France on nuclear, space and \n     health technology matters (to mention only three) should be \n     growing rapidly.\n       Significant cutbacks and slowdowns in passport and welfare \n     services to U.S. citizens. Passport issuance will take 3 to 5 \n     days instead of one. Prison visits will be cut to one per \n     year. Consuls will no longer attend trials of U.S. citizens. \n     The consulate will be open to the public for only two hours \n     per day.\n       A 60 percent reduction in State Department reporting from \n     Paris, including the political and economic analysis we need \n     on France's activities in Europe, Africa and the Middle East, \n     and Asia.\n       These trends are disturbing and merit closer attention. The \n     Administration and Congress must work together to assess \n     carefully how budgetary and personnel cutbacks affect our \n     core diplomatic capabilities in Western Europe and elsewhere. \n     This is especially true at a moment when business and \n     information is globalizing and our national interests dictate \n     that we be even more intensively engaged with our key allies \n     than in the past.\n\n  (The remarks of Mr. Specter pertaining to the submission of Senate \nResolution 247 are printed in today's Record under ``Submission of \nConcurrent and Senate Resolutions.'')\n  (The remarks of Mr. Specter pertaining to the introduction of S. 1681 \nare located in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced Bills \nand Joint Resolutions.'')\n  Mr. SPECTER.
