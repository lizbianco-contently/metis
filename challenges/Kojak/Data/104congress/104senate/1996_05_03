Mr. President, President Clinton, as a candidate, told \nthe American people that once in office, he would lower taxes--lower \ntaxes--on the American middle class.\n  Three years later, as we stand here, the cost to the typical family \nhas risen in higher taxes and lower earnings under President Clinton's \nadministration by $2,600 per family.\n  It was President Clinton who said, ``I oppose Federal excise gas \ntaxes.'' That is in his ``Putting People First,'' Clinton's 1992 \ncampaign book.\n  Here is another quote from President Clinton: ``It sticks it to the \nlower income and middle-income retired people in the country, and it's \nwrong.''\n\n  That is candidate Bill Clinton on Paul Tsongas' proposal for a gas \ntax increase.\n  Today, as we all know, President Clinton proposed and forced and \nenacted by a 1-vote margin in the Senate a new gas tax which adds 4.3 \ncents on every gallon of gasoline. I believe most\n\n[[Page S4654]]\n\nof us remember that when we were debating that tax, for which no one on \nthis side of the aisle voted, we were told that the tax increase would \nonly apply to the wealthy. I am sure that everybody who pulls up at \nthat gas pump once or twice a week and sees that little ticker going \noff at 4.3 cents per gallon probably does not consider themselves among \nthe wealthy. In fact, the lower income population of our country \ndedicates 7 percent of their wages to the purchase of gasoline.\n  So it is an inordinate burden on middle- and lower income Americans. \nI read it again: ``It sticks it to the lower income and middle-income \nretired people in the country, and it's wrong.'' That is candidate Bill \nClinton.\n  But every American who goes to a gasoline pump understands what \nPresident Bill Clinton did. He raised gas taxes on every family, every \ncitizen, every business and every community, and they are all suffering \nfrom these new taxes.\n  They ought to be repealed. The gas tax should be repealed as another \nstep of lowering the economic burden on the American working family and \nthe American working business.\n  Mr. President, I yield up to 10 minutes to the distinguished Senator \nfrom Minnesota.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Stevens). The Senator from Minnesota is \nrecognized for 10 minutes.\n  Mr. GRAMS. Thank you very much, Mr. President, and I thank the \nSenator from Georgia.\n  Mr. President, Webster's dictionary defines freedom as ``the quality \nor state of being free; the absence of necessity, coercion, or \nconstraint in choice or action.''\n  That is the dictionary definition anyway. But how do Americans define \nfreedom for themselves and their families?\n  For most of us, freedom means the ability to make our own choices--\nbasic decisions like where we are going to live, what kind of job we \nare going to have, where we would like our children to go to school, \nand how we want to raise them. And in a free society like ours, freedom \ncertainly has to include controlling our own finances.\n  But does it?\n  American families feel like they are being stripped of their \nfinancial freedom. There is strong evidence to back that up. And you \ncan blame it on taxes.\n  Each year, the nonpartisan Tax Foundation calculates Tax Freedom Day.\n  That is the day on which Americans stop working just to pay their \nState, Federal, and local taxes and actually begin keeping their \nearnings for themselves or for their families.\n  In 1925, Tax Freedom Day arrived on February 6. But this year, New \nYear's Day, Groundhog Day, Valentine's Day, President's Day, St. \nPatrick's Day--Earth Day and Arbor Day, as well--will all have come and \ngone before Americans get to keep the first dime of their own money on \nMay 7.\n  At 128 days into the year, 1996 marks Tax Freedom Day's latest \narrival ever. In fact, Tax Freedom Day has jumped ahead an entire week \nsince President Clinton took office, because under Bill Clinton's \nwatch, the Government is taking more from the paychecks of middle-class \nAmericans than ever before.\n  Today, the typical American family faces a total tax burden of 38 \npercent. Taxpayers are turning more money over to the Government than \nthey are spending for their family's food, clothing, shelter, and \ntransportation combined.\n  The news is even more discouraging for the taxpayers of Minnesota, my \nhome State. Because of higher State and local tax rates and differences \nin the Federal tax burden, Minnesota is tied with Wisconsin in having \nthe fourth-latest Tax Freedom Day in the Nation.\n  Minnesotans will not begin keeping their own dollars until May 15, \nfully 8 days later than the national average. Only the residents of \nConnecticut, New York, and New Jersey pay higher taxes than we \nMinnesotans.\n  By imposing his record-breaking, $265 billion tax increase in 1993, \nPresident Clinton bears the responsibility for the ever-increasing tax \nburden on Americans.\n  From singles, to families, to seniors, to job-providers, every \nsegment of society has felt the pinch. Motorists were hit especially \nhard by the President's gas tax increase, which has boosted the cost of \ngasoline by nearly $5 billion every year.\n  Whatever you call it--the ``Clinton crunch'' or the ``middle-class \nsqueeze''--as long as taxes keep rising, the dollars Americans have \nleft over to provide for their families will keep falling.\n  And so it should be the goal of Congress and the President to help \nAmericans earn more money, and keep more of the money they earn, so \nthey can do more for themselves, their kids, their communities, their \nchurches.\n  If Washington wants to ensure that Tax Freedom Day arrives earlier \nnext year, there are four important steps we'll have to take.\n  No. 1. Cut taxes for working families.\n  Tax-cutting ideas like the $500-per child tax credit, elimination of \nthe marriage penalty, adoption and eldercare tax credits, and tax \nincentives designed to create jobs and boost salaries, were the \ncenterpiece of the balanced budget plan passed by Congress last year. \nThat was the same balanced budget vetoed by the President. He does not \nseem to understand what you and I and the American people already know: \ncutting taxes is the single-most valuable way Washington can give \nfamilies back control of their own dollars.\n  And the first tax we are going to roll back is the Clinton gas tax \nincrease. It comes at a time when hard-working Americans are feeling \nanxious and worried about making ends meet. Congress must not rest \nuntil President Clinton has signed our tax relief into law.\n  No. 2. Make it harder for Washington to raise taxes.\n  It is easy for the Government to claim that compassion is fueling the \nbillions spent each year on its smorgasbord of expensive Federal \nprograms. But what the Government keeps forgetting is that its \ncompassion is funded by the tax dollars it takes from hard-working \nAmericans. If we are ever going to rein in big Government and wasteful \nspending, we must make it harder for the big spenders in Washington to \ntake more of the taxpayers' money through higher taxes. We have to make \nit more difficult.\n\n  My colleague from Arizona, Senator Jon Kyl, and I introduced a \nconstitutional amendment in February to require that any new tax, or \nexpansion of a current tax, be approved by the House and Senate by a \nthree-fifths supermajority vote, not the simple majority needed today. \nThe House recently debated a similar amendment--theirs required a two-\nthirds majority vote. Ten States have supermajority laws on the books, \nand taxes have actually dropped in those States by about 2 percent. \nTaxpayers elsewhere are dealing with a 2-percent increase in the taxes \nthey pay to government without that supermajority.\n  There have been 16 major votes in Congress over the last 30 years to \nincrease taxes. That is a new tax increase every 22 months on average--\napparently there has been no shame of going to the well of taxpayer \nmoney every time the big spenders in Washington wanted to spend more.\n  Many of those tax increases, however, passed by slim margins--\nincluding the one-vote margin approving President Clinton's 1993 \nincrease--and would not have been enacted at all if the three-fifths or \ntwo-thirds requirement had been in effect at that time.\n  No. 3. Educate the taxpayers about where their tax dollars are going.\n  Most people know that their Federal tax dollars fund the Social \nSecurity program, and Medicare. But beyond that, few give much thought \nas to how the rest of the $1.4 trillion the Government will collect in \ntaxes this year is spent.\n  For example, they probably would not think that some of the most \nsuccessful products in the world--products like Tyson chicken, \nMcDonald's hamburgers, and Gallo wine--would need to have their \nadvertising subsidized by the taxpayers.\n  Yet the Federal Government will spend 90 million tax dollars this \nyear promoting these and other household names overseas.\n  Would taxpayers guess that many of the Nation's wealthiest \ncommunities are taking tax dollars to build boating marinas and riding \ntrails?\n  Or that the Government runs 125 separate job-training programs at an \nannual cost of $16 billion--often training\n\n[[Page S4655]]\n\npeople for dead-end jobs, or jobs that do not exist?\n  The taxpayers have every right to feel ripped off.\n  But what should disturb them most is that in 1996, we are spending 15 \npercent of the Federal budget just to pay the interest on money we \nborrowed to finance expensive programs we could not afford in the first \nplace.\n  Mr. President, an educated taxpayer is the Washington establishment's \nworst enemy.\n  No. 4. Reform the tax system.\n  There are not many Americans who celebrate when April 15 rolls \naround. Not only are taxes too high, but people are frustrated by a tax \ncollection system that is too complicated, too big, and too unfair. As \nproof of just how massive the IRS has grown, consider that the FBI, the \nDrug Enforcement Agency, and the Border Patrol have a combined work \nforce of 36,600 employees, while the IRS itself carries 111,000 workers \non its payroll.\n  We need tax reform--a fairer, simpler, more sensible way to pay for \nthe services of Government. The National Commission on Economic Growth \nand Tax Reform recently outlined six goals for Congress to consider in \nreinventing our tax system to make it more responsive to the taxpayers:\n  First, fairness for all taxpayers; economic growth through incentives \nto work, save, and invest; simplicity, because the tax system should be \nless costly to manage, and everyone should be able to understand it; \nneutrality so that people, not Government, are making the choices; \nvisibility so that Americans know what they're getting for the taxes \nthey pay; and stability, to allow families more freedom to plan for \ntheir futures.\n  Mr. President, Tuesday, May 7--Tax Freedom Day--should be more than \njust another day for counting up the high cost of Government. We want \nto give back Americans control of their lives. We want to give \nAmericans their freedom.\n  Therefore, Washington can and must do better by the taxpayers. Mr. \nPresident, let us use Tax Freedom Day as a reminder of what freedom \nreally means to Americans, and just how important it is that we \ncontinue fighting for it on their behalf.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  Mr. COVERDELL addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, at this time I first want to thank the \nSenator from Minnesota. I yield up to 10 minutes to the distinguished \nSenator from South Dakota.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Dakota is recognized \nfor 10 minutes.\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Mr. President, I want to commend my friend from \nMinnesota, who speaks so eloquently on the issue of taxes. I follow his \nleadership and depend on it in this area. I want to continue on the \ntheme he has raised so eloquently here.\n  We must repeal the gas tax. It is hurting farmers, truckers, \ntourists, airlines. It seems that every time Washington wants to solve \na problem it passes an additional tax. It is with the belief that this \nwill somehow solve problems. But we can actually get more revenue into \nthe Federal Treasury by restraining certain types of taxes on \nproduction.\n  For example, in my State of South Dakota, if we could repeal the gas \ntax and make sure it went to consumers, we would be in the position \nthat our truckers would be better off who haul agricultural commodities \nto markets. It costs us about 50 cents a bushel to move our \nagricultural commodities to market. Our airlines would be better off, \nespecially with the tourism season.\n  Tourism is our No. 2 industry in South Dakota. I have in my hand an \narticle from today's USA Today, Friday, May 3, ``Rising Jet Fuel Tab \nMay Lead to Fare Hikes.'' If there are fare hikes, they will perhaps be \nthe highest in perhaps some of the nonhub airports. That will hit at \nthe heart of South Dakota's tourism season.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have the article ``Rising \nJet Fuel Tab May Lead to Fare Hikes'' printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                   [From the USA Today, May 3, 1996]\n\n               Rising Jet Fuel Tab May Lead to Fare Hikes\n\n                        (By Keith L. Alexander)\n\n       Soaring jet fuel prices are threatening travelers' budgets \n     and airlines' profits.\n       Jet fuel prices have increased an average 11 cents from a \n     year earlier, to 65 cents a gallon in April.\n       If sustained, the increase in jet fuel prices would \n     translate to more than $1.8 billion a year in higher costs \n     for airlines.\n       The industry worries that higher fuel prices could threaten \n     hopes for a second straight annual profit. The industry \n     earned $2.4 billion last year, its first profitable year \n     since 1989.\n       Fuel is the second-largest expense after personnel. Each \n     penny increase represents $170 million in annual costs.\n       ``Whenever we have a sharp increase in jet fuel costs, it's \n     almost always resulted in enormous losses in the industry,'' \n     says Air Transport Association economist David Swierenga. \n     Travelers could notice higher fares this year as airlines try \n     to compensate for the rise in fuel costs, Swierenga says.\n       The money has ``to come from someplace,'' says Gus Whitcomb \n     of America West. Its fuel costs rose to 71 cents a gallon \n     from 60 cents in January.\n       ``The traveler will have to pay more,'' agreed Delta Air \n     Lines spokesman Bill Berry.\n       Airline fares already have increased about 8% this year.\n       American Airlines is trying to develop a plan with the \n     Federal Aviation Administration to fly more direct routes \n     that tend to burn less fuel.\n       But Wall Street analysts say airlines are overly concerned: \n     The analysts expect fuel prices to subside later this year.\n       Another plus: the expiration of the 10% ticket tax in \n     January, which could save the industry $5 billion this year.\n       ``There would have to be a lot of negative events for the \n     industry not to have a profit this year,'' says Lehman \n     Brothers airline analyst Brian Harris.\n\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Mr. President, we speak a great deal about families and \npeople who are struggling to make a living. In the Midwest everybody \nwho produces things uses fuel. Our farmers get on a tractor and drive \nit all day using fuel all day. A trucker runs a truck and uses fuel all \nday.\n  A builder uses fuel all day. There are some who believe in taxing the \nmeans of production. I say we should lessen the tax on the means of \nproduction and let us discover, as we know that will stimulate the \neconomy and we will have more revenue in the Federal Treasury, because \nwe will have more economic activity.\n  Now, some have said that we do not want to pass this cut in the gas \ntax, this repeal, because the benefits will go to the companies and not \nthe consumers. That is not true. This will be structured in such a way \nthat the consumers and the users will get this.\n  Others have said the high gas prices are caused in part by a need for \nmore antitrust action. I say fine. I am an advocate of vigorous \nenforcement of the antitrust laws under Scott-Hart-Rodino antitrust or \nunder Clayton or under the Sherman Antitrust Acts. Also, the price-\nfixing aspects of those, if there is evidence thereof.\n  All those steps are necessary and good but as a member of the Senate \nFinance Committee we have a chance to repeal the gas tax. We should do \nso. It will help consumers. It will help families. It will help \nagriculture. It will help tourism. It will help all the aspects of our \neconomy as we enter this summer after this long, difficult winter.\n  Mr. President, in conclusion, let me say that it is time to repeal \nthe gas tax. It is time to give to consumers that break. It is time to \ncreate more economic activity in agriculture and tourism and trucking \nso that our economy can grow instead of being restricted by taxation. \nThis is a rare opportunity at the beginning of this spring and summer \nseason, after this long, hard winter. Our people are bursting forth \nwith energy to do things. To repeal this tax now would be another boost \nto them.\n  I am proud to join in this effort to repeal the gas tax. I yield the \nfloor.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from South Dakota. \nHe represents a rural economy. We all know that the gas tax is uniquely \ndifficult for rural communities. I know the Presiding Officer would \nlike to speak to this issue. I yield up to 10 minutes to the Senator \nfrom Alaska.\n  Mr. STEVENS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Coverdell). The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Georgia, the \ncurrent occupant of the chair for his courtesy. I am very privileged to \njoin\n\n[[Page S4656]]\n\nthis group that is talking today about the economics, and particularly \nabout taxes.\n  Mr. President, yesterday, May 2, was Tax Freedom Day in Alaska. Next \nTuesday will be the National Tax Freedom Day. That is the day we quit \nworking for governments--whether it is Federal, State, or local \ngovernment--and start working for our children, for ourselves, for our \nfamilies.\n  For the period from January 1 to May 2, in Alaska we have to take \nwhat we earn, literally, and pay it to one of those governments. I \nthink it was especially difficult for middle-income Americans to make \ntheir checks out to the Internal Revenue Service this year because the \ntax cut that Congress approved to reduce taxes for families was vetoed \nby President Clinton.\n  The Balanced Budget Act that Congress passed cut taxes for low- and \nmiddle-income taxpayers. It would have reduced the tax burden on \nmarried couples and allowed homemakers to save for their retirement \nwith an individual retirement account. Congress also provided a $500-\nper-child tax credit. If President Clinton had signed our bill into \nlaw, many Americans who had filed their tax returns on April 15 would \nbe getting a tax refund now, instead of having to have made the payment \nthey did make on April 15.\n  Three years ago, President Clinton demanded and obtained approval of \nthe Congress of the largest tax increase in history. That was a bill \nthat I opposed. I want to point out not one Republican voted for it. \nWhat really made Alaskans mad, when that was passed, was that it was a \nretroactive tax.\n  I am pleased to see the Senator from Georgia in the chair at this \nparticular time, when it is announced that the Governmental Affairs \nCommittee, which I chair, will mark up his legislation to ban unfair \nretroactive tax increases the next time we meet in markup.\n  Our Senate Committee on Governmental Affairs has oversight over all \ngovernmental agencies, and I want to share some observations about that \njurisdiction. We have some difficult problems with the IRS. They are \ntaxpayer problems, not our committee's problems, but we have been \nreviewing them.\n  The problems are literally horror stories, situations that terrorize \nAmericans who work hard and try to abide by the laws that we pass. \nAmong the horror stories I have heard recently include the IRS \nrepeatedly levying against the property of a widow in Anchorage, AK. \nThat widow did nothing improper. She filed a joint return for the year \nof her husband's death in 1993 and later applied to use the credit from \ntheir overpayment in 1993 to pay her own tax bill as a widow in 1994. \nThe IRS has stopped processing the 1993 return, so when the 1994 tax \nreturn was reviewed, the credit could not be used. Her first notice of \nthe situation was a notice of the levy on her property, which she \nreceived in the fall of 1995; that notice of levy was for underpayment \nof her 1994 taxes, notwithstanding the fact she had overpaid taxes in \n1993.\n  Now, that is an impossible situation. Why should a taxpayer be called \nto task before the Internal Revenue Service checks its own records as \nto whether or not there is a prior year overpayment? Another case is \nthe levy and sale of State fishing permits by the Internal Revenue \nService. We have in the State of Alaska a number of hard-working \nindividuals who have developed a tax compliance program to try and help \nrural Alaskan Native fishermen who are now starting to earn money \nthrough the management of our fisheries. Many of them do not have \nEnglish as a first language, Mr. President. The Tax Code can be a \ndifficult thing for them.\n  In Alaska, our State will actually loan money to fishermen to pay \ntheir Federal taxes if they get behind because of the economy--the \nfishing prices change, their costs are difficult, and many of them look \nto their current income to pay taxes when they are due. It can be \ndifficult to save in the prior year, and they are not subject to \nwithholding. They are self-employed.\n  The IRS recently went ahead and seized and auctioned permits \nbelonging to Alaskan Native fisherman. That sent a very negative \nmessage to these people who were just coming forward to work with our \nState and the group that joined together to help them understand the \ntax laws. The State had already committed funds to help with regard to \nsuch taxes. If they had had proper notice of IRS intentions with \nrespect to these cases, they would have loaned money to these people.\n  I must say, just parenthetically, that Commissioner Margaret \nRichardson showed genuine concern for the Native people. She went to \nAlaska with me. She visited some of the people involved, and I think \nshe is going to try and help work out some solutions to the problems.\n\n  I am sure that every Member of Congress hears routinely the kind of \ncomplaints and horror stories from constituents as I hear from \nAlaskans. These are stories regarding lost records, missing notices, \ncomputer errors, and just the all-around hardness of some people in the \nIRS, who have the job of collection.\n  In my judgment, there are a great many mistakes in the IRS that cost \ntaxpayers dearly. Each time they get in one of these problems, they \nhave to hire an attorney, take time off from work, or try to get an \naccountant to help them solve their problems. The real difficulty is, \nwhen we think about when I was talking about Tax Freedom Day, Alaskans \nwork all those first 4 months of the year to pay the people who bring \nthese problems to their doors. We have a lack of understanding too many \ntimes by Government employees about who is really paying their \nsalaries.\n  Many of the problems I find in our oversight of the IRS by the \nGovernmental Affairs Committee results from the IRS's 10-year attempt \nto modernize its computers. The IRS goal in this regard to centralize \nthe data base and make taxpayer data immediately accessible when a \ntaxpayer calls to resolve a problem is a good goal. But the IRS \ncomputer system currently cannot interface. These computers do not talk \nto each other, Mr. President. When taxpayers call to resolve a computer \nerror, they can find themselves talking to a computer, not an \nindividual that can analyze their problem.\n  Furthermore, IRS financial management system is in disarray. Millions \nin taxpayers' money has been spent on modernization, with very little \nresults. The General Accounting Office recently reported to our \ncommittee that the IRS cannot account for $10.4 billion in taxes that \nits records show it collected.\n  In addition, taxpayer privacy is now at risk. Federal standards for \ninformation systems are not being followed by the IRS. The National \nResearch Council, which again has helped our committee analyze this \nproblem, stated to us, ``the gap between the current tax system \nmodernization security posture and the minimum security acceptable will \ncontinue to widen, thus, virtually assuring massive security breaches \nin coming years.''\n  That is a warning to our committee that if the IRS continues on the \npath it is on now, the security of taxpayer information is going to \nbecome worse, despite the fact that we are spending millions trying to \nimprove the computer system. Computers cannot replace human beings, Mr. \nPresident. The IRS must administer the tax system with the precision it \ndemands of taxpayers.\n  The Tax Code is too complex. The Internal Revenue Service reported to \nus that it takes, they believe, an average of 12 hours for a taxpayer \nto complete a standard 1040 form. The Schedule C, small business people \nwill need an average of 22 hours, they say, to fill out the 1040. I am \nadvised that Money Magazine ran a little experiment. They hired 50 \nprofessional tax preparers--professionals--each to complete a tax \nreturn for the same hypothetical taxpayer. The result was 50 different \ntax bills.\n  Americans should not have to play Russian roulette with the IRS.\n  Recently, our Senate Governmental Affairs Committee held an oversight \nhearing on the IRS. As I say, these problems are significant. I have \ncome to the floor today to announce to the Senate that we will hold \nfour more hearings on the IRS. The hearings will provide the Senate \nwith information about steps that the Congress and the administration \nmust take to bring the IRS into the 21st century, with fairness and \nprotection for taxpayers.\n  I will close with what I said earlier, Mr. President. Congress must \ndemand\n\n[[Page S4657]]\n\nthat the Internal Revenue Service administer our tax system with the \nsame precision it demands of the taxpayers themselves.\n  Thank you very much.\n  Mr. GREGG addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from New \nHampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. I understand we are in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. We are in morning business with 90 minutes \ndedicated to the Senator from Georgia, or his designee.\n  Mr. GREGG. Pursuant to that, I yield myself 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized for 10 minutes.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, we are here to talk a little bit about \ntaxes and how we got into this mess on gasoline prices. I suspect this \nmess came to my attention about the same way it came to everybody \nelse's attention. I went down to my gas station to fill up my Ford \nTaurus, which usually takes about 11 gallons of gas, unless my \ndaughter, who is 16, has been driving it--then it takes about 12\\1/2\\ \ngallons of gas. But I noticed that when it got to the usual dollar \namount where it is full and I pay the bill, the thing was still taking \ngas and the dollars were still going up. It appeared to me that, by the \ntime it stopped taking its 11 or so gallons of gas, the bill I was \ngetting was about 20, 25 percent more than what I was used to paying. I \nasked myself, ``Why, suddenly, is gas costing so much? Why has it \nbecome so expensive''\n  Well, clearly, one of the elements of this is the tax we have to pay \non the gas. Today in some States the percentage of the actual cost of a \ngallon of gas in taxes is as high as 40 percent.\n  One of the core taxes that we have to pay is the Federal tax. I think \nthat to understand why the Federal tax has gotten so expensive, we have \nto review a little bit of history. It was back in 1993, 3 years ago, \nwhich is a time that I am afraid what happened may have faded from \npeople's attention. But it certainly has not faded from people's \nattention as to how it is affecting their pocketbooks, because when \nthey fill up their car, they are paying the cost for what happened in \nthat period of time. It was at that time that President Clinton came \nforward with his budget bill and proposed the largest tax increase in \nthe history of the United States, which was passed at the time, and in \nwhich there was included the gas tax increase.\n\n  There are three things in particular that I think we should focus on, \nbecause these three issues were the key focus of the debate back then. \nThe first is the size of that tax increase, which was extraordinary. \nThe second was the retroactivity, which was discussed earlier by the \nSenator from Alaska. And the third is the energy tax component and what \nultimately became the gas tax. But it started out as another energy \ntax.\n  Now, that tax that occurred 3 years ago was $275 billion over 5 \nyears. That is, as I mentioned, the largest tax increase in history. I \nopposed it, and I know Senator Coverdell opposed, Senator Stevens \nopposed it, Senator Mack opposed it. All of us presently on the floor \nhere opposed it. It was pushed through the Congress by President \nClinton and his supporters on the liberal side of the aisle. They pooh-\npoohed our resistance to it. They said America can afford to pay more \ntaxes.\n  So let me translate what that tax increase means in terms of today. \nFor the past year or so, we as Republicans have been talking about \ncutting taxes. In fact, we sent a balanced budget down to the \nPresident. As part of that balanced budget, we suggested we cut taxes. \nInitially, we suggested a tax cut of $270 million. That was a 7-year \nfigure. We ended up with a tax cut proposal of $170 billion. Once \nagain, the President said, ``That is outrageous, you cannot cut taxes \nthat much.'' Well, I guess I can understand that, because the tax \nincrease that he hit the American people with back in 1993, over a 5-\nyear period, was scored as a $275 billion increase. But if you look at \nit in the 7-year context of the budget that we proposed, that was a \n$400 billion increase in taxes on the American people.\n  So when you hear the President say that our $170 billion tax cut, \nwhich is aimed at benefiting families with children--a $500 credit for \nfamilies with children--is excessive and too much, you might think, ``I \nguess that is his view of the world,'' because, in his view, he thought \na $400 billion tax increase was just right back in 1993.\n  And then we have this retroactivity content. This massive tax \nincrease that the American people were hit with in 1993 included an \nincredibly insidious event. The tax increase was so aggressive, there \nwas so much frothing at the mouth to hit the American taxpayers with \nnew taxes on the other side of the aisle, and from this new President, \nMr. Clinton, they were not happy with taxing you in the future $400 \nbillion, they decided to tax you even before you arrived there, putting \nin retroactive language that said the tax would actually start before \nPresident Clinton became President. That is pretty outrageous. Luckily \nwe have people like Senator Coverdell in this body who has taken that \nbull by the horns and proposed repealing the concept of retroactivity, \nor not to allow retroactivity again. Senator Stevens, chairman of his \ncommittee, has agreed to take up that matter.\n\n  That is an important point because I think, on the issue of taxes, we \nought to be at least as good as the former Soviet Union, as Russia. In \nthe Russian Constitution you cannot have retroactive taxes. But here \nBill Clinton has come forward and hit us with retroactivity.\n  So thanks to people like Senator Coverdell and Senator Stevens, \nhopefully, we will be able to change that so that will not occur again \non the American people.\n  The third issue, of course, is this question of the specifics of this \ngas tax, because this really is frustrating, because originally what \nthe President suggested was that he wanted, in 1993, something called \nthe Btu tax. They were going to tax every element of \nenergy that people in this country \nused--every element. In New England that would have been a horrendous \nevent because we have to heat our homes. It is cold in New England, and \nwe use oil, and the Btu tax would have been attached to oil.\n  But the claim was that this was not really a tax--that this really \nwas not a tax in the sense that we were taking money from the American \npeople. No. The claim of the administration was that this was an \nattempt to conserve energy, that this was an environmental action. This \nwas sold as an environmental necessity--to hit the American people with \na Btu tax. Well, even this Congress could not swallow that piece of \nmalarkey. Oh, they backed up and they said, ``All right, we cannot get \nthe Btu tax. We will hit the American people with a 4.3-cent increase \nin the gasoline tax instead.'' Again, they claimed it was on the issue \nof the environment that they were going to do that, raise that tax. \nPretty outrageous. Pretty outrageous because at the same time the \nleadership on the other side of the aisle and the President were \nexcoriating Republicans for being the party of the rich, for being the \nparty that was only concerned about the rich, and they were going to \npass a tax on the rich.\n  That is what their tax was going to be--their tax package of $275 \nbillion back in 1993, which is actually $400 billion if you put it on \nthe budget cycle we are on today.\n  Retroactivity. It was not going to affect the average, everyday \nAmericans. It was going to hit rich. That is the way it was sold. It \nwas an energy that would benefit people. It would be a benefit to the \npeople of this country because it was needed for environmental \nprotection; and, two, that this whole tax package was going to just be \nan attack on the rich in this country.\n\n  Let me quote from the present Democratic leader--at that time a \nMember of good standing in the Senate on the Democratic side but not \nthe leader at that time--as to what Senator Daschle said about this tax \nincrease that they put on the American people.\n\n       So let no one be misled when it comes to taxes. The taxes \n     affect mostly those making $180,000. The taxes affect those \n     businesses in only 4 percent of the highest income brackets \n     available today, an average income, by the way, of about \n     $565,000.\n\n  You tell me when you go to fill up your car at the gas pumps. Does \nthe attendant ask you, ``Are you making $180,000 a year?'' I do not \nthink so. When you pull your pickup truck up, if you are a farmer in \nNew Hampshire or a logger in New Hampshire and you are trying to make a \nvery small margin because you are in a tough business, does\n\n[[Page S4658]]\n\nthe gas attendant say, ``Are you a corporation making $560,000 a \nyear?'' I do not think so.\n  The fact is that this is an incredibly regressive tax, and it was not \nput in place for environmental protection. It was put in place because \nthere was an avarice amongst the liberal Members of this Congress and \namongst this administration by demanding that they take more money from \nthe American people so that they could spend it because they do not \nhappen to believe you can spend your own money.\n  There is a basic philosophical difference between our two parties. \nThe party of the other side of the aisle does not believe that you know \nhow to spend your money. They happen to think the Government knows how \nto spend your money. We happen to believe that you know how to spend \nyour money, and you should be allowed to. For that reason, we do not \nhappen to support this type of a tax increase. We did not support it \nthen, and we do not support it now.\n  So our basic view is, let us let the American people keep their own \nhard-earned money. When you go into a gas station, let us not have the \ngas station attendant have to question you as to your income level in \norder to remain consistent with the loftiness of this administration, \nbut rather let us allow you, the American people, to keep your money \nand spend it yourself.\n  That is why we put in place a balanced budget amendment. We put \nforward a balanced budget bill which would reduce spending and allow us \nto also reduce taxes. We did not put forward, as the President did, a \nbill which increased spending and increased your taxes. There is a \nfundamental difference in philosophy.\n\n  So I congratulate the Senator from Georgia on having this special \norder. I also especially congratulate him on his proposal to pass a \nconstitutional amendment to end retroactive taxes so that we can at \nleast do as well as the new democracy of Russia.\n  I congratulate the Presiding Officer, the Senator from Alaska, for \nbeing willing to hold hearings.\n  I yield.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia is recognized.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. I want to commend the Senator from New Hampshire not \nonly for his remarks, but I appreciate the very kind remarks addressed \nto myself and the Chair.\n  At this time, I yield up to 10 minutes to the Senator from Florida.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida is recognized for 10 \nminutes.\n  Mr. MACK. Thank you, Mr. President. I thank the Senator for yielding.\n  Mr. President, I rise today to address the future of the American \ndream. America was built on the spirit of innovation and ingenuity, the \nbelief in responsibility, and in risk taking. We believed that, if we \njust did the right thing and we worked hard at it, opportunity would be \nthere. But for many Americans who struggle to earn a living and raise a \nfamily, the American dream is now out of reach.\n  When I ask my constituents this question, ``How many of you have a \nbetter quality of life than your parents did when they were your age?'' \nmost said yes. But when I asked them, ``How many of you honestly \nbelieve your children will have a better quality of life when they \nreach your age?'' most said no.\n  Today, Americans are anxious. They are anxious about job security \nwith an economy which is not growing as fast as it should. They are \nanxious about the future of our Nation when every child born in America \ntoday will receive a tax bill of $187,000 just to pay the interest on \nthe Federal debt. They are anxious about paying for a welfare system \nthat discourages work as opposed to encouraging work. They are anxious \nabout the quality of their children's education. They are anxious about \nthe safety of their neighborhoods. They are anxious about a Washington \nthat spends too much, dictates too much, and takes too much of their \nmoney to pay for programs that we all now know have failed. We can and \nmust do better.\n\n  The Clinton administration will brag that economic growth is strong. \nHowever, under Clintonomics, the economy is moving at a slower pace \nthan it has historically. We should not allow this administration to \nhide behind statistics and lower expectations for the greatest economy \nin the world.\n  America was made great because we have strived, sacrificed, and \nworked together to be the best. We must not settle for economic \nmediocrity. The Clinton administration will brag that it has created \nmore than 8 million new jobs. So where is the problem? They will not \ntell you that, if this recovery were similar to previous recoveries, \nthere should have been over 11 million new jobs created. That is 3 \nmillion jobs that should have been created for American families and \nwere not because of excessive Washington interference.\n  The Clinton administration will tell the American worker, ``Do not \nworry. Everything is fine.'' But the American worker knows better. They \nfeel the anxiety of Clintonomics every time they pick up their pay \nchecks or read a story about loss of jobs and layoffs. We can and must \ndo better. Like every other issue, this administration wants to blame \nAmericans' anxieties on everyone else. Bill Clinton cannot impose the \nlargest tax hike in American history and spend more on Washington \nprograms and work to control more of our lives from Washington without \nfacing the consequences of lost jobs, low wages, and limited \nopportunities.\n  A small businessman in Florida told me that he is often forced to \ntell his employees that the pay raise they were hoping to receive was \njust sent to Washington, DC.\n  We can and must do better. We can begin to restore the American dream \nby cutting Bill Clinton's tax increases.\n  Next Tuesday marks Tax Freedom Day, the day your entire tax bill \nwould be paid off if 100 percent of your salary were devoted to taxes \nsince January 1.\n  Let me say that in a different way.\n  What that means is that between January 1 of this year until May 2, \nit will take everything you earn to pay your tax bill for the State, \nlocal, and Federal governments. This year tax freedom day is the latest \nit has ever been. For every dollar that is earned, the American people \npay 38 cents for taxes at all levels. That is 38 percent of everything \nwe earn. The more you pay in taxes, the less you have to feed your \nfamily, educate your children, and put gas in the car. It is no wonder \nthat of all the new jobs in America, more than one-third have gone to \npeople taking an extra job just to make ends meet. Those jobs are not \ngoing to young Americans entering the work force for the first time or \nto those who should be off welfare. They are second jobs that families \nmust have just to get by. It strains the economy, and it hurts our \nfamilies.\n  We must free the economy from the burdens of more taxes and more \ngovernment so resources can be invested in new technologies for \ntomorrow's jobs. We must cut the capital gains tax rate to allow for \nmore savings and more investment, for more innovation and more \nopportunity for future generations. Americans are having to work harder \nand harder just to pay for larger and larger bureaucracies in \nWashington that include 160 job training programs, 240 education \nprograms, 300 economic development programs, and 500 urban aid \nprograms. American taxpayers feel they are not getting their money's \nworth and they are not. We must end Washington's appetite for more \nspending because higher deficits mean higher interest rates for homes, \ncars and student loans.\n  President Clinton was wrong to veto the only balanced budget to reach \nthe White House in a generation. We must recover the American dream by \ncontrolling America's spending habits. I proposed a way to guarantee \nspending cuts. It is called the Spending Reductions Commitment Act. An \noutside group would cut wasteful spending if Washington does not. In \nother words, it is patterned after the Base Closure Commission. We \nrestore the American dream when we have reduced the cost, size, and \nscope of government. Most of us believe that Washington is too big, \nspends too much, and has too many failed programs. We can and must do \nbetter to restore the American dream, to free up the American spirit, \nto restore the promise of hope and opportunity for all Americans. If we \nget Washington off our backs, away from our schools and out of our \npocketbooks, we can return this country to the road of greatness where \nit has been in the past and where it is destined to be in the future.\n\n[[Page S4659]]\n\n  I thank the Senator for yielding.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I really appreciate the remarks and \ncomments about hopes and dreams of Americans as represented by the \nSenator from Florida. It reminded me of a snapshot that we recently \ntook, a financial snapshot as it were, of an average family in Georgia. \nMy guess is there is not a lot of difference between the average family \nin Georgia and the average working family in Florida. The American \npeople have really been asking us in Washington to change the way we do \nbusiness.\n  It is very understandable when you look at this picture. This family \nof four estimated median income is $45,093. The total Federal taxes on \nthat income are $9,511. That is just over 20--it is approaching 25 \npercent. The total State and local taxes are $5,234. That is about 12 \npercent. So the total family tax burden now--they may have had $45,000, \nbut $14,700, or $15,000 has left the family, gone somewhere else for a \npolicy wonk up here in Washington or the State capital to decide how \nthe earnings of that family ought to be spent. They have been removed \nfrom the family.\n  Then there is the estimated cost of Federal regulation. We have \ngotten into the business, as every American knows, of managing every \naspect of our lives and our communities. Well, that cost a whopping \n$6,615. My goodness, that is more than State and local taxes that that \nfamily is now having to pay out in order to regulate. I think if the \nAmerican family knew that it was paying over $500 a month--more than \ntheir car payment, more than their student loan--to fund this \nregulatory apparatus, they would be astounded.\n  Then they have to pay the excess family interest payments which are \ncaused by Federal borrowing--$2,011 in higher interest payments because \nof Federal borrowing.\n  So the estimated total Government cost to this Georgia family that \nmade $45,093 is $23,371, or 52 percent, Mr. President, of every dollar \nthe family earned.\n  Thomas Jefferson has got to be rolling in his grave. Not any of our \nFounders could ever have conceived of a government that would remove \nover 50 percent of the wages of a wage earner and take it away. And we \nwonder why there has been a breakdown in the American family. There is \nno institution that has had a more profound effect on this family than \nthe Government itself. We talk about Hollywood from time to time, we \ntalk about pop culture and everything else, and I think they have had \nan effect, but nothing compares to this, Mr. President. I mean nothing. \nTo take 52 percent of the working wages out of an American family has a \nprofound effect on the activities of the family.\n  Mr. President, I see that I have just been joined by the \ndistinguished Senator from Alaska. I know he is eager to speak on the \nsubject of taxation, and I will yield up to 10 minutes to the Senator \nfrom Alaska.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Stevens). The Senator from Alaska is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I thank my friend from Georgia and wish him a good day \nas well as the Presiding Officer, my good friend and colleague, Senator \nStevens. Good morning.\n  Mr. President, I just came from a Finance Committee hearing where our \nmajority leader, Senator Dole, spoke very eloquently about the issue of \nthe removal of the 4.3-cent-per-gallon gasoline tax. I commend the \nmajority leader as well as our colleague, Senator Gramm, for proposing \nthe repeal of this unwise and unjust tax.\n  As everyone knows in this body, the pressure to repeal the 1993 gas \ntax is, to a large degree, related to the recent spike in gasoline \nprices that has occurred in every State, with California being \nespecially hard hit. In my State of Alaska where, by necessity, a large \nnumber of vehicles must be four-wheel drive, we are currently paying \n$1.33 for unleaded regular. The irony of that, as you know, Mr. \nPresident, is we are providing about 22, 23 percent of all the crude \noil that is produced domestically in this country.\n  Next week, as chairman of the Energy and Natural Resources Committee, \nI will be holding hearings in that committee to examine the underlying \nreasons for these price hikes. We are going to have representatives \nfrom the major oil companies that produce domestically as well as \nproducers and distributors that depend heavily on imports. We are going \nto have refiners that depend on domestic supply and those that depend \non imports. We are going to have testimony from retailers, and we are \nalso going to examine an element that is often overlooked, and that is \nthe gas tax aspect that is added on by both the State and Federal \ngovernments.\n  The preliminary information I have suggests there are several reasons \nfor these price increases. One is, we have had a very cold, and very \nextended winter that has forced refiners to continue processing heating \noil longer than usual. We have just-in-time inventory methods adopted \nby many oil companies that have left smaller than normal gasoline \nreserves on hand.\n  We have had an increase--and this is interesting--in worldwide demand \nas a consequence of the fast growing economy in Asia, putting pressure \non oil stocks around the world. And America's demand for gasoline has \nbeen increasing as more than 40 percent of the new vehicles sold are \nlight trucks or sport utility vehicles that are so popular. And these \nvehicles only get 15 miles or so to the gallon. And, of course, we have \nraised the speed limit in many areas.\n  But, realistically, the discussion of eliminating the 4.3-cent-a-\ngallon tax, while it is interesting, misses the underlying issue, which \nis the issue of supply and exploration for new sources of domestic oil. \nI certainly support repealing the gas tax because it should not have \nbeen adopted in the first place. The gas tax hike, along with $240 \nbillion in other new taxes was put through by a Democratic-controlled \nSenate in 1993 without a single Republican Senator supporting it. It \nwas adopted at that time at the insistence of President Clinton.\n  But the point I want to make is, we are talking about taking off the \ngas tax and we are not talking to any degree about the basic problem, \nand that is the problem of supply. Furthermore, the potential revenue \nloss associated with this is about $30 billion, if it is extended out \nand removed for the entire period that is anticipated in the budget.\n  Let us look at some energy facts. U.S. oil consumption today is 18 \nmillion barrels each day. We are importing 9 million barrels each day. \nIn 1973, the year of the Arab oil embargo, U.S. import dependence was \n36 percent. It was 36 percent in 1973. Today, it is 51 percent. The \nDepartment of Energy predicts that by the year 2000--that is only 4 \nyears from now--the United States will be importing two-thirds of its \noil consumption. Since 1973, domestic oil production has fallen by 30 \npercent. We are producing 30 percent less.\n  Let me reflect on an action recently taken by the President \nconcerning pulling down the strategic petroleum reserve. As chairman of \nthe Energy and Natural Resources Committee, we authorized, because one \nof the storage areas in the salt caverns was leaking, the removal of \nthat oil. We anticipated revenue being generated from that sale. It was \nnecessary to get that oil out; otherwise it would have leached into the \nwater table. It was better to get it out and sell it than try to move \nit to another place.\n  The President jumped on this as an answer, or a potential relief to \nthe crisis associated with increased gasoline taxes. That is absolutely \nabsurd. Let us look at the strategic petroleum reserve. It contains 580 \nmillion barrels, valued at about $16 billion. For the President, in his \nannouncement about releasing 12 million barrels, to suggest that his \naction is going to drive down prices, it is a drop in the bucket. It is \nless than a day's U.S. consumption. It is a spit in the ocean compared \nto world oil production of 60 million barrels a day.\n  The President also has a proposal to sell an additional 75 million \nbarrels in the year 2002. But that proposal is to use the $1.5 billion \nproceeds not for energy security, but to pay for social programs. He is \nusing the SPR for the purpose of financing social spending and using it \nfor the purpose of regulating the market price of oil.\n  The letter ``s'' in SPR stands for strategic--strategic petroleum \nreserve is what it means. The purpose of SPR was\n\n[[Page S4660]]\n\nto preserve the Nation's security in the event of a supply interruption \nsuch as we saw in 1973 and 1979, and not for the purpose of financing \nsocial spending or, as I indicated, regulating the market price of oil. \nThe President has taken upon himself to turn the SPR into almost a \ngiant piggy bank and a back-door price regulator, without the consent \nof the Congress.\n\n  So we have a rather curious set of circumstances here. Among the \nPresident's other anticipated relief is the assumption, coming from the \nUnited Nations, that crude oil prices would drop if Iraqi oil came back \non the market. How quickly we forget. It is interesting to look at this \nproposal. The United Nations suggests that if it is satisfied that Iraq \nhas allowed full and complete inspections of its nuclear weapon \ncapability, that for humanitarian purposes Iraq would be allowed to \nsell roughly $1 billion worth of oil. That amount of oil equates to \nabout 50 million barrels every 4 months, or 150 million barrels per \nyear.\n  Not so long ago we had a half million American troops, some of whom \nlost their lives in that Persian Gulf conflict. That conflict was all \nabout Saddam Hussein controlling the world supply of oil and, as a \nconsequence, the stranglehold that he imposed on the Kuwaitis--and he \nwas looking at the Saudis.\n  Mr. President, I wonder if I can ask my colleague for 3 more minutes \nso I can finish my statement?\n  Mr. COVERDELL. I yield 3 minutes to the Senator.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. So, is it not rather ironic that suddenly we are \nlooking for relief from Saddam Hussein who just a few years ago we \ntried to put in a cage because he was a threat? He was a threat to the \nworld supply of oil. He must be laughing, saying, ``Ain't America \ngreat? Here they are, needing the contribution of Iraqi oil on the \nmarket.'' What a curious set of events.\n  I can recall in 1971, Senator Dole, Senator McClure, Senator Simpson, \nSenator Metzenbaum and myself met with Saddam Hussein. It was clear at \nthat time when we were over in Baghdad that he intended to try to \ncontrol the supply of oil. The problem is, nobody believed it at that \ntime. But here we are today, looking to Iraq to come back on line so we \nmight relieve our dependence on imported oil.\n  Mr. President, in the Washington Post today, Charles Krauthammer has \na very interesting article. It is entitled, ``A Nation of Crybabies.'' \nIn answer to the question of why the price is increasing, he responds \nby saying: ``How about--a wild guess--because supply is down and the \ndemand is up?''\n  Why is the supply down? He says the country raised the speed limit. \nHe says the sport utility roadsters are using more and more gas. He \nalso says that crude oil production has dropped 32 percent in the last \n25 years, and we will not allow drilling in the Arctic National \nWildlife Refuge for fear of disturbing the mating habits of the \ncaribou.\n  He goes on to say more about supply:\n\n       U.S. crude oil production is in serious decline.\n\n  We know that. Alaska has been producing about 23 percent of the total \ncrude oil.\n  He says:\n\n       The North Slope of Alaska holds potentially the largest oil \n     field in North America, bigger even than Prudhoe Bay next \n     door, which produces 600,000 barrels a day. Unshakable \n     opposition from Democrats has for 15 years prevented even \n     test drilling there. Don't want to disturb a pristine \n     environment, even in a place not one in a million Americans \n     will ever see? Fine.\n\n  But you better be prepared for the cost.\n  Finally, Mr. President, it is fair to say that we are at a crisis. We \nare going to be facing increased gasoline prices. The Fourth of July we \ncould be seeing gas prices substantially higher. I suggest they will be \nover $2 and in some parts of the country, they could approach $3.\n  Finally, we have no extraordinary political development in the \nMideast that can be blamed for the current price rise, but the problem \nrelates to supply and demand. And I suggest that this body, the Senate \nas well as the House of Representatives, has passed an answer. They \npassed ANWR. ANWR passed the House and passed the Senate. There is just \none person standing in the way of opening up this huge reserve that \nwould give us energy independence, and that is President Clinton. He \nhas to bear the responsibility associated with it.\n  So repealing the 4.3-cent gas tax is a modest step, it is a necessary \nstep, but the ultimate issue is developing our own resources.\n  I thank the Chair, I thank my good friend from Georgia, and I wish my \ncolleagues a good day.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I yield up to 10 minutes to the \ndistinguished Senator from Iowa.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa is recognized for up to \n10 minutes.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, you can still hear these words echoing \nfrom 4 years ago: ``I oppose Federal excise gas tax increases. It \nsticks it to the lower income and middle-income retired people in the \ncountry, and it's wrong.''\n  Four years ago those words were stated.\n  These are not my words, Mr. President, these are the words of Bill \nClinton who was running for President in 1992 and who was elected.\n  Just 1 year later after that campaign, President Clinton proposed and \nwon passage of Federal excise gas tax increases. In the process, he \nreally stuck it to the lower income and middle-income retired people in \nthe country and it is wrong, contrary to those very words he used in \n1992.\n  You might say, Mr. President, that he really stuck it to a lot of \npeople more than just the folks who are retired. He stuck it to the \nentire population across the board--farmers, truck drivers, commuters, \nbus drivers, vacationers, boaters--you name it, Mr. President, \nPresident Clinton really stuck it to them.\n  In fact, it was done along party-line votes. It was part of the \nlargest tax increase in the history of our country. Not a single \nRepublican voted for it. Democrats controlled the White House and both \nHouses of the Congress. Their fingerprints alone are all over the scene \nof this crime, the raising of the biggest tax increase in the history \nof the country.\n\n  This President has a real problem with his record of saying one thing \nand doing another. We who are elected should perform in office \ncommensurate with the rhetoric of our campaign. We should also expect \nthe President of the United States to do that. And, of course, the \nexamples I am using today are just one of many cases. All of them \ncombine to leave people cynical about their leaders in Government.\n  Last year, the President was in Houston addressing a group of high-\ndollar contributors at a Democratic fundraiser. Here is what he told \nthem about his record tax hike of 1993. This is what he said about the \nbiggest tax increase in the history of the country. He said this to his \nrich friends at that fundraiser: ``Probably there are people in this \nroom still mad at me, at that budget, because you think I raised your \ntaxes too much. It might surprise you that I think I raised them too \nmuch, too.''\n  What is interesting is that this seeming apology was to well-off \nAmericans in Houston from whom he was raising money. But you have not \nheard the President apologizing to those lower income and middle-income \nAmericans who he really stuck it to and he was speaking to in the 1992 \ncampaign.\n  In America, I thought that we defined fairness as treating everyone \nthe same. That means rich and poor, black or white. We are all equal. \nSo he apologized to higher income folks in Houston for raising their \ntaxes. Can lower and middle-income Americans and workers in this \ncountry also expect an apology from the President? Why is it fair to \ntax lower and middle-income workers who are trying to save for their \nfuture? These are the citizens who need tax relief the most. They have \na harder time paying the bills and paying their taxes, whether it is \nincome tax or the gas tax at the pump.\n  The President's response to our call to eliminate the gas tax was \npure political panic earlier this week. Somehow, like selling off a few \nmillion barrels would accomplish this problem, but instead it had the \neffect of a gnat taking a nibble out of an elephant.\n  I will tell you what would have a bigger impact than selling off the \nstrategic petroleum reserve. The President\n\n[[Page S4661]]\n\nshould get some of his Cabinet Secretaries to stop their frequent flier \ntrips they have going around the world. That would save much more.\n  The basic problem with this administration and the other side of the \naisle that supports this administration is that their idea of running \nGovernment is the old established principle of their party taxing and \nspending. Translated, that means that the Government's budget goes up \nwhile family budgets go down. It is a zero sum gain.\n\n  If the Government's budget grows, the family's budget automatically \nshrinks. This is upside-down economics, and we have seen it before from \nthe other side. So it is not voodoo economics, it is deja voodoo \neconomics. It is called tax-and-spend.\n  President Clinton and our friends, the Democrats, have it all upside \ndown. Their way has created falling income for workers while increasing \nthe taxes on working Americans. It is a double whammy. It is a one-two \npunch on the workers of America. It really sticks it to them, something \nthe President said he was going to avoid in that 1992 campaign.\n  The President should show moral leadership. The President should do \nthe right thing. He should begin by apologizing to lower- and middle-\nincome workers for raising their taxes, like he apologized to those \nrich Americans at the Houston Democratic fundraiser.\n  We in this body may not be able to force the President to apologize, \nbut we can do something even better for these people. We must restore \ntheir faith in their elected leaders here in Washington. That must have \na high priority. We can do that right away by helping the President \nkeep his promise to the people that he made in 1992 not to raise the \ngas tax because it was going to hurt the retirees and the lower and \nmiddle-income working Americans. We can help restore the faith of these \npeople in Washington by repealing the gas tax.\n  Mr. COVERDELL addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I want to thank the Senator from Iowa. \nHe has pointed to something that I think baffles many Americans. I \nthink they expect that there should be some relevance between what \npeople say when they seek public office and what they do if they get \nit. There should be a connection.\n  As the Senator from Iowa noted earlier, when a person travels the \ncountry and says, as President Clinton did, ``Raising gas taxes sticks \nit to lower income and middle-income retired people in the country, and \nit is wrong,'' an intelligent American citizen would expect that that \nperson, if in office, would not raise gas taxes because he said he \nwould not raise gas taxes.\n  Then you barely get the bags unpacked at the White House, and you are \nup here with a proposal to raise gas taxes. The actual proposal was \neven higher than what happened--double. This has had a profound effect, \nin particular, on low-income people.\n  President Clinton's gas tax increase especially hurts lower income \nfamilies. According to the Joint Economic Committee, the lowest 20 \npercent of taxpayers pay 7.1 percent of their income on gasoline. The \ntop 20 percent of taxpayers pay only 1.6 percent. In other words, the \nlowest income families in America, the lowest income--we remember all \nthe rhetoric that this tax increase only affects the rich--but the \nlowest income families in America pay four times as much of their \ndisposable income on gasoline than the highest 20 percent.\n  Mr. President, I was talking a moment ago about this average family \nin Georgia which is very similar to data in every State. There are \ndifferences, but it is very close. This family, I said, made $45,093. I \nwent through a litany of the State tax, the Federal tax, the FICA tax, \nregulatory costs, higher interest payments. At the end of the day, of \nthe $45,093, this family of four got to keep $21,722. That is all they \nhad left to do everything we asked of a family, which is to raise \nAmerica, house America, clothe America, transport America, provide for \nthe health of America. That is what we are asking of this family. But \nwe only leave them a little less than half of their total wages to do \nit.\n  Here is the point I want to make, Mr. President. This gets back to \nthe promise to the American people the President made. He said, ``I am \ngoing to lower your taxes,'' which meant that this amount of money that \nthey had left would be larger. They responded to that.\n  But in fact, Mr. President, what has happened? In fact, they have \n$2,600 less in their checking account because President Clinton came to \nWashington as their new President. They thought they were going to get \nmore in the checking account, but they got $2,600 a year less. And the \nmeter keeps running with this Presidency. The gas tax, which every time \nthat mother takes the child to the doctor or the car pool to the school \nor goes to the grocery store, that tax meter is running on the gas tax. \nIt just runs and runs and runs.\n  We are suggesting, Mr. President, that President Clinton's gas tax, \n4.3 cents per gallon, be ended, that we stop doing that and we leave \nthat amount of money in the checking account of this family.\n  That will not correct, by any means, the effect of the President's \nhigher taxes on the family. But it starts in the right direction. It \nwill leave about another $100 to $200 in the checking account of this \nfamily that I have been talking about, and that is where it ought to \nbe. We ask so much of this family, our families across the country, and \nwe have taken so much of their resources away. This is a good \nbeginning. End this gas tax, leave that money in these checking \naccounts, and then get on to the business of lowering taxes even more. \nIt is just inexcusable that American families forfeit half their income \nto Government, to policymakers in Washington.\n  Mr. President, this gas tax is pervasive because it hits in many \ndifferent ways. The total cost of the gas tax increase--take, for \nexample, the State of California. California is forfeiting $550 \nmillion. That is half a billion dollars a year coming right out of the \nCalifornia economy. They have had some rough times in California. They \nhave had disaster after disaster. But they are losing $550 million per \nyear because of this gas tax.\n  Take the State of Texas, $368 million a year. Florida, $263 million a \nyear. My own State has lost $60 million a year because of this gas tax. \nWhat do State governments do when they lose revenue? They raise taxes. \nSixteen States in our Union have raised gas taxes to make up for the \nreduced consumption that came when the President raised his taxes.\n  Mr. President, the majority leader, Bob Dole, said in an article in \nUSA Today--he was quoting the comment made by the Senator from Iowa--\n``Probably there are people in this room still mad at me-- '' this is \nPresident Clinton talking to a group in Houston. ``Probably there are \npeople in this room still mad at me over the budget because you think I \nraised your taxes too much. It might surprise you to know, I think I \nraised them too much, too.''\n  Mr. President, for the President to admit he raised taxes too much, \nand then to call on his colleagues here time and time again to block \nevery attempt to reduce taxes on the American people, no wonder the \nAmerican people become cynical about our Government when we have \npolicymakers who go to them and make promises and come here and do \nexactly the opposite. The empirical evidence always shows that when \nthey do the opposite, the person that gets the brunt of the deal is the \naverage American family.\n  Mr. President, I believe my 90 minutes has expired. I suggest the \nabsence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Craig). Without objection, it is ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/05/03/senate-section/article/S4653-8", "month": "05", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "03", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4661-S4663]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     REPUBLICANS' SELECTIVE MEMORY\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I had the opportunity to listen to the \ncolloquy by our colleagues on the other side of the aisle. I wanted to \ncome to the floor for a couple of minutes to respond and I know that a \nnumber of our colleagues will also be doing so a little bit later on \nthis morning.\n\n[[Page S4662]]\n\n  I find the selective memory very intriguing, and I certainly \nappreciate the good words by so many of our colleagues about the impact \nthat the 4-cent gasoline tax has had. What I am surprised at is that \nthey have chosen not to also direct some of their concern and attention \nto the dime's worth of increases in gas taxes in the 1980's and early \n1990's--increases that most of them supported.\n  We raised the tax in 1982 by 5 cents and again in 1991 by an \nadditional 5 cents. As I understand it, almost every single Republican \nsupported those two increases--a dime. In fact, our distinguished \nmajority leader was one of those who supported the increase in gasoline \ntaxes of 10 cents. We like to refer to that 10-cent increase as the \n``Dole dime'' because, in effect, that is what has been the result of \nthe gasoline tax policy over the last 15 years. Mr. President, a 10-\ncent increase was supported by virtually every single Republican in \n1982 and again in 1991.\n  In order to cure this selective memory about gasoline taxes, I would \nremind my colleagues that the 4.3-cent increase that we passed in 1993 \nwas part of an overall budget package that has led to the single most \nconsequential deficit reduction program in the history of this country. \nWe have not seen 4 consecutive years of deficit reduction since the \nCivil War, but we did it in 1993, we did it in 1994, we did it in 1995 \nand now for the 4th year in a row we have done it in 1996. What a \nremarkable achievement. We have brought the deficit down to about half \nof what it was when the Republican Presidents left office after 12 \nyears of dramatic increases in the size of the deficit.\n  The deficit in 1980, as everyone recognized when President Reagan \ntook office, was about $800 billion. After 12 years of Republican White \nHouse domination, that deficit had ballooned from $800 billion to $4.5 \ntrillion. This, despite all the rhetoric about deficit reduction, \ndespite all the promises we were given about how we would bring down \nthe size of the debt--it increased to $4.5 trillion.\n  It took a Democratic White House, with leadership from this \nPresident, beginning the first year he was in office, to force this \ndeficit to come down now for 4 years in a row. We want to continue to \ndo that. The President has made every overture I would expect him to \nmake, urging the majority leader, the Speaker, and others to continue \nnegotiations, trying to find a way, in a bipartisan effort, to maintain \nthis downward trend in the deficit.\n  We can achieve a meaningful deficit reduction package for the next 7 \nyears, bringing deficits to absolute zero if we have the courage and \nthe wherewithal and the determination to do what this President did in \n1993. The opportunity is there. The door is open. We do not have to use \nnew gas taxes. We do not have to find new sources of revenue. We can do \nit with the cuts proposed in this President's budget.\n  As everyone understands, it is a budget that has been scored by the \nCongressional Budget Office, something that the Republican leadership \nhas said again and again is one of the key ingredients to coming to \nsome resolution. The President's CBO-scored budget is, in large \nmeasure, the effect of many months of negotiations with the Republican \nleadership in an effort to continue the progress that this President \nhas made now for the last 4 years.\n  I must say, this selective memory amazes me--I did not hear a word \ntoday about the dime increase, the 10-cent increase supported by \nvirtually every Republican Senator in the past decade. If they are so \nconcerned about the 4.3 cents, why is it we have not heard anything \nabout the 10-cent increase proposed by our colleagues and supported \nalmost unanimously on the other side? If we are going to give tax \nrelief, maybe we ought to go to the Dole dime as well as to the 4.3-\ncent increase that has been discussed this morning.\n\n  I think the real issue here is obfuscation with regard to meaningful \nways of which to help working families. If they really wanted to help \nworking families who are struggling to make ends meet--in many cases, \nwith reductions in purchasing power year after year after year--the \nbest thing they could do would be to pass the minimum wage increase. We \nare talking about a 4.3-cent reduction in taxes, when if we wanted to, \nthis very day we could pass a 45-cent increase in the minimum wage. \nThis afternoon we could pass a 45-cent increase, 41 cents more than the \nrelief we get out of a gallon of gasoline, providing purchasing power \nto millions of struggling American families.\n  This week marks the 35th anniversary of the signing of President \nKennedy's increase in the minimum wage back in 1961. As a result of \nraising the minimum wage in 1961, purchasing power for a working family \nincreased, in 1996 dollars, to $6.61 an hour. You heard it right: $6.61 \nan hour in 1963. That is what working families had at the lowest rung \nof the economic scale 35 years ago--$6.61. Today, they are relegated to \n$4.25. Their purchasing power goes down year after year after year \nafter year.\n  We are now at a 40-year low in terms of purchasing power. While CEO's \nacross this country saw a 28-percent increase in their purchasing power \njust last year to an average of $950,000 per year in salary, the \npurchasing power of working people at the lowest rung of the economic \nscale has gone down to a point where it is almost more beneficial for \nthem to stay on welfare than to go out and work. How wrong is that, Mr. \nPresident?\n  I do not deny any one of those CEO's a good income. In many cases, \nthey deserve it. But if we can find ways in which to advance the \neconomy and build the growth within the economy that we have seen in \nthe last several years--8.5 million jobs, an economy that is booming, \nthe stock market has reached unprecedented levels--why is it we cannot \ncome up with the wherewithal in this country to provide some purchasing \npower for people at the lowest end?\n  We have produced an action agenda that we want to pass sooner rather \nthan later. That action agenda has everything to do with the paycheck--\nfirst, passing a minimum wage that every single American could \nultimately benefit from; secondly, passing retirement security that \nallows people to take their health insurance with them; and finally, \npassing pension and retirement security, making sure that every time a \nworker changes jobs--and the average worker changes jobs now seven \ntimes in his or her lifetime--they can take that pension with them. \nThey can go from one job to the next with the assurance they will have \na pension when they ultimately retire. Pension security, especially for \nwomen, is something we ought to talk a lot more about in the Senate. We \nwill do that in the coming weeks.\n  Mr. President, we can talk about gasoline taxes, this 4.3 cents. I \nsuppose that is something that has relevance to the increase in gas \nprices. We ought to figure out a way to ensure that taxpayers have \nrelief. I think we better make absolutely certain that if we provide \nrelief, it goes in the pockets of the consumers and not the oil \ncompanies. For every 1-cent decrease in tax, we could see $1 billion in \nadditional profit for the oil companies, unless we ensure that the \nbenefits actually get back to the people who need it. We must make \nabsolutely certain our tax relief is for consumers and not some bailout \nfor the big oil companies.\n  If we are really serious about economic security, if we are really \nserious about helping working families, then the best way to help \nworking families, Mr. President, has a lot more to do with minimum \nwage, it has a lot more to do with health security through passing the \nKennedy-Kassebaum bill, it has a lot more to do with pension security \nand making sure retirements are secure when people retire, than it has \nto do with 4 cents on a gasoline tax.\n  So we hope to work with our Republican colleagues and do a number of \nthings this year that can provide real relief. No. 1, let us pass \nminimum wage. No. 2, let us pass Kennedy-Kassebaum. No. 3, let us \nensure that we have pension security. No. 4, let us continue this \ndeficit reduction effort that the President has laid out for us in such \nan able way now for the last 4 years. No. 5, let us pass a balanced \nbudget resolution that allows us deficit reduction, and reduced \ninterest rates, and a healthy economy which can be brought about by a \nbalanced budget. All of this is within our grasp. It is going to take a \nbipartisan effort to do it, but we ought to do it. We can do it now. \nLet us do it, commit to it, and send a clear\n\n[[Page S4663]]\n\nmessage to the American working family that we are on their side.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, for all the right reasons our Nation has \nbeen a generator of radioactive material for nearly five decades. Most \nof this material is a byproduct of two principal activities: national \ndefense activities and commercial nuclear powerplants, which generate \nmore than 20 percent of America's electricity.\n  These two major activities have worked to benefit all Americans. \nTherefore, I believe managing these radioactive wastes is a national \nconcern and responsibility. We cannot and must not walk away from this \nresponsibility. To not address this responsibility would be unwise, \nirresponsible, and unsafe.\n  With specific regard to electrical generation, every American \nbenefits from the richness and diversity of our country's natural \nresources and their use. Through interconnecting transmission lines \nthat traverse the land, we have one of the world's most reliable and \npowerful electricity supplies that drives our economy.\n  Nuclear powerplants are at work in more than 30 States in every \nregion of the country. Supplying more than 20 percent of the Nation's \nelectricity, nuclear energy is part of the foundation for our Nation's \nhigh standard of living and economic growth.\n  For this reason, there is broad consensus and support for ensuring \nthat the Federal Government meet its responsibility to provide a \ncentral storage facility for used nuclear fuel and high-level \nradioactive material from the defense program. Senate bill 1271 allows \nand directs our Federal Government to meet that responsibility.\n  As I know many of my colleagues have discovered in meetings, phone \ncalls, and in their mailrooms, support for S. 1271 is coming from all \nquarters, including State and local government officials, public \nutility commissioners, newspaper editorial boards, labor unions, \nchambers of commerce, national trade associations, and electric \nutilities, just to name a few groups. I am very pleased to have the \nbipartisan support of 28 cosponsors for my legislation.\n  Lawsuits have been filed by 18 States against the Federal Government \nover inaction of the Government to follow their statutory direction to \nmanage radioactive material. This clearly demonstrates the importance \nand urgency of fulfilling the Federal Government's obligation to accept \nspent fuel. That obligation has been directed in law since the 1982 \nNuclear Waste Act, and it is reaffirmed by my legislation.\n  Since the late 1950's, scientists have been studying, testing, and \nsuccessfully employing storage technologies. And since the early \n1970's, the Nevada test site was singled out as one of the nine leading \nsites to consider for a radioactive waste repository. Hasty decisions \nare not being made here. S. 1271 is directing action be taken as a \nresult of the science and technology and testing.\n  Electric customers have committed nearly $12 billion solely to study, \ntest, and build a radioactive waste management system. Already more \nthan $4.6 billion has been spent, much of it to assure public safety. \nNow is the time to act on the Nevada site.\n  Broad-based national support for the nuclear material waste \nmanagement program and S. 1271 is based on the fact that this issue is \nclearly a national concern requiring a national solution. Furthermore, \nsupport is buttressed by the positive work that is ongoing at the \nNevada test site, which is an isolated, unpopulated, dry desert \nlocation that has a long history of uses for some of the most extreme \nresearch known to man.\n\n  For these reasons, I urge my colleagues to join with the many State \nand local officials, labor leaders, business leaders, and scientists \nthroughout the country in support of S. 1271. Allow our citizens the \ncomfort of knowing our Government has acted responsible to assure safe, \nenvironmentally sound long-term storage and disposal of spent nuclear \nfuel and radioactive material.\n  Mr. President, with that, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I am somewhat at a loss because I have been \nin the Finance Committee this morning and also have been serving in \nanother capacity for the last few minutes, so I have not heard any of \nthe actual statements on the floor of the U.S. Senate that have been \nmade this morning. However, it has been brought to my attention that \nseveral statements have been made relative to the gasoline tax and the \nproposal to repeal 4.3-cent-per-gallon of the gasoline tax.\n  Considering that those statements have been made this morning and \nhaving a general idea of probably what those statements were, I would \nlike to not only stand for a moment to respond but also to place in the \nRecord some pertinent facts that I think need to be made very clear.\n  First, in the Finance Committee meeting this morning, which I must \nsay was very spirited, very lively, we had a lot of discussion about \nwhether or not we should repeal the 4.3-cent-per-gallon gas tax enacted \nin 1993 toward deficit reduction. We had a distinguished panel that \nrepresented the truckers, that represented the bus industry, that \nrepresented the airline industry. They had a wonderful man there who \noperates, in Prince Georges County, two service stations. The basic \ntheory was, if we could get the Congress to repeal the 4.3-cent-per-\ngallon gasoline tax, that immediately 4.3 cents per gallon would be \ntaken off of gasoline at the pump.\n  Let us look back a little bit to see if this logic will come true. \nAfter 1993, the 4.3-cent-per-gallon gasoline tax was collected, after \nwe placed the tax on and allocated this particular new tax, this new \nfee toward deficit reduction, not only did we start decreasing the \ndeficit, but we did something else. Gasoline prices came down. Gasoline \nprices came down after we placed the 4.3-cent user fee, in 1993, on \ngasoline. People do not talk about that very much right now, but that \nwas the case.\n  There is another concern that I had this morning in today's hearing \nin the Finance Committee. The people on the panel, who are very good \nadvocates for their constituent groups, for the truckers and the \nairlines, the service station owners, and all the rest, these \nindividuals came before the Senate Committee on Finance this morning \nand basically stated that, first, ``If you will repeal this gasoline \ntax, we're going to be able to spur the economy, we're going to be able \nto lower gasoline prices, we're going to be able to buy diesel for our \ntrucks at 4.3 cents per gallon less.''\n  But what was never stated, even though they were coming and saying, \n``Give us a break, give us some relief,'' they never stated--any of \nthem--how we were going to make up this loss of revenue. We collect \n$4.8 billion a year in this particular tax of 4.3 cents per gallon. Not \none of our witnesses this morning said, ``We have a way for you to \nprevent the deficit from rising dramatically if you repeal this \ngasoline tax.'' Not one of them. Not one witness this morning gave us \nan indication of how we are going to make up this shortfall.\n  I guess they were saying, ``Cut this tax out, let the deficit \nincrease,'' because they gave us no responsible alternative for making \nup the difference.\n\n[[Page S4664]]\n\n  There is something else that concerned me, Mr. President, about that \nparticular hearing. It was very, very partisan. It was extremely \npolitical. In fact, I commented that I did not know yet that the \nnominating conventions had started. I thought those were going to be in \nCalifornia and in Chicago come August, but it sounded like it was a \npolitical convention this morning in the Finance Committee. I am sorry \nit happened that way, but it did happen. You just have to take that on \nand take that as it is.\n  But what was not said also by any of our panelists, nor Members on \nthe other side of the aisle, I might say, is that some people's \nphilosophy is that you should not ask the Government to solve all of \nthe problems; that every time there is a problem, you do not seek \nGovernment intervention.\n  But this is what, on the other side of the aisle, we are being asked \nto do at this time in response to rising gas prices. By the way, there \nare some Senators on our side of the aisle who support the repeal of \nthe gasoline tax. Senator Baucus from Montana, for example, had a \nletter there and it stated his intent to vote for the repeal. I might \nvote for the repeal. I am not sure. I do not think I will. I might, if \nI can be shown where the consumers might benefit. But no one yet has \nshown us how the consumer is going to benefit to the tune of 4.3 cents \na gallon if we repeal the gasoline tax.\n  Here is what they also did not indicate this morning. They are coming \nto the Government for relief. Why do they not go to the oil companies \nfor relief? You say, ``Wait a minute, how can they go and seek relief \nfrom the oil companies?'' Here is how.\n  Let us look at the profits of, say, Shell, Amoco, Chevron, Texaco. In \nthe first quarter of 1996, Shell reported $483 million in profits \ncompared to $340 million in the first quarter of 1995. Amoco, $728 \nmillion in the first quarter this year compared to $523 million in the \nfirst quarter of 1995. Chevron, $616 million in the first quarter of \n1996 compared to $459 million in the first quarter of 1995. Texaco, \n$386 million in the first quarter of 1996 compared to $297 million in \nprofits in the first quarter of 1995.\n  That is an increase, for example, of $143 million that Shell gained \nover the first quarter of last year. That is a situation where Amoco \nlooks up here and all of a sudden the first quarter of this year, they \nhave made $205 million more in net profits than they made in the first \nquarter of 1995--$205 million.\n  That is where some relief can be given, because that is where the \nprice at the pump is determined, not with the 4.3-cent-a-gallon deficit \nreduction tax. The price at the pump, as the distinguished Presiding \nOfficer knows, is established by the oil companies as to what they \ncharge the retailer at the service station. That is where the price is \ndecided.\n\n  The gasoline company, the Texacos and Chevrons remit that tax to the \nGovernment, not the retailer, not the Chevron dealer who was there from \nPrince George's County this morning. The retailers do not do that. The \nbig oil companies collect and remit the tax, and I assume they charge a \nfee on top of the tax for collection and remission of the tax to the \nFederal Government.\n  This is the same tax that has increased our opportunity to deal with \nthe deficit numbers. Had we not had them, we perhaps would have been \n$30 billion more in debt.\n  Mr. President, I know that there are a lot of organizations in this \ntown that will steam up here in the next few days and weeks to repeal \nthe gas tax. But I might note that we also have the taxpayer bill of \nrights 2. On this side of the aisle, we have cleared the taxpayer bill \nof rights 2 to be passed. The second taxpayer bill of rights gives \nequity, uniformity, and fairness to the taxpayers of America on our \nside of the aisle, we say, ``Let's go with it.'' On the other side of \nthe aisle, ``Let's slow it up, because we may want to put this repeal \nof the gasoline tax on the taxpayer bill of rights.''\n  I hope they do not use that vehicle, because I think the taxpayers \nright now need to have that protection by the taxpayer bill of rights \n2. It has been a bipartisan effort. The distinguished Presiding \nOfficer, I think, has been a cosponsor of the taxpayer bill of rights. \nLet us not slow that down, and let us not speed up so quickly the \nstampeding to repeal the 4.3-cents-a-gallon gasoline tax unless we have \nthe assurance, the absolute ironclad assurance that should we do it, \nthe consumers are going to benefit and not the big oil companies.\n  Right now, it does not seem like the big oil companies have a great \ndeal of sympathy for the consumer when they are making 42 percent more \nprofit; 39 percent more profit; 34 percent more profit; 30 percent more \nprofit--Shell, Amoco, Chevron, Texaco, and on down the line. They are \nall awash in money.\n  They say, ``Well, the reason that those gasoline prices are having to \nbe increased right now''--you have heard them, Mr. President, you have \nwatched them on television and read them--the reason is because of all \nthese environmental standards that we have to meet; we are just having \nto take all of these profits and plow back in to increasing the \nenvironmental standards, and that is increasing our costs. Increase \ntheir costs? They are making 42 percent more profit than they did this \ntime last year, Mr. President, so that argument does not work.\n  They sound to me like the big pharmaceutical companies. They say, \n``Oh, we have to make this enormous profit''--the most profitable \nindustry in America today--``so we can do research.'' We pay them for \nresearch with research and development tax credits, and yet they are \ntrying to hornswoggle the public, take advantage of the consumers, \ngouge the elderly. They are trying to charge the very highest prices, \nand they are getting by with it. They are getting by with it, Mr. \nPresident. They are charging the American consumer 40 and 50 percent \nmore than that same drug is selling for across the border in Mexico and \nCanada and Great Britain, Europe--all over the world.\n  We subsidize them, we pay for it, and we pay for their product \nthrough the nose. It is not right, and before we rush to judgment on \nrepealing this 4.3 cent user fee, I just urge us to step back a little \nbit and say, ``Where are we going to make up the difference?'' Why can \nthe oil companies not use a little more sympathy, and if we repeal it, \nis this actually going to mean that the consumer is going to get a \nbreak? In my opinion, there is no evidence whatsoever, not one \nscintilla of evidence that the consumer is going to benefit from this \nparticular break.\n  Mr. President, in the Wall Street Journal, I think this morning--and, \nby the way, we had no economists, we had only advocates for the \nparticular constituencies there this morning--we said, ``Where are all \nthe economists? Why didn't they come? Why didn't we have someone to \nanswer this question? Are the consumers going to get the benefit of \nthis repeal if we do in fact repeal it, if we increase the deficit and \nrepeal the gasoline tax?''\n\n  Here is front page of the Wall Street Journal of this morning, Mr. \nPresident. It says, ``Don't Do It.'' I am going to quote:\n\n       Many economists say repealing the gasoline tax is wrong. \n     Federal Chairman Greenspan and board nominee Rivlin have \n     previously called for higher rates to discourage consumption \n     and balance the budget.\n\n  By the way, Mr. President, I am not calling for higher rates. I am \njust saying that with the rates we have, we should not be stampeded \ninto repealing them before we know what the results are going to be.\n\n       Berkeley Alan Auerbach calls the cut, ``A silly idea.''\n\n  Mr. President, that is the Wall Street Journal this morning. It is a \nvery conservative epistle, all of us know.\n  Mr. President, the distinguished majority leader, who is certainly a \nmember and former chairman of the Finance Committee, very distinguished \nMember of this body, Senator Dole of Kansas--Senator Dole was talking \nthis morning, today, and on the floor some this week, about the need to \nrepeal the gasoline tax.\n  You know, in 1982, only 1 day before Christmas Eve, December 23--we \nwere in session around here that particular time, and I kind of \nremember that time. I will read from a ``Dear Colleague'' letter from \nSenator Dole, at that time the chairman of the Senate Finance \nCommittee.\n  I am now quoting Senator Dole's ``Dear Colleague'' letter:\n\n       I urge you to vote for the [Surface Transportation Act of \n     1982]. . . . The bill increases the taxes on gasoline, diesel \n     fuel and other motor fuels from 4 to 9 cents per gallon. [A]n\n\n[[Page S4665]]\n\n     increase of 125 percent in the fuels taxes may look onerous . \n     . . This will only amount to a 4 percent increase in gasoline \n     prices and the new 9-cent tax will be significantly lower \n     relative to other consumer prices than the 4-cent tax was \n     when [that] was enacted in 1959.\n\n  It seems the newer environment or recent events have convinced \nSenator Dole that maybe gasoline taxes all of a sudden are not good, \nbecause a few years back he was supporting the gasoline tax.\n  Mr. President, there is also another part of our discussion this \nmorning--I am sure there has been on the floor--that historically the \nCongress, in enacting a gasoline tax, puts this into the highway trust \nfund. Historically that is the truth except for in 1990 and 1993. \nHistorically that is what the tradition has been.\n  But, Mr. President, we found in 1993 a most unique situation. We \nfound a deficit that had run wild that was out of control. We also \nfound that we had a President who was willing to take a risk, a \npolitical risk. Mr. President, it was a political risk. Every Democrat \non this side of the Senate Chamber voted for this particular package \nthat included 4.3 cents.\n  That 4.3 cents did not go to the highway trust fund. No, sir, it did \nnot. You are correct; it did not. But at that moment we had to do \nsomething, we had to do something drastic, and we had to do something \ndramatic. We had a very unique situation that we had to take care of. \nThe way that we started attacking it, Mr. President, was saying, OK, \nthis may not be traditional, this may be unique, this may be different, \nbut we are going to have to do it. We enacted the 4.3-cent gasoline \ntax.\n  As a result, we have cut the deficit, Mr. President. As a result, in \nmy opinion, the people go in to the service station and buy their \ngasoline, and if they think they are reducing the deficit with having \nto pay perhaps a little more, I think they are willing to do it. I may \nbe wrong, but I think they are willing to do it.\n  Our President took that opportunity. He accepted that challenge. He \nmet the mandate of the people to do something about the national debt \nand the deficit. It was hard. I tell you it was a hard vote to cast \nover here. It was an easy vote over there because not one of our good \ncolleagues on the other side--not one--voted for the package.\n  I can remember the hue and cry after that--``the biggest tax increase \nin American history,'' and all of that. I did not think it was. I think \nin retrospect the historians will look kindly upon those who took that \nrisk and who accepted that challenge that we had to do something to \nprotect and to begin to protect the future generations who are going to \nbe called upon to pay this huge deficit, this huge national debt. The \n1993 deficit reduction bill was a way to start.\n  To the best of my knowledge, the people out there--and I have not \nseen a poll on this, no sir--but to the best of my knowledge, the \npeople have said, ``If it goes for deficit reduction, if it will help \ndefray this onerous debt that is going to be on the backs of our \nchildren and grandchildren, I am willing to pay a little more.\n  Let me also state once again, as I opened, Mr. President, that when \nwe passed this 4.3-cent gasoline tax, the price of gasoline at the pump \nwent down.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a chart and other tables \nwhich give that statement credibility and which backs it up with the \nfacts be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       TABLE 9.4.--MOTOR GASOLINE RETAIL PRICES, U.S. CITY AVERAGE      \n                   [Cents per gallon, including taxes]                  \n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                   Leaded   Unleaded  Unleaded     All  \n                                   regular   regular   premium   types a\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n1973 average....................      38.8        NA        NA        NA\n1974 average....................      53.2        NA        NA        NA\n1975 average....................      56.7        NA        NA        NA\n1976 average....................      59.0      61.4        NA        NA\n1977 average....................      62.2      65.6        NA        NA\n1978 average....................      82.8      67.0        NA      65.2\n1979 average....................      86.7      90.3        NA      88.2\n1980 average....................     119.1     124.5        NA     122.1\n1981 b average..................     131.1    137.6c     147.0     135.2\n1982 average....................     122.2     128.6     141.6     128.1\n1983 average....................     115.7     124.1     138.2     122.5\n1984 average....................     112.8     121.2     136.6     119.6\n1985 average....................     111.6     120.2     134.0     119.6\n1986 average....................      85.7      92.7     108.5      93.1\n1987 average....................      69.7      94.8     108.3      95.7\n1988 average....................      89.9      94.6     110.7      96.3\n1989 average....................      98.8     102.1     119.7     106.0\n1990 average....................     114.3     116.4     134.9     121.7\n1991 average....................

Mr. President, I am going to sit down in just a moment. I \nknow my good friend from North Dakota, Senator Dorgan, is now on the \nfloor. But you are going to hear an awful lot now because it is 1996--\nit is an even-numbered year--it is getting ready to be the last \nelection of this century, and it is going to be a humdinger. It is \ngoing to be the one that we are going to tell our grandchildren and \ngreat-grandchildren about, because it is going to get pretty exciting.\n  We are going to hear an awful lot about the 1993 economic plan, that \nit was the biggest tax increase in history, will ruin the country, \nwhatever. I think we might start now setting that record straight. Look \nat the Wall Street Journal, October 26, 1994. I quote the Wall Street \nJournal:\n\n       Contrary to Republican claims, the 1993 package is not the \n     largest tax increase in history. The 1982 deficit-reduction \n     package of President Reagan and Senator Robert Dole in a GOP \n     controlled Senate was a bigger tax bill, both in 1993 \n     adjusted dollars and as a percentage of the overall economy.\n\n  The Wall Street Journal, not exactly a left-wing, Democratic \nnewspaper, Mr. President.\n  Let us look at the Washington Post, February 1, 1995, recently and I \nquote:\n\n       The biggest tax increase in history did not occur in the \n     Omnibus Reconciliation Act of 1993. The biggest increase in \n     post-World War II history occurred in 1982, under President \n     Ronald Reagan.\n\n  Mr. President, part of Senator Dole's historic tax increase was in \nfact a 5-cent gasoline tax.\n  Let us look at November 3, 1995, Mr. President, not long ago.\n\n       It is not true that the $240 billion tax increase approved \n     by Congress in 1993, at Mr. Clinton's behest, is the largest \n     in American history. When adjusted for inflation--the only \n     way to make comparisons of dollar amounts from different \n     years--a tax increase endorsed by Mr. Dole, in 1982, when he \n     was chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, was larger.\n\n  So, Mr. President, as we hear a lot of these statements made on this \nfloor of this great institution, in the U.S. Senate, over the next \nseveral months up until the election, I think from time to time it \nbehooves us well to come to this floor and to respond and set the facts \nout and set the record straight. f\n  That is the purpose of my visit here this morning. I think as we go \nforward in the next several weeks, as this debate intensifies, it will \nbe our obligation to come forward and spread the facts as to what the \nreal story is on the record.\n  I thank the Chair. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Are we in morning business?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. We are.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/05/03/senate-section/article/S4663-2", "month": "05", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "03", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4666-S4668]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              THE GAS TAX\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I will add a few comments to the comments \noffered by Senator Pryor from Arkansas and the comments offered by \nSenator Daschle, the minority leader. We have this morning seen a work \ncrew of seven U.S. Senators trudge to the floor of the Senate and \ndutifully describe that all ills in America, present, past and future \nshould be laid at the doorstep of the current President of the United \nStates, President Clinton.\n  I listened to see if I could find the ultimate charge, maybe that \nwould be that the President is responsible for the Andromeda Galaxy \nthat is racing at 4,500 miles an hour toward the Milky Way, of course, \nwhich is where we live. A galaxy three times the size of ours is racing \nat us 4,500 miles an hour, and most estimate, I think there is no \ndisagreement, that when it hits us it will destroy our galaxy and us in \nabout 4 to 5 billion years. Perish the thought. But if there is a \nSenate at some point in the future, someone will come and probably try \nto lay that at the footsteps of the current incumbent President. They \ndid not quite get that far this morning, but close, close enough.\n  The proposal this morning was we should cut the 4.3-cent gas tax. \nThat may get done. I am not crazy about the gas tax because I come from \na State that is a large State with very few people. The gas tax costs \nus twice as much per person as it costs people who live in New York \nbecause they do not drive as far as we do for much of anything. I \nmentioned the other day I have a friend from New York who described for \nme once she and her family were going to leave Yonkers, NY, I think, or \nBrooklyn, or one of those areas, and drive to New Jersey to see an aunt \nand an uncle. It was 60 or 80 miles, I guess. So they packed an \nemergency kit for their trunk and put blankets in the trunk, took food \nalong and got all squared away to take the 70 mile drive, because those \nwho live in New York do not drive 70 miles very often. It is a big\n\n[[Page S4667]]\n\ndrive to see the relatives. In North Dakota, we drive 70 miles at the \ndrop of the hat and think nothing of it.\n  I am not a big fan of the gas tax. It affects us twice as much as it \naffects New Yorkers. However, the question seems to me, if we are going \nto repeal the 4.3 cents, how about repealing the 10-cent previous to \nthat that Senator Dole had supported? Why not make it 14.3 cents? Or if \nyou repeal the 4.3 cents, ask the question, in whose pockets will the \n4.3 cents go? The consumers, taxpayers, the people that drive to the \npump to buy gasoline, or in the pockets of the oil industry?\n  When we vote on whatever this proposal will be, and we may pass a \n4.3-cent gas cut--we may do that--we also will vote on an amendment \nthat I offered that says let us guarantee, if we will do this, \nguarantee that this goes in the right pocket. There is a big pocket and \nthere are small pockets, high pockets and low pockets. Make sure it \ngoes in the right pocket.\n  I can see what could happen and you can too, I am sure. You cut the \ngas tax 4.3 cents a gallon, drive to the gas pump to fill up your car, \nand the price is the same. What happened? The oil companies pocketed \nthe difference. Anything wrong with that? No, they can do that under \nthe current circumstance. It does not matter what the gas tax is. They \ncan price gas the way they want to price tax. If we are going to do \nthat and do this because we decide we do not want to build roads or \nimprove bridges or reduce the deficit, if we are going to do it, make \nsure the money goes in the right pocket. We will have a chance to vote \non an amendment and see whether we are doing it to put it in the right \npocket or whether some do it and not care which pocket it goes in.\n\n  This is not an idle issue. I do not blame anyone who wants to come to \nthe floor and talk about taxes. It would be nice if taxes were lower \nfor everyone at all times. I have some disagreement with a Senator who \ncame to the floor yesterday to say until the day I was free of paying \ntaxes I am not doing anything for myself. I have some problem with that \nbecause what does he think he is doing with the money he is paying to \nsend his kids to school? Part of his tax bill is to build the school \nand pay the teacher and help send his kids to get educated. Is that not \nan investment for him and his family? Part of the tax is to pay for the \ncaptains, cruisers, jet airplanes and others in the Defense Department \nto protect the country. Is that not an investment in himself or this \ncountry? Part of his investment is in Social Security and Medicare and \nMedicaid.\n  I just described the four biggest areas of public spending: \nEducation, Medicare, Medicaid, health care, and defense. The four \nbiggest areas of public spending. The question is, how much of each do \nyou want? How much do you want to spend on defense? How much are you \nwilling to spend and do you want to spend on Medicare and Medicaid? How \nmuch do you want to spend to have a Social Security system that works? \nThat is the question for Members of Congress to answer. Should we try \nto minimize the tax burden at all times? Absolutely. Should we \nreconcile the amount of money we have with our appetite to spend it? \nYes. It is one thing to say stand up here and talk of cutting taxes, \nbut another thing to talk about what the taxes are being used for and \nwhat we want the Federal deficit to be.\n  Now, if they propose to cut the gas tax, the first step would be to \nmake sure it does not increase the Federal deficit. I think all of us \nbelieve that we ought to keep ratcheting down the Federal deficit, and \nit has come down for whatever reason one might want to ascribe to that. \nThe Federal deficit has decreased rather dramatically in the last 3 \nyears. We ought to keep it going in the same direction.\n\n  Some will say, the President ought to get the blame for everything \nthat is wrong but not get the credit for something that is right. That \nis probably not a fair assessment of what should happen to a President. \nThe fact is, the deficit has come down and some of that is to the \ncredit of this President and to those in Congress who in 1993 voted to \nboth cut spending and raise some additional revenue in order to bring \nthat deficit down.\n  If someone now proposes that we should have a tax cut of one type or \nanother, then it seems to me we ought to make sure that tax cut does \nnot increase the Federal deficit, first of all. Maybe that can be done. \nSecond, we ought to make sure that the benefit of a tax cut goes to \nthose that we talk about here on the floor of the Senate.\n  It is interesting, we talk about middle-income people, a lot of folks \ntalk about the people at the bottom of the economic ladder, the folks \nin the middle, middle-income Americans. I brought to the floor a \ndiscussion about middle income that I thought was the most interesting \ndiscussion last year. We were talking about safety nets and investments \nand spending programs and education and all the things, and how it \naffects various groups, and who is proposing to cut taxes and who \nbenefits from that.\n  A Member of the House of Representatives, in a newspaper said the \nfollowing about middle-class, and his salary of $135,000 plus the \n$50,000 he gets in a police pension, ``does not make me rich, that \ndoesn't make me middle class. In my opinion, that makes me lower middle \nclass.'' This is a GOP Congressman from over in the House. He said, \n``When I see someone who is making anywhere from $300,000 to $750,000 a \nyear, that's middle class. When I see anyone above that I think that is \nupper middle class.'' So, I read this, I scratch my head, and I think, \nhere is someone serving in Congress that defines middle class as \nsomeone who makes between $300,000 and $750,000 a year. Then I \nunderstand why the policies this person proposed, he can claim are to \nbenefit the middle class. I guess they are policies to benefit those \nwho make from between $300,000 and $750,000 a year.\n  In my hometown, I guess we do not have any middle class. We do not \nhave anybody that reaches $300,000 to $750,000 a year in income. That \nis not middle class. He knows better than that, I am sure. He said it \nin the middle of this debate about who you are trying to help. Some of \nthe discussion on the floor of the Senate with respect to the gas tax \nand others is that we need to make sure that those at the lower end of \nthe economic ladder or those in the middle class are helped. There is \nanxiety out there, and I understand that. Here is a newspaper clipping \nthat says, ``CEO's at Major Corporations Got a 23 Percent Raise in \n1995.'' So we have an economic ladder, and if you reach the top of the \neconomic ladder, apparently, you get to keep floating up, because at \nthe top you get a 23-percent salary increase in 1995. At the bottom of \nthe economic ladder, if you are working for the minimum wage, you are \npart of 40 percent of the people who work for the minimum wage, and you \nare the sole income for your family, you have no raise and you did not \nget 23 percent. You did not get 15 or 10 percent--you did not get 1 \npercent. You sure did not get the 23 percent that the CEO's of \nAmerica's corporations got. You got zero.\n\n  That is part of the reason some of us have said, ``Let us, this year, \ntalk about an adjustment in the minimum wage.'' Is it not fair for \nthose on the bottom rung of the economic ladder to also have an \nadjustment of some type? We are not saying make a dramatic wholesale \nchange in the minimum wage. We are saying that when the bottom rung has \nbeen frozen for 5 years, without a 1-percent increase, it is time to \nmake a reasonable, thoughtful adjustment for the bottom rung of that \nladder.\n  I mentioned, when I began to discuss the gas tax briefly, that you \nhave some of the same circumstances with respect to the economics of \nthat circumstance. The major oil companies have done really quite well. \nChevron had a 34-percent gain from last year; Amoco, up 39 percent; \nTexaco, up 30 percent, Mobil, up 16 percent. I do not begrudge them \nthat. I want them to do fine. I want them to find more oil, and I want \nmore oil to be available. I want us to be able to have oil prices that \nare reasonable for drivers in this country. But when you see this, and \nyou see prices spike up at the gas pump by 20 cents, and you see folks \nbusting in the door of the Senate and saying the problem is apparently \na gas tax that was applied 3 years ago, it seems to me there is a \ndisconnection. If 4.3 cents is some magic figure because that is what \nPresident Clinton proposed in 1993, why not up it another dime and make \nit 14.3 cents?\n\n[[Page S4668]]\n\n That includes President Clinton's and Senator Dole's gas tax \nproposals, and what they voted for. Just do the whole 14.3 cents, and \nwhile it is being done, make sure of two things: First, do not increase \nthe deficit; and second, make sure it goes in the right pockets.\n  I am also going to offer another amendment I hope the Senate will \naccept somewhere along the way. As long as we are going to talk about \ntaxes--it is hard to offer an amendment on taxes because we do not get \nbills dealing with the revenue code on the floor of the Senate very \noften. Normally, when you offer it, you have to offer it to something \nelse because you do not have the vehicle. If we are going to have a tax \nbill on the floor of the Senate, it would be my intention to offer, \nagain, a very, very simple piece of legislation, and that is, let us \nend deferral in the Tax Code to allow corporations to move their jobs \nand their plants overseas, make the same product they made while they \nwere here in America, and ship the product back to our country, and in \nour Tax Code they now have the opportunity to pay zero in income taxes.\n\n  In other words, we have in our Tax Code a $2.3 billion incentive, in \n7 years, to say to people and companies, ``We will make you a deal. If \nyou will close your American factory, get rid of your American workers, \nmove overseas to a foreign country, make the same product and ship it \nback to America, we will give you a tax break, we will pay you to do \nit; we will pay you $2.3 billion to do it.''\n  Now, if this country cannot take the first baby step in deciding that \nif there are incentives, there ought to be incentives for providing \njobs in this country, and jobs should not be moving from this country \nto another country, paid for with incentives in our Tax Code that say \nto companies that if you do it, we will give you a break--if we cannot \ntake a baby step to change that, nobody should dare stand up here on \nthe Senate floor and say, ``I am for jobs in America.'' We ought not to \nbe export neutral where jobs are concerned. You will not find much \namong academicians or economists on that point. So $2.3 billion exists \nas a reward for companies to move their jobs overseas. If we are going \nto have a tax bill on the floor of the Senate, let us have a tax bill \nthat fixes that problem as well.\n  I offered that last year on the floor of the Senate while debating \nanother issue. And I lost on a near party line vote. It was 52 to 48, I \nbelieve. I indicated then I intended to raise this issue when a tax \nbill comes to the floor of the Senate, and I will raise this issue \nagain, because I do not think it makes economic sense for our country \nto pay for moving jobs from America to foreign countries.\n  Mr. President, this will be a year in which I assume there will be \nplenty of rhetoric on the Senate floor about a lot of things--some on \nour side, some on the majority side. There will be huffing and puffing \non both sides. I understand that. There will be claims and \ncounterclaims. Both sides will build word castles in the air about \ntheir particular program and how awful the other side is. The plain \nfact is that this place will work if we can find a way to sift through \nsome of that and decide that there are things that we will agree on and \nadvance those pieces of legislation.\n\n  Last night, we passed an immigration bill. There were a lot of \namendments to it. I supported a number of them and opposed others. But \nwe passed it with very close to a unanimous vote. I think only three \nMembers voted against it. We passed an antiterrorist bill a couple of \nweeks ago. We passed a significant health bill 100 to 0. As all of the \npositioning and jockeying goes on, there are things we can and should \ndo. I am not coming here today to say that drivers in this country, \ntaxpayers in this country, ought not to be relieved of some of their \nburdens. That is fine. I would like to find a way to bring the tax bill \nfor all Americans down as far as we can reduce it. I would like to find \na way to squeeze every single bit of Government waste out of this \nsystem--and there is plenty. I want to make sure that what we do is \ngrounded in good economic sense. I want to make sure that what we do \nprovides as their beneficiaries the American people. There are laws of \nunintended consequences in this Chamber, where we do a whole series of \nthings that are alleged to accomplish one thing and end up \naccomplishing something very, very different.\n  The gas tax is a very simple proposition. I do not know whether it is \ngoing to pass or not pass in this Chamber. I do know this: If it does \npass, the only merit it has for the American people--passing a \nreduction of the gas tax--is if it goes in their pocket, not in the \npockets of the oil industry. That is something all of us, as we debate \nthis, ought to make certain will occur.\n  I want to make one final point today. There have been seven speakers \non the other side, and I understand that. That is the way the works. \nSenator Daschle and Senator Pryor and I are not coming to the floor \nsimply to say it is all unfair. These are fair discussions of public \nissues, and where better to have them discussed than on the floor of \nthe Senate. As we proceed down the road on the issue of trying to put \ntogether a budget for fiscal year 1997, I hearken back to the impasse \nand gridlock we had last year, and the gridlock that some predict will \noccur this year, and simply observe this. David Gergen, who worked \nfirst for Republicans and then Democrats--I think he served in \nPresident Reagan's administration, President Bush's administration, and \nthe Clinton administration--wrote a piece for the U.S. News & World \nReport. In it, he said something I think is very important. I hope all \nof us can pay some attention to this year in order to avoid the \ngridlock we had last year. He said: ``Ronald Reagan, as President, \ninsisted that there be a safety net, even as we cut Federal spending.'' \nHe said, ``How soon we forget that, as President, Ronald Reagan \ninsisted that seven key programs be in the safety net. Head Start, \nMedicare, Social Security, veterans, SSI, school lunches, and summer \njobs for youth, would not be touched.''\n\n  ``Now,'' Gergen says, ``six of those seven are under the budget \nknife.''\n  The point is that, as we try to establish priorities, I hope all of \nus understand, as President Reagan understood, we need a safety net for \nsome people.\n  Summer jobs for disadvantaged youth. Is that important? Yes, I think \nit is. Let us measure that against some other things and decide that \nthat is a safety net for vulnerable people.\n  Head Start. Let us decide not to tell 60,000 Head Start kids that we \ncannot afford you anymore. Let us be able to tell 3-, 4-, and 5-year-\nolds that there is a place in Head Start for you because we know that \nprogram works and improves your lives, and it saves this country money \nwhen it invests in young children. Let us take a look at what Ronald \nReagan said in the early 1980's about a safety net, as we cut spending \nand chop spending in some areas where it deserves to be chopped. Let us \nalso make sure that we have the right set of priorities with the people \nwho need some help and need to have the comfort of a safety net because \nthey do not have other opportunities.\n  Mr. President, with that, I yield the floor, and I make the point of \norder that a quorum is not present.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Grams). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/05/03/senate-section/article/S4666-1", "month": "05", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "03", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4668-S4669]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          AGRICULTURAL POLICY\n\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, much has been reported lately about the \nsituation facing America's farmers and ranchers. Carryover stocks for \nsome grains are at their lowest levels since the 1940's--causing record \nhigh grain prices.\n  I think, in fact, that wheat is up to about $8 a bushel. There is \nonly one problem. In our State, nobody has very much wheat. In fact, \nsome have none at all. The $8 price is good, but it does not really \nreflect that it is going to be benefiting very many producers in the \nState of Kansas and other States in the Midwest.\n  Meanwhile, cattle supplies are at a 10-year high causing extremely \nlow cattle prices. Last year, the average FED steer sold for $80 per \nhundredweight, while today's bids are at $55 per hundredweight.\n  I have always argued the best farm policy is the marketplace. If \nfarmers received a fair price for their products,\n\n[[Page S4669]]\n\nthey would not need any Federal dollars. This year, Congress passed a \nfarm bill which finally took the Government out of the farming and \nranching business.\n  The Federal Agricultural Improvement Act significantly reduces the \nGovernment's role in pricing, marketing, and planting decisions of \nfarmers and ranchers. No longer will the Government tell farmers what \nand how much to plant.\n  Three days ago, the President held a meeting to discuss the situation \nnow facing the cattle industry. Unfortunately, the Clinton \nadministration has helped contribute to the troubles of cattle \nranchers.\n  While Mother Nature is largely responsible for low carryover grain \nstocks, the Clinton administration announced a program which idled \nnearly 5 million corn acres in 1995. In other words, the administration \ntold farmers that Washington is better at making planting decisions \nthan they are.\n   Mr. President, idling 5 million corn acres is the same as idling 1 \nyear of corn production in the State of Ohio--one of our Nation's most \nimportant Corn Belt States.\n  In fact, under the Republican farm bill, this year's corn plantings \nare expected to increase by 15 percent over last year. Farmers are \nfinally planting for the marketplace and not for the Government.\n\n  As grain prices have risen, farmers have asked for an early out on \ntheir conservation reserve program contracts, in order to respond to a \ngrowing world demand for American grain.\n  It is estimated that 9 of the 36 million acres in the CRP are not \nenvironmentally sensitive. Even though the administration had the \nauthority to respond in time for planting, they refused to do so. In \nfact, every time the administration has announced an early out for CRP \nacres, it has been too late for spring planting. Several of my \ncolleagues have joined me in expressing concern about the European beef \nhormone ban. For years, there had been no action from the Clinton White \nHouse. Suddenly when beef prices hit a 10 year low, the administration \nfiles a WTO case. I am encouraged that the administration has finally \ntaken notice of this issue.\n  But the administration cannot have it both ways. Administration \nofficials have repeatedly criticized the beef industry. Secretary of \nthe Interior Bruce Babbitt has led the Clinton administration's war on \nthe west.\n  The administration has raised grazing fees without input from \nCongress. They have locked land away from reasonable development and \nmultiuse management. They have devalued property without compensation. \nWorst of all, they are trying to manage this land from Washington.\n  Through Government manipulation of the markets and a series of \nharmful decisions, the administration has worsened the crises now \nfacing farmers and ranchers.\n  As I travel the country, I am reminded by farmers and ranchers that \nthey are taxpayers too. And as taxpayers, they want less of Washington \nin their everyday lives.\n  Despite all the rhetoric from the other side of the aisle, \nRepublicans have passed a farm bill that will prepare farmers and \nranchers for the 21st century.\n  This farm bill provides farmers and ranchers with more flexibility, \nmore certainty, and far less Government involvement in the agricultural \nindustry. America's farmers and ranchers want less Government intrusion \nin their production and marketing decisions. It is high time the \nClinton administration heeds their call.\n  Notwithstanding considerable Democratic opposition, this was a \nbipartisan bill. In fact, Senator Lugar and Senator Leahy stood here on \nthe floor and managed the bill in a bipartisan way, and on the House \nside there was bipartisan support. That effort was led by my colleague \nfrom Kansas, Congressman Pat Roberts, chairman of the House Agriculture \nCommittee, who I believe will be joining other colleagues in the Senate \nnext year.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/05/03/senate-section/article/S4668-1", "month": "05", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "03", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4669-S4670]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       BALANCED BUDGET AMENDMENT\n\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, there is probably no more important matter \nthat we have discussed in the last year and 3 months than the issue of \nthe balanced budget amendment to the Constitution.\n  Last year the House of Representatives passed the balanced budget \namendment by more than two-thirds vote required. We had several long \nweeks of debate here in the Senate before the amendment narrowly failed \non a vote of 65 to 35 on March 2, 1995.\n  As leader, I changed my vote so that I could reconsider the matter \nlater, which I could do now, or next week, or next month, or sometime \nbefore the year is out. So we are one vote short--that is the point I \nam making--in the Senate.\n  I continue to hope that we can resolve the balanced budget amendment \nissue and pass it this year.\n  To help us get to that goal, I have asked Senators Craig, Hatch, and \nDomenici to sit down with colleagues on the other side of the aisle in \nthe coming days to see where accommodation is possible on the balanced \nbudget amendment.\n  I have never thought this was a partisan issue. In fact, I have been \naround here for some time, and it has been discussed and supported by \nDemocrats and Republicans in the U.S. Senate over the past several \nyears, and it is now. Many Democrats voted for the amendment last year, \nand we would like to have a couple more. We would like to have 8, or 10 \nmore.\n  Several Senators who changed their votes last year talked about a \nSocial Security firewall. I think there are ways to add a provision to \nthe balanced budget amendment that will ensure that Social Security \nsurpluses can never again be used to mask deficit spending.\n  Make no mistake, the amendment will still require that the Federal \nbudget be balanced by the year 2002. That is our promise to the \nAmerican people. And I believe we can also require that, after a \nsuitable phase-in, the Federal budget be balanced without counting the \nsurpluses in the Social Security trust funds.\n  I am optimistic that we have an opportunity to pass the balanced \nbudget amendment with broad bipartisan support in the U.S. Senate. \nSenator Simon has been a leader in this important effort from the very \nbeginning. I have directed our side to work with the Democrats and I \nwould hope several of those Senators who changed their votes last year \ncan come home again and support the balanced budget amendment as they \nhave in the past.\n  It is no small accomplishment that all of us now agree that the \nbudget should be balanced by the year 2002. That is a big change since \nlast March. It is not just Republicans saying it now, but all of us--\nfrom Republicans to blue dog Democrats to the President of the United \nStates.\n  I believe that in itself is good news for America. Since we all agree \nthat we ought to do this by the year 2002, one way to underscore our \ndetermination and convince the American people we are serious is to \npass the constitutional amendment for a balanced budget that will \nrequire that we do it by the year 2002.\n  So I do not give up hope that we can finally pass the balanced budget \namendment and send it to the States for ratification. Remember that our \naction here is not the end of the line. The final decision about \nwhether or not the balanced budget amendment will go into effect \nreverts to those outside Washington where most people would like to \nhope or think the decisions are made--with the States and with State \nlegislators, with Governors, the American people, the taxpayers in each \nof the 50 States in America.\n  The Founding Fathers decided to give the ultimate authority over \nconstitutional amendments to those who are closest to the people, the \nmen and women who serve in State houses around the country. So if we \nget a two-thirds vote for a balanced budget constitutional amendment in \nthe Senate and the House, it then does not go to the President because \nhe has nothing to do with it; it goes to the States, where if three-\nfourths of the States ratify the constitutional amendment within a \ncertain time period, it becomes part of the Constitution of the United \nStates.\n  It has always seemed to me we should not be making judgments in an \nimportant area like balancing the budget; that we should bring in the \nStates and bring in the State legislators, Republican or Democrat. They\n\n[[Page S4670]]\n\nare closer to the people. They can better reflect the views of the \npeople. And, again, if three-fourths of the States ratify the action by \nCongress and ratify the amendment, it becomes part of the Constitution.\n  So why not go through the constitutional process that our Founding \nFathers so wisely set up? There is a word for that process, and that \nword is democracy. That is what it is all about: Democracy. Let us let \ndemocracy work. No more excuses, no more obstacles. Eighty percent of \nthe American people want a balanced budget amendment to the \nConstitution. By passing the amendment, we can balance the budget by \nthe year 2002. We can protect the Social Security trust funds, and we \nwill have done the single most important thing we can do to ensure the \nNation's economic security and to protect the American dream for our \nchildren and grandchildren.\n  Now, having said this, it is my hope that we can start this process \nsometime this next week. As I said, there is no issue more important. \nEighty percent of the American people wonder why we have not done it by \nnow. We failed by one vote. Six of my colleagues who had voted for it \nthe year before, voted against it last year. Maybe they will come back \nhome. We will do our best to accommodate some of the concerns that some \nof my colleagues have raised on the other side of the aisle, if we can \nwork out some accommodations.\n\n  Let us take this out of politics. Let us tell the American people it \nis bipartisan, as it is, with Senator Simon the leader on the \nDemocratic side, Senator Craig and Senator Hatch, Senator Domenici, and \nothers on this side of the aisle. So we hope that we can find a \nsolution next week, start on this next week and maybe complete action \nthe following week.\n  There is nothing more important. And I hope that we can come \ntogether, as we should, to do the right thing for the American people, \nthe American taxpayers and our future generations.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/05/03/senate-section/article/S4669-1", "month": "05", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "03", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4670]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     REPEAL OF THE 4.3-CENT GAS TAX\n\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, finally, let me say a word with reference to \nthe Finance Committee hearing that was held this morning on repeal of \nthe gas tax, the 4.3-cent gas tax, which was made permanent in 1993 in \nthe Clinton tax bill, which raised taxes by $265 billion, the gas tax \nincrease contributes about $4.8 billion a year.\n  Not a single Republican voted for the big, big, big tax increase, the \nlargest tax increase in the history of America. In fact, I think one of \nmy colleagues said, ``No, in the history of the world.'' Whatever, it \nwas big. It has had an impact on the economy. Only once before--in \n1990--did Congress ever vote to have a gas tax to pay for deficit \nreduction. Gas taxes were always set aside in a trust fund to build \nhighways, bridges, and whatever.\n  That is a very worthy purpose, and that is why motorists and others \nwho use fuel are prepared to pay that tax to have better roads, better \nhighways, and better bridges. But in 1993, in the $265 billion Clinton \ntax increase, which included a 4.3-cent increase in gas taxes, which \nwas an increase of about 25 to 30 percent in the Federal gas tax, \ninstead of dedicating the funds to bridges, highways, and whatever, it \nis being used for deficit reduction.\n  Gas prices are spiraling. They have gone up 30 cents in the State of \nCalifornia, for example--15 cents, 20 cents in most other States.\n  Will repeal of this gas tax mean the price of gas will fall? Not \nnecessarily. If we repeal the gas tax, we are certain they are going to \nbe 4 cents less than they were before. We should not be raising taxes. \nWe ought to be cutting spending. The American people want us to cut \nspending, not raise taxes, whether it is a gas tax or some other tax on \nthe American people, American consumers, particularly low-income \nAmericans.\n\n  So it is my hope--in fact, on Tuesday of next week, I will introduce \nlegislation, along with Senator Gramm, who will be the principal \nsponsor, along with Members of the House, to repeal the gas tax--repeal \nthe gas tax and remind the American people that this is the beginning, \nthis is the beginning.\n  Remember, without a Republican vote, the Democrats in the House and \nSenate passed a $265-billion tax increase in 1993 that President \nClinton wanted. We believe this is one small step we can take. It \namounts to about $4.8 billion a year. We will find offsets, and they \nwill not be tax increases. We will try to relieve the consumers and the \nmotorists of at least that part of the burden on the Federal gas tax. \nIt is going to go to the consumers. We cannot predict that prices may \nnot rise because if there is no supply, prices will rise. But, as I \nhave said, they will at least be 4.3 cents cheaper than they were \nbefore.\n  I believe there will be strong bipartisan support for repeal, and we \nhope to have that legislation ready and on the Senate floor in the very \nnear future.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. WARNER addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I wish to commend the distinguished \nmajority leader, and I shall join with him and ask if I may be a \ncosponsor of that legislation.\n  Mr. President, this is a tax put on gasoline that does not go to the \nimprovement of the Nation's highway transportation system. When a \ndriver moves up to the pump and pays the tax, which could be as high as \n18 Federal, those taxes historically have gone to improve America's \ntransportation--roads and bridges--but not in this case. President \nClinton designed this tax to go elsewhere.\n  I commend the distinguished majority leader. This Clinton tax must be \nrepealed and repealed promptly. And henceforth, when you go to the gas \npump, whatever tax it is, that tax must be directed toward the \nimprovement of the transportation system. Those are the users in those \nautomobiles and those trucks, and they are entitled to those funds to \nbe expended for the very roads on which they must drive and work to \nsupport their families.\n\n  I thank the Chair. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Virginia.\n  I hope to be meeting with him tomorrow on this very important issue.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/05/03/senate-section/article/S4670-1", "month": "05", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "03", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4670-S4672]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                WHITE HOUSE TRAVEL OFFICE REIMBURSEMENT\n\n  Mr. DOLE.

Let me indicate, as I will do in the closing statement, \nthere will be no votes today. There will be no votes on Monday. The \nfirst vote will occur at 2:15 p.m. on Tuesday, May 7.\n  Let me also indicate, it is necessary to go through this procedure of \nfilling up the tree so we can take action on this bill without having \nnongermane amendments offered to it. I would indicate we have made a \nproposal to the Democratic leadership with reference to minimum wage. I \nhave asked Senator Lott to try to resolve that with Senator Daschle and \nothers. We hope they can reach some agreement so we can start bringing \nup legislation and passing it. This bill should not take 5 minutes. It \nmay take 2 or 3 days. But I hope that is not the case.\n  I know there was some misinformation about the Senator from Arkansas, \nSenator Pryor, holding up the bill. That is not accurate. He did raise \nsome questions last night about how we might treat other people who had \nthe same problem, where they have incurred big legal expenses through \nno fault of their own because they have been called to testify or \nbecause of something being investigated. I suggested, rather than try \nto cure that on this bill, that we ask the chairman of the Judiciary \nCommittee if he would consider general legislation, if he would take a \nlook at it--it might be Whitewater, it might be Iran-Contra--because I \ncan tell you, a lot of people in this country have incurred huge legal \nbills when they were called before committees and their reputation was \nat stake and when they were really not even under investigation or \ntargets of investigation. That has been true through the years.\n  So, if we want to change general policy, I suggest we do it through \nthe process of hearings in the appropriate committee. I hope that will \nbe satisfactory and that we can pass this bill quickly on Tuesday and \nmove on to a couple of other bills--Amtrak authorization, which we \nbelieve is very important, and the firefighters discrimination bill, S. \n849--and, hopefully, then, on Wednesday, go to the constitutional \namendment for a balanced budget.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/05/03/senate-section/article/S4672-2", "month": "05", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "03", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4672]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. DOLE.

Mr. President, yesterday the U.S. Trade Representative \nreleased its annual Special 301 report on the protection of U.S. \nintellectual property rights [IPR] by foreign countries. It will come \nas no surprise to my\n\n[[Page S4673]]\n\ncolleagues that topping the list of countries which routinely permit \nthe pirating of American IPR is the People's Republic of China [PRC]. \nIn fact, the PRC is the only country identified as a ``priority foreign \ncountry,'' meaning that its policies and practices--or lack thereof--\nhave had the greatest adverse impact on American goods.\n  The Subcommittee on East Asian and Pacific Affairs, which I chair, \nhas held three hearings on this issue. Let me share a little of what \nthe subcommittee has learned from those hearings with my colleagues. \nSection 301 of the Trade Act of 1974 is the principal mechanism through \nwhich an administration addresses unfair foreign trade practices. \nSection 301 gives the President broad powers to enforce U.S. rights \nunder bi- and multi-lateral trade agreements, and to seek to eliminate \nacts or policies of foreign governments that burden or restrict U.S. \ncommerce. In addition, it authorizes the President to retaliate against \nsuch practices if negotiations to eliminate the objectionable practice \nfail.\n  The Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act of 1988 amended the Trade \nAct of 1974 to include what has been commonly called the Special 301 \nprovision. Special 301 requires the U.S. Trade Representative [USTR] to \nidentify on an annual basis those countries that, inter alia, deny \nadequate and effective protections for IPR; and those countries within \nthat category determined by the USTR to be priority foreign countries. \nSuch countries are those that ``have the most onerous or egregious \n[policies].''\n  Section 302(b) of the 1974 act directs the USTR to initiate a Section \n301 investigation within 30 days after a country is identified as a \npriority. After such an investigation is initiated, the USTR is \nrequired to determine within 6 months if the country engages in unfair \ntrade practices and if any retaliatory measures should be imposed. \nInvestigations may be extended 9 months if complex or complicated \nissues are involved. At the end of the investigation, the USTR has the \ndiscretion in deciding whether to retaliate.\n  As a means of increasing the effectiveness of the Special 301 \nprovision, the USTR has divided into two lists those countries \nperceived to be denying adequate and effective IPR protection but whose \nproblems are not as pronounced as priority countries: the priority \nwatch list [PWL], and the ``watch list'' [WL]. Countries placed on the \nPWL are those the USTR considers to have made less progress in \nstrengthening IPR protection than those on the WL. These countries are \nconsidered to have practices that meet all or some of the statutory \ncriteria for placement on the priority country list, but are seen as \nmaking progress in negotiations to improve their IPR protection. WL \ncountries are those that the USTR believes to have better IPR \nprotection, but still need to be monitored.\n  USTR completed the first Special 301 review of foreign countries' \nprotection of IPR in April 1989. In that year and in 1990, the USTR \nplaced the PRC on its priority watch list, citing a lack of protection \nof IPR and enforcement of intellectual property laws. IPR piracy in \nthe People's Republic of China [PRC] was rampant, especially in the \nsouthern and eastern provinces close to Hong Kong such as Guangdong and \nJiangsu. Factories in these areas mass-produced pirated versions of \nAmerican computer software, compact discs, CD-ROMs, and audio/video \ncassettes. Of the American computer software sold or produced in China, \nover 94 percent was pirated; many Government ministries--including the \nTrade Ministry--made extensive use of pirated software. CD's and audio/\nvideo percentages ran close to 100 percent; video copies of movies were \nbeing exported in China even before being released in the United \nStates. Trademark piracy was also prolific.\n\n  Consequently, in 1991 the PRC was designated a priority foreign \ncountry. In January 1992, the People Republic of China and United \nStates signed a memorandum of understanding governing IPR protection. \nPursuant to the MOU, the PRC enacted a comprehensive body of laws \nprotecting IPR, and providing civil and criminal penalties for persons \nviolating those laws. As a result of that agreement, the PRC was \nremoved from the watch lists.\n  By 1993, however, it was clear that the PRC was not living up to the \n1992 MOU and the country was placed back on the priority qatch list. \nThe amount of factories known to be producing pirated goods had risen \nfrom single digits to 29. These companies were exporting pirated goods \nin alarmingly increasing numbers; production of CD's alone ran to 75 \nmillion while China's internal market could absorb only 5 million. \nMoreover, enforcement was almost nonexistent. The National Copyright \nAdministration Office, located in less than half of China's provinces, \nhad few qualified employees and no real authority to prosecute \noffenders. Compounding the problem, several of the factories were known \nto have financial connections to local and national political figures. \nIn addition, several others were actually partially or wholly \nGovernment- or PLA-owned.\n  On June 30, 1994, the USTR initiated another Special 301 \ninvestigation of the PRC. On December 31, that office issued a proposed \ndetermination that the PRC's IPR enforcement practices were \nunreasonable and burdened or restricted United States commerce. At the \nsame time, the USTR issued a proposed list of Chinese goods to which \ntariffs of 100 percent would be attached as a retaliatory measure; the \nlist included approximately $2.8 billion of goods. The goods chosen \ncomprised 35 product categories of high-growth Chinese exports. Special \ncare was exercised to include items in which the Chinese Government had \na substantial involvement in producing, and to minimize any impact on \nUnited States consumers by picking articles readily available from \nother foreign or domestic sources.\n  The investigation period was then extended to February 4, 1995 to \nfacilitate continuing negotiations. On that date, though, having come \nto no resolution with the Chinese, the USTR ordered the imposition of \nthe proposed tariffs effective February 26. Their intent was to allow \ngoods that were currently in transit between the two countries to \narrive before the tariffs were finally imposed. It also gave both sides \nmore time to negotiate. Had the tariff action taken affect, it would \nhave been the largest retaliation ever taken by the U.S. Government. At \nthe same time, the Chinese announced that they would respond with \nretaliatory 100 percent tariff sanctions on a long list of United \nStates exports.\n  In the second week of February, the Chinese announced their \nwillingness to resume negotiations. Then-Deputy USTR Barshefsky \naccepted the invitation of Wu Yi, the PRC's Minister of Foreign Trade \nand Economic Cooperation, to come to China on February 20. In the \nmeantime, on February 15, the Chinese began a crackdown on the \npirating. Authorities raided and closed seven of the factories, \nincluding two of the most notorious: the Shenfei factory in Shenzhen \nand the Dragon Arts Sound Co. in Zhuhai. The two sides finally reached \nan eleventh-hour accord on February 26, 1995, thereby narrowly averting \nthe trade war.\n\n  The agreement signed in Beijing had three principle goals: to take \nimmediate steps to stem piracy of IPR material, to make long-term \nchanges to ensure effective enforcement of IPR in the future, and to \nprovide United States IPR holders with greater access to the Chinese \nmarket. As for the first goal, Beijing pledged to implement a 6-month \nSpecial Enforcement Period beginning March 1 during which time the \nGovernment would increase resources to target the 29 CD and laser disc \nfactories known to be engaging in pirated production, and confiscate \nand destroy illegally produced output and the machinery used to produce \nit. In addition, Beijing proposed to tighten its customs practices to \nstem the exportation of illegal products.\n  As for long-term changes, the Chinese Government pledged to ensure \nthat Government ministries cease using pirated software. Furthermore, \nthe Government pledged to establish an effective IPR enforcement \nstructure consisting of IPR conference working groups at the central, \nprovincial, and local level to coordinate enforcement efforts, and to \nensure that the laws are strictly enforced. Similarly, the PRC stated \nit would remodel its customs enforcement system after that of the \nUnited States. Lastly, China would create a title verification system, \nand would ensure that United States copyright holders have access to \neffective and meaningful judicial relief in cases of infringements.\n\n[[Page S4674]]\n\n  Finally, the PRC pledged to enhance access to its markets for United \nStates right holders. It agreed it would place no quotas on the \nimportation of U.S. audio-visual products, and would allow U.S. record \ncompanies--subject to certain censorship concerns--to market their \nentire catalog. United States companies were also to be permitted to \nenter into joint ventures for the production and reproduction of their \nproducts in the PRC.\n  On November 29, 1995, the subcommittee held a follow-up hearing to \nexamine the on-going implementation of the agreement and China's \ncompliance therewith. Since the signing of the agreement, several \nindustry associations had complained that the agreement was not being \nfully implemented in the PRC and that the situation had degenerated to \nthe pre-agreement state of affairs. According to the industry, many of \nthe pirating factories that had been closed down in February 1995 had \nreopened and were doing business as usual. In addition, the Chinese \nGovernment had let pass several of the deadlines for action on its part \nas specified in the agreement.\n  The subcommittee heard from the USTR and representatives of the IPR \nindustry (computer software, film, and recording industry). Then-Deputy \nUSTR Barshefsky testified that implementation had been ``mixed.'' On \nthe positive side, she noted that:\n\n       . . . the system is becoming more transparent--recently all \n     of China's IPR laws, regulations, and administrative guidance \n     were published, and public knowledge and understanding of IPR \n     laws and regulations is much better than it was;\n       [p]iracy at the retail level has been markedly reduced in \n     many major Chinese cities, particularly along the booming \n     southeast coast where U.S. losses have been the largest. \n     According to Chinese [g]overnment statistics, since signature \n     of the agreement, Chinese enforcement officials have launched \n     3,200 raids, seized and destroyed as many as 2 million \n     pirated CDs and LDs, 700,000 pirated videos, and 400,000 \n     pirated books; and\n       [i]n addition, China has made many of the structural \n     changes mandated by the agreement. China has set up \n     ministerial task forces in virtually all provincial capitals \n     and many major cities, 30 in all. It has set up high-level, \n     tough enforcement task forces in at least 18 provinces and \n     major municipalities. . . . China has now established IPR \n     courts in Beijing, Guangzhou, Shenzhen and other major \n     centers of piracy, and has begun an active program to train \n     Chinese judges in the enforcement of IPR laws.\n\n  However, having noted these positive signs, she continued:\n\n       Despite these steps, China's overall implementation of the \n     agreement falls far short of the requirements of the \n     agreement. Despite improved enforcement efforts, U.S. \n     industries still estimate that they lost $866 million as a \n     result of China's piracy in 1995.\n\n  She then listed several of the more notable problems:\n\n       Overall, while China has taken steps to clean up retail \n     markets, it has done little effectively so far to attack the \n     heart of the problem--continuing, massive production, \n     distribution, and export of pirated products. In particular, \n     we remain deeply concerned that China has not honored its \n     commitments to clean up production of pirated CDs in more \n     than 29 factories throughout [southeast] China. Under the \n     agreement, China was to have completed investigations of all \n     factories by July 1, 1995, and to have taken measures to \n     discipline, fine, or punish factories that violate Chinese \n     laws and regulations. To our great dismay, China has instead \n     reregistered--that is, given a clean bill of health to--all \n     but one of the CD factories. Factories . . . have shifted \n     their focus from . . . music CDs to higher value-added CD-\n     ROMs. The seizure of exports of pirated CD-ROMs . . . in \n     particular have risen by one hundred percent. . .. The \n     potential economic damage to the US software industry is \n     enormous. . . .\n       A single CD-ROM produced in China and acquired in Hong Kong \n     by the Business Software Alliance recently contained Lotus' \n     Supersuite (retails for $3,300), Autodsk's AutoCad (retails \n     for $4,250), and Novell's New Ware (retails for $2,485) along \n     with 100 other computer programs. The disk sold in Hong \n     Kong's notorious Golden Shopping Arcade for $6.75.\n\n  She went on to note that Chinese compliance in the printing of SID \ncodes had not been effectively implemented, China's Customs Service had \nnot yet aggressively pursued infringers, and Chinese promises to open \nmarket access to United States firms were not being kept. Industry \nspokesmen expressed similar views, although they were markedly less \nenthused about those areas in which Ms. Barshefsky claimed China had \ncooperated.\n  At a joint Senate-House hearing just this last March, we learned that \nthe situation has been reported to have remained largely the same. A \nreview of many of the major provisions of the agreement show why the \nUSTR is so concerned. For example, the agreement calls for the Chinese \nto investigate all CD production lines to ensure that titles being \nproduced there are legitimate. While the Chinese have assigned \ninvestigators to some factories to ensure title verification procedures \nare being followed and SID codes--a way to identify what factory a \nparticular CD came from--are being used. Yet according to the USTR, SID \ncodes are still not generally utilized and title verifications are \nbeing almost uniformly ignored.\n  In addition, the agreement calls for the revocation of business \npermits for factories involved in continuing illegal production. Yet of \nthe some 37 plants known to be operating illegally, only from 4 to 7--\ndepending on your source--have been closed. This leaves roughly 30 \nplants in operation with an annual production capability of from 150 to \n200,000,000 units. Given that the PRC's domestic market demand for \nlegitimate products is only around 7,000,000 units, Mr. President, you \ncan see that leaves quite a large gap.\n  The agreement requires the Chinese Government to establish a \ncopyright verification system that would prevent the manufacture and \nexport of CD's without being cleared by the Chinese Government and \nrepresentatives of affected copyright owners. While such a system has \nbeen formally established on paper, in practice U.S. copyright holders \nhave received only 5 requests for title verification in the past 18 \nmonths--yet experts estimate that over 60 million illicit CD's have \nbeen produced since the February agreement.\n\n  The agreement called for the abolition of quotas and other \nrestrictions on the importation into the People's Republic of China of \naudio products. However, there has been no change in that system. \nChinese officials alternately by denying the existence of a quota \nsystem or suggesting that now is not the time to amend such a system. \nSimilarly, the agreement called for permitting US companies to enter \ninto joint ventures for the production and reproduction of audio \nproducts. The Chinese side now claims that--contrary to the \nunderstanding of United States copyright holders in 1995--this \nprovision means that they may participate in joint ventures for \nmanufacturing products and not to original production.\n  In response to the allegations from the USTR and industry Zhang \nYuejiao, Director General of the Treaty and Law Department of the \nMinistry of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation [MOFTEC], recently \ntold China Daily:\n\n       Some overseas people have criticized China for not living \n     up to its promises on [IPR] protection. Such attacks are \n     totally groundless.\n\n  A lengthier statement from Chen Jian, a spokesman at the Chinese \nForeign Ministry, appeared in a recent edition of Beijing Review:\n\n       Protecting intellectual property rights is one of China's \n     basic state policies. Since adopting the reform and opening \n     policies, China has made tremendous efforts in the areas of \n     legislation, jurisdiction and law enforcement concerning the \n     protection of intellectual property rights. China has also \n     instituted a legal system for [IPR]. Over the past year, \n     China has adopted a series of measures to intensify law \n     enforcement activities, including a major crackdown on \n     piracy. We have achieved marked results in investigating and \n     regulating the audio-visual and publishing markets, as well \n     as in investigating and handling cases involving violations \n     of [IPR] by factories and individuals. Any criticism of China \n     for inadequately combatting piracy is groundless.\n       I should point out that IPR violations are an international \n     phenomenon existing in many countries, including the United \n     States. We are willing to exchange experiences and enhance \n     cooperation with other countries concerning IPR protection, \n     the United States included. Frequent threats of sanctions \n     will not only harm bilateral cooperation in IPR protection, \n     but also Sino-US economic and trade ties. We are opposed to \n     such practices.\n\n  A more recent trend in Chinese statements on the issue has sort of \ntaken the tone that ``the best defense is a good offense.'' In the past \nfew months, the Chinese official media have engaged in a media blitz to \ncounter assertions that the PRC is falling short of their obligations; \nthe cover of the April 22 Beijing Review carries a picture of the \ndeputy mayor of Chengdu, Wu Pingguo, holding up a pirated copy of\n\n[[Page S4675]]\n\n``Windows '95'' under the heading ``No Piracy.'' The Chinese Government \nhas begun to answer allegations of its failures with countercharges \nthat the United States has failed to live up to portions of the \nagreement by failing to provide promised technical and financial \nassistance. In one of my meetings during my trip to the People's \nRepublic of China over the April recess, one of the officials with whom \nI met even went so far as to say to me that while China was actually \nliving up to its side of the agreement 100 percent, American companies \nwere now engaged in wholesale piracy of Chinese IPR in the United \nStates.\n  Now, Mr. President, I will be the first to acknowledge that, as the \nUSTR has pointed out, the Chinese have made significant strides in \nimplementing some portions of the agreement. Fifteen years ago the \nconcept of intellectual property was a foreign one to the Chinese. In a \nConfucian-based system, knowledge was felt to belong to everyone; the \nChinese even have a saying: ``You cannot steal a book.'' This \ntradition, coupled with communism-based ideals that everyone works for \nthe benefit of his or her fellow citizens, are clearly antithetical to \nthe concept of IPR. Yet as a result of the agreement, the Chinese have \nmoved to put in place laws and enforcement systems to deal with the \nproblem. They have embarked on a campaign of educating citizens about \nIPR, and have conducted a series of raids of retail outlets selling \nillicit products. I applaud their efforts on this front.\n\n  But Mr. President, we have a clear agreement with the People's \nRepublic of China. And it is equally clear, regardless of their efforts \nand despite their protestations to the contrary, that the People's \nRepublic of China is not fully living up to its obligations under that \nagreement. I'm sorry, but they are not. They say they are, but to \nparaphrase a saying of which Beijing is inordinately fond of \ncastigating us with, ``Actions speak louder than words.'' The main \nproblem is that while it is commendable that the government is going \nafter retailers, it continues to overlook the source of the products. \nThe excuse often heard is that China is a big country and the central \ngovernment cannot know at all times which factories are producing \nillegal goods and where they are. Well, if those factories were \nproducing pamphlets calling for the overthrow of the Communist \ngovernment in Beijing, you could be quite sure that they would be shut \ndown in a heartbeat. Moreover, it is not as though the factories \ninvolved in CD and related IPR production in China are mysterious \nhidden entities, Mr. President; even I have a list of them:\n\n       Zhuhai Hua Sheng Magnetic Tape Factory, Dakengmei, Wanzai, \n     Zhuhai;\n       Zhuhai GLM Laser Master Matrix Mfg.

And with that \nknowledge, it went ahead and legally committed itself to a \ncomprehensive course of action--not to fulfill the terms partially, or \nas it felt like it, or selectively, but a comprehensive plan. The \nForeign Ministry has stated that ``protection of IPR is a highly \ncomplex undertaking that cannot be completely resolved in a short \ntime.'' Well, Mr. President, if such is the case, then the People's \nRepublic of China [PRC] shouldn't have agreed to do so.\n  I am a firm believer that once a country signs an agreement it should \nadhere to it. Apparently, in theory, so are the Chinese; they \nconstantly berate us, and other countries, accusing us of failing to \nlive up to our agreements. Yet it is abundantly clear that the Chinese \nside has not fully lived up to the agreement.\n  Now, Mr. President, that leaves us, as the aggrieved party, with few \noptions. First, we could ignore their breach and continue to allow the \nPRC to flout the agreement. This would, though, have unfortunate \nrepercussions. It would demonstrate to the PRC, indeed to all of Asia, \nthat there is no price to pay for ignoring or otherwise failing to \nimplement agreements with the United States. I am quite sure that that \nis not the kind of message we want to be sending.\n  Another choice would be to work quietly with the Chinese to resolve \nthose disagreements which remain outstanding to avoid having to rely on \nother more public avenues to getting them to comply. Well, Mr. \nPresident, we have tried that route with no success. Assistant USTR Lee \nSands has been to China several times since last year to try to work \nthings out; Acting-USTR Barshefsky has been to Beijing several times \nwith the same goal. Jason Berman, chairman and CEO of the Recording \nIndustry Association of America, has been to China; representatives of \nthe movie and computer software industries have been to China--all to \nno avail.\n  So, Mr. President, we find ourselves faced with the only remaining \nway to impress upon the Chinese the seriousness of the problem, our \ndisappointment at their failure to adhere to the agreement, and the \nextent of the monetary loss we suffer: economic sanctions. This is not \na course of action which I relish, Mr. President; unilateral sanctions \nare rarely an effective instrument of foreign or trade policy. They \nhave unavoidable consequences for the domestic economy; besides \neffecting domestic industries which rely on imported goods from China, \nthey can also impact other businesses. To illustrate, the Chinese have \ncountered to suggestions of trade sanctions with a thinly-veiled threat \nto United States business interests in China:\n\n       Should the US side go ahead with taking sanctions against \n     China, US commercial interests would in the end be seriously \n     harmed and that would amount to the US imposing counter-\n     sanctions against itself.\n\n  We have seen this before. Last year when sanctions were pending the \nChinese awarded several contracts which were considered safely in the \npockets of United States corporations to European competitors; the \nsignal was clear. Premier Li Peng recently travelled to France where he \nsigned several significant trade deals--most notably with Airbus--\npointedly aimed at reminding us that we are not their only trade \nsource.\n  The Chinese are quick to say that we should not resort to the \nimposition of sanctions, that we should discuss the issue ``on the \nbasis of equality.'' Well, Mr. President, there is no equality in their \nversion of equality. Does equality exist when one party flouts an \nagreement to the detriment of the other? I think not.\n\n[[Page S4676]]\n\n  So, Mr. President, I reluctantly, yet fully, support the USTR on this \nissue. I urge the President to follow the USTR's recommendations, and \nto do so soon. I realize that there are some in the administration who \nare hesitant to press this issue for fear of rocking the boat--the same \nreason for the administration's emasculated response to the Chinese \nsales of ring magnets and the like to Pakistan--but failure to act will \nonly embolden the Chinese and will only serve to add fuel to the fire \nof what already promises to be a raucous MFN debate.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/05/03/senate-section/article/S4672-5", "month": "05", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "03", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4676]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. McCathran, one of his secretaries.\n\n\n                      executive messages referred\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/05/03/senate-section/article/S4676-1", "month": "05", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "03", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4676]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              INTRODUCTION OF BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS\n\n  The following bills and joint resolutions were introduced, read the \nfirst and second time by unanimous consent, and referred as indicated:\n\n           By Mr. STEVENS:\n       S. 1728.

Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation at the \nrequest of the Department of Defense [DOD] to amend the act to prevent \npollution from ships to bring Navy operations in line with the \nInternational Convention for the Prevention of Pollution by Ships--the \nMARPOL Convention.\n  I ask for unanimous consent that the following summary of the bill \nand background information provided by the DOD be printed in the \nRecord.\n  I ask for unanimous consent that the bill be printed in full in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1728\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. NAVY COMPLIANCE WITH SHIPBOARD SOLID WASTE CONTROL \n                   REQUIREMENTS.\n\n       Section 3(c) of the Act to Prevent Pollution from Ships (33 \n     U.S.C. 1902(c)) is amended to read as follows:\n       ``(c) Discharges in Special Areas.--\n       ``(1) Not later than December 31, 2000, all surface ships \n     owned or operated by the Department of the Navy, and not \n     later than December 31, 2008, all submersibles owned or \n     operated by the Department of the Navy, shall comply with the \n     special area requirements of Regulation 5 of Annex V to the \n     Convention, except as provided in paragraphs (2) and (3) of \n     this subsection.\n       ``(2) Vessels owned or operated by the Department of the \n     Navy for which the Secretary of the Navy determines that, due \n     to a uniquely military design, construction, manning or \n     operating requirements, full compliance with paragraph (1) \n     would not be technologically feasible, or would impair the \n     vessel's operations or operational capability, are authorized \n     to discharge non-plastic and non-floating garbage consisting \n     of--\n       ``(A) a slurry of seawater, paper, cardboard and food \n     waste, provided such slurry is discharged not less than three \n     nautical miles from the nearest land and is capable of \n     passing through a screen with openings of no greater than 12 \n     millimeters; and\n       ``(B) metal and glass garbage that has been shredded and \n     bagged to ensure negative buoyancy and is discharged not less \n     than twelve nautical miles from the nearest land.\n       ``(3) Not later than December 31, 2000, the Secretary of \n     the Navy shall publish in the Federal Register--\n       ``(A) a list of those vessels planned to be decommissioned \n     between January 1, 2001, and December 31, 2005; and\n       ``(B) standards to ensure, so far as reasonable and \n     practicable, without impairing the operations or operational \n     capabilities of such vessels, that such vessels act in a \n     manner that is consistent with the special area requirements \n     of Regulation 5 of Annex V.\n       ``(4) Notwithstanding paragraphs (2) and (3) of this \n     section, it shall be the goal of the Department of the Navy \n     to achieve eventual full compliance with Annex V as part of \n     the Department's ongoing development of environmentally sound \n     ships.''.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n                            Summary of Bill\n\n       The purpose of this bill is to amend section 1902(c) of the \n     Act to Prevent the Pollution from Ships (33 U.S.C. 1901 et \n     seq.).\n       The MARPOL Convention requires party states to adopt \n     measures requiring their warships to comply with garbage \n     discharge restrictions to the extent reasonable and \n     practicable. The Act to Prevent Pollution from Ships, \n     however, established a no-discharge requirement (except food \n     waste) in special areas for all public vessels. The proposed \n     bill would allow U.S. Navy surface warships to discharge \n     pulped and shredded non-hazardous, non-plastic, non-solid \n     floating waste in special areas, consistent with the MARPOL \n     Convention, while reaffirming the U.S. commitment to \n     achieving eventual full compliance by all public vessels.\n       Paragraphs (2), (3), and (4) of section 1902(c) are \n     eliminated. These paragraphs pertain to the one-time \n     submission to Congress by the Secretary of the Navy of a plan \n     for special area compliance by Navy Ships. The plan will have \n     been submitted by November 1996, after which time the \n     statutory language requiring such plan will be surplusage.\n       Paragraph (1) of section 1902(c) is amended to reiterate \n     the special area compliance deadlines of the current \n     paragraph (December 31, 2000 for surface ships; December 31, \n     2008 for submersibles), but to allow exceptions as delineated \n     in new paragraphs (c)(2) and (c)(3).\n       For ships that the Secretary of the Navy determines that, \n     due to the uniquely military characteristics, compliance \n     would not be technologically feasible, or would impair the \n     vessel's operations or operational capability, new paragraph \n     (c)(2) authorizes the discharge within in-effect MARPOL Annex \n     V special areas of non-hazardous, non-plastic, non-floating \n     garbage consisting of either:\n       a. A slurry of seawater, paper, cardboard and food waste \n     that is capable of passing through a screen with openings of \n     12 millimeters (about \\1/2\\ inch); or\n       b. Metal and glass garbage that has been shredded and \n     bagged to ensure negative buoyancy.\n       Discharges of pulped biodegradable material (paper and \n     cardboard) would be authorized no closer than three nautical \n     miles from shore and discharges of shredded non-biodegradable \n     material (glass/metal) would be authorized no closer than 12 \n     nautical miles from shore.\n       New Section (c)(3)(b) ensures that Navy vessels which are \n     to be decommissioned within 5 years, and for which \n     installation of solid waste processing equipment would \n     therefore not be cost effective, will comply with special \n     areas requirements of Annex V as far as is reasonable and \n     practicable, without impairing the operations or \n     operational capabilities.\n       New Section (c)(4) sets a goal for the Department of the \n     Navy to achieve eventual full compliance with Annex V as part \n     of the Department's ongoing development of environmentally \n     sound ships.\n\n\n                               background\n\n       The FY94 DoD Authorization Act required the Secretary of \n     the Navy to submit to Congress by November 1996 a plan for \n     compliance by Department of Navy ships with the special area \n     provisions of the MARPOL Convention. Accordingly, the Under \n     Secretary of the Navy formed an executive steering committee \n     to oversee development of the plan. The Navy has conducted a \n     thorough analysis of technologies and management practices \n     for special area compliance. The major findings include the \n     following:\n       a. Full compliance with U.S. law could be achieved through \n     installation of incinerators, at a fleet-wide cost of about \n     $1.2 billion. Incinerator installation would significantly \n     degrade operations due to displacement of existing ship \n     systems and addition of significant weight. Incineration may \n     be regulated in the future by a new annex to MARPOL thus \n     adding uncertainty to acceptability of shipboard \n     incineration.\n       b. Full compliance with U.S. law could be achieved through \n     garbage compaction and retrograde for shore disposal, at a \n     fleet-wide cost of over $1.1 billion. Retention and \n     retrograde presents a host of operational and habitability \n     problems. Associated costs include the modification of ships \n     to accommodate both waste processing (compaction) and storage \n     space, additional Combat Logistics Force ships for garbage \n     collection, increased time and maintenance for underway \n     replenishment/garbage off-loads, and disposal costs in \n     foreign ports. Another consideration is the uncertain fate of \n     garbage in foreign ports and limited landfill space in many \n     countries.\n       c. The National Academy of Science completed a shipboard \n     waste technology assessment for the Navy. Other possible \n     technologies, such as plasma arc pyrolysis and super critical \n     water oxidation, are not yet developed sufficiently for \n     shipboard application.\n       d. Full compliance with MARPOL, but not existing U.S. law, \n     could be achieved through use of pulpers and shredders in \n     special areas,\n\n[[Page S4677]]\n\n     at a fleet-wide cost of about $300 million. Installation of \n     pulpers and shredders would actually enhance operational \n     capability, by enabling discharge of pulped garbage from \n     inside the ship during heavy weather and flight operations, \n     when unprocessed garbage discharges are currently prohibited. \n     Use of pulpers and shredders worldwide (not just in special \n     areas) would virtually eliminate the possibility of shipboard \n     waste wash-up on beaches and shorelines. Fate and effects \n     studies commissioned by the Navy with the collaboration of \n     Scripps Institute, NOAA, and the University of Georgia \n     indicate that pulper and shredder discharges, in the types \n     and amounts predicted from Navy vessels, would not result in \n     significant impacts to the marine environment. An Environment \n     Impact Statement is also being completed. In accordance with \n     CEQ regulations, a Legislative EIS will be available within \n     30 days of the legislative proposal.\n       Accordingly, the Navy has identified the use of pulpers and \n     shredders as the preferred method for special area shipboard \n     waste management for its larger, ocean-going vessels. \n     Smaller, coastal vessels would retain and retrograde waste, \n     since at-sea time is limited. The pulper-shredder approach is \n     environmentally benign and entirely consistent with U.S. \n     obligations under international law. This amendment to the \n     Act to Prevent Pollution from Ships would authorize the use \n     of the pulper-shredder approach for solid waste discharges \n     under U.S. law. This approach would reduce the need for shore \n     based reception facilities and would enable the five \n     designated but not in-effect special areas to more quickly \n     come into effect.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/05/03/senate-section/article/S4676-3", "month": "05", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "03", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4677]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL COSPONSORS\n\n\n                                 S. 684\n\n  At the request of Mr. Hatfield, the name of the Senator from Ohio \n[Mr. DeWine] was added as a cosponsor of S. 684, a bill to amend the \nPublic Health Service Act to provide for programs of research regarding \nParkinson's disease, and for other purposes.\n\n\n                                 S. 953\n\n  At the request of Mr. Chafee, the names of the Senator from Wisconsin \n[Mr. Kohl], the Senator from Utah [Mr. Bennett], the Senator from \nAlaska [Mr. Murkowski], and the Senator from Montana [Mr. Burns] were \nadded as cosponsors of S. 953, a bill to require the Secretary of the \nTreasury to mint coins in commemoration of black revolutionary war \npatriots.\n\n\n                                S. 1150\n\n  At the request of Mr. Kennedy, his name was added as a cosponsor of \nS. 1150, a bill to require the Secretary of the Treasury to mint coins \nin commemoration of the 50th anniversary of the Marshall plan and \nGeorge Catlett Marshall.\n\n\n                                S. 1437\n\n  At the request of Mr. Thurmond, the name of the Senator from \nLouisiana [Mr. Johnston] was added as a cosponsor of S. 1437, a bill to \nprovide for an increase in funding for the conduct and support of \ndiabetes-related research by the National Institutes of Health.\n\n\n                                S. 1534\n\n  At the request of Mr. Hatfield, the name of the Senator from Idaho \n[Mr. Craig] was added as a cosponsor of S. 1534, a bill to amend the \nPublic Health Service Act to provide additional support for and to \nexpand clinical research programs, and for other purposes.\n\n\n                    Senate Concurrent Resolution 42\n\n  At the request of Mrs. Kassebaum, the name of the Senator from North \nDakota [Mr. Dorgan] was added as a cosponsor of Senate Concurrent \nResolution 42, a concurrent resolution concerning the emancipation of \nthe Iranian Baha'i community.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/05/03/senate-section/article/S4677-1", "month": "05", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "03", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4677-S4678]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED\n\n                                 ______\n\n\n THE WHITE HOUSE TRAVEL OFFICE EXPENSES AND FEES REIMBURSEMENT ACT OF \n                                  1996\n\n                                 ______\n\n\n                        DOLE AMENDMENT NO. 3952\n\n  Mr. DOLE proposed an amendment to the bill (H.R. 2937) for the \nreimbursement of legal expenses and related fees incurred by former \nemployees of the White House Travel Office with respect to the \ntermination of their employment in that Office on May 19, 1993; as \nfollows:\n\n       Strike all after the enacting clause and insert in lieu \n     thereof the following:\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, next week Secretary Christopher \nwill attend the Annual Bi-National Commission\n\n[[Page S4679]]\n\nmeeting in Mexico City. Secretary Christopher should use this meeting \nto convey the United States' deep concern over the pervasive and \nconsistent flow of narcotics from Mexico into the United States. The \nadministration must insist that the Mexican Government make real and \nsubstantial efforts to stop the flow of illegal drugs into our country.\n  Yesterday, the Administrator of the DEA, Thomas Constantine and \nAttorney General Janet Reno announced the successful completion of law-\nenforcement operation Zorro II which resulted in the arrest of members \nof a major Mexican drug cartel. In Zorro II, 130 individuals were \narrested for their involvement in a cocaine smuggling and distribution \nnetwork that had been operating, and flourishing, in the United States. \nThis successful law enforcement initiative is a major victory in the \nwar against the drugs and narcotics-related crimes which are ravaging \nour cities.\n  Mr. President, there are daily news reports of rampant corruption and \nabuse within the Mexican Government involving members of its law \nenforcement. I will ask to have printed in the Record an article from \nlast Sunday's Washington Post, entitled ``The Drug Fiefdom of Northern \nMexico.'' According to this April 28 article, ``The four main Mexican \ndrug mafias--all headquartered along the 2,000 mile U.S.-Mexico \nborder--now supply more than 70% of the cocaine and half of all the \nmarijuana sold in the U.S. The drugs funnel as much as $30 billion a \nyear in illegal proceeds back into Mexico--more than the country's top \ntwo legitimate exports combined.''\n  Maybe the administration and the Mexican Government are finally \nwilling to acknowledge the severity and impact of the drug problem. \nAccording to other news reports, Mexican narcotics organizations rely \non protection from members of the government, police, and judiciary for \ntheir continued success and growth. These drug syndicates then turn to \nthe Mexican banks and exchange houses to launder their dirty money. \nThis incredible expansion of the Mexican narcotics trade and the \nalleged corruption of Mexican Government officials and business leaders \nis unprecedented. Unfortunately, Mexico's drug problems are not \nconfined to the south side of our shared border.\n  Mr. President, I was encouraged to learn that the Mexican Government \nfinally took a long-overdue first step with its enactment earlier this \nweek of an anti-money-laundering bill, but this is only the first step. \nThe true test will be whether, and how, the law is actually enforced. \nOne thing is certain, the defensiveness and reluctance of Mexican \nofficials to acknowledge the severity of the money laundering problem \nis very disturbing. I am in full support of the recent, and valid, \nstatements made by Thomas Constantine, Administrator for the U.S. Drug \nEnforcement Agency regarding this money laundering epidemic. Mr. \nConstantine's leadership in this war on drugs is exemplified by \nOperation Zorro II's success.\n  Mr. President, I sincerely hope that strong and decisive action \nagainst Mexican drug traffickers is a fundamental part of the \nadministration's recently released 1996 National Drug Control Strategy. \nOn behalf of the administration, and with the support of this Senator, \nSecretary Christopher should forcefully urge the Mexican Government to \ncooperate with United States requests for extraditions of Mexican \nnarcotics traffickers and other criminals who have committed heinous \nacts of violence in the United States. It is a fact that to date, \nMexico still has not extradited a single Mexican national convicted of \ndrug trafficking in the United States.\n  At the Banking Committee's recent hearing, perhaps the most \ncompelling, and disturbing testimony came from T. J. Bonner, a border \npatrol agent. Mr. Bonner testified about his first hand views of life \non the firing lines in this war on drugs. He also provided a disturbing \naccount of the January 1996 killing of Border Patrol Agent Jefferson \nBarr. Mr. Barr was shot and killed while intercepting a group of \nMexican drug smugglers in Eagle Pass, TX. One of Mr. Barr's murderers \nwas identified and located by the FBI in a hospital in Mexico. This \nkiller was charged with murder and the United States is seeking his \nextradition. But the Government of Mexico has failed to honor this \nrequest. This is an outrage and a tragedy. The United States \nadministration must get tough with the Mexican Government and demand \ntheir full cooperation in dealing with these criminals.\n  Mr. President, the flood of narcotics being sent from Mexico to the \nUnited States is tearing apart the social fabric of our country. \nSenator Feinstein and I recently introduced a bill, S. 1547, which \nwould prevent the administration from wasting more taxpayer dollars on \nthe Mexican bailout unless concerted measures are taken to stop the \nmassive flow of narcotics from Mexico into the United States. I urge my \ncolleagues to support this bill.\n  Mr. President, the administration must continue to open their eyes to \nthese problems. We cannot pretend as if they do not exist and simply \nhope they will disappear. As a result of the administration's past \nneglect and unwillingness to confront the drug problem, the narcotics \ncrisis in this country has escalated in the last 3 years. The \nadministration's charade in declaring Mexico as ``fully cooperative'' \nunder the Foreign Assistance Act must end. If the Mexican Government \nwants to pretend there are no problems and feign indignation when \nconfronted with these issues, then they should not expect United States \nfinancial support in any form. The future of our country and our \nchildren is at stake.\n  Mr. President, Secretary Christopher should take a strong antidrug \nmessage to Mexico. We must employ every weapon in our arsenal in this \nwar on drugs--diplomatic, financial, enforcement, and education. Every \nhigh-level U.S. official must be recruited in our battle with the drug \nepidemic waging war on this country.\n  I ask that the Washington Post article, to which I earlier referred, \nbe printed in the Record.\n  The article follows:\n\n               [From the Washington Post, Apr. 28, 1996]\n\n                  The Drug Fiefdom of Northern Mexico\n\n                (By Molly Moore and John Ward Anderson)\n\n       Nueva Casas Grandes, Mexico.--The only sign of prosperity \n     in this bleak desert city, 75 miles south of El Paso, is a \n     gigantic, fake medieval castle rising like a strange mirage \n     above cactus and scrub brush, abandoned houses and closed \n     shops.\n       Camelot, as the ostentatious, slate-blue disco and concert \n     hall is known, stands as a stark reminder of how the culture \n     of narcotics trafficking can ravage cities as well as people. \n     Bountiful narco-dollars--brought in by drug lords who used \n     clandestine airstrips outside of town for cocaine shipments \n     to the United States--built the castle and fueled an economic \n     boom in the city.\n       Then, as quickly as the narco-dollars poured in, they \n     suddenly evaporated when the new boss of Mexico's most \n     powerful drug mafia started using Boeing 727 cargo planes to \n     bypass Nueva Casas Grandes and similar cities, transforming \n     their narco booms into recessionary busts.\n       ``The drug dealers brought shoes in by the boxes, but now \n     the money is not coming this way,'' complained Ricardo \n     Contreras, 24, who shines shoes in the town square.\n       His is not the only ruined city along the U.S.-Mexican \n     border. The rise and demise of Nueva Casas Grandes reflects \n     how drug trafficking has reshaped the economic, social and \n     political landscape of northern Mexico in the last five \n     years. Shifting dynamics in the international drug trade, as \n     well as growing pressure on traffickers in Colombia, where \n     cocaine largely is produced, have turned this region known \n     for its booming manufacturing industry, burgeoning consumer \n     class and progressive politics into a land of laundered drug \n     money, riddled with corruption and violence.\n       Northern Mexico's slide toward becoming a new Latin fiefdom \n     for the movement of drugs is a major problem for the United \n     States, long accustomed to viewing the region as a model of \n     development. The four main Mexican drug mafias--all \n     headquartered along the 2,000-mile U.S.-Mexico border--now \n     supply more than 70 percent of the cocaine and half of all \n     the marijuana sold in the United States, in addition to large \n     quantities of heroin and methamphetamine. The drugs funnel as \n     much as $30 billion a year in illegal proceeds back into \n     Mexico--more than the country's top two legitimate exports \n     combined.\n       For a decade, northern Mexico has been the embodiment of \n     American hopes about where its southern neighbor was going. \n     It has been the region where private enterprise and export-\n     oriented manufacturing flourishes, where peasants move up \n     from poverty, where the North American Free Trade Agreement \n     is gospel, and where pluralism and the beginnings of real \n     democracy in Mexico have taken root. Now it is threatening to \n     become an enormous menace--an empire of drug lords who \n     smuggle cocaine and weapons across the border, corrupt \n     officials on both sides of the border and terrorize border \n     cities with assassinations.\n       Here, where the money first arrives from the United States \n     in car trunks, by wire\n\n[[Page S4680]]\n\n     transfers and--in recent months--through huge third-party \n     check-buying networks, the influence of billions of narco-\n     dollars has become embedded in the culture of the frontier, \n     transcending the usual symbols of drug trafficking: the \n     ostentatious pink mansions of the newly wealthy, the crude \n     graffiti of the multiplying street gangs in border slums, the \n     frequent shootouts between feuding drug factions and the wars \n     between corrupt police units.\n       The money is financing the businesses where residents eat, \n     play, work, shop and invest. It is altering the lives and \n     health of their children and families, leading to \n     skyrocketing homicide and overdose rates. It is greasing the \n     governments that run the cities, states and nation.\n       ``It is part of everyday life in northern Mexico,'' said \n     Luis Astorga, a sociologist who has written extensively about \n     the social and cultural impact of the drug trade in his \n     native frontier region. ``It cannot be separated from the \n     legitimate economy or the authorities in power.''\n       Northern Mexico has been a major smuggling route since \n     early in this century, when cattle rustler-turned-guerrilla \n     Pancho Villa stormed across the desert frontier fomenting the \n     revolutionary fervor of 1917. It is a vast territory of dry \n     lake beds ideal for landing cocaine-packed jets, scrub desert \n     perfect for eluding border guards, industrial areas with \n     numerous warehouses for stockpiling tons of illegal drugs and \n     border stations where customs officials check barely 5 \n     percent of the 87 million vehicles that cross each year.\n       The cities of northern Mexico have diverse economies, \n     developed from decades of legitimate cross-border trade and \n     tourism with their richer northern neighbor. The border was \n     crossed last year by about 232 million people, making it the \n     world's busiest international boundary.\n       It is Mexico's most prosperous and industrialized region, \n     stretching from Tijuana--the country's most visited tourist \n     destination--through dusty desert villages, past grimy Cuidad \n     Juarez on the border and eastward toward the high-rises and \n     belching industries of Monterrey, dubbed the Pittsburgh of \n     Mexico. Despite the country's deepest economic recession in \n     60 years, northern Mexico's border cities continue to boom, \n     adding jobs in a year of record unemployment nationally and \n     building new industries during a period of unprecedented \n     bankruptcies and collapsing businesses.\n       But now the underground economy built from decades of \n     smuggling contraband, people and drugs to the United States \n     has become so intertwined with the region's legitimate wealth \n     that the two are almost indistinguishable, according to \n     investigators. The constantly flowing river of people and \n     money--magnified by the North American Free Trade Agreement \n     among the United States, Mexico and Canada--is a perfect \n     disguise for moving drugs in a narco-dollars out of the \n     United States, investigators say.\n       One highly audible indication of how drug culture has \n     penetrated the north of Mexico is found on the radio \n     airwaves, where the most popular songs are ``narco-ballads'' \n     about daring trafficking escapades with drug lords as the \n     heroes and police as the bad guys. The songs belt out the \n     tales of mafia rivalries and hapless U.S. drug agents with \n     extraordinarily accurate details of the constantly changing \n     drug world. ``Mess with the mafia and pay with your hide,'' \n     one warns.\n       While the exact amount of narcotics money flowing back to \n     Mexico is impossible to calculate, Mexican Assistant Attorney \n     General Moises Moreno Hernandez, speaking at a conference \n     last August, estimated that $30 billion was returned to \n     Mexico in 1994. The U.S. Treasury's Financial Crime \n     Enforcement Network estimates it at $10 billion to $30 \n     billion.\n       Nowhere are the effects of the drug trade more evident than \n     in booming border cities such as Ciudad Juarez, a roiling \n     metropolis of 1.3 million that is joined by five bridges to \n     El Paso, Tex. Authorities say it is the home of Mexico's most \n     powerful drug cartel.\n       Despite the nationwide recession, Juarez--along with many \n     of its sister cities along the border--is growing, if not \n     prospering. Employment is up, glitzy new office buildings are \n     under construction, and its bars and restaurants are packed. \n     While much of the city's economic success is the result of \n     legitimate business, a strong industrial base and cross-\n     border tourism from El Paso, city residents from all walks of \n     life say drug money has become so entwined in their local \n     economy that above-board businesses and those financed by \n     narco-dollars are difficult to separate.\n       The influx of drug money has helped shape the city, from \n     seedy discos and bars that run along the underbelly of \n     downtown Juarez to ritzy country club estates clustered \n     around a green oasis of golf courses in newly developing \n     suburbs.\n       The Juarez Cartel and the many local organizations that are \n     its subcontractors for transporting the drugs have bought \n     heavily into trucking businesses and car dealerships for \n     their operations. One major trafficking family owns a \n     petroleum company and is said to use its tanker truckers for \n     smuggling drugs, according to U.S. and Mexican law \n     enforcement officials. And the boss of the Juarez cartel, \n     Amado Carrillo Fuentes, allegedly owns several small \n     airlines.\n       In Tijuana, the Arellano-Felix brothers--leaders of the \n     violent Tijuana Cartel--are suspected of using a local \n     racetrack to launder their drug money. Juan Garcia Abrego, \n     the recently arrested head of the Gulf Cartel, reportedly \n     owned more than a dozen used-car and automotive parts stores \n     along the south Texas-Mexican border.\n       But law enforcement officials and local business leaders \n     say it has become difficult to track the investments of the \n     cartels and their associates. ``They're getting much \n     smarter,'' said a Juarez businessman. ``You can't drive down \n     the street anymore and say that and that and that was built \n     by the drug lords. Now they're using middlemen to buy \n     buildings.''\n       For many residents, the map of northern Mexico is \n     determined not by highways and state lines but by the \n     frequently changing territories controlled by drug-\n     trafficking organizations. The areas shift each time a \n     kingpin is assassinated or jailed.\n       Today, two mafias dominate the region--the Juarez and the \n     Tijuana cartels--and two other powerful groups, the Sonora \n     and Gulf cartels, operate variously at odds or in concert \n     with them. The major trafficking organizations are known by \n     several names, but generally are associated with their areas \n     of geographic control. They, in turn, subcontract the \n     logistics of transporting their drugs among an estimated 250 \n     families and gangs that work specific smuggling routes across \n     the frontier.\n       The Juarez Cartel, headed by Carrillo, today is \n     undisputedly the most powerful mafia, controlling the central \n     trafficking corridor between Juarez and El Paso. In recent \n     months Carrillo also has begun expanding east into the \n     territory of the Gulf Cartel, which is in disarray after the \n     arrest earlier this year of its alleged kingpin, Garcia \n     Abrego.\n       Carrillo, who took over the Juarez Cartel after his rival \n     for the leadership was gunned down on a Cancun beach three \n     years ago, is considered the pioneer of the new breed of \n     shrewder, more corporate cartel bosses who shun the \n     limelight.\n       With many more billions of dollars at risk, Carrillo and \n     his competitors are seldom seen in the restaurants and discos \n     they have built across northern Mexico. They have not given \n     up their lavish lifestyles, but now they entertain in private \n     while threatening local newspaper editors to keep away their \n     photographers. Often traffickers invite well-known music \n     stars to sing for select guests inside well-guarded ranches \n     near their northern Mexico headquarters and lavish compounds \n     in more glamorous parts of the country, such as Guadalajara, \n     Acapulco and other resort areas.\n       But Carrillo and his counterparts are no less brutal than \n     those before them. Shootouts between rival groups often occur \n     along the border; in some major cities, drug assassinations \n     are nearly a daily occurrence. The victims' bodies are left \n     with the telltale mafia signatures: hands tied and a single \n     bullet in the head.\n       Last year, the largest cities along the border recorded \n     more than 1,000 slayings, more than half of them drug-related \n     and unsolved. In Tijuana, for example, there were 121 \n     homicides in the last six months, and officials say at least \n     half involved drugs.\n       Last year in Juarez, homicides were up 25 percent to 295, \n     of which police estimate 70 percent were drug-related. Two \n     years ago, the tortured bodies of the city's newly retired \n     police chief and two of his sons were found in the trunk of \n     their car, which had been parked on one of the busy bridges \n     connecting Juarez and El Paso. Family members said they \n     believed the three were murdered by drug lords who suspected \n     the 26-year veteran policeman of being an informant for U.S. \n     law enforcement officials.\n       City officials say much of the sharp rise in homicides and \n     other crimes in Juarez is a side effect of the Juarez \n     Cartel's practice of subcontracting its transportation and \n     distribution needs to numerous smaller organizations along \n     the border. Those groups in turn often hire local smuggling \n     families on street gang members to carry the drugs into the \n     United Sates in the trunks of cars, on the backs of mules in \n     more remote desert areas, or hidden in boxes of tennis shoes, \n     tomatoes or other legitimate commercial items hauled by 18-\n     wheel trucks.\n       As a result, hundreds of newly created ganps--put at 450 \n     today, up from 120 five years ago--are battling for control \n     of the street sale of drugs in Juarez. In many parts of \n     downtown Juarez, gangs with names such as Los Gatos (The \n     Cats) or El Puente Negro (The Black Bridge gang), the city's \n     most notorious, rule the night and mark their territory with \n     bold spray-painted graffiti.\n       With so much cocaine entering northern Mexico, an \n     increasing amount never leaves. The Mexican drug cartels \n     often take payment from their Colombian cocaine suppliers in \n     the form of drugs rather than cash--a portion of which they \n     sell locally. Juarez last year reported that drug ``shooting \n     galleries'' multiplied faster than police could track them.\n       So while Mexico's national leaders are fond of saying drugs \n     merely pass through Mexico en route to the world's largest \n     consumer market of illegal narcotics, the outspoken mayor of \n     Juarez, Ramon Galindo Noriega, says that is no longer the \n     case. Last year, 90 people died of overdoses--up from four or \n     five the previous year, according to the major.\n       According to court testimony in the United States and U.S. \n     and Mexican law enforcement officials, the cartels pay as \n     much as $500 million a year in protection money to Mexican \n     police, politicians and government officials--from the lowest \n     border guard to the highest reaches of the federal \n     government. Just this month, the governor of the\n\n[[Page S4681]]\n\n     border state of Nuevo Leon was forced to resign following \n     accusations of mismanagement and drug-related corruption.\n       In some respects, northern Mexico should have had the best \n     chance of any region of the nation to shake off decades of \n     political corruption and offer tough resistance to the rise \n     of the drug kingpins.\n       It was the first region of the country where members of the \n     conservative opposition National Action Party (PAN) broke the \n     stranglehold of the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party \n     (PRI), winning governorships, mayoralties and municipal seats \n     with promises of fighting entrenched corruption.\n       Instead, the drug cartels are more powerful than ever.\n       One of the first PAN governors in the north, Ernesto Ruffo \n     Appel, former governor of Baja California, said he found \n     drug-based corruption too institutionalized to clean up from \n     the governor's office.\n       ``The system doesn't work,'' said Ruffo, who works at the \n     national party level. ``Everybody's on the take. There's just \n     too much money.''\n       According to many law enforcement officials and political \n     specialists, the institutionalization of corruption is a key \n     milestone in northern Mexico's journey toward becoming a drug \n     fiefdom.\n       ``In the past, you had specific protection rackets that \n     were between particular people,'' said a U.S. law enforcement \n     official who monitors drug trafficking on the border. ``Now \n     you increasingly have protection [for the cartels] regardless \n     of who sits in a particular law enforcement job.''\n       At the low end, police, because of their poor pay, \n     traditionally have been thoroughly corrupted by drug cartels. \n     Police frequently act as bodyguards and assassins for the \n     kingpins, and raging gun battles among local, state and \n     federal police units--some in the pay of the cartels, the \n     others trying to arrest them--are commonplace.\n       Late one night a few weeks ago, a Wild West-style shootout \n     exploded on the streets of Juarez--police were fighting it \n     out with police.\n       Carloads of federal police surrounded city police \n     headquarters and within minutes shooting broke out, leaving \n     one federal officer dead on the bloodied pavement and several \n     city police wounded in what many officials described as an \n     outgrowth of simmering tensions between rival drug protection \n     rackets.\n       ``I know I have policemen who are paid by the drug \n     dealers,'' said Mayor Galindo. ``I pay 2,200 pesos [$297] a \n     month. A drug dealer can give $1,000 a week for protection. I \n     can't compete. When I listen to the politicians in Mexico \n     City talk about the drug struggle, they don't know what \n     they're talking about. Where can I hire police I can trust?''\n       A few months before the shootout, Juarez city police--\n     frustrated that their federal counterparts, charged with \n     enforcing drug laws, were taking no action to stop the \n     proliferation of drug shooting galleries in the city--leaked \n     the addresses of 90 known drug houses to a local newspaper. \n     The paper published the list and confronted the federal \n     police, who said they had never been given the list. ``We \n     published the list as proof that they'd received it,'' said \n     an editor. ``And they did nothing.''\n       Ruffo and others say even the judicial system has become \n     co-opted, by money or fear. ``Judges are afraid they might be \n     killed. It's very risky to confront this,'' Ruffo said. On \n     that, he shares the pessimism of many in northern Mexico: \n     ``If we can't even trust the judicial system, we have \n     nothing.''\n\n\n                         the mexican federation\n\n       Four organizations dominate the international drug trade in \n     northern Mexico. Together with about a dozen smaller groups, \n     they have been dubbed The Mexican Federation by the U.S. Drug \n     Enforcement Administration and gross an estimated $10 billion \n     to $30 billion annually in narcotics sales in the United \n     States. Family ties are important to the groups, most of \n     which can trace their lineage back decades to the cross-\n     border smuggling of contraband such as stolen cars.\n\n\n                           the tijuana cartel\n\n       Currently the second most powerful cartel. Considered the \n     most violent of the Mexican organizations. Best known for the \n     ambush of Catholic Cardinal Juan Jesus Posadas Ocampo at \n     Guadalajara Airport in May 1993.\n       Leaders: Arellano-Felix brothers--Benjamin, Ramon, Javier \n     and Francisco (currently jailed in Mexico)--who are the \n     nephews of Guadalajara Cartel co-founder Miguel Angel Felix \n     Gallardo.\n       Activities: Controls most of drug smuggling across the \n     California border; has recently diversified to become one of \n     the main suppliers of methamphetamine, consolidating its \n     position through a violent turf war in San Diego.\n\n\n                           the sonora cartel\n\n       Also known as the Caro Quintero organization; made up of \n     remnants of the old Guadalajara Cartel, best known for the \n     brutal 1985 torture and killing of DEA agent Enrique \n     Camarena.\n       Leaders/co-founders: Rafael Caro Quintero, under arrest. \n     Miguel Angel Felix Gallardo, arrested in 1989, remains a \n     major player from prison.\n       Acting leader: Miguel Caro Quintero, brother of Rafael.\n       Activities: Among the first Mexican organizations to \n     transport drugs for the Colombian kingpins. Main trafficking \n     routes through Arizona border area known as ``cocaine alley'' \n     with movements also coordinated through the Juarez Cartel in \n     the territory controlled by that organization.\n\n\n                           the juarez cartel\n\n       Currently the most powerful of the Mexican cartels.\n       Leader: Amado Carrillo Fuentes, about 40; took over in \n     1993. Shuns flamboyant lifestyle of his competitors, and is \n     said to represent a new breed of kingpin who believes in \n     compromising with rivals.\n       Activities: Carrillo Fuentes pioneered the use of Boeing \n     727s for bulk shipments of as much as 15 tons of cocaine \n     between South America and northern Mexico. Cartel operates \n     primarily through Juarez-El Paso and surrounding desert along \n     the west Texas and New Mexico borders.\n\n\n                            the gulf cartel\n\n       Once undisputed champ of the Mexican organizations. \n     Cartel's fortunes began to fade about a year ago after its \n     alleged kingpin, Juan Garcia Abrego, 51, had to go \n     underground. He was arrested in January and deported to the \n     United States, where he is standing trial in Houston.\n       Leader: Oscar Malherve, one of Abrego's top lieutenants and \n     money-launderers.\n       Activities: Moves drugs primarily through the Texas border \n     region, particularly Matamoros-Brownsville, and along the \n     Gulf coastal shores.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/05/03/senate-section/article/S4678-3", "month": "05", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "03", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4681]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  CITY OF MUNISING'S 100TH ANNIVERSARY\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I rise today to commemorate the 100th \nanniversary of the incorporation of the city of Munising, MI. In the \nChippewa language, Munising means Place of the Great Island.\n  Munising was first founded in 1850 when the Munising Co. bought \n87,000 acres of land on the eastern shore of Munising Bay. The land \nchanged hands for the next 20 years as businesses opened and closed in \nthe area.\n  In 1870, the beginnings of a thriving town were seen. The village of \n30 homes was centered around the blast furnace which had just begun \nproducing iron. The village had a blacksmith shop, sawmill, dock, and a \ngovernment lighthouse. The village continued to thrive until 1877, when \na fire destroyed the whole community.\n  By 1895, the lumber baron Timothy Nester had acquired 184,000 acres \nin Munising Bay. He quickly began work on a railroad to connect \nMunising to South Shore. A town was planned and several buildings were \nbuilt from the nearby lumber. In January 1896, a post office was opened \nto serve the town's 500 residents. In May 1896, the village was \nincorporated and Nester was named president. The new town expanded \nrapidly and after a year its residents numbered 3,500. The lumber \nindustry would continue to drive the expansion of the village for many \nyears to come.\n  Today, Munising is a small and vibrant community. Many people from \nMichigan and around the country come to Munising to experience the many \nactivities its natural beauty has to offer. I know that my Senate \ncolleagues join me in congratulating the city of Munising on its 100th \nanniversary.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/05/03/senate-section/article/S4681-1", "month": "05", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "03", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4681-S4682]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            RISE IN DRUG USE\n\n Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, earlier this week I and several of \nmy colleagues--Mr. Coverdell, Mr. Kyl, Mr. Nickles, Mr. Gramm, Mr. \nDomenici, Mr. Frist, and Mr. Craig--came to this floor to discuss the \ndisturbing rise in drug use in this country since the beginning of the \nClinton administration. Yesterday, the Wall Street Journal \neditorialized on the same subject. I ask that the editorial be printed \nin the Record.\n  The editorial follows:\n\n                           Waiting to Exhale\n\n       Now, in April 1996, with eight months left on a four-year \n     term, Bill Clinton flies the press into Miami so he can be \n     seen standing shoulder to shoulder with General Barry \n     McCaffrey, a decorated war hero he's enlisted to lead a war \n     on drugs. Standing among schoolchildren Monday, the President \n     poured his great rhetorical heart onto the drug war. Along \n     the way came these key words: ``Make no mistake about it, \n     this has got to be a bipartisan, American, nonpolitical \n     effort.'' Translation: Don't blame me for this problem, \n     especially during an election campaign.\n       In fact, Bill Clinton's retreat in the drug war is among \n     the worst sins for which his Administration should be held \n     accountable. After years of decline in drug use, recent \n     surveys make it clear that a younger generation of Americans \n     is again at risk. The number of 12-to-17-year-olds using \n     marijuana increased to 2.9 million in 1994 from 1.6 million \n     in 1992. Marijuana use increased 200% among 14-to-15-year-\n     olds during the same period. Since 1992, according to \n\n[[Page S4682]]\n\n     large surveys of high school students, there has been a 52% \n     increase in the number of seniors using drugs monthly. One in \n     three report having used marijuana in the past year. Private \n     anti-drug advocates such as Jim Burke of the Partnership for \n     a Drug Free America and Joe Califano of Columbia University's \n     Center on Addiction and Substance Abuse have been running \n     alongside this drug fire, yelling for help to anyone who'd \n     listen.\n       Better late than never, of course, and it is good that Mr. \n     Clinton wants to mend his ways with General McCaffrey. We \n     applaud the appointment and think General McCaffrey has \n     sounded many right notes. Legalization, he says, ``is out of \n     the question.''\n       A quarterly regional analysis put out by his office brings \n     the problem up to date: ``A recent New York State high school \n     survey reports that 12% of New York teens said that they \n     smoked marijuana at least four times a month, double the \n     number in the 1990 survey.'' Discussing ``Emerging Drugs.'' \n     the report notes methamphetamine's popularity in the San \n     Francisco area: ``in addition to its use by young users who \n     combine it with heroin (``a meth speedball'') it can also be \n     found in `biker's coffee,' a combination of methamphetamine \n     and coffee popular among young, fairly affluent urbanites.'' \n     Additionally, the report notes that ``Club drugs, a name \n     which generally includes MDMA, Ketamine, 2c-B, LSD, \n     psilocybin and a range of other hallucinogens, are \n     increasingly mentioned in this quarter.''\n       These recent events are not a coincidence. The drug retreat \n     was the result of a series of explicit policy decisions by \n     Mr. Clinton and those around him. Which is why we think it is \n     worth focusing on the meaning of his wish that the anti-drug \n     war be ``bipartisan, American, nonpolitical.'' This means \n     that between now and November's election no one is allowed to \n     utter the phrase ``didn't inhale.'' No one is allowed to \n     remember Surgeon General Joycelyn Elders talking about drug \n     legalization, even as her own son was arrested and convicted \n     on drug-sale charges.\n       Nor should anyone be allowed to bring up White House deputy \n     personnel director Patsy Thomasson's admission to a \n     congressional committee that some dozen White House \n     employees, including senior staff, had been ``requested to be \n     part of an individual drug testing program'' because of their \n     prior drug history. Ms. Thomasson's experience in these drug \n     mop-up duties extends back to her days in Arkansas when she \n     took over the business of Dan Lasater--Little Rock bond \n     dealer, Clinton campaign contributor and friend-of-brother \n     Roger--while Mr. Lasater served prison time for ``social \n     distribution'' of cocaine. This week Mr. Lasater is \n     testifying before the Senate Whitewater Committee, and we \n     assume he will be asked to enlighten the committee about \n     the millions of dollars of mysterious trades that his firm \n     made through an account without the knowledge of the \n     account's owner, Kentucky resident Dennis Patrick.\n       On matters of pure policy, among Bill Clinton's first acts \n     was to cut spending on the war. The staff of the Office of \n     National Drug Control Policy was cut to 25 from 146. Drug \n     interdiction funds were cut. The number of trafficker \n     aircraft seized by Customs fell to 10 from 37 in FY '93-'95. \n     Drug czar Lee Brown wandered the nation's editorial pages \n     seeking the public support he rarely got from his President. \n     New York Democratic Congressman Charles Rangel announced: ``I \n     really never thought I'd miss Nancy Reagan, but I do.''\n       Finally, about a year ago, Mr. Clinton received a stinging \n     letter from FBI Director Louis Freeh and DEA director Tom \n     Constantine, charging that the President's anti-drug effort \n     was adrift. So now we have General McCaffrey, who says, \n     ``There is no reason why we can't return America to a 1960s \n     level, pre-Vietnam era level of drug use.''\n       Sorry, General, but pre-Vietnam America is not coming back. \n     General McCaffrey's current President is a founding member of \n     the generation that transformed America in the years of \n     Vietnam and those that followed. It bequeathed to all of us a \n     culture and ethos of such personal and moral slovenliness \n     that we must now enlist a battle-hardened soldier to save the \n     children of the anti-Vietnam generation from drugs. It is \n     perhaps the most perfect, bitter irony that when these \n     parents now exhort their children to stop using marijuana (of \n     a strain that is significantly more potent than anything they \n     dabbled in), the kids reply: ``Why should we? We're not \n     hurting anyone.''\n       Basically, we'd very much like to know exactly why Bill \n     Clinton took a powder on the drug wars after he became \n     President. There was in fact a rationale of sorts offered at \n     the time for the change in tone and direction. In contrast to \n     what was thought to be the Republican approach of throwing \n     people in jail for drug offenses, the Clinton approach would \n     emphasize prevention and treatment. There is a case to be \n     made for prevention and treatment, but the heart of our \n     complaint with this President's attitude on drugs has to do \n     with what we would call it character, its moral content.\n       Unlike the Reagans, you will never see the Clintons \n     articulating the war on drugs as an essentially moral \n     crusade. With its emphasis on treatment and programs and \n     prevention, it is mainly the kind of effort that the \n     sociologist Philip Rieff identified as the triumph of the \n     therapeutic. Rather than the school-marmish Nancy Reagan, the \n     Clintons, like the generation of liberal constituencies that \n     they lead, are going to be rhetorically correct, believers in \n     the powers of bureaucratic healing--and nonjudgmental. In \n     their world, no one is ever quite caught for disastrous \n     personal behavior or choices. Instead of absolution, there \n     are explanations.\n       This, in our opinion, is the real reason the drug war waned \n     when Bill Clinton became President. The message this new \n     President sent to his young, yuppie, MTVish audiences was \n     that he was just too cool to go relentlessly moralistic over \n     something like recreational drugs. Sure he had an anti-drug \n     policy in 1992 and a czar and speeches, but Bill Clinton \n     wasn't going to have any cows over the subject. Surely, the \n     drug-testing White House staff understood that much.\n       We don't doubt that a lot of people in this country, \n     especially parents of teenaged and pre-teen children, would \n     very much like to rediscover General McCaffrey's pre-Vietnam \n     world of less constant cultural challenge. But the people who \n     turned that culture upside down, making it a daily challenge \n     for parents, have at last been given the chance to run the \n     government. But this death-bed conversion on drugs simply \n     lacks credibility. As much as we applaud General McCaffrey's \n     new offensive, only a triumph of hope over experience could \n     lead anyone to believe it would be sustained past November if \n     Mr. Clinton and his crowd are returned to the White \n     House.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/05/03/senate-section/article/S4681-2", "month": "05", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "03", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4682-S4683]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        WHY NO HELP TO LIBERIA?\n\n Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, the tragedy of Liberia should be of \nconcern to all Americans.\n  I have twice visited that battle-scarred country which has more ties \nto the United States historically than any other nation of Africa.\n  And the United States bears a partial responsibility for what is \nhappening there.\n  I'm pleased that the latest reports show that there is relative \nstability temporarily, but I am confident that this relative stability \nwill be broken once again unless the nations move together effectively \nunder U.S. leadership.\n  The ECOMOG forces have brought some stability but there needs to be a \nstronger indication of interest outside of Africa also. Bishop John H. \nRicard, chairman of the board for Catholic Relief Services, had an op-\ned piece in the Washington Post, which I ask to be printed in the \nRecord after my remarks. I hope his article will stir policymakers a \nlittle more.\n  He eloquently pleads for help to this needy, desperate country.\n  The article follows:\n\n                        Why No Help to Liberia?\n\n                          (By John H. Richard)\n\n       When the leaders of Liberia's warring factions signed a \n     peace agreement in Abuja, Nigeria, last August, they did not \n     ask for American troops to back it up. They did not ask us to \n     broker the peace or shed our blood. What they did ask for was \n     a credible force of properly equipped peacekeepers to \n     persuade combatants to give up their weapons.\n       They knew that this relatively modest assistance would \n     provide stability and give the country an opportunity to \n     rejoin the rest of the world. The signatories to the \n     agreement had hoped that Liberia-like Bosnia, Haiti, Kuwait \n     and Somalia--might qualify for the type of aid necessary to \n     give the nation a chance.\n       Rejected by the international community, Liberians were \n     left to face the formidable tasks of nation-building without \n     the assistance that might have seen them through those tasks. \n     Perhaps the violence we witnessed last week would have \n     happened anyway. The sad truth is we won't ever know whether \n     a stronger American and International commitment might have \n     helped Liberia avoid this bloodshed.\n       Liberian warlords cannot be excused for the terror \n     inflicted in Monrovia over the past week, but neither can we \n     place the blame entirely on Africa's doorstep. Liberia's West \n     African neighbors, committed to bringing peace to the region, \n     brought the warring parties to the negotiating table more \n     than a dozen times since fighting broke out in the fall of \n     1990, and scores of African peacekeepers have given their \n     lives to end the war. When the accord was signed, the fueding \n     leaders established a functioning government that all parties \n     upheld for nearly five months.\n       As skirmishes flared up-country, one or another of the \n     Liberian leaders traveled to the point of conflict to settle \n     it. It was not exactly a constitutional system, but the \n     Liberian Council of State represented the resolve of a \n     critical mass of Liberians to achieve peace. They were \n     willing to continue, and they need our help.\n       It is impossible to say whether there would be peace in \n     Liberia today if the United Nations Security Council had made \n     the sort of commitment there that it has made in other parts \n     of the world. But the international community never gave the \n     African peace agreement a chance.\n       A week ago, international donors meeting in Brussels agreed \n     that it would take $1.2 billion to begin the reconstruction \n     of Bosnia. Last September, the same international donors \n     rejected a $110 million U.N. appeal to finance \n     demilitarization, resettlement and economic rehabilitation in \n     Liberia, demanding that African nations shoulder more of\n\n[[Page S4683]]\n\n     the burden. The achievement of peace in the region is not \n     a question of cash. But the vast disparity between \n     monetary commitments in Eastern Europe and West Africa is \n     telling; reflective perhaps of a basic unwillingness on \n     the part of wealthier nations to meet Africans halfway in \n     their efforts to build peace.\n       Last fall, Catholic Relief Services and other humanitarian \n     organizations in Liberia warned the United States and \n     European governments that if the peace process in Liberia was \n     not supported, it would unravel. U.N. Secretary General \n     Boutros-Boutros Ghali and Ghanaian President Jerry Rawlings \n     noted at the time that the annual U.N. budget for Liberia \n     would last only five days in the former Yugoslavia.\n       Without the support needed to foster a peaceful transition, \n     war returned quickly. Disagreements that a well-established \n     democracy would weather easily turned into life-and-death \n     struggles. The resulting horror is an example of a fledgling \n     government's inability to solve its problems. But tragically, \n     it is also an example of our vacillation, of our reluctance \n     to provide the sort of support and companionship that could \n     have seen Liberians through the dark but hopeful days of an \n     early peace.\n       In Liberia, thousands of teenage fighters have not only \n     been denied formal education during the years of mayhem, but \n     in fact have never learned how to be members of society; they \n     know only how to kill. These boy soldiers, having grown up \n     killing, realized as the Abuja agreement dissolved that there \n     would be no alternative to war; there would be no chance to \n     learn a way to make a living without a gun, or even to \n     develop into normal human beings. Already robbed of the \n     luxury of human emotion, they would also be denied the \n     opportunity to leave behind the violent life they had always \n     known.\n       By January, the peace was undone, and today Monrovia burns. \n     The people of the United States and the members of the \n     Security Council must ready themselves to pacify Liberia and \n     reconstruct the country from the ground up, again. As \n     Americans, we cannot throw up our hands and walk away. Why \n     not? Because Liberians are not all warlords. They are farmers \n     and merchants, women and children; they are our brothers and \n     sisters. And they need our support.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/05/03/senate-section/article/S4682-1", "month": "05", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "03", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4683]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   TRIBUTE TO GEORGE W.

Mr. President, my colleague, Senator Connie Mack, \nand I join in a special tribute to one of the great business leaders of \nthis century and a pioneer entrepreneur in food retailing: Mr. George \nW. Jenkins, Jr.\n  After a full and rewarding life, George Jenkins died peacefully in \nhis sleep in Lakeland, FL, on April 8, 1996. He was 88.\n  Today, we salute the memory of this outstanding person, who \npersonified the economic expansion of Florida in the 20th Century and \nthe commitment to excellence in commerce.\n  On the eve of the Great Depression, George Jenkins invested funds he \nhad been saving to buy a car in the first Publix grocery store. That \nwas 1930. Since then, Publix has evolved into one of the largest \nsupermarket operations in the Nation, with more than 500 stores in \nFlorida, Georgia, and South Carolina, and annual sales exceeding $9 \nbillion.\n  Publix employees affectionately referred to their founder as ``Mr. \nGeorge.'' Consumer Reports, in 1993, rated Publix tops in America in \ncustomer service.\n  In most endeavors, the positive assessment of one's peers is perhaps \nthe highest accolade. To say that George Jenkins' peers respected him \nwould amount to understatement; they revered him as a genius in food \nretailing.\n  George Jenkins will long be remembered for his business leadership, \nbut also for his generosity and love of family. His philanthropy for \nUnited Way, the Boy Scouts of America, and other beneficiaries touched \ncountless lives.\n  Florida is a better place and America is a stronger nation because \nGeorge Jenkins shared his special talents and his giving spirit through \nmuch of this century.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/05/03/senate-section/article/S4683-1", "month": "05", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "03", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4683-S4684]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  THE ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION REFORM BILL\n\n Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I voted for the illegal immigration \nreform bill before the Senate yesterday. The final bill is a much more \nbalanced approach than what was first proposed in committee. \nImportantly, the illegal immigration reform bill deals only with \nillegal immigration, and expanding deeming for legally sponsored \nimmigrants.\n  I supported dealing with illegal immigration separately from legal \nimmigration because of my concern that if the two issues were dealt \nwith together, as first proposed, legal immigration would be swept up \nin very different issues surrounding illegal immigration.\n  The illegal immigration bill sets necessary and clear limits while \ncontinuing America's history of being a nation of immigrants.\n  In recent years, illegal immigration has become an issue of serious \nlegislative and national security concern. The bombing of the World \nTrade Center in New York City by undocumented aliens led the Clinton \nadministration and various Members of Congress to propose legislation \nreforming the immigration process in the United States, particularly \npolitical asylum.\n  This illegal immigration bill deals with stopping illegal immigration \non two fronts--at our borders by keeping illegal aliens out in the \nfirst place, and within our borders for those who have entered the \nUnited States legally but are now here illegally.\n  It improves the controlling and policing of our borders from illegal \nentry by increasing border patrol and INS inspectors. It also addresses \nthe magnet of jobs and public assistance that has attracted illegal \nimmigrants to the United States by authorizing a series of pilot \nprojects to verify eligibility for employment in the United States and \nfor receiving public assistance and by establishing a program to \ndevelop tamper proof birth certificates and driver's licenses to reduce \ntheir vulnerability to forgery.\n  This bill also increases the number of border patrol agents by 4,700 \nover 5 years. It adds 300 full-time INS investigators over 3 years to \nenforce alien smuggling and employment laws.\n  It also deals with the fact that half of all illegal aliens in the \nUnited States came here legally--they then overstayed their visas and \nare now here illegally. We can't eliminate the problem of illegal \nimmigration only by policing our borders. We must also find ways to \nkeep people from coming here legally as tourists or students and not \nleaving. The bill deals with this in a number of ways, but its major \nthrust is clamping down on the magnets that attract illegal aliens in \nthe first place by eliminating access to U.S. jobs and taxpayer \nsupported benefits.\n  In order to block illegal aliens from working and receiving public \nassistance employers and administrators of public assistance need to \nhave a reliable way to know who is eligible to work or to receive \nbenefits and who isn't. It has been illegal since 1986 to hire illegal \naliens, but far too many are working and taking jobs from American \ncitizens and legal permanent residents. The relative ease of access to \nU.S. jobs is what is drawing illegal aliens to the United States. The \nmain reason the current system is not working as it should is because \nwe don't have an accurate or forgery-proof way to verify employment \neligibility.\n  This bill attempts to address this issue. It simplifies the existing \ncumbersome employment verification system by reducing the number of \nacceptable documents that can be used by employers to verify a person's \neligibility to work. It lays the groundwork to develop a new \nverification system for employment and public assistance eligibility. \nThe INS is directed to conduct several local and regional pilot \nprojects to demonstrate the feasibility of alternative systems for \nverifying eligibility. The pilot programs can last from 4 to 7 years in \nan effort to find a workable system. Congress must approve any \npermanent program.\n  The bill language specifically takes steps to protect privacy and \nguard against anti discrimination. It also contains language to protect \nprivacy and criteria to reduce the burden and cost to business.\n  The verification system aims to eliminate counterfeit documents by \nrequiring that any document required for verification must be tamper \nresistant. However, the legislation makes clear that this document may \nnot be required as a national identification card. Importantly, \nemployers are not liable if they hire a person in good faith who is \nlater found to have been ineligible.\n  The bill reinforces and strengthens current U.S. immigration law \nrequirements that immigrants be self-supporting and that they not \nbecome a public charge. Legal immigrants are accepted into the United \nStates under the condition that their sponsors, not the taxpayer, will \nbe responsible for them. This bill holds them to that promise. It\n\n[[Page S4684]]\n\nrequires sponsors of immigrants to take greater responsibility for \nthose they bring into the United States by making the affidavit of \nsupport which they sign a legally binding document.\n  The bill also counts the sponsor's income as part of the immigrant's \nincome for purposes of determining eligibility for public assistance, a \nprocess known as deeming for an expanded range of public assistance \nprograms. I believe this provision is in line with immigrants' pledge \nof self-sufficiency and that they will not become a public charge. By \nexpanding the number of programs that require deeming, we are holding \nimmigrants to their commitment and requiring their sponsors, not the \nGovernment, take responsibility for them. I supported a Simon amendment \nthat would have eliminated retroactive deeming requirements in the \nbill. I believe in deeming requirements to assure that sponsors and the \nlegal immigrants that they sponsor meet the responsibilities they have \npromised to meet, but I think it's unfair to apply new rules after the \nfact to those who are already here. Unfortunately, that amendment was \ndefeated.\n  I voted for a Kennedy amendment that would have excluded pregnant \nwomen, children and veterans from deeming requirements for Medicaid. \nUnfortunately, that amendment was also defeated.\n  Under the bill, illegal immigrants, who have broken U.S. laws and \nhave no legal right to be here, are prohibited from using any Federal, \nState, or local benefit, with minor exceptions related to public health \ninterests.\n  Mr. President, in conclusion, it is time we dealt firmly and directly \nwith illegal immigration. This bill, while not perfect, makes a good \neffort to put in place the procedures and resources necessary to reduce \nillegal immigration. \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/05/03/senate-section/article/S4683-2", "month": "05", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "03", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4684]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      CHEMICAL WEAPONS CONVENTION\n\n Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, on Thursday of last week, the Senate \nForeign Relations Committee reported favorably, by a 13 to 5 vote, the \nresolution of ratification of the Chemical Weapons Convention [CWC]. I \napplaud the committee's action and the leadership of Senators Lugar, \nPell, Kassebaum, Kerry, and Biden, not to mention the hard work of the \ncommittee staff, to advance this major arms control treaty. I hope that \nfloor consideration can be scheduled as early as possible. While I \nrealize that there may be difficulties on the floor, this treaty is of \nsuch importance that it would be an abrogation of our responsibility, \nwhen it is out of committee and ready to go, not to provide advice and \nconsent before the end of this Congress.\n  I note that Majority Leader Dole stated on December 7 of last year \nthat it was his intention that the Senate would consider the Convention \nin a reasonable time period once the Convention is on the Executive \nCalendar. Well, the Chemical Weapons Convention is now on the calendar, \nand the reasonable time clock is ticking.\n  As all major arms control treaties must be, the CWC is a bipartisan \nmeasure. It was negotiated during the Reagan administration, signed by \nPresident Bush, and submitted to the Senate by President Clinton. It \nwas approved by a strong bipartisan majority of the Foreign Relations \nCommittee. It is endorsed by arms control advocates and the Chemical \nManufacturers Association. Some critics of the CWC have sought to blame \nthe Democrats for failing to ratify the Convention when they controlled \nthe Senate. Yes, the Senate should have acted on the CWC in 1994, but \nthat fact does not provide a reason not to act in 1996. The sooner we \ncan ratify the Convention, the sooner we can eliminate these horrible \nweapons.\n  While U.S. accession to the treaty is not a legal requirement for the \ntreaty to enter into force, it has become a practical requirement. The \ncase of the CWC is yet another example of the continued primacy of U.S. \nleadership in international politics. Ratification by 65 countries is \nnecessary for the CWC to enter into force. Currently, only 49 have done \nso, and it has become clear that many are waiting for U.S. \nratification. Why? For one, because the United States maintains one of \nthe two largest stockpiles of chemical weapons. But more fundamentally, \nbecause nations continue to look to the United States for leadership in \nmatters of great international import. President George Bush wrote in \n1994: ``United States leadership is required once again to bring this \nhistoric agreement into force.'' This remains true today. Prompt action \nis our responsibility.\n  Critics of the CWC, and there appear to be few, argue that U.S. \nsecurity is harmed by our approval of a treaty that binds us to destroy \na class of weapons we currently possess, while citing that certain \n``rogue'' states have not signed the treaty and raising questions over \nRussian compliance. They argue that, by proceeding to eliminate its \nchemical weapons stockpile under the CWC, the United States is \ndepriving itself of a deterrent capability against any state that \nmaintains some CW capacity. However, deterrence is based on the ability \nto respond in kind, and that assumes that chemical weapons are a \nlegitimate instrument of warfare for the U.S. military.\n  The fundamental basis behind the CWC, however, is that chemical \nweapons are not legitimate for war-fighting. This consensus goes back \nto World War I, where the invidious use of mustard gas prompted the \n1925 Geneva Protocol to prohibit the use of chemical warfare agents. \nMore recently, the Iraqi attacks on the Kurds in 1988 and the Sarin gas \nattack on the Tokyo subway last year have reminded the international \ncommunity of the terror of chemical weapons. Try as we might to \nstigmatize chemical weapons through other means, there can be no \nsubstitute for, in the words of President Bush's National Security \nAdvisor Gen. Brent Scowcroft, ``the clear international norms against \nchemical weapons, the legal framework, and the challenge inspections \nembodied in the Chemical Weapons Convention.''\n  A chemical weapons deterrent capability for the United States is not \nonly unnecessary, it is inconceivable. If U.S. troops or territory were \nsubject to a chemical attack, our military has ample means to respond \nin conventional ways, if a military response were deemed appropriate. \nDefense Secretary William Perry testified last month to the Foreign \nRelations Committee that ``we have an effective range of capabilities \nto protect against, to deter, or to retaliate against the use of \nchemical weapons * * *'' JCS Chairman Gen. John Shalikashvili testified \nin 1994 that ``while forgoing the ability to retaliate in kind, the \nU.S. military retains the wherewithal to deter and defend against a \nchemical attack.'' Additionally, I doubt that many Americans would feel \ncomfortable with having a military that is prepared to wage gas attacks \non foreign populations. In essence, how could we ask the world to make \nillegal these weapons, if we reserve the right to their legitimate use?\n  There are a number of other criticisms of the CWC to address, and I \nhope to do so at a later time. Simply put, the CWC will improve our \nnational security by establishing the legal basis, the timetable and \nthe verification regime necessary to ban chemical weapons. I am pleased \nthat the Foreign Relations Committee has finally reported out the \nConvention, and I hope that we can proceed to give our advice and \nconsent as soon as possible.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/05/03/senate-section/article/S4684-1", "month": "05", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "03", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4684-S4685]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  THE VETERANS' ADMINISTRATION BUDGET\n\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, just to follow up very briefly on what the \nmajority leader said, the Wall Street Journal earlier this week pointed \nout that the tax increases in 1993 had the effect of costing jobs and \neconomic growth in this country. Two economists, William Beach and \nScott Hodge, at the Heritage Foundation, used the very reputable \neconometric model, the Washington University macro model, to try to \nfigure out what happened as a result of that 1993 budget deal. They \ncalculated it reduced private sector jobs by 1.2 million. We lost $208 \nbillion in output, or the equivalent of $2,100 per family. What is \nworse, they found out the tax increases did not reduce the deficit as \nmuch as predicted because tax increases change behavior and not all the \ntaxes were generated. Only about 56 cents of additional deficit \nreduction came for every $1 of new taxes. So that did not work very \nwell.\n  Now the majority leader has talked about how we need to get the \nbudget in balance by cutting spending. I wanted to share very briefly \ntoday with my colleagues something that went on in\n\n[[Page S4685]]\n\nour appropriations subcommittee for VA and HUD today. We had before us \nthe Secretary of the agency, Secretary Brown. We showed him the budget \nprojections. This chart shows what the Congress' budget projection was \nlast year. This green line shows a flat line across here.\n  Actually, we raised that to this level. Last year the Secretary said \nholding the Veterans' Administration budget flat through 2002 would be \ndevastating; hospitals would be closed, veterans would not be served, \nthere would be tremendous hardship, the system could not operate. He \nsaid the system could not operate with flat appropriations, even though \nthe number of veterans is declining.\n  So I asked him what would happen, because this is the Clinton \nprojection. These are the Clinton administration numbers for the \nVeterans' Administration budget, going up here in 1997, one more year, \nand then just plummeting, plummeting by more than $3 billion a year out \nof just slightly over a $16 billion budget. This, coming down according \nto the CBO, this would be just around $13 billion or less for the \nVeterans' Administration.\n  The Secretary said he could not live with, and the veterans could not \nbe served by, that budget. So I asked him if he were going to send out \nthe e-mail messages and statements in pay stubs that he had sent to the \nemployees of the VA last year when we proposed this budget. He said no. \nI asked him why not. He said, because the President has personally \nassured him he will negotiate the budget with him and take care of the \nveterans.\n  I asked him, I said, ``Are you concerned that the President is going \nto live with that budget number that shows the budget plummeting for \nVA?'' He indicated to me that he had no concern whatsoever that the \nVeterans' Administration budget would fall like that, because the \nPresident promised to negotiate with him.\n  I had to ask the question, and I ask it again. Who is the President \nfooling? Is he fooling the taxpayers and Congress when he proposes a \nbudget like that that purports to cut it and cut the budget for the \nVeterans' Administration a total of $13 billion in this period? Or is \nhe fooling the veterans by telling them, do not worry, we will keep \nspending up however high it needs to go? Whichever way it goes, it has \nto call into question whether the President is serious about these \nbudget negotiations. He said that he wants to balance the budget.\n  We have the President on record and we have OMB on record as saying \nthey want to balance the budget. How are they going to do it? Well, \nthey have some very draconian cuts in their appropriated spending \naccounts. This red line shows how sharply those cuts are going to be \nmade. This is the President's entire budget, and he hopes to get to a \nbalance in 2002 by cutting it like that.\n  Part of those cuts are reflected in this precipitous cut in the VA \nbudget, showing this for the Veterans' Administration only. But he is \ntelling the people, the constituents of the Veterans' Administration, \nor they believe he is saying, ``Don't worry, we'll negotiate with you a \ngood budget and take care of you.''\n  We have the promise, on the one hand, of OMB that this is a \nmeaningful budget that shows a reduction of appropriated spending \nsufficient to balance the budget in the year 2002 under President \nClinton's plan. On the other hand, we have the assurance, the \nconfidence of one of the agency administrators whose budget is going to \nbe slashed that it will not be slashed. That is the best of both \npossible worlds.\n  For the vast majority of American citizens who want to see a balanced \nbudget, you have these numbers in a budget, but it is really a no pain-\nno gain situation, because you tell the people who will be directly \naffected, ``Don't worry because we don't mean this; don't worry, the \nbudget's not going to come down like that.''\n  Mr. President, what they must be telling us is it is all for show. It \nsounds good to tell the American people we are going to balance the \nbudget, but we can sure get out and get the word to all of the people \nwho depend upon those particular agencies, ``Don't worry, your agency \nis not being cut; your agency is not going to suffer any reductions.''\n  Mr. President, I think the issue of credibility and character are \ngoing to be very important in this fall's election, and I think this \nbudget flimflam tells a lot. I think it raises questions about the \nhonesty of the plan that we are being presented on behalf of the \nClinton administration by OMB. They would like us to think the budget \nis going to be balanced, but they assure the people in the area, plan \nfor the cuts, that that $13 billion will not be cut out of the VA \nbudget. Is it going to be cut someplace else? I doubt they will be \nwilling to say someplace else will be cut even more.\n  I thank the Chair. I note several colleagues wishing to speak.

Mr. President, today the Senate considers H.R. 1743, a \nbill to reauthorize the Water Resources Research Act of 1984, as \namended. This legislation was adopted unanimously by the House of \nRepresentatives on October 17, 1995. With the strong support of \nSenators Kempthorne, Thomas, and Reid, the Committee on Environment and \nPublic Works approved the measure with an amendment on March 28 of this \nyear.\n  The legislation, which enjoys broad bipartisan support, extends the \nauthorization for the State Water Resources Research Institutes for 5 \nyears. Fifty-four of these institutes have been established at land \ngrant universities in each of the 50 States, Washington, DC, and 3 of \nthe territories.\n  These institutes are a primary link between the academic community, \nthe water-related research and regulatory personnel in our State and \nFederal agencies, and various interests in the private sector. The \ninstitutes provide a mechanism for promoting State, regional, and \nnational coordination of water resources research and training. They \nalso serve as a network to facilitate research coordination and \ninformation transfer. Their programs are coordinated with the general \nguidance of the Secretary of the Interior.\n  Mr. President, this is a popular program because research from the \nwater institutes is often directed at finding solutions to particular \nwater problems at the local or regional level. Research results from \nthe program are often applied to real-world problems in water \nmanagement. In my own State, the University of Rhode Island's Water \nResources Center has used this program to further ground water \nresources management and protection, wetlands preservation, and the \nunderstanding of the effects of air pollutant deposition on lakes and \nstreams.\n  Nationally, this program is designed to address water resource \nmanagement problems such as: the abundance and quality of water \nsupplies, the sources of water contaminants and methods of remediation, \nand the training of research scientists, engineers, and technicians. In \naddition to continuing the general authority for the institutes, this \nbill extends authorization for the awarding of funds for research \nprojects.\n  Mr. President, let me conclude by explaining the authorization of \nappropriations made in this bill. The 1984 act authorized $10 million \nannually to cover all general water resources research for the \ninstitutes. H.R. 1743, as approved by the House and reported by the \ncommittee, authorizes the institutional grants program at lower levels. \nBeginning with fiscal year 1996, $5 million is authorized. For fiscal \nyears 1997 and 1998, $7 million is authorized. For fiscal years 1999 \nand 2000, $9 million is authorized. This provides the institutional \ngrant program with a 5-year authorization total of $37 million.\n  Finally, the Committee on Environment and Public Works unanimously \nadopted an amendment offered by Senator Thomas to add funding for \nresearch focused exclusively on water problems of an interstate nature. \nFor interstate research, the bill authorizes $3million for each of the \nfiscal years 1996 through 2000, for a total of $15 million.\n  Mr. President, the Water Resources Research Program authorized by \nH.R. 1743 is a cost-effective program. Costs of operating the program \nare shared with non-Federal interests. The program provides valuable \nresearch that is useful to State and local water managers throughout \nthe Nation. This program has given us years of valuable service and I \nurge my colleagues to support H.R. 1743.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/05/03/senate-section/article/S4685-3", "month": "05", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "03", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4686]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n THE TRINITY RIVER BASIN FISH AND WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT REAUTHORIZATION \n                              ACT OF 1996\n\n  The bill (H.R. 2243) to amend the Trinity River Basin Fish and \nWildlife Management Act of 1984, to extend for 3 years the availability \nof moneys for the restoration of fish and wildlife in the Trinity \nRiver, and for other purposes, was considered, ordered to a third \nreading, read the third time, and passed.\n  Mr. CHAFEE.

The bill would extend funding authority for Trinity River basin \nrestoration programs through fiscal year 1998. In addition, H.R. 2243 \nwould expand the management plan to aid in the resumption of commercial \nand recreational fishing, and increase the task force by five members \nto include representatives from commercial and recreational fishing \ninterests, two native American tribes, and the timber industry. The \nadministration supports H.R. 2243.\n  To date, restoration efforts in the Trinity River basin have included \nthe modernization of the Lewiston hatchery, the construction of the \nBuckhorn Debris Dam, sediment collection pools in the Grass Valley \nCreek, and the purchase of 17,000 acres of highly erodible land in the \nGrass Valley Watershed. Other habitat restoration efforts are underway \nto encourage natural fish spawning and rearing, including replacement \nof spawning gravel below the Lewiston Dam, reestablishment of meander \nchannels, dredging of pools in the Trinity River, and feather-tapering \nthe river's edges.\n  Reauthorization of Public Law 98-514 will continue the restoration of \nthe Grass Valley Creek Watershed, control sediment on tributary \nwatersheds, restore the South Forks Trinity River fish habitat, and \nimplement a wildlife management program. These efforts will contribute \nto rebuilding the populations of salmon and trout, which are important \nto commercial, recreational, and tribal fishing interests.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/05/03/senate-section/article/S4686-1", "month": "05", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "03", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4686-S4688]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n     THE WATER DESALINIZATION RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT ACT OF 1996\n\n  The Senate proceeded to consider the bill (S. 811) to authorize \nresearch into the desalinization and reclamation of water and authorize \na program for States, cities, or qualifying agencies desiring to own \nand operate a water desalinization or reclamation facility to develop \nsuch facilities, and for other\n\n[[Page S4687]]\n\npurposes, which had been reported from the Committee on Environment and \nPublic Works, with an amendment to strike all after the enacting clause \nand inserting in lieu thereof the following:\n\n     SECTION 1.

MISCELLANEOUS AUTHORITIES.\n\n       In carrying out sections 4 and 5, the Secretary of the \n     Interior and the Secretary of the Army may--\n       (1) accept technical and administrative assistance from a \n     State or other public entities and from private persons in \n     connection with research and development activities relating \n     to desalinization and reclamation of water;\n       (2) enter into contracts or agreements stating the purpose \n     for which the assistance is contributed and, in appropriate \n     circumstances, providing for the sharing of costs between the \n     Secretary and such entities or persons;\n       (3) make grants to educational and scientific institutions;\n       (4) contract with educational and scientific institutions \n     and engineering and industrial firms;\n       (5) by competition or noncompetitive contract or any other \n     means, engage the services of necessary personnel, industrial \n     and engineering firms, and educational institutions;\n       (6) use the facilities and personnel of Federal, State, \n     municipal, and private scientific laboratories;\n       (7) contract for or establish and operate facilities and \n     tests to conduct research, testing, and development necessary \n     for the purposes of this Act;\n       (8) acquire processes, data, inventions, patent \n     applications, patents, licenses, lands, interests in land and \n     water, facilities, and other property by purchase, license, \n     lease, or donation;\n       (9) assemble and maintain domestic and foreign scientific \n     literature and issue pertinent bibliographical data;\n       (10) conduct inspections and evaluations of domestic and \n     foreign facilities and cooperate and participate in their \n     development;\n       (11) conduct and participate in regional, national, and \n     international conferences relating to the desalinization of \n     water;\n       (12) coordinate, correlate, and publish information that \n     will advance the development of the desalinization of water; \n     and\n       (13) cooperate with Federal, State, and municipal \n     departments, agencies, and instrumentalities, and with \n     private persons, firms, educational institutions, and other \n     organizations, including foreign governments, departments, \n     agencies, companies, and instrumentalities, in effectuating \n     the purposes of this Act.\n\n     SEC. 7. DESALINIZATION CONFERENCE.\n\n       (a) Establishment.--The President is requested to instruct \n     the Administrator of the Agency for International Development \n     to sponsor an international desalinization conference within \n     1 year after the date of enactment of this Act.\n       (b) Participants.--Participants in the conference under \n     subsection (a) should include scientists, private industry \n     experts, desalinization experts and operators, government \n     officials from the nations that use and conduct research on \n     desalinization, and government officials from nations that \n     could benefit from low-cost desalinization technology \n     (particularly nations in the developing world), and \n     international financial institutions.\n       (c) Purpose.--The conference under subsection (a) shall--\n       (1) explore promising new technologies and methods to make \n     affordable desalinization a reality in the near term; and\n       (2) propose a research agenda and a plan of action to guide \n     longer-term development of practical desalinization \n     applications.\n\n[[Page S4688]]\n\n       (d) Funding.--\n       (1) AID funds.--Funding for the conference under subsection \n     (a) may come from operating or program funds of the Agency \n     for International Development.\n       (2) Other nations.--The Agency for International \n     Development shall encourage financial and other support from \n     other nations, including those that have desalinization \n     technology and those that might benefit from such technology.\n\n     SEC. 8. REPORTS.\n\n       (a) In General.--Not later than 1 year after the date of \n     enactment of this Act, and annually thereafter, the Secretary \n     of the Interior, in consultation with the Secretary of the \n     Army, shall prepare a report to the President and Congress \n     concerning the administration of this Act.\n       (b) Contents.--A report under subsection (a) shall \n     describe--\n       (1) the actions taken by the Secretary of the Interior and \n     the Secretary of the Army during the calendar year preceding \n     the year in which the report is submitted; and\n       (2) the actions planned for the following calendar year.\n\n     SEC. 9. AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS.\n\n       (a) Research and Development.--There are authorized to be \n     appropriated to carry out section 4--\n       (1) $5,000,000 for fiscal year 1997; and\n       (2) $7,500,000 for each of fiscal years 1998 through 2001.\n       (b) Desalinization Development Program.--There are \n     authorized to be appropriated to carry out section 5 such \n     sums as are necessary, up to a total of $40,000,000 for the \n     period consisting of fiscal years 1997 through 2001, of which \n     50 percent shall be made available to the Department of the \n     Interior and 50 percent shall be made available to the civil \n     works program of the Army Corps of Engineers.\n\n  The committee amendment was agreed to.\n  The bill (S. 811) was deemed read the third time and passed.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, today the Senate has passed S. 811, the \nWater Desalinization and Research and Development Act. This \nlegislation, which was approved by the full Senate in both 1992 and \n1994, is sponsored by Senators Simon, Reid, Mack, and others.\n  Very briefly, Mr. President, S. 811 authorizes an expanded U.S. \nresearch and development program with the goal of producing lower cost \ndesalinization technologies. The bill assigns primary program \nresponsibility to the Department of the Interior, in coordination with \nthe Army Corps of Engineers.\n  In addition to the basic research and development program, S. 811 \nauthorizes the development of experimental desalination facilities and \nrequires the Agency for International Development to host a conference \nfor countries either currently using or planning to use desalinization \ntechnologies.\n  Mr. President, in the face of growing domestic water shortages, as \nwell as strategic international concerns, this legislation is designed \nto increase the U.S. commitment to developing more economical \ndesalinization technology.\n  S. 811, as reported, authorizes $5 million in fiscal year 1997 for \nthe basic research and development at the Interior Department; $7.5 \nmillion is authorized for this purpose in each of fiscal years 1998 \nthrough 2001, for a 5-year total of $35 million.\n  For the facility development program, $40 million is authorized for \nfiscal years 1997 through 2001. I note that the total authorization for \nappropriations in this bill is $20 million less than the $95 million \nprovided in the bill as introduced.\n  I thank Senator Simon and the others who support this bill for \nworking with us to reduce the authorization levels. Based upon the very \nlimited amount of discretionary funding that will be available over the \nnext 5 to 7 years, we have no choice but to do more with less in this \narea.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/05/03/senate-section/article/S4686-2", "month": "05", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "03", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4688-S4690]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  AMAGANSETT NATIONAL WILDLIFE REFUGE\n\n  Mr. COHEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to the immediate consideration of Calendar No. 378, H.R. 1836.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (H.R. 1836) to authorize the Secretary of the \n     Interior to acquire property in the town of East Hampton, \n     Suffolk County, New York, for inclusion in the Amagansett \n     National Wildlife Refuge.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the immediate \nconsideration of the bill?\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, I rise today in support of H.R. 1836 \nwhich will allow for the protection of New York's rarest plant species, \nthe sandplain gerardia--also a federally endangered species--and six \nother rare plants while offering New Yorkers with spectacular \nrecreational opportunities. I was happy to cosponsor identical \nlegislation, S. 1422, which was introduced by my friend and colleague \nSenator Moynihan. This bill will authorize the U.S. Fish and Wildlife \nService to purchase a parcel of land on the South Fork of Long Island \nknown as Shadmoor.\n  The Shadmoor property is a one-half mile stretch of sand, plants, and \nwildlife habitat fronted by 70-foot cliffs that reminded early settlers \nof the English moors. It is not only home to a number of rare and \nendangered plants, but also a wetland visited by several species of \nmigratory birds. Also, the property is of interest to history buffs, as \nthe property contains several bunkers constructed for the defense of \nAmerica's coastline during World War II. It is truly a unique area that \nmany will agree needs to be maintained.\n  Currently, this beachfront land with its wonderful vistas and serene \nbeauty is threatened by development. However, because of the need to \nprotect the sandplain gerardia, in order to provide for the habitat for \nmigratory birds, and for the recreational opportunities it affords to \nall New Yorkers, it is an area that must be given proper and prompt \nconsideration. This bill achieves these goals by allowing for the \nacquisition of this land for the purposes of preserving it for \ngenerations to come.\n  In addition, an amendment to this bill will make a technical \ncorrection in the maps of the Coastal Barrier Resources System [COBRA]. \nThis amendment is identical to S. 1352 which I introduced earlier this \nyear with my friend and colleague Senator Moynihan. In addition, \nCongressman Forbes introduced similar legislation, H.R. 2005, which \npassed the House of Representatives on October 30, 1995.\n  Mr. President, the administration testified in support of the \ncorrection contained in this amendment before the Oceans, Fisheries, \nand Wildlife Subcommittee of the House Committee on Resources. The \nDepartment of the Interior's Fish and Wildlife Service acknowledges \nthat it was in error when it designated part of the Point O' Woods \ncommunity on Fire Island in New York as part of an otherwise protected \narea. This legislation directs the Secretary of the Interior to correct \nthis error and thereby allow the residents of the Point O' Woods \ncommunity to participate in the National Flood Insurance Program \n[NFIP]. It will ease community efforts to relocate houses away from \nhigh erosion zones and allow the community to practice effective \ncoastal barrier management.\n  The Federal Government actively encourages participation in the NFIP \nin order to minimize taxpayer costs in the event of a natural disaster. \nThe technical correction made by this amendment will rectify a \nlongstanding error and provide all eligible citizens with the \nopportunity to protect their homes with flood insurance.\n  I thank Senator Moynihan, Senator Chafee, the members of their \nrespective staffs, and especially the staff of the Senate Committee on \nEnvironmental and Public Works for working so diligently to ensure the \npassage of this important legislation.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3957\n\n  (Purpose: To direct the Secretary of the Interior to make technical \n corrections to a map relating to the coastal Barrier Resources System)\n\n  Mr. COHEN. Mr. President, I understand there is an amendment at the \ndesk offered by Senators Moynihan and D'Amato. I ask for its immediate \nconsideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Maine [Mr. Cohen], for Mr. Moynihan, for \n     himself, and Mr. D'Amato, proposes an amendment numbered \n     3957.\n\n  Mr. COHEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the end of the bill, add the following:\n\n     SEC. 2. CORRECTIONS TO COASTAL BARRIER RESOURCES MAP.\n\n       (a) In General.--Not later than 30 days after the date of \n     enactment of this Act, the Secretary of the Interior shall \n     make such corrections to the map described in subsection (b) \n     as are necessary--\n       (1) to move the eastern boundary of the excluded area \n     covering Ocean Beach, Seaview,\n\n[[Page S4689]]\n\n     Ocean Bay Park, and part of Point O'Woods to the western \n     boundary of the Sunken Forest Preserve; and\n       (2) to ensure that the depiction of areas as ``otherwise \n     protected areas'' does not include any area that is owned by \n     the Point O'Woods Association (a privately held corporation \n     under the laws of the State of New York).\n       (b) Map Described.--The map described in this subsection is \n     the map that is included in a set of maps entitled ``Coastal \n     Barrier Resources System'', dated October 24, 1990, that \n     relates to the unit of the Coastal Barrier Resources System \n     entitled ``Fire Island Unit NY-59P''.\n\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I am pleased that the Senate is \nconsidering H.R. 1836, legislation which authorizes the Secretary of \nthe Interior to acquire 98 acres, known as the Shadmoor parcel, in East \nHampton, NY, for inclusion in the Amagansett National Wildlife Refuge. \nIdentical companion legislation, S. 1422, was introduced by Senators \nMoynihan and D'Amato on November 17, 1995 and recently reported by the \nEnvironment and Public Works Committee.\n  This legislation will strengthen conservation of important fish and \nwildlife within the National Wildlife Refuge System by protecting \nvaluable coastal habitat for the federally endangered sandplain \ngerardia, 4 State-listed plant species, and over 70 species of birds, \nmammals, reptiles, and amphibians.\n  The Shadmoor parcel consists of maritime shrubland, freshwater \nwetlands, and rare maritime grassland. If acquired, this critical \ncoastal habitat would be managed from the existing refuge offices for \nthe Long Island National Wildlife Refuge Complex, with no additional \nstaff needed. While the estimated costs for acquisition of the Shadmore \nparcel range from $5 to $8 million, it is expected that the town of \nEast Hampton and the local chapter of the Nature Conservancy will \ncontribute a considerable portion of the project's total cost. I \napplaud the local community for their support for the Amagansett \nRefuge. This kind of partnership between the Fish and Wildlife Service, \nthe local government, and conservation groups is exactly what we need \nas we seek to stretch limited Federal dollars.\n  Mr. President, I also support the amendment to H.R. 1836 offered by \nSenators Moynihan and D'Amato. This amendment also addresses important \ncoastal resources on the barrier islands off the coast of New York. The \nMoynihan-D'Amato amendment simply adds a new section to H.R. 1836 \ndirecting the Secretary of the Interior to correct an error in the map \nrelating to the Fire Island Unit of the Coastal Barrier Resources \nSystem. This provision has already been included in legislation, H.R. \n2005, reported by the Environment and Public Works Committee last year \nand is identical to S. 1352, a bill introduced by Senators D'Amato and \nMoynihan.\n\n  This noncontroversial legislation would correct a mapping error by \nthe Department of the Interior. Certainly, the residents of Point \nO'Woods, NY--the area affected by this legislation--deserve to have \nthis matter set straight.\n  Let me take a moment to describe how we got here.\n  In 1982, Congress enacted the Coastal Barrier Resources Act to \npromote several important goals--conservation of fish and wildlife, \nminimization of loss of human life, and reduction in Federal \nexpenditures. How does this law accomplish all of this? It's simple. \nThe Coastal Barrier Resources Act prohibits most Federal Expenditures \nand financial assistance within undeveloped coastal barriers that are \ndesignated as units of the Coastal Barrier Resources System.\n  Mr. President, the Coastal Barrier Resources Act makes perfect fiscal \nand environmental sense. It gets the Federal Government out of the \nexpensive business of subsidizing development of ecologically sensitive \nand dangerous coastal areas. In fact, between 1982 and 1990, savings \nassociated with the Coastal Barrier Resources Act were estimated by the \nDepartment of the Interior at over $830 million.\n  With passage of the Coastal Barrier Improvement Act of 1990, Congress \ndoubled the size of the Coastal Barrier Resources System, adding areas \nalong the coast of the Atlantic Ocean and the gulf of Mexico, the \nbeaches of Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands, and the shores of the \nGreat Lakes. The 1990 law also established a new category of coastal \nbarriers designated as ``otherwise protected areas.'' These encompass \nundeveloped coastal barriers with the boundaries of areas that are \nowned and managed for conservation purposes. Thus, otherwise protected \nareas include open spaces such as parklands, sanctuaries, and forest \npreserves. Under the 1990 law, sale of new Federal flood insurance is \nprohibited within otherwise protected areas, with one exception. \nFederal flood insurance can be obtained for structures that are used in \na manner that is consistent with the purpose for which the area is \nprotected.\n\n  Both the Coastal Barrier Resources Act and the 1990 act to expand the \nCoastal Barrier Resources System refer to a series of maps, approved by \nCongress and maintained by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, that \ndepict the boundaries of the system units and the otherwise protected \nareas. Unfortunately, the map of the Fire Island Unit that was added in \n1990 erroneously depicts a private area owned by the Point O'Woods \nAssociation as part of an otherwise protected area, known as the Sunken \nForest Preserve. To correct this mistake, the Department of the \nInterior has recommended that the Point O'Woods property be removed \nfrom within the boundary depicted on the map for Fire Island Unit NY-\n59P. And, the Moynihan-D'Amato amendment does just that.\n  Mr. President, this legislation directs the Secretary of the Interior \nto correct the error on the map relating to the Fire Island Unit of the \nCoastal Barrier Resources System by modifying the boundary of the \notherwise protected area to exclude the Point O'Woods Association's \nproperty. As I mentioned, a bill to make this correction was introduced \nby Senator D'Amato and Senator Moynihan earlier this Congress and \nreported by the Environment and Public Works Committee.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this amendment. It is important that \nthe Congress modify the maps of Coastal Barrier Resources System units \nand otherwise protected areas when true mapping errors are identified. \nThat is why we enacted a technical corrections bill last Congress, \nPublic Law 103-461, and why I support this legislation. In each case, \nchanges to the boundaries depicted on the Coastal Barrier Resources \nSystem maps were necessary because the areas in question did not \nqualify as undeveloped coastal barriers or as otherwise protected areas \nat the time that they were included in the system by Congress. And, in \neach case, the Department of the Interior supported making technical \nchanges to the maps.\n  Mr. President, the integrity of the Coastal Barrier Resources \nSystem--a system that continues to save American taxpayers money--\ndepends on maintenance of strict standards. Of course there are plenty \nof landowners who would prefer not to be included in the Coastal \nBarrier Resources System. But, it would undermine the purposes of the \nCoastal Barrier Resources Act if Congress were to start removing areas \nthat did qualify as undeveloped coastal barriers when they were \nincluded in the system in 1982 or 1990. Not only that, but it would be \npatently unfair to property owners who are within the Coastal Barrier \nResources System if Congress started to bend the rules for some but not \nfor others.\n  I would like to thank the Senators from New York for working closely \nwith the committee on this legislation authorizing the Secretary of the \nInterior to acquire an area of critical coastal habitat and making a \nneeded correction in the Coastal Barrier Resources System. H.R. 1836 \ndeserves enactment without delay.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that two letters from the \nDepartment of the Interior in support of the provisions included in the \nMoynihan-D'Amato amendment be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letters were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                       Department of the Interior,\n\n\n                                    Fish and Wildlife Service,\n\n                                                   Washington, DC.\n     Hon. John H. Chafee,\n     Chairman, Committee on Environment and Public Works, U.S. \n         Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: Thank you for your January 26, 1996, \n     request for the Department of the Interior's position \n     regarding H.R. 2005, a bill proposing to make technical \n     corrections to the Coastal Barrier Resources System.\n\n[[Page S4690]]\n\n       Bill H.R. 2005 proposes to make technical corrections to \n     the area identified as NY-59P which is part of the Fire \n     Island National Seashore and is mapped as an ``otherwise \n     protected area'' within the Coastal Barrier Resources System. \n     This area was added to the System as a result of the Coastal \n     Barrier Improvement Act in 1990.\n       ``Otherwise protected areas'' are defined by the Coastal \n     Barrier Resources Act as coastal barriers which are \n     ``included within the boundaries of an area established under \n     Federal, State, or local law, or held by a qualified \n     organization as defined in Section 170(h)(3) of the Internal \n     Revenue Code of 1954, primarily for wildlife refuge, \n     sanctuary, recreational, or natural resource conservation \n     purposes.'' Congress with passage of the 1990 legislation, \n     prohibited the sale of Federal flood insurance within \n     ``otherwise protected areas.''\n       Bill H.R. 2005 will modify the area currently excluded from \n     NY-59P which includes the subdivisions of Ocean Beach, \n     Seaview, Ocean Bay Park and a part of Point O'Woods by \n     extending this excluded area to the western boundary of the \n     Sunken Forest Preserve; thus, removing a part of NY-59P from \n     the System. Bill H.R. 2005 also proposes ``to ensure that the \n     depiction of areas as ``otherwise protected areas'' does not \n     include any area that is owned by the Point O'Woods \n     Association (a privately held corporation under the laws of \n     the State of New York).''\n       The Point O'Woods Association property is not a part of the \n     Fire Island National Seashore. Therefore, the Service \n     recommends that the boundary of NY-59P be modified to remove \n     the Point O'Woods property from within the boundary of NY-\n     59P.\n       After careful consideration, we have determined that this \n     change is consistent with the ``technical corrections'' that \n     were approved by Congress with passage of the recent Public \n     Law 103-461, November 2, 1994, using the delineation criteria \n     formerly developed by the Department and later approved by \n     Congress. Therefore, the area should not remain in the System \n     and does require ``correction.''\n       The Department supports passage of H.R. 2005.\n       We appreciate the opportunity to provide you with this \n     information. If you have any questions, please contact the \n     Office of Legislative Services at (202) 208-5403.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                     ------ ------\n     Director.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                       Department of the Interior,\n\n\n                                        National Park Service,\n\n                                     Patchogue, NY, June 27, 1995.\n     Robert Kingsbury,\n     President, Point O'Woods Association, Point O'Woods, NY.\n     Re Coastal Barrier Resources System.\n       Dear Mr. Kingsbury: I support your community's efforts to \n     make the appropriate technical corrections to the Coastal \n     Barrier Resources Systems map of Fire Island that was adopted \n     by Congress in 1990. The corrected map will resolve the \n     development inequities resulting from the flood insurance \n     restrictions placed upon the eastern portion of Point O'Woods \n     in its designation as an ``otherwise protected area'', under \n     the Coastal Barrier Resources Act.\n       As you are aware, the legislation establishing the Fire \n     Island National Seashore (Public Law 88-587, 1964) \n     contemplates that the existing communities on Fire Island \n     would continue to be available for human habitation and \n     development, and prohibited, with minor exceptions, the \n     Secretary of the Interior from acquiring land within those \n     communities.\n       The mapping done in 1990 excluded from ``otherwise \n     protected area'' status the other 16 communities on Fire \n     Island, while designating the eastern part of Point O'Woods \n     as an ``otherwise protected area''. Although located within \n     the park's boundary, these communities are comprised of \n     privately held properties and are, therefore, not considered \n     by the park service to be ``inholdings''. As such, the \n     community of Point O'Woods should not be designated as an \n     ``otherwise protected area''. Additionally, Point O'Woods \n     does not fit within the definition of ``undeveloped coastal \n     barrier'', in that there are approximately 150 man-made \n     structures in this 160-acre community.\n       It was an error that should be corrected, in order to grant \n     the Point O'Woods community the same development rights as \n     every other existing community on Fire Island, as defined in \n     the Seashore's Federal Zoning Standards (36 C.F.R. Part 28). \n     In other words, the continued use of relocated residences \n     into areas within the community, and away from high erosional \n     hazards is consistent with Fire Island National Seashore \n     policy. An amended map would enable more effective coastal \n     barrier management in the future. If you have any questions, \n     or wish to discuss this further, feel free to call me at \n     (516) 289-4810.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                    Jack Hauptman,\n                                                   Superintendent.\n\n  Mr. COHEN.

Mr. President, last Sunday I had occasion to address a \nmemorial service that was held for Senator Muskie at Bates College in \nMaine to comment about his life in the U.S. Senate and beyond when he \nserved as Secretary of State. It was a very moving testimonial that \nhighlighted his enormous accomplishments during a career of public \nservice, including his time as Governor of Maine and his service here \nin the Senate and as Secretary of State.\n  Last week, at about this time, I also had occasion to stand on the \nSenate floor and offer my condolences and a brief eulogy to Gayle Cory, \na woman who had served Senator Muskie for some 21 years as a very \ntrusted and loyal aide and then went on to serve his successor, Senator \nMitchell, before she became head of the Senate post office.\n  It seems, and I recall this so very well, when Vaclav Havel addressed \na joint meeting of Congress, he made a statement about events that were \ntaking place in the world. He said, ``Things have been happening so \nrapidly that we have little time to be astonished.'' That quote keeps \ncoming back to me in terms of so many tragedies that occur in so rapid \na period of time that we have very little time to grieve.\n  When I first came here, I was joined by my colleague from Wyoming, Al \nSimpson. He told a story during one of our initial meetings about the \ntime that he was advised that a very close friend of his had died. He \nsat down and penned a very personal letter to the wife of his close \nfriend saying what an extraordinary human being he was and talking \nabout some of the great times that they had together, and really \nexpressing a wellspring of feeling about his relationship with that \nfriend.\n\n  He sent the letter off in the mail, and lo and behold, he was advised \nthat the report was a mistake, that his friend actually had not died. \nHe was desperate to call the wife of the friend and say, ``Please don't \nopen the letter.'' The essence of the story was, from Senator Simpson \nat least, why do we wait so long, why do we wait so long to tell \nsomeone we love them? Why do we wait until it is too late? Why do we \nwait until they die to express all the eulogies?\n  This statement of Al Simpson came to mind as I was reading a column \nby William Raspberry, dated April 15. I am going to read just a portion \nof it. Raspberry cites an article he had read, actually a letter to the \neditor of USA Today written by a man named Barry Harris of Montgomery, \nAL.\n  He said:\n\n       ``It's nice to see the tributes to the work of the late \n     Commerce Secretary Ron Brown and all those who perished in \n     the tragic events of a few days ago,'' he wrote. ``But I'm \n     wondering why we didn't see such reporting before their \n     untimely deaths.\n       ``It seems that the media spend so much time on criticism \n     of public servants that there's little time or space to \n     comment on their accomplishments on behalf of our country. \n     That is a disservice which only contributes to the climate of \n     governmental cynicism perpetrated by primarily selfish \n     forces.''\n\n  Indeed, I asked myself the same question. Why do we focus on all of \nthe negative aspects of those who are willing to serve the public and \nthen heap praise upon their caskets like so many flowers? We tend to \njudge our colleagues, and those who serve in the executive branch, on \nsurface qualities. We talk about the quality of their clothes, the cars \nthey may drive, their mannerisms, all the superficial aspects of an \nindividual, without really touching upon the heart and soul of that \nindividual.\n  Washington can be a very cruel city. I recall something from the very \nfirst book I ever read about Washington, Allen Drury's novel ``Advise \nand Consent,'' which came out in the late 1950's.\n  It struck me, as I recall the imagery created by Drury's wonderful \npen. He said:\n\n       They come, they stay, they make their mark, writing big or \n     little on their times, in that strange, fantastic, \n     fascinating land in which there are few absolute wrongs or \n     absolute rights, few all-blacks or all-whites, few dead-\n     certain positives that won't be changed tomorrow; their \n     wonderful, mixed-up, blundering, stumbling, hopeful land in \n     which evil men do good things and good men do evil in a way \n     of life and government so complex and delicately balanced \n     that only Americans can understand it and often they are \n     baffled.\n\n  That is a wonderful description of this city, a very tough and cruel \ncity. As Vincent Foster, who committed suicide a few years ago, \nreminded us, many times Washington politics is such a blood sport.\n  Mr. President, I say that there is a general decline in civility and \ncommon decency, not only in politics, but in many aspects of our lives \ntoday. I do not intend to take the time to try to catalog the words, \nthe deeds that pollute our conscious moments with trash and filth and \nviolence.\n  I say this by way of a preface to a few comments I will make about \nRon Brown who was a close friend. It has been nearly a month now since \nhe and more than 30 people perished in that plane that was flying into \nCroatia to try to help rebuild and reconstruct that tortured land.\n  We have, I think, forgotten the significance of what he meant to so \nmany of us, what an extraordinary human being he was, what a life-\nenhancing spirit he possessed that he bestowed on anyone he came into \ncontact with.\n  I recently watched a program with my wife of a speech that he gave \nthat took place on February 15 at Howard University. He spoke to what \nappeared to be an entirely black audience. He did not speak of hate or \nanger. He talked about hope and strength and courage, the will to \novercome adversity, to know in advance that because racism is not a \ndead thing of the past, but alive and flourishing in so many overt and \nsubtle ways, that those students would have to be twice as good as \ntheir competitors in order to win--twice as good--because we still hold \non to the fiction that America has progressed to the point that society \nis race neutral, that it is colorblind.\n\n  The fact is, Mr. President, that is a fiction. I picked up the \nWashington Post today, and I saw an item about a young woman who had \nmoved into the home of her dreams in Philadelphia. She had to abandon \nthat hope, which has turned into a nightmare, because she has received \nnot only threats to her own safety, but threats to kill her two \ndaughters. So she has given up the dream.\n  A few weeks ago I saw in the Washington Post a story about a man in \nChicago, a black man, who could not and would not drive a fancy car, a \ncolorful car, or he would not dare to wear his beret because the moment \nhe put the beret on or drove a red car, or something that was a sporty \ncar, he was sure to be stopped and harassed. So he took the beret off, \nand he drove a plain, gray, dull ordinary-looking car with the hope \nthat he would not be harassed by the local police officials.\n  These are not extraordinary events. They happen every day, day in and \nday out, for those who do not happen to enjoy the benefit of being \nwhite in our society.\n  I have been reading Colin Powell's work. He is someone who is looked \nupon with great admiration in this country. Many of us hope that he \nwill reconsider his announced decision not to become involved in \npolitics, at least for the foreseeable future. But in Powell's book \n``My American Journey,'' he talks about the time when he was in high \nschool and serving in ROTC. He went down to Fort Bragg in North \nCarolina. At the end of his 6 weeks--he said:\n\n       . . . we fell out on the parade ground for presentation of \n     honors. We were judged on course grades, rifle range scores, \n     physical fitness, and demonstrated leadership. I was named \n     ``Best Cadet, Company D.'' These are the words engraved on \n     the desk set that was presented to me that day and that I \n     still treasure. A student from Cornell, Adin B. Capron, was \n     selected Best Cadet for the entire encampment. I came in \n     second in that category.\n       I was feeling marvelous about my honor. And then, the night \n     before we left, as we were turning in our gear, a white \n     supply sergeant took me aside. ``You want to know why you \n     didn't get best cadet in camp?'' he said. I had not given it \n     a thought. ``You think these Southern ROTC instructors are \n     going to go back to their colleges and say the best kid here \n     was a Negro?'' I was stunned more than angered by what he \n     said. I came from a melting-pot community. I did\n\n[[Page S4692]]\n\n     not want to believe that my worth could be diminished by the \n     color of my skin. Wasn't it possible that Cadet Capron was \n     simply better than Cadet Powell?\n\n  Then he goes on to talk about his experience upon leaving Fort Bragg, \nabout not being able to go to the same church and sit in the same pew \nwith his white colleagues, not being able to go into the same bathrooms \nin order to relieve himself on the way back, not being able to sit at \nthe same counter to enjoy a meal, notwithstanding the fact that he \nmight have to fight and die in the same trenches as his white \ncolleagues.\n  I want to conclude my comments about Colin Powell with a reference \nthat he made and that I think applies to what I am talking about as far \nas Ron Brown is concerned.\n  He said:\n\n       Racism was still relatively new to me, and I had to find a \n     way to cope psychologically. I began by identifying my \n     priorities. I wanted, above all, to succeed at my Army \n     career. I did not intend to give way to self-destructive \n     rage, no matter how provoked. If people in the South insisted \n     on living by crazy rules, then I would play the hand dealt me \n     for now. If I was to be confined to one end of the playing \n     field, then I was going to be a star on that part of the \n     field. Nothing that happened off-post, none of the \n     indignities, none of the injustices, was going to inhibit my \n     performance. I was not going to let myself become emotionally \n     crippled because I could not play on the whole field. I did \n     not feel inferior, and I was not going to let anybody make me \n     believe I was. I was not going to allow someone else's \n     feelings about me to become my feelings about myself. Racism \n     was not just a black problem. It was America's problem. And \n     until the country solved it, I was not going to let bigotry \n     make me a victim instead of a full human being. I \n     occasionally felt hurt; I felt anger; but most of all I felt \n     challenged, I'll show you!\n\n  That is precisely what Ron Brown's life was all about. It is what he \ndid his entire life--take any portion of the field and be the best in \nthat field, be twice as good as the competition. He did it with grace \nand humor and a great sense of humanity.\n  I recall when he was named to be the chairman of the DNC. I see my \ncolleague from Arkansas who is here. When he was first proposed to be \nchairman of the Democratic National Committee, there were some people \nwho worried about that. ``Wait a minute. We're going to name a black \nman to be chairman of the Democratic National Committee? What's going \nto happen to our white base in the South?'' But Ron Brown built \nbridges. There are some people in our country who want to put up walls \naround the country. Ron Brown's life was dedicated to seeking the best \nin people and not exploiting the worst. He possessed such an abundance \nof humanity that he took the time to read to Lee Atwater. When Lee \nAtwater was dying, it was Ron Brown who went beside his bed and read to \nhim. How many of us have such a generosity of spirit? How many of us, \nday in and day out, would be capable of going to the other side, to \npeople that we argue and debate with, challenge and fight with over \npolitical issues and in their time of torment and need take the time to \nread to someone who is dying?\n\n  After all that he did to get Bill Clinton elected as President, I \nthink he should have been given any choice of any Cabinet position, not \nbecause he was black but because he was the best. It did not happen. He \nwas offered the position of Secretary of Commerce. He took what was \noffered to him and he did what? He did exactly what Colin Powell and so \nmany other black Americans have done and had to do throughout history. \nHe became the best on that portion of the field that he was allowed to \nplay on.\n  Mr. President, I know there are some who would like to abolish the \nCommerce Department as a symbol of our need to reduce the size of \nGovernment in Washington. I could perhaps understand it if Ron Brown \nwere antibusiness. There might be some merit to that. But he was one of \nthe most probusiness Secretaries of Commerce we have ever had. I do not \nrecall our effort to dismantle the Department of Commerce when \nPresident Nixon was in office, President Ford, President Reagan, or \nPresident Bush. But apparently there is a need to dismantle some \noffices and agencies, and that is one we settle on.\n  I do not understand it, but let me just say that I think that Ron \nBrown will be remembered as one of the finest Secretaries of Commerce \nwe ever had. He was out there the day that he died promoting business \non behalf of the United States of America.\n  I conclude my remarks with a quote taken from Justice Oliver Wendell \nHolmes Jr., something I think applies to Ron Brown:\n\n       Through our great good fortune, in our youth our hearts \n     were touched with fire. It was given to us to learn at the \n     outset that life is a profound and passionate thing. While we \n     are permitted to scorn nothing but indifference and do not \n     pretend to undervalue the worldly rewards of ambition, we \n     have seen with our own eyes, beyond and above the gold \n     fields, the snowy heights of honor, and it is for us to bear \n     the report to those who come after us. But, above all, we \n     have learned that whether a man accepts from Fortune her \n     spade, and will look downward and dig, or from Aspiration her \n     axe and cord, and will scale the ice, the one and only \n     success, which it is his to command is to bring to his work a \n     mighty heart.\n\n  Ron Brown in whatever capacity--as a lawyer, lobbyist, DNC chairman, \nSecretary of Commerce--brought to his work a mighty heart. While there \nare those in our society who would like to point to all the negatives, \npoint to all the deficiencies or character flaws, or the superficial \nqualities, there are those of us here who believe that Ron Brown's \nhumanity, his courage, his determination to succeed on that portion of \nthe field that he was allowed to play on, brought to his work a mighty \nheart. I for one am going to miss him deeply.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, while the Senator from Maine is still on \nthe floor, let me say that his magnificent accolade to our departed \nbrother, Ron Brown, is one of the reasons so many of us are very sad \nthat he has chosen to leave the Senate. Those remarks were eloquent. I \nhope they were heard by everybody in the Senate on this slow, Friday \nafternoon.\n  Senator Cohen has always been in the forefront of issues that really \nmatter, where partisan politics do not have any role. He has, without \nfail, been a giant in this body. Those remarks prove conclusively that \na lot of people are still in this business because public service is a \nnoble calling.\n  As I say, I do not know of anybody on either side of the aisle that \nhas not expressed profound regret at Senator Cohen's decision to retire \nat the end of this year. He alluded to the press and how they can very \nseldom find anything nice to say about a public servant until after \nthey die or retire. Jim Fallows discusses this phenomenon in his book, \ntitled ``Breaking the News: How the Media Undermine American \nDemocracy.'' It is a magnificent book, and I recommend it. Fallows has \nmade a couple of speeches in which he talks about this problem. For \nexample, in the weeks before Ron Brown died, the New York Times \neditorial page was castigating him and a couple days after he died he \nwas praised on that same editorial page.\n  I talked to a Senator yesterday afternoon who decided in 1994 not to \nrun again. He said the major newspaper in his State had never said a \nkind word about him that he could remember until he announced his \nretirement. He said he then got more accolades over the next 6 months \nthen he had had in his entire public career.\n  I suppose you could attribute that to human nature. It is a natural \nthing. It would be nice and it would be gratifying if there was some \nrecognition for a few people who labor in the vineyards year after year \nbecause they believe in this democracy and they believe in our \npolitical system and they want to operate within it, not like the \nFreemen of Montana. It would be very helpful if somebody said something \nnice.\n  Most of us get enough accolades to keep our ego fueled. But I just \nwant to again say, Mr. President, Senator Cohen and I have teamed up on \nseveral causes since we both have been here together. I will miss him \ngreatly. One of the reasons is because of the statesmanship he \ndemonstrated this afternoon.\n  Mr. President, I think that I can say what I want to say about the \ngas tax within 10 minutes, but rather than interrupt my remarks, let me \nask unanimous consent I be permitted to proceed for such time as I may \nuse.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/05/03/senate-section/article/S4691-1", "month": "05", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "03", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4692-S4694]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              THE GAS TAX\n\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, if we do not hurry up and get the \nPresidential race over with, I do not know\n\n[[Page S4693]]\n\nwhat will happen in this country. How Senator Dole has voted on the gas \ntax in the past is not relevant to me. What kind of a country my \nchildren and grandchildren inherit is.\n  I happen to strongly disagree with Senator Dole on repealing the 4.3-\ncent gasoline tax that we put on--not to build highways but to balance \nthe budget--that fateful August day in 1993. That particular deficit \nreduction package, in my opinion, is still the hallmark of the Clinton \nadministration, the most responsible thing the President has done, the \nmost courageous thing he has done. When we open our mail each day a \ncertain portion of it is hate mail. Some of it is just plain critical. \nSome of it is very complimentary. When you get to the hate mail it is \nalways, ``Why don't you people screw up your nerve and make those \ncourageous decisions?''\n  I have said on the floor of the Senate many times the definition of a \ncourageous decision is an unpopular one. The definition of a courageous \nvote is an unpopular vote. If it were popular, it would not be \ncourageous. How many times do you see people walk down this aisle and \nvote, and they look to see how it is going, and it is 50 to 5 or 50 to \n10, yeas versus nays, 9 times out of 10, nobody wants to be caught out \nthere with 5 Senators, so they vote yea, too.\n  In 1993, every Republican Senator voted against that bill, and \nperhaps this clamor to repeal the gas tax which was part of the deficit \nreduction package, maybe the Republicans would like to find some \njustification for the fact that every single one of them voted no on a \nvery courageous deficit reduction package which today, 1996, will give \nus a $144 billion deficit this year. Before we passed that bill in \n1993, we were facing a $290 billion deficit for this year.\n  I was proud of that vote in 1993. I am proud of it now. I do not \nintend to take the easy political way out by voting for the repeal of \nthe 4.3-cent gasoline tax. That might gain you applause for about 10 \nminutes back home, but nobody, so far, has said how we are going to \nmake up this $3 billion-plus in revenue we lose with the repeal of this \ngas tax. Now, you talk about an easy, popular vote, here is one. You \nvote to cut that gas tax for the rest of the year, it comes to about $3 \nbillion, and you do not have to figure out where you are going to get \nthe $3 billion. What an easy vote that would be.\n\n  I saw in the paper this morning where the House and Senate Armed \nServices Committees have voted to increase defense spending in 1997 by \nover $12 billion. Why? Make no bones about it. So they can portray \nPresident Clinton as weak on defense. But the question ought to be, \n``Weak against whom?'' Who is the enemy that we are going to spend $270 \nbillion next year to defend against? The Soviet Union is gone. Russia \nis a basket case. The Chinese do not even have antiaircraft missiles on \ntheir ships, such ships as they have. That $270 billion, in 1997, will \nbe the equivalent of the amount that our 10 most likely enemies, \ncombined, will spend. It is twice as much as the 5 most likely enemies \nwill spend, including China and Russia.\n  Mr. President, $12 billion is a lot of money to prove that the \nPresident is weak on defense. Why do we not just get on the floor and \nsay, ``You are right, the President is weak on defense; now do not \nspend the $12 billion\"? Or you might say, ``Please tell us the enemy \nthat you are proposing to spend this $12 billion to defend against.''\n  Now, I do not normally read Charles Krauthammer in the Post, but I \nread it this morning because it dealt with this gasoline tax, and it \nwas a beautiful article. He hit the nail right on the head. Everybody \nis looking for a scapegoat. In my 22 years in the Senate, when somebody \nmade a terrible mistake in judgment, or somebody was just plain \nnegligent, if the incident had any political appeal, somebody else \ncould always be counted on to call for a hearing. Congress has to think \nabout this. We have now spent over $30 million on Whitewater, and \ncounting, and the American people are still wondering what it is about.\n  Now there is going to be a hearing in the House about the fact that \nthe President did not take an affirmative or a negative position on \nIran furnishing arms to the Bosnians. I doubt very seriously if there \nwas anybody in the U.S. Senate that did not know it was going on. But \nit is only now after the fact that we have to have a hearing. We have \nto investigate this. Why does everybody want to investigate everything? \nBecause that is where the television cameras come. If you hold a \nhearing in your committee and bring the television cameras in and turn \nthose red lights on, they will keep going forever if they can.\n  You do not have to be a rocket scientist to know why gas prices are \nup. They are up because, under the Clean Air Act, we demanded \nreformulated gasoline so the air would be cleaner, and that costs about \na nickel a gallon. We pay it here in Washington, but not in Little Rock \nbecause our air was not dirty enough to require us to use reformulated \ngasoline. What else? The average driver in this country is driving \n2,000 miles more per year per car than they did 10 years ago. We have a \nlot of younger drivers being added to the driver rolls. We are driving \nbigger cars and more trucks. If you are a yuppie, you have to have a \nsport utility vehicle. I do not know what those suckers get per mile \nper gallon, but I know one thing--if you are in the in-crowd, you sure \nbetter have a Blazer, or an Explorer or a Cherokee. We took all the \nspeed limits off. Montana does not even have a speed limit.\n  What else? We had a harsh winter, and we diverted so much of our oil \nto heating oil instead of gasoline. So our stocks of gasoline were low.\n  What else? Everybody thought we were going to let Iraq start selling \noil on the world markets.\n  Those are seven reasons the price of gasoline has gone up. As Charles \nKrauthammer so eloquently said in his column this morning, ``Why has \nall this happened? How about a wild guess? Because supply is down and \ndemand is up.''\n  How long will this go on? Who knows? The energy information office \nsays that prices will start down by August. They are down 4 cents where \nI buy gasoline now from where they were 2 weeks ago. But this is a \nPresidential year. You have to get what you can when you can get it.\n  My good friend, the junior Senator from Louisiana, John Breaux, said \nthat to cut the gasoline tax--that 4.3 cents per gallon--off and think \nthat you are going to do something to relieve this problem is like \nspitting in the ocean and hoping to make it rise.\n  Mr. President, if we do this, if this is brought to the floor of the \nSenate, Senator Bryan of Nevada and I are going to offer an amendment \nto raise what we call the CAFE standards. The CAFE standards--for the \nuninitiated who do not serve on the Energy Committee--are the average \nmiles per gallon that we require the automobile makers to meet. Right \nnow, we have CAFE standards that have given us a 21-mile-per-gallon \naverage of all of our vehicles.\n  In 1973, when the Arab oil embargo hit, the average car in America \ngot 13 miles per gallon. With Scoop Jackson, who was a great Senator \nfrom Washington and chairman of the Energy Committee, we passed the \nCAFE standards and said to the automobile industry that they have to \nprovide cars that do better. They have to be more fuel efficient. They \nassured us that they were going to go broke. Every time we ask them to \ndo something, we are assured that they are going to go broke. But that \ndid not influence us much. That is when they thought the little \nJapanese cars were funny looking and the American people would never \nbuy them. We probably saved their lives by imposing the CAFE standards \non them. In any event, it was 13 miles per gallon. In 1990, we achieved \n21 miles per gallon, and there it stands today. We have not improved \nour mileage per gallon one iota in 6 years.\n  And so Senator Bryan and I will offer an amendment if this gas tax \nrepeal is debated. We will say forget Presidential politics, forget the \ngrandstanding. Let us do something meaningful. Let us raise the fuel \nefficiency of all the vehicles in this country. That will actually do \nsomething about saving energy.\n  The U.S. Public Interest Research Group says that if we raised the \nCAFE standards, which are about 27.5 miles per gallon now for \nautomobiles, a little less than that for trucks, to 45 miles per \ngallon--which could be done--for automobiles, and 34 miles per gallon \nfor small trucks, in 10 years' time we would save $65 billion.\n\n[[Page S4694]]\n\n  You think of what that would do to our trade deficit. Everybody knows \nthat the oil we import is the biggest single contributor to our trade \ndeficit and our balance of payments problems. But it is very difficult \nto pass a CAFE standard because that inconveniences people. It is true, \noil company profits were really excessive the first quarter, and the \noil companies are taking advantage of these price increases because the \ndemand is high and the supply is low. But is that not the good old \nAmerican system? Is not supply and demand at the very heart of \ncapitalism?\n  So, Mr. President, you can never get it perfect. The President wants \nthe cattlemen to get a better shake, and I understand that. This \nmorning I looked at the commodity prices. It is absolutely incredible. \nWheat is almost $6 a bushel, soybeans $8 a bushel, corn $4.50 a bushel. \nAnd you know what this body did. It voted to do away with the law that \nmade those prices possible and said we are going to pass this freedom-\nto-farm bill. You can get 85 cents a pound for cotton, $6 for wheat, \n$4.50 for corn, and we will give you a big fat check on top of that. It \nis going to cost $21 billion more over the next 7 years.\n  It is the silliest thing this body has ever done. Even the farmers \ndid not want it. So the cattlemen are having to pay these exorbitant \nprices for grain, and the supply of cattle is high. You can sell oil \nout of the strategic petroleum reserve. That is sort of like spitting \nin the ocean, too. And you can repeal the 4.3-cent-a-gallon tax, which \nis worth $27 a year to the average car owner in this country, and say \nthe deficit will be up $3 billion more this year, and if we allow it to \nstay, it will be up by several billion more in the next 2 years.\n  Everybody wants to vote for the easy, popular things, and if it \nraises the deficit, so be it. That is just something we talk about. \nWell, Mr. President, I do not know that anybody wants to filibuster a \nproposal to repeal that 4.3-cent gas tax, but I hope it will not come \nup. If it does, I hope the debate will be extended. It would be the \nheight of folly.\n  Mr. President, the minority leader will be here momentarily, I \nassume. I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Lott). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The Democratic leader is recognized.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/05/03/senate-section/article/S4692-1", "month": "05", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "03", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4694]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          HIGH GASOLINE PRICES\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, let me thank the distinguished Senator \nfrom Arkansas for an extraordinarily strong statement with regard to \ngas prices and gas taxes. I do not know that anyone has said it more \neloquently and passionately and more compellingly than has the senior \nSenator from Arkansas. There are, indeed, a number of things we can do \nif we are serious about addressing high gasoline prices.\n  The Senator from Arkansas has mentioned again yet another opportunity \nfor us to reduce prices, and that is to find ways with which to make \ngasoline-powered automobiles, all kinds of vehicles, more efficient. By \nproviding an increase in the CAFE standards, we can, indeed, make \ngasoline-powered vehicles a lot more efficient--not just gasoline \nvehicles, but diesel-powered vehicles and all transportation more \nefficient.\n\n  He has taken, as well as the Senator from Nevada, a very strong \nleadership position in making that happen. So whether or not we take \nthat approach and whether or not we give people across this country the \nassurance that any tax reduction goes into their pocket, whether we \ntake other approaches, we will have the opportunity to debate it. But I \nthink there is a clear, clear choice here. We can bail out the oil \ncompanies, as some have suggested, or we can help consumers and \ntaxpayers. If we really want to help consumers and taxpayers, we are \ngoing to make vehicles more efficient and we are going to ensure that \nwhatever relief we offer goes in the pockets of consumers, and not into \nthe pockets of the oil companies.\n  So we will have that opportunity perhaps as early as next week. I \nhope next week we can work out an arrangement that will allow us to \naddress the real issue here, and that is, how can we address the \neconomic stagnation that so many working families are feeling. Working \nfamilies are not getting their share of the benefit of the economy in \npart because they are not seeing increases in wages, in part because \nthey are not getting the kind of health benefits they deserve, in part \nbecause they do not have the pension security that they so badly need. \nAnd so we will have an opportunity to address those issues in the \ncoming days and hopefully resolve them successfully.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/05/03/senate-section/article/S4694-1", "month": "05", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "03", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4694-S4695]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             SENATE ISSUES\n\n\n                            Livestock Prices\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I come to the floor to make a couple of \nremarks. It was not my intention to come back to the floor, having \nspoken a little bit earlier today, but I wish to make three points. The \nfirst has to do with the issue raised by the distinguished majority \nleader about livestock prices. He mentioned that the market is \nresponding, and I am very hopeful that it will continue to respond to \nthe actions taken this week.\n  There is no one more responsible for the fact that those actions have \nbeen extraordinarily beneficial to cattle producers across this country \nthan the President himself. The President and I discussed, as he did \nwith other Senators, the possibility of holding a livestock meeting \nlast weekend. We held that meeting Tuesday afternoon, and as early as \nWednesday morning the livestock markets began to respond. They \nresponded Wednesday, they responded Thursday, and now they have \nresponded again today. We have seen about a 12- to 14-percent increase \nin livestock prices in the futures markets directly as a result of the \nactions taken by the White House, by this President on Tuesday \nafternoon.\n  The President is limited, of course, in the actions he can take \nunilaterally, but he has, in my view, pulled out virtually every stop \nto ensure that those prices go up. He is going to do all he can within \nhis power and authority, both internationally and domestically. So I \napplaud him for the actions he has taken.\n  Hopefully, we will have the opportunity here on the Senate floor to \nprovide him with additional authority. There is $300 million sitting \nwithout the prospect of any utilization this year in the Export \nEnhancement Program. That money could be directed toward livestock and \nother markets abroad. It will take legislative authority, and we will \nprovide our colleagues with an opportunity to vote on that Export \nEnhancement Program in the future.\n  Clearly, we have to respond. Prices in real terms are as low as they \nwere in the 1930's, and the more we do, the more action we can take \nboth in the short and the long terms, the more we can send as clear a \nmessage to the markets as possible that we want to work with those in \nthe livestock industry to ensure a stable price, to ensure longer term \nviability, to ensure that we do not find ourselves in a disaster \nsituation in the weeks and months ahead if we can avoid it.\n  So I applaud the President in his actions on Tuesday. It was he and \nthe Secretary of Agriculture, of course, who formed the livestock \nconcentration commission that, in our view, could also be very \nbeneficial in providing some guidance on how we deal with those markets \nmore effectively. When three corporations control more than 80 percent \nof the livestock market, we should not be surprised that prices are as \nvolatile and certainly as difficult to bear for thousands of producers \nacross the country as they are today.\n  So we will wait with some confidence that the commission will make \nrecommendations that also could be very beneficial, beginning in early \nJune.\n\n\n                            The Minimum Wage\n\n  The second point I want to raise this afternoon has to do with the \nprocedural situation we face yet again on the Senate floor. We will be \ntaking up a bill that I think will probably enjoy pretty broad support. \nFrankly, I am disappointed once again that the so-called parliamentary \ntrees have been filled in an effort to preclude Senators from offering \nother amendments.\n\n[[Page S4695]]\n\n  I have never seen so many of my Republican colleagues so willing to \nact like Members of the House as I have in the last couple of weeks. If \nthey want to be in the House of Representatives, perhaps they should \nrun for the House of Representatives. In the House of Representatives \nof course we have limited opportunities to offer amendments, limited \nopportunities to debate important issues, rules that constrain \nindividual Members. But that has never been the purpose of the U.S. \nSenate. Here in the U.S. Senate we have always had the opportunity to \nbring up amendments, to have good debates on important issues, \nregardless of whether committees have reported out that specific \nlegislation. Yet, over the last several weeks, the majority has \nprecluded amendments from the minority in an effort to thwart those of \nus who want to bring to the floor an up-or-down vote on the minimum \nwage.\n  We may be denied that vote temporarily. The majority can continue to \ndelay that vote. But ultimately we will have a vote on minimum wage, \nwhether it is this week or next week or the week after or the week \nafter that. Sooner or later the Senate must come to the realization \nthat we cannot for all perpetuity and for the rest of this session of \nCongress, deny the right of Members to have a vote on something they \nview to be very important.\n  The minimum wage must come before our Senate colleagues. The minimum \nwage must be voted upon. Whether it is on this bill or another bill, \nhopefully in the not too distant future we can work out an arrangement \nthat will allow us the opportunity to vote on an issue that is of great \nimportance to millions and millions of working families. Let us hope it \nis sooner rather than later.\n\n\n                      Congressional Investigations\n\n  Finally, I think it is important to note that there will be many, \nmany investigations on a lot of different issues. Senator Bumpers said \nit so well just a moment ago. Often the reason investigations occur is \nthat is where the lights are, that is where the cameras are. While \nthere is an unlimited array of opportunities for our colleagues to \ninvestigate, I must say I am astounded, absolutely astounded that so \nmany of our colleagues in the House of Representatives, who claim to be \nfiscal conservatives, who claim to be protecting the taxpayer at each \nand every turn, will now support a so-called investigation for $1 \nmillion in taxpayers' money to look at whether or not arms shipments \nwere made to Bosnians in a way that may or may not be questionable--$1 \nmillion.\n  This is from our colleagues in the House who have said over and over \nagain we want to balance the budget, we want to cut down expenses, cut \nHead Start, cut school lunch, cut all the programs directly affecting \nchildren and education; we are going to cut and cut and cut everything \naffecting real people. But when it comes to an investigation that has \nvirtually no basis, which has already been investigated in the \nintelligence committees, we are going to find a way to spend $1 million \nand we are going to try to spend that $1 million in the next couple of \nmonths. For Heaven's sake, where does it all end? And how, with a \nstraight face, can any of our colleagues conclude that an issue of this \nlimited scope is worth a $1 million investigation?\n  I do not even know how they are going to spend it. Maybe they will \nbuy television ads with it, who knows? But I must tell you, I think \nthat is a waste. And I hope our colleagues on the other side will do \neverything in their power to see the taxpayers are given a better \naccounting; to see that we put a stop to that kind of flagrant abuse of \nauthority. That ought not happen.\n  We have seen too much of it in this Congress. Again, it is an \nillustration of the extreme level, the extreme degree to which some on \nthe other side will go to make a political point. That is wrong. It is \ndeeply unfortunate. It sends all the wrong messages about what we ought \nto be doing and how sincere we are in bringing about a balanced Federal \nbudget.\n  We will be debating a balanced budget perhaps as early as next week, \nonce again. And how ironic, as we talk about amending our Constitution, \nthat somehow we can find ways to spend $1 million on whether or not \narms were shipped to our Bosnian friends in a way that was generally \nsupported by many of our colleagues on the other side. So, we will have \nmuch more to say about that in the future.\n  I hope we can work in a bipartisan way to resolve whatever \noutstanding questions there are about what happened, whether it was in \nour long-term best interests to do so. All we can say with certainty is \nthat our Bosnian policy is working. Having been there myself, having \ntalked to the military, having talked to all of those directly \ninvolved, I can say without equivocation, this has been a success story \nthe likes of which nobody could have realized a few months ago, a \nsuccess story for which we can be very, very proud.\n  I hope we can continue to build upon that success and send the right \nmessage about our intentions there and the opportunity to bring real \npeace.
