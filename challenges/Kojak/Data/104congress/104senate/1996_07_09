Under the previous order, the \nSenate will now resume consideration of H.R. 3448, which the clerk will \nreport.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (H.R. 3448) to provide tax relief for small \n     businesses, to protect jobs, to create opportunities, to \n     increase the take-home pay of workers, to amend the Portal-\n     to-Portal Act of 1947 relating to the payment of wages to \n     employees who use employer-owned vehicles, and to amend the \n     Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 to increase the minimum wage \n     rate and to prevent job loss by providing flexibility to \n     employers in complying with minimum wage and overtime \n     requirements under that act.\n\n  The Senate resumed consideration of the bill.\n       Pending:\n       Kennedy amendment No. 4435, to amend the Fair Labor \n     Standards Act of 1938 to provide for an increase in the \n     minimum wage rate and to exempt computer professionals from \n     the minimum wage and maximum hour requirements, and to amend \n     the Portal-to-Portal Act of 1947 relating to the payment of \n     wages to employees who use employer-owned vehicles.\n       Bond amendment No. 4272, to modify the payment of wages \n     provisions.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time until 12:30 p.m. shall be equally \ndivided between the Senator from Delaware and the Senator from New York \nor their designees.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, may I ask the Senator a question? Did the \nSenator include a vote on the TEAM Act after the Defense authorization? \nIs that referenced in the Senator's list of votes?\n  Mr. NICKLES. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I thank the Senator.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who seeks recognition?\n  Mr. ROTH addressed the Chair.\n\n[[Page S7422]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware is recognized.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, America's most valuable economic resource is \nthe spirit of enterprise that moves in our people. This spirit is \nreflected in men and women and families that build businesses on \ndreams, personal risk, and good ideas. It is reflected in the strength \nof our communities, communities held together by commerce. It is \nreflected in the strong economic status our Nation enjoys, indeed, in \nour superpower status. And it is reflected in the security and \nopportunity we enjoy as individuals.\n  The responsibility of Congress, of Government in general, is to help \npromote an environment where this spirit can flourish, especially among \nAmerica's small business men and women.\n  How important is it that we succeed in this endeavor? Consider that \nthere are 22 million small business owners in America today, and that \neach year another 800,000 new small startups are created. Consider that \nnearly 6 out of 10 Americans get their paychecks from small businesses \nand that small business represents 99.8 percent of all American \nbusinesses. They contribute more than half of our sales in our country. \nThey provide more than half of our economy's output and 55 percent of \nall new innovations each year.\n  Consider, Mr. President, that of the 25 million future jobs that will \nbe needed to provide employment for Americans, 75 percent will come \nfrom small business. Recently, I heard that the majority of small \nbusinesses today are being created by women. With these trends in mind, \nwe can see how important it is that we succeed in passing a small \nbusiness bill that meets the real needs of America's entrepreneurs, a \nbill that unleashes enterprise and rewards risk taking.\n  Toward this end, Senator Moynihan and I have spent a great deal of \ntime taking comments from our colleagues pertaining to this small \nbusiness bill. We have consulted with the leadership on both sides of \nthe aisle. We believe we have developed an amendment that addresses the \nrequests and comments we received.\n  Before turning my attention to the managers' and leaders' amendment, \nhowever, I would like to address the tax provisions to the small \nbusiness bill that are proposed by the Finance Committee.\n  For small business, the only thing worse than excessive taxation is a \nvisit from the people at ``60 Minutes.'' Frankly, Mr. President, I know \nseveral small business men and women who would rather face Mike \nWallace. Excessive taxes are the sludge that binds the gears of small \nbusiness, and we must do something about them.\n  The tax provisions proposed by the Finance Committee represents a \ngood start. They lift some of the burden that is borne by small \nbusinesses. They make it easier for small business men and women to \nhire, to expand, to modernize. Our tax provisions facilitate the \nability of small businesses to offer retirement plans for their \nemployees. They allow businesses to bring more employees into pension \nplans.\n\n  Beyond all of this, we make both undergraduate and graduate education \nmore affordable for employees by extending the tax-free treatment of \nemployer-provided education assistance. These are incentives that will \ngo a long way toward creating an environment for growth, job creation, \neconomic security, and real opportunity for Americans. Legislation with \nsimilar tax incentives passed the House by a vote of 414-10.\n  Specifically, what this bill does is provide an increase in the \nexpensing of small business equipment from the current $17,500 annual \namount to $25,000 by the year 2003. It offers a package of subchapter S \ncorporation reforms that will improve the ability of small business men \nand women to use this corporate status. Among a number of reforms, the \nprincipal changes include increasing the number of subchapter S \ncorporation shareholders, easing the use of subchapter S corporations \nin the area of estate planning, broadening the access of subchapter S \ncorporations for small banks, employee stock ownership plans and \ncharities, and granting greater flexibility in the use of multiple \nsubchapter S corporations. Additionally, the reforms will permit \ntaxpayers to keep subchapter S corporation status, and allow \ncorrections for inadvertent mistakes.\n\n  Our bill also contains pension simplification proposals, including \nspousal IRA's and a new kind of pension plan for small business. Our \npurpose here is to increase access to the pension system for the \nmillions of small business employees who currently do not have this \nimportant security. One of my major objectives is that spouses be \ntreated equally when it comes to pension benefits and individual \nretirement accounts. Currently, a homemaker can only contribute up to \n$250 to an IRA. Under our plan, they would be able to invest up to \n$2,000, the same amount contributed by their spouses.\n  In addition, our package permits tax-exempt organizations to set up \nsection 401(k) opportunities for their employees, and it simplifies \npension rules for employers who currently offer pension plans. Beyond \nthis, we offer a package of proposals that extend tax benefits that \nhave expired. These important benefits include the tax credit for \nresearch and development which keeps us competitive in the global \neconomic community. They include credits for the very expensive costs \nassociated with the development and testing of drugs for rare diseases. \nThese are often referred to as ``orphan drugs''--orphans because their \nlimited demand makes it otherwise cost prohibitive to research, \ndevelop, and market them.\n  Included in the package of extenders is an extension of the section \n29 alternative fuels credit. This credit provides an incentive for the \nproduction of clean and environmentally friendly energy sources.\n  Mr. President, in the last 5 years, small businesses have created 9 \nout of 10 new jobs. In fact, small business provided all the net new \njobs from 1987 to 1992. Mr. President, 9 out of 10 of these firms have \nfewer than 20 employees. They are, indeed, the heroes on the front \nline. With these changes to the tax law, these small business men and \nwomen will have greater incentives and resources to move our economy \nforward.\n  Should anyone doubt how stalwart these men and women are compared to \nthose in other countries, should anyone doubt that Government policies \nhave consequences on their ability to succeed, I refer to a recent \narticle from the London Sunday Telegraph. According to that paper,\n\n       The United States has created 30 times more new private-\n     sector jobs in the European Union over the last 20 years. . . \n     The British Treasury reported that the EU created fewer than \n     1 million net jobs, compared with more than 31 million \n     produced by the more deregulated American economy.\n\n       The stark Treasury figures paint a much grimmer picture \n     than the Foreign Office' recent White Paper on Europe, which \n     claimed that the EU had created 8 million jobs over the same \n     period.\n       Compiled from independent figures, the Treasury tracks \n     detailed employment patterns between the two trading blocks \n     for 1974-1994. With roughly similar populations during that \n     period of around 250 million, they show the United States \n     created 31,306,000 net new jobs in the private sector to \n     Europe's 823,000. . .\n       Speaking in London on Friday. . . the French commissioner \n     for a single currency, admitted that overzealous EU \n     regulation had taken its toll on job creation.\n\n  Mr. President, taxation and regulation do have profound influences on \nthe ability of nations to create jobs. What we propose is to take some \nof the burden off the backs of American small business men and women. \nMy hope is that this is only a beginning, but it is a good beginning.\n  Now, our tax provision to the Small Business Job Protection Act of \n1996 passed the committee unanimously. There is no reason why we cannot \nsee similar success here on the floor.\n  Mr. President, I now turn our attention to the managers' and leaders' \namendment. In developing this amendment, I believe we have maintained \nthe goals that were set out in crafting the campaign finance reform \nbill. Our objectives were, first, to retain the bipartisan spirit of \nthe bill. Second, to stay with two basic themes: To create incentives \nfor small business and economic growth; and to extend many of the \nimportant tax provisions that have either expired or are set to expire. \nOur third objective sought to refrain from opening up controversial \nissues, issues that would divide Republicans and Democrats here on the \nfloor.\n\n[[Page S7423]]\n\n                           Amendment No. 4436\n\n              (Purpose: To provide additional amendments.)\n\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I send to the desk a copy of the managers' \nand leaders' amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Delaware [Mr. Roth], for himself, Mr. \n     Moynihan, Mr. Lott, and Mr. Daschle, proposes an amendment \n     numbered 4436.\n\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The text of the amendment is printed in today's Record under \n``Amendments Submitted.'')\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I note that a copy of the amendment and its \nexplanation will be available on the desk of each Senator on the Senate \nfloor.\n  Many Members of the Senate have raised tax proposals for \nconsideration in this managers' and leaders' amendment. Some of these \nproposals are outside the scope of the objectives I mentioned. Other \nproposals are relevant to our objectives but they are controversial or \ncostly.\n  This managers' and leaders' amendment strives to stick with the small \nbusiness and extenders themes, so these controversial, nongermane \nproposals are not included.\n  Mr. President, the major components of the managers' amendment are:\n  First, to extend most of the expired provisions to December 31, 1997. \nThis is a half-year extension. I note that the section 29 alternative \nfuels credit is extended to December 31, 1998, and the grandfather for \ncertain publicly traded partnerships is extended to December 31, 1999.\n  Second, this amendment provides additional pension simplification \nprovisions. Most of these are directed at protecting spouses of pension \nplan participants.\n  Third, at the request of a bipartisan group of Labor Committee \nSenators, led by Senator Kassebaum, our amendment offers a \nclarification of the effect of the Harris Trust Supreme Court case. The \nHarris Trust case overturned 20 years of Labor Department policy \nregarding insurance companies. It created additional uncertainty about \nthe liability of insurance companies that fund employee benefit plans. \nOur proposal adopts the Labor Committee's directive to the Labor \nDepartment, mandating a clarification of the treatment of insurance \ncompanies under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act [ERISA].\n  In a recent letter from Secretary Robert Reich, he stated the Labor \nDepartment's strong support for the Labor Committee's bill. In that \nletter, the Secretary writes: ``The legislation will provide the \nguidance necessary to avert disruption in the insurance industry, \nthereby improving the security of American workers' pension plan \nassets.''\n  Fourth, our amendment provides additional clarifications of the \nworker classification safe harbor known as section 530. This concerns \nthe distinction between employees and independent contractors for \nemployment tax purposes. I believe these additional clarifications are \nnecessary steps to help clear up the confusion and controversy in \nworker classification.\n  Mr. President, the managers' and leaders' amendment is fully offset, \nand I would like to comment on a couple of these.\n  First, the managers' and leaders' amendment adopts a proposal from \nthe President's budget that denies the personal exemption deduction and \ndependent care credit if taxpayers do not supply the dependent's Social \nSecurity number. I believe this proposal is necessary to insure against \nfraud.\n  Another important offset is the extension of the 10-percent air \nticket and cargo excise taxes.\n  The House bill did not include an extension of this ticket tax. The \naviation program's authorization terminates on September 30, 1996. In \nresponse to concerns raised by Commerce Committee members, the Finance \nCommittee bill extends the ticket tax through the end of this year as \nan interim measure to ensure adequate funding for the aviation program \nuntil it is reauthorized.\n  Under the managers' and leaders' amendment, the air ticket and cargo \nexcise taxes are further extended until April 15, 1997--an additional \n3\\1/2\\ months. This is an extension I agreed to reluctantly and one I \nbelieve should be revisited in conference with the House.\n  Mr. President, I believe the managers' and leaders' amendment lives \nup to the spirit of the bipartisan Finance Committee bill. I urge my \ncolleagues' support.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York is recognized.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I will not take a great deal of time \nthis morning as I spoke yesterday, and there are Senators who wish to \nspeak to other provisions of this bill. But I would take as much time \nas is required to state my gratitude to and admiration for the work of \nthe chairman, our chairman, Senator Roth.\n  Mr. President, would you care to pause for a moment and ask, how many \nunanimous, bipartisan, 100-page bills have you seen come to the Senate \nfloor in the 104th Congress? I think not many. I dare to think there \nhas not been even one.\n  The chairman has crafted a major tax cut--a major tax cut. It comes \nfrom a unanimous Finance Committee, and it has other matters attached \nto it. But I hope that as we debate those other matters, we would not \noverlook the substantive, important revenue provisions in this bill.\n  I just want to say it is very difficult to make it look easy, and the \nchairman has managed that. I want to express my appreciation.\n  I would particularly call attention to the employer-provided \neducational assistance provisions in this bill. This, Mr. President, is \nalmost surely the most successful education program the Federal \nGovernment sponsors. A million persons a year are provided higher \neducation by their employers, and the tuition is tax free.\n  I had occasion to speak about this yesterday. Outside the \norganizations involved, not many people would know of this program. \nThere is no bureau in the Department of Labor for employer-provided \neducational assistance, and no bureaucracy; it has no titles, no \nconfirmations, no assistant secretaries. A million persons a year are \nsent by their employers to higher education, about a quarter for \ngraduate-level education, with the understanding that they are capable \nof doing work at higher levels and skills and compensation, and that it \nis mutually rewarding to the individual and the firm.\n  To say again, a quarter of these individuals are going to graduate \nschools, and very complex ones. Ask any major employer about their \ntraining systems, and they will say nothing is more helpful than being \nable to send a promising young person, or middle management person, to \na graduate school to learn a new field, learn a field that has \ndeveloped since that person had his education. That can be very rapid \nin many technologies. Consider the area of software: 16 years is \nanother era.\n  We have had employer-provided educational assistance in place since \n1978, but we have been on and off about keeping it in place. It has \nexpired. Now we are going to bring it back--retroactive to the last \nday's expiration, up to December 31 of this year. In the managers' \namendment, we extend it another year.\n  I would like to simply say to the chairman that I hope early in the \nnext Congress we can make this provision permanent so it can be \ndepended on. This will permit workers to make it part of their plans. \nThey can go off to the University of Delaware and take another degree \nin advanced chemistry, and then come back in another, better, position. \nIt is part of your career program, and it should be. This is a \nwonderful piece of unobtrusive social policy.\n  I would also like to thank the chairman for including in the \nmanagers' amendment a version of the expatriation proposal I first \nintroduced in 1995. I will not go into the details at great length, but \nwe have resolved the expatriation issue in this bill. Expatriation is \nthe matter of individuals, wealthy individuals, who renounce their \nAmerican citizenship in order to avoid American taxes. This is no small \nsum. In the course of the next 10 years, this provision will pick up \n$1.7 billion.\n\n[[Page S7424]]\n\n  This issue arose in 1995 when the Finance Committee reported a bill \nto restore the health insurance deduction for the self-employed. We \nwere going to include expatriation at that time, and yet we had a \nseries of communications from scholars of the first order, including \nProf. Paul B. Stephan III, a specialist in both international law and \ntax law at the University of Virginia Law School; Mr. Stephen E. Shay, \nwho served as international tax counsel at the Department of the \nTreasury; Detlev Vagts of Harvard Law; Andreas F. Lowenfeld of New York \nUniversity Law; and particularly Prof. Hurst Hannum of the Fletcher \nSchool of Law and Diplomacy at Tufts University, who raised the \nquestion of whether our statute was legal under the International \nCovenant on Civil and Political Rights, which the United States \nratified in 1992. It is our law, treaty law, and it is therefore the \nsupreme Law of the Land under article VI of our Constitution.\n  Section 2 of article 12 of the international covenant states: \n``Everyone shall be free to leave any country, including his own.''\n  The expatriation legislation had seemed to legal scholars to raise a \nquestion of infringement of the treaty and, in effect, the law would \nfall before the treaty, the treaty being the higher law. Professor \nRobert F. Turner, a professor of international law at the U.S. Naval \nWar College, so testified before the Finance Committee. Although other \nexperts gave us contrary opinions, it was clear to us that the Senate \nshould not act improvidently on the matter. Genuine questions of human \nrights under international law, and the solemn obligations of the \nUnited States under treaties, were in question. So when the conference \ncommittee met on the self-employed health deduction bill, we had no \nalternative but to defer a decision on the matter until we got it \nstraight. To do otherwise, obviously, would have been not only \nimprudent but irresponsible.\n  Even so, there are persons in the Chamber who wondered whether or not \nwe were looking after millionaires who renounce their citizenship and \nmove to the Bahamas, and there were some rather heated exchanges. I \nsaid at that time that you never have to be more careful of human \nrights than when you are dealing with persons who are despised. Nobody \nthinks very much of a millionaire who chooses to become a Bahamian and \nkeeps his membership in the Woonsocket Yacht Club.\n  In the ensuing months, a general consensus developed that it was \npossible to craft legislation to curb the abuse of expatriation without \nviolating our international legal obligations. Which is precisely what \nthis bill does. We were determined, and we now bring to the floor, Mr. \nPresident, a measure which addresses the problem--and which will raise \n$1.7 billion over 10 years. Although not many people expatriate, their \ntax liabilities are significant. So this provision will raise $1.7 \nbillion. The Finance Committee has a record, we hope, of being vigilant \nabout abuses but also concerned and careful about rights. So, Mr. \nPresident, I would like to thank again the chairman for this work. We \nhave done it well.\n  We are going to have to be careful in conference about the provisions \non Puerto Rico. We have major provisions we have decided to end after \n60 years, the provisions under section 936 of the Internal Revenue \nCode, but I think we are doing so in a way that is acceptable to the \nelected officials in Puerto Rico and all in all is a good job. It took \nus 2 years to get it right, and we bring it before you with pride and \nconfidence that it will be enacted--whatever else happens in the course \nof the day.\n  Mr. ROTH addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware is recognized.\n  Mr. ROTH. I thank my good friend and colleague, Senator Moynihan, for \nhis contribution to the development of both the Finance Committee \nlegislation as well as the managers' amendment. It could not have been \ndone without his contribution. I just want it to be known that he has, \nas always, brought great intelligence, skill, and knowledge to this \nmost important task.\n  I share with him his interest and concern in education. I think it is \nonly fair to say that in today's world, where technology and knowledge \nare changing so rapidly, there has never been a time for it to be more \nimportant that we keep the most well educated people anywhere in the \nworld, and certainly Senator Moynihan has been a leader in that effort.\n  I have to say to my distinguished colleague that many of these \nextenders I think are critically important. One of my first questions \non it is, Why don't we make them permanent? Unfortunately, we have a \nproblem of cost and budget rules, but this is something that we will \nhave to look at jointly in the future.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I take that remark with great \nencouragement. I think the chairman is right. When the chairman is \nright, he will figure how to do what is right. I thank him very much.\n  Mr. ROTH. At this time, I am happy to yield to the senior Senator \nfrom Kansas.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas is recognized.\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM. Mr. President, I very much appreciate the chairman of \nthe Finance Committee yielding to me for just a moment to comment on \none aspect of the bill. I think the package that has been put together \nby the Finance Committee under the distinguished leadership of both the \nchairman and ranking member is an important package. I am \nparticularly pleased that, for example, there has been provision for \neducational assistance and the orphan drug tax credit. These were \nexpiring credits that have been extended that I think are very \nimportant. I am also pleased that the extension of the airway and \nairport trust fund has been acknowledged, and I would like to speak to \nthe clarification of the application of ERISA to insurance company \ngeneral accounts. This has also been included in the managers' package, \nand I am not sure that it is clearly understood. I am very appreciative \nof it being included, and I think it was important to do so. If I may, \nMr. President, just for a moment speak to what this is about.\n\n  The Department of Labor has been working closely with all parties for \nnearly 3 years to address the complex issue raised by the Harris Trust \ndecision of the Supreme Court in December 1993. They ruled then in John \nHancock versus Harris Trust that this longstanding practice of \nincluding pension assets as part of a general account could violate \nERISA. The Court recognized it was overturning the Department's ruling \nand that its decision created the possibility of serious disruptions in \nthe pension marketplace. It indicated, however, that any problems could \nbe addressed legislatively or administratively. So that is what this is \nabout, and that is why this bill has the full support of this \nadministration. The administration believed that it had to be addressed \nlegislatively and that was the only way that we could fully acknowledge \nthe difficulties that were apparent by the Supreme Court's decision.\n  In its January 17, 1996 letter of support, Secretary Reich writes \nthat the legislation:\n\n       Will provide the guidance necessary to avert disruption in \n     the insurance industry, thereby improving the security of \n     American workers' pension plan assets.\n\n  Let me make clear the ERISA Clarification Act, as this is called, \ndoes not overturn Harris Trust. Rather, it requires the Labor \nDepartment to issue guidance by March of next year as to how insurance \ncompanies are to deal with pension plans in the future. To protect the \nrights of plan participants and beneficiaries, consistent with the \nHarris Trust decision, any guidance issued by the Department must \ncontain strict standards that companies must meet in order to qualify \nfor the relief. Failure to comply with these rules will subject any \ncompany to all the sanctions imposed by ERISA on those who violate the \nfiduciary responsibility and prohibited transaction rules.\n  The legislation also prevents the Harris Trust decision from being \napplied retroactively. This is appropriate because the life insurance \nindustry has relied for almost 20 years on Government's interpretation \nas to how it was to act under the statute and because exposing the \nindustry to retroactive liability could severely threaten the security \nof pension assets.\n  In response to some initial concerns raised by the administration and \nothers, the legislation before us contains\n\n[[Page S7425]]\n\nseveral modifications. Most important: No. 1, the legislation contains \nnew, stricter standards to ensure that any guidance issued by the Labor \nDepartment must fully protect the rights and interests of plan \nparticipants and beneficiaries; and, No. 2, the legislation would not \ngrant relief from proceedings based on fraudulent or criminal \nactivities by insurers. I would also like to point out the bill does \nnot affect any ongoing civil actions.\n  I think this is very important that this be included in the \nmanagement package at this time. This is in addition to the State \ninsurance regulations that already provide important protections to \ncontract holders, so I am confident that there is the protection there \nthat is necessary, and it is important that this be enacted at this \ntime in order to ensure the security of pension assets for millions of \nAmerican workers and retirees who hold assets in insurance company \ngeneral accounts.\n  So I am very pleased and express my appreciation, again, to both the \ndistinguished chairman and ranking member of the Finance Committee for \nincluding this important legislation in their managers' amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time? The Senator from \nMassachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Will my friend, the ranking minority member of the \nFinance Committee, be willing to yield 10 minutes?\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Of course. The Senator spoke eloquently yesterday, and \nI look forward to hearing him do the same today.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, will the Chair let me know when there is \na minute and a half left, please.\n  Mr. President, the other part of this debate is about the basic, \nunderlying issue, which is whether this country is going to respond to \nthe very powerful needs of working families who are working 40 hours a \nweek, 52 weeks a year, playing by the rules, trying to provide for \ntheir families. That is really the underlying issue which the Senate is \ngoing to be voting on in the early afternoon. I wish to address that \nparticular part of the debate and the alternatives which will be before \nthe Senate.\n  Minimum wage workers are the people who do some of the most thankless \njobs in America. They are Head Start schoolteachers, they are teachers' \naides who work with the 50 million of our young people in kindergarten \nthrough 12th grade. They are health care workers who look after our \nparents in nursing homes and in hospitals all across this country. They \nclean the offices and restrooms, collect the garbage at the curb, make \nthe beds in fancy hotels, mop up the floors in public schools and \nhospitals. Minimum wage workers are the people who make the engine of \nour economy work while laboring behind the scenes and toiling at the \ndrudgery jobs that must be done for America to thrive.\n  Minimum wage workers have dreams for their families, their children, \nand their future, just like all other Americans. They have served their \ncountry in war and peace, and they still believe in the American dream. \nThey cry into their pillows at night when their children are sick and \nthey have no money for the doctor. They are giving to America, not \ntaking from America. They are fighting to stay off welfare because of \nthe shame they would feel if they took a handout from a Government \nestablished for the people and by the people. Their faces pressed \nagainst the windows of our affluence, they see the riches and abundance \nthat so many take for granted but so often seems beyond their reach. \nBut if they work hard and well, they know their children will have a \ngreater chance for a better life.\n  The minimum wage increase the Senate will vote on today will bring \nmillions of those workers closer to that dream, and I urge the Senate \nto vote in a spirit of generosity that extends a helping hand, not the \nback of your hand, to all those who need and deserve this help. Today, \nwe have the opportunity to put action behind the rhetoric of family \nvalues. If we really care about work, about families, about children \nand the future, we will vote for an increase in the minimum wage for \nall workers.\n  If we care about helping the working poor, then we must support an \nincrease in the minimum wage, regardless of the size of the company \nthey work for. If we want to help minorities and women and single \nparents, then we must raise the minimum wage for all workers without \nthe so-called opportunity wage. If we want to help adults stay off the \nwelfare rolls, we must raise the minimum wage.\n  Support for the minimum wage is an effective way to achieve the basic \ngoal of improving the lives of American workers. Raising the minimum \nwage is long overdue. The increase we are voting on today should take \neffect as soon as possible, obviously prospectively, I hope some 30 \ndays after the President signs it into law. And it should be available \nto all minimum wage workers.\n  I urge the Senate to reject artificial limitations on the size of the \ncompany or the time the worker has been on the job. Reject the \ngimmickry and chicanery we see in the Bond proposal.\n  A fair minimum wage is the goal. No one who works for a living should \nhave to live in poverty, and I urge the Senate to vote for the \nDemocratic amendment and against the Republican amendment.\n  Mr. President, this issue is about the number of individuals earning \nthe minimum wage and whose hopes and dreams are in the future. They are \nabout Tonya Outlaw of Windsor, NC, the parent of two girls, ages 6 and \n8. She works as a teacher at the Kiddie World Child Development Center. \nShe worked there for 3\\1/2\\ years. She used to work at the Purdue \nchicken factory, where she used to earn more than minimum wage, but it \nwas not enough to pay for child care. In order to work, Tonya needed \nchild care for her children. Working at Kiddie World provided a \nsolution.\n  Now Tonya earns $4.25 an hour, and it is very hard to get her family \nthe things they need. She said sometimes it is hard to provide her \nchildren with things they need like coats, medicines, and other types \nof essential needs. Tonya is unable to afford the insurance that they \nmake available at her children's school, and she is unable to provide \nher children the medicine they need when they are sick. If they \nincrease the minimum wage, she hopes to afford a place of her own, for \nher family. It is time for her to get a raise in the minimum wage.\n  It is time for Alvin Vance, who is 45 years old and works picking up \nresidential garbage. He earns the minimum wage of $4.25 an hour. He \nworks 50 hours a week, counting 10 hours of overtime. This provide him \nwith about $200 take-home pay. Alvin receives no health benefits or \npaid vacation, no paid sick days. If Alvin is sick, he will go to the \ncharity hospital where he can obtain services with little or no charge.\n  Alvin receives no AFDC, WIC, or food stamps. His rent is $125 a month \nfor a one-room shack in a high-crime neighborhood. He has no car and \nmust get a ride or walk to work, which is 7 miles away. It is time for \nhim to get a living minimum wage.\n  We heard comments today about the bipartisanship which has \naccompanied the provisions in this proposal that has been recommended \nby the Finance Committee. Just to point out once again the \nbipartisanship which has existed on the minimum wage in the past, Harry \nTruman in 1949, with President Eisenhower in 1955, President Kennedy in \n1961 and 1963--increases; President Johnson in 1967 and 1968, President \nNixon and President Ford, 1974 through 1976; President Carter, 1978 \nthrough 1981, President Bush, 1990 to 1991. This has been a bipartisan \neffort.\n  This is what Senator Bob Dole said in 1974:\n\n       A living wage for a fair day's work is a hallmark of the \n     American economic philosophy.\n\n  President Nixon, April 1974, on signing the minimum wage:\n\n       The federally legislated minimum wage for most American \n     workers has remained static for 6 years despite a number of \n     increases in the cost of living. Raising the minimum wage is \n     now a matter of justice that can no longer be fairly delayed.\n\n  We go into the more recent years in 1989 and 1990, President George \nBush:\n\n       It gives me great pleasure to sign into law the first \n     increase in the minimum wage since 1981.\n       I have called for an increase in the minimum wage that \n     would protect jobs and put more money in the pockets of our \n     workers. . . I am pleased to sign it. It offers promise of \n     better wages for working men and women.\n\n\n[[Page S7426]]\n\n\n  Senator Dan Coats during the debate on the minimum wage increase:\n\n       Let me state that I am one Senator who is convinced that an \n     increase in the minimum wage is justified. I do think that by \n     doing so, we can assist an element of the public, the working \n     poor, often those a step below or just a step above welfare \n     and above poverty. And that since the minimum wage has not \n     been increased since January of 1981, and since it has lost \n     in that time period nearly 20 percent of its value to \n     inflation, then an increase in the minimum wage is justified.\n\n  It had lost nearly 20 percent of its value in 1989, and Dan Coats at \nthat time was supporting an increase. Now it is at the lowest level of \npurchasing power in 40 years, and the economy's strength certainly \nclearly justifies this increase.\n  Mr. President, this is an issue about work. It is an issue about \nchildren.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is advised he has 1\\1/2\\ minutes \nremaining.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I thank the Chair. This is an issue about children, the \nchildren of working families that are working hard and trying to make \nit. This is an issue about women. More than 60 percent of the full-time \nminimum wage recipients are women. It is an issue about families and \nfamily values. It is an issue about the taxpayers, because this is \ngoing to lift over some 100,000 families out of poverty, 300,000 \nchildren out of poverty, reducing the burden on the taxpayers, on AFDC \nand the Food Stamp Program and other support programs.\n  Most of all, it is about work. Are we going to honor work in our \nsociety? Are we going to say men and women who play by the rules, work \nhard 40 hours a week 52 weeks of the year are going to have a living \nwage for themselves, their children, and their future? That is the \noption that will be here to vote on at 2:15 and 2:30 this afternoon. I \nhope we will support Senator Daschle's amendment.\n  Mr. GRAMM addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas is recognized.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, recognizing that we are unlikely here on \nthe floor of the Senate to repeal the law of supply and demand, as many \nof our Members would like us to try to do, we have included in this \ndebate a tax bill, H.R. 3448, the Small Business Job Protection Act of \n1996, which was put together on a bipartisan basis to try to offset \nsome of the negative impacts of an increase in the minimum wage, \nespecially as it relates to increasing unemployment among young people \nwith low skill levels. What I would like to do this morning is talk \nabout some very positive provisions in that bill and explain why I am \nfor the Small Business Job Protection Act of 1996.\n  I want to talk specifically about four provisions of this bill that I \nhave been directly involved in, and explain to my colleagues why they \nare important and why it is critical that this bill pass and why we \nmust send a bill to the President which can be signed.\n  The first issue I want to talk about has to do with agricultural club \ndues. We have had, since 1987, a running dispute between the Internal \nRevenue Service and the Farm Bureau about Farm Bureau dues. In this \nbill, we have a provision that I and others have pushed which says to \nthe Internal Revenue Service that: First, dues to the Farm Bureau are \nnot taxable Farm Bureau income; second, that the Farm Bureau is a \nnonprofit agricultural research and business promotion institution \nwhich is owned by its members; and third, that being part of the Farm \nBureau is being part of agriculture.\n\n  Interestingly enough, the Internal Revenue Service did not oppose our \neffort to say to them that in the future, Farm Bureau dues will not be \nviewed as income to the Farm Bureau. Yet for some unexplainable reason, \nthe Internal Revenue Service has continued to press ongoing lawsuits \nagainst Farm Bureaus in Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Kentucky, Michigan, \nMissouri, North Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, Washington State and \nAlabama. In these States, there is ongoing litigation--instituted by \nthe Internal Revenue Service--where the IRS is trying to force the Farm \nBureau to pay taxes they do not owe.\n  I do not understand how the Internal Revenue Service can say that \nthey are willing to be supportive of an act of Congress that defines \nthat for all future times, dues to the Farm Bureau are not taxable \nincome, but yet refuses to go back and drop all these lawsuits. We had \nhoped in the Finance Committee to work out an agreement on this issue. \nI worked with the chairman and the ranking member who were hopeful that \nthe Internal Revenue Service would issue a position paper saying that \nit would drop these existing lawsuits, but the Internal Revenue Service \nhas refused to do that.\n  In fact, Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a letter to this \neffect, from the Assistant Secretary of the Treasury for Tax Policy, be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                   Department of the Treasury,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, June 24, 1996.\n     Hon. Phil Gramm,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Gramm: This letter is in response to the \n     question you raised at the Senate Finance Committee mark-up \n     held on Wednesday, June 12, 1996 concerning farm bureaus.\n       Last year, in Revenue Procedure 95-15, we clarified that no \n     tax is to be imposed on associate member dues payments \n     received by tax-exempt agricultural organizations unless the \n     organization's principal purpose in forming or availing \n     itself of an associate member class was to produce income \n     from an unrelated trade or business.\\1\\ The approach in the \n     ruling reflects current law. See National League of \n     Postmasters v. Commissioner, sl. op. (4th Cir. June 14, \n     1996,), affirming T.C. Memo 1995-205 (May 11, 1995).\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n     \\1\\ As noted in the Senate Finance Committee report \n     accompanying H.R. 3448, the focus of the inquiry under the \n     Revenue Procedure ``is upon the organization's purposes in \n     forming the associate member category (and whether the \n     purposes of that category of membership are substantially \n     related to the organization's exempt purposes other than \n     through the production of income). . . .''\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n       While Rev. Proc. 95-15 was being developed, the IRS \n     suspended its examinations of agricultural organizations to \n     ensure that any associate member dues issues that had been \n     raised would be resolved consistently with the analysis in \n     the Revenue Procedure. We are confident that as the IRS \n     finishes the remaining examinations on this issue, it will \n     follow the Revenue Procedure in analyzing the activities of \n     farm bureaus and the income they receive with respect to \n     their associate members.\n       Of course for periods to which the proposed legislation \n     would apply (Section 1113 of the Small Business Job \n     Protection Act of 1996), the treatment of associate member \n     dues paid to agricultural organizations would follow the \n     statute as amended.\n       Nevertheless, if there are cases under audit for taxable \n     years beginning prior to December 31, 1994 which cannot meet \n     even the test of the Revenue Procedure, it is not possible to \n     provide administrative relief, other than relief that may be \n     available under section 7805(b) of the Internal Revenue Code. \n     Thus, you should be aware that, because each case will be \n     determined according to its own facts and circumstances, we \n     cannot assure you that the IRS will provide administrative \n     relief in these pre-effective date cases beyond the guidance \n     provided in Revenue Procedure 95-15.\n       Please call us if you have any further questions.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 Donald C. Lubick,\n                          Acting Assistant Secretary (Tax Policy).\n\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, to get to the bottom line, basically, the \nInternal Revenue Service has said that no matter what Congress does in \nterms of defining dues to the Farm Bureau as nontaxable income, they \nare going to pursue these lawsuits anyway. So we will be offering later \nas part of the managers' amendment an amendment that I have authored \nwhich basically says to the Internal Revenue Service, ``We have made a \ndecision in Congress, we want these frivolous lawsuits to be dropped, \nand we want them to be dropped now.''\n  This is an issue that should be settled. The position of the IRS is \nindefensible in the opinion of the vast majority of Members of Congress \nand is indefensible in the opinion of the vast majority of the American \npeople. We not only want the IRS to stop doing this in the future, we \nwant them to go back to these old lawsuits and end this harassment once \nand for all.\n  We are taking a major step in that direction in this bill. In an \namendment that the chairman will offer on my behalf later and on behalf \nof others, we are also going to go back and, in essence, say to the \nIRS, ``Drop these lawsuits and end this issue once and for all.''\n  The second issue that I think is important in this bill is also \nanother IRS issue. For some unexplainable reason, roughly 3 years ago, \nthe Internal Revenue Service decided that newspapers\n\n[[Page S7427]]\n\nand paperboys were cheating the Internal Revenue Service. The Internal \nRevenue Service, in a series of lawsuits filed all over the country \nagainst major daily newspapers, said that paperboys--and I use the term \n``paperboy'' because there is no comparable gender neutral term in the \nEnglish language that I have found, and though I was once a paperboy, \nif someone has a gender neutral term, I will be happy to use it--but \nuntil they do, I will use the one that people recognize.\n  In any case, the Internal Revenue Service has argued that paperboys \nare not legitimate independent contractors and that they have, in \nessence, conspired with newspapers to avoid being employees and, in the \nprocess, have not paid Social Security taxes, withholding taxes, \nunemployment insurance, and Medicare taxes. The ultimate objective of \nthe IRS, it appears, is to force paperboys to become employees of daily \nnewspapers.\n  Mr. President, in the grand scheme of things this is not a very \nimportant issue. But I was once a paperboy--I threw 106 newspapers--and \nfor the life of me, I cannot understand why the IRS wants to destroy a \nsystem which allows literally hundreds of thousands of young people, \nboth boys and girls, to be independent businesspeople.\n  If the IRS had its way, it would raise the cost of having a daily \nnewspaper delivered to your door and it would destroy an opportunity \nthat has been part of the American system of small business since \nalmost the colonial period. In my opinion, the negative impact of this \napproach goes far beyond newspapers and the cost to those who read \nthem.\n  Let me make the point as succinctly as I can: I am trained as an \neconomist, and at some point in my career I became interested in \nvarious historic economic periods in America, the greenback and free \nsilver movement period, and other periods in the 18th and 19th \ncenturies. One of the things which I discovered was that people in the \n18th and 19th centuries, for some unexplainable reason, understood \neconomics and understood how our economy works much better than \neducated people do today.\n  After having looked at this, I concluded that the reason this was so \nis that in the world of the 18th and 19th centuries--when most people \nwere farmers or independent businesspeople--most people actually bought \nthings, produced things, and sold things. They were both buyers and \nsellers in the market at the same time, and because of this, just \ncarrying on their daily business provided a tremendous educational \nexperience for them about how this great economic system works.\n  Today, when people graduate from college, they go to work for some \nbig company or for the Government, and for most of their lives they \nspecialize in one particular field. They may buy things, they may sell \nthings, they may produce things, or they may even deal with the huge \npaperwork and litigation trail that often goes with it--but very few \npeople in America today are actually engaged in all facets of any \nbusiness.\n  One of the reasons that I have taken on this paperboy issue with a \nvery strong commitment and zeal is that being a paperboy is one of the \nlast jobs left where young people are actually in business for \nthemselves. They buy their newspapers from the newspaper and then sell \nit to their customers. I bought 106 copies of the Ledger-Enquirer from \nthe local newspaper and delivered it to 106 residences and businesses. \nI collected the money, as literally millions of paperboys have done \nsince the colonial period, and in the process not only did I earn \nmoney, but I learned about how our market system works. I think it is \nvitally important that we not let the Internal Revenue Service destroy \nthis great educational and business system that is available to young \npeople all over America. So I have championed this provision in the \nbill that says to the Internal Revenue Service, get out of the paperboy \nbusiness. Let paperboys be independent businesspeople. Stop challenging \ntheir independent status. Do not destroy a great American institution \nwhich not only brings the newspaper to our home at 6 o'clock in the \nmorning, at a very low price, but also is a great business and learning \nopportunity for the young people of this country.\n  So I am very proud of this provision. Is it going to change the \nworld? No. But for hundreds of thousands of young people all over \nAmerica, it is going to preserve their opportunity to be an independent \nbusinessperson. It is going to preserve a great American institution \nand it is going to tell the Internal Revenue Service to go make war on \nsomebody else and leave America's paperboys alone.\n  The third provision in the bill that I want to talk about is the \nresearch and development tax credit. This credit came into place in \n1981 in an effort to try to encourage American businesses to invest in \nresearch and development. If I had the chart with me that I have used \naround the country, I could show that in every single year since 1970 \nJapan and Germany have invested a higher percentage of their gross \ndomestic product in nondefense R than has the United States of \nAmerica.\n\n  We need more research and development if we want to produce the \nproducts of the 21st century, if we want to be competitive in the world \nmarket. If we really want higher wages in this country, we should not \nsimply just mandate them in Congress, we should promote investment in \nresearch and development. We should promote investments which develop \nnew products, which develop new tools, and which develop new ways of \ndoing things. We need to be the leader of the world in science and \ntechnology, and extending the R tax credit is a critical part of that \neffort.\n  Quite frankly, Mr. President, I am disappointed that we are only \nextending the R tax credit for 18 months. This tax credit should be \nmade permanent because people need to know with certainty that if they \nundertake a long-term R project--that if they try to bring a new \nproduct on to the market, or to develop new tools and new techniques, \nor to bring the power of science to the farm and to the factory--that \nthere will be a consistent and favorable tax policy.\n  The R tax credit is broadly supported on both sides of the aisle. I \nthink it is absolutely imperative that we adopt this bill and put the \ncredit back into place, and eventually I want to make it permanent. \nThis business of taking important features in the tax structure and \nevery 6 months or every year going through the process of re-debating \nit creates uncertainty and it greatly reduces the positive benefit to \nthe country of long-term research, development, and experimentation \nexpenditures by private businesses. So I think it is imperative that we \nmake this tax credit permanent. I am pleased that we are reinstituting \nit. I see it as a positive step forward, but I do not think we are \ngoing far enough.\n  One final issue: Senator Hutchison has sponsored, and I have \ncosponsored, a bill to eliminate a terrible inequity in the Tax Code. \nAnd that terrible inequity is that if you work outside your home and \nthe company you work for does not have a private retirement program, \nyou can put up to $2,000 a year tax free into an individual retirement \naccount. If, however, you decide to stay at home and raise your \nchildren and be what is traditionally called a homemaker, you lose the \nability to put $2,000 a year into your individual retirement account.\n  I believe, and Senator Hutchison believes, that the Tax Code \ndiscriminates against people who decide to stay at home to raise their \nchildren and to provide for their family.\n  I want to make it very clear that neither Senator Hutchison nor I are \ntrying to make a value judgment here as to what people should do. My \nmama worked all during my childhood because she had to. My wife has \nworked because she wanted to. But the point is this, the Tax Code \nshould not discriminate against people based on whether they make a \ndecision to work outside their home or inside their home.\n  The provision that is in our bill makes it so that regardless of \nwhether a person decides to take a job in the economy or whether they \ndecide to stay, and work, in their home and to raise their children, \nthey have the equal right to provide for their retirement and to \nprovide for their individual security.\n  Under this provision we will let a homemaker, as well as someone who \nworks outside the home, set up an individual retirement account, and we \nwill allow them to put up to $2,000 a year tax free into that account. \nThe net result will be to strengthen families and\n\n[[Page S7428]]\n\nto allow people who stay at home and raise their children to build up a \nretirement program like other people can. We will be eliminating an \nantifamily element in the Tax Code, and, therefore, I think this is an \nimportant provision.\n  I am equally committed to the goal of trying to expand what people \ncan use individual retirement accounts for. Last year, we were \nsuccessful in both Houses of Congress in opening up individual \nretirement accounts to allow them to be used to build up a nest egg for \na downpayment on a first home, to be used for college tuition, and to \nbe used for major medical expenses. I think this is an important step \nin creating a lifelong saving program which will not only expand \nnational savings and enrich the country in the process, but will make \nit easier for people to prepare financially for the expenditures that \nthey are going to have to face during their lifetimes. In making it \neasier to save, we will make families stronger, we will make people \nmore secure, and we will spread happiness, which is the only legitimate \naim of a free government.\n\n  I am afraid that with all of our efforts here to defy logic and \neconomics and to repeal the laws of supply and demand that we are going \nto forget that there are other provisions being voted on today. \nIndividually, they do not represent Earth-changing policy, but getting \nthe IRS out of the business of trying to force the Farm Bureau to pay \ntaxes on dues, getting the IRS out of the business of trying to destroy \nthe independent contractor status of paper boys, extending the R tax \ncredit, and letting homemakers have the same right to build up \nretirement that those who choose to work outside the home have are all \nimportant changes in tax policy.\n  I think these changes will be beneficial to the country as a whole as \nwell as to the individuals who are directly affected. I want to thank \nour chairman for his leadership on this bill and for allowing \nindividual Members who care strongly about these small issues, which \noften end up falling through the cracks, to get them into this bill. I \nyield the floor.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I congratulate the Senator from Texas \nfor a very careful exposition. I think this is perhaps the first time \nhe has been on the floor as a member of the Committee on Finance.\n  As many academic theories go, there are problems sometimes with \nreality. This Senator from New York at age 12 was a paperboy. He had \nlearned if at 9 o'clock at night you bought 10 copies of the Daily News \nand 5 copies of the Daily Mirror at 96th Street and Broadway and then \nsold them in places of entertainment along Amsterdam Avenue, if you \nbought them for 2 cents and you sold them for 5, you had a profit of \n150 percent capital that very day. I knew all of this by the age of 13. \nSomehow by age 16 I had forgotten it entirely. And here I am, looking \nfor Social Security. That is why I insist Social Security will be \nthere.\n  Thanking the Senator, I have the honor to yield 8 minutes to the \ndistinguished Senator from Minnesota.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota is recognized.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. The Democratic minimum wage amendment that is pending \nwhich I cosponsored is simple and straightforward. It would increase \nthe Federal minimum wage from $4.25 an hour to $5.15 an hour. That is \n90 cents over 2 years, not even indexed for inflation.\n  Mr. President, the increase in the minimum wage for our Nation for \nworking families in our Nation is a matter of simple justice. Mr. \nPresident, the Republican alternative to this bill is in many ways, I \nthink, worse than the House-passed bill. It is certainly not a step \nforward; rather, it is a great leap backward. First of all, Mr. \nPresident, the Republican amendment argues that a family would not \nreceive a raise until January 1, 1997. That would deny people an extra \n$500. That is important. We want this minimum wage to take effect right \nnow. For people who have significant wages, for people who have \nsignificant incomes, $500 may not seem like much, but for many \nfamilies, for many wage earners who just make a little bit over $8,000 \na year, that additional $500 is a difference that makes a difference.\n\n  Second of all, the Republican alternative would create a subminimum \nwage that would apply to all workers regardless of age for a 6-month \nperiod. Mr. President, this particular part of their alternative I find \nto be egregious. I know of no other word. In other words, we are saying \nthere will be a 8-month period for wage earners, regardless of age, \nregardless of experience, regardless of background. They call this an \nopportunity wage. I, instead, call it an exploitation wage. It to me \nmakes no sense at all. You are 55 years of age, you have been \ndownsized, you had a good job, and you are saying through this \namendment, that as a matter of fact, people who have been downsized now \nhave to start out at $4.25 an hour, and for 6 months work at that. They \ncannot even receive $5.15 an hour. Mr. President, for a 55-year-old \nout-of-work steelworker in Hibbing, MN, that is not justice. For a 38-\nyear-old waitress in Sauk Centre, that is not justice. For a 27-year-\nold young man working in a grocery store in Rochester, that is not \njustice.\n  To make the argument that is not just teenagers, it is everybody, \nregardless of their age, regardless of their experience, that for 6 \nmonths they make $4.25 an hour, not even $5.15 an hour, I think, is no \nless than a scandal.\n  Finally, Mr. President, the exemption, the small business exemption, \nis unprecedented, it is unnecessary, it creates a two-tier wage \nstructure, and about half of the 10 million or so wage earners and \nfamilies that would be benefited by this would no longer benefit.\n  Mr. President, when I look at this alternative and I look at all of \nthe exemptions, I look at all the delays, and all of the rest of it, it \nis hard to determine under the Republican alternative, who, if anyone, \nwould actually receive an increase even if their bill was to become \nlaw. There are so many loopholes and so many exemptions to the Bond \nalternative that after all is said and done, if it was passed, it is \nhard to even figure out who would actually receive an increase.\n  Mr. President, we should have no illusions about this on the floor of \nthe Senate. Justice delayed is justice denied, and the Bond amendment \ndoes not represent a step forward.\n  Mr. President, I would like to talk about this minimum wage debate \nand this vote, which I think is a historic vote on the floor of the \nSenate, in a national context and in a family context. I do not think \nthis is a vote really about the minimum wage. I think it is about more \nthan a minimum wage. For the vast majority of Minnesota families and \nfamilies in this country, they view this as providing a foothold into \nthe middle class. Over 50 percent of the minimum wage workers are \nadults, they are not teenagers. Over 60 percent of the minimum wage \nworkers are women, and for these women and these men and their \nfamilies, an additional $1,800 is a difference that makes a difference. \nIt means you can buy the groceries and put food on the table. In a cold \nweather State like Minnesota you can pay the heating bill. You might be \nable to afford your tuition at a community college.\n\n  Mr. President, this is not about just the minimum wage. It is more \nimportant than the minimum wage. This is about the squeeze that \nfamilies feel. This is about the concerns that people have that their \nchildren in their twenties cannot find employment that they can count \non. That is to say, a job that pays a decent wage. This is about the \nconcern that people have that they cannot afford to send their kids to \ncollege. This is about the concern that people have that they cannot \nmake ends meet. This minimum wage amendment that we have introduced \nrepresents a step forward for our country. Justice delayed is justice \ndenied. The Bond alternative does not represent a step forward, Mr. \nPresident. It represents a step backward.\n  Now, I will not go through the whole political economy debate but I \nwill make two final points. Point one, you look at Salomon Bros. report \non this and they say if you raise the minimum wage you have people who \ncan consume more and the economy does better and it creates more jobs, \nand then you have 100 economists that signed the letter, including a \nNobel laureate economist, and they say this is a modest increase, it \nwill not lead to a decrease in jobs. We use to have bipartisan support \nfor raising the minimum wage. We used to believe it was the right thing \nto do. We\n\n[[Page S7429]]\n\nused to believe it was a matter of fairness and justice. We should pass \nthis minimum wage in its strongest form.\n  Mr. President, the National Retail Federation, in talking about the \nBond amendment said, ``Passing the Bond amendment is probably our best \nchance to kill the minimum wage increase.'' ``Passing the Bond \namendment is probably our best chance to kill the minimum wage \nincrease.''\n  Senators, colleagues, if you vote for this amendment, that is what \nyou are doing. You are killing the minimum wage increase. There are so \nmany exemptions built into it and so many loopholes that all of the \nwage earners and all of the families that could benefit will not be \nable to benefit. We are not going to be able to fool anybody. You \ncannot duck and run. You cannot hide. You cannot duck for cover. You \ncannot look for a political cover vote--and that is what this amendment \nis.\n  We should vote for this minimum wage. It is long overdue. It is the \nright thing to do. I hope that there will be very strong support for \nit.\n  Mr. President, let me just finish on a somewhat different note and \njust reference some of the remarks that my colleague from Illinois is \ngoing to make.\n  I am concerned with the managers' amendment. We now just had a chance \nto see the specifics. It is very long, very involved, and there are a \nnumber of provisions in this amendment that I am extremely concerned \nabout.\n  My colleague from Illinois I might ask very briefly to speak about an \nimportant Supreme Court decision and what is in this managers' \namendment.\n  Mr. SIMON. Yes. There are a number of things. I thank my colleague \nfor yielding.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is advised that the time has \nexpired.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. GRAMM. I yield 10 minutes to the distinguished Senator from \nMissouri.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I wonder whether I might ask unanimous consent for 1 \nmore minute so my colleague can finish this.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, if we could amend the unanimous-consent \nrequest so that the distinguished Senator from Minnesota has 1 more \nminute but at the expiration of that minute the distinguished Senator \nfrom Missouri be recognized for 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I thank my colleague.\n  Mr. SIMON. I thank my colleague. There are several provisions in \nhere.\n  First of all, ESOP's--we take away the advantage. We have always said \nESOP's are a good thing. Now we retreat on that. Harris Trust is a \nprovision that protects the pension funds. I do not know how much is at \nstake here; $300 billion is one figure. I heard $500 billion, another \nfigure.\n  This complicated thing we are acting on without a hearing. I do not \nthink it makes sense.\n  Then, finally, we are changing the small business provisions on \n401(k) plans so that highly compensated executives will have advantages \nover those of lesser incomes.\n  I think the managers' amendment is a very bad amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri is recognized.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  I am pleased to have this opportunity to participate in the debate \nthat relates to the compensation levels received by American workers. \nIt is an important debate, in my judgment, because it allows us to \naddress the problem which is understood by people across the political \nspectrum and around the country.\n  The fact is that take-home pay has declined by 6.3 percent since its \n1989 level. Americans' tax burden has been going up while their take-\nhome pay has been going down. Currently, we charge people more for \ngovernment than we have at any other time in history. That troubles me. \nAmericans spend more on taxes than they do on food, clothing and \nshelter combined.\n  This concept of wage stagnation, of the flatness of wages, has really \ncaused the American people to be troubled. The Senator from Minnesota, \nSenator Wellstone, recently--in fact, just a few moments ago--talked \nabout the fact that families are struggling to make ends meet, are \nworrying about how they get their kids to college, are worrying about \nbeing able to move into the work force and are worrying about getting \nthe kind of experience which is necessary in order to become \nproductive, long-term workers in our economy.\n  So I think there is an important condition to be addressed. It is a \ncondition of wage stagnation, of a flatness in terms of take-home pay.\n  As I spent the last couple of weeks, or almost a couple of weeks, \nhome in Missouri, I worked with workers side by side. I worked with a \ngroup of workers in the Eagle Pitcher Corp. which manufactures \nbatteries for use in satellites. I did assembly line jobs and those \nworkers are concerned about their take-home pay. I worked in the food \nservice industry. And, yes, those workers are concerned there about \ntheir take-home pay. One day I worked in the apparel industry--in \nmanufacturing of clothing and uniforms. And those workers also are \nconcerned about their take-home pay.\n  While individuals are concerned about their take-home pay--none \nmentioned an increase in the minimum wage. They understand that the \nminimum wage is something that would address only between 4 and 5 \nmillion people in this country, and many of those individuals are not \nfull-time workers.\n  I think we need to address this problem of wage stagnation far more \nsubstantially than we would if we were to increase the minimum wage.\n  There are problems attendant with increasing the minimum wage which \nwould intensify the economic difficulty for individuals, not relieve \nit. For instance, the Congressional Budget Office indicates that a 90-\ncent increase would create employment losses in the country from \n100,000 to up to 500,000 jobs lost. I do not think we want to craft \nrelief that will cause a significant number of American workers to lose \ntheir jobs.\n  Seventy-seven percent of the American Economists Association \nresponded that a minimum wage increase would have job losses that are \nsubstantial.\n  Even the Democratic Leadership Council opposes a minimum wage \nincrease. Even the Clinton administration understands this concept. \nSecretary Reich, in a letter to President Clinton, dated July 20, 1993, \nwrote: ``A full assessment of where to set the minimum wage should \nconsider a wide range of factors beyond its income effects on the \nworking poor. After all, most minimum wage workers are not poor.''\n  So if we really want to try to increase the take-home pay for \nindividuals, I do not think the minimum wage is a very good way to do \nit.\n  First, many of those who are on the minimum wage are not poor people. \nAbout 57 percent of these workers are in households with income of over \n$45,000.\n  Second, we do not want to shrink the job base for this country in the \nprocess of helping people.\n  So what kinds of alternatives are there for helping people with flat \nwages which also do not shrink the job base but grow the job base, \nwhich do not just address 4 to 5 million people but address 70 or 80 \nmillion people? What are the kinds of things that we can do to provide \nrelief that really would help families--generally--across the board, \nrather than focus on less than 5 percent of the American work force?\n\n  I believe that there is such an opportunity, and I have offered it in \nthe U.S. Senate. Almost all of the individuals who speak so eloquently \nin favor of the minimum wage voted against this proposal. But the truth \nof the matter is this proposal would help almost 80 million workers \ninstead of 4 million workers. It is something that would grow the job \nbase of the United States by a half million jobs instead of shrink it \nby a half a million jobs.\n  It would be something that would allow a broad base of Americans to \nhave more take-home pay rather than just helping a few. It is this--\nright now, as Americans pay more in taxes than we have ever paid in \nhistory, we pay double taxes on the Social Security taxes which we have \ndeducted from our paychecks. It is money we never see.\n\n[[Page S7430]]\n\n  The money actually is taken by our employer and sent to the \nGovernment. It is the Social Security tax of 6.2 percent of our income. \nThen we are later charged income tax on that same tax which we have \nalready paid.\n  If we were to allow this tax to be deductible to ordinary workers \nlike it is deductible to corporations which pay the other half of the \nSocial Security tax, we would have a $1,770 impact on the average two-\nearner working family, and that would benefit 77 million-plus workers \ninstead of 4 million-plus workers. It seems to me, if we want to \naddress this challenge in our culture, which has recognized the \nflatness in take-home pay, we ought to do it on a broad base for \nAmericans rather than a narrow base, and we ought to do it in a way \nthat grows this economy rather than stunts the economy.\n  As the economists have indicated, a mandated increase in the minimum \nwage could result in up to 500,000 jobs lost. However, the economists \nhave indicated there would be 500,000 jobs gained if we were to provide \nthis kind of tax relief to American families.\n  I think we ought to find ways to grow ourselves into helping people \nout of wage stagnation rather than stunt the economy and hope there \nwould be those who would benefit as a result, in spite of the fact we \nhad substantial job losses. The reasons are substantial to provide \ndeductibility of our Social Security taxes which we pay from our income \ntaxes.\n  First, it is necessary to eliminate this double taxation on American \nfamilies.\n  Second, corporations which pay the other 6.2 percent of a person's \nearnings in order to make the total combined 12.4 percent of earnings, \ndeduct their share--yet, the average worker cannot deduct their share. \nThis fundamental lack of fairness, this disparity in tax treatment \nbetween the corporate side and the individual side should be resolved.\n  Finally, if we really want to help American workers. We ought to be \nlooking out for workers generally rather than a very small segment of \nworkers, many of whom are only part-time employees. Many of whom are \nthe youngsters like my children. They began work in the fast food \nindustry. Well, some 40 years ago I began work in the fast food \nindustry myself, or at least in the ice cream industry. I do not think \nthere was really fast food in those days. But I think we ought to find \na way to help American families generally, and we can help American \nfamilies generally by providing tax relief for American families \ngenerally. It is tax equity because it would give the American family \nthe same tax break that the American corporation enjoys. It would be \ntax fairness because it would stop a double taxation on American \nfamilies. And it would help grow the economy rather than slow the \neconomy, which is the way we ought to try to move people ahead in terms \nof their own wages.\n  That ought to really be the focus of our endeavor. We ought to try to \nbenefit families generally. We ought to try to provide help and \nassistance to the 70 or 80 million wage earners that could be assisted \nfrom this proposal rather than limit our assistance to the 4 million or \nso individuals who are involved in the minimum wage category.\n  I believe there has been an appropriate recognition, a diagnosis, if \nyou will, of a discomfort in the American body politic. The diagnosis \nis for wage stagnation. I believe we can remedy that by providing tax \nrelief for American families generally, rather than seeking to focus \nour efforts on a very small segment of the American population.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Campbell). The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, if my time has not been consumed, I \nwould reserve the remainder.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I yield 8 minutes to the distinguished \nSenator from California.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California is recognized for \n8 minutes.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I thank the Chair. I thank very much Senator Moynihan who \nhas been working so hard to put together a measure this body can pass \nand feel good about. I thank him specifically for helping us with some \nvery important provisions dealing with pension protection for widows. \nWithout going into those details, I see that it has been included in \nthe managers' amendment, and I am very grateful because what happens \nmany times, I say to my friend, is that when a person loses a spouse--\nin this particular case I am talking about, it is usually a woman left \nin a circumstance where the pension that they were receiving together \ndrops from 100 to 50 percent, and there are ways to fix that so the \ncouple gets two-thirds in pension, so that there is no dropoff after a \ndeath. What we have been saying is that this option ought to be \navailable, and the committee, on a bipartisan basis, has recognized \nthis, and I am grateful to all sides on that.\n\n  On the other issue about which I rise to speak, I am not as pleased \nbecause I am worried. I am worried that while we take up the minimum \nwage, there will be enough votes to carry what I consider to be an \negregious loophole, and I think if it does pass--and I am very hopeful \nit will not--what we will be doing here today really is more of a sham, \nbecause we have information which says that if the Bond amendment \npasses--and I know my friend from Missouri really believes it is the \nright thing to do, and I respect his view; I just do not happen to \nagree with it--if the Bond amendment would pass, 50 percent of those \nwho would get a minimum wage increase would not get that increase.\n  I think that would be a little bit akin to going to a birthday party \nfor twins, and you can imagine two little children 6 years old, 7 years \nold, and you give a gift to one and nothing to the other. I do not \nthink anyone in America would do that. I do not think we should treat \nour working people that way. Simply because one works for a large \ncorporation and another for a small should not mean that we punish the \none who works for a small corporation. By the way, the definition of \nsuch a corporation is $500,000 in business, which is not exactly a mom \nand pop operation. And so I am worried about this vote today. I am \nexcited, frankly, that we finally come to the point where we have a \nchance to vote for a clean minimum wage. I am not so sure the body will \ndo so.\n  Really, the question today is whether there will be a straightforward \nincrease in the minimum wage, which is at a 40-year low. That increase \nwill go soon to the people at the bottom of the economic ladder that my \nfriend from Massachusetts, Senator Kennedy, I think, has described so \nwell--who these people are and what they do. They are at the very \nbottom of the American economic ladder. They work very hard. They earn \nwell below the poverty level. We are calling for a slim dime-an-hour \nincrease for those people over 2 years--over 2 years. I think we ought \nto just do that the way we have done it in the past.\n  Again, the Senator from Massachusetts has pointed out that under \nPresident Nixon we have done it, under President Bush we have done it, \nunder President Kennedy we have done it, under President Carter we have \ndone it, and we really did not set up a two-tiered permanent system. We \nnever did that before. We should not do it now. We have never set up a \nsubminimum wage. We have never done that before. We should not do that \nnow.\n  I just want to point out to my colleagues that the issue of the \nminimum wage in many ways is about people who are struggling to earn \nmoney for their families, and many of them are women. As a matter of \nfact, most of the people on the minimum wage are adults, and most of \nthose are women.\n  There is a particularly egregious part of the Bond amendment that I \nhope Members will look at and vote against. That has to do with those \nworkers at the bottom of the ladder who count on tips--in other words, \nwaitresses and waiters and others. Now, again, these are the people who \nwork with the sweat of their brow, and they go home at night and they \ncan barely stand on their feet. I want you to know that 80 percent of \nthose people are women. They are women. What we are going to do here is \nfreeze in their minimum wage because, under the current law, people who \ncount on tips get half the minimum wage. Actually, it used to be 60 \npercent, but we changed that in the 1980's. They get half the minimum \nwage and then they get their tips to\n\n[[Page S7431]]\n\ncompensate. In the Bond amendment we freeze that at the current half of \nthe current minimum wage, and therefore those folks are frozen in place \nand they are going to go down the economic ladder.\n\n  Why would we do that when we have a chance today to send a message, \nRepublicans and Democrats alike, that we think everybody ought to be \nbrought along in this economic recovery? We hear there is good news out \nthere. There is good news out there. There is more to be done, but we \nare seeing that unemployment rate go down.\n  So my message here this morning is this: Why do we not just do the \nright thing? Just do it. Just vote for an increase in the minimum wage \nthe way we have done for so many years. And this argument that, oh, \njobs will be lost and it will be inflationary--if we had that attitude \nwe would still have people working for 50 cents an hour. If we truly \nbelieved that every single minimum wage increase was going to bring \nloss of jobs we never would have increased the minimum wage. Why do we \nnot do the right thing today?\n  Mr. President, I hope we will defeat the Bond amendment and pass a \nclean increase in the minimum wage.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. I thank the Senator from California.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM. Mr. President, I yield 10 minutes to the Senator from \nUtah.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah, [Mr. Bennett], is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, one of the things that continues to amaze \nme in my service in the Senate is how we, in this body, spend all of \nour time projecting and conjecturing about the future and not much time \nlooking at the past in an attempt to find out if there is a model that \ncan give us a more sure understanding of the future than the \nprojections of professional pundits and economists. In this debate on \nminimum wage, we do have a clear model from the past which illustrates \nwhat happens when the minimum wage is raised. I want to spend some time \nthis morning talking about this model.\n  By coincidence, the best summary of this model appeared in this \nmorning's New York Times. Under the headline, ``Thesis, Rise in Wages \nWill Hurt Teenage Group,'' we have the following:\n\n       At one time, Sidewinder Pumps Inc., in Lafayette, La., \n     would hire a dozen or more young people to work each summer \n     at minimum-wage jobs like weeding or expanding the parking \n     lot--tasks that were not really essential to the company but \n     that let it give teenagers a taste of what paid work is like.\n       When the Federal minimum wage went up in the early 1990s, \n     the company cut back to three or four summer workers. And \n     this year the prospect of another increase led the company to \n     end this quarter-century tradition.\n\n  The last time Congress raised the minimum wage this company cut back \nthe number of minimum wage earners. Now, some are proposing to raise \nfurther the minimum wage and this company is now eliminating more jobs. \nThis situation is not theory, but actual experience, actual practice.\n  The article goes on to give us some statistics:\n\n       In March 1990, just before the Federal Government raised \n     the minimum to $3.80 from $3.35, 47.1 percent of teen-agers \n     had jobs, but that promptly began a slide that carried it \n     down to less than 43 percent a year later, when the $4.25 \n     wage kicked in. The figure then tumbled to 39.8 percent by \n     June 1992 before slowly recovering to 43.2 percent now.\n       ``The timing of the drop in teen-age employment is \n     absolutely coincident with the increase in the minimum, \n     whereas for other groups the recession's bite was delayed,'' \n     declared Finis Welch, an economics professor at Texas A \n     University and a prominent student of the subject.\n\n  In other words, the last time the minimum wage was raised, the group \nthat was hurt the most, in terms of unemployment, statistically and \nhistorically, was teenagers. The article states:\n\n       Black teenagers, often most in need of basic job skills, \n     fared even worse. At the beginning of 1990, 28.8 percent of \n     this group held jobs. But lack of hiring and dismissals drove \n     this down to 22.5 percent by January 1991 and to a low of \n     20.4 percent in August 1991. Not until April 1996 did it \n     recover to 28 percent.\n\n  In other words, they started out at 28 percent. The minimum wage was \nraised, and black teenagers saw employment go all the way down to 20 \npercent. It has taken 6 years to get back to 28 percent. And now some \nwant to again raise the minimum wage so that black teenagers can see \ntheir employment go back down, the way it did the last time the minimum \nwage was raised.\n  The article continues:\n\n       ``Teenagers shouldered a disproportionate share of the \n     burden'' even after allowing for their ranks contracting from \n     demographic trends, said Erich Heinemann, an economist at \n     Brimberg & Co., a Wall Street firm. ``To a very significant \n     degree,'' he added, ``the 1990-1991 recession was a teenage \n     recession.''\n\n  The article summarizes:\n\n       [Some have] found the 1990-91 experience persuasive.\n       ``The last increase turned out to be a cruel joke for low-\n     skilled teenage workers,'' he declared. ``To the extent that \n     the minimum is raised high enough to positively affect wage \n     levels,'' he contended, ``it will negatively affect the \n     demand for labor.''\n\n  Like many in this body, I worked as a teenager. I started out when \nthe minimum wage was 40 cents. You do not earn a lot of money at 40 \ncents an hour. Frankly, the money was not the most important reason for \nme to work. It seemed important at the time, in fact, it seemed like a \ntremendous boon to me because I was earning more money than I received \nin allowance from my parents. But looking back on it, the most \nimportant thing I gained from working at age 14, was the experience of \ngoing to work: Showing up on time, staying the full work period whether \nI was bored or not, punching out at the proper time, dressing in proper \nattire--the kinds of experiences which I find far more valuable than \nthe money. We are denying these experiences to more and more teenagers \nwhen we raise the minimum wage. Fortunately, the amendment by the \nSenator from Missouri will allow many teenagers to continue to have the \nwork experience that this Senator had when he was a teenager.\n  For me, the lessons learned from the last increase in the minimum \nwage are persuasive. We should learn from the past. We should learn \nfrom what happened last time and be very, very careful about raising it \nthis time.\n  At the risk of sounding more demagogic than I would like, I say to \nteenagers who lose their jobs, to black teenagers who see a repetition \nof what happened in 1990-91 when they appealed, ``Where did the jobs \ngo,'' the answer might be, ``Talk to the senior Senator from \nMassachusetts. In the name of trying to help you, he has fashioned a \nprogram that has destroyed your jobs.''\n  I know the Senator from Massachusetts does not have that motive. I \nknow he is acting out of the best of intentions. But I say that past \nexperience in raising the minimum wage indicates that history will \nrepeat itself and we will again see jobs lost. I plead with the senior \nSenator from Massachusetts in the name of the teenagers whose jobs will \nbe destroyed, to examine past history and do his best to see to it that \nwe do not repeat the mistakes made 6 years ago.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I am happy to yield 8 minutes to the \njunior Senator from Massachusetts.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts, [Mr. Kerry], \nis recognized for 8 minutes.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, thank you very much. I thank the Senator \nfrom New York.\n  Mr. President, let me address some of the concerns that were just \nraised by the Senator in Utah. The facts show that through the years, \nthere may be individual instances where there is a tailoff in the \nnumbers of teenagers who might be hired by a particular company but, \nbroadly speaking, the number of teenagers who are helped by the \nincrease in the wage is much greater. The fact is that any company that \nrequires a certain amount of work to be done is going to pay somebody a \nwage to do that work that they want to get done. They are not just \nhiring teenagers as a matter of altruism.\n  Generally speaking, we in the U.S. Congress have recognized our \nresponsibility to make up for that gap so that teenagers have the very \nopportunity that the Senator from Utah talks about. That is why \nhistorically we have had a Summer Jobs Program, until our Republican \nfriends in recent years have seen fit to zero it out--zero it out.\n\n[[Page S7432]]\n\n  The basic issue here remains the same: What are we willing to give in \nAmerica as the value of an hour's work? We decided that in the late \n1930's, and under every President since then, Republican or Democrat \nalike, with Republican votes and Democratic votes--we have raised the \nminimum wage. And with what impact, Mr. President? With the impact that \nunemployment has gone down and the wages of more Americans have at \nleast come up closer to the poverty level.\n  My friend from Texas earlier said we should not monkey with supply \nand demand. But this is the same Senator who is down here voting to \npreserve the wool and mohair subsidy. If that is not monkeying with \nsupply and demand, not to mention all of the pages in here of different \ntax provisions, subchapter S provisions, depreciation allowances--we \nmonkey with it every single day. The question is, For what social \npurpose do we do that?\n  The fundamental issue before the U.S. Senate is, for people who work \nhard and play by the rules, do they deserve a raise? Not a handout--a \nhelping hand up, yes, but not a handout. The way you send that message \nis to value the work with a living wage.\n  We have done that before, Democrats and Republicans alike. We have \nraised the minimum wage closer to the poverty line, not a great level, \nbut that is what we feel we can do in the best balance against job loss \nand other market forces.\n  I acknowledge there are market forces. We do not want to monkey with \nthe level that is so high that you would, in fact, generate enormous \nunemployment. But the proposed increase would not put our country in \ndanger of reaching that level.\n  In Vermont and Massachusetts, we raised the minimum wage at the \nbeginning of this year. New Hampshire and New York refused to raise the \nminimum wage. Unemployment in Massachusetts and Vermont went down. \nUnemployment in New York went up and New Hampshire went up.\n  Mr. President, it is clear historically that raising the minimum wage \nmay create minor dislocations. My friend talks about one company laying \noff five people in this article in the New York Times. Five people who \nare kids, teenagers at the minimum wage, let's say 8 weeks of \nemployment, if they take some time off in the summer, is $288. So we \nare now being told that a company is going to deny a teenager $288 for \n8 weeks of work. It is hard for me to believe that if that job was \nnecessary, that company is not going to produce enough product or sell \nenough goods to make up $288 for a teenager to work. What we need is a \nlittle more ethic in America where our corporations understand an \nobligation to try to hire teenagers, to try to pay people a decent \nwage.\n  We know the statistics. We are living in a country that now has the \nthird highest number of poor children since 1964. Two-thirds of the \npeople on the minimum wage are adults, not teenagers, and most of them \nare women. In my State of Massachusetts, almost 5 percent of the \nchildren in Massachusetts live in families where at least one parent \nworks full-time but the family still lives below the poverty line. \nNationally, more than 2 million children live in families which would \nget a raise if the minimum wage is increased to $5.15 an hour.\n\n  The question is, should these children and their families get an \nincrease in the minimum wage, and should the Congress fill the gap to \nhelp those teenagers have a summer job? Then everybody benefits \ncorrectly and we do not create a Hobson's choice of denying both of \nthem everything: No summer jobs and no minimum wage, and the country \ncan get poorer together. That is really what we are talking about here.\n  We have heard this argument year in and year out. We keep hearing it: \n``Oh, if you raise the minimum wage, America isn't going to get \nstronger.''\n  From 1938 to now, look at the number of jobs we have created, look at \nthe increased strength in America, look at the stock market go up. Last \nyear, the stock market went up 34 percent in 1 year, and corporations \ntook record profits. But the consumer debt in America went up. The \nconsumer debt in America is at the highest level in history.\n  So we are going to vote today on whether or not someone at the bottom \nof the economic ladder who has seen their income decline and their \nwages decline in the last years is going to get an opportunity to work \nfor less than three-quarters of the rate of poverty.\n  If you work at the minimum wage in America a 40-hour week, 52 weeks a \nyear, you earn $8,500 a year. Try and live on that. The poverty level \nfor a family of four is $16,000 a year. The poverty level for a family \nof three is $12,500. Can we not even find it in our capacity, where we \nhave the most expensive, rich pensions in American history, where we \nhave a salary--all of us --at $130,000 a year, to raise the minimum \nwage for people working at the bottom of the economic ladder? That is \nthe test of the conscience of the Senate today.\n  The efforts of the Republicans to come in with an exemption for two-\nthirds of the companies in this country is wrong. In combination with \nthe rest of their amendment, one-half of the people working for the \nminimum wage would be denied an increase. This is a vote over right and \nwrong, and I think history has proven that it is right to raise the \nminimum wage.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM. Mr. President, I yield 10 minutes to the senior \nSenator from Colorado, Senator Brown.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado, Senator Brown, is \nrecognized for 10 minutes.\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Kansas for her \nkindness in yielding time.\n  We are debating today as if one side is in favor of raising wages and \nthe other is not. With all due respect to my dear colleagues, I suggest \nthat is not the question. Both sides are in favor of wages going up. As \na matter of fact, anyone who serves in the U.S. Congress, ought to have \nat the center of what they are here for an effort to promote and \nimprove the lives and the compensation of the working men and women of \nAmerica.\n  However, there is a real and a legitimate difference of opinion about \nhow you increase wages, and compensation. Many of my colleagues \nsincerely believe Government is the way to set prices for products and \nservices in an economy. But let me point out that countries that have \ntaken that philosophy to an extreme, that have put that philosophy into \neffect in a broad range of both services and goods in a market have had \ndisasters. There is no question as to why countries have abandoned \nsocialism across the world. They have abandoned it because it is a \ndisaster.\n  The real price-setting mechanism that is efficient and productive and \nperhaps most carried, in terms of job opportunities, is a market \nsystem. To suggest the Government is the right one to determine the \nright wage for every individual is absurd.\n  Perhaps some will vote for this because it does a little damage, and \nI think in some areas that is probably true. But the problem with it is \nthis says more than simply set a wage; it says it is illegal for \nsomeone to work a job that pays under a certain amount, even if that \nperson wants to. It becomes illegal for you to take that job even if \nthere is no other job available.\n\n  I hope Members will take a look at who this legislation impacts. We \nhave heard the passionate rhetoric from people, many of whom have never \nheld a minimum wage job in their lives. I think sometimes you can be \nmore impassioned when you have not had that opportunity. But, Mr. \nPresident, the ones who are primarily affected are not necessarily \nfour-member families. The ones who are primarily affected are people \nwho are getting their first job, oftentimes teenagers. Do we want them \nto do better? Absolutely. But no one should vote on this measure \nwithout realizing what its impact is going to be.\n  I look back on the jobs that I had as I grew up. I think of them \nbecause they were very, very important in helping me understand how to \nwork, how to be productive, how to accept responsibilities. One of the \nfirst jobs I had was as a dishwasher in the local restaurant down the \nstreet. It was a job on Friday or a Saturday night. I was not a \nCatholic, but I was very thankful for Catholics because they had an \naffinity for fish on Friday nights. This restaurant served fish and \nthus had a job for a dishwasher.\n\n[[Page S7433]]\n\n  That job has been eliminated now. The higher costs have encouraged \nthem to automate much of the function. Yes, they still have some \ndishes, but now it is different. Two things have happened. One, they \nhave automated, and, two, the higher cost of labor has caused many \nrestaurants to skip recyclable dishes and simply use paper plates. \nThose who go to McDonald's or Burger King or many of the other fast \nfood restaurants know what that means, but they may not understand the \njobs that are lost because we have the fast food operations.\n  I was a lawn boy. It was a great job. I worked 40 hours a week in \nhigh school, long days on Saturday and Sunday. It is the way I paid my \nway through school. Most of those jobs are gone now, at least in the \narea we were in. Not all of them, but in the area we were in, many of \nthem no longer put in the kind of vegetation that needs the intense \ncare that it did. Some of them, thankfully, are still available. But \nthis change in wage will affect the job opportunities that are \navailable to kids.\n  I was a busboy and a waiter. Those jobs with fast food restaurants \nhave largely been dropped. I worked in a service station for 4 years. \nThose jobs primarily have been dropped, not all of them but most of \nthem. You have now self-service in your filling stations. I assume we \nhave a whole generation who does not really know what a full-service \ngas station is. It used to be a great source of jobs for teenagers.\n  Mr. President, the point is this, this measure will have an impact, \nnot necessarily on the families, but will have an impact on jobs \navailable to kids. Mr. President, you ask yourself, what happens to \nkids who get out of school at noon--and there are a lot of school \ndistricts in this country that end at noon or 12:30; in Colorado I know \nthere are some that end at 12:30 and 1 o'clock--and there is no one \nhome because mom is out working, as my mom was, until 6 o'clock at \nnight or 7 o'clock at night?\n  Ask yourself what happens to a teenaged boy--I say teenaged boy \nbecause I think the propensity to get into trouble is greater for them \nthan for girls; but I suspect both are subject to that problem. You ask \nwhat happens to them with little homework from their schools and 4 or 5 \nhours off in the afternoon and no job.\n  Mr. President, I can tell you what happens. All you have to do is \nlook around this country and see what happens. You deny those kids \njobs, and you do not keep them busy, you create a crime problem and a \njuvenile problem of epic proportions. No one should look at what \nhappens in this country today and not understand that the absence of \njob opportunities for teenagers and for high school kids, both male and \nfemale, is a major factor in the rise of juvenile delinquency.\n  So, Mr. President, people will vote on their philosophy. Some will \nsay they are doing something to help out low-income people. But, Mr. \nPresident, we also should keep in mind what we do to young people when \nwe deny them job opportunities. We reduce the chance to learn, the way \nto earn your way out of poverty. I yield the floor, Mr. President.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I have the great pleasure of yielding 8 \nminutes to the distinguished Senator from Illinois, a scholar and a \nfriend.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois, Senator Simon, is \nrecognized for 8 minutes.\n  Mr. SIMON. I thank my colleague from New York, and I thank him for \nhis leadership.\n  I strongly support the minimum wage and I oppose the Bond amendment. \nThe speech that my friends from Colorado and Utah just made about \nteenagers, if the Bond amendment said, let us not apply it to those \nunder 18, then, frankly, I might even consider voting for such an \namendment. I think that would make a little bit of sense. I do not \nthink the Bond amendment, as it is constructed, does make sense.\n  Raising the minimum wage clearly is needed. I hear the phrase \n``welfare reform'' around here a great deal. But 95 percent of it is \nnot welfare reform. This bill raising the minimum wage probably will do \nmore for welfare reform than all the bills that are called ``welfare \nreform'' around here because you give people a chance to earn a little. \nYou give them an option.\n  Twenty-four percent of our children in this Nation live in poverty. \nNo other Western industrialized nation has anything close to that. If \nyou need a good argument for campaign finance reform, look at what is \nhappening in the minimum wage. What if the people at the minimum wage \nwere big contributors? Would we have this kind of a problem? The \nminimum wage would pass overwhelmingly. And this is a women's issue; 58 \npercent of the people who draw the minimum wage are women. We ought to \nbe doing better than this.\n  Having said that, Mr. President, I am concerned about some provisions \nin the basic bill, the small business provisions, and the managers' \namendment which I am going to ask for a vote for and will oppose. On \nthe basic bill, we knock out the incentive to banks to finance ESOP's, \nthe employee stock option plans. This is a legacy of Senator Russell \nLong, and it is a good legacy for our country. ESOP's should be \nencouraged, not discouraged. Let no one fool themselves; knocking out \nthis financial incentive for ESOP's virtually kills the chance for \nadditional ESOP's in this country.\n  Second, the modification of the 401(k) plans. Here it is geared to \nhelping people in the higher income brackets. Here is a letter from the \nAmerican Academy of Actuaries. Let me just quote from this letter.\n\n       There is likely to be increased discrimination in favor of \n     highly compensated employees. Such redistribution of \n     contributions in favor of higher income workers could tarnish \n     401(k) plans to the extent that they would no longer receive \n     the support needed in Congress to justify their cost to \n     taxpayers.\n\n  Under current law, if lower income employees put in 1 percent, or \ndefer 1 percent, higher income employees can defer 2 percent. There is \na whole series of limitations. Under this proposal, if a lower income \nemployee puts in 1 percent, the higher income employee can defer 9.5 \npercent. It is clearly for the benefit of those in the high-income \nbrackets who work for corporations.\n  Then, finally, Mr. President, in the managers' amendment, which is a \nprocedure under which we put this in--and we did not have a chance to \nmodify it, no amendments; and the same on these other provisions that I \njust talked about--this reverses the Hancock versus Harris Trust \ndecision in the U.S. Supreme Court. It is an ERISA thing. I have to \ntell you candidly--I see the chair of our committee here, and she knows \nthis--I do not know that much about ERISA, and, real candidly, I do not \nthink anyone in the U.S. Senate really understands ERISA. It is a very \ncomplicated thing.\n  I do know this, that we are moving back on safeguarding the pension \nfunds of workers with this amendment. What the Harris Trust decision \ndid was, it said that the John Hancock Co., when it set aside pension \nfunds in stocks, had to meet the ERISA standards. But what John Hancock \nwas doing was taking these other funds and putting them--let me read \nthe Supreme Court decision, the group annuity contract No. 50, which is \nwhat they call it there.\n\n       Group annuity contract No. 50 assets were not segregated, \n     however. They were part of Hancock's pool of corporate funds \n     or general account out of which Hancock pays its cost of \n     operation and satisfies its obligations to policyholders and \n     other creditors.\n\n  They do not think they had to meet ERISA standards. The Supreme Court \nsaid you have to meet ERISA standards here, and the managers' \namendment, with all due respect to my friends who are sponsoring this, \nthe managers' amendment reverses that decision and says that insurance \ncompanies, when they do not have these fixed stocks and put the rest in \nthe general pool, they continue to do that, out of which they take all \nthese expenses.\n\n  Let me just point out one unusual feature of this bill. Mr. \nPresident, you have been here a while in this body and in the other \nbody. Listen to this: ``The amendment made by this section shall take \neffect on January 1, 1975.'' Have you heard about a bill like that \nbefore? Why does this take effect January 1, 1975? To protect insurance \ncompanies who have abused these pension funds so they do not have to \nmeet ERISA standards. That is not good legislation, my friends. We \nought to be protecting pension funds, not loosening the protection.\n  I have great respect for Senator Moynihan, Senator Roth, Senator \nLott,\n\n[[Page S7434]]\n\nand Senator Daschle, but I think this is a move in the wrong direction. \nThe managers' amendment ought to be defeated. We should not reverse \nthat Supreme Court decision. Justice Thomas wrote the dissent and took \nthe side of the insurance companies. The U.S. Senate, with this vote, \nwill take the side of the insurance companies. There is huge money \ninvolved. I was told about $300 billion in assets are affected here. I \nreceived a call from our former colleague, Senator Howard Metzenbaum, \nwho said, ``You are wrong. It is $500 billion.'' I do not know what it \nis. Maybe it is $100 billion. Whatever it is, it is a lot of money. We \nought to be doing everything we can to protect pension funds, not to \nmove in the other direction.\n  Mr. President, when the time comes on the managers' amendment, I will \nrequest a vote. I will vote against it. I know what the situation is \nand I recognize that I will be outvoted but I want to make clear I am \nnot part of moving in this direction.\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM. Mr. President, I yield myself 2 minutes from the \nleaders' time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized.\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM. If I may respond briefly to my good friend and \ncolleague and member of the Labor Committee as well, some clarification \non the Harris Trust. I have spoken earlier to it and I will not \nreiterate. I certainly agree, ERISA is complicated. It is something all \nof us struggle to understand.\n  In this particular situation, as I pointed out, the administration is \nstrongly for this. This particular language in the managers' amendment \ndoes not overturn the Harris Trust. What it does is require the Labor \nDepartment to issue guidance by March of next year as to how insurance \ncompanies are to deal with pension plans in the future. Because the \nSupreme Court decision created some concerns about how these would be \nhandled as plan assets, there needs to be a clarification. Until that \nclarification is given, much is in doubt, and many workers will be \nseriously hampered by uncertainty regarding their pension plans and how \nit would be counted as a plan asset.\n  I just suggest to the Senator from Illinois, we made two changes \nwhich we hoped would address some of the concerns that had been raised \nby the Senator from Illinois. One was the legislation would not grant \nrelief from proceedings based on fraudulent or criminal activities by \ninsurers. I know that had been a concern. That language is now clearly \nstated. Second, that the legislation gives the Secretary of Labor \nauthority to ensure that insurers do not engage in prohibited \ntransactions prior to the issuance of final guidelines.\n\n  I had hoped that might take care of some of the concern of the \nSenator from Illinois.\n  Mr. SIMON. If my colleague would yield.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. I yield to the Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, I am happy to respond. Some of what the \nSenator says is correct, and I appreciate the changes that were made. I \ndo think this area is complicated enough we should have at least had a \nhearing. Here we are passing this massive change without a hearing. I \nthink it is not a good way for a legislative body to proceed.\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM. Mr. President, just to respond, we have considered \nthis in the last Congress as well. We have not had a full-blown hearing \nbut it is something Senator Metzenbaum, as part of the Labor Committee \nin the last Congress, raised. It has been under consideration for some \ntime as all parties were trying to find common ground. It was hoped \nthis was the common ground that would succeed.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I yield 8 minutes to the Senator from \nConnecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. I thank my colleague. I commend my colleague from New York \nand others who have been responsible for putting this matter together. \nBefore getting to my comments on the minimum wage, let me also address \nthe issue raised by our colleague from Illinois that our colleague from \nKansas responded to, and that is dealing with the Harris Trust matter.\n  Mr. President, let me say categorically and unequivocally to you, Mr. \nPresident, as well as to our colleagues, there is nothing in the \nmanagers' amendment that reverses the Harris decision by the Supreme \nCourt--nothing at all. To put it briefly here, for 20 years the \nindustry had operated on a set of guidelines established by the \nDepartment of Labor. No action was brought by the Department of Labor. \nIt relied on the guidance as a means of how they did business dealing \nwith pensions. In fact, no one can demonstrate any wrong that was done \nat all.\n  The Supreme Court reached its decision in 1993 and and said using the \nguidance of the Department of Labor is invalid. The Court also in the \ndecision then recommended that the Department of Labor or Congress \nestablish new guidelines and regulations by which these pensions would \nbe regulated. The Department of Labor thought it would be better if \nCongress acted and they acted on their own, and it ought to be done \nstatutorily rather than by regulation. So for the past year and a half \nthe Department of Labor, the industry, and those of us who have been \ninvolved in this matter, have spent about a year and a half putting \ntogether this amendment that is prospective, deals forward, and sets up \na series of regulations that will not go into effect until next June, \nafter serious consideration.\n  We do not establish the regulations, the Department of Labor does. \nWhat those who are opposed to us doing this have in mind is that they \nwant to have the retroactivity and to go back into those 20 years that \nthe industry was allowed, through no action at all, to operate under \nDepartment of Labor guidances. Obviously, it could be a windfall to the \ntrial lawyers to go back and bring actions based on 20 years of \npractice. We are trying to respond to that decision at the direction of \nthe Court and to do so in a comprehensive, thoughtful way. That is what \nwe have done.\n  I point out that the language of this amendment dealing with the \nHarris Trust passed the committee 14 to 2 in a bipartisan vote. A lot \nof effort went into this. I commend my colleague from Kansas, Senator \nKassebaum, who did a remarkably fine job, along with her staff. Bob \nReich, the Secretary of Labor sent a letter to the chairman of the \ncommittee, Senator Kassebaum and Senator Kennedy urging adoption of \nthis legislation. They spent a long time at it. As our colleague from \nIllinois pointed out, ERISA is complicated, but to suggest somehow we \nare reversing the Harris decision is just totally, completely, \nfundamentally incorrect.\n  What we are trying to do is deal with a situation that, if we do not \naddress, puts pensioners at risk by leaving the situation with only the \nHarris decision and no corrections being made.\n  So I say, with all due respect to those who oppose this, this is a \nwindfall, or could potentially be something that the trial lawyers \nwould love to dive into for 20 years based on the Harris decision. We \nare saying, for 20 years that is how it operated. No one complained \nabout it. No wrong was done. We are correcting a situation.\n  I commend those who have been involved in this for bringing us to the \npoint where we are going to finally straighten this matter out, as it \nshould be.\n  For those reasons I hope, at least on that basis, that our colleagues \nwill vote against the managers' amendment that deals with a number of \nissues.\n  Let me now reach, if I can, to the substance of what is the major \ndebate and argument, and that is dealing with the minimum wage \nincrease.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the sum and substance of \nmy prepared remarks be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the statement was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                              Minimum Wage\n\n       Mr. President, nearly 6 months ago, President Clinton came \n     before a joint session of Congress with a commonsense \n     proposal--increasing America's minimum wage from $4.25 to \n     $5.15 an hour.\n       Considering that we've joined together in the past--in a \n     bipartisan manner--to raise the minimum wage and lend a hand \n     to working Americans, this would seem to be a straightforward \n     initiative.\n       However, since January 1996, the snow melted, the \n     temperatures swelled, and the flowers began to bloom, but for \n     America's working families the minimum wage remains very \n     close to a 40-year low.\n\n[[Page S7435]]\n\n       Because, over the past 5\\1/2\\ months, the Republican \n     leadership in Congress has utilized every possible tool to \n     block this legislation.\n       They've tried to convince the American people that raising \n     the minimum wage will cost jobs--even though study after \n     study shows this to be untrue.\n       They raised erroneous economic arguments--even though 101 \n     economists, including 3 Nobel Prize winners, endorse an \n     increase in the minimum wage.\n       They've asserted that minimum wage recipients are wealthy \n     high school kids flipping hamburgers--even though more than \n     73 percent of minimum-wage workers are adults.\n       Even though more than 47 percent are full-time workers and \n     4 in 10 are the sole wage earner for their families.\n       Now today, after nearly 6 months the Republican leadership \n     in Congress is finally giving the Senate an opportunity to \n     cast a vote on the minimum wage.\n       But, it seems just as we climb one mountain, my colleagues \n     across the aisle put another one in the way.\n       Because what we have before us today is not an amendment to \n     increase the minimum wage.\n       Instead we have an amendment that would eviscerate the \n     minimum wage.\n       Under the provisions of the Bond amendment one would be \n     hard pressed to find any American who actually would benefit \n     from this phony increase.\n       First of all, it would exempt an entire category of \n     Americans from the minimum wage's benefits--namely the 10.5 \n     million who work for companies that make less than $500,000. \n     That represents two-thirds of all workplaces.\n       Second, the Bond amendment would delay any increase until \n     January 1, 1997.\n       So after making working families wait nearly 6 months for \n     Congress even to vote on a minimum wage, Republicans would \n     make Americans--struggling to get by--wait an additional 6 \n     months to see any benefit. But, that's only the beginning.\n       Exemptions in the Bond amendment would force working \n     Americans to wait 180 days after starting a new job before \n     receiving a minimum wage increase.\n       This provision along with the delay in implementation until \n     January 1, 1997, would mean America's working families would, \n     at the earliest, not receive the benefits of an increased \n     minimum wage until July 1997.\n       Now, I know my colleagues across the aisle say this \n     provision is necessary to protect small businesses.\n       Well, I say, what about working families? Who will protect \n     them?\n       Certainly not this legislation. Because under the Bond \n     amendment working Americans would be at the mercy of their \n     employers.\n       There is absolutely nothing in this amendment to stop a \n     business from paying a new employee at the subminimum wage \n     for 179 days, firing them, and then turning around and hiring \n     a new worker, whom they could then pay at the same subminimum \n     wage.\n       Under the Bond amendment, there is little incentive for a \n     business to keep a new employee for more than 180 days and \n     provide a minimum wage increase.\n       Instead, for millions of American workers struggling to \n     work their way out of poverty and make ends meet, their \n     newfound paychecks would be replaced by pink slips or another \n     subminimum wage-paying job.\n       Well, Mr. President, in my State of Connecticut and \n     throughout America, working families cannot afford to wait \n     any longer for a real increase in the minimum wage.\n       And if we're going to be truly serious about helping those \n     Americans that work hard and play by the rules, then an \n     immediate and unequivocal increase in the minimum wage should \n     pass by a unanimous vote.\n       Now, I realize that the Democratic proposal of an extra 90 \n     cents an hour may not seem like a lot.\n       But, raising the minimum wage would benefit nearly 12 \n     million Americans.\n       For those Americans who are struggling to get by at $4.25 \n     an hour this increase represents $1,800 in potential income.\n       Raising the minimum wage could pay for 7 months of \n     groceries, 1 year of health care costs, or more than a year's \n     tuition at a 2-year college.\n       Today, the annual income of a minimum wage worker is $8,500 \n     a year--well below the poverty level for a family of three, \n     which is $12,500.\n       In fact today, nearly one in five minimum wage workers \n     lives in poverty.\n       How can any American expect to bring themselves out of \n     poverty or pull themselves up by their bootstraps when \n     they're expected to raise a family on $8,500 a year?\n       The fact is, at the present rate minimum-wage workers have \n     little hope of ever earning their way out of poverty.\n       But if the rate is increased the dream of reaching the \n     middle class becomes attainable.\n       Over the past year I've heard a lot of talk from the other \n     side of the aisle about encouraging responsibility and a \n     strong work ethic among our Nation's welfare recipients. I \n     think it's something we can all agree upon.\n       But, it's utter hypocrisy to talk about encouraging \n     responsibility while we ask our Nation's poorest citizens to \n     live on a meager wage of $36 a day.\n       I know my colleagues on the other side of the aisle like to \n     claim that raising the minimum wage would cause unemployment.\n       But, according to The New York Times a 90-cent minimum wage \n     increase would probably eliminate fewer than 100,000 of the \n     approximately 14 million low-paid jobs in the economy. That's \n     less than a 1 percent loss.\n       In addition, studies done after the minimum wage was raised \n     in 1990 demonstrate that not only did it have a negligible \n     effect on job loss, but in some locales it actually brought \n     higher employment.\n       The fact is, a higher minimum wage is not only a stronger \n     incentive to work, but it reduces turnover, increases \n     productivity and lowers cost for retraining and recruiting.\n       The minimum wage is not, and should not be, a political \n     issue.\n       In fact, I am pleased to see that members from both sides \n     of the aisle are coming to the realization that low-wage \n     workers in this country deserve a pay raise.\n       The Republican amendment before us today would leave \n     millions of Americans mired in poverty, barely able to make \n     ends meet and struggling to put food on the table.\n       Today, we have an historic opportunity to reverse that \n     trend and lend a helping hand to millions of America's \n     working families.\n       I strongly urge all my colleagues to reject the Bond \n     amendment and continue the bipartisan tradition of supporting \n     the minimum wage as a living wage for working Americans.\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I am saddened by this day that we are \ninvolved in a lengthy debate about the increase in the minimum wage. \nThis should not be happening. It really should not be happening. We are \ntalking about a 90-cent increase over 2 years. It has been 5 or 6 years \nsince we have had any increase at all.\n  The notion somehow that a family--remember, more than 73 percent of \nthe people who get the minimum wage are over the age of 20. If you are \non the minimum wage and you are age 20, it is not inconceivable that \nyou are raising a family. We are not talking about teenagers. Few are \nover the age of 25. Some are. Obviously, then the number comes down. \nYou have a sizable number of people between the ages of 20 and 25. But \nto suggest somehow that you can live on $36 a day--that is what the \nminimum wage is--$36 a day, with more than 73 percent of the people \nearning the minimum wage over the age of 20, and that we can't find it \nhere possible to come up with a 90-cent increase for those people.\n  If you will just consider the great debate we had here over last \nyear's welfare reform, one of the major matters of debate and concern \nis, how do you avoid people falling back into dependency and on to \npublic assistance? How do we get people who are living on welfare to \nmove from welfare to work? That has been the subject of major debate \nand discussion here.\n  How ironic, indeed, in this day in July that we are now going to \npotentially reverse or deny the opportunity for people who are making a \nminimum wage today, to get a modest increase over the next 2 years. \nWith the minimum wage close to a 40-year low in terms of earning power, \nhow do we prevent people from tumbling back into welfare?\n  It seems to me that this ought to be passing unanimously on a voice \nvote. This ought not be the subject of an acrimonious debate on minimum \nwage at the very hour we are trying to move people from welfare to \nwork. How can we say to people that if you get a minimum wage job, the \nmost you can hope to make is $8,500 a year or $36 a day? I do not know \nof anywhere in America that you can live on $36 a day any longer. In \nfact, that is almost $4,000 less a year than is the poverty level for a \nfamily of four--which is $12,500.\n  Frankly, as our colleagues know, there is no illusion. The Bond \namendment is designed to just blow significant holes through the \nminimum wage and would take away from the roughly 10 million people who \nwould otherwise qualify for the minimum wage and deny them the \nopportunity--those 10 million Americans--from seeing any benefit from a \nminimum wage increase.\n  Our colleague from Minnesota earlier pointed out the benefits of \n$1,800. That is what a minimum wage increase of 90 cents amounts to--\n$1,800 a year. With $1,800, you could afford a year of health insurance \nfor yourself, or at least participate in health insurance. It is more \nthan a year's tuition for the average 2-year community college, $1,800 \na year. Think what a benefit that might be for someone at that minimum \nwage level trying to better themselves, trying to improve themselves, \nto be able to get an education, to move themselves further along, to \navoid tumbling back, as I said earlier, into a life of dependency on \nState, local, or Federal welfare;\n\n[[Page S7436]]\n\n$1,800 a year could buy groceries for a family for 7 months.\n  So while I know people say we have to protect small business, I \nunderstand that. But of one study that I have seen done, says of the \napproximately 14 million low-paid jobs in the economy that could \npotentially be affected--there may be fewer than 100,000 jobs that \nwould be adversely affected by a minimum wage increase. One of the most \nconservative studies done says 100,000 people out of 14 million people.\n  I appreciate and understand the concern of wanting to protect small \nbusinesses. But how about protecting these people out there that we \ntalk about all the time, who are getting off welfare, staying off \nwelfare, and going to work? They need protection as well.\n  Lastly, I would point out, as someone earlier did--I believe my \ncolleague from Massachusetts--we have now done away pretty much with \nthe summer JOBS Program. Again, what an irony indeed that we would be \nsitting here today talking about youth employment at the very time we \nought to be trying to put kids to work during the summer. Then we turn \naround and deny, of course, a minimum wage increase that could \npotentially affect and benefit those younger people, as well, who would \nbe looking for some employment, to be able to participate and \ncontribute to their own educational needs and costs of participating \nand contributing to their family's financial needs.\n  I will conclude as I began on this point. Again, I am saddened by \nthis debate. This should not be happening--this debate.\n  This is something that we passed and which has enjoyed strong \nbipartisan support. When President Bush took the leadership on it, it \nhad bipartisan support. We have spent so many weeks. We have gone from \nthe winter now into the depths of summer arguing for an increase in the \nminimum wage. I think it is a sad day, indeed, for this body.\n  So I urge my colleagues for the remaining hour or so which we have \nbefore the vote to search their souls on this issue and support this \nminimum wage increase, and oppose the Bond amendment, which would gut \nthis effort.\n  I thank my colleague.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. I thank my friend from Connecticut for clarifying most \nparticularly the provision in the managers' amendment concerning the \npension fund. I hope they listened to it carefully, and also the \nremarks of the chairman of the Committee on Labor and Human Resources, \nthe senior Senator from Kansas.\n  Mr. President, I yield 8 minutes to my distinguished friend and \nneighbor from Vermont.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont is recognized.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Thank you. I thank my good friend from New York State. We \nhave the privilege of living parts of the year in the northern parts of \nour two States. I commend him for the strong work that he has done on \nthis. He has been a stalwart supporter, as well as the Senator from \nConnecticut and the Senator from Massachusetts, of the question of the \nminimum wage.\n  Mr. President, it really comes down to this: Working Americans \ndeserve the opportunity to earn a decent wage.\n  It has been more than 5 years since the last increase in the minimum \nwage. You would think when it has been more than 5 years, that would be \nenough reason to increase the minimum wage, just that issue alone. But \nduring the last 5 years, living costs have not stood still. In fact, \nthe cost of living has gone up.\n  Since 1991, the average monthly gas bill has gone up. Since 1991, the \naverage monthly electric bill has gone up. In fact, in my home State of \nVermont, where many Vermonters use wood stoves to heat their homes, and \nwhen it is 20 below zero--that is not a luxury in heating your homes--\nbut since 1991, the average cost of a cord of wood has gone up. But \nthroughout all this time, the minimum wage has stayed the same.\n  The basic living costs of working Americans in every area--food, \nheat, shelter, transportation--have gone up. But the minimum wage has \nremained the same.\n  In fact, the minimum wage is at a 40-year low, as far as its buying \npower. The minimum wage earner today grosses only $8,840 a year.\n  I defy anybody in this body to try to raise a family on that amount \nof money. But there are people who do.\n  In Newport, VT, the most rural area of my home State, Brian Deyo and \nhis family have been trying to do just that. In fact, the Wall Street \nJournal reporter met Mr. Deyo and his family and wrote the article \nabout the sheer harshness of life on the minimum wage.\n  Mr. Deyo works full time in a hockey stick factory. He brings home \n$188.40 a week. A lot of the time he and his wife have had to choose \nbetween paying rent, or buying food, or paying the medical expenses for \na chronically ill daughter.\n  They talk about sometimes during especially tough times, Mr. Deyo \nwill take his last $5 and go down to the hardware store and buy a box \nof bullets to go hunting in the Vermont woods because that is the only \nway his family is going to eat. And he will go out there and hope that \nhe gets lucky and finds a deer.\n\n  But I think Mr. Deyo said it better than any of us ever could. He \nsaid, and I quote him, ``I'm proud to be a working man. I only wish I \ncould make a living.''\n  So I ask unanimous consent that a copy of the Wall Street Journal \narticle about Brian Deyo and his family, entitled ``Minimum Wage Jobs \nGive Many Americans Only a Miserable Life,'' be printed in the Record \nafter my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Ashcroft). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. LEAHY. But as the Wall Street Journal points out, Brian Deyo is \nnot alone. Many working families depend on the minimum wage. In fact, \n73 percent of those affected by the proposed minimum wage increase are \nadults. Many are trying to support their families on a minimum wage, \nand that minimum wage has been mauled by inflation. This should be a \nbipartisan issue.\n  The distinguished Senator from Connecticut just said, as others have, \nthe last time it was raised it was--I believe my good friend from New \nYork will agree with this--under a Republican President, and the time \nbefore that, the Senator from New York reminds me. We had Republicans \nand Democrats joined together on this. The last minimum wage increase, \nwhich was a 2-year 90-cent increase just like the one that is under \nconsideration today, received overwhelming bipartisan support when it \nwas voted on in 1989. In fact, it passed the House by a vote of 382 to \n37--better than 10 to 1. It passed the Senate by a vote of 89 to 8--\nagain, better than 10 to 1.\n  Back then, Senator Dole and Speaker Gingrich voted for raising the \nminimum wage, but today some of my colleagues on the other side of the \naisle fiercely oppose any raise in the minimum wage. I find it ironic \nthat some of the same Senators who would vote to give tax breaks to the \nwealthy are against giving working families a raise. Some have said \nthey will fight with ``every fiber of their being'' the idea that a \nperson who works 40 hours a week could make as much in a year as \nMembers of Congress make in a month.\n  So let us not play politics with the lives of working families \nstruggling to live on the minimum wage. We need to pass a minimum wage \nincrease now. I hope my colleagues will support Senator Kennedy's \namendment and support this bill to make the minimum wage a living wage.\n  Let us be serious about what we are talking about. Let us think, \nwould any of us accept for ourselves or our families the basic minimum \nwage today? Would any of us accept the idea that our family, members of \nour family, would try to support a family, whether it is our children, \nour siblings, cousins, or anybody else, at the minimum wage?\n  They cannot live on it in Vermont. They cannot live on that in \nCalifornia or Texas or, frankly, Mr. President, in any State in this \ncountry. So let us let the Senate at least stand up and do the right \nthing.\n  Mr. President, I yield back to the Senator from New York.\n\n[[Page S7437]]\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n             [From the Wall Street Journal, Nov. 12, 1993]\n\n    The Working Poor: Minimum-Wage Jobs Give Many Americans Only a \n                             Miserable Life\n\n\n in rural vermont, some go week to week, hoping no major bills hit them\n\n                       hunting bear for the table\n\n                           (By Tony Horwitz)\n\n       Newport, VT.--On payday, Brian Deyo's sole purchase is a \n     $4.96 box of cheap bullets known as ``full metal jackets.''\n       Mr. Deyo works full time at a hockey-stick factory. He \n     takes home $188.40 a week. After rent and utilities, that \n     leaves about $20 for food--and no margin at all for \n     misfortune, such as the one Mr. Deyo now faces. Vermont's \n     brutal cold hit freakishly early this fall, and he must buy \n     heating oil three paychecks ahead of plan.\n       ``Every day I'm making choices,'' says Mr. Deyo, who has a \n     wife and a chronically ill two-year-old daughter. ``Do I pay \n     the rent and risk having the power cut? Or do we take a \n     chance on both and buy food?''\n       This payday, the choice is clear: He's two weeks late on \n     the rent, and the fuel tank must be filled. Unable to afford \n     food, he will hunt for it. Stalking through the icy woods \n     beneath the Green Mountains, Mr. Deyo mulls his life. At age \n     28, he senses he has done something wrong, but he isn't sure \n     what. ``I'm proud to be a workingman,'' the son of two \n     factory workers says. ``I only wish I made a living.''\n       ``Making work pay'' has become a Clinton administration \n     catch phrase, but one that appears increasingly hard to \n     fulfill. Put simply, the aim is to lift working Americans \n     above the poverty line--a threshold that Mr. Deyo and 9.4 \n     million others currently don't reach. Almost 60% of poor \n     families have at least one member working. ``Someone who \n     plays by the rules and tries to work full time should be able \n     to support a family,'' says Lawrence Katz, chief economist at \n     the Labor Department.\n       However, with universal health insurance--one means toward \n     achieving this goal--under siege, the administration has \n     retreated from another. In late October, after arguing for \n     months that a modest rise in the minimum wage is needed to \n     help pull workers out of poverty, Labor Secretary Robert \n     Reich shelved his campaign until after Congress votes on \n     health-care reform. This delay was welcomed by business \n     groups, which argue that an increase would cost jobs because \n     employers would automate, relocate overseas or cut staff to \n     recoup higher labor costs.\n       But what's often obscured by such policy debate is the \n     sheer harshness of life in low-wage America. The minimum \n     wage--currently $4.25 an hour--was mauled by inflation in the \n     1980s and now provides an income so meager that welfare \n     recipients often do better if they turn down jobs paying it. \n     A full-time minimum-wage worker grosses $8,840 a year--$2,300 \n     under the poverty line for a family of three. In 1979, the \n     same worker earned $459 above the line.\n       The depressed minimum wage also anchors the bottom end of a \n     pay ladder so low that even people who, like Mr. Deyo, climb \n     up a few rungs are still in poverty. In fact, such workers \n     often are worse off than those earning $4.25 an hour because \n     they are more likely to be adults and heads of households \n     qualifying for little or no government assistance. Many \n     minimum-wage workers are young part-timers with other income \n     from spouses or parents.\n       ``Families where the main breadwinner is making $5 or $6 an \n     hour--these are the people who are really hurting,'' says \n     Gary Burtless, a labor economist at the Brookings \n     Institution. This largely forgotten group also helps account \n     for the 44.3% jump in the number of working poor between 1979 \n     and 1992.\n       America's working poor are mostly white, mostly high-school \n     educated and disproportionately rural--a profile that is \n     typified by the three-county corner of Vermont known as the \n     Northeast Kingdom. This bucolic landscape of moose crossings, \n     maple-syrup stands and scarlet foliage also harbors 10% \n     unemployment, closed mills and ramshackle homes.\n       Barbara Stevens runs a crisis center in Newport, a town of \n     4,700 that is a two-hour drive from Burlington. The morning \n     after the first big chill, her office was crammed with \n     disheveled people unprepared for the winter and seeking help. \n     Many were on their way to work. ``They'd say things like, \n     `I've got two kids and no oil in the furnace, so we slept in \n     the car last night with the heat on,' '' Ms. Stevens says.\n       One such visitor is Mr. Deyo, the hockey-stick worker. Late \n     paying his bills, he has had his electricity disconnected \n     several times. This is a special calamity for Mr. Deyo; his \n     daughter has asthma and relies on a ventilator. Letters from \n     Ms. Stevens and local doctors have helped him to get his \n     power switched back on.\n       Ironically, Mr. Deyo is earning more than he ever has. \n     After years of minimum-wage jobs, he gets $5.50 an hour \n     stenciling trademarks onto hockey-stick blades. His annual \n     gross income is so near the poverty line that now he \n     qualifies for very little public assistance. In principle, \n     this suits him fine; he's a former National Guardsman and \n     a conservative Republican wary of government and liberal \n     ``do-gooders.'' But in practice, just a minor setback--\n     even a blown-out tire on his 1980 Buick--sets off a cycle \n     of late bills, ruined credit ratings and shakey \n     employment.\n       Though the cost of living here is low, his take-home pay of \n     $188.40 a week barely covers his fixed costs: $60 rent for a \n     cramped apartment, about $40 for heat, $40 for power (high \n     because of his daughter's ventilator and humidifier), $10 for \n     gasoline and $15 for installment payments on the family's few \n     possessions. The Deyos can't afford a phone. That leaves \n     about $20, mostly spent at a discount market that sells \n     dented cans and crushed boxes.\n       ``We don't buy taped boxes because the food could have \n     spilled on the floor and been scooped back in,'' says Roxanna \n     Deyo, who stays home because she is loath to put her frail \n     child in day care.\n       The Deyos also live in terror of small shocks that can \n     knock them off their tightrope budget. Three years ago, for \n     instance, their car developed transmission trouble. Unable to \n     afford a $500 repair bill, Mr. Deyo had to abandon the car--\n     and his job cleaning kitchens at a ski resort more than an \n     hour's drive away.\n       Soon afterward, the Deyos, seeking work in higher-wage \n     Massachusetts, sold all they owned to go there. But they ran \n     out of money before finding jobs. Two years later, they are \n     still making payments on the used, now-tattered furniture \n     they bought on their return north. Many needs are put off \n     indefinitely. Plagued by painful, rotted teeth, Mr. Deyo \n     waited two years until he was laid off and eligible for \n     Medicaid before having a few pulled.\n       Week to week, the Deyos still cling to one luxury. To \n     ``break the constant tension,'' Mr. Deyo says, he buys a \n     take-away dinner every Saturday, usually a plain pizza \n     costing $5.99.\n       ``I feel like I'm doing what I'm supposed to do,'' says Mr. \n     Deyo, who dreamed of studying forestry when he graduated from \n     high school but couldn't afford the fees and went to work at \n     McDonald's instead. ``I work hard, my family's together. But \n     I'm running just to stay where I am, which isn't a real great \n     place.''\n       His most recent frustration: an attempt to free his family \n     of rent--and of their grim quarters--by purchasing a $24,000 \n     trailer to park on his parents' land. A local bank refused \n     his loan request, citing ``excess obligations'' and \n     ``insufficient income.''\n       One upbeat note: the Deyos, who anxiously await their \n     annual rebate from the earned-income tax credit to catch up \n     on bills and buy appliances, should see the amount double in \n     early 1995 to about $3,200 because of a recent change in the \n     law.\n       A growing number of Americans share the Deyos' plight. \n     Lawrence Mishel of the Washington-based Economic Policy \n     Institute says 28% of adult workers are at wage levels too \n     low to keep a family of four out of poverty, compared with \n     21% in 1979. He also notes that their privation has deepened: \n     14.3% of adult workers now earn wages below 75% of the \n     poverty line, triple the 1979 percentage.\n       Mr. Mishel and other economists cite various reasons, such \n     as the decline of manufacturing jobs and of unions in an \n     ever-more technological economy. In addition, minimum-wage \n     increases, which tend to bump up the whole bottom of the pay \n     scale, didn't occur between 1981 and 1990. That especially \n     hurt young workers, such as Mr. Deyo, who began working \n     during the 1980s at the minimum wage and have edged up very \n     slowly ever since.\n       However, the depressed minimum wage may have kept alive \n     some jobs that otherwise would have vanished. Along Newport's \n     railroad tracks, in an old flour depot, American Maple \n     Products Corp. employs 40 people bottling syrup and making \n     candy Santas and other treats. The family-owned company is \n     typical of the light, often-marginal businesses that employ \n     many low-wage workers nationwide.\n       ``Maple candy,'' the company's president, Roger Ames, dryly \n     observes, ``is not your basic growth industry.''\n       Starting most workers at the minimum wage, Mr. Ames ekes \n     out profits of 3% on sales from what he admits is a creaking \n     plant. At one conveyor belt, nine people fill jugs with \n     syrup, then cap, date and box the jugs by hand--a task, Mr. \n     Ames says, that costly new machines can perform with two \n     workers. Nearby, two people run a 50-year-old device that \n     drops candy into molds, while other workers use their fingers \n     to smooth the fuzzy edges left by the plant's old tools.\n       ``If you're paying the minimum wage and it takes 20% more \n     time to do a job than it should, it doesn't seem that \n     critical,'' Mr. Ames says.\n       He adds that a 50-cent increase in the minimum wage would \n     cost him about $100,000 a year and force him to ``take a hard \n     look'' at labor-saving machinery. He would stop replacing \n     workers who leave or retire and go to a peacework system that \n     might penalize older employees.\n       ``I don't have a sweatshop mentality,'' Mr. Ames says. But \n     he says neither he nor other employers are likely to raise \n     their pay simply out of charity, particularly in a \n     competitive industry. ``If you had someone who mowed your \n     lawn every week for $5, would you reach in and pay $10 the \n     next week?'' he asks.\n       Moreover, he is under no pressure to raise pay because few \n     employers deviate from the prevailing wage. The result: an \n     uncompetitive labor market that traps low-skilled workers \n     even as they climb the pay scale. Connie Lucas went to work \n     at American Maple 12 years ago at the minimum wage and now \n     earns $6.10 an hour. With a weekly take-home pay of only \n     $151.50, and worried\n\n[[Page S7438]]\n\n     about the plant's future (her husband also works there), she \n     decided to seek another job.\n       ``But every opening offers the same--$4.25, $4.25, $4.25,'' \n     the 35-year-old Ms. Lucas says. ``I can't afford to work \n     another 12 years just to get back to where I am.''\n       Bonnie Buskey wonders whether she can afford to work at \n     all. Last spring, both she and her husband were unemployed \n     and received about $1,000 a month in public assistance. Now, \n     he works in construction, and she works full time at American \n     Maple at the minimum wage. Together, they bring home about \n     $1,200 a month.\n       But Ms. Buskey pays a baby sitter $2 an hour to look after \n     her two girls for part of the day, slicing her real wage \n     during those hours to $2.25. And now that the Buskeys are off \n     welfare, they no longer qualify for Medicaid. Unable to \n     afford health insurance, Ms. Buskey spent a week's pay on a \n     recent visit to the dentist and lives in dread of serious \n     illness.\n       ``The message from the government seems to be, `Stay home, \n     vegetate in front of the TV, and you'll be better off,' '' \n     the 29-year-old says. Asked why she doesn't, she shrugs. \n     ``Good old American pride. I like to think that I earn \n     whatever I get.''\n       In fact, some people do quit jobs because they can do \n     better on benefits. Ms. Stevens, the Newport social worker, \n     says she feels forced to advise jobless people to turn down \n     work at or near the minimum wage. ``I have to tell them, `The \n     job's good for your soul and good for your mind but not for \n     your pocketbook,' '' she says.\n       Trapped at the bottom by the low minimum wage, such workers \n     also must compete with people sliding down the pay ladder. At \n     the hockey-stick factory, Mr. Deyo's brother-in-law and co-\n     worker, Garth Shannon, has never worked for the minimum wage. \n     His first job after finishing high school was at a shoe \n     factory that paid $9 an hour. But after a wage dispute, the \n     plant moved to the Dominican Republic, and Mr. Shannon has \n     bounced down the pay scale ever since, enduring plant \n     closings, layoffs and menial jobs.\n       ``Most people plan for when things get better,'' says the \n     35-year-old Mr. Shannon, who wears thick glasses on which he \n     pays monthly installments. ``I try to plan for when things \n     get worse.''\n       As a foreman, he is among the factory's best-paid workers, \n     earning $5.95 an hour. But with a family of five, his poverty \n     is even worse than Mr. Deyo's. He heats his jerry-built home \n     with a wood stove in which he burns old doors and other scrap \n     timber salvaged from abandoned houses. He burns kerosene \n     lamps to save on electricity. Like the Deyos, the Shannons \n     can't afford a telephone. They also couldn't afford a \n     foundation when they built the house seven years ago; stones \n     and wood props keep it from sliding downhill.\n       A conservative man with a fierce work ethic, Mr. Shannon \n     has urged his wife to work part time rather than stay home \n     with their youngest daughters, age five and eight. As a \n     nursing-home housekeeper, who earns $4.61 an hour and brings \n     home $20 a week after baby-sitting bills. ``Work is what made \n     this country great,'' says Mr. Shannon, who has draped an \n     American flag across the front of his house.\n       But as he cooks home-made pizza for his girls, he confesses \n     to occasional despair at how little his labor provides for \n     his family. the worst moment came when his five-year-old's \n     kindergarten class took a day trip to a zoo in nearby Canada. \n     The Shannons couldn't afford the $12 bus fare and were too \n     proud to borrow. ``We kept her home that day so she wouldn't \n     feel bad about missing the trip,'' he says.\n       David Price, Mr. Shannon's and Mr. Deyo's boss, is \n     sympathetic. He helped pay for Mr. Shannon's glasses and \n     recently gave him his own children's outgrown clothing. But \n     like Mr. Ames at American Maple, Mr. Price doesn't need to \n     raise pay to keep his 13 workers; he has 500 job applications \n     on file.\n       So Mr. Price does small things, such as treating workers to \n     a birthday lunch. In October, it was Mr. Deyo's turn. \n     Devouring a prime-rib sandwich, he confides that it is his \n     first meal out in six months. Mr. Price also gives workers a \n     turkey at Christmas and a ham at Easter; Mr. Deyo still has a \n     bit of ham left, in his freezer, ``for emergencies,'' he \n     says.\n       But there is little else in the larder. So, on payday, \n     after banking his check to cover the rent, Mr. Deyo buys \n     bullets and drives to his brother-in-law's home. The two men \n     hike off in search of an animal Mr. Shannon recently spotted \n     in a cornfield. ``I've never eaten bear,'' Mr. Deyo says \n     excitely, toting a used military rifle he bought for $80. \n     ``But they look like they have a lot of meat on them.''\n       The two men soon find tracks but no bear. At dusk, after \n     two hours of tramping through dense woods, Mr Deyo spots a \n     crow--``edible if you cook it just right,'' he says. But he \n     can't get close enough for a shot. Frustrated, he aims at a \n     chipmunk. Mr. Shannon talks him out of it. ``There wouldn't \n     be enough meat there for a sandwich,'' he says.\n       Exhausted and cold, the two head back. Mr. Deyo tosses his \n     gun in the trunk. Mr. Shannon touches his brother-in-law on \n     the arm. ``It could have been worse,'' he says. ``At least we \n     didn't waste any bullets.''\n\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, may I just thank the Senator from \nVermont. The remark by Mr. Deyo, ``I'm proud to be a working man. I \nonly wish I could make a living,'' needs to be underscored.\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, in the first place, raising the minimum \nwage is a political issue, not an economic issue. In order to adjust \nthe perspective, it should be remembered that the Senator from \nMassachusetts may be revealing a bit of a forked tongue on this phony \npolitical issue.\n  That is why I am supporting the Lott-Bond amendment which honestly \nand clearly addresses the real issues of this debate.\n  For years, Senator Kennedy served as chairman of the Senate Labor and \nHuman Resources Committee--prior to his losing his chairmanship in the \n1994 elections. To my knowledge the issue of minimum wage increase was \nnever brought up, even once, by Senator Kennedy during the 2 previous \nyears before he lost his chairmanship.\n  But, Mr, President, I recall that in 1995, when the State Department \nreorganization bill became the pending business in the Senate, there he \nwas, the same Senator from Massachusetts, who was the first to pop his \nhead up and begin as the lead-off filibusterer among the Democrats who \nhad their orders to stymie a bill that would have saved the American \ntaxpayers billions of dollars while clearing a lot of dead wood from \nthe U.S. foreign policy apparatus.\n  And what was the subject of Senator Kennedy's filibuster? He was \nshouting at the top of his voice about the dire need to raise the \nminimum wage--a subject, bear in mind that had prompted not a peep out \nof Chairman Kennedy during those years when he headed the Senate Labor \nand Human Resources Committee.\n  But now, the political issue of raising the minimum wage is before \nthe Senate and, at the outset, it would be unfair to the American \npeople to fail to warn them that if the minimum wage is raised, the \nAmerican economy is likely to suffer in a number of ways. Americans--\nparticularly teenagers, minorities, and low-skilled workers--can expect \na significant loss in job opportunities. Moreover a mandatory wage \nincrease will result in countless small businesses throwing in the \ntowel. It has always happened, and it always will.\n  Increasing the minimum wage will therefore harm the working poor and \nhigh school and college students. It will not help them. According to a \nrespected University of Chicago economist, Kevin Murphy, every 10-\npercent hike in the minimum wage reduces job availabilities by 1 \npercent, with the greatest loss of jobs occurring among the working \npoor, and among students.\n  This is why I support the Bond amendment which will curtail some of \nthe harsh effects of a minimum wage increase. The Bond amendment will \nexempt small businesses from the increase in the minimum wage, and it \nwill allow for a training wage for newly hired employees for the first \n6 months. As we all know, most new jobs are created by small \nbusinesses.\n  The Wall Street Journal confirms Professor Murphy's warning, saying,\n\n       . . . to the degree that economists ever reach a consensus \n     on anything, they concur that the minimum wage increases \n     unemployment among low-skilled workers. What's clear is that \n     anyone in the White House with an economics degree has \n     been told to hold his or her nose while the political \n     types try to relaunch the Clinton presidency on a minimum-\n     wage hike.\n\n  Mr. President, while proponents of a minimum wage increase tearfully \npretend to be concerned about the welfare of America's least well-to-do \ncitizens, I dare say the proponents are really interested in the next \nelection. As I stated at the outset, this minimum wage issue was locked \nonto the back burner when the Democrats controlled both ends of \nPennsylvania Avenue. In fact, President Clinton never even mentioned \nthe minimum wage, not once, when Mr. Clinton's party controlled \nCongress in 1993 and 1994.\n  Then when the Democrats lost control of Congress, there came the \nminimum wage issue drowning in phony tears. And with it, the crack of \nthe whips of the powerful labor union bosses. When all that happened, \nPresident Clinton made haste to mention the minimum wage issue more \nthan 47 times.\n  Mr. President, let's play just suppose: Just suppose Congress and the \nPresident do increase the minimum wage, what can the American people \nexpect?\n\n[[Page S7439]]\n\n  The warning has come time after time from bipartisan economists--loss \nof jobs, higher labor costs, and consequential higher prices for \nAmerican consumers.\n  Economists at the Heritage Foundation, for example, estimate that a \n90-cent increase in the minimum wage will result in more than 200,000 \nfewer entry level jobs in 1999. Furthermore, according to an article in \nThe Wall Street Journal ``Lawrence Lindsey, a governor at the Federal \nReserve Board, says internal staff studies suggest a 90-cent increase \nwould reduce employment by about 400,000 jobs over the long term.''\n  Retail prices will, in turn, increase through 1998 because employers \nwill pass their increased costs on to the consumers, with the consumers \nbeing hit hardest. Unemployment among teenagers will increase by an \nexpected 20 percent and will put an end to many entry-level jobs. This, \nof course, will deny young unskilled people the priceless opportunity \nto gain work experience.\n  Labor costs for small businesses, and larger ones as well, will \nincrease, forcing many business owners to make substantial adjustments \nin the way they do business in order to stay afloat.\n  How will employers deal with these new demands imposed on them by the \nFederal Government? They will, of course, pass the costs on to the \nconsumers, raising prices for food, goods and services. Many will have \nto eliminate employees, or reduce benefits to employees--or both. Even \nnew Democrat economist Rob Shapiro concedes as much.\n  Proponents of the increase in the minimum wage want to keep secret \nthe fact that 80 percent of minimum wage earners are not below the \npoverty line. To the contrary, a high percentage of minimum wage \nearners are members of middle-income families. The Bureau of Labor \nStatistics confirm that 37 percent of minimum wage earners are \nteenagers. The vast majority of high school and college students are \nworking at summer jobs, not struggling to feed their families because \nthey are secondary wage-earners in their families.\n\n  Moreover, many of these minimum wage earners in fact take home more \nthan $4.25 an hour. The Bureau of Labor Statistics confirms that ``Just \nover half were employed in retail trade, and another one-fourth worked \nin services. It should be recognized that for many working in these \nindustries, tips and commissions may supplement the hourly wages \nreceived.''\n  So let the record be clear--despite the statements of Senator Kennedy \nand other proponents of raising the minimum wage--the babble of voices \nis trying to sell political nonsense. If Congress really wants to help \nAmerica's working families, it would reduce taxes instead of increasing \nthe minimum wage.\n  Twenty-eight million households would benefits from a $500 per child \ntax credit--but Mr. Clinton vetoed that idea.\n  In North Carolina, 758,648 households would have more take-home money \nwith the $500 per child tax credit. But only 42,876 of those households \nwould benefit from the minimum wage increase.\n  Mr. President, I receive thousands of letters each week, and one of \nthem came from Bruce Stakeman of Durham, a small business owner. In \nexplaining the minimum wage to his son, Jeremy, Mr. Stakeman said:\n\n       I told (Jeremy) that I had a very large yard of 4 acres and \n     would pay him $1 for him to cut. He said no way! I don't \n     blame him. $2.? No. $3.? No. This went on until we reached \n     the dollar amount for which he would be willing to cut my \n     grass. I told him this was the minimum wage. He agreed. If a \n     13-year-old can understand this, why is it so hard for well \n     educated people in Washington to?\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Bruce Stakeman's letter \nbe printed in the Record at the conclusion of my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, one doesn't have to be a rocket scientist \nto understand this issue. It's simply a matter of common sense, and \nreviewing Thomas Jefferson's ideas about the free enterprise system.\n  The American people deserve better than to be misled by political \nschemes. After all, in the mid-thirties, when President Franklin D. \nRoosevelt signed the Social Security legislation into law, he warned \nthat this program must never be allowed to become into a political \nfootball.\n  Mr. President, look at who's booting around this political football.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n\n                             Environmental Technologies, Inc.,\n\n                                                   April 18, 1996.\n     Hon. Jesse A. Helms,\n     Raleigh, NC.\n       Dear Mr. Helms: This is my response to the desire of the \n     liberals to raise the minimum wage. My thirteen year old son \n     and I were in the car when the news came on the radio, about \n     President Clinton's desire to raise the minimum wage. Having \n     owned a small business and managed others I understand the \n     problems associated with its raising. I then began to explain \n     this to my son, Jeremy.\n       Suppose you owned a small business. Let's say for this \n     example we use a restaurant and minimum wage is $4.00 per \n     hour. You have five teenagers employed making $4.00 per hour. \n     You as the employer have taken the chance to start a business \n     and give people a chance to earn a fair wage. You are making \n     a living, but not getting rich. I then asked him, the \n     government tells you that you have to pay the new minimum \n     wage of $5.00 per hour. You want to maintain your standard of \n     living, what do you do? He responded, you could raise your \n     prices. What might happen, I asked? You might lose some of \n     your customers. What else could you do? You could let one of \n     the employees go. Now you have an unemployed person drawing \n     unemployment compensation.\n       Then we discussed what the minimum wage should be? I told \n     him I had a large yard of four acres and would pay him $1.00 \n     for him to cut it. He said, no way! I don't blame him. $2.00? \n     No. $3.00? No. This went on until we reached the dollar \n     amount that he would be willing to cut my grass. I told him \n     this was the minimum wage. He agreed. If a thirteen year old \n     can understand this, why is it so hard for well educated \n     people in Washington to?\n       In Durham, just about everywhere I go has a help wanted \n     sign on their window. Never have I seen a sign for minimum \n     wage, most start at $5.00 per hour. As you see I am opposed \n     to raising the minimum wage. It may mean the difference in my \n     son getting a starter job where he can learn how to work \n     outside the home. Thank you for this opportunity to express \n     my opinion.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                Bruce A. Stakeman.\n\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. Mr. President, I rise in support of the Small \nBusiness Job Protection Act of 1996. This legislation will help small \nbusinesses invest, grow, and create new jobs. I am pleased to be able \nto say that this is a bill that enjoys bipartisan support; it is a \ntestament to the progress that can be made when Senators from both \nsides of the aisle work together.\n  This bill increases the level of investment by small businesses that \ncan be expensed, rather than capitalized and depreciated from the \ncurrent $17,500 level to $25,000. It reforms subchapter S corporation \nlaws, most significantly by increasing the maximum number of \nshareholders in an S corporation from the current 35 to 75. And it \ngives business employers a number of other tools designed to promote \njob creation, expansion, and prosperity.\n  To further stimulate job creation, the bill creates a new tax credit, \nthe work opportunity tax credit. This new credit replaces the current \ntargeted jobs tax credit program. The work opportunity tax credit \nencourages employers to hire people from populations suffering from \nhigh unemployment, who are on government assistance, or who have \nlimited education. The work opportunity tax credit would also create \nincentives to hire 18 to 24 year olds who are on food stamps for 90 \ndays, which will promote self-sufficiency and help prevent these \nindividuals from returning to the welfare system. By creating this new \ncategory for 18 to 24 year olds, employers will have an inducement to \nhire young people who are all too often overlooked. Additionally, the \nminimum employee work requirement would be reduced from 500 to 375 \nhours. This will enable employers to benefit from the credit to \ncompensate for job training costs associated with hiring individuals \nthat generally need extra training and attention.\n  This bill not only helps small businesses, it also expands \nopportunity for education, which is a priority of mine. I was delighted \nto work with Chairman Roth to ensure that employer-provided educational \nassistance was retroactively reinstated and extended for graduate \neducation. However, I am troubled by the failure of the House to extend \nthe program for graduate-level study. I firmly believe that employer-\nprovided educational assistance should\n\n[[Page S7440]]\n\nbe a priority within this bill, and I hope that this can be resolved in \nconference.\n  I am very pleased to have had the opportunity to work with Members on \nboth sides of the aisle for the inclusion of the Spousal IRA Equity \nAct. For the first time, women who stay at home to care for the \nfamily's children will have the ability to place the same amount of \nmoney in a tax-free IRA as men who work outside the home. Each spouse, \nincluding whichever spouse is the family homemaker, will now have the \nopportunity to make a deductible IRA contribution of up to $2,000 a \nyear.\n  This bill partially corrects another problem area that affects \nmillions of women. Earlier this year, I introduced the Womens' Pension \nEquity Act of 1996. I am pleased to see that this small business tax \nlegislation includes two of the most important provisions from my \nwomen's pension bill. One provision requires the IRS to create a model \nform for spousal consent with respect to survivor annuities. Another \nprovision would require the Department of Labor to create a model \nqualified domestic relations order form.\n\n  Pensions are often the most valuable financial asset a couple owns--\nearned together during their years of marriage. Unfortunately, it is \nnow all too easy for a woman to unknowingly compromise her right to a \nshare of her spouse's pension benefits in case of divorce if both \nspouses do not sign a complete QDRO form. These provisions would make \nit more likely that women will be able to protect their rights to \npensions.\n  This legislation also extends for 6 months the currently expired \nexcise tax on commercial airline tickets. This 10-percent ticket tax \nhas historically been the principal source of funding for the aviation \ntrust fund. Since the tax expired last year, however, the fund has been \nwithout a revenue source, and has been spending down its balances.\n  The ticket excise tax was designed to ensure that users of our \naviation system played a major role in financing of the Federal \nAviation Administration, and these revenues have been used to help the \nFAA enhance airline safety, and ensure that the airline industry safely \nmeets the needs of the traveling public. Without this revenue, the \nlong-term ability of the FAA to perform its safety mission could be put \nat risk.\n  I therefore support the short-term extension of the ticket tax. \nHowever, commercial aviation has changed radically since the ticket tax \nwas first imposed in the 1970's. The old system may no longer be \nappropriate to today's aviation industry--or tomorrow's. I therefore \nurge the administration to use the 6-month period provided by this bill \nto evaluate whether the 10-percent excise tax on tickets should be \nextended for the long term in its current form, or whether it should be \nreplaced with another concept more attuned to the realities of the \nmodern aviation industry.\n  The financing system imposed by the Federal Government to pay for the \nFAA must build on the strengths of the dynamic American aviation \nindustry. I therefore strongly urge the administration to take the next \n6 months to review the current funding needs of the FAA, and work to \ncraft a permanent system for financing aviation that meets the \ninterests of the American traveling public and of all the other \nparticipants in that system.\n  There are a number of other features in this bill that make a lot of \nsense, and that will be of significant benefit to our country, but \nrather than speak further on provisions of the bill that already \ncommand broad, bipartisan support, I would instead like to address a \nfew issues that I believe need further review. Given the current floor \nsituation, it is not possible to fully address all of these issues here \non the Senate floor. That review will therefore necessarily have to \ntake place in the upcoming Senate-House conference.\n  The House bill, for example, contains a provision that would tax \nnonphysical compensatory damage awards. Under the House language, \nvictims of sex discrimination, race discrimination, and emotional \ndistress would be required to pay taxes on any damages they receive \nresulting from a successful lawsuit in any of these areas of the law. \nSingling out this category of damages for differential tax treatment is \nwrong and discriminatory, and it would make it more difficult for \npeople who suffer these harms both to access the court system and to \nachieve justice. I am therefore pleased and commend my colleagues in \nthe Senate for excluding this provision, and I hope that the Senate \nlanguage is adopted in conference.\n\n  The Research and Experimentation tax credit is another area that will \nneed careful attention in conference. I have worked hard with my \ncolleagues Senator Baucus and Senator Hatch to ensure that the R tax \ncredit is extended in the bill now before this body, and I am pleased \nthat the R tax credit will be extended effective July 1, 1996. \nHowever, I am deeply concerned by the fact that it was neither extended \nin the House version nor retroactively reinstated in the Finance \nCommittee to cover the gap created by our failure to act. The last \nextension of the credit expired on June 30, 1995, and based on six \nprior extensions of the credit, businesses had every reason to expect \nthat the credit would be extended without creating a gap where the \ncredit is not available. If Congress is now to reverse that series of \nprecedents, we might well create a chilling effect on business research \nand development investment. We need to make the R tax credit \npermanent, so that there will be no future gaps in the availability of \nthe credit.\n  The section 29 tax credit for nonconventional fuels is yet another \narea that needs further consideration. This tax credit is good for our \nenvironment. For example, recovering and managing landfill gas such as \nmethane has improved the quality of life around landfills, reduced \nsmog, and alleviates global warming. With this tax credit, landfill gas \nhas become a practical fuel for use in conventional electrical \ngenerating equipment. However, the extension of the credit will be less \neffective as it relates to coal unless the placed in service date is \nchanged from January 1, 1998 to January 1, 1999, given the scope and \ncomplexity involved in converting coal into synthetic fuels.\n  While I believe these issues need to be addressed, I want to \nreiterate that the bill as it was reported from the Finance Committee \nis a good bill. Women, children, and working people will all benefit if \nthis bill can be enacted, and it will help promote job creation and \neconomic growth. I want to commend my colleagues on the Finance \nCommittee, particularly Chairman Roth and the ranking Democratic \nmember, Senator Moynihan, who have worked hard to produce a bipartisan \nbill that promotes growth and stability among small businesses.\n  I will speak separately on the minimum wage amendments that have been \noffered to this bill. At this time I only want to remind all of my \nColleagues that this bill will not and cannot become law if this body \npasses a minimum wage provision that works against the interests of \nworking Americans. I therefore urge all of my colleagues to vote for \nthe minimum wage amendment being offered by the distinguished Senator \nfrom Massachusetts, Senator Kennedy, and against any attempts to \nundermine this long overdue, and very modest increase in the minimum \nwage.\n  The Finance Committee worked in a bipartisan way to create a bill \nthat commands broad support. It is a bill of which we can be proud, and \nof which the American people can be proud. If we continue the \nbipartisanship that brought the bill this year, if we continue to work \ntogether to put the interests of the American people first, we can \nensure that this bill remains bipartisan, and that it becomes law. The \nalternative, to continue a politics of confrontation and gridlock, is \nnot in the public interest, not in our national interest, and will \nresult in creating another legislative failure out of what would \notherwise be a significant legislative success. I strongly urge my \ncolleagues not to let that happen. I urge my colleagues to cast votes \nbased on the bipartisanship that has brought the bill this far. I urge \nthe Senate to vote against gridlock and for the American people, so \nthat this bill can become law.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I rise today in strong support of the \nKennedy amendment and as a cosponsor of the minimum wage increase.\n  I cannot sit idle as I hear of those struggling to live on today's \nminimum wage. I thought, like many of you, that the minimum wage earner \nwas my\n\n[[Page S7441]]\n\ndaughter or one of her friends: a teenager flipping burgers or taking \nfood orders to earn some extra cash for new clothes or a movie.\n  That is the misperception though. The sad fact is that 73 percent of \nthose earning between $4.25 and $5.14 an hour are over the age of 20. \nThat represents 9 million adults who will attempt to live on $8,840 \nthis year. One-third of these adults are the sole income-earners in \ntheir families. If these adults were supporting a family of three, they \nwould fall $2,682 below the Federal poverty line.\n  I am immensely troubled with the fact that 58 percent of those \nstruggling with a minimum wage are women; 5.2 million women, many of \nthese single mothers, would benefit directly from this increase.\n  These single moms are trying. Trying to raise two kids on a below-\npoverty income. And how does Congress reward these single parents? By \nattacking Medicaid that would have paid for her son's asthma medicine. \nBy cutting her child care support that allows her to work. By taking \naway funding for nutrition programs that pay for her kids to eat at \nschool or day care. By eliminating her Head Start Program that gives \nher kids a chance at starting school ready to learn. By refusing to add \n90 cents to her hourly wage--a wage that pays for heat, clothing, and \nfood.\n  Aren't these the individuals and families we are trying to keep \nemployed and off of Federal support? Instead, this Congress has \ntargeted the low-income family through cut after cut and a resistance \nto move them above the poverty line.\n  This amendment does not eliminate jobs, it barely keeps people \nworking, who otherwise would be completely reliant on public support. \nIf we had only passed this amendment a year ago, it would have meant \nthat the single mother would have earned an additional $2,000 today. To \nthat low-income family, that would have meant more than 7 months of \ngroceries, 4 months of rent, a full year of health care costs, or 9 \nmonths of utility bills.\n  I did not reach my decision to support the minimum wage easily. I \nhave listened carefully to the concerns of small business owners from \nacross my State, who have highlighted the implications of this \nincrease. I don't want to see prices for the American consumer rise or \njobs eliminated. But I don't think an increase to the minimum wage will \nend employment in small business, either.\n  It has now been over 5 years since the last minimum wage increase. We \nmust remember that the value of the current minimum wage has fallen by \nnearly 50 cents since 1991 and is now 27 percent lower than it was in \n1979. Now is the time to adjust that inequality and demonstrate a true \ncommitment to our working families.\n  A slight increase in this wage provides those who work hard and play \nby the rules an increased opportunity and a chance to succeed. If any \nof my colleagues oppose the minimum wage, I urge them to live on $8,840 \nthis year and then reconsider their vote.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise to support increasing the \nminimum wage from the current floor of $4.25 to $5.15 per hour, the 90-\ncent increase being phased-in in two stages over the next year.\n  This issue is about making ends meet. It's about people being able to \npay the rent and put food on the table, and the bottom line is, the \ncurrent minimum wage is simply not enough to live on.\n  A person working full time at minimum wage today does not even make \nenough money to meet the Federal poverty level. An American working a \n40-hour week makes an annual salary of $8,640--nearly $300 below the \nFederal poverty level of $8,910. For a family of two, the poverty level \nis $11,920.\n  The minimum wage is supposed to be a safeguard against poverty-level \nwages, but for millions of Americans, the cost of living has outpaced \nany protection afforded by the minimum wage.\n  Many families in this country are just one paycheck away from \ndisaster--whether it is an illness, the need to move, or simply the car \nbreaking down--many people living paycheck to paycheck live in fear \nthat they may not make it this month or the next. They live in dread of \nthe next heat wave that could force them to choose between paying the \nextra-high electric bill or buying the kids a new pair of shoes.\n  We don't have a magic wand to fix their situation, but in my view we \ndo have an obligation to maintain a minimum wage level that, at the \nvery least, keeps pace with the cost of living.\n  Let me give you an example of what raising the minimum wage just 90 \ncents would mean to a family:\n  It means $1,800 more money every year; enough to pay 4 months of \nrent; enough to cover health care costs for a whole year; enough to pay \n9 months of utility bills; and enough to buy 7 months worth of \ngroceries.\n  Maintaining a minimum wage that makes sense is especially important \nfor States like mine with a higher than average cost of living:\n  A loaf of bread in Los Angeles, at $1.34, is double that of the \nUnited States average of 75 cents.\n  A gallon of milk in the United States costs $1.41 on average, but in \nSan Diego it costs $1.71.\n  A can of tuna that costs 69 cents on average costs 90 cents in San \nDiego.\n  In San Francisco, housing costs are 160 percent higher than the \nnational average.\n  The cost of health care in Los Angeles is 37 percent higher than the \nnational average.\n  The cost of transportation is 22 percent higher and there a fewer \nlower cost alternatives.\n  The minimum wage does not just affect teens who are working their \nfirst job. Seventy percent of Americans who receive the minimum wage \nare adults over 20 years old. Forty percent are the sole breadwinner in \ntheir family and more than three of every five are women, many of whom \nare single women supporting a family.\n  A decent wage has long been a hallmark of this country's promise. It \nmeans a livable wage for a fair day's work. It means providing for your \nfamily and staying off welfare. A decent minimum wage honors work. I \nhope my colleagues will join me in passing this amendment. It will mean \na great deal to a lot of hard-working Americans.\n  Mr. HATFIELD. Mr. President, I agree that Congress should increase \nthe minimum wage standard. I have voted for reasonable minimum wage \nincreases in the past and will certainly vote for the reasonable \nincrease of the minimum wage today.\n  As this Congress discusses welfare reform, it has been emphasized \ntime and time again that those who can work should work. However, with \nthe minimum wage today at $4.25 an hour, a person laboring 8 hours a \nday, 5 days a week, 52 weeks a year would gross only $8,840. The \nminimum wage is already very close to its lowest real value in over 40 \nyears. In addition, paired with inflation, the minimum wage increase of \n1989 has been virtually nullified. If the minimum wage in January 1978 \nhad kept pace with the Consumer Price Index, for example, the current \nlevel would be $6.40 in 1996. If we expect those on welfare to work, we \ncan at least ensure that a minimum wage is a living wage and by voting \nfor an increase in the minimum wage today we will have taken steps to \nassure those who are working are justly compensated for their work.\n  The minimum wage, established in 1938 by the Fair Labor Standards Act \nhas been raised 17 times, more recently in 1989 and 1991. I voted both \nfor final passage and the conference report of the wage increases in \n1989, which raised the minimum wage to $3.80, and 1991, which raised it \nto its current level. A minimum wage provides vital protection for \nthose workers who are not union members or who have few if any skills \nand little bargaining power. With bipartisan support, Congress should \nraise the minimum wage to $5.15 per hour and I support that increase.\n\n\n           clarification of section 4271 aviation excise tax\n\n  Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, H.R. 3448 reinstates all airport and airway \ntrust fund excise taxes, including the section 4271 tax on the \ntransportation of property by air. In Revenue Ruling 80-53, the \nInternal Revenue Service clarified that this excise tax does not apply \nto charges paid by the U.S. Postal Service for accessorial ground \nservices. Although the Internal Revenue Service has followed the same \ninterpretation in an unpublished ruling involving a commercial carrier, \nthere seems to be confusion about the application of section\n\n[[Page S7442]]\n\n4271 to commercial integrated carriers that provide accessorial ground \nservices, in addition to air transportation.\n  In reinstating section 4271 excise tax, is it your view, Senator \nThompson, that the statutory language of section 4271 is to be \ninterpreted and applied to commercial carriers in accordance with the \nholding of Revenue Ruling 80-53--i.e., that amounts reasonably \nattributable to accessorial ground services of commercial carriers are \nnot taxable under section 4271? If you agree with this statement, would \nyou also agree that any uncertainty about the present or future \napplication of section 4271 to commercial carriers should now be \neliminated.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. I agree.\n\n\n                  SBIC Participating Security Program\n\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be allowed to \nengage in a colloquy with the managers of the bill and the Senator from \nArkansas [Mr. Bumpers], regarding a correction that is needed for the \nSmall Business Investment Company Participating Security Program.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BOND. This is an issue that arose so recently that it has proven \nimpossible to address it in this small business tax bill, even though \nthis would be the perfect forum for it because it is a tax issue having \na serious impact on SBIC's. So we are hopeful that this issue can be \ntaken care of in the conference committee on the small business tax \nbill.\n  Specifically, we are talking about a correction that is critical to \nthe continuation of the newest form of SBIC: the participating \nsecurities SBIC. The need for and the language of the correction are \nsupported by Treasury, SBA, and the SBIC industry.\n  As you know, Mr. President, SBIC's are small, privately managed and \nprivately capitalized venture capital firms that are licensed by SBA to \ninvest solely in U.S. small businesses. In return for their agreement \nto invest and to put 100 percent of their private capital at risk \nbefore Government funds are at risk, SBIC's are eligible to draw \nadditional capital, or leverage, which is raised by the sale of SBA-\nguaranteed certificates. Leverage is repaid with interest, and a share \nof the profits in the case of participating securities SBIC's, as \ninvestments mature. At a time when strictly private venture capital \nfunds are less and less inclined to invest in the $250,000 to $3 \nmillion range critical to small businesses and more and more interested \nin investing in foreign companies which compete with our U.S. small \nbusinesses, the need for the SBIC program is perhaps greater than ever.\n  The participating securities SBIC is a new form of SBIC financing \nthat was created by Congress in 1992 to stimulate equity, vis-a-vis \ndebt, investment in small U.S. businesses. With that legislation, \nCongress created not only a vehicle that has attracted substantial \nprivate capital for equity investment in small U.S. companies, but also \ncreated the mechanism by which the U.S. Treasury--and thereby the \ntaxpayers--share directly in profits made by these SBIC's from their \ninvestments. To date, 35 participating securities SBIC's with $565 \nmillion in private capitalization operating in 17 States have been \nlicensed by the SBA. By the close of fiscal year 1996, it is estimated \nthat the Government will have received over $500,000 in profits over \nand above principal and interest factors from these new SBIC's. When \none considers that nonprofit sharing SBIC's provided early financing to \ncompanies such as Apple Computer, Intel, Federal Express, and Cray \nResearch, it is understandable why so many are excited about this new \nform of industry-led partnership with Government. It is a true \npartnership that will see U.S. taxpayers share both directly and \nindirectly in the profits associated with the creation of new jobs, \ntechnologies, and overall economic development by the small firms in \nwhich SBICs invest.\n  As referenced above, leverage funds for participating securities \nSBIC's are raised quarterly by sale of SBA-guaranteed certificates by a \nfunding trust set up for this purpose. The certificates are 10-year \nobligations with interest payable quarterly. Because the participating \nsecurities issued by SBIC's to the trust in return for the leverage \nraised by the trust's certificate sales are equities which do not \nrequire the SBIC's to pay any amounts unless they have earnings, which \nthey likely will not have while holding the stock of the small \ncompanies they invest in, the SBA's guarantee of the payment of both \nregular interest and principal is the critical element which supports \nthe sale of the certificates through public capital markets. In \nrecognition of SBA's guarantee as the primary reliance factor for \ninvestors, in all fundings to date, the Internal Revenue Service, \nthrough private letter rulings, has characterized the SBA-guaranteed \ncertificates sold by the trust as obligations of the U.S. Government \nand not as those of the participating securities SBIC's being funded by \nthe trust. These rulings have supported the six sales that have \noccurred thus far in the short history of the new program.\n  At this point, Mr. President, I wanted to ask my good friend from \nArkansas, Senator Bumpers, a question regarding the intent behind the \nenabling legislation for this program when it was passed in 1992. \nBecause the Senator from Arkansas was chairman of the Small Business \nCommittee at that time, he is probably better qualified than anyone in \nthis body to opine on this matter. And my question is this: Was the \nintent of the enabling legislation for the participating securities \nprogram that the SBA-guaranteed certificates sold by the trust were to \nbe obligations of the U.S. Government and not obligations of the \nparticipating securities SBIC's being funded by the trust?\n\n  Mr. BUMPERS. That was certainly my intent, and I believe the intent \nof the members of the Small Business Committees of both the House and \nSenate, when we acted on this legislation in 1992. I feel confident \nthat this was the understanding of the other Members of this Chamber, \nas well. Frankly, to treat these certificates as debt instruments \nbacked by the full faith and credit of the United States is the only \nway to make this program work. If they were not, the investors would \ndemand a far higher return on their investment because the risk would \nbe significantly higher. And the important aspect of that fact at \npresent is that without this change, the cost of this program to the \nFederal Government will be substantially more. The consequences of \nfailing to cure the definitional defect are severe. Either future \nleverage fundings would be impossible, thereby directly ending the \nprogram, or the uncertainty surrounding the nature of the certificates \nwould dramatically increase their cost, thereby effectively ending the \nprogram in our view. Not only would a valuable program have been killed \nunnecessarily, but the Government might be liable for unfunded leverage \ncommitments outstanding at this time, perhaps as much as $90 million, \nand, perhaps, losses of the $565 million in private capital that has \nbeen committed to the program to date in reliance on the availability \nof leverage capital at reasonable rates. For this to happen because of \na lack of definitional clarity would be unfortunate indeed.\n  Mr. BOND. So this characterization of the SBA-guaranteed certificates \nsold to the public as U.S. Government debt is what permits the \ncertificates to be sold to the broadest possible base at the lowest \npossible interest rates.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. That is correct. And currently the rate is the rate for \n10-year Treasury bonds plus approximately 75 basis points.\n  Mr. ROTH. If I might ask a question at this point, it is my \nunderstanding that heretofore, the IRS has been willing to confirm that \nthese certificates are debt obligations of the United States \nGovernment. Is that correct?\n  Mr. BOND. That is correct. The IRS has provided private letter \nrulings to that effect on six occasions in the past. Unfortunately, \njust last week, the IRS made a final decision that it is unwilling to \ngive a permanent revenue ruling that would so characterize the \ncertificates for all time. The IRS believes that the language of the \nstatute is ambiguous with respect to congressional intent and fears \nthat a ruling based on the ambiguous language might have negative \nconsequences in non-SBIC areas. However, notwith-standing this \nunwillingness of IRS to issue a revenue ruling, the Department of \nTreasury is not opposed to a legislative correction to clear up the \nissue of congressional intent.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. If I could make one inquiry of the Senator from \nMissouri.\n\n[[Page S7443]]\n\n There is significant time sensitivity to this issue, is there not? \nWhat happens to the SBIC Participating Security Program if we do not \nresolve this issue soon?\n  Mr. BOND. It could be in trouble by the end of the year. Without \nclarifying language, it could well be impossible to sell any more \ncertificates following the August 1996 quarterly offering. And let me \nadd that the reason this issue was not raised earlier was that, up \nuntil last week, the SBA and IRS believed it could be worked out \nadministratively. But at that time, the IRS determined it needed a \nlegislative fix, and that is why we are here today. We have asked the \nJoint Committee on Taxation for a revenue request, which we hope will \nbe ready post-haste.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Well, this is certainly an issue that needs to be \naddressed.\n  Mr. ROTH. I thank the Senator from Missouri and the Senator from \nArkansas for bringing this matter to our attention. Although the \nParticipating Security Program is relatively new, it appears to have \ngreat potential for small business. Let us see what we can do to \nresolve this issue.\n  Mr. BOND. I thank the managers and my friend from Arkansas for taking \nthe time to discuss this important issue.\n\n\n                    disallowance for business meals\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I would like to engage the chairman of the \nFinance Committee in a colloquy regarding a provision in the Small \nBusiness Job Protection Act.\n  Section 1120 of the act provides an exception from the 50 percent \ndisallowance for business meals for certain remote seafood processing \nfacilities.\n  It is my understanding that this provision is intended to address a \nspecific issue related to these seafood processing facilities, and is \nnot intended to imply congressional intent on other exceptions to the \n50 percent disallowance on business meals claimed by taxpayers.\n  Mr. ROTH. The Senator is correct.\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. Mr. President, I rise today to talk about just a \nfew of the compelling reasons that this Congress should support a real \nincrease in the minimum wage.\n  By raising the minimum wage, this Congress can close the ever \nincreasing gap between the working people of this country and the \nwealthy, help ensure that there is a market for all the goods and \nservices the workers of this country produce, stop paying assistance \nand start collecting taxes, and honor the American tradition of \nrewarding hard work and perseverance.\n  The current minimum wage is not a living wage for the millions of \nAmerican's who support themselves and their families on $4.25 an hour. \nToday, 10 million Americans earn the minimum wage--well below the \npoverty line for a family. In my State alone, over 10 percent of the \nwork force earns the minimum wage--545,647 Illinoisans earn $4.25 an \nhour. This means that an Illinoisan, working 40 hours a week, 52 weeks \na year, earns only $8,840.\n  The legislation we are considering today would increase the minimum \nwage by 90 cents over the next year. It has been almost 5 years since \nthe minimum wage was last increased. During this time, the real value \nof the minimum wage has, of course, declined. While wages have stayed \nthe same, prices have increased, as I'm sure anybody who has gone to \nthe grocery store or the doctor's office lately can tell you. It is no \nwonder then, that the working people of this country are faced with a \ndeclining standard of living.\n  As I have pointed out to the Senate before, in the 1980's, 80 percent \nof Americans did not improve their standard of living. While the \naverage wage increased 67 percent, the average price of a home \nincreased by 100 percent, the average price of a car increased 125 \npercent, and the cost of a year in college increased by 130 percent. \nThe minimum wage increased by only 23 percent. In fact, a recent study \nstated that the decline in the value of the minimum wage since 1979 \naccounted for between a 20- and 30-percent increase in wage inequality \nin this country.\n  It is important to understand that workers earning the minimum wage \nare not just young people working at their first job--although many \nyoung people contribute to their family's income.\n\n  The majority of the people earning the minimum wage--two-thirds--are \nadults. Many of these are parents raising families on under $9,000 a \nyear. The poverty rate for a family of four is $15,600.\n  Close to 60 percent of those earning minimum wage are women. These \nare women who are taking responsibility for themselves and their \nchildren. They go to work every single day, and still the minimum wage \ndoes not provide them with a living wage on which to raise their \nfamilies. It is a travesty that a mother or father working full time--\n40 hours a week, 52 weeks a year--cannot support a family or get out of \npoverty, no matter how hard they work.\n  A 90-cent increase in the minimum wage would provide a full-time \nworker earning the minimum wage with $1,800 a year in additional \nincome. That money could pay more than 7 months of groceries, rent or \nmortgage for 4 months, a full year of health care, or 9 months of \nutility bills for a family living on the minimum wage. The money would \nmake a world of difference to that family. That money would also be \npart of the economy.\n  A family that can pay for rent, groceries, or health care is putting \nmoney back into the economy. That family is buying goods and services \nproduced by other workers. That family is also earning taxable income \nand reducing the need for public assistance. An increase in the minimum \nwage helps people to contribute to, rather than drain, the Nation's \neconomy.\n  It is not only the lowest paid workers who will benefit from this \nincrease. All those who earn a dollar or two above the minimum wage \nshould see their income rise. This will increase the pool of consumers, \nincrease taxable earnings, and improve the lives of countless American \nfamilies.\n  Paying a living wage does not mean that jobs will be lost. Last year, \na group of respected economists, including three Nobel Prize winners, \nconcluded that an increase in the minimum wage to $5.15 an hour will \nhave positive effects on the labor market, workers, and the economy. \nAny job loss is negligible compared to the benefits an increase in the \nminimum wage would produce.\n  Some argue that small businesses should be exempt from the minimum \nwage increase. We should remember that the minimum wage bill is \nattached to the Small Business Jobs Protection Act of 1996, a bill that \nprovides $6.5 billion in tax benefits for small businesses over 10 \nyears.\n  Even more to the point, however, is the fact that small businesses \nwhich right now pay a living wage to their employees are at a \ncompetitive disadvantage to those which do not. By setting a floor, a \nminimum wage, we will level the field for business. If there is a \nconsistent basic wage among businesses, no worker's livelihood will \nbecome the basis for competitive advantage. We should help small \nbusinesses to pay a living wage, not allow them to be penalized if they \ndo so.\n  Workers are our greatest resource. The American worker is more \nlasting and more valuable than all our coal and oil. The American \nworker made this country great. We should recognize the contributions \nof our workers and reward those who work long and hard to earn a \nliving. We must be especially careful to ensure that those workers \ncaring for children are able to do so. Parents working full time to \nsupport their families must be able to support their families.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote against the Bond amendment. That \namendment strips the wage increase of any real meaning by providing \nexceptions and loopholes that will leave millions of workers without \nthe minimum wage increase they deserve.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote for the Kennedy amendment. This \namendment covers more of America's minimum wage workers with less \ndelay. This amendment responds to the wishes of the American people and \nprovides a real increase in the minimum wage.\n  Our country is founded on the belief that hard work is the foundation \nof success--this is the American dream. Congress should encourage, not \ndiscourage, effort and perseverance. A minimum wage should provide a \nliving wage for those who are working day in and day out to provide for \nthemselves and their families. Family values and\n\n[[Page S7444]]\n\nthe American dream are ideas we like to talk about, but today we can \nactually make them more real for millions of Americans.\n  Mr. MACK. Mr. President, I rise today in support of S. 295, the \nTeamwork for Employees and Management Act.\n  This bill, which I am proud to cosponsor, amends the National Labor \nRelations Board Act to permit teams of employees in nonunion settings \nto work with management to address workplace issues of mutual interest. \nUnder current law, only union representatives can represent workers in \ncommunication with management.\n  In an article in this week's edition of the AFL-CIO News, union \nmembers were urged to call their Senators and tell them that ``the TEAM \nAct is an underhanded effort to prevent workers from forming unions.'' \nThis is simply false. The TEAM Act merely gives non-union workers an \neffective voice for change in the workplace. In essence, the bill \nextends the same rights to non-union workers which union members \nalready possess. How can that be such a bad idea?\n  Employee participation on labor/management teams gives them the \nopportunity to make significant and valuable contributions to their \ncompanies. Employee involvement teams are about respect and fairness \nfor all workers. Today's worker's have much to offer about the work \nthey perform, and employers have learned to listen to them.\n  Even President Clinton agreed with this concept. In his 1996 State of \nthe Union Message he said: ``When companies and workers work as a team, \nthey do better--and so does America.'' I could not agree more.\n  Mr. President, there are many difficult issues facing America's work \nforce. One area which should be neither challenging nor stressful is \nthe relationship between labor and management. I believe that Congress \nmust offer policies which improve the quality of work life and reduce \nthe tension between managers and workers. The TEAM Act is such a \nproposal. This bill intends to break down the communication barriers \nbetween employers and employees, and as a result, establish more \ncooperative labor/management relationships in American companies.\n  Mr. President, I urge my colleagues' support of this legislation. \nAmerican laws should be designed to stimulate and encourage cooperation \nand teamwork in the work force, rather than suppress such activities. \nThe time has come to pass the TEAM Act.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, millions of Americans worry about their \nability to retire, pay the bills and not be a burden to their children. \nSome worry because their employer is unable to provide them with a \npension. Others worry about whether their existing pensions will be \nthere for them when they retire.\n  This bill is a blessing for all of these workers. It will make it \neasier for people to get pensions and will protect pensions of those \nwho already have them.\n  Thirty-six million Americans work for small businesses that can't \nafford to provide pensions to their employees. These 36 million people \nwill benefit from the simple pension plan created in this legislation. \nThis plan allows small businesses tax-favored treatment when they \nestablish pension plans for their workers, and it eliminates most of \nthe redtape associated with creating a pension plan.\n  Two million Americans who work for tax-exempt organizations will, for \nthe first time, be eligible to sign up for 401(k) savings plans.\n  In addition to pension reforms, the bill includes provisions that \nhelp small businesses and their workers. They include creation of the \nwork opportunity credit designed to encourage the hiring of hard-to-\nplace workers, and an increase in expensing for small business to help \nthe Nation's job creators grow and create more jobs. The work \nopportunity tax credit replaces the targeted jobs tax credit which I \nhelped author. The reforms update that legislation.\n  The bill changes the S corporation laws to make it easier for \nfamilies to maintain their enterprises and the bill extends a popular \ntax provision that allows employers to provide their workers with \neducational assistance on a tax-favored basis.\n  This bill also includes an expansion of IRA provisions for homemakers \nso that they can contribute $2,000 to an IRA.\n  The bill and managers' amendment also extends the R tax credit \nthrough December 31, 1997.\n  Out of the six areas of tax law, the most complex for small business \nowners are the independent contractor rules, depreciation, alternative \nminimum tax, inventory accounting, pension rules, and the home office \ndeduction.\n  This bill addresses the independent contractor rules and pension \nrules. This is a very good start.\n  The tax title contains revenue offsets to pay for the relief granted \nto small businesses and pensions. The bill reduces the deficit by $100 \nmillion in 1996 and by $1.1 billion in 1997.\n  A few of the revenue offsets are from the vetoed Balanced Budget Act: \nreform of section 936 possessions tax credit, repeal of the 50-percent \nexclusion for financial institution loans, elimination of the interest \nallocation exception for certain nonfinancial corporations, revision of \nthe expatriation tax rules.\n  The bill also reinstates the airport and airway trust fund taxes \nthrough April 15, 1997.\n  This bill contains many tax provisions passed by Congress last year \nin the Balanced Budget Act which was vetoed by President Clinton.\n  Congress believes that it is worth sending the small business tax \nrelief to the President again in this minimum wage bill.\n  Despite the current tax burden, small business is the fastest \ngrowing, most vibrant sector of our economy. The bill provides much \nneeded relief so that businesses can create even more new jobs.\n  I hope that next Congress we will enact comprehensive tax reform. \nInstead of limited expensing, there could be expensing and no \ndepreciation calculation. We would eliminate the alternative minimum \ntax and get rid of inventory accounting.\n  If we enacted the USA tax plan introduced by Senator Nunn and me the \nTax Code would get much simpler.\n  There are 5 million employers in the United States today. Some 60 \npercent employ 4 employees or fewer and 94 percent employ fewer than 50 \nemployees.\n  Tax regulations and compliance burden ranks highest among small \nbusiness people's problems and concerns.\n  A recent NFIB tax survey found that 79 percent of those responding \nsaid we should substantially change the Federal Tax Code as it affects \nboth business and individuals.\n  Current code smothers small business.\n  Arthur Hall of the Tax Foundation found that small business owners--\nsmall corporations with assets less than $1 million--pay a minimum of \n$724 in compliance costs for every $100 paid in income taxes. This is a \ntotal of $28.6 billion in compliance costs for these small business \nowners, compared to $3.9 billion paid in income tax.\n  Additionally, small firms bear a compliance burden at least 24 times \ngreater than big business.\n  There is growing recognition by politicians, economists, and all \ncitizens alike of a disturbing fact--the burden created by Federal \nincome tax and other Federal regulations falls predominantly and \ndisproportionately on the very people who we rely upon to create jobs--\nsmall business owners.\n  Endless paperwork associated with tax regulations takes more and more \ntime, allowing less and less time to run their businesses.\n  The alternative minimum tax and depreciation calculations mean \nendless hours of work and high accountants fees, often for little \nbottom line tax benefit.\n  Additionally, 53 percent said payroll taxes are less fair or much \nless fair than business income taxes.\n  One-half of small business owners start their business with less than \n$20,000, most of which is from personal savings or family savings. The \nunlimited savings allowance in the USA tax will make it much easier for \nentrepreneurs to get started. This means more new businesses and more \nnew jobs.\n  I am pleased to support the tax title of this bill; however, we need \ncomprehensive reform.\n\n\n           Providing Equal Tax Treatment To Software Exports\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am disappointed that the tax package in \nthe\n\n[[Page S7445]]\n\nSmall Business Job Protection Act, H.R. 3448, does not include any \nprovisions to correct the foreign sales corporation tax to provide \nequal treatment to computer software exports.\n  I believe the managers of the bill, Senator Moynihan and Senator \nRoth, have done a fine job on the tax provisions in this legislation, \nexcept for this one issue. I want to thank Senator Moynihan for his \nsupport and I will continue to work with him and other Senators to \ncorrect this tax discrimination because it has hampered the \ncompetitiveness of our software industry for far too long.\n  In 1971, before the birth of the software industry, Congress created \ntax incentives for U.S. companies to bolster exports. In an \nincreasingly competitive global economy, Congress realized that U.S. \nbusinesses must export to succeed. Since 1987, however, the Treasury \nDepartment has interpreted the law to exclude most U.S. software \nexporters from receiving these benefits.\n  Correcting this inequity will protect U.S. software development jobs \nand encourage economic growth through increased software exports. The \nUnited States is currently the world leader in software development, \ncreating more than 500,000 high-wage, high-skill jobs in this country. \nOur tax policy should be encouraging the creation of more of these \njobs, not hindering the ability of our software companies to compete in \nthe global economy.\n  Correcting this problem does not grant special treatment to the \nsoftware industry. It would merely restore equal treatment under \nexisting law. Fixing this anomaly in our tax law makes economic and \ncommon sense. I urge my colleagues to provide equal tax treatment to \nsoftware exports as soon as possible.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I am voting to raise the minimum wage. \nThis increase in the minimum wage is long overdue. While opponents have \ntried to kill this increase, inflation has killed the value of the \ncurrent wage.\n  The bill before us today has two major components. First of all, it \nraises the minimum wage from $4.25 an hour to $5.15 an hour. This is a \nmajor step in improving paycheck security for America's workers.\n  Second, the bill contains a number of tax provisions. Many of these \nprovisions are designed to benefit small business, and to address \nconcerns that small business might be hurt by the wage increase the \nbill provides.\n  One tax provision of special importance to me is the language that \nexpands the availability of spousal IRAs. Along with Senator Kay Bailey \nHutchison, I am the author of the Homemaker IRA Bill. Sixty of our \ncolleagues have joined in cosponsoring our bill to allow homemakers to \nget a full IRA deduction. So we are delighted that our bill, which is \nso important in providing retirement security for American families, \nhas been included in this legislation.\n  If this Congress fails to raise the minimum wage, we will be letting \ndown millions of hard working men and women. We will be letting down \nthe 130,000 Maryland workers who will benefit from an increase.\n  The last time we acted to raise the minimum wage was 1989. When we \nadd in what inflation has done to that increase in the last 7 years, \nthe minimum wage is at its lowest level since 1955--40 years. How many \nin this Chamber would be satisfied with 1955 wages?\n  When I say I am for a minimum wage increase I want to make clear that \nI will not vote for the Republican amendment. The Republican amendment \nis an attempt to have it both ways. Tell the voters you voted for an \nincrease, but don't tell them that the millions of working men and \nwomen who need the increase will never get it. Under the Republican \namendment, two thirds of all workplaces--and 10.5 million employees--\nwould be denied the minimum wage increase.\n  The Republican amendment delays the increase for another half year. \nIt effectively cuts out all waiters and waitresses, and others who \ndepend on tips. This is a particular concern to women. Women represent \nsome 80 percent of tipped employees.\n  The Republican amendment denies an increase to every worker, \nregardless of age, for the first 6 months on any new job. The \nRepublican amendment will not result in an increase in the minimum wage \nbut it will result in an increase in the public cynicisms about \nWashington.\n\n  The Democratic amendment is straightforward, and it will raise the \nminimum wage. Under our proposal the minimum wage will increase from \n$4.25 an hour to $5.15 an hour by the second year. This is a modest \nproposal that will not kill jobs, but will help America's families.\n  Mr. President, some will argue that the minimum wage doesn't really \nhelp families or adult workers, but that is not what the facts tell us. \nThe facts are that over 60 percent of workers receiving the minimum \nwage are adults. And over one-third of minimum wage earners are the \nonly wage earners in their families.\n  Too many workers are losing ground. Too many people are working \nlonger and working harder, but their checks are getting smaller. These \npeople don't work on Wall Street and they don't work in this Chamber, \nbut they do work in every corner of the United States and every place \nin between. They live their lives trying to meet their day to day \nneeds. In a country where voters wonder if Washington is interested in \nimproving their lives, raising the minimum wage is one small signal we \ncan send that says we do care.\n  Mr. President, I also want to mention my support for the small \nbusiness tax package that will become a part of this legislation if it \nis passed. I am pleased that we have a bipartisan agreement on a tax \npackage that will provide some needed tax changes.\n  Some have denounced a minimum wage increase as being antibusiness. \nThese same people fail to mention the nearly $11 billion in tax cuts \nthat are a part of this legislation. Extension of the research, \neducation, and targeted tax credits are all important tax deductions \nthat I have long supported. I believe the continuation of these credits \nwill help businesses as well as help the country.\n  I am also very pleased that this tax package includes an expansion of \nthe IRA for spouses. I want to take this opportunity to commend Senator \nHutchison, with whom I introduced the bill early last year to provide \nhomemaker IRA's. Senator Hutchison has been such an able and staunch \nadvocate for our legislation, and I am pleased that it is included in \nthe bill before us. By passing this we are finally recognizing the \nvalue of the labor of all the spouses who work at home.\n  Mr. President lets pass a minimum wage increase. One that is real and \none that is needed.\n  Mrs. FRAHM. Mr. President, few would disagree that small businesses \nare the backbone of the American economy. From the mom-and-pop general \nstore, to the diner on Main Street, small businesses play an integral \nrole in keeping our economy moving. In fact, these enterprises create \nhalf of all of the new jobs created in this country.\n  The greatest obstacle facing small business today is the Federal \nGovernment itself. Ronald Reagan had it clear in his mind when he said \nwhat the test of an economic program should be: ``Government has an \nimportant role in helping develop a country's economic foundation. But \nthe critical test is whether the Government is genuinely working to \nliberate individuals by creating incentives to work, save, invest and \nsucceed.''\n  Sweeping tax reform is the only way to truly unleash America's \npotential and free small business from the burden of Government while \nencouraging savings, investment and real prosperity. However, until we \nhave someone in the White House who puts the interests of small \nbusinesses and the American people before politics, this type of \ncomplete tax reform seems impossible.\n  In the meantime, passing the Small Business Job Protection Act \nprovides immediate and meaningful relief for small businesses in Kansas \nand the rest of the Nation. The specific provisions of this bill will \nenable small businesses to increase capital investments, enhance job \nand overall economic growth, and provide retirement savings options for \ntheir employees. This is the proper role of Government.\n  People are worried about the economy and more specifically their \nfinancial futures. When I talk to Kansans, one thing is abundantly \nclear--people are fearful of their post-employment futures. They wonder \nif they will be able to afford to retire despite all of\n\n[[Page S7446]]\n\ntheir years of hard work. For many the only option is to work until \nthey no longer can. The American dream of a secure retirement becomes \nmore and more of a dream and less of a reality every day.\n  Currently, complex regulations and the resulting high costs keep \nsmall businesses from offering retirement plans to their employees. \nOnly 19 percent of workers in businesses with fewer than 25 employees \nhad employer provided pensions made available to them, and only 14 \npercent participated. A major contributing factor to this dismal \nstatistic is the sky-high cost per participant of establishing and \nmaintaining these pensions.\n  This bill will fix this situation, making pensions accessible to more \nAmericans, and helping to secure their financial futures. A lifetime of \nhard work should be accompanied by the earned reward of a secure \nretirement.\n\n  To me, Kansas common sense dictates that our policy toward small \nbusiness should support creation and growth, In fact, during the \n1980's, they accounted for an increase of more than 20 million jobs \nalone--20 million. It is vital that we look to protect America's small \nenterprises. We cannot afford to send hard-working Americans to the \nunemployment lines.\n  However, I am very concerned that a mandatory increase in the minimum \nwage, will excessively raise labor costs, forcing employers to either \nclose down or dramatically decrease the number of people that they \nemploy.\n  We must remember that protecting small business protects small \nbusiness employees. A minimum wage increase without substantial \nprotection for small business will destroy hundreds of thousands of \nentry-level and low-wage jobs. Many Americans rely on these jobs for \ntheir very survival.\n  The solution here is not the quick fix of simply paying individuals a \nbit more per hour--the prudent, long-range solution is providing these \nindividuals with the training they need to land higher paying jobs. A \nminimum wage increase will substantially decrease the funds that small \nemployers will be able to spend on the training of entry-level \nemployees to prepare them for higher paying jobs.\n  Although I oppose any effort to increase the Federal minimum wage, I \ncertainly support Senator Bond's small business exemption provisions. \nSince small enterprises are the hardest hit by a minimum wage increase, \nthey are in the greatest need of relief to continue to be competitive.\n  If we are going to pass legislation that makes such important strides \nin protecting small business, and more importantly, the people who \ndepend on them--we cannot take a giant step backward by simply creating \nnew obstacles for these hard-working entrepreneurs to overcome.\n  Again, raising the minimum wage is not the feel-good cure-all. \nHowever, tax relief and a minimum exemption for small business are \nsteps in the right direction. Any minimum wage increase must be coupled \nwith such provisions if we are to keep hard-working Americans from a \ntrip to the unemployment office.\n  It is my top priority to help bring some commonsense conservatism to \nthe U.S. Senate. I urge my colleagues to do the same. By supporting a \nsmall business protection bill with a minimum wage increase, we take \none step forward and two giant steps back. We owe it to the American \npeople to keep their dreams of a brighter future alive.\n\n\n                              section 936\n\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, last year, the Senate voted to terminate \nsection 936 and provide for a 10-year grandfather period, with various \nrestrictions, for existing companies doing business in Puerto Rico. \nMany of us were uncomfortable leaving Puerto Rico without any economic \nincentives to replace section 936 following its termination. I want to \ncommend and thank the distinguished chairman of the Committee on \nFinance for his leadership in reporting out, as part of the Small \nBusiness Job Protection Act of 1996, language that begins to address \nthis serious problem.\n  The provision we are considering today is a step toward encouraging \njob creation for the 4 million American citizens in Puerto Rico by \nputting in place a long-term wage credit for companies currently doing \nbusiness in Puerto Rico. This provision also moves toward the program \nthat we established in 1993. The chairman is to be commended for \nrecognizing the importance of this modification, and I urge the Senate \nto insist on this modification when we go to conference.\n  While this bill provides security for the almost 150,000 employees of \ncompanies currently doing business in Puerto Rico, it does not address \nthe issue of new investment and new jobs under a wage credit program, \nand leaves in question the adequacy of the incentive at the end of 10 \nyears.\n  Mr. ROTH. My distinguished colleague from New York makes some good \npoints, and his views reflect his long standing interest in the \neconomic stability of Puerto Rico. Let me note that I view section 936 \nas an overgenerous tax benefit. However, I recognize that our provision \nfor a continuing wage credit provides significant economic stability \nfor Puerto Rico and enhances job security for these many thousands of \nemployees of U.S. firms. I included the continuing wage credit in the \nFinance Committee bill as a response to the concerns raised by Senator \nMoynihan about Puerto Rico.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I rise today in strong support of the \nbusiness tax provisions in this legislation. In particular, I want to \nspeak about a tax item that I had an opportunity to help include in the \nlegislation. People from my State of Iowa, and other farm States, have \nbeen actively seeking tax relief. This tax bill is a giant step in the \nright direction.\n  In particular, young farmers and all consumers will benefit from the \ninclusion of legislation that we call the Aggie Bond Improvement Act, \nS. 1674. Young farmers will benefit from the improved access to the \nfarming profession. Consumers will benefit from the addition of a new \ngeneration of farmers into the profession that guarantees the flow of \ncheap food into our Nation's supermarkets.\n  Aggie bonds are tax exempt bonds used for first time farmers. I \nintroduced the Aggie Bond Improvement Act with Senators Pressler, \nBaucus, and Moseley-Braun in order to improve the popular first time \nfarmer programs administered by various state authorities. These \nauthorities issue tax exempt bonds to finance loans for first time \nfarmers. With the help of the authorities, these usually younger \nfarmers must secure a participating private lender. This legislation \nprotects the Government's interests because this is a Government and \nprivate sector partnership where the private sector lender assumes all \nof the risk.\n  However, problems exist in the current program, and this legislation \ncorrects some of those problems. The biggest problem is that the \ncurrent first time farmer program does not allow a young farmer to \npurchase the family farm. Because the success of our Nation's farming \nindustry has followed from passing our farmland to succeeding \ngenerations, the current program discriminates against families and \nthereby discourages success.\n  Under current law, a son who is farming with his father, and meets \ncertain eligibility tests, may qualify to use aggie bond financing to \nbuy farmland from a stranger, but not from his father, or even his \ngrandfather. Ironically, the father or grandfather could also use the \naggie bond program to sell farmland to any qualified beginning farmers, \nas long as that farmer is not related to him. Thus, fathers or \ngrandfathers and sons can use aggie bond financing, but not if the \ntransaction involves the sale of the family farm from one generation to \nthe next.\n  This imposes an unfair burden to family farms when compared to \nnonfarm family businesses. In nonfarm family businesses, such as \nmanufacturing or retail businesses, inter-generational sales can use \nall of the tax and purchase benefits that are available in sales \nbetween unrelated parties. Thus, when purchasing the family business, \nchildren of nonfarm business persons compete fairly with the open \nmarket place.\n  However, children of farm families do not have a level playing field \nwhen compared to unrelated buyers. Instead, they have a huge financial \nburden on them. This is easily explained by the fact that they have to \npay a higher rate of interest to get loans to buy the same farmland \nthat unrelated persons can buy.\n  I will add that there is an aging generation of farmers on the land \nthat\n\n[[Page S7447]]\n\nwould like to retire, but cannot because the next generation cannot \nafford the capital to buy the land. In my State of Iowa, and I think in \nmost agricultural States, the average age of our farmers is in their \nupper fifties. In 5 to 6 years we will have 25 percent of our farmers \nwanting to retire. This legislation to improve the State aggie bond \nprograms simply makes the necessary transactions possible. Though it is \nonly a small provision in the greater bill, the aggie bond legislation \nin this Small Business Job Protection Act is extremely important to \nfarm States and consumers alike. Therefore, the tax legislation in the \nSmall Business Job Protection Act earns my resounding support.\n  Mr. President, at this point I ask unanimous consent to have printed \nin the Record after my remarks a letter that I received from a resident \nof Knoxville, IA. Her name is Leslie Miller, and I think that she does \nan outstanding job of quantifying and personalizing the importance of \nthis aggie bond legislation.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                      Iowa State Savings Bank,\n\n                                      Knoxville, IA, July 8, 1996.\n     Hon. Charles Grassley,\n     U.S. Senate, Hart Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Grassley: I am writing to express support for \n     H3448 because it contains provisions originally included in \n     your bill, S1674. The most important of these provisions \n     would expand the use of tax-exempt aggie bonds to include \n     financing the sale of farmland between related parties. These \n     important changes are needed to ease the financial burdens \n     involved with shifting family farming operations from one \n     generation to the next.\n       Iowa State Savings Bank has frequently used aggie bond \n     financing (through Iowa's Beginning Farmer Program) to lower \n     interest costs to beginning farmers. We have found this \n     program successful in helping young farmers acquire the base \n     they need to survive in farming. We have been frustrated that \n     this program has not been available to finance transactions \n     between related parties, particularly sales between parents \n     and children.\n       Under current law, a son who is farming with his father, \n     and meets certain eligibility tests, may qualify to use aggie \n     bond financing to buy farmland from a stranger, but not from \n     his father (or even his grandfather). Ironically, the father \n     (or grandfather) could also use the aggie bond program to \n     sell farmland to any qualified beginner farmer, as long as \n     that farmer is not related to him. Thus, fathers (or \n     grandfathers) and sons can use aggie bond financing, but not \n     if the transaction involves the sale of the family farm from \n     one generation to the next.\n       This inequity imposes an unfair burden to family farm \n     businesses when compared to family businesses that are non-\n     farm in nature. In non-farm family businesses, such as \n     manufacturing or retail businesses, inter-generational sales \n     can use all of the tax and purchase benefits that are \n     available in sales between non-related parties. Thus, \n     children of non-farm businesspersons compete fairly with the \n     open marketplace, when purchasing the family business.\n       However, children of farm families to do not have a ``level \n     playing field'' when compared to non-related buyers. Instead, \n     they have a huge financial burden placed on them that can be \n     best explained by the following examples. These examples use \n     average land values from the 1995 Iowa Land Value Survey, \n     released in December, 1995 by Iowa State University. The \n     values are based on estimates as of November 1, 1995, as \n     compiled by Mike Duffy, an extension economist in Farm \n     Management at ISU.\n       Example 1: Assume that a farmer wants to sell his 270 acre, \n     average-sized, Marion County farm. He prices the farm at \n     $1200 per acre (the county average price) which totals \n     $324,000. He is willing to take 20% down payment and will \n     finance the sale with a 25-year contract. If he sells this \n     farm using the aggie bond program, his interest is tax-\n     exempt, so he could charge about 6.5% interest. If he sells \n     the farm to his son, the interest cannot be tax-exempt, so he \n     will have to charge 9.03% interest (the higher interest is \n     needed for the father to receive the same amount of after-tax \n     money that he would get under the aggie bond program).\n       Under these conditions, the non-related buyer would pay the \n     father a total of $531,426 over the life of the contract. On \n     the other hand, the son would wind up paying $661,583 over \n     the life of the contract. This means the son would pay \n     $130,157 more to buy the farm, than a non-related person \n     would pay. The difference is an extra $5206 per year (or an \n     extra $19.28/acre per year), which places the son at a huge \n     financial disadvantage.\n       (Note: If the father charges his son the same 6.5% interest \n     rate, then he must sell the farm to his son for $1386/acre to \n     get the same after-tax dollars from his 25-year contract.)\n       Example 2: Assume the same size farm, but use the Iowa \n     state average of $1,455/acre. This brings the purchase price \n     to $392,850. Also assume a 20% down payment and a 25-year \n     contract. Under these conditions, a non-related buyer, paying \n     6.5% interest will pay $644,353 over the life of the \n     contract. A son, paying a taxable 9.03% interest, will pay \n     $802,169 over the life of the contract. Thus, the son would \n     pay $157,816 more than a non-related person would pay for the \n     same farm. This is a difference of $6,313, per year (or \n     $23.38/acre per year). Again, the extra dollars make it \n     difficult for the son to survive in farming.\n       We believe that the changes proposed in H3448 will affect \n     15 to 18% of our borrowers. This number can only increase as \n     other children recognize that it may be possible for them to \n     buy their family farm. H3448 can also be of immediate benefit \n     to farmers in poor health, who are reluctant to sell their \n     farm to strangers, but might sell it to a child willing to \n     start farming.\n       We ask that you share the information in this letter with \n     those who would not support the changes proposed in H3448. \n     Thank you, once again, for your diligent work on behalf of \n     beginning farmers and farm families everywhere.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 Leslie S. Miller,\n                                                   Vice President.\n\n\n                  contributions in aid of construction\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, this small business tax bill includes \nlegislation that helps home buyers.\n  The provision is called contributions in aid of construction. It \nrepeals the gross-up tax imposed on families building homes since the \n1986 Tax Act.\n  It will save families and small businesses up to $2,000 off the price \nof a new home or building. The gross-up tax is one where under current \nlaw, regulated public utilities must include in their taxable income \ncontributions from customers, or potential customers. These utility \nservices include water and sewer systems.\n  Customers routinely must finance the cost to the utility of extending \nthe necessary capital improvements to the family home. Therefore, State \nutility commissions require that homes hoping to get utility services \ncontribute to the company both the cost for the capital improvements \nnecessary to extend the service, and the amount of tax that the utility \nwill have to recognize on the receipt of the funds or assets needed for \nthose improvements.\n  This gross-up tax can increase the cost of the contribution in aid of \nconstruction by 70 percent.\n  The cost to families of the present law encourages the proliferation \nof small, uneconomical, and environmentally unsafe water and sewer \nsystems.\n  This legislation is paid for by the water utility industry. \nContributions in aid of construction are so important that the water \nutility industry has volunteered to change the depreciable lives of its \nproperty to finance the law change.\n  Over a 10-year period, this legislation in the chairman's mark raises \nan extra $200 million more than is necessary to pay for the \nlegislation.\n  The contributions in aid of construction legislation is important tax \nrelief for families, and I believe that it is an outstanding addition \nto this legislation.\n\n\n               CHURCH PENSIONS AND PENSION SIMPLIFICATION\n\n  Mr. President, I am pleased that this manager's amendment contains, \nin the pension simplification portion, provisions which will help \nclarify the treatment of church pension plans. The amendment would \nallow combined pension plan coverage for self-employed clergy. It would \nallow pension plans established prior to the enactment of ERISA, which \nis the case for many of the church plans, to use the new definition of \nhighly compensated employees. It authorizes, but does not require, the \nTreasury to design safe harbors from the nondiscrimination rules for \nchurch plans. And it allows for the payroll deduction of pension \ncontributions for clergy on foreign missions. The final bill will also \nretain a change in the tax treatment of parsonage allowances which will \nbenefit many ministers.\n  Mr. President, we included last year in the Finance Committee's \nportions of the Balanced Budget Act legislation which Senator Pryor and \nI introduced early in this Congress designed to deal with many of the \nproblems the church plans were having with the rules pertaining to \nhighly compensated employees and to nondiscrimination. Ultimately, \nthose provisions were dropped from the legislation on the grounds that \nthey did not meet the requirements of the Byrd rule. If the legislation \nwe are considering today is enacted, Mr. President, we will have gone a \nlong way toward taking care of the\n\n[[Page S7448]]\n\nmost serious of the problems faced by the church plans. Of course, much \nwill depend on the Treasury Department's willingness to develop rules \nfor non-discrimination with which the church plans can live. I am \noptimistic that can be done, Mr. President. I believe that, as the \nTreasury Department reviews the situation faced by the church plans \nbecause of the way many of the interested denominations are organized, \nTreasury staff will conclude that it is practically impossible for many \nof the church plans to do the kind of data collection and analysis \nnecessary to demonstrate compliance with the nondiscrimination rules. \nThis is certainly not to say that these plans discriminate; but it is \nto say that Treasury should help work out a method to insure that such \nplans can more easily demonstrate that they do not.\n  I will conclude with just a word about the main pension \nsimplification provisions in the bill, Mr. President. And that is to \nsay that these simplification represent a major step forward. Their \nenactment should ultimately result in more pension plans being created, \nparticularly by smaller businesses. Since it is that segment of the \nbusiness community that has the greatest difficulty in offering \npensions to their employees, enactment of these provisions should \nresult in a major increase in pension coverage. Ultimately, that means \nmore savings and more income for retirees. These simplification \nprovisions have been on our congressional agenda for several years. It \nis high time they were enacted.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, the Senate is today considering a \nlegislative proposal to increase the federal minimum wage, which \ncurrently stands at $4.25 per hour. Few actions taken by this body can \neffectuate more immediate and discernable effects on our nation's low-\nwage earners than increasing the minimum wage. Many of these minimum \nwage earners are struggling to make ends meet in today's paradoxical \neconomy, where continued economic growth has been accompanied by rising \neconomic inequality among our nation's citizens. Indeed, we are \nentering a time where President Kennedy's famous saying, ``A rising \ntide lifts all the boats,'' might be made more appropriate if it \nincluded an exception for those diminutive vessels that may be washed \naway and sunk by the indiscriminate waves of economic growth. Consider \na report issued by the U.S. Census Bureau on June 20, 1996, that \nrevealed that income inequality, based on the most commonly used index \nmeasure, increased 22.4 percent from 1968 to 1994, despite considerable \neconomic growth in that same period. For example, in 1994, a household \nwith an income in the 95th percentile earned $109,821, while a \nhousehold with an income in the 20th percentile earned $13,426. The \nformer household earned 8.2 times as much as the latter. In 1968, \nhowever, a household with an income at the 95th percentile earned just \nsix times that of a household at the 20th percentile. Clearly, we have \nseen growing economic disparity in our nation, and there is no \nindication of this perilous trend reversing itself. If we are to combat \nthis nefarious problem, we must first identify its causes. The \naforementioned Census Report presents several reasons for the growing \nincome disparity. Specifically, the report states:\n\n       The wage distribution has become considerably more unequal \n     with more highly skilled, trained, and educated workers at \n     the top experiencing real wage gains and those at the bottom \n     real wage losses. One factor is the shift in employment from \n     those goods-producing industries that have disproportionately \n     provided high-wage opportunities for low-skilled workers, \n     towards services that disproportionately employ college \n     graduates, and towards low-wage sectors such as retail trade. \n     . . . Also cited as factors putting downward pressure on the \n     wages of less-educated workers are intensifying global \n     competition and immigration, the decline of the proportion of \n     workers belonging to unions, the decline in the real value of \n     the minimum wage, the increasing need for computer skills, \n     and the increasing use of temporary workers.\n\n  While, as the report states, there are numerous contributors to \nrising economic inequality, the declining value of the minimum wage \nmust be addressed if we are to seriously combat this insidious trend.\n  Mr. President, as passed by the House of Representatives, H.R. 3448 \nwould increase the statutory minimum wage from its current level of \n$4.25 per hour to $4.75 per hour this year and $5.15 per hour next \nyear. In inflation adjusted terms, the proposal would restore the \nminimum wage to roughly the same level it had after the most recent \n1991 increase went into effect. If no action were taken this year with \nrespect to the minimum wage, it would continue approaching a 40-year \nlow in real buying power by 1997. Included in the House-passed minimum \nwage increase is an exemption for employees under 20 years of age who \nare in their first 90 days of service to an employer--the so-called \n``Opportunity'' Wage. A similar, albeit temporary, provision was \nincluded in the last minimum wage increase in 1989, and, despite the \nfact that the Department of Labor found that few employers actually \nused this ``training'' wage, it is being reestablished on a permanent \nlevel in the bill before us today. While I question the logic of \nrehashing this failed experiment, I nevertheless intend to support the \nbill as it currently stands. It will restore the minimum wage to a \nreasonable level by making work pay for a substantial number of our \nlowest-wage earners.\n\n  Mr. President, it should be noted that the value of the minimum wage \nin real, or inflation adjusted, dollars peaked in 1968 and has since \nfallen gradually to less than 60-percent of that value. According to a \nreport by the Congressional Research Service, the value of the minimum \nwage today would have to be $7.13 per hour to be worth as much as it \nwas in 1968. Mr. President, the proposal before us today would only \nincrease the minimum wage by 90 cents per hour over two years--hardly \nenough to bring it close to its 1968 inflation-adjusted level. Yet, we \nare told by many that this minimum wage increase is unnecessary and \nexcessive. The Republican leadership has cleverly crafted an amendment \nto the House-passed minimum wage increase that would effectively deny \neven this modest minimum wage increase to a substantial number of \ndeserving workers. The Republican amendment to H.R. 3448 would not only \ndelay the increase until next year, but it would also extend the \n``Opportunity'' wage to 180 days of service for all employees, not just \nto those under the age of 20. In addition, the Republican amendment \nwould exempt all businesses with less than $500,000 in annual sales \nfrom the minimum wage increase. The Department of Labor estimates that \nthis provision alone would deny the minimum wage increase to 10.5 \nmillion workers. In my own state, West Virginia, this small business \nexemption would exclude nearly 67,000 workers from coverage under the \nnew minimum wage increase. Clearly, this amendment represents an \nattempt to eviscerate the minimum wage increase entirely. If we are to \napprove a real increase in the minimum wage, we must defeat this \ntendentious amendment.\n  Mr. President, allow me to reiterate that we are engaged in a \nfundamental debate about fairness. We are considering a proposal to \nincrease the federal minimum wage from $4.25 per hour by just 90 cents \nto $5.15 per hour. In my own state of West Virginia, this increase in \nthe minimum wage would affect nearly 100,000 workers--about 23 percent \nof West Virginia's estimated 425,000 employed wage and salary workers. \nAccording to the U.S. Department of Labor, in 1995, the percentage of \nWest Virginians paid wages at or below the $4.25 minimum wage was 10.2 \npercent, which was the highest in the nation and nearly twice the \nnational average of 5.3 percent. The pending minimum wage increase \nwould give a raise of up to $1,800 a year to these workers that could \nbe used to pay for seven months of groceries, nine months of utility \nbills, or four months of housing costs. In addition, many of these low-\nwage earners are women who represent their families sole source of \nincome. According to the 1990 Census, more than 80 percent of single \nparent families in West Virginia were headed by women. In short, the \npending minimum wage increase would help lift many low-income families \nabove the poverty line--not with work-deterring welfare checks, but \nwith higher wages for hours worked.\n\n  Mr. President, in conclusion, I would like to reemphasize my support \nfor the modest minimum wage increase that is before us today. It is a \nproposal that will affect the lives of many of our most needy citizens. \nIt is not akin to\n\n[[Page S7449]]\n\nhanding out welfare checks; the minimum wage only applies to those who \nwork. Moreover, in the context of welfare reform, it is essential that \nwe create incentives for current recipients to work and earn a decent \nliving. The current minimum wage earner who works 40 hours a week earns \njust $170 a week, or about $680 a month. Every Member of this body \nearns nearly that much in one day. So, I hope that all Senators will \nview the minimum wage increase in the context of fairness, and not \npartisanship. In addition, I ask that all Senators consider the growing \nincome inequality that I have already discussed. We are slowly becoming \na nation of haves and have-nots--we are losing those in the middle. \nThis trend does not augur well for the future of our Nation. Aristotle \nadmonished mankind more than 2000 years ago about how important it is \nto maintain a healthy, sizable middle class, or what he described as \nthe ``middle people.'' He writes in ``Politics'':\n\n       It is the middle citizens in a state who are the most \n     secure: they neither covet, like the poor, the possessions of \n     others, nor do others covet theirs as the poor covet those of \n     the rich. . . . It is clear . . . that the best partnership \n     in a state is the one which operates through the middle \n     people, and also that those states in which the middle \n     element is large, and stronger if possible that the other two \n     altogether, or at any rate stronger than either of them \n     alone, have every chance of having a well-run constitution.\n\n  We must remember Aristotle's insightful words. While the minimum wage \nwill not instantly lift any poor, low-wage earner to the middle class, \nit will provide a more accessible ladder for those who, although they \nmay lack certain skills, have the energy and determination to fulfill \ntheir own American dream. Let us give them that chance.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Today we get the opportunity to assure that 12 million \nAmerican workers are provided with a much needed and much deserved \nraise. The value of the minimum wage is 50 cents less than it was when \nit was last increased and it's headed for a 40-year low. At last we \nhave the chance to increase the minimum wage so that American families \naren't working harder for less.\n  Some say that working Americans don't deserve a raise. I say look at \nthe facts. In my home State of Iowa our minimum wage is 40 cents above \nthe national law. The increase has meant more money in the pockets of \nIowa workers and more money spent in our local economy. Jobs are up, \nunemployment is down, and our economy is stronger.\n  Look around the Nation. Two-thirds of minimum wage workers are \nadults. Nearly 60 percent are women. More than one-third are the sole \nbreadwinners.\n  Now think about this. Last year, the CEO's in America's top companies \nmade an average of over $4.3 million--about $12,000 a day. Meanwhile \nsomeone working for minimum wage made $8,500 a year. That means that a \ntop CEO made more in 1 day than a minimum wage worker earns in well \nover a year. That's not right and it's not good for America.\n  The one thing spoiling this vote today is an amendment offered by the \nmajority. They delayed this vote for as long as they could and they're \nstill trying to stack the deck against working Americans. The Bond \namendment is even more extreme than the Goodling amendment that was \nrejected as too extreme by House Republicans. Through a host of \nexemptions, denials, and delays, the Republican minimum wage proposal \nis designed to provide the minimum possible minimum wage increase to \nthe minimum number of people.\n  First, the Bond amendment delays the increase until January 1, 1997--\nthat means that for another 6 months, minimum wage workers will go \nwithout a raise, as they already have for more than 5 years. This works \nout to about $500 in pay that employees would receive over the next 6 \nmonths, money that could be spent on crucial family needs like health \ncare, food, and housing.\n  Next, they want to create a subminimum wage for all workers. Their \nproposal would allow employers to pay all new employees a subminimum \nwage of $4.25 an hour, for 6 months. That means that no matter how old \nyou are and how much experience you have, if you start a new job, your \nvalue to your employer is equal to the most inexperienced employee. \nThat's far worse than the opportunity wage passed by the House that \naffected young workers age 20 and under for 90 days.\n  And last, the Bond amendment would exempt 10.5 million workers--two-\nthirds of all companies--from a minimum wage coverage by providing for \nan across-the-board exemption for small businesses with less than \n$500,000 annual sales. This is unnecessary. The economy has added more \nthan 10 million jobs since the last minimum wage increase and small \nbusiness has led the way.\n  The Bond amendment is a blatant attempt to derail the opportunity to \ngive America a raise. The National Retail Association admitted as much \nin one of their action alerts to members. Referring to the Bond \namendment the alert advised members that, ``It is our last chance and \nbest hope for stopping the minimum wage increase this year.''\n  The majority is trying to two-step with the working Americans. They \nsay for every step forward, working Americans have to take two steps \nback. Well, we don't do that dance and I urge my colleagues to reject \nthe Bond amendment.\n  The bottom line: America deserves a raise. Profits and productivity \nare up. There is room to give workers a wage they deserve without \nharming economic growth. The rest of the economy shouldn't be doing \nbetter than the people who make it run.\n  So I urge my colleagues to support a raise in the minimum wage. It is \nthe right thing to do and it is overdue.\n  Mr. President, I also want to make brief remarks on the tax \nprovisions in the bill.\n  I am a strong supporter of the pension improvements: increasing the \nability of small businesses to establish pension plans with far less \npaperwork. Too many smaller businesses do not have pension plans. And, \nthis legislation will help in that area. We need to do more to increase \nthe availability of pensions and to secure further protections against \ninappropriate actions that reduce pension benefits.\n  The higher expensing limits allowing more capital purchases to be \ndeducted will be helpful to many small businesses.\n  The extension and modifications in the targeted jobs tax credit, now \ncalled the work opportunity tax credit and the extension of the \nexclusion of employer paid higher education costs are an excellent step \ntoward increasing the ability of Americans to improve their education \nand job skills. We need to help people get their first leg up the \nladder of success and we need to improve the skills of workers. The \nmeasure also extends the R tax credit which I have long supported.\n  I am also pleased that the Senate once again passed provisions to \nblock billionaires from gaining tax advantages from renouncing their \ncitizenship. This is long overdue reform.\n  So, while I believe certain provisions can and should be improved in \nthis bill, overall it is a victory for American workers and will \nprovide needed help to small businesses. I hope conferees are named \npromptly and a strong bill is quickly sent to the President in a form \nhe will sign.\n\n\n                     minimum wage and nursing homes\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I would like to ask the bill's proponents \nabout one serious ramification of a minimum wage increase, that is, the \neffect this increase will have on the Medicaid Program. Almost one-half \nof Medicaid dollars are spent in long-term care, primarily for the \nelderly. It stands to reason that an increase in the minimum wage will \naffect all health care providers, including those who are providing \ncare under Medicaid.\n  Nursing homes are large employers of minimum wage workers. They \nemploy significant numbers of nurse aids, orderlies, food service, and \nhousekeeping staff who all contribute to the care of nursing home \npatients. Labor costs account for about 60 percent of all nursing home \ncosts.\n  However, unlike other businesses, the nursing home industry is unable \nto reduce its staff. The level of care that is required both by \ninternal quality standards and by Federal regulations means that \nnursing home staff, particularly those individuals who are directly \nproviding patient care, cannot be reduced.\n  In short, nursing homes are caught in a catch-22. They cannot adjust \nthe size\n\n[[Page S7450]]\n\nor configuration of their staffs; so they suffer a significant increase \nin labor costs. Yet, unless the minimum wage increase is taken into \naccount in determining Medicaid reimbursement rates, nursing homes \ncannot recover any of the increase.\n  So, unlike any other business, which can either reduce its number of \nworkers or pass the increased costs on to consumers, nursing homes are \nsimply left to absorb it. I am very concerned that this will have a \nserious adverse impact on our nursing homes both in the short- and \nlong-run. In our country, we need to be able to depend on these \nfacilities to provide quality care for our frail elderly and infirm \npopulation.\n  Does the Senator from Massachusetts agree with me that the Fair Labor \nStandards Act should be a factor in determining nursing home \nreimbursements under Medicaid?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Yes, I do. Major nursing home reform passed Congress in \n1987 as part of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act [OBRA], Public \nLaw 100-203. This act required significant changes in staffing and \ntraining requirements, quality of care, patient services, and \nenforcement of new nursing home standards. Because Congress was \nconcerned about the ability of the nursing home industry to absorb \ncosts of this magnitude, special language was included to ensure that \nthe Medicaid reimbursement systems of the States were altered to cover \nthese costs. Just as care was taken to ensure that the Medicaid \nreimbursement system adequately accommodated the OBRA 1987 cost \nincreases, I believe it is fair to do so in conjunction with a new \nminimum wage law. The increase in the minimum wage should be taken into \naccount in plans submitted by States to HCFA. The Federal nursing home \nquality standards have been enormously successful in improving the \nquality of care and quality of life of our nursing home residents and \nwe do not want to do anything to diminish the successes we are \nachieving as a result of those reforms.\n  We are all well aware that States now are setting Medicaid rates, not \non the basis of costs incurred by facilities in providing long-term \ncare services, but rather on State budgetary constraints. A recent \nsurvey of nursing homes nationwide indicates that in half the States, a \nmajority of facilities do not receive Medicaid rates that cover the \nactual cost of providing care to their Medicaid patients. This \nsituation will only worsen if States are not held accountable for \nrecognizing increased labor costs that facilities will incur under this \nnew minimum wage law.\n  Mr. HATCH. I think we agree that any increases in the minimum wage \nshould be a factor in Medicaid reimbursements. I thank my colleague for \nthis clarification.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I wanted to lend my support to the \ncolloquy between my colleagues Senators Hatch and Kennedy relative to \nnursing homes and the minimum wage. In their colloquy my colleagues \nnote that nursing homes, many of which, particularly in rural areas \nlike my State of Iowa, are funded primarily through the Medicare and \nMedicaid programs. Nursing homes provide vital services to our elderly \nand disabled citizens and they employ many minimum wage workers who \nprovide direct care to these residents. Therefore, this minimum wage \nincrease, which will help these valued workers and help increase their \nretention, will have an impact on nursing homes costs. And that should \nbe reflected in Medicare and Medicaid payments. It is essential that \nstate Medicaid payments be reasonable and adequate to enable well-run \nfacilities to meet and exceed the quality standards set by law.\n  I thank my colleagues for raising this important issue and I \nappreciate the opportunity to express my agreement with their \nstatements.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, finally, the issue of raising the \nminimum wage has come to the floor for a vote. It has been disturbing \nduring these many months that the Republican leadership has employed \nextraordinary legislative tactics, some quite complicated and \nperplexing even for our parliamentarians, to keep the Members of this \nChamber from voting on this issue.\n  In the State of New Mexico, which I represent, more than 10 percent \nof the work force, approximately 80,000 workers, would receive a wage \nincrease if this legislation is passed. Let me put in stark perspective \nwhat we are talking about.\n  Minimum wage levels today are approaching their lowest levels in \nhistory. Despite having raised the minimum wage 17 times since 1938, \neach time with bipartisan support, the minimum wage will hit its lowest \nlevel in real dollars in January 1997. Two-thirds of those earning the \nminimum wage today--and working full time--are adults, and 40 percent \nof those earning minimum wage are the sole breadwinners for their \nfamilies. For working hard, trying to stay in the mainstream of those \nwanting to get ahead in this economy, these workers make just $8,840 a \nyear. And usually, they don't have health coverage. They don't have \ngain-sharing. They aren't covered by pension benefits. And their \ntraining resources are usually very limited, if not non-existent.\n  This is a subject that we should have been allowed to vote on long \nago. Americans need to know that we support those who want to work to \nget ahead. A family of four earning less than $16,039 is classified as \none in poverty. And yet, we have a substantial portion of America's \nwork force earning $8,840 a year--well under the poverty level. \nFurthermore, I think that we must recognize that women represent 60 \npercent of the work force earning minimum wage, and that occupations \nwith the highest percentage of minimum wage workers are women. This is \nnot acceptable.\n  Earlier this year, I issued a report entitled ``Scrambling To Pay the \nBills: Building Allies for America's Working Families.'' In that \nreport, I endorsed an increase in the minimum wage--which I strongly \nsupport today. However, we tried to do some other things in that report \nas well. One of these was to address the huge disparity between what \nthe CEO of a firm made in salary compared to the lowest-paid employee \nof that respective firm. Numerous objections came from the business \ncommunity that we were attempting to set up a ratio that did not \nreflect a reasonable ratio between the highest and lowest paid workers \nfor a company. When we wrote this, I mistakenly assumed that the lowest \npaid employee was probably earning somewhere about $15,000 a year--and \n50 times that figure would allow the CEO to earn $750,000 a year, in \norder to receive some tax advantages we were proposing. That same week, \nthe Washington Post reported that CEO's of America's top 100 firms \nearned an average salary over $4 million.\n\n  I was wrong on two fronts. The lowest paid are earning less than \n$9,000 a year and the highest paid salaries are somewhere between 400 \nand 500 times this figure. I don't think that this ratio reflects a \nfair balance between those who are working hard to help companies and \ncommunities prosper and those who are profiting higher up in the salary \nchain.\n  We must defeat an effort here today sponsored by Senator Bond to \nexempt certain small businesses from paying a higher minimum wage to \ntheir employees. Of the more than 10 million workers who deserve a \nraise, the Bond amendment exempts nearly 5 million--and would have \nundermined the entire rationale for the minimum wage, which establishes \na floor above which all employees can expect a fair and decent return \nfor the work they expend on an employer's behalf. The Bond amendment \nwould encourage employers to favor particular groups of workers over \nothers, particularly younger workers over older ones. This is not \nacceptable and not just.\n  The Bond amendment also creates a 6 month waiting period before the \nincreased minimum wage kicks in. This is nothing more than a way for \nmany employers with high turnover to keep from ever paying the minimum \nwage to those who work in high turnover industries. It is not uncommon \nfor restaurants to experience more than 200-percent staff turnover in 1 \nyear.\n  Workers can't support families--and can hardly support themselves--on \n$4.25 an hour. In the 17 previous times that the minimum wage has been \nraised, there have been naysayers who have predicted dire consequences. \nThe economic trauma that had been predicted by these negative \ncommentators\n\n[[Page S7451]]\n\nhas never occurred, and it is wrong not to include minimum wage workers \nin the gains of an economy that is producing sky-high corporate \nsalaries, historic corporate profits, and all time high stock market \naverages.\n  Mr. President, we can't ignore hard working Americans working on the \nlower end of the economic ladder any longer. I strongly support this \nraise in the minimum wage, and I urge others to do the same.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I want to express my support for \nprovisions in the Small Business Job Protection Act of 1996, that will \nhelp make higher education a reality for thousands of young people in \nAmerica.\n  It is no secret that many families in our Nation are struggling to \nfinance their childrens' education. College tuition costs have \nskyrocketed in the past decade increasing 95 percent at private \ninstitutions and 82 percent at public institutions. Some families will \nspend more than $100,000 just to send one child to college.\n  Mr. President, the financial burdens facing parents with college-age \nchildren is overwhelming. The tendency of some in this Chamber would be \nto create a new Federal program to try to deal with this issue. Yet, \nmany States, including Alabama, have shown that is not necessary by \ndeveloping their own prepaid tuition funds. These funds allow parents \nto make a tax-free investment, years in advance of their child's \nenrollment in college, with the guarantee that the child's full tuition \nwill be paid for by the State when he or she enrolls in college. These \ntuition plans provide parents some help in dealing with the exorbitant \ninflation in tuition costs.\n  The Clinton administration, until very recently, was planning on \ntaxing these State funds and the parents who invest in these plans. \nAfter months of encouragement, we have been successful in getting the \nadministration to temporarily back off from taxing these funds and the \nworking class families who invest in them. At the same time the \nPresident was cheering the benefits of lowering the cost of education \nthrough his new education tax credit, his administration was preparing \nto slap a new tax on families.\n  Mr. President, this bill ensures that these funds will not be taxed, \nand it provides that parents will not have to pay taxes on the money \nthey invest in these funds. These are two very positive steps, but I \nbelieve we should go further. Congress should ensure that students are \nnot forced to pay taxes on their education when they enroll in college. \nCurrently, the student is taxed on the difference between the value of \nthe education services they receive from the State and the amount his \nor her parent paid for the prepaid tuition contract.\n  Mr. President, the correct way to view these prepaid tuition \narrangements should be as a prepayment of services, not an investment \nscheme to make money. When parents enter into these contracts with the \nStates, they are trying to buy their child's future education at an \naffordable price. Neither they nor their children are trying to get \nrich. Therefore, I don't believe the Federal Government should saddle \nstudents with taxes on their college expenses. Students today are \nalready facing a lifetime of enormous taxes to pay off the debts of \nprevious generations. Now, the IRS would have these same people pay \ntaxes on a service their parents purchased for them long before they \nenrolled in college.\n  Unfortunately, because of the minimum wage issue, we were unable to \noffer amendments to this legislation. Had we been permitted, I would \nhave offered an amendment to ensure that students would not be taxed on \ntheir college expenses. I am a cosponsor of Senator McConnell's bill \nwhich would accomplish that, and I applaud him for his efforts in this \narea. I will continue to do everything I possibly can to find ways to \nmake education in America more affordable. The bill before us today is \na significant step in that direction, and I look forward to working \nwith Chairman Roth and others in the future to provide even more \nfavorable tax treatment for families.\n  Mr. BRYAN. Mr. President, the difficulty in bringing the issues we \nare voting on today before the Senate has resulted in an unfortunate \nparliamentary situation, where the bill is not open to amendments. \nWhile I generally support the bill, and plan to vote in favor of the \nbill today, I would have preferred the bill to be open to amendment, \nboth to add other desirable provisions, particularly to the small \nbusiness tax relief title, and to offer amendments to strike provisions \nwhich I believe are inappropriate.\n  In particular, there is one provision which I am strongly opposed to: \nthe provision which imposes income tax withholding on winnings from \nkeno and bingo. Under current law, income taxes are withheld only for \nwinnings where the odds are over 300 to 1, but bingo and keno are \nexempt. The bill being considered by the Senate today extends this \nwithholding to bingo and keno winnings over $5,000, regardless of the \nodds of the wager.\n  The change in withholding included in the bill is not included for \nany serious policy or enforcement reason. In fact, there is good reason \nnot to require withholding on gambling winnings. For example, gambling \nwinnings can be offset by gambling losses--drastically reducing the \nactual tax due from the winnings. Since withholding is intended to \napproximate actual tax liability, requiring withholding for a tax \nliability that does not exist runs counter to sound tax policy.\n  Of course, requiring withholding on bingo and keno winnings was not \nincluded in this bill for tax policy or enforcement reasons--it was \nsolely in order to raise revenue for other tax provisions of the bill. \nWhile I am supportive of these tax cuts, I object to offsetting them \nwith a provision that will negatively impact only one segment of the \neconomy, the gaming-entertainment industry.\n  Tax withholding on bingo and keno winnings is unsound for policy \nreasons and unfair to an important industry in my State. This \nprovision, and similar provisions proposed or adopted in recent years, \ncontinue to show a disregard and lack of knowledge concerning the \ngaming/entertainment industry in Congress and at the IRS. The revenue \nraised by this provision is relatively small--$69 million over 10 \nyears--but could cause significant harm in a legitimate industry.\n  I will vote for this bill in spite of my opposition to increasing \nwithholding on gambling winnings, but I urge the conference committee \nto drop this misguided attempt to raise revenue.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I support the tax provisions included in \nH.R. 3448, the bill now before us. These provisions are important, not \nonly to small businesses, but to almost every American business. And, I \nam one who believes, Mr. President, that simplifying and lessening the \ntax burden faced by American entrepreneurs--both small and large--will \nhave substantial benefits for workers as well. Unfortunately, the \ndetriments of the minimum wage increase, which is also included in this \nbill, outweigh the benefits of the tax provisions in this bill.\n  Mr. President, H.R. 3448 has much to recommend it. For example, I am \npleased to see that the bill increases the amount of newly purchased \nequipment that a small business can expense from the current $17,500 to \n$25,000. This change will make it easier for these enterprises to \nafford to invest in new equipment. This will help not only small \nbusinesses but also those larger companies that supply equipment to \nthem and will thus have a multiplier effect on the economy. Moreover, \nincreasing the expensing allowance will decrease the recordkeeping \nburden these companies face.\n  This bill also goes a long way toward reforming the tax treatment of \nS corporations. My colleague and friend from Arkansas, Senator Pryor, \nand I have long been advocating the need for S corporation reform. \nWhile this bill does not contain all of the reform measures that we \nintroduced in our S. 758, the S Corporation Reform Act, it certainly is \na very good step in the right direction.\n  Many of my colleagues may not realize it, Mr. President, but there \nare nearly 2 million S corporations in the United States, most of them \nsmall businesses. These reform provisions are designed to ease their \ntax compliance burden and to increase these companies' access to \ncapital.\n  Another very good set of provisions included in this bill is that \ndealing with pension simplification. All of us\n\n[[Page S7452]]\n\nare aware, I think, of the special problems that small businesses face \nin providing pension benefits to their employees. It is no accident \nthat fewer than 20 percent of the employees of small businesses are \ncovered by a pension plan. The problem is twofold, Mr. President.\n  First, many small businesses are afraid to commit to providing a \ncertain percentage of their payroll every year to funding a pension or \nprofit sharing plan. It's not that these businesses are stingy with \ntheir employees. Rather, many of them are operating on such thin cash \nflow margins that they are hesitant to add to their overhead and \npossibly overcommit their already strained resources.\n  The second problem is probably even more widespread among small \nenterprises. This problem is that setting up and administering a \npension plan is a very costly undertaking. Let's face it, Mr. \nPresident. Most small businesses in America are already struggling to \nkeep up with the myriad rules and regulations that are piled on them by \nFederal, State, and local governments. The last thing they need is to \nhave to learn and comply with the mind-numbing regulations governing \npension plans contained in the Internal Revenue Code. Even hardened tax \nveterans admit that these rules are almost beyond comprehension for \nthem. How is a small business man or woman supposed to master them? The \nalternative is paying big dollars for a specialist to administer the \nplan, again stretching the small firm's tight resources.\n  This bill deals with both of these problems by providing for a new \ntype of pension plan that allows small employers to sponsor pension \nplans with low employer contributions. It gives the business the \nflexibility to contribute a higher percentage of employee compensation \nin good years or to contribute as low as 1 percent in difficult years. \nAt the same time, however, employees are given the benefits of tax \nfavored treatment on both their own contributions and those of the \nemployer.\n  Moreover, Mr. President, H.R. 3448 simplifies the onerous compliance \nburden that now accompanies pension plan sponsorship. These rules are \ndesigned to take away the worst of the compliance headaches that are \nnow keeping many businesses from offering pension plans to their \nemployees. All in all, the pension reform provisions in this bill \nshould go a long way toward increasing the retirement security of the \nmillions of Americans who work for small businesses.\n  Let me mention one other very important section of the tax bill now \nbefore the Senate. This bill temporarily extends a number of tax \nprovisions that Congress has allowed to expire. These include the \nresearch and experimentation credit, the work opportunity tax credit, \nthe orphan drug tax credit, and the tax credit for producing fuel from \na nonconventional source. It is important to note, Mr. President, that \nthese so-called extenders are important for small, medium, and large \nbusinesses alike. There are thousands of businesses in my home State of \nUtah, and millions across the Nation, that will find the extension of \nthese provisions important in helping them to grow and create jobs in \nthe future.\n  But, as much as I like the tax title of this bill, Mr. President, I \nhave to say that it is far from perfect. Let me just briefly outline \nwhat I see as its greatest deficiencies.\n  As my colleagues know, the only reason we are voting on a tax bill \ntoday is because of the increase in the minimum wage that is also \nincluded in H.R. 3448. I believe strongly that mandatory increases in \nlabor costs create any number of problems for both small businesses and \nworkers. I will discuss those in a moment.\n  The House of Representatives recognized the added burden placed on \nsmall businesses in particular and attached the small business tax \nprovisions to the minimum wage bill in order to help alleviate some of \nthe harsh results that the minimum wage increase will have on small \nenterprises.\n  One harsh result that will come from a 21-percent increase in the \nminimum wage is the loss of jobs. According to CBO, it is estimated \nthat increasing the minimum wage will mean that as many as 500,000 jobs \nwill either be lost or not created.\n  Yet, as beneficial as these tax provisions are, and they will have an \nindirect benefit to job creation, they are not designed to be big job \ngenerators. I would have liked to see provisions that would have at \nleast offset the job losses that will result from the minimum wage \nhike.\n  The best thing we could include in a bill designed to overcome the \ndisemployment effect of the minimum wage increase is a cut in the \ncapital gains tax rate. Such a change would unleash a significant \nportion of the estimated $8 trillion in unrealized capital gains that \nis out there in our economy. If we could free up only 10 percent of \nthis mountain of capital--or $800 billion--the job creation that would \nresult would overshadow the loss of jobs that will result from \nincreasing the minimum wage.\n  Don't get me wrong, Mr. President. The tax measures in this bill are \npositive provisions that will assist small businesses. They don't, \nhowever, have the job creation power that a capital gains tax cut has. \nSo, if the Senate were really serious about helping workers or those \nwho cannot find a job, we would concentrate our efforts on improving \nopportunities for those who may be unemployed or underemployed. The \nbest way to do this is by expanding the availability of capital needed \nto create these opportunities.\n  I am also concerned about the way that this bill extends the expired \ntax provisions. Ideally, Congress should find a way to make these \nprovisions permanent. The continual expiration and reinstatement of \nthese provisions leads to taxpayer skepticism about our tax laws and \ngreatly reduces the effectiveness of the provisions. This is \nparticularly true of the research and experimentation credit. The bill \nbefore us today does include an extension of the research credit, but \nonly on a prospective basis from July 1, 1996. Therefore, the bill \nleaves a year-long gap, from July 1, 1995 to June 30, 1996, in which \nthe research credit is not in effect.\n  The research credit has been a part of the Internal Revenue Code \nsince 1981, but only as a temporary measure. It has been allowed to \nexpire seven times, counting the most recent expiration on June 30, \n1995. Each of the times that the bill expired before this last \nexpiration, Congress has extended the bill on a retroactive basis. \nThus, even though Congress often did not act until after the research \ncredit had expired, it has always, until this bill, gone back and made \nthe credit effective from the date of expiration.\n  The seamless extension of the research credit is important because \nthe businesses that have counted on the credit as an incentive to \nincrease their research activities will now find that the credit is not \navailable for an entire year. Many of these companies based their \nresearch plans on the availability of the credit. Why shouldn't they \ncount on it being there? After all, Congress had never left a gap in \nits extensions of the credit before. The bill before us, however, \nbreaks this faith and sets a very poor precedent. This gap, along with \nthe temporary nature of the credit, will greatly reduce the \neffectiveness of this credit, Mr. President. I hope that this problem \ncan be corrected in conference.\n  Finally, Mr. President, let me briefly mention another flaw of this \nbill. In the name of closing a perceived corporate tax loophole, H.R. \n3448 dramatically reduces the benefits available to companies doing \nbusiness in Puerto Rico under section 936 of the Internal Revenue Code. \nWe could debate the merits and perceived abuses of section 936 all day. \nI simply want to point out to my colleagues that the focus of attention \non this issue has been far too concentrated on a few companies that \nhave reportedly reaped rich benefits from the section 936 credit, and \nfar too little on the people of Puerto Rico, who have been able to pull \nthemselves out of dire economic circumstances over the past few \ndecades, largely as a result of the credit.\n  I believe that Congress is being shortsighted in gutting section 936, \nMr. President. Without the jobs that section 936 companies bring to the \nisland of Puerto Rico, many U.S. citizens will find themselves in \neconomic difficulties. Congress will likely spend more money in \nincreased transfer payments through higher welfare benefits and \nunemployment benefits than will be saved through the tax changes \nincluded in this bill. At a minimum, we should\n\n[[Page S7453]]\n\nensure that Puerto Rico has a permanent incentive to attract new jobs \nto the commonwealth.\n  So, Mr. President, I am disappointed in the overall small business \ntax package. I favor its provisions, but I believe they should be \nstronger. The potential positive impact could be so much greater.\n  My views on increasing the minimum wage are well known. I have long \nbelieved that raising the statutory minimum wage merely raises the \nrungs on the ladder of opportunity.\n  I am also well aware of the opinion polls that show that a \nsubstantial majority of the American people believe that a raise in the \nminimum wage is a good idea.\n  Many believe that this is a quick, painless way to help the \ndisadvantaged in our society; many believe that a minimum wage hike is \ncostless; and many believe that it has no adverse impact. I can only \nsuggest that the people have not been given all the facts about this \nproposal.\n  I wonder, for example, if the people realize that even the most \noptimistic estimate puts job loss at 100,000 entry level jobs. The \nCongressional Budget Office estimates the loss of 100,000 to 500,000 \njobs given a 21 percent increase in the minimum wage. Other estimates \nare higher.\n  While there are always dissenters, there are few public policy issues \non which there is such an overwhelming consensus among economists. \nThree-quarters of the members of the American Economic Association \nagree that minimum wage hikes have a disemployment effect that stifles \nemployment opportunities for low-skilled workers.\n  This position is summed up by William Baumol and Alan Blinder, who \nwas a Clinton appointee to the Federal Reserve Board: ``The primary \nconsequence of the minimum wage law is not an increase in the incomes \nof the least skilled workers, but a restriction on their employment \nopportunities.''\n  The long and the short of it is simply that you cannot mandate an \nincrease in the price of entry level or unskilled labor--which is \nexactly what the statutory minimum wage is--without reducing the demand \nfor that labor.\n  It is true that some workers will reap the benefit of the increase. \nBut, by mandating wage increases we are going to destroy job \nopportunities for many others.\n  Let me put it another way: Some workers will get a $36 a week raise. \nPotentially half a million workers won't have a job at all. I hope my \ncolleagues do not break their arms patting themselves on the back for \nsuch benevolence.\n  Now, let us look at the demographics of who would be helped and who \nwould be hurt by the loss of job opportunities.\n  There are more adult minimum wage earners in families earning $30,000 \nper year than in families earning less than $10,000 per year. Forty \npercent of all minimum wage earners are teenagers and young adults \nliving at home. They are not heads of household.\n  A majority of minimum wage earners live in families in which they are \nnot the principal breadwinner. Only about a quarter of all minimum wage \nearners are heads of household.\n  The fact is that there is no way to target the benefit--to the extent \nthere is one--only to those who are heads of households or working \npoor.\n  The reality is that those who are not poor are more likely to get \nraises and those whose skills do not justify the higher wage will be \nout of jobs. Study after study has concluded that raising the minimum \nwage is an ineffective means of helping those who are disadvantaged.\n  Kevin Lang, professor of economics at Boston University, has stated \nthat ``Low-skilled adults in states that raised their minimum wage were \noften crowded out of the job market by teens and students.''\n  Peter Brandon, of the Institute for Research on Poverty at the \nUniversity of Wisconsin has found that ``welfare mothers in states that \nraised their minimum wage remained on public assistance 44 percent \nlonger than their peers in states where the minimum wage remained \nunchanged.''\n  If there was ever an issue for which the benefits were swamped by the \ndownsides, this is it. And, those who we intend to help are exactly \nthose who are most likely to be hurt.\n  Yes, Mr. President, raising the minimum wage sounds like an easy way \nto help those who are working but still struggling to find their way \nout of poverty. It is no wonder that, lacking the facts, the American \npeople would support this.\n  Frankly, if I thought it would do what my friend Senator Kennedy says \nit will do, I would support it myself. If I believed we could improve \nthe standard of living for all Americans by governmental fiat, I would \nbe joining the Senator from Massachusetts on the other side of the \naisle. Who would not want to stamp out poverty with the stroke of a \npen?\n  But, things just do not work that way. It is not that easy.\n  The idea that there is no adverse impact from a mandatory increase in \nthe cost of hiring workers is delusional.\n  And, what's worse, this adverse impact is for nothing.\n  This legislation will not be the economic salvation of minimum wage \nearners. Even for a minimum wage worker lucky enough to benefit from \nit, it will provide a $36 a week raise.\n  It will take about $7.10 an hour to produce an income equal to the \npoverty level for a family of four. But, proponents will not suggest \nraising the wage to that level. Why? Because they know the \nconsequences.\n  This proposal to increase the minimum wage, like the emperor who has \nno clothes, is spurious. And, someone has to tell the truth. The \nAmerican people deserve to know all the facts about this minimum wage \nhike.\n  We have a lot of work to do yet during this Congress. It is \ndisappointing that my colleagues on the other side of the aisle have \nbecome Johnny one-notes with respect to the minimum wage and have \noffered it to virtually every bill we have debated since mid-March.\n  Is this the only idea they have to offer? It would certainly seem so.\n  Let us get down to business on some proposals that will help working \nmen and women--like tax cuts, a balanced budget, regulatory reform. Let \nus get the economy moving. Let us create new jobs and new \nopportunities, not jeopardize the ones we have.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the \nDemocratic proposal to increase the minimum wage.\n  First, let me address the issue of process.\n  It has been clear for months that there is a majority in the Senate \nwho have been prepared to vote for the modest $.90 increase over 2 \nyears which has been proposed. This increase would raise the current \nlevel set in 1989 at $4.25 to $5.15, in two 45 cent steps.\n  Indeed, the majority of our colleagues have already voted to support \nan increase of this size.\n  Yet, rather than allow this issue to be fully debated and voted upon, \nenormous time and energy has been spent on devising ploys to either \nblock such a vote or to load it down with anti-labor poison pills.\n  Mr. President, I'm relieved that this game playing is finally going \nto stop. I'm pleased that we will finally have the opportunity to have \na clean, up or down vote on raising the minimum wage.\n  We ought to raise the minimum wage because it is the fair, just, and \nnecessary thing to do.\n  It has been 5 years since the minimum wage was last adjusted.\n  The minimum wage has been adjusted seven times since the minimum wage \nlaw was first enacted in 1938.\n  Each time, opponents predicted economic disaster would follow any \nincrease. None of those dire predictions came true. The American \neconomy has continued to grow.\n  Since the minimum wage was enacted, every President except Ronald \nReagan signed an increase in the minimum wage into law.\n  Adjusting the minimum wage at regular intervals is a routine task \nthat should never have been turned into a pitched partisan battle.\n  Indeed, Mr. President, it is remarkable that this fierce debate \nshould be taking place in the 104th Congress. This Congress has been \nawash with statements about how we should have work, not welfare. Those \nare views that I, too, share. We should be promoting work, not welfare.\n  But how can we encourage people to leave the welfare rolls and join \nthe\n\n[[Page S7454]]\n\nwork force when we fail to set a minimum hourly wage that provides a \ndecent income?\n  An American worker, working full-time, 40 hours a week, 52 weeks a \nyear, at the current minimum wage would earn less than $9,000 per year.\n  The current poverty level for a family of four is $15,600. Forty \npercent of those earning the minimum wage today are the sole \nbreadwinners for their families.\n  The 90 cent increase being proposed would make a real difference in \nthe lives of these families, and encourage them to stay in the work \nforce.\n  It is estimated, Mr. President, that 12 million American workers--\n200,000 in my own State of Wisconsin--would directly benefit from the \nincrease being proposed in the Democratic amendment.\n  The vast majority--more than two-thirds--are adult workers, not \nteenagers, and they are working to help support their families.\n  Over 101 leading economists, including three recipients of the Nobel \nPrize in Economics, have refuted the argument that increasing the \nminimum wage would hurt the economy. Instead, they have concluded that \nthe modest increase being proposed would have a positive, not a \nnegative, impact upon the labor force and the economy in general.\n  Apparently, Mr. President, many of my colleagues on the other side of \nthe aisle remain unconvinced by the opinions of Nobel laureates. \nAlthough the amendment they are advocating purports to raise the \nminimum wage, it is difficult to imagine a worker who would actually \nhave the opportunity to benefit from it, because it is so loaded down \nwith exceptions.\n  Actually, their amendment seems designed to assure that the status \nquo is maintained. It exempts all employees of small businesses with \ngross annual revenues under $500,000--the very businesses most likely \nto pay their workers the least. These businesses employ 10\\1/2\\ million \npeople and comprise two-thirds of all American workplaces. Not all \nemployees who work in such settings earn the minimum wage, but those \nwho do deserve the same modest raise that others who work for more \nprosperous businesses receive, once this bill is passed and signed by \nthe President.\n  Another outrageous provision in the Republican amendment would create \na permanent second class, subminimum wage. Employers would be allowed \nto pay new workers, regardless of age or experience, $4.25 an hour for \ntheir first 6 months on the job. Although my colleagues on the other \nside of the aisle refer to this lower rate of pay as a ``opportunity \nwage,'' there is no suggestion anywhere in their amendment that workers \nwill receive training in exchange for this discriminatory treatment.\n  This provision would be particularly harmful for migrant and seasonal \nagricultural workers, who rarely work for the same employer for 6 month \nperiods of time. Up to 8,000 migrant workers are employed in my State \nof Wisconsin alone.\n  Finally, adding insult to injury, the Republican amendment wouldn't \neven fully take effect for another year and a half.\n  Mr. President, the workers who benefit from an increase in the \nminimum wage are likely to do something important with the extra \ndollars they receive: Spend them on goods and services for their \nfamilies. That's good for everyone, as these dollars are plowed back \ninto the economy, creating jobs and expanding economic growth.\n  Mr. President, there seems to be a lack of understanding in the minds \nof some about the connection between the economic well-being of the \naverage American worker and economic prosperity for the Nation.\n  Some see the down-sizing of large companies and layoffs of thousands \nof workers across America as an unfortunate, but necessary part of \nincreasing profits for Wall Street investors and attracting the \ninvestments of the multinational conglomerates.\n  They fail to appreciate the fact, however, that if American workers \ndon't have the money to purchase the goods and services, eventually \nboth Wall Street and corporate America will feel the pain as well.\n  The modest increase in the minimum wage being proposed is not a \npanacea for the troubling trends in the relationship between American \nworkers and their employers. There is a growing feeling that the link \nbetween corporate responsibility and the workforce has been frayed \nalmost beyond recognition and that American workers are coming to be \nregarded as disposable goods.\n\n  In his campaign for the Republican Presidential nomination, Pat \nBuchanan tapped into this sense of abandonment of the average American \nworker by corporate America and by international trade agreements like \nGATT and NAFTA that appear to put the profits of large corporations \nahead of the jobs of American laborers.\n  Mr. President, let me stress that this growing separation between \nemployees and their employers is not limited to corporate America or to \nminimum wage job holders.\n  It is not limited to the worker flipping hamburgers at the local \nfast-food shop.\n  It reaches into all levels of the work force, from the mid-level \ncorporate executive to the filing room clerk, who are surviving the \nmergers and downsizing but wonder each night if they will be next.\n  Not a week goes by without a story in some major paper documenting \nthe anxieties of members of the work force, when companies like IBM and \nAT begin casting off thousands of long time employees. Many \ncompanies, still burdened by the debt acquisition of the leveraged buy-\nout frenzy of the 1980's see themselves as having limited options and \nare forced, by economic pressures, to close factories, spinoff \ndivisions, and lay off employees at all levels.\n  Yet, some of the new employment trends cannot be attributed solely to \neconomic pressures.\n  I recently heard of a nonprofit agency, funded almost entirely by \nState and Federal grants which employed some 35 individuals. Yet only \nfive of those people were regular, full-time employees. The rest were \nso-called contract workers--employees in every sense of the word, but \nforced to work without health care, without pension coverage, without \nsick leave, without vacation or other benefits.\n  The Federal Government itself also engages in this practice, hiring \npeople as temporary employees--again without the protections that \nregular workers receive.\n  The vocabulary of the workplace is now filled with new terminology \nlike outsourcing which describes the practice of laying off workers and \nreplacing them with individuals--called either temporary workers, \ncontract workers, or contingent workers--who lack the benefits of \nregular employees and can be treated accordingly, like disposable \nemployees, to be purchased and discarded at will.\n  Mr. President, I have raised issues which I know go beyond the simple \nquestion of whether it is time to increase the minimum wage because I \nthink we need to start thinking about these broader questions.\n  Secretary Reich has spoken out forcefully already about the need to \nre-establish the concept of corporate responsibility to the labor \nforce. I would take that a step further and broaden it to the need to \nrepair the deteriorating bonds between employers and employees in all \nsectors of our society.\n  As we approach the turn of the century, there are troubling signs \nthat we may be moving backward, toward relationships between workers \nand employers that are reminiscent of the 19th century. I seriously \ndoubt anyone wants to see the workplace of the 21st century resemble \nthat of the last century. America left that era behind long ago.\n  A great Nation draws upon the strengths and contributions of all its \npeople. John F. Kennedy said, in 1961, when he asked Congress 35 years \nago to increase the minimum wage, ``Our Nation can ill afford to \ntolerate the growth of an underprivileged and underpaid class. \nSubstandard wages lead necessarily to substandard living conditions, \nhardships and distress.''\n  Let's do our job.\n  Let's vote for an honest increase in the minimum wage.\n  Let's acknowledge that America's prosperity rests upon the well-being \nof its people, its work force, and their families.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, it is regrettable that the bill that comes \nbefore us\n\n[[Page S7455]]\n\ntoday combines two unrelated and very different issues--tax relief with \nan increase in the minimum wage.\n  I presume that the two issues were coupled in an effort to mitigate \nthe adverse effect that the minimum wage increase would have on small \nbusinesses. It would not, however, mitigate the adverse effect on those \nindividuals who will be unable to find jobs, or who will lose their \njobs, on account of the increased wage that the Federal Government will \nhave mandated.\n  The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimates that the proposed 21-\npercent increase in the minimum wage to $5.15 would create job losses \nof between 100,000 to 500,000. In addition, CBO has said that the \ncreation of thousands of jobs could be inhibited if the minimum wage is \nincreased.\n  I have heard from numerous constituents who are opposed to an \nincrease in the minimum wage. One motel management owner in Arizona \nwrote me to say that the tax repeal provisions of the bill are not \nenough to offset the negative ramifications of an increase in the \nminimum wage. Another constituent, the owner of a fast-food restaurant \nin Arizona, wrote to say that employees could be let go if the minimum \nwage is increased.\n  Congress can best facilitate increased job creation and wages by \ndecreasing governmental interference in business and reducing taxes. I \nask unanimous consent that a recent Arizona Republic editorial that \nprovides a good summary of why raising the minimum wage is a bad idea \nbe reprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the editorial was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Arizona Republic, May 15, 1996]\n\n                            Maximum Politics\n\n       The tea-leaf readers in Washington predict congressional \n     approval of a hike in the nation's minimum wage, probably \n     coupled with some other tax-related legislation, in the next \n     few weeks. Alternative plans are to raise the wage, now at \n     $4.25 an hour, by 90 cents or $1.\n       What makes the vote to raise the minimum wage a near sure \n     thing is that it has nothing to do with economics. Indeed, \n     most economists say raising the minimum wage is likely to \n     hurt those its supporters say they intend to help: the poor.\n       It doesn't take a degree in economics to understand why. \n     Raise the price of labor to businesses and businesses are \n     likely to respond by trimming some jobs. How many is open to \n     debate. One familiar bench mark is that every 10 percent rise \n     in the minimum wage trims 1 percent to 2 percent of affected \n     jobs. Therefore, the legislation might endanger up to 200,000 \n     U.S. jobs.\n       But forget economics. As the Washington Post's Robert \n     Samuelson reports, it's election-year politics that's driving \n     the minimum-wage push. Plain and simple. Consider: President \n     Clinton says he's a backer of raising the wage. But in 1993 \n     and 1994, asks Samuelson, guess how many times he advocated \n     raising it when his party controlled Congress? Zero. Nada. \n     Zip. Nil.\n       In 1995 and the first part of 1996, by way of contrast, \n     Clinton has publicly thumped the tub for a minimum-wage hike \n     47 times by Samuelson's count. The economics of the argument \n     hasn't changed, but the politics has. The American public \n     overwhelmingly believes that raising the minimum wage is a \n     good idea. So, for politicians, the issue is a no-brainer.\n       What likely accounts for the strong public appeal for \n     raising the wage is that it seems like a decent thing to do. \n     Maybe some of us remember working for the minimum and think \n     back that it would have been nice to have a dollar more an \n     hour. Families can't live on $4.25 an hour these days, we \n     think. (But they'd get by even less easily without that job.)\n       Samuelson cites two myths he says are responsible for the \n     public's support for boosting the wage. The fact that some of \n     us remember earning it is a clue to one: that there's a \n     permanent group of workers stuck at the minimum. Not so. The \n     vast majority of minimum-wage workers quickly move up.\n       The other myth is that many minimum-wage workers are heads \n     of households. In fact, says Samuelson, the data show that \n     single parents make up only 3 percent of minimum-wage \n     workers. More often than not, the typical minimum-wage worker \n     is a teenager or young adult from a middle-class family or \n     the second part-time jobholder in a two-income family.\n       Will raising the minimum cause great economic harm? Hardly. \n     The loss of 200,000 jobs would cause hardly a ripple. Over \n     time, they'd likely be replaced. But is it good policy? Not \n     if the intent is to help poor people, who stand to lose some \n     economic opportunities as a result.\n       A better way to help the working poor would be to make tax \n     deductible the 6.2 percent of their wages they now are \n     required to pay in payroll taxes to fund Social Security. It \n     wouldn't add to the cost of labor, but would, according to \n     the tax reform commission chaired by former Congressman Jack \n     Kemp, give a boost to the incomes of 100 million U.S. workers \n     and boost the GDP by half a percentage point. It also would \n     end the unsavory practice of taxing a tax.\n       But good sense, economic or otherwise, is not what's \n     driving the minimum-wage push. Political capital is what's at \n     stake, and so long as it involves spending or jeopardizing \n     other people's money it comes cheap.\n\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, there are far too many people in Washington \nwho like to play fast and loose with other people's money. They are not \ncontent just to tax away a large share of people's hard-earned incomes \nto spend on government-knows-best programs. They even want to tell \npeople how they have to spend the money they have left over after \ntaxes.\n  They trust the American people so little that they feel they have to \ndictate what benefits they can receive and even what wages they can \nwork for. Combined with high taxes, it is a prescription for the kind \nof anemic economic growth and stagnating wages that have been plaguing \nthe Nation. It is like rearranging the deck chairs on the Titanic. The \neconomy is still in peril.\n  Mr. President, I contend that the way to get people off of minimum \nwage is to ensure that the economy is healthy and growing and providing \npeople with the opportunity to earn a better living for themselves and \ntheir families.\n  It is no coincidence that slow economic growth and stagnating wages \nhave predominated since the low-tax policies of the 1980's were \nabandoned in favor of the high-tax policies of the 1990's. As noted in \na recent report by the Institute for Policy Innovation, the economy has \ngrown by about 2.2 percent on average so far this decade. By \ncomparison, it grew at an average annual rate of 3.3 percent during the \nReagan years.\n  Had the economy done as well during the Bush and Clinton \nadministrations as it did under President Reagan, the economy would be \n$2.6 trillion larger than it is today. That would have added $21,000 to \nthe average family's income between 1990 and 1996. Annual revenues to \nthe Treasury would have been $90 billion greater, an amount that would \ncut this year's budget deficit by more than half.\n  So how do we promote the kind of growth that helped make everyone \nbetter off during the Reagan years? Cut taxes. As President John F. \nKennedy once said, ``An economy hampered with high tax rates will never \nproduce enough revenue to balance the budget, just as it will never \nproduce enough output and enough jobs.''\n  The tax relief provisions in this bill, H.R. 3448, are a modest first \nstep in the right direction. For example, we extend the tax exclusion \nfor employer-provided educational assistance, something that will help \npeople improve themselves and get ahead.\n  We extend the work opportunity credit and increase expensing for \nsmall businesses to encourage them to invest in new property and create \nnew jobs. We extend the research and experimentation tax credit, and \npermit non-working spouses the same opportunity to save in individual \nretirement accounts.\n  These and other changes in the law relating to S corporations and \npension law are good steps toward making tax policy more conducive to \neconomic growth and opportunity. I would add, however, that they are \nonly modest first steps. They are no substitute for the across-the-\nboard income tax rate reduction that many of us think would do far more \ngood for the economy.\n  The tax changes we are considering here are good and sound. If we had \nthe opportunity to vote on the merits, I would support them. However, \nthese modest changes are not sufficient to justify the high cost of the \nminimum wage increase being proposed --a cost that will be borne by \nemployees as much as employers.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I rise in support of the Kennedy amendment \nto raise the minimum wage and against the Bond amendment, which would \nretain the status quo and deny an increase for millions of low wage \nworkers.\n  Mr. President, we have just returned from the Independence Day \nrecess. I always value the time spent in Wisconsin during breaks in the \nSenate schedule. Not only does it mean going home, it means spending \ntime with people who work hard and work together by compromising in \ntheir daily lives.\n\n[[Page S7456]]\n\n  Hard-working families struggling to make it to the next pay-check do \nnot have the luxury to shirk responsibility or skip their work. They \nmust go to work every day and get the job done. That's why it shouldn't \nbe a surprise when the people of this country grow more and more \npessimistic, even angry, because Congress has yet to get the job done \nand pass meaningful legislation.\n  In the attempt to score political points and out-maneuver the other \nparty, legislation that is critical to working families has languished \nor been killed.\n  Instead of increasing investments in education and job training to \nprovide the foundation for a stronger economy, these programs have been \ncut. The earned income tax credit, which helps working poor families \nstay afloat, has been targeted for huge reductions. A bipartisan health \ncare reform bill that passed the Senate by a 100-0 vote has become \nstalled and may die because some want to poison the modest reforms with \ncontroversial provisions. Bipartisan campaign finance reform \nlegislation has been killed. And balanced budget legislation, which \neveryone agrees is needed to end deficit spending and shore up the \neconomy for our children's future, is now also on a partisan track to \nfailure.\n  Despite the odds that partisan politics may win the day, I remain \nhopeful that moderate proposals can still be enacted during this \nCongress. One of the most important bipartisan and moderate \nintitiatives is the minimum wage amendment offered by Senator Kennedy. \nThis amendment closely resembles the wage increase passed by the House \nof Representatives and excludes controversial provisions rejected by a \nmajority of House Members.\n  The Kennedy amendment would allow some of the hardest working \nAmerican's to make a better life for themselves and their families. It \nwould increase the minimum wage from the current level of $4.25 to \n$5.15 over 2 years. Granting a 90-cent wage increase over 2 years will \nhelp these families keep up with inflation and stay at or above the \npoverty level. Over 200,000 workers and their families in my State of \nWisconsin would benefit from the increase.\n\n  This amendment would be coupled with a series of tax breaks for small \nbusinesses to help offset the potential effects of the wage increase. I \nremain concerned about the challenges facing small businesses even \nthough many prominent economists argue that the modest increase \nproposed would not significantly jeopardize employment or business \nopportunities. So I am pleased that these tax breaks will help ensure \nthat any impact is minimal.\n  The Bond amendment is a stark contrast to this reasonable minimum \nwage proposal. Instead of starting the 2-year increase this year, the \nBond amendment would delay for 6 months the much needed raise. Further, \nthe Bond amendment holds down millions of American workers who are \nemployed at small businesses or who work in the restaurant industry by \ncarving out huge exclusions to the increase.\n  Anyone who has been on the job for less than 6 months would get no \nincrease. At least 4 million workers would be affected by this \npermanent submimimum wage. Under Senator Bond's proposal, another 2 \nmillion workers would be denied any increase because they work for \ntips. The complete exemption provided for companies that earn less than \n$500,000 annually would result in workers at two-thirds of all small \nbusinesses being left behind.\n  Supporters of these exclusions claim that the minimum wage increase \nwould devast small businesses. Even though it is arguable that \nsignificant negative effects would result from a modest minimum wage \nincrease, the proposal before us would provide 34 specific tax breaks \nfor small businesses.\n  History also argues against this claim. Since the last minimum wage \nincrease, far from being devasted, small businesses have helped spur \neconomic growth and bring our Nation out of recession. Under the Bond \namendment, scores of small businesses would be rewarded with generous \ntax breaks even though they would be exempted from raising the wages of \ntheir lowest paid workers.\n  Opponents of the minimum wage have also been quick to assert that \nminimum wage earners are mainly teenagers from middle class families. \nAgain, the facts tell a different story. Two-thirds of those paid the \nminimum wage are adults and a third of those are the sole household \nwage earners for their families. If granted the minimum wage increase \nwithout exclusions, over 2.3 million children from poor and near poor \nfamilies would benefit.\n  Mr. President, recent reports on the economy continue to show healthy \ngrowth and provide optimistic prospects for business. But although \nunemployment is down and millions of jobs have been created over the \npast 3 years, the average American worker remains uneasy.\n  With the strong economic growth, corporate CEO's have been rewarded \nwith sky-high salaries and impressive benefits. In contrast, real wages \nhave become stagnant for many Americans and their standard of living \nhas decreased over the years. Perhaps more disturbing, working families \nhave seen their health benefits eroded and opportunities for child care \ndiminished.\n  The Congress cannot create complete equity in the work force and \nresolve all of the challenges of working families. That is not \nrealistic and ignores the fundamentals of our economy. But there are \nactions Congress can take that will make a real difference.\n  We can help ensure health security by reforming the health insurance \nmarket; we can provide child care and education opportunities by \nbalancing Federal investments in these programs; and I still believe we \ncan balance the Federal budget in a fair manner. Today we can and must \nhelp the lowest wage workers by passing a long-over due minimum wage \nincrease. The House of Represenatives has already done so, it is now \ntime for the Senate to act.\n  Mr. President, 5 years have elapsed since the minimum wage was \nincreased and the real value of the wage has fallen by nearly 50 cents \nover that period. Furthermore, the real value of the minimum wage is 29 \npercent lower than it was in 1979. Without action, the value of the \nminimum wage will plummet to a 40-year low by 1997. Do people really \nbelieve that working at $4.25 an hour, which amounts to $8,500 a year, \nis a fair and livable wage?\n  To deny America's lowest paid workers a sustaining wage during a time \nof substantial budget cuts simply represents misguided priorities. This \nis precisely the time when we need to reward the people who work. If we \nare going to cut funding for education and training and reform welfare, \nwe must provide individuals with the economic tools necessary to get \nahead.\n  The last minimum wage increase under President Bush enjoyed broad \nbipartisan support. I urge my colleagues in the Senate to undertake a \nsimilar bipartisan effort today and demonstrate their commitment to \nworking families by restoring the fair value of the minimum wage.\n  The Senate is faced with a critical choice that will determine \nwhether or not the minimum wage increase becomes a reality this year. \nOne amendment would provide a modest minimum wage increase to the \nworking poor; the other would grant an increase to some workers, but \nleave millions of Americans with stagnant wages and result in a certain \npresidential veto. Let us do the right thing by passing the Kennedy \namendment and rejecting the Bond amendment.\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Mr. President, I rise in support of the amendment \noffered by the chairman and ranking member of the Finance Committee--\nthe so-called managers' amendment. I just want to take a moment to \ncomment on a few of the provisions of the amendment that are very \nimportant to churches and ministers in my home State of South Dakota.\n  Specifically, there are three provisions in the managers' amendment \nthat are taken from S. 881, the Church Retirement Benefits \nSimplification Act, introduced by friends and colleagues from Iowa and \nArkansas, Senators Grassley and Pryor. This bill already has 34 \ncosponsors. One of the provisions in S. 881 was included in the House-\npassed version of the underlying legislation we are considering today. \nThis provision would respond to the Internal Revenue Service retreat \nfrom its four-decade-old policy of not taxing parsonage allowances paid \nto retired clergy. The provision would clarify\n\n[[Page S7457]]\n\nthat all retirement benefits of clergy are not subject to self-\nemployment taxes.\n  The three additional provisions of S. 881 that are included in the \nmanagers' amendment address the churches' concerns regarding the \ntreatment of chaplains and foreign missionaries and the application of \nnondiscrimination rules designed for secular employers to church \npension plans.\n  First, the manager's amendment would clarify that chaplains may \ncontinue to participate in denominational pension plans. Under current \nlaw, chaplains who work outside the church, serving in hospitals, \njails, and other secular organizations, are not expressly allowed to \nparticipate in their denomination's pension plan. Often, chaplains may \nleave their church to work in a secular organization for only a brief \nperiod of time, and it makes little sense for Congress to force those \nchaplains to participate in the secular pension plan instead of the \ndenominational one. The managers' amendment simply would clarify that \nchaplains may participate in their denomination's plan without \ninadvertently violating pension coverage and related rules.\n  Second, the managers' amendment would facilitate the ability of \nforeign missionaries to participate in their denominational pension \nplan. This amendment would promote sound retirement policy while also \nbenefiting the foreign missionaries who are America's humanitarian \nemissaries abroad.\n  Finally, the managers' amendment would authorize the Secretary to \ndevelop a safe harbor from the nondiscrimination rules for those church \nplans that were left out when Congress exempted most church plans from \nthe same nondiscrimination rules. Although the IRS has issued a self-\nimposed moratorium on enforcement of these nondiscrimination rules for \nchurch plans, that moratorium ends soon. This amendment would give the \nSecretary of the Treasury the authority to develop a safe harbor plan \nfor the pension plans of the Catholic dioceses, the Episcopalian \nChurch, and the Presbyterian Church. These churches simply do not have \nthe infrastructure to prove compliance with the nondiscrimination rules \nwhich apply to secular employers.\n  Again, I want to commend the two managers--Chairman Roth and Senator \nMoynihan--for their assistance in addressing the concerns of the \nchurches in this legislation. Thanks to their leadership, we can \ncorrect and clarify the laws to ensure that they not unduly burden \nchurch retirement plans and the clergy and lay workers who participate \nin them.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I rise in support of the amendment to H.R. \n3448 offered by the chairman of the Small Business Committee, Senator \nBond. I also support the Finance Committee's amendment to the tax title \nof that bill, which already has been adopted.\n  For once, with the inclusion of these amendments in H.R. 3448, \nCongress would be looking at an issue in context and taking in the big \npicture. Both amendments are necessary to make this an acceptable bill, \non balance.\n  This bill is supposed to be named the ``Small Business Job Protection \nAct of 1996.''\n  Title I, the tax title, is consistent with that spirit. It would make \nthe Tax Code a little fairer, improve economic and employment \nopportunities, and provide some necessary tax relief.\n  However, unless the Senate adopts the Bond amendment as well, this \nbill will not be worthy of its name. It will not protect small \nbusiness. And it will hurt the low-wage breadwinners it is supposed to \nhelp.\n  I commend Senator Bond and Senator Roth for the work they have done \non their amendments.\n  All too often, past Congresses have taken a perceived problem; put it \nunder a microscope; and tried to address it with a one-size-fits-all \nFederal mandate. The result often has been Government by anecdote. \nUnintended consequences and innocent bystanders have not always been \ntaken into account in the rush to adopt a feel-good solution.\n  That risk of unintended consequences is definitely present in the \ncase of proposals to increase the Federal minimum wage.\n  We feel for those Americans who are working hard at making ends meet. \nIt is easy and it is tempting to look at a $4.25 an hour minimum wage \nand say, let's just mandate an increase in that wage. But that would be \nthe wrong answer.\n  Standing alone, an arbitrary increase in the minimum wage destroys \njobs for the very persons it is meant to help--the working poor and \nentry-level employees.\n  Common sense, the laws of economics, and experience all tell us this. \nThere is no dispute over this fact, except from some inside the \nWashington, DC, beltway and from some academicians with a political \nagenda.\n  We've all heard the numbers. The commonly accepted figure is that, an \narbitrary, stand-alone increase in the minimum wage from $4.25 an hour \nto $5.15--a 21-percent increase--would result in the loss of 621,000 \njobs. In Idaho, it would destroy 3,200 jobs.\n  Some have suggested that the economic impact of such an increase is \nnegligible. But it's not negligible for each one of those 621,000 \nAmericans--or possibly more--who would lose their jobs as a result. In \nmany cases, the job lost would be the most important one that person \nwill ever have--his or her first job.\n  The Bond Amendment takes a fair and balanced approach that would \nminimize the harm that would come from a one-size-fits-all, federally \nmandated increase in the minimum wage. It would treat small employers \nfairly and would be good for those entry-level workers most in need of \nmaking it to the first rung on the ladder of economic opportunity.\n  Unlike the amendment defeated in the House, the small business \nexemption in the Bond Amendment would apply only to the minimum wage \nincrease in this bill.\n  Mr. President, most Senators were serving in Congress in 1989. We \nremember what happened when we finally voted for a compromise minimum \nwage bill then. Everyone--if you read the Record, you will see \neveryone--thought and said there was a small business exemption in that \nbill for every small business with gross receipts of less than \n$500,000. That bill would not have passed in 1989 without that $500,000 \nexemption. Everyone understood that the 1989 compromise would increase \nthe small business threshold from $362,500 to $500,000 and broaden the \nexemption from some service and retail employers to all enterprises.\n  But then, a bureaucrat at the Department of Labor noticed an apparent \ndrafting error. The bill's language was convoluted and was interpreted \nas applying the Fair Labor Standards Act to virtually every individual \nemployee in the country, regardless of the employer's receipts. I say \nit was an apparent drafting error because everyone thought there was a \nuniversal, $500,000 threshold, and I do not want to accuse anyone of \nlying to the Congress or the President back in 1989.\n  Correcting this apparent drafting error had been a bipartisan effort \nup until recent weeks. Democrat Members in both the Senate and the \nHouse previously introduced bills to restore this intended exemption, \nin bills that would have gone farther than the Bond Amendment.\n  In recent years, small businesses have created every net new job in \nthis country. They take the risks of hiring and training new workers. \nThey do not have the economies of scale of large businesses and suffer \na disproportionate impact from Government regulation. They tend to be \nlabor intensive. If you drive up the costs of their labor, they will be \nforced to create fewer jobs.\n  In fact, 77 percent of the economists who responded to a survey of \nthe American Economics Association agreed that, by itself, a higher \nmandated minimum wage would have a negative impact on employment.\n  Obviously, that negative impact is going to fall on workers at or \nnear the minimum wage, and especially those who are the least-skilled \nand need an entry-level job the most. The Bond amendment would \nsafeguard the most vulnerable employees, those of the smallest \nbusinesses, against that impact.\n  The Bond amendment also includes a realistic opportunity wage, or \ntraining wage.\n  Realistically, the Federal minimum wage today already is a training \nwage. The average minimum wage worker is earning $6.06 an hour after 1 \nyear.\n\n[[Page S7458]]\n\n  In most work places, at every level of compensation, it is common for \na new employee to be paid more after a few months. That is because \nthere is almost always a learning curve, during which the employer is \ninvesting time, energy, and money in training and acclimating the new \nemployee. The opportunity wage in this amendment simply reflects that \nreality of labor economics.\n  Some critics have said the training wage would allow churning of \nemployees--the firing of employees when they become eligible for the \nnew, higher, minimum wage, and replacing them with new hires at the \ntraining wage. The Bond amendment makes that practice specifically \nillegal.\n  Finally, the Bond amendment would provide employers--especially small \nbusinesses with limited resources and profit margins that are slim or \nnonexistent--with a more realistic effective date for this bill.\n  Unlike the Federal Government, employers make reasonable projections \nof their revenues and then budget their resources to live within those \nmeans. To impose an immediate increase in costs of thousands of dollars \nwould be a cruel jolt to many small, vulnerable employers. To do so \nretroactively, as would happen under the Kennedy amendment or the \nHouse-passed bill, would be unconscionable.\n  The Bond amendment would provide the necessary flexibility to protect \nthe workers and small businesses that would be most vulnerable to a \none-size-fits all mandate. It is an important part of a two-step \nprocess to improve this bill. The second step is the inclusion of the \ntax provisions that would provide essential relief for small \nbusinesses, help them create jobs, and make the Tax Code a little \nfairer.\n  I particularly want to express my support and appreciation for \nseveral of the tax provisions in title I of this bill, including:\n  Increasing the availability of spousal individual retirement \naccounts; revising and extending the work opportunity tax credit, which \nwill help employers hire and retain disadvantaged employees; restoring \nand extending the tax exclusion for employer-provided educational \nassistance; making S-corporation rules more flexible; providing fairer \ntreatment for dues paid to agricultural or horticultural organizations; \nextending the research and experimentation tax credit; and improving \ndepreciation and expensing rules for small businesses.\n  I have supported these provisions consistently in the past and \ncommend the Finance Committee for including them in this bill.\n  There is at least one provision in the House-passed version of this \nbill that I hope the Senate would accept in conference: Restoring and \nmaking permanent the exclusion from FUTA--the Federal unemployment \ntax--for labor performed by a temporary, legal, immigrant agricultural \nworker. Such employees are ineligible for FUTA benefits that are \nfinanced by this tax. Therefore, this tax is imposed on employers for \nno reason, except that the previous exclusion simply expired.\n  The Finance Committee provisions are valuable and beneficial. And I \ncommend the chairman of the Small Business Committee for the thoughtful \napproach he has taken on his amendment. For me to vote for this bill, \nit would also be necessary for us to adopt the Bond amendment, which \nincludes essential safeguards for employees and small businesses alike, \nand make this package complete.\n\n\n                      higher education savings act\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I am pleased that the Finance Committee \nhas included my proposal to clarify both the tax treatment of the \nState-sponsored education savings plans and taxation of the \nbeneficiary's investment. This measure will put an end to the tax \nuncertainty that has hampered the effectiveness of these State-\nsponsored programs and help families who are trying to save for their \nchildren's higher education needs.\n  I have been working on this proposal since I first introduced S. 1787 \nin 1994. This Congress I have introduced S. 386 to provide families \nwith an incentive to save for college and put an end to the tax \nuncertainty regarding the State-sponsored programs. This legislation \nwill offer families an opportunity to save in order to keep pace with \nthe spiraling cost of education. S. 386 has been endorsed by the \nNational Association of State Treasurers, the National Association of \nState Scholarships and Grant Programs and the Kentucky Advocates for \nHigher Education.\n  Mr. President, the facts are clear. Education costs are outpacing \naverage wages, creating a barrier to attending college. Throughout the \n1980's education costs have risen by roughly double the rate of \ninflation. In 1983, tuition at the University of Kentucky and \nUniversity of Louisville rocketed 16.7 percent followed by an 11.2-\npercent increase in 1994. Since 1986, the cumulative percentage \nincrease in tuition at Kentucky's two largest public universities rose \nan astounding 82.3 percent.\n  Unfortunately, Kentucky's numbers are not extraordinary when compared \nto average tuition increases nationwide. Over the past 10 years, \ntuition rose by 81.7 percent for public universities and 95 percent for \nprivate schools compared to 46.6 percent increase in the median income \nfor the same period. Which brings us to the real problem: education \ncosts are quickly out-pacing income growth.\n  As tuition costs continue to increase, so does the need for \nassistance. In 1990, over 56 percent of all students accepted some form \nof financial assistance and the statistic was even higher for minority \nstudents. It is increasingly common for students to study now and pay \nlater. In fact, more students than ever are forced to bear additional \nloan costs in order to receive an education. In 1994, Federal education \nloan volume rose by 57 percent from the previous year. On top of that, \nstudents have increased the size of their loan burden by an average of \n28 percent. So not only are more students taking out loans, but they \nare taking out bigger loans as well.\n  Over the past decade, many States have tried to respond to the \nconcerns parents have raised regarding the affordability of a college \neducation. Today, 11 States, including Kentucky, have responded by \ndeveloping programs that will provide families with incentives to save \nover the long term to make college more affordable. Sixteen other \nStates are quickly moving to put into place their own education savings \nplans.\n  Currently, there are 500,000 participants investing over $2 billion \nin State-sponsored savings programs. In Kentucky, there are 2,700 \nparticipants with $4 million invested in their children's future. Under \nthis plan, participants don't have to be rich to benefit. In fact, the \naverage monthly contribution in Kentucky is just $47.22. This proposal \nrewards those who are serious about their future and are committed to \nthe education of their children.\n  The language included in this bill is a variation of my original \nlegislation. It provides tax-exempt status to qualified State tuition \nprograms. In November 1994, the U.S. Appeals Court ruled that the \nMichigan Education Trust is not subject to Federal income tax. Although \nthe circuit court was quite clear on this issue, it is my understanding \nthat the IRS continued to look for a different avenue to tap this \ngrowing investment pool. This proposal clarifies legislatively the tax \nstatus of these programs and puts and end to the uncertainty and \nconstant threat posed by the IRS. I am told by Kentucky's program \nadministrators that this tax clarification is their No. 1 priority and \nvital to the continued existence of the program.\n  This legislation will also clarify the tax treatment of the \ninvestment itself. As proposed in the recent Treasury regulations, the \nchild would be taxed on the earnings buildup at the time of \ndistribution. While my original legislation proposed the inside buildup \nbe fully tax exempt, I believe that this clarification is a significant \nreform and consistent with the limits of this bill. I want to assure \nevery one of my colleagues that I will reintroduce legislation and \ncontinue my efforts to make the inside buildup in this investment tax \nfree. Nonetheless, this proposal will be a tax cut for Kentucky \nparticipants since they have been forced to pay taxes annually to avoid \npossible penalties, while the IRS has been considering the tax \ntreatment of this investment.\n  This legislation is not a funding cure but is a serious effort to \nencourage long-term savings, by eliminating the tax disincentive to do \nso. Aside from\n\n[[Page S7459]]\n\nlimited assistance through bond programs, nothing has been done to \nencourage savings or decrease borrowing. I believe it is widely agreed \nthat it is in our best interest as a nation to maintain a quality \neducation system for everyone. We need to make a decision, however, on \nhow we will spend our limited resources to ensure that both access and \nquality are maintained.\n  Before I close, I would like to take a moment and commend Senators \nRoth, Graham, Shelby, and Breaux for their hard work and support of \nthis legislation. I appreciate their interest and look forward to \nworking with them in the future to make these investments tax exempt.\n\n\n                         Small Fishing Vessels\n\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, for almost 8 years hard-working owners of \nfishing vessels in New Bedford, MA have been subject to an Internal \nRevenue Service ruling that would result in approximately $11 million \nin penalties. This situation arises from an IRS misinterpretation of \nTax Code provisions as they applied to crew members on small fishing \nvessels. The IRS's interpretation and assessment is potentially \ndevastating to the fishing families in southeastern Massachusetts--a \nregion already struggling with the departure of the textile industry \nand the demise of the fishing industry. I am pleased that the managers \namendment to H.R. 3448 includes a section clarifying the application of \nthis disputed provision and making the original intention of the \nCongress clear with respect to it.\n  I have worked on this issue for many years along with the senior \nSenator from Massachusetts as well as colleagues in the other body, \nespecially Congressman Barney Frank, Congressman Gerry Studds and \nCongressman Richard Neal.\n  Mr. President, today the Senate is providing relief for four fishing \nvessels in New Bedford--F/V Edgartown, F/V Nordic Pride, F/V Lady J, F/\nV Seel--by rendering moot a court action against them. Central to the \ncase is the question of whether crewmembers on small fishing vessels \nare considered self-employed or employees for tax purposes. The pay of \nemployees is subject to withholding of Federal income tax while payment \nto persons who are self-employed is not subject to withholding.\n  Life on the seas requires fishermen to be ruggedly independent \nindividuals. Fishing boat operations reflect this independence in that \nthey are fundamentally small business operations with crews that \ntypically vary from trip to trip, with each crewmember acting as a free \nagent. Recognizing this unique arrangement on fishing vessels, Congress \namended the Tax Code in 1976 to clarify the employment status of \ncrewmembers as self-employed and required the self-employed crewmembers \nto be compensated solely with a share of the catch.\n  It is common practice in fishing communities around the country to \nprovide a small cash payment called a ``pers'' to the cook, first mate \nand engineer in recognition of additional duties they perform at sea. \nThese pers represent only 1 to 5 percent of the total compensation and \namount to approximately $500 annually based on a $30,000 income.\n  In 1977, the IRS issued Ruling 77-102 which stated that a pers \npayment would subject the entire salary of the pers recipient to \nwithholding. In response, the industry initiated a sliding scale per \nthat ranged from $24.50 to $25.50 depending on the catch. The IRS did \nnot question this practice until 1988 when the Service suddenly issued \nan unexpected interpretation of the pers payment and ruled \nretroactively that the entire salaries of crewmembers receiving pers \nwere subject to withholding. The IRS ruling means that much of the New \nBedford fleet does not qualify for the small fishing vessel treatment \non withholding and therefore each boat owner owed the IRS large amounts \nin back withholding for the fishermen who worked on them. As a result, \nIRS placed liens on property and is poised to begin enforced \ncollections from the boat owners which will be devastating to the New \nBedford fishing industry as it struggles to survive until the \ngroundfish stocks recover.\n  This bill will permit the pers payments--which are essentially \ncalculated as a share of the catch--without jeopardizing the self-\nemployment status of crewmembers. Let me emphasize, Mr. President, that \nthe boat owners believed they complied with the new tax laws and \nregulations, and in fact they did comply with the law as Congress \nintended it to be applied to small fishing vessels. The vessel owners \npaid the crew the amounts the IRS now claims should have been withheld, \nand the crewmembers, as contractors, were individually responsible for \npaying taxes due on those payments. To assess these boat owners now \nwould be grossly unfair and will have the effect of sinking the New \nBedford fleet.\n  Those of us trying to remedy this situation have been working for a \nsolution for 7 years. We have appealed to the Treasury Department and \nthe Internal Revenue Service, and introduced legislation that was \nvetoed twice by President Bush. Today, we are working against the clock \nas the Court of Appeals will soon hear the vessel owners appeal if this \nprovision of H.R. 3448 is not enacted into law.\n  Mr. President, this has been a long and difficult struggle to provide \nrelief for the fishing families of New Bedford. I am pleased we are on \nthe cusp of victory. Until the bill is signed by President Clinton, I \nwill continue to fight for these hard-working families in southeastern \nMassachusetts.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I am voting in favor of increasing the \nminimum wage because there has been no increase since 1989 while cost \nof living adjustments have been provided to others.\n  I am pleased to note that this bill, the Small Business Job \nProtection Act of 1996 provides benefits to small business which will \noffset their higher wage payments. Among important provisions to help \nsmall business, the bill as amended includes over $11 billion in tax \nincentives, such as tax incentives for employer-provided tuition aid, \nincreased expensing limits for small business equipment purchases, \npension simplification rules, and extension of expired tax credits for \nresearch and development, employment of certain targeted individuals, \nand the orphan-drug tax credit.\n  With respect to the minimum wage provisions of this bill, while I \nhave given serious consideration to the provision to exclude businesses \nwith less than $500,000 in annual revenues, I have decided to vote \nagainst the Bond amendment because of the provision that delays the \nincreased minimum wage for 6 months regardless of the age of the \nemployee. That would allow too much opportunity for circumventing the \nlaw by discharging employees just short of the 6-month period and \nemploying new people.\n  I am voting against the Kennedy amendment because I believe the \nprovisions of the underlying House bill provide a better balance with \nthe longer waiting period of 90 days before the new minimum wage must \nbe paid compared to only 30 days in the Kennedy amendment and because \nthe House bill provides more equitable treatment for restaurant owners \non the tip issue.\n  In this statement, I am including, at the manager's request, an \nexplanation for my amendment which will help small businesses in their \nefforts to operate defined benefit pension plans. This amendment will \nhelp small businesses in their efforts to comply with new stricter \nfunding rules enacted as a part of the Uruguay Round Agreements Act \n[GATT]. It gives the Internal Revenue Service [IRS] the authority, \nunder very limited circumstances, to waive the excise tax that is \nimposed on a company that fails to meet a liquidity requirement \nmandated under the new law.\n  By way of background, at least two small Pennsylvania companies, \nFreedom Forge Corp. of Burnham and Erie Forge Corp. of Erie were not \naware of the new liquidity requirements when they became effective less \nthan 1 month after the GATT enabling bill was enacted. The bill had no \ntransition rules that applied to the new liquidity requirements. I am \nadvised that the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation, the Federal \nagency with jurisdiction, called companies proactively to inform them \nof the new liquidity requirements, but that these two Pennsylvania \ncompanies are among the only companies not to receive such counseling. \nConsequently, these companies were unable to prepare for their new \nobligations in a timely manner and, I am informed, had to increase \ntheir pension plan funding by approximately 1,500 percent.\n\n  Once the companies became aware of the new law and the resulting \ndramatic\n\n[[Page S7460]]\n\nincrease in pension obligations, I understand that they acted as \nquickly as possible to come into full compliance with the law and \nremain in compliance today. However, because they did not receive the \nsame warning from the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation as other \ncompanies did, they are subject to a penalty excise tax for the first \nquarter in which they were not in compliance with the new law.\n  Currently, the Internal Revenue Service has no statutory authority to \nwaive the penalty excise taxes that apply in these instances, even \nwhere the contribution due the plan was due to reasonable cause and \nreasonable steps have been taken to remedy the liquidity shortfall. In \nthe absence of a legislative remedy, these companies will be forced to \npay penalties to the IRS because they did not immediately comply with a \nlaw they had no knowledge of, in spite of their proven best efforts to \nfund their pension plans once made aware of their new responsibilities \nunder the law. While ignorance of the law generally is not an excuse, I \nbelieve, Mr. President, that where the Government actually notified and \ncounseled companies, but not these, it is appropriate that the tax \npenalty be waived.\n  Accordingly, my amendment that the distinguished managers of the bill \nincluded in their package of amendments would provide authority to the \nIRS to waive the excise tax in those cases where the shortfall was due \nto reasonable cause and reasonable steps were taken to remedy the \nliquidity shortfall. In consulting with the Pension Benefit Guaranty \nCorporation about this problem and a possible legislative solution, I \nam advised that the agency said that their primary interest is ensuring \nthat pension plans have adequate funds to pay their benefits. The \nagency recognizes that some companies had difficulties complying with \nthe new liquidity requirements due to a lack of transition rule. \nTherefore, I am advised that the agency has no objections to my \namendment so long as it requires that reasonable steps have been taken \nto remedy the shortfall as a condition of the waiver, which my \namendment provides.\n  This change in law will enable Freedom Forge Corp., Erie Forge Corp. \nand any other company that may find itself in a similar circumstance to \nbe treated with fairness. Without fair pension laws, small companies \nwill be unlikely to undertake this substantial responsibility. As \nlegislators, we should be encouraging small employers to provide a \npension plan for their employees, not discouraging them. Therefore, I \ncommend Chairman Roth for his understanding of pension policy and for \nincluding this important amendment in the managers' amendments package.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, the Small Business Job Protection Act of \n1996 includes two essential and much-needed provisions that I've \nsupported for years. Together, these provisions will extend for 3 years \nthe tax credit for employer provided educational assistance to workers, \nand it will allow spouses to invest fully in tax-deferred individual \nretirement accounts even though they are not employed outside of their \nhomes.\n  Reauthorization of the employer provided education tax credit, \ncodified at section 127 of the IRS Code, will enable American workers \nto provide for their families in a more substantial way. First \nauthorized in 1978, this provision has helped more than 7 million \nworking Americans to further their education and to acquire additional \nskills.\n  Mr. President, earlier this year I introduced Senate Concurrent \nResolution 57 to extend this critically needed tax provision. I was \ngratified and encouraged when this resolution was adopted. Now, it's \ntime for the Senate to act on the commitment expressed in Senate \nConcurrent Resolution 57 and extend the credit through December 31, \n1997.\n  Mr. President, this Congress approved a reauthorization of this tax \ncredit in the Balanced Budget Act of 1995. Notwithstanding his rhetoric \nin support of education, the President vetoed the bill, and prevented \nthe extension of this urgently needed education tax credit, while \nsowing uncertainty among the workers and employers who were \nunderstandably relying upon these tax-free benefits.\n  This uncertainty is particularly acute among workers and employers in \nareas undergoing sweeping economic changes. In my State of North \nCarolina, thousands of textile workers have lost their jobs in recent \nyears, while other industries have experienced phenomenal growth. \nExtension of this credit will help all workers by encouraging employers \nto provide tax-free education benefits to their employees, thereby \nbenefiting employers by improving worker skills while benefiting their \nworkers by reducing concerns about job security.\n  Mr. President, perhaps the case for extending this credit was made \nmost eloquently by two distinguished North Carolinians. Representative \nof employer concerns, Nan Keohane, president of Duke University in \nDurham, NC, wrote to me saying that:\n\n       We at Duke believe it is important for our employees to \n     achieve their educational goals and to acquire the skills \n     they need to succeed in an increasingly complex society. The \n     ability to exclude education benefits from personal income \n     tax is obviously important to our own employees, and \n     particularly to those who otherwise could not afford the \n     educational costs that the tax on these benefits would \n     require.\n\n  Typical of letters from workers who have written to me is one by Jeff \nStanley, a fine young man who works for Motorola in Research Triangle \nPark. Jeff has been working toward a Bachelors Degree in Business \nAdministration at North Carolina Wesleyan College; he is close to \ncompleting it. However, his employer-provided education benefits are, \nhe says, ``taxed at approximately 40 percent'' and that ``[t]his extra \nexpense is causing a financial hardship. I would very much like to \ncomplete my degree within the next year, but due to the extra expense \nof the taxation, I may have to delay the completion.''\n\n  Passage of the Small Business Job Protection Act will ensure that \nJeff Stanley can complete his education without those benefits being \nmade subject to a 40-percent tax rate, the effect of which is to \ndiscourage pursuit of a life-long education goal. This time, I hope the \nPresident will permit this important provision to become law.\n  Another provision of the bill proposes that spouses may invest fully \nin an individual retirement account. Current law prohibits these \nworking spouses from investing more than $250 in an IRA. Yet, if the \nsame spouse works outside the home, he or she is able to participate \nfully in IRA tax-deferred investments--to the tune of $2,000 per year.\n  The Small Business Job Protection Act eliminates this double-standard \nand recognizes the value of those who labor in the home. In the \nprocess, it will benefit the estimated 18.6 million households with \nmarried couples. Many of those households include a parent who chooses \nto work at home, frequently sacrificing more lucrative careers for the \nmore rewarding job of raising children. It's common sense that the tax \ncode shouldn't discourage these parents from working in the home.\n  Mr. President, the IRS Code is a testament to the big-spending \nleviathan known as the Federal Government. In addition to over-taxing \nAmerican citizens, the Code contains countless irrational provisions \nwhich ought to be scrapped. It's too bad that politics caused this bill \nto be burdened with an unwise increase in the minimum wage; rammed down \nthe throats of countless thousands of small businesses who will have to \neliminate untold numbers of entry-level jobs that are so meaningful to \nyoung workers today.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/07/09/senate-section/article/S7421-6", "month": "07", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "09", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7460-S7461]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      UNANIMOUS-CONSENT AGREEMENTS\n\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM.

Mr. President, I am happy to yield 8 minutes to my \ndistinguished friend and fellow member of the Finance Committee, \nSenator Graham of Florida.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I wish to speak briefly on a provision \nwhich I hope will be included in this bill at the time we take our \nfinal vote. It is a provision which is of great importance to working \nparents and their children across America.\n  For years, one of the major challenges to American families has been \nhow to plan for their children's educational future. This challenge has \nbeen exacerbated in recent years due to the continued rising costs of \ncollege education.\n  In response to this challenge, over the past 10 years States have \nformed innovative partnerships with families. These are typically known \nas prepaid college tuition plans. These plans, although not \nstructurally identical, share a common purpose. These plans allow \nparents to pay in advance for a child's tuition at a participating \ncollege or university, thereby locking in today's tuition prices, \nguaranteeing the child's access to a future college education. The \nState then takes the funds which have been paid by the participant, \ntypically the parent, and invests them in a way that keeps pace with \nthe cost of college education. These programs are designed so that \npeople of moderate means can help their children realize the dream of a \ncollege education. For instance, the typical Florida family \nparticipating in this program earns approximately $50,000 a year.\n  These programs are also tailored to maximize flexibility. Families \ncan either purchase a prepaid tuition contract with a lump sum or, if \nthey choose, they can pay the child's education in monthly \ninstallments. These plans, therefore, are affordable. For instance, \nthose families who opt to invest on a monthly basis in my State of \nFlorida put aside an average of about $53 a month, roughly the price of \ncable television service.\n\n  This affordability has made prepayment programs enormously successful \nin Florida and across the Nation. Most importantly, at a time when the \nnext generation will struggle to provide for the financial security of \nits children, prepaid college programs provide a powerful incentive for \nfamilies to save, to invest in their futures, to provide for some \nsecurity when an unexpected tragedy occurs.\n  Let me share with you an example of such an unexpected tragedy. Mr. \nand Mrs. Daniel Gilliland enrolled their sons, Sean and Patrick, in the \nFlorida program in 1988, the first year of its existence. Four years \nlater, Sean entered the University of Florida as a freshman in the fall \nof 1992. In 1994, the father, Daniel Gilliland, died unexpectedly, just \nas the younger son Patrick was about to go to the University of Florida \nfor his freshman year. The death of Daniel Gilliland was devastating to \nthe family, but because the Gillilands were able to participate in the \nFlorida prepaid college program both children were able to go on with \ntheir lives and continue their education. I will quote from a letter \nfrom Mrs. Gilliland, which I ask unanimous consent be printed in the \nRecord immediately after my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. GRAHAM. She states, ``By expecting the unexpected, we were able \nto give both sons an education at a fine university that would \ncertainly otherwise have been difficult for me as a single parent.''\n  When Daniel died, I silently offered ``thanks that we had the \nforesight and chance to participate in this program.''\n  Today, Sean is a senior at the University of Florida, ready to \ngraduate with a degree in business. Patrick maintains a 3.6 average, \nwhile working toward a degree in athletic training.\n  Mr. President, it is because of success stories like the Gilliland's \nthat the prepaid college programs are flourishing. Twelve States \nalready have operating programs. Those States are those depicted in \ngreen on this map. Four States depicted in yellow will begin tuition \nprograms this year, and a dozen more are moving towards enacting \nprepaid tuition legislation, those depicted in red.\n  As an example, the Texas prepaid tuition program, which was set up \nthis year, receives 4,000 inquiries a day and enrolled 40,000 \nparticipants within the first few weeks of implementing the program.\n  In Florida, 376,000 families are currently participating in the \nprogram; 40,000 participants join each year.\n  Why, in the face of this great success, are we considering Federal \nlegislation to affect State prepaid tuition plans? The reason is \nbecause early this year the taxation of these plans was called into \nquestion by the Internal Revenue Service. The IRS contacted six States \nwith operating programs and informed them that the IRS intended to do \ntwo things: First, the IRS stated that it would treat the State fund as \na taxable corporation rather than a tax-exempt government entity. \nObviously, this action would make it difficult for States to meet their \nobligation to families under the plan. Second, the IRS stated that \nfamilies should have to pay tax annually on the interest income earned \non amounts transferred to the fund.\n  Mr. President, it just does not make sense to me that an individual \nwho purchases a tuition contract should have to pay tax every year on \nthe earnings on the funds. First, the contributor has surrendered \ncontrol of his funds. He or she can only get money back if a student \ndies or should not qualify for college. And then, under most plans, the \nState refunds only the principal. Second, the contributor does not have \naccess to the funds to pay the tax, since the money contributed to the \ntuition contract now belongs to the fund itself.\n  Given the fact that most who contribute to the fund are of modest \nmeans, it is a tremendous disincentive to investing in education to \nmake contributors pay tax on interest income for up to 18 years before \nthe child goes to college.\n  Because we felt so strongly about this issue, a bipartisan group of \nSenators, including Senators McConnell, Breaux, and Shelby, decided to \ndo something about it. In discussions with the administration and the \nDepartment of Treasury we were able to get the IRS to revisit this \nissue. I am pleased to report that on June 11 of this year, the IRS \nissued new rules that will temporarily exempt State tuition plans from \ninterest income taxation. This matter has not been settled. The \nDepartment of Treasury has asked for help from Congress, asking us to \nclarify the tax treatment of these plans. Until we act, the financial \nfuture of these plans, along with the education of over a half-million \nparticipants nationwide, remains in limbo. This bill will clarify that \nthese State programs are not taxable and that the earnings on the fund \nwill not be taxed until the child goes to college.\n  Removing the specter of Federal taxation from these plans is \nparticularly appropriate at this time, a time when Congress should be \ntrying to foster innovative programs among the States and encouraging \nfamilies' efforts to save and invest for their children's future.\n  I would like to particularly thank Senator Roth and Senator Moynihan \nfor their support and assistance in including this important provision \nin the legislation. With enactment of this legislation, parents and \nchildren will be able to rest easier, knowing that Congress has done \nthe right thing in protecting their investment and protecting their--\nand our--Nation's future.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n\n                                     Mrs. Daniel D.

Gilliland.\n\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York is recognized.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I am sure I can speak for the chairman, \nSenator Roth, when I say to Senator Graham of Florida that it is we who \nare indebted to him for having brought this matter to the committee, \nset forth the issues with clarity and succinctness, and won unanimous \nsupport for obviously an important subject--important not just to \nFlorida but, as the map shows, to States across the Nation.\n  I see Senator Conrad has risen. I am happy to yield 8 minutes to him.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York has 5 minutes \nremaining at this time.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. I ask unanimous consent if I might use 3 minutes of the \nleader's time for Senator Conrad.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator may do that.\n  The Senator from North Dakota is recognized.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I support the Small Business Job \nProtection Act of 1996 and urge my colleagues to join me in supporting \nthis legislation. The Senate Finance Committee made a series of \nbipartisan changes in the bill as it came from the House, led by our \nchairman and ranking member, the Senator from New York. I want to \npublicly commend them for the outstanding job they did in improving \nthis legislation. I especially want to single out the ranking member \nwho has, as always, made enormous contributions to this finished \nproduct. I think this is a significant improvement over what was sent \nto the committee.\n  The bill raises the minimum wage by 90 cents over the next 2 years. I \nthink everybody who has been following this debate understands that. \nThe current minimum wage is at a 40-year low in purchasing power. Maybe \nI need to repeat that, because I think it is a stunning fact. We are \nnot talking about a 4-year low, we are talking about a 40-year low in \nterms of its purchasing power.\n  I brought this chart that shows what the minimum wage has been from \n1960 to the end of 1995 in purchasing power. As we can see, the minimum \nwage has been all over the map over this period of time. Without \nexception, it has been higher than it is today. It is time to act. It \nis the right thing to do. It is the fair thing to do.\n  Over the past 2 years, I and many others have supported welfare \nreform that encourages adult, able-bodied welfare recipients to work. \nHowever, any welfare to workfare reform, to be effective, must be \naccompanied by a living wage for those who do work. I do not know how \nanybody can seriously advocate welfare reform as it has been talked \nabout in this Chamber and fail to support a living wage for those who \ndo work. That is fair. That is what we ought to do.\n  The legislation before us also contains numerous provisions to help \nsmall businesses. I come from a State of shopkeepers, farmers, and \nsmall manufacturers. My State has many very small businesses. I was \njust telling a colleague that a cousin of mine ran a small gift shop in \nmy hometown of Bismarck, ND. I know something about that business. I \nknow that it provided a modest income. I am not going to use those \nfigures here because back home people would know exactly who I am \ntalking about and I would be breaking faith with a treasured relative. \nBut I can tell you, I know what happens to small businesses. I used to \nbe the tax commissioner of my State.\n  I have looked at the books and records of literally hundreds of \nbusinesses in my State, and I think I understand very, very clearly the \npressure that an increase in the minimum wage puts on small business \nowners. I have evaluated it very carefully, and think I fully \nappreciate its effects.\n  Mr. President, I say to those small business owners in my State who \nhave been strong supporters of mine, it is time now to increase this \nminimum wage. It is the right thing to do. It is the fair thing to do. \nI know it is going to mean difficulty for some. I regret that. But I \nalso know there are literally thousands of people in my State who are \ndependent on this minimum wage to provide for their families' incomes.\n  Today, that family income, for those who are on the minimum wage, is \n$8,800 a year. I defy anyone to explain to me how you live on $8,800 a \nyear, even with a very small family, even if it is a single person--\n$8,800 a year.\n  To offset the effect on small businesses, we have included many \nprovisions to help small businesses. I am strongly supportive of those \nprovisions. The key provision increases the amount of investment small \nbusinesses can expense from the current $17,500 per year to $25,000 per \nyear. That is a tax savings of up to $2,900 a year when it is fully \nphased in.\n  Mr. President, these sound like modest amounts. They are modest \namounts, but when you talk about the very small businesses in my State, \nthey make a difference. It will be a tremendous help to thousands of \nsmall businesses and farmers in North Dakota.\n  In addition, the legislation contains a series of provisions \nreforming subchapter S corporations. Again, my State has hundreds and \nhundreds of subchapter S corporations. My wife, when she was in the \nprivate sector, had a subchapter S corporation. I am very familiar with \nthe operations of those businesses. These changes are long overdue.\n  I think the business community is going to welcome a key provision \nthat increases the number of allowable stockholders from 35 to 75 and \nallows S corporations to have subsidiaries.\n  These and other changes will allow S corporations to grow and invest, \ncreating jobs and a better future for literally millions of Americans.\n  For working families, the most important changes in the bill provide \nfor simplified pension plans for small businesses. Again, not only will \nthe employees be the beneficiaries, the owners of these businesses will \nbe the beneficiaries. Anybody who has gone through the paperwork \nrequired of pension plans for small businesses knows what I am talking \nabout. The rules as currently constituted are a nightmare for small \nbusiness owners. These provisions are going to improve that \ncircumstance dramatically.\n  Mr. President, I again salute the ranking member of the Finance \nCommittee, the senior Senator from New York, for the outstanding effort \nthat was made in the Finance Committee to improve these provisions.\n  The savings incentive match plan for employees [SIMPLE] reduces \ncompliance and reporting requirements for small businesses with 100 or \nfewer employees. Businesses will be able to offer either IRA's or \n401(k) plans.\n  Mr. President, for families in which one spouse decides to stay at \nhome to care for children, this bill allows for a full IRA contribution \nof up to $2,000. This will remove the penalty that is in the current \ncode with respect to spouses who are at home.\n  In this legislation, the Congress recognizes the work of raising \nchildren to be productive members of society is just as important--many \nof us believe more important--than paid work. In fact, it is the most \nimportant job of any in our society.\n  These are dramatic improvements to current law that will allow \nmillions of Americans to provide for their retirement. In doing so, the \nsavings generated will help provide for the investment needed for \neconomic growth and prosperity.\n  The Senate Finance Committee also provided for the extension of a \nnumber of important tax incentives. Specifically, the targeted jobs tax \ncredit is extended and renamed the ``work opportunity tax credit.'' \nThis tax credit provides incentives for businesses to hire difficult-\nto-place workers.\n\n[[Page S7463]]\n\n  Second, the research and experimentation tax credit and the orphan \ndrug tax credit are extended. These assure that the private sector is \nencouraged to develop new technologies and new drugs.\n  For my State and many others with lignite and low-rank coals, this \nlegislation extends a tax credit incentive to produce and market \nalternative, environmentally friendly energy products. It will help \nhigh-technology energy businesses find investors who are willing to \nbuild multimillion dollar plants using new technologies to bring these \nalternative fuels to market.\n  In closing, I wish to raise two issues. First, these tax benefits \nmust be paid for. Unfortunately, one of the major sources of the \nfunding is the extension of the airline ticket tax. This tax made sense \nwhen airline ticket prices were regulated. Under regulation, prices in \nsmall markets served by one or two airlines were basically the same as \nprices in large, heavily traveled, highly competitive markets. That is \nno longer true. Deregulation brought higher ticket prices to many rural \nstates and smaller cities. Compounding that inequity, the 10-percent \ntax places a larger burden for supporting the Federal Aviation \nAdministration on small markets.\n  That is simply unfair. The airline ticket tax needs a major overhaul. \nThe burden of paying for the FAA should not fall disproportionately on \nsmall markets. While this extension of the ticket tax will undoubtedly \npass because it is attached to a bill that has so many positive \nbenefits, we need to get about the business of reform before any \nadditional extensions are made. Rural States like North and South \nDakota, Montana, and Nebraska as well as small cities in every State \nwill benefit from reform.\n  We must also begin to develop new approaches to help stabilize the \nrural economy. Senator Hatch, Senator Harkin and others have drafted \nlegislation to encourage the development of farmer-owned food-\nprocessing cooperatives. While the prices of raw commodities fluctuate \nwildly from year-to-year depending on the weather, processed-food \nprices are far more stable. Farmers need to be able to process some of \ntheir own production for the market in order to stabilize their \nincomes. Farmers can do that through farmer-owned cooperatives. I \napplaud the efforts of Senators Hatch and Harkin and others. I hope \nthat their legislation can be added to this bill in conference as a way \nto help bring some economic stability to the highly volatile farm \nsector.\n  This small business legislation may be the most important piece of \nlegislation Congress addresses this year. So far, this legislation has \nenjoyed bipartisan support. I recommend its passage without amendments. \nThat would kill any chance of the legislation becoming law.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas is recognized.\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM. Mr. President, I yield 4 minutes of the leader's time \nto the Senator from Texas.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Thank you, Mr. President, and I thank the Senator \nfrom Kansas for her leadership on this very important issue.\n  Mr. President, I want to speak specifically about the homemaker IRA \npart of this bill. The homemaker IRA was put forward 3 years ago by \nmyself and Senator Mikulski. It now has 62 cosponsors. This is a matter \nof simple fairness and equity. I cannot believe that we are standing \nhere today talking about this issue, because if you work outside the \nhome, you can set aside $2,000 a year which accrues tax free for your \nretirement security. But if you are a homemaker working at home, \nraising your children, contributing to this country and its stability, \nyou are allowed to set aside $250 a year.\n  If we can pass the homemaker IRA and allow the homemakers of this \ncountry to be equal in their ability to contribute to their retirement \nsecurity for a one-income-earner couple, the difference will be \n$188,554 for a 30-year accumulation at $2,000 a year versus $335,000, a \ndifference of $150,000, roughly. That is the difference in retirement \nsecurity that we can make today if we can pass this very important \nbill.\n  The homemaker IRA had also been passed in the Balanced Budget Act \nlast year. It was included. It was vetoed by the President. This is a \nbill I hope we will be able to see signed by the President. It is very \nimportant for the many small business advantages, as well as the \nhomemaker advantages in retirement security. It is very important that \nwe send the bill to the President and that he sign it.\n  This is a big bill. It is a bill that has a lot in it. It has the \nminimum wage, we have the Bond amendment, and we have the Kennedy \namendment. I am very concerned about the potential of adopting the \nKennedy amendment, which is a retroactive minimum wage increase and the \nfact that that could kill the homemaker IRA bill, because I cannot vote \nfor a retroactive increase in wages that someone who is now in the \nmiddle of the summer, who might have an inn or a restaurant and has set \nprices according to what the wage scale is to all of a sudden wake up \nand find that the costs are 20-percent higher.\n  I cannot vote for that. I think it is wrong. So I hope that we will \nbe able to pass this bill in a responsible way with some exceptions for \nsmall business to give them the ability to continue to compete because \nthey do not have the advantages of the efficiencies of a large \nbusiness.\n  I hope that we will be able to pass the Bond amendment which will \nhave a minimum wage increase but one that can be provided and planned \nfor, one that will have some small business exemptions so that they \nwill still be able to compete.\n  I hope we can put together a package that will be signed by the \nPresident that will be bipartisan, that will have the Bond amendment \nprotections of our small business people as we are also protecting the \nhomemakers and the people who are not now allowed to set aside $2,000 a \nyear for their retirement security but could if they worked outside the \nhome.\n  I commend Senator Kassebaum and Senator Mikulski who have been \nworking on homemaker IRA's for 3 years and the many cosponsors that we \nhave for that bill. I hope that we can put together a bill that will \nnot kill the small businesses of our country, and at the same time that \nwe can help the homemakers who are contributing to the stability of our \ncountry every day and do not have the same advantages of retirement \nsecurity that those who work outside the home do. Thank you, Mr. \nPresident.\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas.\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM. Mr. President, I commend Senator Hutchison and \nSenator Mikulski for the leadership they have provided on the homemaker \nIRA's. I am pleased to have been a cosponsor, along with a number of \nothers. I think it is a very beneficial aspect of the Finance Committee \nlegislation that is before us. Senator Hutchison and Senator Mikulski \nhave fought some valiant battles to bring this to the public's \nattention, particularly to the attention of the Congress.\n  I now will yield the remaining time on the bill to the senior Senator \nfrom Missouri, Mr. Bond.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The senior Senator from Missouri is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. BOND. I thank the Chair. Might I inquire how much time is \navailable?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There are 13 minutes 35 seconds remaining.\n  Mr. BOND. I thank the Chair.\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM. Mr. President, I say to my colleague, there are a few \nminutes more of leader's time if the Senator from Missouri feels he \nneeds a few extra minutes.\n  Mr. BOND. I thank the distinguished Chair of the Labor Committee.\n  Mr. President, I rise today to talk about the provisions in my \namendment and to give some background to my colleagues on why this \namendment is important. I think by now everybody knows it would allow \nsmall businesses, the smallest of the small, grossing less than \n$500,000, the opportunity to continue to pay the minimum wage at $4.25. \nBusinesses grossing above $500,000 would begin paying $4.75 on January \n1, 1997, and $5.15 on January 1, 1998.\n  Without this provision, this would be a retroactive minimum wage \nincrease. As the Senator from Texas has already pointed out, it means \nthat businesses who have laid out their plans, issued price lists, or \nbid on contracts will find that somebody is going around and\n\n[[Page S7464]]\n\nreaching into their pockets and pulling out money that might not be \nthere. Without the delayed effective date, it is possible that small \nbusinesses or a business of any size might find themselves working \nunder existing arrangements, contracts, price lists, for a loss if we \ndo the unheard of step of imposing a retroactive minimum wage. That \nalone, I think, mandates the passage of this amendment.\n\n  In addition, we provide a training wage. A training wage is important \nnot only to get teenagers and young people into work, but to get people \ncoming off of welfare into a job, getting them started in the habits \nthat make a job a productive commitment and teach the skills that are \nneeded to hold a job.\n  The most important part of this amendment, however, is the small \nbusiness exemption. Why do we set out the exemption for the smallest of \nthe small businesses? Mr. President, as chairman of the Small Business \nCommittee, I have had the opportunity to talk with and, most \nimportantly, to listen to many small businesses around this country.\n  It is obvious to me that my colleagues, who are talking about how it \nis no problem for small businesses to have a 20-percent increase in \nwhat they pay minimum wage workers, have not been listening to the \nsmall businesses. They do not know what burdens they are under. These \npeople who are getting started, they have an idea. They are willing to \ntake a risk. They are willing to take it all on their own shoulders. \nThey may work out of their house. They put their savings into their \nideas. Most of them work far more than a 40-hour work week. They are \njust getting started--they are just getting started. If they become \nsuccessful, like a Microsoft, as soon as they hit $500,000 annual gross \nrevenue, then the minimum wage goes up to the full amount provided in \nthis bill.\n  Who does this affect? Well, Mr. President, among the people it \naffects are the National Association of Women Business Owners, NAWBO. \nThis business organization has pointed out that between 1987 and 1996 \nthe growth of women-owned firms continued to outpace the overall growth \nof business by nearly 2 to 1 and revenues generated by women-owned \nenterprises by more than triple. Almost 8 million women-owned \nbusinesses exist in the United States, and many of those, as we have \nheard in testimony before our committee, are very small businesses just \ngetting started. If they are getting started, if they are making a \nsuccess, we do not want to penalize them and their workers by imposing \non those smallest of the small businesses a burden that they cannot \nhandle.\n  These are Main Street businesses, mom and pop, and in many instances \na mom operation, working out of their garage, working out of their \nbasement, with 3 to 4 to 5 to 10 employees. This kind of increase in \nthe minimum wage is a 20-percent increase in their payroll costs for \nthose minimum wage workers. That is a real problem. That is why the \nAdministrator of the Small Business Administration under President \nClinton, Phil Lader, back on March 2, 1995, wrote to Secretary Reich, \nthe Secretary of Labor, saying, ``On balance, however, I believe that a \ntiered system''--a lower minimum wage for the smallest businesses-- \n``would serve two public policy objectives: promoting small businesses \nand preserving jobs.''\n  It is obvious that since then the ear to small business has lost out \nin this administration. Organized labor and the Secretary of \n``organized'' Labor have had their way. The Small Business \nAdministration is now saying they no longer support that. But when he \nwas speaking as a person who listens to small business, he said very \nclearly we need a two-tiered system.\n\n  President Clinton has announced, as most of you have heard, that \nexempting the smallest of the small businesses is a poison pill. I \nfrankly think that shows how little he understands how tight margins \nthese smallest of the small businesses work on. He has promised to veto \nthe legislation for that and a host of other provisions. I have to say \nthat I am very surprised and disappointed about the President's \ncharacterization because the small business exemption has traditionally \nhad broad bipartisan support in this body.\n  Special minimum wage provisions for small businesses are not a new \nconcept. The Fair Labor Standards Act has contained small business \nexemptions for well over 30 years. When the minimum wage was increased \nin 1989, Congress made several changes designed to expand small \nbusiness protections. Congress eliminated the exemption from minimum \nwage and overtime provisions for retail and service establishments \ngrossing under $362,500 and replaced it with a $500,000 threshold for \nall types of businesses.\n  Unfortunately, the 1989 amendments did not provide a true exemption. \nPeople did not realize at the time they did not provide the exemption \nand actually expanded coverage of small businesses because Congress \nfailed to amend the portion of the minimum wage provision that covered \nindividual employees. As a result, all employees engaged in commerce \nare covered by the minimum wage provision regardless of the revenue of \ntheir employers, despite the fact that this Congress, people on both \nsides of the aisle, thought they were giving the small business \nexemption.\n  I was stunned to hear Senator Kennedy call this amendment cynical, \ndevious, and shameful. What a difference an election year makes, Mr. \nPresident. It is obvious to me from reading the numerous floor \nstatements made in 1989 that Congress thought it was protecting small \nbusinesses grossing under $500,000 from the Federal minimum wage and \novertime provisions.\n  For example, Senator Kennedy explained on the Senate floor that the \nLabor Committee:\n\n     really bent over in our committee to try to consider the \n     impact of the increase of the minimum wage on small business. \n     That is why, when we initially considered the $4.65 minimum \n     wage, we increased the threshold exemption for small business \n     from $362,000 to $500,000 . . . we have been responsive, we \n     believe, to the concerns of the small business community.'\n\n  Those are Senator Kennedy's own words. I ask, was that statement \ncynical, devious, and shameful? If not, what are the statements today?\n  A number of other people have come to the floor. I saw my good friend \nfrom North Dakota speak just a few moments ago on the minimum wage. \nApril 11, 1989, he said on the floor,\n\n       The expanded enterprise test will do much to blunt the \n     effect of increasing the minimum wage on small businesses. It \n     is something the administration rightly sought, and I am glad \n     it has been included in both the committee-reported bill and \n     the compromise.\n\n  Senator Bingaman, during the 1989 minimum wage debates, on November \n7, 1989:\n\n       This legislation also includes an increase in the exemption \n     for small businesses from $362,500 to $500,000. This increase \n     helps alleviate some of the concerns expressed by small \n     businesses throughout the Nation.\n\n  Mr. President, those concerns are still there, and even more so, \nparticularly when small business found that the 1989 amendments were \nnot responsive to the concerns of small business because what was \nbilled as a change exempting more businesses, actually resulted in \nbroader coverage, since the businesses grossing under $362,500 lost \ntheir exemption.\n  Mr. President, this amendment is more modest than what Congress \nintended in 1989 because no small business with employees engaged in \ncommerce would be completely exempted from the Federal minimum wage and \novertime provisions would not be impacted.\n  My colleague from Arkansas and the ranking member of the Small \nBusiness Committee, Senator Bumpers, introduced in 1991 a bill that \nwould have corrected the problems caused by the 1989 amendments. If \nenacted, the Bumpers legislation would have provided an exemption from \nminimum wage and overtime provisions for retail and service \nestablishments grossing under $362,500. All other small businesses \ngrossing under $500,000 would have been exempted from the 1989 \nincrease. In essence, a three-tiered system, no minimum wage below \n$362,500, the existing minimum wage up to $500,000, and the increase \nabove. That bill had 48 cosponsors, 26 Republicans and 22 Democrats--\nTwelve of those Democrats are still in the Senate. I call on them to \nsupport a concept less far reaching than what they introduced and \nsponsored as a bill in 1989.\n  When Senator Bumpers introduced his bill on February 5, 1991, he \nsaid,\n\n       The clear intention was to protect the jobs of those who \n     work in the smallest companies from the backlash of a higher \n     Federal wage. However, the small business exemption has\n\n[[Page S7465]]\n\n     inadvertently been rendered useless because of a subsequent \n     conforming amendment * * *\n\n  Later on he says,\n\n       We have, without intending to do so, given small businesses \n     an exemption which is meaningless and which has added to \n     their problems.\n\n  Congressional Quarterly, doing a story on June 8, 1996, quoted \nSenator Bumpers as saying,\n\n       I've been a small businessman with less than $500,000 in \n     sales and I know this thing could be pretty detrimental.\n\n  Senator Kerrey, reacting to a statement that Democrats in the House \nsaid the proposal would lead to the creation of a new class of \nexploited workers said, ``If they were good Democrats, they were,'' \nreferring to demagoging the issue.\n  Senator Pryor, on February 5, speaking in support of the Bumpers bill \nsaid,\n\n       While these rates--talking then of a minimum wage increase \n     from $3.80 to $4.25--While these rates may not seem high, to \n     a mom and pop enterprise operating on a razor thin profit \n     margin, it could be the final wave that takes them under.\n\n  This seemingly innocuous omission in wording has in effect precluded \nalmost all small businesses from qualifying for the exemption Congress \nobviously intended. If any of my colleagues have any doubt about \ncongressional intent, all they have to do is go back and read the \nRecord during the debate. Both proponents and opponents laud the small \nbusiness exemption.\n  Now, Mr. President, my amendment does not go as far as the proposal \nmade by Senator Bumpers in 1991. Unlike the Bumpers amendment, there is \nno complete exemption from any business from the Federal minimum wage. \nThe amendment does not affect the FLSA overtime provisions. The \namendment simply maintains the status quo for America's small business \nby allowing them to continue to pay $4.25.\n  Mr. President, I see I am probably approaching the end of my time, \nand I ask for 5 minutes of the leader's time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, what we have today is an opportunity to \ncorrect this mistake made in 1989 by enacting legislation that reflects \nboth Congress intent in 1989 and the Bumpers legislation that had such \nbroad bipartisan support in 1991. This amendment does not go as far as \nwhat was intended in 1989 by a Democrat Congress and a Republican \nPresident and supported in 1991 by a bipartisan group of Senators. \nTwelve of the twenty-two Democrats who cosponsored Senator Bumpers' \nbill in 1991 are still in the Senate. I call on them today to maintain \ntheir earlier position so we can pass this amendment that is so \nimportant to America's small business.\n  Let me focus just a minute on a couple of things that had been stated \nin the media that this amendment does and does not do. Some statements \nhave been made that the amendment provides a complete exemption from \nany minimum wage. I have stated that is simply not true. For those \nexempted, it keeps the minimum wage at $4.25.\n  President Clinton talked about the amendment causing employees of \nsmall businesses to be ineligible for an increase in their wages and \nlocked in to the current minimum wage. Who do we think provides wages \nin this country? Is it Congress in its largess? No; it is the people \nwho have committed their time, resources, energy, and their capital to \nproviding the best jobs they can and the products and services that the \nmarketplace will take. Anybody who understands a market economy knows \nthat everyone in America is eligible for a raise.\n  The minimum wage is a floor, not a ceiling, and nothing in our \ncapital system or nothing in my amendment sets an upper limit on how \nmuch a worker can earn. The purpose of the small business amendment is, \nin fact, to make sure that America's workers continue to have the \nopportunity to enter into the small business work force and earn raises \nin the future.\n  I also ought to address the statements that have been made on this \nfloor totally, I think, without justification, that some 10.5 million \nworkers would be covered by this minimum wage exemption. That simply is \nout of whole cloth. There are 10.5 million workers who are employed by \nbusinesses grossing under $500,000, but this amendment does not affect \nnearly that many. There are 11 States that have higher minimum wages. \nThose workers would not be affected. It takes it down to 8.8 \nmillion. How many of those actually work at minimum wage? We do not \nhave the accurate figures, but the Small Business Administration's \nadvocacy counsel said approximately 10 percent of the workers in small \nbusiness earn the minimum wage. So we are talking roughly 10 percent of \n8 million to 9 million people, or 800,000 to 900,000 people.\n\n  Phil Lader, the Administrator of the SBA, agrees with me--has agreed \nwith me in the past before he got his arms twisted--that the small \nbusiness exemption is a good policy because it impacts a small number \nof employees while ensuring that firms at the margin will not be forced \nto cut jobs or not grow. In the letter I cited earlier from Mr. Lader \nto the Secretary of Labor, he said, ``an exemption for the smallest of \nsmall businesses makes sense.'' Mr. Lader went on to state that:\n\n       An exemption allowing the minimum wage to stay at its \n     present level for firms would be a way of crediting the \n     smallest employers for costs they incur: (1) by employing \n     young workers in their first jobs; (2) by providing general \n     skills training to workers; (3) by hiring a large fraction of \n     part time, seasonal and contingent workers, and (4) by \n     bearing the cost of turnover associated with minimum wage \n     jobs.\n\n  Mr. Lader also pointed out that:\n\n       By maintaining the status quo, the smallest of small \n     businesses will be able to continue to provide jobs to the \n     marginally employable, an important public policy goal during \n     a time of near-full employment.\n\n  Mr. Lader concludes by saying he believes that:\n\n     rather than penalize workers in small firms, maintaining the \n     present minimum wage would enable these small employers to \n     sustain present employment levels without imposing the need \n     to make difficult choices to preserve profitability.\n\n  I agree with that position. I think that comes from a good \nunderstanding of what small businesses have been saying. I am sorry \nthat he has not been able to maintain that position because the policy \nof the White House has changed.\n  If you listen to small businesses, as members of the Small Business \nCommittee have, as I have done, and as the Small Business \nAdministration has done, you will know that small businesses, while \nthey have difficult battles in the marketplace, fear nothing more than \nthe heavy hand of the Federal Government--in this case the mom and pop \nor the mom operation with 5 and 10 employees getting a 20-percent \nincrease in minimum wage mandated by the Federal Government which could \nforce them to lay off 20 percent of their workers. That is one out of \nfive, two out of 10, four out of 20.\n  People have called this cruel to say they can be exempt. Mr. \nPresident, I think it is far crueler to throw these people out of work \nby saying to small business that we cannot allow you to continue to pay \n$4.25 an hour and make a profit on the business that you have \nundertaken.\n  Small businesses under 500,000 deserve an exemption. On a bipartisan \nbasis Congress in the past thought they were giving them that \nexemption. It is time to make good on the promises made by the \nstatements from our distinguished colleagues on the other side of the \naisle, as well as this body.\n  Mr. Lader and I both believe that an exemption for the smallest of \nsmall businesses makes sense because it saves jobs. Unlike a \ncorporation that can pass increased labor costs on to the consumer, the \nsmall, local grocery store or florist or hardware store doesn't have \nthat option and the owner is who is dealing with a 5-percent profit \nmargin is not taking home much money himself.\n  Mr. Lader's point about providing jobs to the marginally employable \nis even more important today than it was 1-year ago when the letter was \nwritten. The Department of Labor just announced that unemployment is at \na 6-year low. As Federal and State governments try to maintain this \nlevel of employment and struggle to reform our present welfare system, \nit is vital that we be able to rely on small businesses to continue to \nprovide jobs. I think that we should take Mr. Lader's advice and allow \nthese small businesses to remain at the current minimum wage so that \ntwo important public policy goals Mr. Lader mentions--promoting small \nbusinesses and preserving jobs--can be met.\n\n[[Page S7466]]\n\n  My amendment also contains several provisions that have already \npassed the House. The first two provisions were noncontroversial on the \nHouse sides and I believe that the same will hold true on this side. \nFirst, the amendment clarifies that employees do not have to be paid \nfor time spent driving to and from work in company vehicles. Second, \nthe overtime exemption for computer professionals making over $27.63 \nper hour is maintained.\n  My amendment also contains the same tip credit provision that passed \nthe House. Tipped employees would continue to be paid at least $2.13 \nper hour by their employers and would also earn tips. If the cash wage \nof $2.13 and the tips did not add up to the Federal minimum wage, then \nthe employer would make up the difference. Thus, tipped employees, like \nall other employees, would earn at least the Federal minimum wage.\n  My amendment contains an opportunity wage that would allow employers \nto pay first-time employees $4.25 for 180 consecutive days. This \nprovision is designed to get unskilled people into the job market where \nthey can develop the good work habits that make advancement possible. \nMy amendment expands on the 90-day time period in the House bill \nbecause employers are more likely to hire unskilled workers that they \nhave sufficient time to train. Unlike the House provision, my amendment \ndoes not include an age limit because unskilled workers of all ages \nmuch be permitted to enter the work force more easily.\n  As my distinguished colleague, Senator Chafee, pointed out on the \nfloor recently, Senators from both sides of the aisle are demanding \nthat people get off of welfare and work and we must provide some \nincentive to employers for hiring unskilled workers. These people will \nbe working at this first jobs and will be provided with the skills they \nneed to advance and earn more.\n  Mr. Kennedy said recently that the ``downsized, laid-off workers in a \ntime of high unemployment'' will be hurt the most by the opportunity \nwage. I would point again to the figures released recently by the \nDepartment of Labor that show that unemployment has fallen to 5.3 \npercent, the lowest level in 6 years, and that wages are up to $11.82 \nper hour on average. President Clinton hailed the numbers as showing \nthat ``wages for American workers are finally on the rise again. These \nfigures indicate that the laid-off steelworker and the officeworker \nwith 30 years of experience that Senator Kennedy spoke of are not going \nto be earning the opportunity wage. Instead, the opportunity wage is \ngoing to allow access to the job market for unskilled workers with \nlittle or no job experience, workers who otherwise would not have been \nhired at all.\n  My amendment delays the implementation of the minimum wage increase \nuntil January 1, 1997. This delay will help small businesses adjust and \nminimize job loss. This is particularly true for small retailers that \nhire more workers during the holiday season. A delay is also important \nfor employers that have committed to hiring teenagers for summer jobs. \nAs Federal funding for summer youth job programs dries up, we must \nsupport private efforts.\n  America's small businesses have been extremely successful and have \ncreated the vast majority of new jobs in the last decade. If we want \nthis level of growth to continue, and if we want to give America's \nworkers the opportunity to get in on the ground floor of some of \ntoday's most profitable businesses, we must protect these businesses \nfrom Federal mandates. I urge you to support my amendment so that the \nopportunities available in America's small businesses continue grow.\n\n\n                      UNANIMOUS-CONSENT AGREEMENT\n\n  Mr. BOND.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to use just 2 \nminutes of my leader time prior to the vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, we are about to cast some very important \nvotes this afternoon. I believe it is fair to say the American people \nare going to be watching very carefully. These are the ones they \nunderstand all too well. Many have not had a raise in 5 years. They \nhave not seen an increase in the minimum wage more than once in the \nlast 15. Many of them now have lost ground.\n  The question before us is very simple: Should 13 million Americans \nget a raise? It should not matter where you work or how long you have \nbeen working. Anyone who works 40 hours a week should not have to live \nin poverty.\n  We have all made our speeches as passionately as we know how about \nthe need to improve our welfare system. There is no better way to get \npeople off welfare than to give them a job that pays something beyond a \nminimum wage, so that they are not relegated to poverty for the rest of \ntheir lives. We have all talked about how pro-family we are. Nothing \ncould be more profamily than to ensure parents have a working wage, \nthat instead of working two or three jobs, they can work one and tend \nto their children at those times when otherwise they would have to \nwork.\n  So the choice is very clear. Either we vote for this increase or \nsentence millions of workers to even more poverty and family troubles \nthan they are experiencing right now.\n  No one should be confused about the amendments. The Bond amendment \nguts the minimum wage bill. As the National Retail Federation said, \nthis is the best chance to defeat the minimum wage bill. The Kennedy \namendment will strengthen it.\n  We have a chance to do something positive today. We should do it in a \nbipartisan way. We have done it before and passed votes on the minimum \nwage in this Chamber. The House of Representatives did it just 6 weeks \nago. We can do it, too, this afternoon. Let us vote to give millions of \nAmericans the raise they deserve.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. ROTH addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the majority leader \nis recognized.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I yield 2 minutes to the distinguished \nchairman of the Finance Committee.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n\n\n                   Modification of Amendment No. 4436\n\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I send to the desk a modification to the \nmanagers' amendment that has been cleared by the two managers and the \ntwo leaders.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator has the \nright to modify the underlying amendment.\n  The modification is as follows:\n\n       On page 26, between lines 6 and 7, insert:\n\n     SEC. 1467. TREATMENT OF MULTIEMPLOYER PLANS UNDER SECTION \n                   415.\n\n       (a) Compensation Limit.--Paragraph (11) of section 415(b), \n     as added by section 1444(a), is amended--\n       (1) by inserting ``or a multiemployer plan (as defined in \n     section 414(f)'' after ``section 414(d))'', and\n       (2) by inserting ``and multiemployer'' after \n     ``governmental'' in the heading thereof.\n       (b) Exemption for Survivor and Disability Benefits.--\n     Subparagraph (I) of section\n\n[[Page S7467]]\n\n     415(b)(2), as added by section 1444(c), is amended--\n       (1) by inserting ``or a multiemployer plan (as defined in \n     section 414(f))'' after ``section 414(d))'' in clause (i) \n     thereof,\n       (2) by inserting ``or multiemployer'' after \n     ``governmental'' in clause (ii) thereof, and\n       (3) by inserting ``and multiemployer'' after \n     ``governmental'' in the heading thereof.\n       (c) Effective Date.--The amendments made by this section \n     shall apply to years beginning after December 31, 1996.\n\n     SEC. 1468. PAYMENT OF LUMP-SUM CREDIT FOR FORMER SPOUSES OF \n                   FEDERAL EMPLOYEES.\n\n       (a) In General.--Title 5, United States Code, is amended--\n       (1) in section 8342(c) by striking ``Lump-sum'' and \n     inserting ``Except as provided in section 8345(j), lump-\n     sum'';\n       (2) in section 8345(j)--\n       (A) in paragraph (1) by inserting after ``that individual'' \n     the following: ``, or be made under section 8342 (d) through \n     (f) to an individual entitled under section 8342(c),''; and\n       (B) by adding at the end the following:\n       ``(4) Any payment under this subsection to a person bars \n     recovery by any other person.'';\n       (3) in section 8424(d) by striking ``Lump-sum'' and \n     inserting ``Except as provided in section 8467(a), lump-\n     sum''; and\n       (4) in section 8467--\n       (A) in subsection (a) by inserting after ``that \n     individual'' the following: ``, or be made under section 8424 \n     (e) through (g) to an individual entitled under section \n     8424(d),''; and\n       (B) by adding at the end the following:\n       ``(d) Any payment under this section to a person bars \n     recovery by any other person.''.\n       (b) Effective Date.--The amendments made by this section \n     shall apply with respect to any death occurring after the \n     90th day after the date of the enactment of this Act.\n       On page 26, line 7, strike ``1467'' and insert ``1469''.\n\n  Mr. ROTH. This modification includes two provisions. First, \nmultiemployer pension plans are exempted from the Tax Code pension \nbenefit limits and, second, employee contributions to the Federal \nGovernment retirement funds would be subject to the judgment of a \ndivorce court in the same way annuity and survivor benefits are subject \nto such orders.\n  I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. LOTT addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, it has taken a long time for the Senate to \nfinally come to the point where we are today. It has been delayed for \nweeks--actually, I guess, months--so I do wish to thank the \ndistinguished Democratic leader for his cooperation in setting up this \nprocess that we begin voting on today.\n  I also especially thank the chairman of the Finance Committee and the \nranking member of the Finance Committee. They did a very good job in \nthe committee on the small business relief package. It was passed \nunanimously, I believe. We now have a leaders'-managers' amendment that \nwill further improve it, and I think that is a very significant part of \nthis legislation. I commend them for the work they have done.\n  I remind my colleagues today that we need to remember that small \nbusinesses play a crucial, in fact, probably the most important, role \nin the creation of new jobs in this country. More than 75 percent of \nall new employment opportunities in America occur in small businesses. \nThey account for over 50 percent of all sales and produce 55 percent of \nour gross domestic product.\n  In that context, I have always been reluctant to vote for any measure \nwhich would restrict the formation and expansion of small business.\n  It is all too easy for Congress to promise benefits--like the \nincrease of minimum wage--and to look the other way when our \nlegislative mandate destroys jobs instead of creating them, and \nprevents willing workers from climbing up the opportunity ladder.\n  That is why I strongly support what was reported out of the Finance \nCommittee with this small business tax relief, and why I also support \nvery aggressively the amendment offered by Senator Bond. If we are \ngoing to impose a higher minimum wage and thereby limit job creation \nand economic opportunity, the least we can do is to offer some support, \nsome buffer for small businesses to be protected from the worst effects \nof our good intentions.\n  So the Bond amendment is the responsible thing to do. It is a modest \namendment, despite all the rhetoric directed against it. It would \nexempt from the higher minimum wage those small businesses which gross \nless than $500,000 a year.\n  I believe this has had bipartisan support in the past. In fact, \nPresident Clinton's own Administrator of the Small Business \nAdministration endorsed this concept as recently as 1995. And not so \nlong ago, Senator Bumpers proposed an even broader exemption that had \nthe support of 12 Democratic Senators who still serve here today. The \nBond amendment also has a training wage. If we do not have a training \nwage for entry level people, First, they may not get a job or, second, \nif they have a job they run the risk of losing it. There is something \nworse than low wages and that is no wages. This helps to address that, \nproviding entry-level training wage assistance.\n  There are several other very good features in this legislation for \nsmall businesses, though, beyond the Bond amendment. It increases to \n$25,000 the amount small businesses can write off for their purchase of \nequipment. It makes important changes to the tax rules concerning \nindependent contractors, to reduce IRS harassment of those workers and \nof the businesses that contract for their services. It also extends \nseveral important tax provisions that have expired, including the \nexclusion from income for employer-provided educational assistance and \nthe tax credit for research and development expenses.\n  The bill and the managers' amendment contain pension simplification \nmeasures that will expand pension coverage and eliminate much of the \nred-tape that often deters employers from offering pension plans. The \nbill creates a new form of pension plan for small businesses, rightly \ncalled the SIMPLE Act, crafted to address the concerns of the men and \nwomen in the small businesses all across this country.\n  Equally important, finally, after talking about it for years, we are \ngoing to allow a full IRA deduction for the spousal IRA. The spouse who \nworks inside the home now can only deduct $200 for her IRA instead of \nthe regular $2,000. We should absolutely do this. At long last, the \nspouses would be treated the same as others.\n  There are other good provisions in this legislation. I endorse \nparticularly the small business relief package. I urge my colleagues to \nsupport that. I urge my colleagues to vote against the Kennedy \namendment.\n  There is a minimum wage increase in the Bond amendment, and the basic \npackage, which is the House-passed package, has the minimum wage \nincrease in it. When you couple that minimum wage increase with these \nsmall business tax reliefs and the small business exemption, then you \nhave a package that really provides increased wages and protection from \njob loss. I urge my colleagues to vote for the Bond amendment, against \nthe Kennedy amendment, and I yield the floor.\n\n\n                       Vote on Amendment No. 4272\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senate will now \nvote on the Bond amendment, No. 4272. The yeas and nays have not been \nordered.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN.

Mr. President, first of all, I want to express my \nappreciation to\n\n[[Page S7469]]\n\nthe distinguished senior Senator from New York for contributions he has \nmade in bringing this tax legislation to a successful conclusion. I can \nsay in all honesty, it would not have happened without his wise \ncounsel, his advice and willingness to work across the aisle. I greatly \nappreciate it.\n  I also wish to express my appreciation to the many staff people who \nworked so hard to bring this legislation to the Senate floor. While \nmany of us were back home, perhaps working hard there in local offices, \nor celebrating our Nation's birthday, we had many, many staff members \nfrom Senator Moynihan's office, the staff of the two leaders, as well \nas mine, dedicating long hours to trying to bring this legislation that \nwe have just voted on to conclusion.\n  I would like to especially mention Lindy Paull, Frank Polk, Mark \nPrater, Rosemary Becchi, Sam Olchyk, Doug Fisher, Lori Peterson, Brig \nGulya, Tom Roesser, as well as Mark Patterson, Jon Talisman, Patti \nMcClanahan, and Maury Passman for their excellent work.\n  For the managers' amendment, I would like to express my thanks to \nAnnette Guarisco and Susan Connell, of Senator Lott's office.\n  From Senator Daschle's office: Larry Stein, Alexandra Deane Thorton, \nGlenn Ivey, Leslie Kramerich.\n  Again, I thank Senator Moynihan and his very excellent staff for \ntheir help and cooperation.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I rise to reciprocate and thank Mark \nPatterson and making a doubly reference to Lindy Paull.\n  This was the first major tax bill that our distinguished chairman has \nreported out of his committee and to the floor. I think it is a tribute \nto the way he has handled this matter, and it reflects his career in \nthe Senate, that the bill passed by a 3-to-1 margin, 74 to 24. There \nwill be no discussion of vetoes anywhere else in town. We will now \nappoint conferees.\n  I would like to say from our side that we look to the leadership of \nthe chairman in conference. I am sure we will insist on our measures, \nand I expect to come back wholly pleased and honored by the association \nand more than pleased with the outcome.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, the vote earlier on the minimum wage was \na resounding victory for the minimum wage, and a convincing repudiation \nof a cynical attempt to kill the bill. The Senate rose to the occasion \nto have the minimum wage. President Clinton can sign this bill with \npride.\n  Enough is enough is enough. It has been a long time since Congress \nacted to make the minimum wage a living wage. Along with Social \nSecurity and Medicare, the minimum wage is one of the three most \nsuccessful social programs ever enacted. In this context we have \nprotected Social Security, we have protected Medicare, and today we are \nprotecting the minimum wage.\n  Today's vote means that millions of Americans will soon receive the \nlong overdue increase they deserve in the minimum wage. Today's vote \nmeans that a solid majority of the Senate has kept the faith with the \nfundamental principle of the minimum wage. No one who works for a \nliving should have to live in poverty.\n  Today's vote means that minimum wage workers are no longer the \ninvisible Americans. We see them every day--the child care workers who \ncare for children, the health care aides who care for patients in \nhospitals, and senior citizens in nursing homes, teachers' aides who \nlabor in the classroom to educate their pupils, and the millions of \nother Americans who work hard days and long hours to make America work. \nTheir work is indispensable to our country. And today the Senate gave \nthem a helping hand.\n  The minimum wage has not gone up in 5 years. We all know that the gap \nbetween the rich and poor is widening in America. The economy may be \ndoing well. But the benefits are flowing primarily to those at the top.\n  Corporate downsizing and layoffs may not affect the wealthy, but the \nvast majority of Americans are being left out and left behind, and \nthose at the bottom of the ladder are being left farther behind.\n  They need our help, and today they received it.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/07/09/senate-section/article/S7466-2", "month": "07", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "09", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7469-S7489]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               TEAMWORK FOR EMPLOYEES AND MANAGEMENT ACT\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senate will now \nproceed to the consideration of S. 295, which the clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 295) to permit labor management cooperative \n     efforts that improve America's economic competitiveness to \n     continue to thrive, and for other purposes.\n\n  The Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate is now considering S. 295. Who \nyields time?\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The senior Senator from Kansas is recognized.\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM. Mr. President, I am going to speak for a moment about \nthe full bill, the Teamwork for Employees and Management Act, which has \nbeen called the TEAM Act, and why I think this is an important piece of \nlegislation.\n  It is important because it improves the quality of life for workers \non the job as well as the quality and productivity of American firms \ncompeting in the global marketplace. We are in a new era, Mr. \nPresident, and because of global competition I think we need to look at \nnew and innovative ways in which we can encourage a cooperative spirit \nin the workplace. This is why I think this legislation is important and \nwhy I hope my colleagues will support this with a strong vote.\n  The Senate has already spent a considerable period of time debating \nthe TEAM Act. As I stated earlier in that debate, it responds to a \nseries of decisions by the National Labor Relations Board that cast \ndoubt on the legality of employee involvement programs, particularly in \nnonunion settings.\n  For instance, just last December, the board invalidated an employee \ninvolvement program in my own State of Kansas. A committee of workers \nand managers at Dillon's stores in Wichita, Newton, and Wellington, KS, \nmet quarterly to discuss workplace issues and minutes of the meetings \nwere then distributed to all employees. Employee representatives served \nvoluntarily on the committee for 1-year terms and were elected by \nsecret ballot.\n  Over the course of 7 years, the committee discussed such issues as \nwhether the company would begin providing day care services for \nworkers; whether Dillon's stores would begin providing a gym for \nworkers to exercise in; whether better lifting equipment could be used \nfor stocking shelves; whether the no-smoking lounge could be better \nmaintained and a total no-smoking policy be implemented; and whether \nsafety goggles could be provided for bakery employees.\n  These commonsense suggestions, Mr. President, are precisely the type \nof contributions that we need to promote. It is the type of discussions \nregarding the environment that both employees and employers are \ninvolved in that I think just make good sense for us today. There is \nnothing devious about this. This is not an attempt to try to diminish \nthe unions. These are, however, issues that are of importance to every \nemployee, and they are issues which the employers should care about as \nwell.\n  Supervisors might not be focused on day care or new ways to stock \nshelves or the need for safety goggles, but these are the issues of \nconcern for workers. Regrettably, the National Labor Relations Board \nsaid that discussing these issues in worker management committees \nviolated Federal labor law.\n  Mr. President, I continue to be surprised by the level of opposition \nthat some Members of the Senate express toward employee involvement. \nQuite simply, the TEAM Act removes the barriers in Federal labor law \nthat prevent workers and supervisors from meeting in committees to \ndiscuss workplace issues.\n  I thought I might take a moment just to read the language of the TEAM \nAct, since I think it is very straightforward. The bill states that it \nshall not be illegal for an employer:\n\n       * * * to establish, assist, maintain or participate in any \n     organization or entity of any kind, in which employees \n     participate to address matters of mutual interest (including\n\n[[Page S7470]]\n\n     issues of quality, productivity and efficiency) and which \n     does not have, claim or seek authority to negotiate or enter \n     into collective bargaining agreements under this Act with the \n     employer or to amend existing collective bargaining \n     agreements between the employer and any labor organization.\n\n  This language is clear. It says that Federal labor law will not \nprevent supervisors and workers from discussing matters of mutual \ninterest. I do not think we need to fear these type of discussions in \nthe workplace. If so, we have already created a hostile environment--\none that is full of dissension, potentially, among employees and \nbetween employees and employers.\n\n  Some opponents of the TEAM Act suggest that workers will be exploited \nif the TEAM Act becomes law. But I fail to see why these discussions \nabout workplace issues exploit workers.\n  The law seems to be clear that employers in nonunion companies \nunilaterally can address workplace issues. For instance, in the \nDillon's stores that I mentioned a few moments ago, the company could \ndecide on its own to provide safety goggles, to begin day care or to \nexpand a no-smoking policy, but the management probably did not know \nthese issues were important for workers.\n  That is not to say employers should not have known that these issues \nwere important, but as we have seen all too often over the years there \nis a lack of communication that many of us think often takes place \nbetween employers and employees. This legislation is simply designed to \nencourage communication, and to make sure that there is an \nunderstanding that they will not be in violation of the National Labor \nRelations Act.\n  Under the TEAM Act, workers retain the right at any time to select a \nunion to represent them, and firms must recognize and bargain with the \nunion once workers choose that representation. The TEAM Act is clear \nthat employee teams may not ``have, claim or seek authority to \nnegotiate or enter into collective bargaining agreements.''\n  This legislation is not a camel's nose under the tent. This is not an \neffort to have a sham type of union. All these have been accusations \nthat have been made that clearly are not true nor were ever the aim of \nthis legislation.\n  In the 1930's, employers did create company unions to compete with \nindependent unions that workers chose. The employer would then refuse \nto bargain with the independent union in favor of the company union.\n  Significantly, this practice would be patently illegal under the TEAM \nAct. Once the workers seek the union the employer must recognize the \nunion as the employee representative. Employers may not use teams to \nbypass an independent union.\n  I have an amendment to be offered later that will make crystal clear \nthat the TEAM Act does not apply once workers have selected union \nrepresentation.\n  I have an additional point that I would like to make regarding \nemployee exploitation. During our hearings in the Labor Committee, we \nheard from workers who participate in employee teams. I think that all \nthe Senators who heard the Labor and Human Resources Committee hearings \nwere impressed with the workers. They are the ones who enjoy teamwork. \nThey are the ones whose ideas are implemented. They are also the ones \nwhose economic future is at stake.\n  As Ms. Molly Dalman, a team member from Donnelly Corp. in Michigan \ntestified:\n\n       Our goal is to keep each other informed, to produce a high-\n     quality product in the most efficient manner. This helps us \n     to be competitive in the market * * *. I know my job, what I \n     need to do, and how to do it, better than my team leader or \n     any engineer. Therefore, I need to feel as if I have some \n     control in my work area, and by working in teams, I have that \n     control.\n\n  This is part of the hearing record. It exemplifies what many workers \nhave said to us regarding their relationship in the workplace and why \nthey believe this legislation would benefit them.\n  She concluded:\n\n       I cannot imagine how any company could function without the \n     active participation and support of all employees from all \n     areas working together. Teamwork promotes a better working \n     environment [and] a better company. I cannot envision [my \n     company] without the support of its teams.\n\n  Another team member testified that her team dealt with multiskill \nwork design, quality, training, rotation, and overtime guidelines. Not \nonly was the ``product line much better equipped,'' she said, ``to \nrespond quickly to a fast-paced, very sophisticated market,'' but she \npersonally felt a greater degree of job satisfaction and ``just a sense \nof ownership.''\n  I think, Mr. President, that her comments exemplify what I feel. This \nis an important bill--it is one that should not be in any way viewed as \nsomething nefarious, something that we are trying to do to undermine \nthe unions. It is designed to address the workplace as it exists today \nand give the employees a sense of being involved.\n  These workers are not being exploited. Instead, the TEAM Act gives \nworkers the tools they need today, to do an ever better job. We need to \nharness our human resources, not to silence them.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum and \nthat the time be equally divided.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, my understanding is that the unanimous \nconsent agreement allows for the introduction of an amendment with a 1-\nhour team agreement, 30 minutes on each side, on behalf of the minority \nleader or his designee.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4437\n\n            (Purpose: To provide for a substitute amendment)\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I call up an amendment under that \nunanimous consent request and ask that it be reported.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from North Dakota [Mr. Dorgan] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 4437.\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that further \nreading of the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Teamwork for Employees and \n     Management Act of 1995''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       (1) the escalating demands of global competition have \n     compelled an increasing number of American employers to make \n     dramatic changes in workplace and employer-employee \n     relationships;\n       (2) these changes involve an enhanced role for the employee \n     in workplace decisionmaking, often referred to as ``employee \n     involvement'', which has taken many forms, including self-\n     managed work teams, quality-of-worklife, quality circles, and \n     joint labor-management committees;\n       (3) employee involvement structures, which operate \n     successfully in both unionized and non-unionized settings, \n     have been established by over 80 percent of the largest \n     employers of the United States and exist in an estimated \n     30,000 workplaces;\n       (4) in addition to enhancing the productivity and \n     competitiveness of American businesses, employee involvement \n     structures have had a positive impact on the lives of those \n     employees, better enabling them to reach their potential in \n     their working lives;\n       (5) recognizing that foreign competitors have successfully \n     utilized employee involvement techniques, Congress has \n     consistently joined business, labor, and academic leaders in \n     encouraging and recognizing successful employee involvement \n     structures in the workplace through such incentives as the \n     Malcolm Baldrige National Quality Award;\n       (6) employers who have instituted legitimate employee \n     involvement structures have not done so to interfere with the \n     collective bargaining rights guaranteed by the labor laws, as \n     was the case in the 1930s when employers established \n     deceptive sham ``company unions'' to avoid unionization; and\n       (7) the prohibition of the National Labor Relations Act \n     against employer domination or interference with the \n     formation or administration of a labor organization has \n     produced uncertainty and apprehension among employers \n     regarding the continued development of employee involvement \n     structures.\n       (b) Purposes.--It is the purpose of this Act to--\n       (1) protect legitimate employee involvement structures \n     against governmental interference;\n       (2) preserve existing protections against deceptive, \n     coercive employer practices; and\n\n[[Page S7471]]\n\n       (3) permit legitimate employee involvement structures where \n     workers may discuss issues involving terms and conditions of \n     employment, to continue to evolve and proliferate.\n\n     SEC. 3. LABOR PRACTICES.\n\n       Section 8 of the National Labor Relations Act (29 U.S.C. \n     158) is amended by adding at the end thereof the following \n     new subsection:\n       ``(h)(1) The following provisions shall apply with respect \n     to any employees who are not represented by an exclusive \n     representative pursuant to section 9(a) or 8(f):\n       ``(A) It shall not constitute or be evidence of an unfair \n     labor practice under section 8(a)(2) for an employer to meet \n     with the employees as a group, or to meet with each of the \n     employees individually, to share information, to brainstorm, \n     or receive suggestions or opinions from individual employees, \n     with respect to matters of mutual interest, including matters \n     relating to working conditions.\n       ``(B) It shall not constitute or be evidence of an unfair \n     labor practice under section 8(a)(2) for an employer to \n     assign employees to work units and to hold regular meetings \n     of the employees assigned to a work unit to discuss matters \n     relating to the work responsibilities of the unit. The \n     meetings may, on occasion, include discussions with respect \n     to the conditions of work of the employees assigned to the \n     unit.\n       ``(C) It shall not constitute or be evidence of an unfair \n     labor practice under section 8(a)(2) for an employer to \n     establish a committee composed of employees of the employer \n     to make recommendations or determinations on ways of \n     improving the quality of, or method of producing and \n     distributing, the employer's product or service and to hold \n     regular meetings of the committee to discuss matters relating \n     to the committee. The meetings may, on occasion, include \n     discussions with respect to any directly related issues \n     concerning conditions of work of the employees.\n       ``(2) The provisions of paragraph (1) shall not apply if--\n       ``(A) a labor organization is the representative of the \n     employees as provided in section 9(a);\n       ``(B) the employer creates or alters the work unit or \n     committee during any organizational activity among the \n     employer's employees or discourages employees from exercising \n     the rights of the employees under section 7;\n       ``(C) the employer interferes with, restrains, or coerces \n     any employee because of the employee's participation in or \n     refusal to participate in discussions with respect to \n     conditions of work, which otherwise would be permitted by \n     subparagraphs (A) through (C) of paragraph (1); or\n       ``(D) an employer establishes or maintains a group, unit, \n     or committee authorized by subparagraph (A), (B), or (C) of \n     paragraph (1) that discusses conditions of work of employees \n     who are represented under section 9 without first engaging in \n     the collective bargaining required by this Act.\n       ``(3) An employee who participates in a group, unit, or \n     committee described in subparagraph (A), (B), or (C) of \n     paragraph (1) shall not be considered to be a supervisor or \n     manager because of the participation of the employee in the \n     group, unit, or committee.''.\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, we are now discussing something called the \nTEAM Act, which to a lot of Americans will not mean very much. It is an \nacronym that talks about teamwork.\n  We have gone through a kind of interesting and difficult time in our \ncountry in recent years. We have seen a transition to a global economy, \na period during which it has been, at least for some companies, \ndifficult to deal with new rules of competition. These companies have \nhad to deal with global competition, have had to experience the reality \nof competing with companies that produce elsewhere in the world and \nwhich have production facilities that are not required to meet the same \nrules or the same obligations as we are required to meet in this \ncountry.\n  They do not always have to worry about child labor laws. They do not \nhave to worry so much about antipollution concerns, do not have to \nworry about things like minimum wages. The result has been that \nAmerican enterprises find themselves competing with, in many cases, \nenterprises in other parts of the world that hire 12-year-old kids and \npay them 24 cents an hour, throw chemicals into the water, pollution \ninto the air, and produce a product and ship it to Pittsburgh or ship \nit to Denver or Bismarck or Topeka and sell it and compete against \nlocal businesses while they do that.\n  This has been an increasingly challenging time for American \nbusinesses. There are those who say--and I believe they are correct, \nespecially the new breed of American entrepreneur--that the only way \nthat we can meet this difficult international competition and do so \nsuccessfully and do so in a way that allows us to win in international \neconomic competition, is if we have more teamwork and if we have more \ncooperation between those who run American businesses and those who \nwork for those businesses. I have no disagreement about that at all.\n  I think we have a requirement in this country, with the new global \neconomy, to have educated, dedicated, motivated workers who come to the \nworkplace and say, we want to be part of a team, we want to succeed, we \nwant to produce good products and sell them at a good price and earn \ngood wages, and we want the company to earn good money.\n  That is part of what this is all about. There is not a disagreement \non the floor of the Senate about the value of teamwork. The \ndisagreement exists about precisely how we would change the law to \naccommodate these concerns.\n  Most companies in this country already have work units, teams, \nemployee groups that are established to talk about what those companies \nare doing, what their goals are, what their day is like, how to be more \nefficient. Most of the largest employers in America already have, in \nboth unionized and nonunionized settings, employee involvement \nstructures of one kind or another. That exists in some 30,000 \nworkplaces in this country.\n  So it is not a case where this does not already exist. In fact, if \nyou take a look at some of the case studies of some of the very \nsuccessful companies in our country, you will see that they have \nestablished workplace teams in a very successful way. They have \ninvolved employees in helping make some of the decisions on how to \nproduce most effectively and efficiently. So there is not going to be a \ndisagreement on the floor of the Senate about whether teamwork is \nvaluable. Of course it is.\n  The findings and purposes to the amendment that I have offered to the \nlegislation being considered on the floor talks about the escalating \ndemands of global competition. It requires an increasing number of \nemployers to make changes in the workplace and changes in employee-\nemployer relationships. I talk about the changes that involve an \nenhanced role for the employee in workplace decisionmaking. It is often \nreferred to as employee involvement, which has taken a lot of different \nforms including self-managed work teams, quality of work teams, quality \ncircles, joint labor-management committees, and many more. It is being \ndone all across this country.\n\n  In addition to enhancing the productivity and the competitiveness of \nAmerican businesses, these kinds of structures have had a positive \nimpact on the lives of many employees, better enabling them to reach \ntheir potential as employees. I also point out that foreign competitors \nhave successfully utilized employee involvement techniques. Congress \nhas encouraged the same thing, as well.\n  However, having said all that, and wanting to encourage teamwork, let \nme emphasize that we want to encourage teamwork in the right way. We do \nnot want someone to come to the floor of the Senate, or some group to \ncome to the floor of the Senate and address a problem in a manner that \ncauses more problems and more difficulties. That is what we fear the \nunderlying bill does.\n  The amendment I am offering is very straightforward. There are some \nwho say, and I think they are correct, that NLRB decisions have created \nuncertainty about the conditions under which certain employee \ninvolvement teams or organizations can be permitted or will be \npermitted, uncertainty about where the lines are and about what \nemployers can do. To the extent that is correct, and I believe it is, \nthere is that uncertainty that does exist. My amendment attempts to \nclarify those areas that are now causing such uncertainty, but it does \nso in a way that does not cause injury in a range of other areas.\n  My amendment creates certain safe harbors for employers who establish \nwork units, quality circles and other employer-employee committees or \nteams, provided that working conditions are discussed only on an \noccasional basis incidental to the purpose of the committee. In other \nwords, we do not want to have a circumstance where some employer-\ndominated committee--some employer-dominated committee--selected by the \nemployer\n\n[[Page S7472]]\n\nfor a specific purpose, runs off and gets involved in a whole range of \ndiscussions about matters that are more appropriately a part of \ncollective bargaining or matters outside the purview of what is allowed \nin the NLRB.\n  In the legislation I have offered, we provide specific guidance in \nthese areas, and I think we do so in a way that is appropriate. Page 4 \nof the amendment provides:\n\n       (A) It shall not constitute or be evidence of an unfair \n     labor practice under section 8(a)(2) for an employer to meet \n     with the employees as a group, or to meet with each of the \n     employees individually, to share information, to brainstorm, \n     to receive suggestions or opinions from individual employees, \n     with respect to matters of mutual interest, including matters \n     relating to working conditions.\n       (B) It shall not constitute or be evidence of an unfair \n     labor practice under section 8(a)(2) for an employer to \n     assign employees to work units and to hold regular meetings \n     of employees assigned to a work unit to discuss matters \n     relating to the work responsibilities of the unit. The \n     meetings may, on occasion, include discussions with respect \n     to the conditions of work of the employees assigned to the \n     unit.\n       (C) It shall not constitute or be evidence of an unfair \n     labor practice under section 8(a)(2) for an employer to \n     establish a committee composed of employees of the employer \n     to make recommendations or determinations on ways of \n     improving the quality of, or method of producing and \n     distributing, the employer's product or service and to hold \n     regular meetings of the committee to discuss matters relating \n     to the committee. The meetings may, on occasion, include \n     discussions with respect to any directly related issues \n     concerning conditions of work of the employees.\n\n  When the U.S. House, the other body, debated this issue, there was an \namendment offered by Congressman Sawyer that received, I believe, 204 \nvotes. It did not prevail, but it was a very close vote and received \nsome bipartisan support. The amendment I offer today is very similar to \nthe Sawyer amendment that was offered in the House--identical with \nrespect to the provisions, similar with respect to the language that \nestablishes those provisions.\n  This is not a new subject. It was substantially debated in the House \nof Representatives. My colleagues who followed that debate will \nrecognize that what I am attempting to do here in the Senate is exactly \nwhat Congressman Sawyer did in the House. I changed some of the \nlanguage in the amendment but did not change the substance of the \namendment itself.\n\n  Again, let me say that I believe cooperation in the workplace has \nmerit. I believe it enhances our country's capability. It enhances the \nopportunity of businesses to be more productive, to be more efficient. \nIt is helpful to both the employer and the employee. It will not, under \nany condition, be helpful to harmony in the workplace, to efficiency, \nor to improving this country's competitiveness, to do something that \nchanges labor law under the guise of the TEAM Act, that will cause more \nuncertainty and more strife with respect to organized workers in this \ncountry.\n  That will happen if we enact legislation that infringes in areas that \nare now of the province of what normally would be collectively \nbargaining. We do not want to retreat to a circumstance where employers \npick their team and say, ``By the way, we now have a cooperative team \nof employees.'' It so happened that Uncle Joe, the person who runs this \nplace, picked the four of them, handpicked the four, and now these four \npresumably speak for all other employees. Well, that moves directly \ntoward the establishment of management unions, which, in my judgment, \nis and should be a violation of labor law. We do not want to pass a \nTEAM Act that does that. We do want to pass a TEAM Act that fosters, \nenhances, and encourages cooperation in the workplace.\n  My amendment, I believe, does that. I hope the Senate would view the \namendment in a positive way. We will have more discussion on it, but \nother Members on my side would like to use some time. With that, I \nyield the floor.\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM. Mr. President, I will briefly respond to the Senator \nfrom North Dakota, because much of what he said echoes my earlier \ncomments. We are both addressing the importance of cooperation in the \nworkplace, and both of us are acknowledging that there is a problem \nwith the law at this point, and there needs to be a clarification \nregarding the National Labor Relations Act.\n  For a long time, it has been argued that there is no problem with the \nlaw--that teams could continue without running afoul of the National \nLabor Relations Act. I think the Senator from North Dakota acknowledges \nthat there needs to be some clarification. However, I am not sure from \nwhat was said--and I have not had a chance to read the language of the \namendment that has been introduced because it is different than we had \nthought it was going to be--about what sort of specific guidance he was \nlaying out in his amendment and what he believes are the problems in \nthe TEAM Act itself that cause the disturbance that he believes it \nwould in the workplace.\n  These are things that I hope, Mr. President, we can explore, as we \nhave a chance to address some questions regarding the amendment that \nwas put down by the Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I yield 10 minutes to the Senator from \nIllinois, Senator Simon.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois is recognized.\n  Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, I thank my colleague. I rise in support of \nthe Dorgan amendment. I think it makes sense. It provides balance. It \nmakes it clear that if the Kempthorne Industries, for example, decide \nthey want to have a committee to look at the question of plant safety \nor plan a picnic for the staff, or anything else, they can do that.\n  But the Dorgan amendment also says if you are going to get into a \nquestion of wages and hours, and the traditional benefits, the \ntraditional labor-management things, that should be left up to the \nconventional process. You should not have employers appointing a \ncommittee of employees. The employees, when you get into labor-\nmanagement issues like wages and hours and so forth, should be left to \na committee picked by the employees. I think that makes sense. I think \nit contains balance.\n  I add that I think balance is the one word we need in labor-\nmanagement relations in this country today. I was interested a while \nback in picking up the New York Times and seeing where George Shultz, \nwhom we think of primarily as the former Secretary of State, and noting \nthat George Shultz also was the Secretary of Labor at one point under a \nRepublican administration, saying our laws have gone out of balance in \nterms of not being balanced enough in the direction of encouraging \nlabor organizations and the result is going to be a loss of \nproductivity in our country. I think that point is an extremely \nimportant point.\n  I have introduced a series of seven bills that I think also provide a \nlittle balance. For example, in this whole area of labor-management \nrelations, if you have a pattern in practice of violating the Labor \nRelations Act, you can still get a Federal contract; while, if you have \na pattern in practice of violating civil rights laws, you cannot get a \nFederal contract. I think the example of the civil rights laws is what \nwe ought to follow in the labor laws also. I do not know why we should \naward companies that have a pattern and practice of violating labor \nlaws with Federal contracts. I mention this because I think there we \nneed balance. I think the Dorgan amendment provides balance.\n  I think what we want is to say to an employer, if the Kempthorne \nCorporation, or the Kassebaum Corporation, or the Dorgan Corporation, \nor the Simon Corporation, if as an employer I want to appoint a \ncommittee to look at plant safety, or lighting in the plant, or \nplanning an annual banquet, that is a fine thing. I do not think plant \nmanagement ought to have the ability to say this is a committee of \nemployees that is going to negotiate with me in terms of wages and \nhours. I think the National Labor Relations Act should be left as it is \non that issue.\n  So I am going to strongly support the Dorgan amendment. I think it is \na move in the right direction. I hope that we can get a majority to \nfavor it.\n  One of the things that has happened, Mr. President, over the years in \nmy 22 years here is that we have become excessively partisan. I have \nsaid this before on the floor. I think an amendment like the Dorgan \namendment is one that frankly Republicans and Democrats alike ought to \nbe supporting. I think it makes eminent good sense.\n\n[[Page S7473]]\n\n  Mr. President, I am about at the end of my time. I see two of my \ncolleagues standing. I yield the floor at this point.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Thompson). The Senator from Kansas.\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM. Mr. President, if I may respond for a moment, just to \nassure the Senator from Illinois that I wish I could support the \namendment of the Senator from North Dakota. I think there is still some \ndifficulty with it that we need to consider, however. But I want to \nassure you that the TEAM Act does nothing to change the ability for \ncollective bargaining on wages and hours. This specifically is stated--\nthat it in no way wants to reinterpret the National Labor Relations \nAct, and it is not an infringement on that. It is a clarification where \nactually the chairman said there needs to be a clarification regarding \nsection 882. On the other hand, I want to make clear that he does not \nsupport the TEAM Act. But I would like to so ask some questions.\n\n  Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, if my colleague will yield.\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. SIMON. Just to respond by saying when you say it needs \nclarification, the reality is we have had clarification. For example, \nCalifornia has had 29,000-and-some cases brought before the NLRB. They \nhave had two cases before the NLRB which said you have a problem here \nin creating a company union through management. And then they did not \nfine anyone. They just sent it back to them and said restructure it. \nThe State of Illinois with 12 million people--I do not know how many \ncases; I forget; just one case nationally. We have only had half a \ndozen. I really do not think there needs to be the clarification that \nmy friend and colleague from Kansas suggests is needed.\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM. Mr. President, I can appreciate that. But just that \none case which came up, as I gave an illustration of--the Dillon stores \nin Kansas--the grocery stores, and a ruling then that had the chilling \neffect and has caused a number of nonunion settings of employees and \nemployers to be very uncertain. And actually that is what I think the \nSenator from North Dakota was saying. There was some uncertainty, and \nin trying to address with specificity I think it becomes too specific.\n  If I just may mention, at least as I understand it, that there are \nthree categories that are addressed in the amendment of Senator Dorgan. \nI think again it goes back to a rigidity and a lack of flexibility that \nI think is important. I do not think you can have three categories and \nthree sizes that would fit all. I would like to see if I am correct in \nthis.\n  One would be an employee in a brainstorming discussion group that can \nonly meet for a short duration of time to discuss matters of mutual \ninterest. If workers and supervisors want to discuss important \nworkplace issues on a regular basis, that would not be permitted under \nthis category. When important workplace issues are raised, managers \nwould have to tell workers that further discussions would be illegal. \nIf that is, indeed, the intent of the language in the amendment, I \nthink again specificity that does not allow for a flexibility that we \nwere trying to encourage with employer-employee discussions.\n  Also, there would be employee work teams that were established for a \nduration that could discuss quality and productivity issues. But \ndiscussions on workplace issues like health and safety, or vacations, \nor other issues, child care and so forth, could occur only \nsporadically. When work teams have exhausted their quota of discussion \ntime on important issues like safety, then managers would have to \nterminate further discussion, or face violating Federal law.\n  I do not want to add words that are not theirs. But it seems to me \nthat these are providing conditions that even further confuse what \ncould or could not be done.\n  Then the third is what I think are called employee committees which \nmay discuss again workplace issues like safety and no smoking policies \nas often is desired. However, the employees chosen by secret ballot \nelection under NLRB procedures have a new entitlement--the assistance \nof outside experts to address issues before the committee. I understand \nthat was taken out. But I do not know what the third employee committee \ndoes. But it is a committee structure that I think in the specificity \nlends itself to even further concern about whether there would be a \nclear understanding of what could or could not be done.\n  So again, I think it is very important for us to explore this and \nwith a clear understanding of whether we have actually complicated the \nprocedure or have enhanced clarification.\n  Mr. COVERDELL addressed the Chair.\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM. I yield the Senator from Georgia 10 minutes.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. That will be fine. I appreciate the yielding of time \nfrom the Senator from Kansas.\n  Mr. President, I rise in support of the amendment of the Senator from \nKansas and the Senator from Maine, Ms. Snowe, called the TEAM Act.\n  I might, in my opening statement here, make the point that the \nworkers themselves from my State are those who are contacting our \noffice in support. It is the laborers, it is the working men and women \nof my State who have created a steady flow through our office in \nsupport of what the Senator from Kansas is endeavoring to do.\n  A recent example. There is a company in Lawrenceville, GA, which is \njust northeast of Atlanta. It reduced its manufacturing costs within \nits plant $6 million through the efforts of teamwork. The team \nconsisted of nine employees, people from the assembly line to plant \nmanagers. They met for 6 months. They brought in experts throughout the \ncompany to give advice. The end result? A savings of nearly $6 million \nfrom these workers.\n  The problem with this is that without the amendment being offered by \nthe Senator from Kansas, this company and people engaged in this \nactivity are at risk from the National Labor Relations Board. They \ncould be held to be in violation of the law and regulations. So the \neffort by the Senator from Kansas is to create legislation that does \nenormous good in the workplace because it allows teams like this one I \nhave just described to assemble and yet not be at risk. Great good \ncould occur throughout our country.\n  I want to read a press release I just received the other day from the \nEmployment Policy Foundation. It reads:\n\n       Lost in the current political controversy about increasing \n     the minimum wage and passing the TEAM Act is the fact that \n     only the TEAM Act promises a better economic future for most \n     of America's working families. American living standards and \n     workers' compensation have been rising slowly over the past \n     decade largely because productivity has been growing slowly. \n     The TEAM Act, which reforms outdated rules that impede the \n     formation of workplace teams in nonunion settings, sets a \n     path to a higher productive growth. It does so by clarifying \n     the legal status of teams whose continued and expanded use \n     are in jeopardy--\n\n  Just as I said a moment ago.\n\n       because of a series of National Labor Relations Board \n     decisions.\n       The Foundation's recent study estimating the potential \n     productivity in real wage effects of employee involvement \n     reports documented productivity gains of 18 to 25 percent \n     from workplace employee involvement systems in which teams \n     play a central role.\n\n  Mr. President, much of the workplace today is governed by laws and \nlegislation that is three to four decades old. We are coming on a new \ncentury, and it is time to modernize and make more flexible the \nworkplace of the new century. It is time to turn away from the status \nquo. The TEAM Act is a progressive idea. It is an inclusive idea. It is \nan idea that will help stimulate the economy and make more comfortable \nthe workplace for thousands and thousands of American families.\n  By a 3-to-1 margin when asked to choose between two types of \norganizations to represent them, workers chose one that would have no \npower but would have management cooperation over one with power but \nwithout management cooperation. In this same survey, the worker \nrepresentation and participation survey conducted in December 1994 by \nPrinceton Survey Research Associates, 79 percent of workers who had \nparticipated in employee management teams reported having personally \nbenefited from the process.\n\n  I can personally testify that the corporation in which I grew up has \nemployed a vast series and array of employee-managed teams. It has had \nan enormous effect on that company, a very positive effect on the \ncompany. Everybody is engaged in the overall\n\n[[Page S7474]]\n\nwelfare of the company and where it is going. Morale is higher. It has \nbeen a tremendous asset to this company in which I have personal \nknowledge.\n  What happened by looking at this personal situation, though, is \nnothing more than a reflection of what is going on or potentially can \ngo on all across our country.\n  Mr. President, on Friday, June 21, of this year, a letter signed by \nthe chief executive officers of 624 companies and trade associations \nwho support passage of the TEAM Act was delivered to President Clinton \nasking the President to reject a veto and seize this chance to lead by \nsupporting legislation that enables employees and managers to \ncooperate.\n  Again, Mr. President, what I am saying here is that this legislation, \nsponsored by the Senator from Kansas, is a move to the new century. It \nis a move to a modern workplace. It is a move to flexibility. It is a \nmove to better morale. We have great anxiety and frustration in the \nworkplace today. This kind of legislation, which offers a move toward a \nmodern setting, is absolutely required.\n  The letter that I referred to a moment ago was prepared in response \nto repeated statements by Secretary of Labor Robert Reich and the AFL-\nCIO that few companies care about passage of the TEAM Act.\n  I do not know where they are getting their information, but it is not \ncorroborated by any survey I have seen. It is not corroborated by any \nof the employees who have come at their own expense to Washington from \nGeorgia to argue in support of what the Senator from Kansas is \nendeavoring to do. It is not supported by anything I have personally \nseen in the workplace. I have had a chance to look at these teams and \nwatch what it does to company productivity and company morale.\n  The letter to the President, as I said, is dated June 21. It said:\n\n       In your State of the Union Address this last January, you \n     said, ``When companies and workers work as a team, they do \n     better and so does America.'' We agree, and your leadership \n     is needed now to allow 85 percent of the American work force \n     to respond effectively to your call.\n\n  The only way you could characterize opposition to this modern device \nin the workplace is that old ideas adopted by AFL-CIO labor leaders in \nWashington simply cannot abide by modernizing the workplace. They are \nbenefited by leaving things just the way they are, where they feel they \ncan be in complete control.\n  I point out that the measure very carefully does not affect \ncollective bargaining. It just allows American workers the same \nbenefits that are accruing in industrialized nations all around the \nworld and that have threatened our competitiveness. It is time for us \nto modernize our workplace. It is time for us to allow our creative \nworkplace to do those things that our competitors are doing so we can \nmatch them in this global economy.\n  Mr. President, I yield back any time I have remaining to the Senator \nfrom Kansas.\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM. Mr. President, I wish to express my appreciation to \nthe Senator from Georgia for his comments. I know that he cares a great \ndeal about trying to make sure we can have a creative and constructive \nenvironment in the workplace, certainly in the State of Georgia. He \nalso recognizes how that environment has helped businesses grow in the \nState of Georgia.\n  I would like to add a comment about something else that was stated \nearlier, that there was really no need for us to have this legislation; \nthat, as a matter of fact, there were many cases that had been \nfavorably handled and that there was not a worry in the workplace.\n  I would just like to give an example of why there is concern. A \nNational Labor Relations Board administrative law judge has handed down \na decision in the long-awaited Polaroid case. The Polaroid Co. has been \nheralded as one of America's most progressive companies, having \nchampioned workplace collaboration since the 1930's.\n  Following the NLRB's decision in the 1992 Electromation case, which \nsparked this effort to try to clarify the National Labor Relations Act, \nPolaroid concluded that its 60-year-old teams violated the Board's \nrule. The company tried to restructure its committee organization to \ncomply, but the NLRB's June 14 decision shows the futility of such \nefforts. Even though the new committee structure was much weaker than \nthe old, the administrative law judge ordered it disbanded.\n  Polaroid further illustrates for employers the clear rule on \nmeaningful workplace cooperation: If it happens in a nonunion setting, \nit is regarded as illegal.\n  The Polaroid case also addresses another argument propounded \nrepeatedly by the opponents of cooperation in nonunion settings: The \nTEAM Act is not necessary because antiteamwork NLRB decisions only \nhappen in small companies that are not household names. Certainly \nPolaroid is a household name. It is one we have all heard of, and I \nthink the Polaroid case clearly illustrates why the current law has \ncaused uncertainty throughout the Nation's companies as they try to \ncomply with the letter of the law.\n  To quote from a press release of Bill Gould, Chairman of the National \nLabor Relations Board, on June 6, in which he said in a speech in \nOmaha:\n       In a non-union situation, the sensible response to all of \n     this is to allow employee groups, with or without a \n     management representative component, to discuss anything that \n     they would like to, whether it be wages, break periods or the \n     problems confronted in selling the product. The more that \n     workers know about the enterprise and the better that they \n     are able to participate effectively in decision making, the \n     more likely it is that both democratic values and \n     competitiveness are enhanced. And, if the law is simplified, \n     lay people--ordinary workers and small business persons--will \n     be able to adapt to their own circumstances and avoid \n     reliance upon wasteful litigation and the high priced counsel \n     that go with it.\n\n  He went on to say:\n\n       Employers ought to be able to promote the creation of and \n     to subsidize employee groups. In the real world that is what \n     is happening anyway. With workers unrepresented by unions in \n     85 percent of the workforce, how else can such systems \n     flourish?\n\n  To be fair, as I said before, Chairman Gould does not support the \nTEAM Act that is before us. But clearly his statement in Omaha in June \nindicates that he does believe the very problem we are trying to \naddress in the TEAM Act should be addressed. I believe, however, that \nthe problem is addressed in the TEAM Act in such a way that it could be \nsupported by a broad range of those on both sides of the aisle. Those \nwho speak in opposition clearly are those who fear it will do something \nthat, indeed, it could not do. By the language in this legislation, \ntheir fears could not be realized--it in no way infringes on the \ncollective bargaining process or the letter of the law in the National \nLabor Relations Act.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum with the time to be \nequally divided.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The clerk \nwill call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I urge the Senate to reject the TEAM Act. \nIts supporters pretend it is needed to increase the competitiveness of \nAmerican industry, and they pretend it will promote the kind of \ncooperative workplaces that will have an advantage in the world \neconomy. But those arguments are a sham.\n  This legislation has nothing to do with cooperation and everything to \ndo with undermining workers' rights. It overturns one of the \nfundamental protections of American law, that employers cannot set up \ncompany-dominated unions as a trick to prevent workers from joining \nreal unions.\n  No one opposes honest cooperation between labor and management in the \nworkplace. But Congress should not try to tip the balance by siding \nwith union-busting employers.\n  Do not be fooled by the smokescreen set up by the employer coalition \nthat wants this legislation. This bill is designed for one purpose \nonly: To nullify the critical provisions of current law that make it \nillegal for any employer to dominate or interfere with a labor \norganization.\n  Under the TEAM Act, management can create a labor organization, \ndominate it, interfere with it, or terminate it as management sees fit \nas long as management does not try to engage in\n\n[[Page S7475]]\n\ncollective bargaining or create legally enforceable rights.\n  What does this mean? It means that employers will be permitted to \nsubstitute a representative they control for a genuine representative \nof the employees. The TEAM Act would make it legal for management to \nfoist a labor organization on employees that employees did not ask for \nor did not vote for. It would be legal for management to impose a \ncompany-dominated union made up of employees handpicked solely by the \nemployer. They would meet when the employer sees fit, consider only the \nissues the employer wants considered, and then speak for all the \nemployees when they do so.\n  The Senate should have no part of puppet unions like that. Making \nthat kind of one-sided, phony labor organization legal has nothing to \ndo with promoting labor-management cooperation or competitiveness. It \nhas nothing to do with empowering employees. It is cynically designed \nto increase the power of employers and give managers more and more \ncontrol over the lives of their employees. If management can dominate \nemployees' organizations, they can control the demands that employees \nmake for better pay and better working conditions.\n  That is precisely what happened in the court case that proponents of \nthe TEAM Act rely on. In the Electromation case, an Indiana \nmanufacturer responded to employee unrest about wages and benefits by \nsetting up employee action committees that the company dominated and \ncontrolled. In the words of the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals for the \nSeventh Circuit, the company proposed and essentially imposed the \naction committees upon its employees as the only acceptable mechanism \nfor resolution of their acknowledged grievances.\n  Electromation unilaterally selected the size, structure and \nprocedural function of the committees. It decided the number of \ncommittees and the topics to be addressed by each. Despite the fact \nthat the employees were seriously concerned about the lack of a wage \nincrease, no action committee was designated to consider this specific \nissue. I repeat that. Despite the fact that the employees were \nseriously concerned about the lack of a wage increase, no action \ncommittee was designated to consider this specific issue. In this way, \nElectromation actually controlled which issues received attention by \nthe committee and which did not.\n  That is precisely the kind of domineering management behavior that \nthe TEAM Act would legalize. Electromation demonstrates what this bill \nwould do. Senators who think it is right for employers to impose a sham \norganization on their employees, who think it is right for the employer \nto control which grievances employees can air and how and when they can \nbe aired should vote for the TEAM Act. But do not pretend you are \nvoting for cooperation in the workplace. If you reverse the \nElectromation case, you are voting for domination of employees, not \ncooperation with employees.\n  The National Labor Relations Board, made up exclusively of members \nappointed by Republican Presidents, made clear the Electromation \ncompany only wanted to control the discontent of its employees after \nthe company unilaterally changed wages and working conditions. The case \nhas nothing to do with cooperation, quality or efficiency.\n  In the words of the NLRB, the purpose of the action committee was, as \nthe record demonstrates, not to enable management and employees to \ncooperate to improve quality or efficiency, but to create in employees \nthe impression that their disagreements with management had been \nresolved bilaterally.\n  In short, the company was engaged in a fraud on the employees, and \nthe TEAM Act would legalize that fraud.\n  Some have suggested there is no harm in the kind of phony labor \norganization the NLRB struck down, because sooner or later the \nemployees will discover the fraud and reject the employer-controlled \ncommittee. They argue nothing in the TEAM Act prevents employees from \nvoting for a real union that would truly represent their interests.\n  But many of the employees in the Electromation case did see through \nthe fraudulent action committees created by the company's management. \nThey wanted to be represented by a union. They petitioned for a union \nelection, but they were defeated. The NLRB filed a complaint against \nthe company for the unfair labor practice of dominating a labor \norganization. The company suspended the action committees, and the \nunion won a rerun of the election.\n  Once the Government stepped in and protected the employees' rights, \nthe employees exercised those rights. Without the current law, the \nphony committees would never have been suspended, and the union would \nnever have won.\n  That is what the TEAM Act is all about: Substituting sham, company-\ndominated unions for genuine employee representatives. If the TEAM Act \npasses and employers are given the green light to create sham \norganizations, it will be harder for unions to organize. That is the \nreal goal of the TEAM Act, and the Senate should have no part of it.\n  Let us have genuine cooperation, not fake cooperation, in the \nworkplace. It is wrong for employers to impose organizations on their \nemployees that they have not asked for or voted for.\n  No one, that the employees have not chosen, should be given the \nauthority to represent them. American workers today have the right that \nCongress gave them 61 years ago to choose their own representatives--\nthat is what this issue is really all about--whenever they discuss the \nissues of wages, hours and working conditions with their employer. The \nTEAM Act would take that right away, and it deserves to be defeated by \nthe Senate and vetoed.\n\n  Mr. President, I point out, once again, for the benefit of the \nmembers of the committee, our own committee report that was filed by \nthe majority, with a minority report as well, on page 8 of that report, \nwhat the current situation is with regard to cooperation.\n  All of us want cooperation. All of us want the increase in \nefficiency, increase in competitiveness. That is taking place today. It \nis taking place with regard to health and safety, which had been \nreferred to earlier in the debate. In the State of Washington and the \nState of Oregon, these worker committees have gotten together to \nconsider health and safety issues. They have been appointed by the \nemployer and representatives of the workers. They have worked very \neffectively.\n  We have seen significant reductions of Workmen's Compensation costs \nin the States of Washington and Oregon because of these joint \ncommittees of cooperation. They are taking place today, and they are \nworking.\n  We have seen even, according to the business organizations in that \nState, the savings for businesses in the State of Washington of over $1 \nbillion in the last 5 years because of this kind of cooperation. That \nis taking place today.\n  We had tried to advance a similar concept 2 years ago, and we were \nopposed in the Human Resources Committee by our Republican friends. We \nwere trying to share and encourage that kind of cooperation that was \ntaking place in the States and saving workers billions of dollars that \nwere effectively being denied them with increased wages because they \nend up on Workmen's Compensation, as well as denying employers a \ngreater return on their investment. Our Republican friends responded: \n``No, we aren't going to have any part of that but as a substitute \nunder the word of 'TEAM.' We have this other proposal.''\n  The committee majority report indicates ``Employee Involvement \nWorks.''\n\n       During the past 20 years--\n\n  This is the majority. This is those favoring the alleged TEAM Act.\n\n       During the past 20 years, employee involvement has emerged \n     as the most dramatic development in human resources \n     management. One reason is that worker involvement has become \n     a key method of improving American competitiveness.\n       Evidence of the success--and corresponding proliferation--\n     of employee involvement can be found in a 1994 survey of \n     employers performed at the request of the Commission on the \n     Future of Worker-Management Relations. The survey found that \n     75 percent of responding employers--large and small--had \n     incorporated some means of employee involvement in their \n     operations.\n\n  That is going on now. That is taking place today. Meaningful \ncooperation is taking place today.\n\n       Among the larger employers--those with 5,000 or more \n     employees--the percentage was even higher, at 96 percent. It \n     is estimated that as many as 30,000 employers currently\n\n[[Page S7476]]\n\n     employ some form of employee involvement or participation.\n\n  It is working. This is a problem that effectively does not exist, \nwith the exception of those particular employers who want to use this \nas a means and a device to undermine legitimate worker interests in \nterms of their working conditions and in terms of their future salaries \nand their economic interests.\n\n       The success of employee involvement can also be found in \n     the views of American workers. A survey conducted by the \n     Princeton Research Associates found overwhelming support for \n     employee involvement programs among workers, with 79 percent \n     of those who participated in such programs reporting having \n     ``personally benefitted'' from the process. Indeed, 76 \n     percent of all workers surveyed believed that their companies \n     would be more competitive if more decisions about production \n     and operations were made by employees rather than managers.\n\n  It is happening today. It is going on as we are here this afternoon.\n\n       Clearly, employee involvement is more than just another \n     passing fad in human resources development. Over the last 20 \n     years, it has evolved--along with a global economy--into a \n     basic component of the modern workplace and a key to \n     successful labor-management relations. As such, American \n     industry must be allowed to use employee involvement in order \n     to utilize more effectively its most valuable resource--the \n     American worker.\n\n  Everything on there we agree with. That is not what this is about. \nThat is taking place. Even the majority is pointing out that 30,000 \nemployers currently are doing this. So it is suggested by some, well, \nthey cannot do it enough or they are concerned about this particular \nissue and this particular problem.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time on the amendment has expired.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I ask, Mr. President, what is the time agreement?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is an hour on the bill, equally divided. \nThe Senator could use some time off the bill.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Yes. I will yield myself 15 minutes on the bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized for 15 minutes.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, now just to refer to the fact that \ncooperation between the employers and the employees is necessary. The \nmajority has recognized that in the largest plants, it is about 96 \npercent being utilized and in the smaller plants over 75 percent.\n  So now let us look at what has happened since 1992, since this \nElectromation case that evidently is causing all of this uncertainty \nout there with regard to this kind of cooperation--there are 30,000 \ncompanies where this is taking place. ``The NLRB Orders to Disestablish \nWork Committees,'' from 1992 through 1995, 4 years. And 30,000 \nemployers doing it.\n  Are there any disestablishment orders in the State of Washington? No, \nnot even one. Any in the State of Oregon? No. Zero. In the State of \nNevada, zero. These are cases allegedly that are being brought, can be \nbrought by employees, employers. disestablishments in California, two. \nUtah, zero. Arizona, zero. Alaska, zero. One in Colorado. None in \nWyoming. And the list goes on. None in North Dakota. None in South \nDakota.\n  What is the problem, Mr. President? We are saying we are all for \ncooperation. If we do not have a problem, I think it is reasonable to \nask, what is really the purpose behind this legislative effort? And I \nsuggest that the real purpose of it is not just to develop the \ncooperation, which is taking place today, but is effectively to \nundermine the legitimate economic interests of the workers in those \nparticular States.\n  Mr. President, we can look at how much of a problem this is. I hope \nour colleagues will look through this. This is a handful of cases \nbetween 1992 and 1995 that this bill is supposed to correct.\n  Mr. President, if we look over here we can see that this is even more \ngraphic as to what the true problem is; 8(a)(2) charges--these are the \ncharges that we are considering here to address the TEAM Act--227.\n  Now 8(a)(3) charges. What are these? These are the firings of various \nworkers for their participation in union activity or trying to join a \nunion. They are being dismissed, illegally, by their employers. Those \nare 8(a)(3) charges, 13,000. Compared to 8(a)(2), 227.\n  Look. In 8(a)(2) remedies, 87 remedies out of the 227. Look. Remedies \nfor reinstatement, 7,000; and 8,000 for remedies of back pay. Remedies \nfor reinstatement are when there has been adverse action by the \nemployer, violating the law. That is what these cases are, 7,900 of \nthem in 1994 to reinstate because of illegal activity by the employer \nversus 87 with regard to 8(a)(2).\n  It seems to me if we ought to be here this afternoon, we ought to be \ndoing something about these workers that are being illegally abused and \ntreated in their employment by employers. For 8(a)(3), 8,500 were \nreinstated with remedies for back pay.\n  Mr. President, nonetheless, we are asked to go on out here because of \nthis uncertainty, allegedly. We do not have any record to indicate that \nthis is a major problem. What we do have is the major indication about \nwhat is happening out there in the real working places of this country. \nWe are interested in cooperation. But the way to get it is to have \nemployers respect employees and to have that vice versa, Mr. President. \nThat is done when you have effective collective bargaining.\n  What has happened? ``Proportion of the NLRB Elections in which a \nUnion Supporter is Illegally''--Illegally--``Discharged.'' If we were \naround here to consider what we ought to be doing something about, look \nat the growth, according to the NLRB, in cases where a worker is \nillegally discharged, from 1975 to 1985, and right up here in the \n1990's. The increase of 400 or 500 percent, depending how you want to \ncalculate it, over that period of time, where we are finding \nindividuals--individuals --are pursuing their economic rights for \nthemselves, their wives, their children, illegally discharged under the \ncurrent law. That is what is going on out here in this country.\n\n  Here is another chart that would support the same kind of analysis in \nterms of the 8(a) charges. In the early years you find out, between \n1950 and 1954, for the 8(a)(3) charges, the number of average annual \nback pay awards going up considerably here, as it indicates that these \nworkers are being illegally fired. The average number of reinstatements \ncontinues to escalate because they are being illegally fired. That is \nhappening to individuals.\n  Finally, Mr. President, this other chart I have back here would \nindicate what the percent is of the total number of cases that we are \ntalking about. I direct our colleagues right up here, 8(a)(2). Of this \nwhole pie, for the illegal activities of employers against workers, for \nall of this whole pie, this tiny slice is it, right in this darkened \narea, 227 cases. Yet we are being asked to legislate on this particular \nissue.\n  It is a problem, Mr. President, that does not exist. This is being \npromoted, supported, for legislative action by those who are the most \nstrongly committed to denying equal justice and fair justice to the \nworkers of this country. That is why it is not coincidental that we \nwill have this debate and a vote tomorrow, and we will have the vote on \nanother proposal that is antiworker on the issue of the right to work.\n  We will have the proposal for a cloture to end debate on the right to \nwork bill. The bill was put down last Friday. We have been under \ncontrolled time on these other matters for the time. But, nonetheless, \nwe will be asked to vote to end debate. I do not know of any filibuster \nthat has been promoted on that measure, but we will be asked to vote to \nend debate, despite the fact it was never reported out of committee. We \nhad one day of hearings. It was never reported out of the committee. \nAnd they laid down a cloture motion on that legislation to deny any \nkind of discussion, debate.\n  We are going to have that. We will have these two measures, one on a \nmatter that is really not before the workers and employers of this \ncountry. The report itself has demonstrated the expansion of work \ncooperation, which we agree with and which we support. The total number \nof cases are pitifully small against a background where there is \nincreasing illegal activity against workers. And their interests are \nbeing ignored.\n  Mr. President, just to speak very briefly for just a few moments on \nthe issues of the right to work. It is so interesting that it is our \nRepublican colleagues who are constantly talking about the right to \nwork issue. We now find that there are some 23 States that are right-\nto-work States. The remaining majority of States are not right-to-\n\n[[Page S7477]]\n\nwork States. So States have been making their minds up under the \ncurrent and existing law. States have been deciding what is in their \ninterest.\n  How many times have we heard that talked about here on the floor of \nthe U.S. Senate? States ought to be able to make their judgments. We do \nnot want the long arm of the Federal Government interfering with the \nlegitimate interests of the States. Now wait a minute, with the \nexception of the right to work. There we want a Federal imposition of a \nnational policy that will have the right-to-work statute override State \nlaw.\n  What does that really and effectively do? This is the interesting \npoint. Under the current law there is no requirement that any worker be \nrequired to join a union if the decision is made by the members, the \nworkers in there, to go and vote for a union. They are not, under \ncurrent law, required to join. But if they are going to continue to \nwork there, and there is going to be continued enhancement in terms of \ntheir wages, working conditions, in their child-care programs, and \ntheir pension as a result of collective bargaining, they can be \nrequired under the current law--if both the employer and the union \nagree--to at least pay for that part of the union activity that is \ngoing to enhance their benefits. In other words, no freeloaders, no \nfreeloaders.\n  If they are going to be a part of the work force in a particular \nplant or factory, and they choose not to join their union, they have \nthat right not to do so. If the union goes ahead and gets an increase \nin terms of wages, an increase in their health care benefits, an \nincrease in consideration for child care or other kinds of activities \nas a result of their activity, then that individual has to make a \ncontribution to the extent that those dues would be used to finance \nthat financial and economic enhancement. OK, that is what the \nconditions are under the law today.\n  Now, we will have a situation when we vote tomorrow, we will vote on \ncloture on a bill that will say, ``Look, to those workers that are out \nthere, if you in your particular company vote to have a union, you do \nnot even have to pay for any of the basic improvements that you get in \nyour working conditions.'' If that union goes on out and has a strike \nand enhances their economic conditions, increases their wages, improves \nworking conditions, increases health care, gets better coverage for \npatients, pensioners, and better coverage for children at the end of \nthe day, that other individual who gets the same benefits does not have \nto pay a thing, does not have to pay a thing.\n  That is the effect of the passage of a national right-to-work law. \nThat is what this act is all about. Apparently, some Senators do not \nthink that the people in Massachusetts or the State of Washington or \nthe State of Kansas or any other State can understand that concept \nsufficiently enough to be able to make their own judgment. We, in our \nalmighty wisdom, say that we are going to make that judgment here on \nthe floor of the U.S. Senate, and even cutting off more debate.\n  Mr. President, how can you interpret that to be anything more than a \nwholesale assault on the economic rights and the struggling efforts \nthat have been a part of the trade union movement to enhance their \nworking conditions and economic justice in this country? At a time, Mr. \nPresident, when the rich are getting richer, when the top 20 percent \nare the ones that are benefiting the most from this economic expansion, \nand the other 80 percent of Americans are being left out and being left \nbehind in too many instances, there is just a wholesale assault on \nthose working families. What is it about us that we want to take it out \non these working families? I do not understand it.\n  Looking at the economic history from 1950 to the early 1970's, \neveryone moved along together. We all went along together. Americans \nwent along together. Now we see this enormous disparity when those that \nare the weakest, entering the job market, denied the opportunities in \neducation because of changes in our education system and the support \nsystems to permit qualified, talented young Americans to go to schools \nand colleges and get the training. At a time when they have that need, \nwhat are we saying? We are saying, on the one hand, under the TEAM Act, \nwe are going to give more and more authority and power to the employer, \nto take it out on you, the workers, on the backs of the working men and \nwomen, by weakening your economic ability to look out for your \ninterests. Not only are we going to do that, but we will superimpose a \nnational right-to-work program that on the other hand is going to \nremove any kind of responsibility from those who are working in a \nworkplace where they get economic advantages are going to be \nparticipating and paying their fair share. No, you can be a freeloader \nin America; you can be a freeloader. Others who want to work through \nthe economic system and work through collective bargaining, if they get \nsome benefit, you can stay and get all the benefits free and clear, and \nwe have to make that judgment here.\n  That has been against a background where we have had this constant \nresistance to provide any increase in the minimum wage, and only \nreluctantly and finally today have we been able to have the opportunity \nto gain an expression on the floor of the U.S. Senate to provide an \nincrease in the minimum wage. It is against a background of continued \nefforts to undermine the earned-income tax credit which works, again, \nfor the low-income workers who have children.\n  Now, you just cannot say, Mr. President, that this is all accidental, \nit is all coincidental. We are also declaring war on Davis-Bacon. The \naverage income for construction workers is $27,000. I was so amazed and \ninterested that as soon as our Republican friends gained control of the \nU.S. Senate, one of the first things they did was offer a repeal of the \nDavis-Bacon Act, which requires payment of the prevailing local wage \nfor construction workers in this country so that the Federal Government \nwill not be a promoter or detractor in terms of the wages----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I yield myself 10 minutes.\n  That the Government would not be a participant in trying to tilt the \nscale of economic justice in the bidding on construction contracts. \nThey came right here on the floor of the Senate and tried to repeal \nthat particular protection, undermine the conditions for construction \nworkers--who average $26,000 or $27,000 a year, and have the second \nmost dangerous job outside of mine workers in this country--undermine \ntheir ability to provide for themselves. And cutting back on the \nearned-income tax credit for those people that make $25,000 to $27,000 \nand are trying to provide for their children.\n  They oppose an increase in the minimum wage. Now they are doing it \nwith regard to a national law on the right to work, and they are also \ndoing it in terms of the TEAM Act. Can we look against that background \nand say, Oh, we have here a TEAM Act that really is in the interests of \nthose working families, when we have the solid record of what the \nmajority has been attempting to do to working families? You have a \ntough time convincing me of that, Mr. President. You have a tough time \nconvincing me of that. All we have to do is check and talk with working \nfamilies and we find out what those answers are.\n  Mr. President, I hope when the time comes that the TEAM Act would be \nrejected. I have admired the efforts of Senator Dorgan and others to \ntry and find some common ways they think this matter can be resolved. I \nunderstand that they are working on that particular measure. I, myself, \nam unconvinced that we ought to be doing anything at all in this \nparticular area. It is basically a problem that does not exist, but I \ncertainly want to listen further to my colleagues and friends who have \nbeen strong advocates for working families, and will continue to \nconsult with them.\n  I withhold the balance of our time.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I yield myself such time as I may use upon \nthe Dorgan amendment, and if I utilize all of that time, then I will \nuse time from the bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GORTON. The distinguished Senator from Massachusetts has talked \nabout the large number of proposals before the Senate in one form or \nanother, two of which will actually come to a vote sometime in the next \n24 or 48 hours. I will restrict my remarks to\n\n[[Page S7478]]\n\nthose two and will attempt to be relatively brief in connection with \neach.\n  First and foremost, because we will be voting on TEAM in an \nultimately final form and presumably sending it back to the House and I \nhope to the President of the United States, I wish to make a few \nremarks on the TEAM Act itself.\n  The Senator from Massachusetts, it seems to me, has two objections to \nthe TEAM Act which are not entirely consistent with one another. The \nfirst is that it is a terrible idea to allow labor-management \ncooperation outside of a formal union-management negotiating session; \nthat we are still, in America, in the position we were in the 1930's in \nwhich most people who work and most people who are employers or \nsupervisors regard themselves in polar opposite camps with antagonistic \nkinds of interests.\n  The second argument made by the Senator from Massachusetts seems, \nparadoxically, quite different and that argument is that there are so \nmany of these teams and so much cooperation going on at the present \ntime without any harassment being aimed at it, that we do not need this \nlegislation.\n  Mr. President, I think that both arguments are in error, as largely \ninconsistent as they may be. We live in a very different world than the \nworld faced by our predecessors who passed the National Labor Relations \nAct of 1935, in a quite different world than the only time in which \nmajor changes were made in that act in 1947.\n  By and large across this country, both labor and management realized \nthat management cannot be successful unless it has happy, productive, \nand committed employees, and that employees recognize they cannot be \nsuccessful unless their management, unless the company for which they \nare working, is itself successful. As a consequence, there is a far \ngreater feeling of community of interest today than there was at the \ntime of the passage of this act.\n  So what is it that the Senator from Massachusetts asks us to believe? \nHe asks us to believe that these interests are always antagonistic with \none another, that employers lust after the ability to do in their \nemployees in one way or another, largely by subterfuge. He speaks of a \nworld, Mr. President, that simply does not exist today, and he speaks \nabout a bill that is very, very short and quite plain in its meaning.\n  I can read for you the 10 lines of the bill that is before us that \ninclude the entire substance of the legislation, and it reads, and I \nquote.\n\n       . . . it shall not constitute or be evidence of an unfair \n     labor practice . . . for an employer to establish, assist, \n     maintain or participate in any organization or entity of any \n     kind, in which employees participate to address matters of \n     mutual interest (including issues of quality, productivity \n     and efficiency) and which does not have, claim or seek \n     authority to negotiate or enter into collective bargaining \n     agreements under this Act with the employer or to amend \n     existing collective bargaining agreements between the \n     employer and any labor organization.\n\n  That is it, Mr. President. That is all there is to it. People can get \ntogether voluntarily to solve problems without running afoul of the \nNational Labor Relations Act.\n  The Senator from Massachusetts has said in his argument you can only \nhave cooperation effectively with effective collective bargaining. But \nin the private sector, only 12 percent of all of the employees of this \ncountry have chosen to engage in formal collective bargaining through a \nlabor-management relationship.\n  The National Labor Relations Act protects the right of employees to \njoin unions and to bargain collectively. It also protects the right of \nemployees to say, ``We do not want to do it in this way.'' And 88 \npercent of all of our private sector employees have chosen the latter \ncourse of action. Yet, at one level, the Senator from Massachusetts \nsays they should not be allowed to do anything at all. Everything that \nis done is likely to be a subterfuge for a company-dominated union to \nget around the National Labor Relations Act itself, and at the other \nlevel he says, ``Oh, no, we can do it already.''\n  The problem is that the ability to continue to do what has grown up \nspontaneously all across this country is threatened by the actions of \nthe National Labor Relations Board and of the courts of the United \nStates.\n  All this proposal does is, in effect, to say you can keep on doing \nwhat you have been doing. You can deal with a number of matters of \ngeneral interest like quality, productivity, and efficiency, and, if we \npass the Kassebaum amendment, it will add to that health and safety as \nspecific subjects for such cooperation together with other alliances.\n\n  That is all it says. The Kassebaum amendment will make it even more \nclear that this does not undercut those labor-management agreements \nthat exist with respect to 12 percent of private sector employment \nwhich is covered by collective bargaining agreements at the present \ntime.\n  My question is: What are they afraid of? This is happening. It is \nthreatened. This bill will remove that threat. No one has to engage in \nthis kind of activity who does not wish to. Any group of employees who \nwish to join a union and operate under the National Labor Relations Act \nretains the right to do exactly that.\n  This is 1996, Mr. President. We have a far more cooperative attitude \ntoday. We need that more cooperative attitude to compete with the rest \nof the world. We need it for the increasing prosperity of our society, \nand this bill, with the Kassebaum amendment, will accomplish exactly \nthat goal.\n  We do not need to repeat the arguments of 1935. They are no longer \nrelevant. It is possible to do a job both for employees and employers \noutside of the specific strictures of the National Labor Relations Act. \nThat is what the TEAM Act proposes. That is why it ought to be passed.\n  I must say I do find myself in agreement with the Senator from \nMassachusetts on one of the other subjects that he brought up, and that \nhas to do with the cloture vote on a national right-to-work law, which \nwill also be voted on here. I intend, as he does, to vote against \ncloture on that proposition because I am, as he said he was--but I \nthink there is a little bit of disingenuousness in it--very much in \nfavor of the present law which says that each State can make its own \nchoice with respect to whether or not it will have a so-called right-\nto-work law on its books.\n  Twenty-three States have made such a choice. Twenty-six States have \nrejected such a choice. My own State is one of those 26 which has done \nso twice by referendum by a vote of the people of those States \nthemselves.\n  I believe that is precisely the correct balance in this highly \ncontroversial issue. I do not believe that the people of the State of \nWashington should govern the decision of the people of Wyoming in that \nconnection, or the people of Wyoming, the choices that are made by the \npeople of the State of Washington.\n  So I like the present law. I was delighted to hear it defended by the \nSenator from Massachusetts, except for the fact that during almost his \nentire career he has wanted to repeal the right of States to make that \nchoice. In other words, he may here today be defending States rights, \nbut, in fact, he wants to deprive the States of those rights and to say \nto a State that has chosen quite freely to pass a right-to-work law \nthat you do not have the privilege, you do not have the right to do so.\n  I think this is a matter of federalism. I think this is a matter \nwhich the people of each State should be permitted to choose for \nthemselves.\n  I, therefore, will vote against cloture, but I think as a result of a \nmore profound devotion to federalism that is, in fact, shown on this \nissue by the Senator from Massachusetts.\n  The really important issue, however, Mr. President, is, in fact, the \nTEAM Act. It is, in fact, confirming the right of both employees and \nemployers to do what they are already doing in 30,000 workplaces around \nthe country: to encourage others to do the same thing without \nundercutting the rights of any person who wishes to be a part of a \nlabor union whatsoever. In order to confirm those rights, we need to \npass the bill.\n\n  The bill reflects the real condition of our workplace today. The bill \npromotes effectiveness and the competitiveness in our workplace, and, \nperhaps equally significantly, it promotes the kind of cooperation that \nmakes work a more pleasurable as well as a more remunerative way in \nwhich the great majority of the working age population of\n\n[[Page S7479]]\n\nthe United States lives so many of its hours at the present time.\n  It is important that we pass it. I think it is significantly \nimportant that we pass the Kassebaum amendment. But it is one of the \nrewards of this long debate over minimum wage that we are not being \nsubjected to a filibuster on the TEAM Act but, in fact, are going to be \npermitted to express our views on it tomorrow. I look forward to its \npassage.\n  With that, Mr. President, seeing no one else desiring to speak, I \nsuggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Thomas). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the quorum be \ndivided equally with respect to time of each side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise to speak in strong support of the \nTEAM Act. I commend Senator Kassebaum, chairman of the Senate Labor and \nHuman Resources Committee, for bringing this bill out of committee and \nmaking it a high priority.\n  I think it is useful to begin with a review of why this legislation \nis necessary. Because the idea of employer-employee communication and \ncooperation seems so fundamental, it is astonishing to some people that \nthis measure must be debated at all let alone the fact that it is so \ncontroversial.\n  In 1992, the National Labor Relations Board issued a decision in the \nElectromation case which held that employer-employee committees to \ndiscuss workplace procedures and policies violated the National Labor \nRelations Act.\n  As a former union member, I understand full well the NLRA's \nprohibition on so-called company unions. But, the Board's decision in \nElectromation, which defines a ``quality circle'' or ``child care \ncenter feasibility committee'' or other form of employee-employer \ncommittee as a company union, misses the mark entirely.\n  It simply cannot be claimed at the NLRA was intended to outlaw every \ntype of employee-employer input mechanism. To state otherwise is to \nadvocate that workers can communicate with employers only through \nunions. Since when does the U.S. Government impose that kind of gag \nrule on American workers?\n  I can hardly believe that my colleagues on the other side are going \nalong with this twisted interpretation of labor law.\n  But, I suppose $35 million from the AFL-CIO could be a powerful \nincentive to grant organized labor such a special privilege at the \nexpense of the rank and file.\n  The TEAM Act does not--does not--authorize any employee committee or \ncooperative organization to engage in collective bargaining.\n  The TEAM Act does not--does not-affect any employee's right to join a \nunion. It should be noted that the TEAM Act applies to nonunion \nemployers.\n  So, what are some of the horrible things that employee-employer \ncommittees are barred from discussing?\n  It is illegal under Electromation from discussing free coffee for \nemployees. It is illegal to discuss the possibility of providing a soda \nmachine, microwave, or other furnishings for the employee lounge.\n  It is illegal to discuss tornado warning procedures or rules about \nfighting. It is illegal to discuss a ban on radios or the use of video \ngame machines. It is illegal to discuss rules about posters, drug and \nalcohol testing, dress codes, or a smelly propane buffer. It is illegal \nto discuss sponsoring a company softball team.\n  I cannot believe that there is a single Senator who would defend such \nobstruction to cooperation and employee input in decisionmaking. And, \nit seems pretty incongruous to me that an American institution that \nclaims to want to give workers a louder voice in their workplaces is \nleading the opposition.\n  It seems as if organized labor is afraid of empowering workers. It \nseems that organized labor does not want workers to have their own \nvoice. It seems that organized labor not only does not condone \nemployers who seek out workers' opinions on workplace issues, but also \ndemands that such openness continue to be punished by law.\n  Mr. President, there is really very little more to say about this \nmeasure. The TEAM Act, which would repair this ridiculous \ninterpretation of the National Labor Relations Act, is a good, \ncommonsense bill.\n  Once again, I want to extend my appreciation to Senator Kassebaum for \nher leadership on this issue. As one who has walked a mile in her \nmoccasins, I know just how confounding any change in labor policy can \nbe. I mean, good grief, the dollar threshold for the Davis-Bacon Act \nhas not been raised since 1931.\n  I urge all my colleagues to support this measure. And, I call on \nPresident Clinton to sign it into law.\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I rise today to offer my support to the \nTEAM Act. In my own State of Colorado, I have seen how beneficial the \nTEAM Act can be to both employers and employees. The reason for the \nsuccess is simple, the TEAM Act makes good sense. The act ensures that \nall employees have the right to be heard, thereby strengthening the \nhand of U.S. companies in competitive world markets. The TEAM Act does \nthis without hindering the rights of employees to choose union \nrepresentation or infringing on workplace safeguards that are already \nin place.\n  Any well-intentioned law can have harmful, unintended consequences. \nThe Team Act would rectify the unintended consequences of section \n8(a)(2) of the National Labor Relations Act to allow employees and \nmanagers to address issues such as scheduling, work assignments, health \nand safety, training, and work rules, all of which are now illegal \ntopics of discussion in nonunion workplaces.\n  The archaic provisions of section 8(a)(2) of the 1935 National Labor \nRelations Act are entirely out of step with modern management \ntechniques that are mutually beneficial to employers and employees. It \nis shocking to this Senator that employers and employees are not \nallowed, under the law, to sit down and discuss issues of importance to \nthem. A regulation designed to protect American workers has been \ntwisted to a purpose for which it was never intended. No law should \nprevent employees and employers from working together for the common \ngood of the employee and the company.\n  Management-labor cooperation makes a lot of sense. The people \nactually doing the work often have a better handle on the problems and \npossible solutions that can help American industry be much more \nproductive. The TEAM Act encourages workplace cooperation by involving \nthe employee in the decisionmaking process of the company. Active \nparticipation in discussions about quality, production, and other \nworkplace issues makes companies like Eastman Kodak in Windsor, CO, run \nmore smoothly and produce a better product.\n  If American companies are going to remain competitive, employers and \nemployees must work together to improve quality productivity, safety, \nand efficiency. Countries such as Japan and Sweden have already \nimplemented this practice of cooperation in the form of quality circles \nin which managers sit down with employees to plot strategy, improve \nquality and productivity, and discuss safety. To remain competitive on \nthe global market American companies and their employees need to be \nable to come together and discuss their concerns without fear of being \npenalized for violating the National Labor Relations Act.\n  Currently there are over 30,000 companies with workplace cooperative \nprograms. It is time to change an outdated law and let employers and \nworkers cooperate. It is my hope that we will pass the TEAM Act.\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM. I yield 10 minutes or such time as the Senator from \nVermont would need.\n\n[[Page S7480]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. I have come to speak on the TEAM Act. I do so because I \nfeel very strongly that there is a misunderstanding as to what we are \ndiscussing, the importance of it to this country, and that if we sat \nback and took a look at where we are and what we are talking about and \nunderstood the ramifications, there would be unanimous support for the \nTEAM Act.\n  I come to you with somewhat of a different perspective than some of \nmy colleagues. I earlier today supported the minimum wage. I am not one \nwho has anything but respect for the various positions of labor versus \nmanagement. Sometimes I am with one; sometimes I am with the other. On \nthis one, I am strongly in favor of doing what must be done to improve \nthis Nation's productivity, and that is what we are talking about \nhere--this Nation's productivity--for if there is no productivity, \nthere is no profit. If there is no profit, then there is nothing for \nthe workers and the management to split up for the owners and the \nstockholders.\n  So I come here as an original cosponsor of the TEAM Act because I \nbelieve that cooperation between employers and employees is the wave of \nthe future. Unfortunately, it has been the wave of the future for our \ncompetitors for some 40 years. We are behind. Why? The historical \nconfrontation and conflict models of industrial relations will not \nserve us in this 21st century, the models that were created in the \n1930's when we had industries taking advantage of workers, when it was \nnecessary for the workers to join together to fight for higher wages \nand to fight for their share of productivity. We now have a realization \nthat the processes we utilized in the 1930's are no longer relevant. \nThat was learned by our competitors many years ago.\n  I was a senior at Yale University back in the late 1950's, and at \nthat time we took a look at what needed to be done to improve \nproductivity and to improve how our Nation could meet the demands of \nthe future. Many suggestions were made. I remember writing my senior \nthesis, and I understood what needed to be done, in my own mind, in \norder to improve the productivity of this Nation.\n\n  At that time we were discussing innovative matters, such as workers \nand management getting together, learning how to split the profits \nthrough profit sharing, stock options, and all of these matters. It was \na fascinating time for academia. As we studied and put together \nimaginative ideas on how to improve productivity in the Nation, there \nwas just one problem. Nobody was listening, neither the management nor \nthe workers, for they were all still in the 1930's mode, wondering what \ncould be done as they fought each other to see who could get the \nadvantage over the other.\n  Who was listening? The Germans, the Japanese--the Asians, the \nEuropeans. What happened? If you look back now, you see such an \nunbelievable contrast of what the goals were in manufacturing, and what \nthe results were. Ours was, ``fight, fight, fight.'' And what happened? \nAs we went through the years, the relationships between management and \nworkers did not improve. In fact they got testier, they got worse. And \nin some cases, like the automobile industry, workers were in a \nsituation where they got tremendous advantages for themselves, but all \nof a sudden they were fighting the Japanese and Germans, and those \nautomobiles came in with much better quality. And what happened? We \nalmost lost the automobile industry.\n  Why? Because the Europeans and the Asians had understood, as we did \nnot at that time, that if the workers and management could sit down \nwith each other, could take a look at what their problems were that \nthey had to face, how they could improve quality, how they could work \nin order to improve productivity, could improve the profit, then they \ncould all sit down and have a better chance to make sure they were each \ntaken care of.\n  So, if you look back at what happened in this Nation, the \nrelationship between laborers and management has not improved. In fact, \nit has even gotten worse in many cases: ``fight, fight, fight.'' What \nhappened? If you take a look at the unions, our unions have gotten \nweaker. The union movement now is frustrated because it cannot organize \nthe companies. On the other hand, in Germany and in Japan the opposite \ntook place. They learned how to get together, concepts which are a \nlittle frightening to those who were worrying about communism in the \n1950's. ``My God, you cannot let workers and management get together.''\n  But they learned to improve their productivity and the way they did \nthings. When things were returned you went, not to the managers, you \nwent to the production line and said, ``How come all these parts came \nout this way?'' And the workers sat down and said, ``If we improve \nthis, we will have better quality and sell more.'' And then what \nhappens? You then argue over how you split the increase in \nproductivity.\n  If you examine the unions in Europe, what happened to them is, using \nthese concepts, they got stronger and stronger. And in Asia they got \nstronger and stronger. In fact, in Germany there are workers on the \nboards of directors. In Japan they had worked out work security \nagreements long before our workers did in this country. The main desire \nthere is to keep people employed, even sometimes at the expense of \nstockholders; even, sometimes, at the expense of corporate profits.\n  So there the unions, by working together with management toward a \ncommon goal, strengthened the union movement in those countries. In \nthis country what happened? We were still fighting against each other \nand were not worried about productivity.\n\n  So what has happened now? This kind of, fight, fight, fight, has \nresulted in weird decisions under the NLRB, saying you cannot even sit \ndown and do the most menial things without going through the whole \nprocess of unionization. We have some 30,000 businesses now that can be \nintimidated into doing something because, if they sit down and try to \nwork it out to improve productivity, they may have an action brought \nagainst them to stop them from working together, stop them from doing \nwhat is necessary to improve their business. They could get fined, they \ncould receive an injunction to prevent what ought to be done so they \ncan have more productivity, more profit to split among the stockholders \nand workers together.\n  So why in the world would we now say it is a bad idea to do what our \ncompetitors across the world have been doing, putting us out of \nbusiness, and we say we cannot sit down and work together without going \nthrough the whole unionization process? It may not be too late for us. \nBut it is such a simplistic thought, that it is a good idea for us all \nto sit down and figure out how we can change the production line to \nimprove the product, so we can sell more and then talk about an \nincrease in wages, instead of saying no, you cannot do that because \nthat may mean we are working too closely together.\n  If we work too closely together, my gosh, that is not good.\n  Why not?\n  Well, I don't know, but it was not good in the 1930's so it is \nprobably not good now.\n  We are not in the 1930's. Relationships between employees and \nemployers have changed dramatically in those areas where we figured out \nthe best way to work is to work together. We have shining examples in \nthis country, Motorola and others, who have learned how to compete, and \nto a certain extent the automobile industry, that has learned how to \ncompete. All it means is to learn to work together.\n  The TEAM Act means we can work together and improve everybody's \nlives. We can improve the safety, we can improve the productivity, and \nwe can improve the profit. Why in the world would you be against that? \nWhy? Because we are still in a mindset of the 1930's, which is long \ngone if you want to be a competitive business in this Nation.\n  So I urge my colleagues to forget a lot of the rhetoric they have \nheard and just think about the basics of business. That is, if we work \ntogether, management and labor can sit down and figure out how to \nimprove things, how to improve safety so we lower costs, how to improve \nthe quality of the things we produce so they are more salable--how we \ncan make sure we all have a better profit, a better business, a safer \nbusiness, so we can be healthier and happier. So why in the world can \nanybody be against the TEAM Act? I just do not know how.\n\n[[Page S7481]]\n\n  I am hopeful my colleagues will understand that this is incredibly \nimportant for the future of this Nation. For we are being driven out, \nin many cases, by our competitors, who understand that teamwork is the \nanswer to their future. I say we had better learn that lesson. And the \nway we are going to start learning it is pass the TEAM Act so those \nbusinesses that do understand what needs to be done can do it.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas.\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM. Mr. President, I want to express my appreciation to \nthe Senator from Vermont, who has been a stalwart supporter of this \nlegislation, for putting it in a historical perspective that helps us \nunderstand why it is important for us today, and relevant, to consider \nthe innovations that would help us establish an environment in the \nworkplace that will lend it great creativity.\n  Another stalwart supporter who has done much to enhance this \nlegislation and work with the business community is the Senator from \nMissouri. I yield him as much time as he desires from the Kassebaum \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. I thank the Senator from Kansas for her excellent work \nin helping us develop the capacity as Americans to be competitive and \nto be productive, and to maintain our standard of excellence around the \nworld.\n  There is no other nation that has the capacity, especially in areas \nof complexity, that the United States does, whether it is in \npharmaceuticals or just in technological industry--whether it be \ncomputers, software, or hardware, the United States is No. 1.\n  It comes as a result of the recognition of the importance of the \nhuman resource in the equation. You simply cannot be competitive \nwithout tapping every part of the resource that you have. When we think \nof this summer and the excitement that will surround the Olympic Games \nin Atlanta, it is unthinkable that we would send teams to Atlanta and \nforbid the coaches to talk to the players. What nonsense that would be, \nnot to allow a player to come off the field or off the court and say to \nthe coach: ``This is what they are doing. This is how we can make an \nadjustment to improve our performance, to make it possible for us to be \nwinners instead of losers.''\n  It is a fundamental recognition of the fact that the people on the \ncourt will have a different perspective than the people off the court. \nThe people on the field will have an awareness of how things are going \nthat is special, different, unique, and of value.\n  The same is true in industry. No matter how hard a compassionate \nmanager tries to observe the process from outside, no matter how well \nthe engineer from the design room tries to structure the environment \nfor productivity, the fellow who is actually on the floor is going to \nhave an ability to say, ``This doesn't work here. It may look good in \ntheory, but it doesn't work in practice.''\n  We need to tap the resources of the broad spectrum of individuals on \nthe American team for productivity in order to make sure that we \ncontinue to be winners, that we continue to forge a position for the \nUnited States which puts us at the top of complex industries, the most \nvaluable services and goods in the world, and gives us the opportunity \nto maintain a standard of living that makes America a great magnet.\n  Last I checked, people were still flocking to these shores. They were \nnot leaving here to go elsewhere. They were still coming here because \nof the great opportunities that exist, because of the way in which this \nculture recognizes the contribution that can be made by citizens \ngenerally.\n  I think that is what the TEAM Act is all about. It is about \nunderstanding and recognizing the tremendous resource that workers are, \nthat they can be to their own future by guaranteeing productivity and \nthereby ensuring job security, that they can be to the competitive \nposition of this country by outproducing and outworking and outthinking \nand outsmarting and outcooperating workers anyplace else in the world.\n  Most Americans would believe, and it is because we are commonsense \npeople, that it is OK for employees and employers to talk. If you would \nhave listened to the debate in this Chamber, you would have heard from \nthose on the other side of the aisle, ``Why, it's all right, it's all \nOK, it's perfectly legal right now. We don't need this.''\n  When they say it is perfectly legal now, we do not need this, it \nconfounds me that they have amendments to this. Why would they want to \nhave a substitute proposal for something that is perfectly OK? The \ntruth of the matter is, it is not perfectly OK.\n  Let me read from a list of things that have been ruled inappropriate \nfor nonunion employers to talk to their nonunion employees on. Let us \njust let the American people have an understanding of what the law is \nhere and whether it needs to be changed.\n  If you discuss the extension of the employees' lunch breaks by 15 \nminutes, that is illegal, from the case of Sertafilm and Atlas \nMicrofilming;\n  The length of the workday, to discuss how long each workday is going \nto be, that is illegal, from Weston & Brooker Co.;\n  A decrease in rest breaks from 15 minutes to 10 minutes, that is \nillegal to talk about with workers;\n  What paid holidays you have. The Singer Manufacturing case held that \nwas illegal to talk about;\n  The extension of store hours during the wheat harvest season. The \nDillon's company case said you cannot talk with workers about that to \nget their input.\n  Who are we trying to kid? Workers know what kind of break they need. \nWorkers know what kind of workday they would like to work. I know of \none plant in my home State that decided they wanted to work 4 days of \n10 hours a day instead of 5 days of 8 hours a day and have 3-day \nweekends every week. Why would Government stand between workers and \nmanufacturers, between managers and employees or their associates to \nsay you cannot discuss those things, and yet that is what the law is \nfor eight out of nine American workers, because eight out of nine \nAmerican workers are nonunion workers.\n  You see, this is something that is totally and perfectly all right \nfor union workers to talk with employers about. It is just not legal \naccording to the National Labor Relations Board for nonunion.\n  I could talk to you about other things. Safety labeling of electrical \nbreakers is wrong for the managers to talk to the employees about. I \nhope they go ahead and talk about it anyhow. They ought to.\n  Tornado warning procedures: Wrong, cannot talk about that.\n  Purchase of new lifting equipment for stock crew: Wrong.\n  Rules about fighting: Wrong.\n  Safety goggles for fryer and bailer operators: Wrong.\n  Wait a second. We do not want to rule out of the equation of American \nbusiness the contribution that employees can make to the safety and \nproductivity, to the efficiency, to the level of service. If the store \nworkers want to mention to the managers that we should stay open later \nduring the wheat harvest in the Great Plains of America, which turns \nout to be the bread basket for the world, it seems to me that we should \nnot make that against the law.\n  The sharpness of the edges of the safety knives: That is illegal to \ntalk about.\n  Pensions, profit-sharing plans, overtime pay: Cannot talk about that.\n  Oh, it is said that, ``Well, if you talk about those things, the \npeople will think you have a union when you don't. It will be a sham \nunion.'' Frankly, I do not underestimate the American worker that \nseverely.\n  Over the Fourth of July, over the break of the last 10 days, I went \nand worked in about five or six places in Missouri, actually on the job \nside by side with people. I never met a single worker who did not know \nwhether he or she was in a union. They know. Who are we trying to kid? \nWorkers know whether union dues are being deducted. They know whether \nthey are in a separate organization. It is not hard. This is not above \nthe capacity of the American worker. What strikes me is that the \nAmerican worker is bright.\n  I was involved in some jobs which I thought, looking from the \nsideline, might be easy or simple, and I found out that to do them \nwell, there were subtleties about how you did them,\n\n[[Page S7482]]\n\nthere were challenges, and the American workers develop those \ncapacities and those subtle efficiencies and they know how to put them \nin the system. They should be able to talk to managers about them.\n  The idea somehow that if we allow managers to talk to employees, \nemployees will be tricked into thinking they have a union when they do \nnot have a union is ludicrous. It underestimates the intelligence of \nthe American work force. American workers know, they know for sure, \nthey know surely whether or not they are in a union.\n  A second objection from the other side is, ``Well, maybe if we allow \npeople to talk, they will be just talking to certain employees who only \nhave limited views, and they will not reflect the views of employees \ngenerally.'' There is a safeguard. If there is an unfair system \nestablished where workers and employers are communicating with each \nother and it is working against the interests of the workers, it is \neasy. Workers have every right to unionize. They can form a labor \nunion. They can petition for a labor union. They can ask that unions \ncome in if they think it is unfair.\n  There is a structural guarantee of competition. If nonunion systems \nare not working well for employees, if these things are likely to be so \ndistorted or so unfair, nothing in this law, nothing in this proposal \nin any way derogates, undermines, erodes or otherwise lessens the right \nof a worker to petition for an election to organize or unionize a \nplant.\n  If the teams are unfair representatives or if they are shams or if \nthey are in some way defrauding or abusing the workers, it is clear \nthere is a remedy, and there is every incentive for employers and \ncompanies not to engage in that kind of activity, because this law does \nnothing, does absolutely nothing to change the right of workers to ask \nthat they be represented, if they choose to, by a union.\n  There are about 30,000 employers that would like to have such plans. \nWhy is it they would like to have such plans? Because they have seen \nthat when we work together we succeed. Strange to me, that is basically \na quote from President Clinton's State of the Union Address. He said, \nand I agree, and I quote, ``When companies and workers work as a team, \nthey do better, and so does America.''\n\n  The real truth of that matter is understood in the hearts and minds \nof everyone who has ever worked on a team, knowing that when you work \ntogether, you do better than when you work at odds with each other. Yet \nwe see this administration and its representatives in the Department of \nLabor opposing this opportunity, and they should not.\n  When I was Governor of the State of Missouri I had the opportunity to \nwork with companies. Like I do today, I would go and work on the \nassembly line. I would go and work with people to learn about their \njobs to see what was happening.\n  One of the companies that was hauled into the justice system of the \nLabor Department for cooperating with its employees was a company \ncalled EFCO Corp. It was a small company in Missouri, had about 60 \njobs. Now it has over 1,000 jobs. Much of its capacity was to increase \nits on-time deliveries, which went from the low seventies up into the \nhigh nineties, and which allowed workers to start working 4 days a week \ninstead of 5 days a week, get their 40 hours in in 4 days and have long \nweekends, spend more time with their kids, accommodate the demands of \ntheir families. It all came from these programs.\n  What was most distressing was that when EFCO wanted to be involved, \nit was said to have dominated its discussion groups or teams because \nthey provided employees with pencils and pens and allowed them to have \naccess to the financial records of the company. That was what the NLRB \nsaid was a violation.\n  You would say this company is bending over backward. It opens up the \nbooks to the workers and says: How can we do better for you and how can \nwe, as a team, do better, how can we as a company have the kind of \nperformance and productivity that will recommend us to the world? And \nindeed they are now a world-class company. But because they provided \nthe pens and pencils and they allowed the workers to have access to the \ncompany's financial records, the NLRB filed charges against the \ncompany. This is not the kind of thing that recommends America for \nleadership. It is the kind of thing that takes correction.\n  The ability of union workers to collaborate with employers is well \nensconced. It is fought for by the unions and protected by the \nemployers, recognized as a great benefit. But why should we limit that \ngreat benefit to 11 or 12 percent of our society, to the one out of \nnine workers in America that are in unions? Why not extend this benefit \nto all the workers in America saying that it is entirely appropriate \nfor nonunion workers, as well as union workers, to be involved in \ncollaborating and cooperating, in providing their good judgment of how \nbest to improve the situation for workers and to improve the \nproductivity and profitability of the business?\n  A great deal has been made by those who apparently resent this \npotential, saying how terrible it would be if the employer chose which \nworkers to talk to. Frankly, most employers want to get a good \nsampling. But it seems to me that what they want to do is impose a rule \nthat says there will be no talking at all for fear that someone might \nchose the wrong person with whom to talk. It totally ignores the fact \nthat if there are really misrepresentations involved in the situation, \nthere is always the opportunity for those in the plant to ask that \nthere be a union certified. And that election would proceed under the \nnew law that has been proposed here just as readily as it does under \nthe old.\n\n  No. I do not think we would send our teams to Atlanta forbidding the \nplayers to talk to the coaches. We have too much sense to do that. No, \nI do not think that union companies are going to stop having team \ndiscussions between employees and the company owners and managers. They \nhave too much sense to do that. And, no, I do not think that this \nGovernment should stand between the owners of corporations and their \nmanagers and the employees who work hard and want to succeed and want \nto be productive and keep them from talking to each other, because I \nbelieve the American people have too much sense to do that.\n  I urge my colleagues to extend this benefit which now inures to the \nbenefit of one out of nine workers in America to the rest of the \nworking population. Let us give everyone an opportunity to contribute \nto a winning effort, to succeed. That will maintain America's position \nas the most productive and most profitable and most rewarding place, \nnot just for companies, but for citizens, not just for institutions, \nbut for individuals. It is in fact a reason that America continues to \ndraw people from around the globe. It is the fact that we have \nrecognized the worth and value of individuals. And for us to deny their \nvalue in a commercial setting would be a substantial error which we \nmust not make. Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas.\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM. I thank the Senator from Missouri for a very sincere \nand eloquent statement on a subject that he knows a great deal about. \nSenator Ashcroft as both a Governor of Missouri and a Senator from \nMissouri has spent a great deal of time, as he mentioned, working in \ndifferent companies around the State. He knows this issue well. He \nfeels very passionately and is dedicated to it. I value greatly his \nhelp with this legislation.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4438\n\n            (Purpose: To provide for a substitute amendment)\n\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM. Mr. President, I now send an amendment to the desk \nand ask for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Kansas [Mrs. Kassebaum] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 4438.\n\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that further \nreading of the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       Strike all after the first world insert the following:\n\n     1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Teamwork for Employees and \n     Managers Act of 1995''.\n\n[[Page S7483]]\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       (1) the escalating demands of global competition have \n     compelled an increasing number of employers in the United \n     States to make dramatic changes in workplace and employer-\n     employee relationships;\n       (2) such changes involve an enhanced role for the employee \n     in workplace decisionmaking, often referred to as ``Employee \n     Involvement'', which has taken many forms, including self-\n     managed work teams, quality-of-worklife, quality circles, and \n     joint labor-management committees;\n       (3) Employee Involvement programs, which operate \n     successfully in both unionized and nonunionized settings, \n     have been established by over 80 percent of the largest \n     employers in the United States and exist in an estimated \n     30,000 workplaces;\n       (4) in addition to enhancing the productivity and \n     competitiveness of businesses in the United States, Employee \n     Involvement programs have had a positive impact on the lives \n     of such employees, better enabling them to reach their \n     potential in the workforce;\n       (5) recognizing that foreign competitors have successfully \n     utilized Employee Involvement techniques, the Congress has \n     consistently joined business, labor and academic leaders in \n     encouraging and recognizing successful Employee \n     Involvement programs in the workplace through such \n     incentives as the Malcolm Baldrige National Quality Award;\n       (6) employers who have instituted legitimate Employee \n     Involvement programs have not done so to interfere with the \n     collective bargaining rights guaranteed by the labor laws, as \n     was the case in the 1930's when employers established \n     deceptive sham ``company unions'' to avoid unionization; and\n       (7) Employee Involvement is currently threatened by legal \n     interpretations of the prohibition against employer-dominated \n     ``company unions''.\n       (b) Purposes.--The purpose of this Act is--\n       (1) to protect legitimate Employee Involvement programs \n     against governmental interference;\n       (2) to preserve existing protections against deceptive, \n     coercive employer practices; and\n       (3) to allow legitimate Employee Involvement programs, in \n     which workers may discuss issues involving terms and \n     conditions of employment, to continue to evolve and \n     proliferate.\n\n     SEC. 3. EMPLOYER EXCEPTION.\n\n       Section 8(a)(2) of the National Labor Relations Act is \n     amended by striking the semicolon and inserting the \n     following: ``: Provided further, That it shall not constitute \n     or be evidence of an unfair labor practice under this \n     paragraph for an employer to establish, assist, maintain, or \n     participate in any organization or entity of any kind, in \n     which employees who participate to at least the same extent \n     practicable as representatives of management participate, to \n     address matters of mutual interest, including, but not \n     limited to, issues of quality, productivity, efficiency, and \n     safety and health, and which does not have, claim, or seek \n     authority to be the exclusive bargaining representative of \n     the employees or to negotiate or enter into collective \n     bargaining agreements with the employer or to amend existing \n     collective bargaining agreements between the employer and any \n     labor organization, except that in a case in which a labor \n     organization is the representative of such employees as \n     provided in section 9(a), this proviso shall not apply;''.\n\n     SEC. 4. LIMITATION ON EFFECT OF ACT.\n\n       Nothing in this Act shall affect employee rights and \n     responsibilities contained in provisions other than section \n     8(a)(2) of the National Labor Relations Act, as amended.\n\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM. Mr. President, the amendment that I am offering \nconforms the TEAM Act to the bill that was passed by the House of \nRepresentatives last fall. It just basically has three provisions that \nclarify the TEAM Act.\n  First, the amendment includes health and safety among those issues \nthat may be discussed by teams. The original TEAM Act states that teams \nmay discuss matters of mutual interest, including quality, productivity \nand efficiency issues. We always intended for teams to be able to \ndiscuss health and safety. Nevertheless, we wanted to make explicit \nthat health and safety could be a topic of discussion. The amendment \nmakes this clarification.\n  Second, the amendment specifically limits the TEAM Act's safe harbor \nto nonunion settings. Despite a construction clause in section 4 of the \nbill that should have assured organized labor that firms could not use \nteams to bypass a union, organized labor somehow apparently still \nbelieves that teams will undermine unions. That is not the case. \nNevertheless, we make it abundantly clear that we do not intend teams \nto undermine unions and we state in plain English that the TEAM Act's \nsafe harbor only applies to nonunion settings.\n  Finally, the amendment states that teams have equitable participation \nby workers and managers. The purpose of this provision is to clarify \nthat workers may raise issues for discussion just as managers may raise \nissues as well. This is not meant to be a rigid formula for \nparticipation in the teams. It is simply meant to promote open dialog \nin teams. Many unionized workplaces suffer from an ``us-versus-them'' \nattitude, and we do not want teams to suffer the same problem.\n  This has been my concern with the amendment that was offered earlier \nby the Senator from North Dakota. There is a specificity and a rigidity \nwritten into the amendment that does not allow for the flexibility that \nI think Senator Ashcroft spoke to with much clarity and eloquence.\n  Those are the main provisions of the substitute amendment that I am \nintroducing.\n  For a point of clarification, Mr. President, I ask how much time is \nleft on the Kassebaum amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There are 14 minutes and 10 seconds remaining.\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM. On my side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Yes. And 30 minutes on the other side.\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM. I appreciate that. I think that the Senator from \nVermont wishes to speak again. I yield to him now however much time he \nwants out of that remaining time that is left. I yield to Senator \nJeffords.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont has 14 minutes \nremaining.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I am a cosponsor of the TEAM Act because \nI believe that cooperation between the employers and employees is \ncritical to our future. The historical confrontation and conflict model \nof industrial relations will not serve us in the 21st century. Over \n30,000 American companies use employer-employee involvement programs.\n  The TEAM Act addresses the concern that the National Labor Relations \nBoard will discourage future efforts at labor-management cooperation. \nSpecifically, in the Electromation decision, the NLRB held that \nemployer-employee action committees that involved workers meeting with \nmanagement to discuss attendance problems, no-smoking rules, and \ncompensation issues constituted unlawful company dominated \nunions. Senator Ashcroft went through a whole list of items which \nobviously should not have raised the concern of the NLRB.\n\n  Congress enacted section 8(a)(2) of the National Labor Relations Act \nforbidding employer domination of labor organizations, to eliminate the \nsham unions of the early 1930's. That was an appropriate and necessary \nact. The TEAM Act is a direct recognition that the world of work has \nchanged since the 1930's, as I stated earlier. In that era, many in \nAmerican business believed that success could be achieved without \ninvolving workers' minds along with their bodies. Today, recognition is \nwidespread among business executives that employee involvement from the \nshop floor to the executive suite is the best way to succeed.\n  The employee involvement efforts protected by the TEAM Act are not \nintended to replace existing or potential unions--not intended. In \nfact, the language of the bill specifically prohibits this result. That \nis why it is hard for me to concede that the opposition has any merit.\n  The legislation allows employers and employee to meet together to \naddress issues of mutual concern, including issues relating to quality, \nproductivity, and efficiency. However, those efforts are limited by \nlanguage that prohibits the committees or other joint programs from \nengaging in collective bargaining or holding themselves out as being \nempowered to negotiate or to modify collective bargaining agreements. \nIt is very clear, that sets the line, you cannot do what the unions are \nworried about.\n  Mr. President, the essence of the matter is the definition of a labor \norganization under the NLRA is so broad that whenever employers and \nemployees get together to discuss such issues, that act arguably \ncreates a labor organization. In that situation, the existing language \nof section 8(a)(2) comes into play and the question becomes whether the \nemployer has done anything to dominate or support that labor \norganization. It takes very little for an employer to be found to have \nviolated section 8(a)(2).\n  In prior debates, my Democratic colleagues have disputed whether such\n\n[[Page S7484]]\n\ndomination and support can be as little as providing meeting rooms or \npencils and papers for the discussions. However, it is clear that at \npresent no employer can be 100 percent certain that its dealings with a \nteam comply with the law. The standard is simply too unclear. Thus, we \nhave this bill before the Senate.\n  In our earlier debate on this issue, I heard Senator Kennedy state \nthat upwards of 80 percent of American companies are engaging in some \nform of teamwork or other cooperative workplace programs. His \nconclusion was that all this activity is taking place now without a \nchange in the law, so there is no need to change the law. However, what \nthat argument misses, Mr. President, is the fact that much of this \nactivity is a technical violation of existing law.\n  While these programs may be doing wonders for the productivity of the \ncompanies where they are employed, any of them are no more than a phone \ncall away from running afoul of the NLRA. What this does is places the \nunions in a position of intimidation, to try and force organization \nwhere they may not be able otherwise to get it.\n  It is no defense to an unfair labor practice charge that the program \nis working, that working conditions and productivity have improved, or \nthat the company's bottom line has risen. None of that matters. If it \nis a technical violation of the antiquated rule, the NLRB will shut \ndown the work team, fine the company, and force it to sign papers \nswearing never to do it again. The TEAM Act would prevent the \ncontinuation of these absurd results. That is all we are asking for \nhere.\n\n  I recently was visited by a workplace team from my own State of \nVermont. I am certain many of my colleagues in the Senate have had \nsimilar visits. There are successful teams operating throughout the \ncountry. That is the way it should be. We should keep it that way. The \nworkers who visited me were from the IBM computer-chipmaking facilities \nin Burlington, VT. The more traditional top-down management style still \nprevails in most shifts and in most departments in that plant. However, \non the night shift at this plant, the workers decided about 3 years ago \nto try a cooperative work team. They chose the name WENOTI for their \ngroup. That name is a combination of the words ``we, not I,'' to \nsymbolize their focus on what is good for all, not just what is good \nfor one.\n  When the team representatives came to my office a few months ago, \nthey were as proud a group of employees as I have ever seen. The WENOTI \nteam consistently leads the plant in all productivity and quality \ncontrol measures. Moreover, they told me that their job satisfaction \nhas risen directly to the relationship of their ability to contribute \nmeaningfully to the successful completion of their jobs. They were \nparticipating, and they were seeing results.\n  IBM is a profitmaking organization, and it is not promoting employee \ninvolvement solely out of altruism, but, rather, IBM has come to the \nrealization that employee involvement is vital to the company's bottom \nline. Doing so has the added dividend of giving employees a greater \nstake and a greater satisfaction in their job. Time and again, you hear \nemployees praise companies that do not ask them to check their brains \nat the door.\n  So if affected employers and employees support this legislative \neffort, what is the problem? It comes as no great surprise that \norganized labor takes a dim view of it. Oddly enough, to do so, it also \nmust take a dim view of the American worker.\n  Organized labor's arguments are based on the assumption that workers \nare not smart enough to know the difference between a sham union and a \ngenuine effort to involve them in a cooperative effort to improve a \nproduct, improve the productivity, improve the profit, and hopefully, \nand most likely what will occur, enhance the ability of workers to see \nincreased pay and benefits in their job.\n  In fact, Mr. President, the evil that section 8(a)(2) of the NLRA was \ndesigned to prevent was employees being fooled into thinking a union \nwas in the plant to represent their interests when, in reality, it had \nbeen set up by the employer to act in the company's best interests. \nEmployers may have been able to get away with that behavior in the \n1930's when this provision was written, but I think today's workers are \nsmarter and better informed than ever before. I think that is exactly \nwhy the employers are trying to harness their brains as well as their \nbacks, and in the modern-day work force, the need for brains is greater \nevery day.\n  Section 8(a)(2) needs to be amended to reflect the reality of today's \nwork force. That is all that this bill is trying to do.\n  The real problem for unions is, under current law, they have a \nmonopoly on employee involvement. Like the AT or the Vermont \nRepublican Party of old, nobody likes to lose their monopoly. But \nconsumers or voters or workers profit from choices in competition, not \nfrom a static response to a changing environment.\n  This is clearly the trend of the future. We should not allow an \noutmoded interpretation of law written for an early era get in the way \nof this Congress. I urge my colleagues to support the TEAM Act. I urge \nthem to protect the future of this Nation by allowing us to be \ncooperative and to be productive in the world's economy so we can \ncontinue our domination in the world economy.\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM. Mr. President, I appreciate very much the efforts of \nSenator Jeffords over a long period of time. He has been valuable in \ncommittee as well as making a case on the floor. I thank him.\n  The Senator from Virginia [Mr. Warner] desires to speak. Until he is \nhere, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Gorton). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 4437, As Modified\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, on behalf of Senator Dorgan, I send this \nmodification of this amendment to the desk.\n  The amendment (No. 4437), as modified, is as follows:\n\n       Strike all after the word ``SHORT'' on page 2, line 1, and \n     insert the following:\n\n     TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Teamwork for Employees and \n     Management Act of 1995''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       (1) the escalating demands of global competition have \n     compelled an increasing number of American employers to make \n     dramatic changes in workplace and employer-employee \n     relationships;\n       (2) these changes involve an enhanced role for the employee \n     in workplace decisionmaking, often referred to as ``employee \n     involvement'', which has taken many forms, including self-\n     managed work teams, quality-of-worklife, quality circles, and \n     joint labor-management committees;\n       (3) employee involvement structures, which operate \n     successfully in both unionized and non-unionized settings, \n     have been established by over 80 percent of the largest \n     employers of the United States and exist in an estimated \n     30,000 workplaces;\n       (4) in addition to enhancing the productivity and \n     competitiveness of American businesses, employee involvement \n     structures have had a positive impact on the lives of those \n     employees, better enabling them to reach their potential in \n     their working lives;\n       (5) recognizing that foreign competitors have successfully \n     utilized employee involvement techniques, Congress has \n     consistently joined business, labor, and academic leaders in \n     encouraging and recognizing successful employee involvement \n     structures in the workplace through such incentives as the \n     Malcolm Baldrige National Quality Award;\n       (6) employers who have instituted legitimate employee \n     involvement structures have not done so to interfere with the \n     collective bargaining rights guaranteed by the labor laws, as \n     was the case in the 1930s when employers established \n     deceptive sham ``company unions'' to avoid unionization; and\n       (7) the prohibition of the National Labor Relations Act \n     against employer domination or interference with the \n     formation or administration of a labor organization has \n     produced uncertainty and apprehension among employers \n     regarding the continued development of employee involvement \n     structures.\n       (b) Purposes.--It is the purpose of this Act to--\n       (1) protect legitimate employee involvement structures \n     against governmental interference;\n       (2) preserve existing protections against deceptive, \n     coercive employer practices; and\n       (3) permit legitimate employee involvement structures where \n     workers may discuss issues involving terms and conditions of \n     employment, to continue to evolve and proliferate.\n\n[[Page S7485]]\n\n     SEC. 3. LABOR PRACTICES.\n\n       Section 8 of the National Labor Relations Act (29 U.S.C. \n     158) is amended by adding at the end thereof the following \n     new subsection:\n       ``(h)(1) The following provisions shall apply with respect \n     to any employees who are not represented by an exclusive \n     representative pursuant to section 9(a) of 8(f):\n       ``(A) It shall not constitute or be evidence of an unfair \n     labor practice under section 8(a)(2) for an employer to meet \n     with the employees as a group, or to meet with each of the \n     employees individually, to share information, to brainstorm, \n     or receive suggestions or opinions from individual employees, \n     with respect to matters of mutual interest, including matters \n     relating to working conditions.\n       ``(B) It shall not constitute or be evidence of an unfair \n     labor practice under section 8(a)(2) for an employer to \n     assign employees to work units and to hold regular meetings \n     of the employees assigned to a work unit to discuss matters \n     relating to the work responsibilities of the unit. The \n     meetings, may, on occasion, include discussions with respect \n     to the conditions of work of the employees assigned to the \n     unit.\n       ``(C) It shall not constitute or be evidence of an unfair \n     labor practice under section 8(a)(2) for an employer to \n     establish a committee composed of employees of the employer \n     to make recommendations or determinations on ways of \n     improving the quality of, or method of producing and \n     distributing, the employer's product or service and to hold \n     regular meetings of the committee to discuss matters relating \n     to the committee. The meetings may, on occasion, include \n     discussions with respect to any directly related issues \n     concerning conditions of work of the employees.\n       ``(2) The provisions of paragraph (1) shall not apply if--\n       ``(A) a labor organization is the representative of the \n     employees as provided in section 9(a);\n       ``(B) the employer creates or alters the work unit or \n     committee during any organizational activity among the \n     employer's employees or discourages employees from exercising \n     the rights of the employees under section 7;\n       ``(C) the employer interferes with, restrains, or coerces \n     any employee because of the employee's participation in or \n     refusal to participate in discussions with respect to \n     conditions of work, which otherwise would be permitted by \n     subparagraphs (A) through (C) of paragraph (1); or\n       ``(D) an employer establishes or maintains a group, unit, \n     or committee authorized by subparagraph (A), (B), or (C) of \n     paragraph (1) that discusses conditions of work of employees \n     who are represented under section 9 without first engaging in \n     the collective bargaining required by this Act.\n       ``(3) An employee who participates in a group, unit, or \n     committee described in subparagraph (A), (B), or (C) of \n     paragraph (1) shall not be considered to be a supervisor or \n     manager because of the participation of the employee in the \n     group, unit, or committee.''.\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I wanted to just speak briefly on the \nmeasure that is before us. I see other Senators who want to address the \nSenate this evening. So I will only take a few moments.\n  But during the course of the discussion about what is legitimate and \nwhat is not legitimate, under existing laws there are a number of items \nthat were raised, most of which were raised in a previous debate and \ndiscussion on the TEAM Act. We asked the General Counsel of the \nNational Labor Relations Board to make a comment on them.\n  I ask unanimous consent that his complete letter to me be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                  U.S. Government,\n\n\n                               National Labor Relations Board,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, May 14, 1996.\n     Hon. Edward M. Kennedy,\n     Senator, U.S. Senate, Committee on Labor and Human Resources, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Kennedy: This is in response to your request \n     of May 11, 1966 for my assessment of the accuracy of certain \n     claims concerning the proper interpretation of Section \n     8(a)(2) of the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA) with \n     reference to S. 295 (the ``Team Act''). As General Counsel of \n     the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB), it is my \n     responsibility to investigate alleged violations of the NLRA \n     and prosecute meritorious claims. The responses to the \n     questions you posed set out below are based on my considered \n     judgment of the proper interpretation of Board cases. They \n     constitute my view of the applicable law, as General Counsel, \n     and do not constitute an opinion of the Board or its \n     individual members.\n       1. An organization whose purpose is to deal with an \n     employer to discuss quality, productivity, and efficiency \n     would not constitute a labor organization, provided it did \n     not also deal with the employer concerning grievances, labor \n     disputes, wages, rates of pay, hours, or working conditions, \n     or exist in part for such purposes.\n       Assuming the employee organization did deal with the \n     employer concerning working conditions and thus constituted a \n     labor organization, the employer would not ``dominate'' such \n     an organization simply by providing it with office supplies \n     and meeting space. ``Domination'' is typically found where an \n     employer exercises a strong influence over the organization, \n     by such actions as initiating the committee, presiding over \n     meetings, selecting the employee representatives, or \n     selecting the topics to be discussed. See Electromation, \n     Inc., 309 NLRB 990, 995 (1992), enfd., 35 F.2d 1148 (7th Cir. \n     1994).\n       The NLRB has also made it clear that an employer would not \n     violate Section 8(a)(2)'s proscription on providing unlawful \n     ``support'' to a labor organization simply by providing a \n     meeting room or office supplies, provided it did not do so in \n     the context of other acts of domination, interference, or \n     support of the organization. Keeler Brass Co., 317 NLRB 1110 \n     (1995); Electromation, 309 NLRB at 998 n. 31; Duquesne \n     University, 198 NLRB 891, 891 & n. 4 (1972). See, for \n     example, Sunnen Products, Inc., 189 NLRB 826 (1971)\n       2. A ``labor organization'' under the NLRA is a body in \n     which employees participate and deal with the employer \n     concerning ``grievances, labor disputes, wages, rates of pay, \n     hours of employment, or conditions of work.'' Discussions of \n     quality, productivity and efficiency do not necessarily \n     constitute dealing with the employer on conditions of \n     employment within the statutory definition.\n       3. The NLRA does not authorize the NLRB to fine companies \n     for violating the NLRA. The appropriate remedy for a \n     violation of Section 8(a)(2) would require the employer to \n     cease any unlawful assistance to or disestablish an \n     unlawfully dominated organization and reestablish the status \n     quo ante.\n       4. Talking to employees does not constitute dealing. The \n     NLRB has made clear that nothing in the NLRA prevents an \n     employer from encouraging its employees, for example, to \n     become more aware of safety problems in their work, or from \n     seeking suggestions and ideas from its employees. Therefore, \n     brainstorming groups, whose purpose is simply to develop a \n     range of ideas, are not engaged in dealing. Similarly, a \n     committee that exists for the purpose of sharing information \n     with the employer, but makes no proposals to the employer, is \n     not ordinarily engaged in dealing. E.I DuPont & Co., 311 NLRB \n     893, 894, 897 (1993).\n       Dealing requires a pattern or practice whereby employees \n     make proposals to management and management responds to those \n     proposals. Where there is no dealing, there is no labor \n     organization and, therefore, no unlawful domination of a \n     labor organization. Of course, where the employees are \n     represented by a collective bargaining agent, the employer is \n     required to discuss bargainable matters through the \n     representative.\n       5. Nothing in the NLRA prohibits employees from talking to \n     their employer about tornado warning procedures. Talking to \n     employees does not constitute dealing between employees and \n     their employer. The NLRB's decision in Dillon Stores, 319 \n     NLRB No. 149 (1995), does not hold that it is illegal for \n     workers to talk with their employers about tornado warning \n     procedures. That case held that the employer unlawfully \n     dominated employee committees that presented to management \n     proposals and grievances on virtually every possible aspect \n     of the employment relationship. Although at one meeting there \n     was a question and answer about tornado warning procedures, \n     that topic was wholly peripheral to the NLRB's decision. The \n     decision does not describe the nature of the question or \n     answer. Nor does it even remotely suggest that that exchange \n     was relevant to the finding that the committee existed for \n     the purpose of dealing with the employer in that case, or \n     that any discussion about that subject would necessarily \n     constitute dealing, or be impermissible.\n       6. Nothing in the NLRA prevents employers from seeking \n     suggestions and ideas from employees. Therefore, it does not \n     prevent an employer from seeking such input from employees \n     about how to settle a fight among employees.\n       7. Nothing in the Act prohibits an employer from talking to \n     employees, who are not represented by a union, about \n     extending lunch breaks. As already discussed, talking to \n     employees does not constitute dealing.\n       The NLRB's decision in Atlas Microfilming Division of \n     Sertafilm, Inc. 267 NLRB (1983), enfd. 753 F.2d 313 (3d Cir. \n     1985), is not to the contrary. That case did not involve a \n     violation of Section 8(a)(2) of the NLRA, nor did the NLRB \n     find that an employer could not discuss extending the lunch \n     hour with unrepresented employees. There, the NLRB found that \n     the employer violated Section 8(a)(5) and (1) of the NLRA by \n     unilaterally extending the lunch break an additional 15 \n     minutes, at a time when the employer had an obligation to \n     bargain with a union that was the exclusive representative of \n     the employer's employees.\n       8. It is not illegal for an employer to have a dialog with \n     his employees about flexible work schedules. Where employees \n     are simply providing information or ideas, rather than making \n     proposals as part of a pattern or practice of making \n     proposals, there is not dealing between the employees and the \n     employer. Further, where employees seek to make proposals in \n     the context of an organization over which they have control, \n     there is no unlawful employer domination of organization.\n       The NLRB's decision in Weston & Broker Co. 154 NLRB 747,763 \n     (1965), enfd. 373 F.2d 741 (14th Cir. 1967), did not make it \n     against the\n\n[[Page S7486]]\n\n     law for employees to discuss working arrangements with their \n     employers. The employer in that case did not attempt to \n     discuss work arrangements with employees. Rather, in that \n     case, the employer unilaterally changed employees' hours of \n     employment, without providing notice to the union \n     representing the employees, or bargaining with the union, and \n     it was those actions that the NLRB found to be a violation of \n     the employer's obligation to bargain under Section 8(a)(5) of \n     the NLRA.\n       9. It is not illegal for an employer to seek input from \n     employees concerning improving productivity. An employer is \n     prohibited only from dominating, interfering with, or \n     supporting a labor organization. A labor organization is one \n     that exists in whole or in part for the purpose of dealing \n     with employers concerning grievances, labor disputes, wages, \n     rates of pay, hours of employment or conditions of work, as \n     set out in Section 2(5) of the NLRA. When discussions about \n     productivity do not implicate the subjects listed in the \n     statutory definition of labor organization, Section 8(a)(2) \n     of the NLRA is inapplicable. See Vons Grocery Company 320 \n     NLRB No. 5 (December 18, 1995) (employee participation group \n     devoted to considering specific operational concerns and \n     problems did not have a pattern or practice of making \n     proposals to management on subjects listed in Section \n     2(5), and therefore was not a labor organization).\n       10. An employer can talk to employees about matters such as \n     day care centers, softball teams, the employee lounge, \n     vacations, dress codes, and parking regulations. Employees \n     can provide information or ideas without engaging in dealing \n     under the NLRA. Further, employees can made proposals through \n     an organization, to which the employer may respond, where the \n     employees have control of the structure and function of the \n     organization.\n       I reiterate that these responses represent only my \n     considered judgment of the applicability of Board precedent \n     to the questions you pose.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   Fred Feinstein,\n                                                  General Counsel.\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, Senators have pointed to the recent \nadministrative law judge decision relating to the Polaroid Corp. as an \nexample of what is wrong with the National Labor Relations Act. I \ndisagree with those Senators. Polaroid illustrates what is right with \nthe NLRA and wrong with the TEAM Act.\n  In Polaroid the employer created something it called the Employee \nOwners Influence Council to replace the Polaroid's Employees' Committee \nwhich the employer unilaterally disbanded. Polaroid got rid of the \ncommittee when advised that the committee was a labor organization \nwhose officers, under the Landrum-Griffin Act, must be elected. \nPolaroid's CEO unilaterally disbanded the Employees' Committee because \nhe believed that a companywide election would be disruptive, divisive, \nand contrary to the collaborative heritage that we value at Polaroid.\n  When he disbanded the Employees Committee, the CEO expressed concern \nthat this could leave a vacuum in the company and could lead to a union \norganizing drive. Polaroid therefore set about to create an alternative \nstructure that would be compatible with our corporate values. The \nadministrative law judge found that in creating this structure, \nPolaroid was motivated in part by its opposition to any union, or union \nnot dominated by the company and by its concern that in the absence of \na company dominated structure, the resulting void might leave an \nopening for such unwanted union.\n  Polariod selected the members of the Employee Owners Influence \nCouncil, controlled the agenda and established all the ground rules for \nits proceedings. Polaroid made clear to the employees, as the ALJ \nfound, that if they wished to have any voice in shaping company policy \nand practices they had best do so through the mechanism of EOIC.\n  Polariod sought to circumvent Sec. 8(a)(2) in creating the EOIC by \ntransparent artifices. The members of the EOIC were told that they \nreflected, but did not represent the views of other employees--although \nthey could report on what I have heard. The members of the EOIC \nlikewise were told not to make recommendations, although they could \nrespond to company proposals. And the members of the EOIC did not \narrive at majority decisions, although polls were taken of the EOIC \nmembers. The ALJ had no trouble seeing through these word games and \nfound that the EOIC was, in fact, an employee representation committee.\n  In sum, the Council at issue in Polaroid was unlawful because it \nviolated the core purpose of Sec. 8(a)(2): it deprived employees of the \nopportunity to determine for themselves how they wish to be represented \nand to choose their own representatives and substituted, instead, an \nemployer controlled system of employee representation. S. 295 would, \nindeed, allow such employer domination. That is why S. 295 should be \ndefeated.\n  Mr. President, I would like to just very quickly mention for the \nMembers some of the items that were brought up during this afternoon \nand that had been brought up previously, and his response to them.\n  The NLRB has made it clear that employers would not violate section \n8(a)(2)'s proscription on providing unlawful support to a labor \norganization simply by providing a meeting room or office supplies, \nprovided it did not do so in the context of other acts of domination, \ninterference, or support of the organization.\n  The issue about employers talking to their employees about matters of \nmutual interest, and talking to employees, does not constitute dealing. \nThe NLRB has made clear that nothing in the NLRA prevents an employer \nfrom encouraging its employees, for example, to become more aware of \nsafety programs in their work, or from seeking suggestions and ideas \nfrom employees.\n\n       Therefore brainstorming groups whose purpose is simply to \n     develop a range of ideas are not engaged in dealing. \n     Similarly, a committee that exists for purposes of sharing \n     information with the employer but makes no proposal to the \n     employer is not ordinarily engaged in dealing.\n       Nothing in the NLRA prohibits employees from talking to \n     their employer about tornado warning procedures. Talking to \n     employees does not constitute dealing with employees and \n     their employer.\n\n  That issue was raised this afternoon as well.\n\n       Nothing in the NLRA prevents employers from seeking \n     suggestions and ideas from employees. Therefore it does not \n     prevent an employer from seeking such input from employees in \n     how to settle a fight among employees.\n\n  That was suggested to be illegal.\n\n       Nothing in the Act prohibits an employer from talking to \n     employees who are not represented by a union about extending \n     lunch breaks. As already discussed, talking to employees does \n     not constitute dealing.\n\n  I believe that that activity was suggested as violating the law.\n\n       It is not illegal for an employer to have a dialog with his \n     employees about flexible work schedules. Where employees are \n     simply providing information or ideas, rather than making \n     proposals as part of a pattern or practice of making \n     proposals, there is no dealing between the employees and the \n     employer. Further, where employees seek to make proposals in \n     the context of an organization over which they have control, \n     there is no unlawful employer domination of that \n     organization.\n\n  The NLRB's decision in Weston & Brooker did not make it against the \nlaw for employees to discuss working arrangements with their employers. \nThe employer in that case did not attempt to discuss work arrangements \nwith employees. Rather, in that case, the employer unilaterally changed \nemployees' hours of employment without providing notice to the union \nrepresenting the employees, or bargaining with the union, and it was \nthose actions that the NLRB found to be a violation of the employer's \nobligation to bargain under section 8(a)(5) of the NLRA.\n  There has been references to that earlier in the afternoon. It is \nimportant to put it in perspective, and I believe this comment does.\n\n       It is not illegal for an employer to seek input from \n     employees concerning improving productivity. An employer is \n     prohibited only from dominating, interfering with, or \n     supporting a labor organization. A labor organization is one \n     that exists in whole or in part for the purposes of dealing \n     with employers concerning grievances, labor disputes, wages, \n     rates of pay, hours of employment or conditions of work, as \n     set out in section 2(5) of the NLRA. Where discussions about \n     productivity do not implicate the subjects listed in the \n     statutory definition of labor organization, section 8(a)(2) \n     is inapplicable.\n\n  Mr. President, I include the whole letter. It is a very good \nstatement. What we have tried to do is to take a number of the \nquestions that were raised during earlier debate by a number of our \ncolleagues and asked for an explanation and for an understanding by the \nchief counsel as to the conditions of the law. I think if people take \nthe time to review the letter and put it against what has been \nsuggested they would have a clearer idea.\n  Finally, I come back, Mr. President, to say, as I mentioned from our \nprevious charts earlier today, we have, No.\n\n[[Page S7487]]\n\n1, seen where this kind of cooperation is taking place in 30,000 \nbusinesses across the country. The number of cases that have been \nbrought each year is virtually a handful. This is not a problem. What \nwe are doing with, I believe, with the consideration of the TEAM Act is \nthat rather than get involved in cooperative kinds of endeavors, it is \nonly going to provide increasing kinds of tension.\n  When the employers know their rights and the employees know their \nrights and they are able to work that out, then we have an increasing \nunderstanding and increasing productivity. When you have exploitation \nof one side by the other, you have tension and lack of cooperation. We \nfind that today there is that increasing cooperation and we support \nthat and believe that that ought to be the case. But we are strongly \nopposed to the idea that under the label of cooperation or some idea of \n``team,'' we are going to substitute carefully selected employees by \nthe employers to be the effective negotiators for employees in the \nareas of conditions and wages. That is stated not to be the purpose of \nit. If it is not the purpose of it, I do not believe this legislation \nis really needed, and for those reasons and reasons outlined earlier in \nthe day I hope the legislation would not be approved.\n\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas.\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM. I would respectfully disagree with the ranking member \nof the Labor and Human Resources Committee; there is a problem. And \nwhile there may be only 1 case out of 1,000 perhaps that is a problem, \nit has, as I have said earlier, a chilling effect. And the example I \ngave this afternoon was of the Polaroid decision which was in June and \nwas I think an enormous problem and an example of the effect and \ninfluence on everyone.\n  Point of inquiry. How much time is remaining for my amendment, or on \nmy side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There are 3 minutes 2 seconds.\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM. I yield to the senior Senator from Virginia that \namount of time plus any leader time he would desire.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, plus what other time?\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM. Any amount of leader time----\n  Mr. WARNER. I thank the Senator.\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM. The Senator from Virginia desires.\n  Mr. WARNER addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. I am here as, I believe, one of the strongest supporters \nof this proposed legislation. I am privileged to serve on the Small \nBusiness Committee. Chairman Bond and others had hearings at which I \nparticipated.\n  Mr. President, before the distinguished Senator from Massachusetts \nleaves the floor, I wonder if I might ask him a question on my time.\n  Mr. President, in the course of the hearing before the Committee on \nLabor, chaired by the distinguished Senator from Kansas and the \ndistinguished Senator from Massachusetts as the ranking member, I put \nforth the suggestion that I find this proposed legislation a first \ncousin to the suggestion box which is found in industrial plants and \noffices all across America. I have great difficulty in trying to \ndetermine, if you can drop a written suggestion in the box, why can't \none or two employees verbally suggest to their employers--whether it \nis, say, a day care center or needed improvements in the restaurant--\nwhy can they not do that and then help the employer implement it? It \nseems to me so elementary.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I respond, they cannot only do it but \nthey do much more in the 30,000 businesses across the country that the \nmajority report mentions. If you take the State of Washington and the \nState of Oregon, the two clearest States, they have been able to save \nin State workman's compensation hundreds of millions of dollars, over \nbillions of dollars have been realized as a direct result of this kind \nof cooperation. We are all for that. As we pointed out, this is a \nproblem that does not exist.\n  Here is a map showing the virtual nonexistence of these cases before \nthe NLRB. No one in the State of Virginia has brought a successful case \nunder this section in the last 4 years. And if the Senator is here \ntonight to say that there is great confusion or a great problem or \ntrouble among the employers, I would like to know about it because no \none has brought a case to the NLRB under this particular section.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I would say in the course of the hearing \nin the Small Business Committee, we had employers come up who went \nahead and violated the law knowingly and take the risk of being sued, \nand one of them was a Virginia firm.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. The only point is that this is 1992 through 1995 and we \ndo not have those cases recorded. I have gone over in careful detail \nthe total number of cases over the period of the last 10 years that \nhave been brought. I will bring those charts back. I know the Senator \nwants to address the Senate.\n  We are for cooperation. You have the examples of 30,000 different \nemployers where that is taking place now. We have, I believe it is 227 \ncases that have been brought in 4 or 5 years as compared to the 13,000 \nillegal firings of workers in Virginia and around the Nation and the \nremedies that have been out there to provide back pay and \nreinstatement. This is numbers going in the thousands.\n  It seems to me, if we are going to talk about doing something to \nimprove the climate, we ought to be trying to look out for workers' \nrights. In 1994, there were 227 charges of 8(a)(2) violations of all \nkinds--not just those that are the subject of S. 295. In 1994--as you \nknow, Electromation was 2 years before, in 1992--there were 87 cases. \nYou look at those where they have remedies for reinstatements by \nemployers, 7,900; remedies for back pay because of illegal activity, \n8,500, that is a problem.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I disagree with my colleague. I find this \nlaw is always a chilling effect, a very severe chilling effect, on the \nability of the workers of today to implement their suggestions with \nmanagement.\n  If I might pose a second question to my good friend and colleague, \nthis law was put on the books in 1935. And how well we recall the \nprofile of the work force in those days, having less benefit of \neducation, having grown up, father and son, in an atmosphere where the \nworkers were told what to do by the managers who were not looking for \nany suggestions.\n  That labor force, I say to my good friend, has changed dramatically \nsince 1935. Today, it is a well-educated work force. It is a work force \nthat wants to participate and have a voice in their organization, firm, \nmanufacturing company, or whatever the case may be, becoming more \ncompetitive; competitive domestically, competitive internationally. The \nconcept in this legislation is spreading through Asia. My good friend \nis aware of that.\n  I would be interested in his views in comparing the work force of \n1935 to the work force of 1995, 1996, 1997; and whether or not that \nalone, that profile, that change in the individual, does not dictate \nthat the Congress should awaken to change this archaic law?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I would answer it this way, Mr. President. The greatest \ndanger to the workers in 1935 was company-dominated unions--company-\ndominated unions. Anyone who understands the industrial history of this \ncountry understands that they were the principal vehicles which were \nused to deny workers their legitimate rights.\n  All I am saying here is let us not repeat that unfortunate history. \nThis has nothing to do with the education or the ability of the \nemployees. It is: Let us not repeat history, to go back to company-\ndominated unions. And that is the danger of this proposal.\n  The final point I make is this. I know the Senator is familiar with \nthe majority report of the committee. This is the majority report. This \nis the majority report that supports the TEAM Act. Citing the \nCommission on the Future of Worker-Management Relations, their survey \nfound 75 percent of responding employers, large and small, had \nincorporated means of employee involvement in their operation. Among \nthe larger employers, those with 5,000 employees or more, the \npercentage was even higher--96 percent. ``It is estimated that as many \nas 30,000 employers currently employ some form of employee involvement \nor participation.''\n  Wonderful. Amen. You have it going already and you have no complaints\n\n[[Page S7488]]\n\nabout it. Meanwhile, you still have the growing numbers of workers \nbeing thrown out and being reinstated because of violations of the law, \nbecause of illegal activity from many employers, and also remedies for \nback pay.\n  The point I am making is we have those, even in the majority report, \ntaking place. We are all for it. The area that is proscribed is exactly \nthe area which the Senator has referred to, and that is the ability of \ncompany employers making decisions about which employees are going to \nnegotiate and represent employees to negotiate with the employer about \nwage and working conditions. That is proscribed. That is what we are \nconcerned about.\n  I know Senator Kassebaum has spoken eloquently, and it is not her \ndesire to substitute the company-designated employees for that purpose. \nBut I daresay we are going right down the road on it. If we are able to \nmake progress in the other areas, I think we ought to continue to make \nprogress, rather than come up with a solution for a problem that I do \nnot think really exists. But I thank my colleague.\n  Mr. WARNER. I thank the distinguished Senator from Massachusetts. I \nfeel the workers today are far too intelligent, far too mobile, to \nallow that. They will move on to another situation unless they feel \ntheir intelligence is being utilized just as fully as their brawn and \nother attributes.\n  I feel the TEAM Act is a common sense measure designed to eliminate a \nGovernment-imposed restraint on America's competitiveness. This \ncountry, our companies, and our workers must increasingly compete in a \nworld economy. Every shortcoming of a company, whether it is bloated \nmanagement, undereducated employees, or excessive debt, can doom that \ncompany today. This reality faces high-tech firms with Asian \ncompetition and traditional industries struggling against the \ndeveloping nations. It is a one-world economy, and I commend the \nmanagers of this bill for bringing forth this legislation to free the \nbonds and loosen the shackles and restraints on the American worker \ntoday to get out and compete with workers all over the world. How \ndifferent that was in 1935 when, incidentally, this country regrettably \nwas in a period of isolation and our markets were within our own States \nor across State borders.\n\n  Then the Wagner Act. That act presently throws into doubt all kinds \nof employee involvement programs. It was enacted in 1935 when employees \nwere expected to do exactly what they were told. ``You are here to be \ntold what to do, not listened to; to be seen, not to be heard from.''\n  ``Theirs not to reason why, Theirs but to do or die'' to quote \nAlfred, Lord Tennyson. That was over 60 years ago, when almost every \nbusiness required a lot more physical labor than creative thinking. \nThat was when the struggles between labor and management were seen as \nzero-sum battles, where laborers fought for every last crumb that their \nindustrial bosses may have given them. Those days are behind us, \nfortunately.\n  Now we are in 1996 and everybody knows that business must have the \nmost effective, productive, and satisfied employees to compete in the \nworld economy. Which plant is going to be more successful, the one \nwhere management calls all the shots and simply barks orders at the \nemployees? No. It is the company where employees' ideas and suggestions \nare encouraged, listened to, respected, and utilized. It does not take \nan expert on business productivity to know that employee involvement is \nthe key to our survival in this one world market.\n  I was fortunate to chair a hearing in the Committee on Small Business \non the TEAM Act. The hearing was held in April of this year. We heard \ntestimony from experts but we also heard testimony from the laborers \nthemselves. I remember one man proudly wore his blue collar outfit.\n  One expert witness, Edward Potter, of the Employment Policy \nFoundation, testified about detailed studies concerning increases in \nproductivity made by American companies over the past few decades. \nThree-quarters of these increases--I will repeat that--three-quarters \nof the increases in the productivity were attributable to employee \ninvolvement in their respective workplaces. The team concept was far \nmore responsible for productivity improvements than, indeed, education, \ncapital investment, or work experience. Without employee involvement we \nhave little improvement in productivity. And without increases in \nproductivity, we are doomed in this one-world market.\n  I believe in the smarts and talents of the American worker. Companies \nand employees in my Commonwealth of Virginia have shown remarkable \ningenuity in using team concepts to take on world competition. The AMP \nCorp., a worldwide corporation which manufactures electrical \nconnectors, has a plant in Roanoke, VA, which provides several examples \nof this creativity necessary to meet the challenge of foreign \ncompetition.\n  One team of workers went with their managers to another AMP facility \nand learned a new stamping process. Implementing this process in \nRoanoke increased output so much that 20 new jobs were created.\n  Another team of workers was assigned the task of comparing AMP's \nproduction processes to foreign competitors, a job previously done \nsolely by management. The employee team was better able to see how \ninventory levels, technology changes, and production cycles affected \nproductivity. As a result, quality and delivery is better, prices are \nlower, and the employees have increased job security.\n  Last, the community education team reaches out to local schools. \nThrough this team, AMP has been able to recruit new workers from the \nRoanoke area with the necessary technology training rather than \nrecruiting out of the area.\n  Many Virginia companies have had similar success stories. The team \nconcept is one that works and it is astonishing that outdated laws cast \ndoubt on the legality of programs that benefit both the company and its \nemployees.\n  I would like to address for a minute the amendments which will be \noffered by the other side of the aisle. These amendments would require \nthat all teams be formed only after formal elections by the employees \naffected by the decisions of the team. This is micromanagement of the \nworkplace at its worst: the present situation where the legality of \nteams is unclear is a better one than what these amendments would \ncreate.\n  Imagine the logistical nightmares of having to hold a formal election \nevery time more than one employee wants to discuss something with a \nsupervisor. Take a 20-person printing company where Fred and Jane are \ntwo of 18 non-management workers. Their work stations are next to a \npiece of equipment emitting fumes where ventilation around that area is \npoor. As a result, Fred and Jane would like to have the machine moved \nto an empty area with an air duct. Under these amendments, the 18 \nworkers would have to hold a formal election before Fred and Jane could \nsuggest to the owner that the equipment be moved. This election no \ndoubt would have to comply with NLRB regulations about the notice of \nthe election, timing, secrecy provisions, and the like. Is this really \nnecessary? Can't we trust the 18 workers to be watchdogs of their own \nneeds? Can't we trust Fred and Jane to make reasonable suggestions to \nthe owner? Or do we have to micromanage every decision made in the \nworkplace? I think the answer is clear.\n  I believe enactment of the TEAM Act without harmful amendments would \nbe a boon to American industry and American workers. Only by allowing \nthem to compete freely in the world economy can we expect our companies \nto be successful and their employees well-paid and satisfied. I urge my \ncolleagues to join me in sending the TEAM Act to the President.\n  I thank the distinguished chairman of the committee, the Senator from \nKansas, the manager of this legislation, for allowing me to participate \nin this debate. I once again extend my strongest congratulations for \nyour leadership in seeing this legislation move forward and, indeed, to \nour fellow colleague, the Senator from Missouri, Senator Bond, the \nchairman of the Small Business Committee.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM. I thank the Senator from Virginia who knows well the \nimportance of this legislation to the effectiveness and the well-being \nof employees.\n  As a member of the small business community, I think he has addressed\n\n[[Page S7489]]\n\nvery effectively just how much it would be an asset to employees, as \nwell as employers, to have some certainty about their ability to \ncommunicate and work together in the workplace.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I thank my distinguished colleague.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/07/09/senate-section/article/S7469-1", "month": "07", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "09", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7489]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM.

Mr. President, today, I had the pleasure of \nparticipating in the launch of Cable's High-Speed Education Connection, \nthe cable industry's latest contribution to the American educational \nsystem and America's children. At the heart of this initiative is a \ncommitment by the cable industry to offer every elementary and \nsecondary school in the country that is passed by cable, basic high-\nspeed Internet access via cable modems--free of charge.\n  For years, the computer industry has offered greatly discounted \npricing on hardware and software to schools, universities, teachers, \nand students. This same industry is arguably both the most successful \nand the least regulated in the United States.\n  As chairman of the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and \nTransportation, one of my primary goals in authoring the \nTelecommunications Act of 1996 was to apply this competitive formula to \nthe telecommunications industry. I am convinced it is a formula for \nsuccess. This formula creates a world in which different \ntelecommunications companies can compete with each other in the \ndelivery of new services to American consumers.\n  I was especially interested in breaking up the local exchange \nmonopolies and encouraging new entrants to provide alternative \ntelephone services and television programming. I congratulate the cable \nindustry for rapidly taking the lead in demonstrating how this newly \ncompetitive environment accelerates the provision to students and \nteachers of access to the latest and best educational technologies.\n  What will be the result? Elementary and secondary schools will be \nwired for cable. They also will be equipped with modems maximizing the \ndelivery of high-speed digital services. These developments very \npositively impact the future of learning--including the development of \ndistance learning--which particularly helps rural States like South \nDakota. In fact, I understand that among the first cable markets \ntargeted for these new services will be Rapid City, SD. These wired \nschools will expose young generations to some of the best of cable \ntechnology. They will create sophisticated users of the next generation \nof cable information services. They will help create masters of the \ninformation age.\n  So, what we witness here is not the result of Government's decision \nas to which technology should be mandated for low cost delivery to \nschools. We witness instead the initial stages of a competition for the \nloyalty and attention of future adult generations in their decisions \nabout which services best accommodate their needs.\n  Mr. President, I am pleased that the cable industry is taking the \ninitiative today to provide American schools--free of charge--with \nhigh-speed access to the Internet using cable modems. Cable's High-\nSpeed Education Connection builds on the foundation established by \nCable in the Classroom, an ongoing multimillion dollar educational \nproject that provides more than 74,000 schools nationwide with free \naccess to cable systems and more than 6,000 hours of commercial-free \neducational programming each year. The cable industry is to be \ncommended for being a leader in providing educational benefits and \nnetwork access to the communities it serves.\n  I encourage other companies and industries to follow the example the \ncable industry announced today and applaud what likely is only the \nfirst step by the cable industry to improve the quality and \navailability of education technology.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/07/09/senate-section/article/S7489-3", "month": "07", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "09", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7489]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Thomas, one of his secretaries.\n\n\n                      executive messages referred\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the Committee on Armed Services.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/07/09/senate-section/article/S7489-4", "month": "07", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "09", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7489]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n REPORT OF THE OFFICE OF OCEAN AND COASTAL RESOURCE MANAGEMENT, OCEAN \n  SERVICE, NATIONAL OCEANIC AND ATMOSPHERIC ADMINISTRATION FOR FISCAL \n        YEARS 1994 AND 1995--MESSAGE FROM THE PRESIDENT--PM 157\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER laid before the Senate the following message \nfrom the President of the United States, together with an accompanying \nreport; which was referred to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and \nTransportation.\n\nTo the Congress of the United States:\n  I am pleased to submit the Biennial Report of the Office of Ocean and \nCoastal Resource Management, National Ocean Service, National Oceanic \nand Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) for fiscal years 1994 and 1995. \nThis report is submitted as required by section 316 of the Coastal Zone \nManagement Act (CZMA) of 1972, as amended, (16 U.S.C. 1451, et seq.).\n  The report discusses progress made at the national level in \nadministering the Coastal Zone Management and Estuarine Research \nReserve Programs during these years, and spotlights the accomplishments \nof NOAA's State coastal management and estuarine research reserve \nprogram partners under the CZMA.\n                                                  William J.

A concurrent resolution adopted by the Legislature \n     of the State of Louisiana; to the Committee on \n     Appropriations.\n\n                  ``House Concurrent Resolution No. 31\n\n       ``Whereas, approximately six hundred ninety-seven thousand \n     United States service members were deployed to the Persian \n     Gulf in the 1990-1991 Operations Desert Storm/Desert Shield \n     conflict; and\n       ``Whereas, while the vast majority of these troops returned \n     home healthy, a significant number of individuals who served \n     in this conflict have reported persistent symptoms that they \n     believe are related to their experience in the war, \n     collectively known as Persian Gulf War syndrome; and\n       ``Whereas, most common among these symptoms are fatigue, \n     joint pain, headache, sleep disturbances, loss of memory, and \n     rash; and\n       ``Whereas, much more serious conditions have also been \n     linked to Gulf War service, such as upper respiratory \n     disease, birth defects in infants born to Gulf War veterans, \n     mild cases of acute diarrhea, and cutaneous and viscerotropic \n     leishmaniasis, causing death in some cases; and\n       ``Whereas, recently, Dr. Howard B. Urnovitz, a research \n     microbiologist from California, testified before the United \n     States House of Representatives Subcommittee on Human \n     Resources and Intergovernmental Relations that there is an \n     underlying problem with the immune response of Persian Gulf \n     War military to the polio vaccine, which suggests that some \n     factor perturbing the antibody response may be inducing this \n     unexpected outcome; and\n       ``Whereas, there is evidence that the exposure of veterans \n     to chemical agents may explain many of the previously \n     inexplicable symptoms that they are plagued with today, for, \n     according to James J. Tuite, III, former director of the U.S. \n     Senate Banking Committee investigating into the arming of \n     Iraq and the health effects of the Persian Gulf War, the \n     Persian Gulf War was the most toxic battlefield in the \n     history of modern warfare, and studies since World War I have \n     shown that individuals exposed to chemical agents and other \n     related poisons have had symptoms similar to those that \n     plague the Gulf War veterans; and\n       ``Whereas, Mr. Tuite further testified that many of the \n     chemical poisons that were detected and confirmed by \n     coalition chemical specialists are known to affect the \n     central nervous and immune systems; and\n       ``Whereas, to provide protection against the lethal effects \n     of chemical warfare nerve agents, troops deployed to the \n     Persian Gulf were issued twenty-one thirty milligram tablets \n     of pyridostigmine bromide (PB), a drug which has been \n     suggested as a cause of this chronic illness in Gulf \n     Veterans; and\n       ``Whereas, a most recent study by Duke University shows \n     that a combination of three chemicals, including PB, used to \n     protect soldiers from insect-borne diseases and nerve-gas \n     poisoning may have caused the symptoms reported by an \n     estimated thirty thousand Gulf War veterans based on a study \n     using chickens, who suffered neurological dysfunction when \n     issued the mixture of the insecticides and the anti-nerve-gas \n     agent; and\n       ``Whereas, the United States Government has responded to \n     the concerns of the failing health of these veterans by \n     creating several projects to help to treat the afflicted \n     veterans and to research the causes of their disease; and\n       ``Whereas, the Department of Defense, headed by Secretary \n     William Perry and Deputy Secretary John White, and in support \n     of President Clinton's commitment to our Persian Gulf troops, \n     has launched an unprecedented effort in researching and \n     treating Gulf War veterans' illnesses; and\n       ``Whereas, such projects include the Comprehensive Clinical \n     Evaluation Program (CCEP), which was initiated in June, 1994, \n     by the Department of Defense to provide in-depth medical \n     examinations to nearly twenty thousand service and family \n     members who are suffering from conditions induced by the Gulf \n     War; and\n       ``Whereas, a Specialized Care Center (SCC) was opened at \n     Walter Reed Army Medical Center in March, 1995, for the \n     intensive treatment of symptomatic Persian Gulf War veterans, \n     and another of these centers is scheduled to open at Wilford \n     Hall Medical Center in San Antonio, Texas, in mid-May, 1996; \n     and\n       ``Whereas, ongoing and planned epidemiologic studies by the \n     Department of Defense, Veterans' Affairs, and Health and \n     Human Services further search for answers to these \n     inexplicable symptoms of disease suffered by Gulf War \n     veterans; and\n       ``Whereas, the Clinton administration has also created an \n     advisory committee on Gulf War veterans' illnesses to ensure \n     an independent, open, and comprehensive examination of health \n     concerns related to Gulf War \n\n[[Page S7491]]\n\n     service, which consists of twelve members made up of \n     veterans, scientists, health care professionals, and \n     policy experts; and\n       ``Whereas, the committee delivered in interim report in \n     February, 1996, which offered directives to the Department of \n     Defense regarding medical and clinical issues, research, and \n     the hazards of future use of chemical and biological weapons, \n     and will deliver their final report to the president no later \n     than December, 1996; and\n       ``Whereas, as many questions remain unanswered regarding \n     Gulf War Syndrome, it is vital that our government continue \n     to conduct the research and treatment that it has initiated \n     and further increase its allocations for such research and \n     treatment in order to provide relief for the many veterans \n     afflicted by Gulf War Syndrome; and\n       ``Whereas, these troops bravely fought for our country in \n     the Gulf War, putting their lives on the line in the name of \n     the United States of America; and\n       ``Whereas, the courageous service demonstrated by all \n     troops deployed in the Gulf War conflict merits the United \n     States Government's continued efforts in solving this medical \n     dilemma; and\n       ``Whereas, it is vital to the health of our nation that the \n     efforts to answer the questions involved with Gulf War \n     Syndrome be continued by our government: Therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Legislature of Louisiana does hereby \n     memorialize congress to continue its efforts to fund and \n     provide for the treatment of Persian Gulf War Syndrome and \n     for continued research about the causes, effects, and \n     treatment of the syndrome, and does further request that \n     congress allocate additional resources to provide sufficient \n     funding to make such research and treatment a priority so \n     that this disease can be better understood and ultimately \n     cured; and be it further\n       Resolved, That a suitable copy of this Resolution be \n     transmitted to the secretary of the United States Senate, the \n     clerk of the United States House of Representatives, and to \n     each member of the congressional delegation from Louisiana.\n                                                                    ____\n\n       POM-647. A resolution adopted by the Legislature of the \n     State of Alaska; to the Committee on Banking, Housing,and \n     Urban Affairs.\n\n                      ``Senate Joint Resolution 37\n\n       ``Whereas Alaska had, by regulation, imposed a primary \n     manufacturing requirement applicable to timber harvested from \n     state-owned land that is destined for export from the state; \n     and\n       ``Whereas that regulation was permissive, allowing the \n     director of the division of land to require that primary \n     manufacture of forest products be accomplished within the \n     state; and\n       ``Whereas, considering the Commerce Clause of the United \n     States Constitution, in Southcentral Timber Development, Inc. \n     v. Wunnicke, 467 U.S. 82, 91 L.Ed.2d 71, 104 S.Ct. 2237 \n     (1984), the United States Supreme Court determined that the \n     state's regulation could not be given effect; while the court \n     found evidence of a clearly defined federal policy imposing \n     primary manufacture requirements as to timber taken from \n     federal land in Alaska, it determined that the existing \n     Congressional sanction reached only to activities on federal \n     land and concluded that the state's assertion of \n     Congressional authorization by silence to allow a state to \n     regulate similar activities on nonfederal land could not be \n     inferred; and\n       ``Whereas since the Wunnicke decision, Congress has, in the \n     Forest Resources Conservation and Shortage Relief Act of \n     1990, extended an existing ban on unprocessed log exports \n     from federal land in the 11 contiguous Western states to \n     cover timber harvested from nonfederal sources in those \n     states; the extension of the ban on unprocessed log exports \n     in those states collectively does not affect Alaska; and\n       ``Whereas the principal purposes, stated or assumed, in the \n     1990 Congressional Act for extending the ban on unprocessed \n     log exports in the contiguous Western states--the efficient \n     use and effective conservation of forests and forest \n     resources, the avoidance of a shortfall in unprocessed timber \n     in the marketplace, and concern for development of a rational \n     log export policy as a national matter--are equally valid \n     with respect to the significant timber resources held by this \n     state, its political subdivisions, and its public university; \n     and\n       ``Whereas the state cannot act to regulate, restrict, or \n     prohibit the export of unprocessed logs harvested from land \n     of the state, its political subdivisions, and the University \n     of Alaska without a legislative expression demonstrating \n     Congressional intent that is unmistakably clear; Be it\n       Resolved, That the legislature of the State of Alaska urges \n     the United States Congress to give an affirmative expression \n     of approval to a policy authorizing the state to regulate, \n     restrict, or prohibit the export of unprocessed logs \n     harvested from its land and from the land of its political \n     subdivisions and the University of Alaska.\n                                                                    ____\n\n       POM-648.

A bill to provide for improved information \n     collection and dissemination by the Environmental Protection \n     Agency, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \n     Environment and Public Works.\n\n\n         THE PUBLIC TRUST AND ENVIRONMENTAL ACCOUNTABILITY ACT\n\n  Mr. BRADLEY. Mr. President, today I am introducing the Public Trust \nand Environmental Accountability Act to improve collection, retrieval, \nand dissemination of vital environmental data needed for community \ninformation and disaster response.\n  For the first time, under the Public Trust and Environmental \nAccountability Act, firefighters, plant neighbors, local governments, \nand the general public will have easy access to complete data on a \nplant's permit compliance and plant operation. Not only will the public \nbe able to discover whether their local facility has had past \nenvironmental violations but they will also be able to research that \ncompany's compliance history throughout the United States using just \none consolidated file, available by computer search.\n  For example, last year, when the Napp Technologies plant in Lodi, NJ, \nexploded, the community surrounding the plant had little knowledge of \nwhat went on within the plant gates. If the Public Trust and \nEnvironmental Accountability Act had been in effect, local citizens \nwould have known: what chemicals were stored onsite; what permits were \nheld by the plant; what violations had occurred; whether there had been \nany accidents or releases of chemicals; and, when the plant was last \ninspected.\n  Currently, data collected by the Environmental Protection Agency \n[EPA] is scattered and fragmented across the Agency or left in files at \nthe State level. Instead of centralizing and coordinating all data by \nplant or location, much of EPA's information is kept in numerous \nduplicative files in the Agency's separate program offices where it is \ndivided arbitrarily by the type of pollutant under regulation such as \nair, water, or solid waste. Thus using EPA data to build a complete \ncompliance profile of a particular plant is both time consuming and \nunnecessarily difficult.\n  However, my bill streamlines this unwieldy system by directing EPA to \nenhance access, encourage public use, and improve management of public \ninformation that it has collected under the Agency's many environmental \nstatutes, pollution prevention initiatives and environmental permitting \nrequirements. Under the act, EPA would create standard formats for \ninformation\n\n[[Page S7493]]\n\ncollection and improve the coordination of data which it has received \nfrom its various units and from other sources such as State agencies. \nThe Act would also provide the public with greater computer access to \nEPA data bases.\n  No additional data would be required from the private sector. In \nfact, the current reporting burden on industry could be reduced once \nstreamlined data collection was in place. The bill also complements new \nEPA initiatives aimed at consolidating permit requirements and \neliminating paperwork.\n  This bill is an example of how we can use public power to help \ncommunities protect themselves through access to information rather \nthan through additional programs or more bureaucracy.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1935\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n                        SECTION 1.

The prolonged down cycle is \nespecially troubling because it affects the livelihoods of thousands of \nranching families in Idaho and across the country.\n  These beef producers are the largest sector of Idaho and American \nagriculture. Over 1 million families raise over 100 million head of \nbeef cattle every year. This contributes over $36 billion to local \neconomies. Even with the extended cycle of low prices, direct cash \nreceipts from the Idaho cattle industry were almost $620 million in \n1995. These totals only represent direct sales; they do not capture the \nmultiplier effect that cattle ranches have in their local economies \nfrom expenditures on labor, feed, fuel, property taxes, and other \ninputs.\n  Over the years, cattle operations have provided a decent living and \ngood way of life in exchange for long days, hard work, and dedication. \nWhile the investment continues to be high, the returns have been low in \nrecent years.\n  The problems facing the cattle industry in recent years are complex. \nThe nature of the market dictates that stable consumption combined with \nincreased productivity and growing herd size yield lower prices to \nproducers. This, combined with high feed prices and limited export \nopportunities, has caused a near crisis.\n  Many Idahoans have contacted me on this issue. Some suggest the \nFederal Government intervene in the market to help producers. However, \nmany others have expressed fear that Federal intervention, if \nexperience is any indication, will only complicate matters and may also \ncreate a number of unintended results. I tend to agree with the latter. \nTime and again, I have seen lawmakers and bureaucrats in Washington, \nDC, albeit well-intentioned, take a difficult situation and make it \nworse. This does not mean that I believe Government has no role to \nplay. I have supported and will continue to support measures of proven \nvalue. However, I will continue to follow this situation closely with \nthe hope that free market forces will, in the long run, aid in making \ncattle producers more efficient, productive, and profitable.\n  The cattle industry is part of a complex, long-term cycle; however, \nthere are producers who might not survive the short term consequences. \nThe beef industry assistance resolution addresses a number of these \nshort-term issues. These are issues that were raised at a hearing of \nthe Agriculture Committee that I chaired a few weeks ago.\n\n  The resolution has five sections--antitrust monitoring, market \nreporting, private sector self-regulation, recognition of barriers to \ninternational trade, and emergency loan guarantees.\n  Section 1 encourages the Secretary of Agriculture and Department of \nJustice to increase the monitoring of mergers and acquisitions in the \nbeef industry. Investigation of possible barriers in the beef packing \nsector for new firms and with other commodities is encouraged.\n  Section 2 directs the Secretary of Agriculture to expedite the \nreporting of existing beef categories and add additional categories. \nThese categories include contract, formula and live cash cattle prices \nand boxed beef prices. The Secretary is also encouraged to increase the \nfrequency of captive supply cattle from every 14 to 7 days. I am \nespecially interested in the improved reporting of all beef and live \ncattle exports and imports. The second section also directs the \nSecretary to capture data on a previously unrecorded segment of the \nmarket--away from home consumption. While this market consumes \napproximately half of the Nation's beef production, very little is \nknown about it.\n  Section 3 encourages two very important measures within the private \nsector. First, meat packing companies are encouraged to fully utilize a \ngrid pricing structure which will provide producers with a more \ncomplete picture for the particular type of the cattle they produce. \nSecond, agricultural lenders are encouraged to consider the total asset \nportfolio, not just cash-flow, when evaluating this year's beef loans. \nEven the best operators will have great difficulty cash-flowing a \ncattle outfit because of the prolonged period of low prices.\n  Section 4 recognizes a number of barriers to international trade that \nadversely affect American beef producers. The section is meant to \nelevate the importance of all trade issues and specifically references \nthe elimination of the European Union hormone ban and animal health \nbarriers between the United States and Canada.\n  Section 5 recommends that emergency loan guarantees be made available \nto agricultural lenders with cattle industry loans. I am disappointed \nthat the President zeroed out funding for this program in his fiscal \nyear 1997 proposal. I have heard from a number of lenders that a high \nnumber of loans are questionable for this fall.\n  The beef industry assistance resolution is a measure designed to \nprovide immediate, short-term solutions to some of the serious problems \nfacing the cattle industry. I know that a number of my colleagues have \nlegislation pending in regard to the cattle market. I would comment \nthat I see this resolution as a starting point, not an ending point for \ncattle industry issues.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/07/09/senate-section/article/S7493-2", "month": "07", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "09", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7494-S7498]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n             THE SMALL BUSINESS JOB PROTECTION ACT OF 1996\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                  ROTH (AND OTHERS) AMENDMENT NO. 4436\n\n  Mr. ROTH (for himself, Mr. Moynihan, Mr. Lott, and Mr. Daschle) \nproposed an amendment to the bill (H.R. 3448) to provide tax relief for \nsmall businesses, to protect jobs, to create opportunities, to increase \nthe take-home pay of workers, and for other purposes; as follows:\n\n       On page 243, strike lines 9 through 11, and insert:\n       (b) Effective Dates.--\n       (1) In general.--The amendment made by this section shall \n     apply to taxable years beginning after December 31, 1986.\n       (2) Transitional rule.--If--\n       (A) for purposes of applying part III of subchapter F of \n     chapter 1 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to any taxable \n     year beginning before January 1, 1987, an agricultural or \n     horticultural organization did not treat any portion of \n     membership dues received by it as income derived in an \n     unrelated trade or business, and\n       (B) such organization had a reasonable basis for not \n     treating such dues as income derived in an unrelated trade or \n     business,\n\n     then, for purposes of applying such part III to any such \n     taxable year, in no event shall any portion of such dues be \n     treated as derived in an unrelated trade or business.\n       (3) Reasonable basis.--For purposes of paragraph (2), an \n     organization shall be treated as having a reasonable basis \n     for not treating membership dues as income derived in an \n     unrelated trade or business if the taxpayer's treatment of \n     such dues was in reasonable reliance on any of the following:\n       (A) Judicial precedent, published rulings, technical advice \n     with respect to the organization, or a letter ruling to the \n     organization.\n       (B) A past Internal Revenue Service audit of the \n     organization in which there was no assessment attributable to \n     the reclassification of membership dues for purposes of the \n     tax on unrelated business income.\n       (C) Long-standing recognized practice of agricultural or \n     horticultural organizations.\n       On page 246, strike lines 1 through 3, and insert:\n       (b) Effective Dates.--\n       (1) In general.--The amendments made by this section shall \n     apply to remuneration paid--\n       (A) after December 31, 1994, and\n       (B) after December 31, 1984, and before January 1, 1995, \n     unless the payor treated such remuneration (when paid) as \n     being subject to tax under chapter 21 of the Internal Revenue \n     Code of 1986.\n       (2) Reporting requirement.--The amendment made by \n     subsection (a)(1)(C) shall apply to remuneration paid after \n     December 31, 1996.\n       On page 256, line 2, strike the quotation marks.\n       On page 256, between lines 2 and 3, insert the following:\n       ``(5) Preservation of prior period safe harbor.--If--\n\n[[Page S7495]]\n\n       ``(A) an individual would (but for the treatment referred \n     to in subparagraph (B)) be deemed not to be an employee of \n     the taxpayer under subsection (a) for any prior period, and\n       ``(B) such individual is treated by the taxpayer as an \n     employee for employment tax purposes for any subsequent \n     period,\n\n     then, for purposes of applying such taxes for such prior \n     period with respect to the taxpayer, the individual shall be \n     deemed not to be an employee.\n       ``(6) Substantially similar position.--For purposes of this \n     section, the determination as to whether an individual holds \n     a position substantially similar to a position held by \n     another individual shall include consideration of the \n     relationship between the taxpayer and such individuals.''\n       On page 257, between lines 5 and 6, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. 1123.

FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       (1) the escalating demands of global competition have \n     compelled an increasing number of American employers to make \n     dramatic changes in work-place and employer-employee \n     relationships;\n       (2) these changes involve an enhanced role for the employee \n     in workplace decisionmaking, often referred to as ``employee \n     involvement'', which has taken many forms, including self-\n     managed work teams, quality-of-worklife, quality circles, and \n     joint labor-management committees;\n       (3) employee involvement structures, which operate \n     successfully in both unionized and non-unionized settings, \n     have been established by over 80 percent of the largest \n     employers of the United States and exist in an estimated \n     30,000 workplaces;\n       (4) in addition to enhancing the productivity and \n     competitiveness of American businesses, employee involvement \n     structures have had a positive impact on the lives of those \n     employees, better enabling them to reach their potential in \n     their working lives;\n       (5) recognizing that foreign competitors have successfully \n     utilized employee involvement techniques, Congress has \n     consistently joined business, labor, and academic leaders in \n     encouraging and recognizing successful employee involvement \n     structures in the workplace through such incentives as the \n     Malcolm Baldrige National Quality Award;\n       (6) employers who have instituted legitimate employee \n     involvement structures have not done so to interfere with the \n     collective bargaining rights guaranteed by the labor laws, as \n     was the case in the 1930s when employers established \n     deceptive sham ``company unions'' to avoid unionization; and\n       (7) the prohibition of the National Labor Relations Act \n     against employer domination or interference with the \n     formation or administration of a labor organization has \n     produced uncertainty and apprehension among employers \n     regarding the continued development of employee involvement \n     structures.\n       (b) Purposes.--It is the purpose of this Act to--\n       (1) protect legitimate employee involvement structures \n     against governmental interference;\n       (2) preserve existing protections against deceptive, \n     coercive employer practices; and\n       (3) permit legitimate employee involvement structures where \n     workers may discuss issues involving terms and conditions of \n     employment, to continue to evolve and proliferate.\n\n     SEC. 3.

MORGERA AND HIS SERVICE TO THE AIR FORCE\n\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to A1c. Peter \nJ. Morgera of Stratham, NH. Last Tuesday, this courageous young man \nfell victim to a tragic act of terrorism at the United States military \ncomplex in Dhahran, Saudi Arabia. Peter leaves behind his parents, \nRichard and Diane, and his two brothers, Tommy and Michael. He honored \nhis country by serving overseas in Saudi Arabia and his family and \ncommunity will miss him greatly.\n  Peter, a 25-year-old flight mechanic, was one of 19 American \nservicemen who lost their lives just 2 weeks ago when a truck bomb \ndetonated outside military housing in Dhahran, Saudi Arabia. This blast \nwhich, in addition to taking the lives of Peter and 19 others, wounded \n270 and was the worst incident of terrorism since the attack in Beirut \nin 1983. Peter, who was scheduled to return home on June 30, had served \nhis country for 3 years in the Air Force.\n  Peter was a 1990 graduate of Exeter Area High School and is described \nby those who knew him as a great person, a hard worker, and someone who \nwas always ready to lend a hand. When remembering Peter, his family and \nfriends invariably mention his strong sense of community spirit and \ncompassionate nature. He always did everything he could to help people \nwhen they needed it. At age 16, Peter began working with the Stratham \nVolunteer Fire Department and his fellow firefighters described him as \nextremely reliable and an excellent co-worker. One of the many ways he \nserved the community was through teaching fire prevention at area \nschools. Peter had the kind of love for family and community this \ncountry is built upon, and it is individuals such as him that make this \ncountry great.\n  Peter's memory will be one of leadership and charity. He chose not to \nignore the needs of those around him but to help meet those needs. \nWhether\n\n[[Page S7500]]\n\nsomeone needed a helping hand or just a friendly face, Peter was there. \nJust last week, he was honored, along with his fellow servicemen who \nalso died in the blast, at a special funeral ceremony by President \nClinton. He served not only his community but his country as well, and \nhis country will never forget his service or his sacrifice. We should, \nhowever, look beyond the tragedy of this great loss and let Peter's \nsacrifice be an example for us all. Although he left this world \nprematurely, he touched many lives with his caring ways and his memory \nwill endure in many hearts.\n  Although Peter's death weighs heavily in the hearts of his family and \nfriends, we should not dwell in sadness, but remember his zeal for life \nand continue to uphold those principles which he held dear. Peter's \ndedication to community was the embodiment of the American ideal, \npeople like him are the backbone of their communities and the Nation. \nHe gave his life as a guardian of the community and the Nation he loved \nso well.

Mr. President, today by unanimous consent the \nHouse approved H.R. 3121, a bill that will make a real contribution to \nincreasing transparency and improving congressional oversight over arms \ntransfers. In taking this action, the House accepted the Senate-passed \namendments, obviating the need for a conference and clearing the bill \nfor signature by the President. Since no report was filed with the bill \nin the Senate, I would like to take this opportunity to explain some of \nthe changes that were made in the Foreign Relations Committee, and the \nrationale behind them.\n  First, we deleted a section that would have raised the thresholds \nabove which arms sales must be notified to Congress. The current \nlevels--$14 million for major defense equipment, $50 million for any \ndefense articles or services, and $200 million for design and \nconstruction services--cannot be raised without reducing effective \noversight, particularly since many of the most serious abuses of human \nrights take place with less sophisticated weapons systems.\n  Second, we lengthened the notification period for grant transfers of \nexcess defense articles to 30 days, which is the current standard under \nsection 516 of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961. H.R. 3121 \nstreamlines the existing excess defense article authorities, giving the \nadministration added flexibility in many areas in exchange for a tight \ncap on the value of weapons that are provided to foreign countries \nwithout cost. Although it would have been preferable that this new cap \nof $350 million be calculated according to original acquisition cost \nrather than current value, the important point is that the cap is a \nfirm one.\n  I remain concerned, however, about procedures for determining the \ncurrent value of excess defense articles. In January 1994, a GAO report \nfound that ``irregularities in pricing/valuing EDA's compromise the \nreliability of EDA data.'' It concluded that ``the military services \ndid not always adhere to guidelines for pricing/valuing EDA's, and as a \nresult, the acquisition and current values of the EDA program were \nunderstated.''\n  According to pricing directives now in effect, equipment may be \nvalued at anywhere between 5 and 50 percent of its original acquisition \ncost, depending on its age and condition. Over the past 4 years the \ncurrent values have averaged about 25 percent of acquisition costs. It \nis the congressional expectation that, in implementing this provision, \nthe Secretary of Defense will instruct the military services to adhere \nconsistently to pricing directives that accurately reflect the value of \nthe article to be transferred. Pricing decisions must be made without \nregard to the recipient of the article or to the amount of equipment \nthat could be transferred within the statutory ceiling.\n  A third change to the initial version of the bill is a renewal of the \nrequirement in current law that excess defense articles be offered to \nGreece and Turkey at the same ratio that applies to foreign military \nfinancing. The purpose of this provision is to promote peace and \nstability in the eastern Mediterranean by maintaining the military \nbalance and restraining arms transfers to the region.\n  Fourth, we have reinstated an annual report that will show all the \ndefense articles and services the United States provided to each \nforeign country in the previous fiscal year. There is growing concern \nabout the proliferation of authorities under which the United States \nprovides military aid, weapons and training to foreign countries. In \naddition to traditional sources such as grant military aid, \ninternational military education and training, leases and loans, and \ncommercial sales, there have now been added such authorities as excess \ndefense article transfers, drawdowns, cascading under the CFE Treaty, \nthe defense export loan guarantee facility, and the military-to-\nmilitary contacts program. Obviously it is important that, in making \nforeign policy decisions, we have a complete picture of all the ways in \nwhich we are providing arms or military assistance to other countries.\n  Fifth, a provision was added repealing the sunset clause on the \nNuclear Proliferation Prevention Act. The NPPA, which refines and \nexpands sanctions against countries and companies that help non-nuclear \nweapon states to acquire nuclear weapons, would otherwise expire with \nthe enactment of the next State Department authorization bill.\n  Finally, two new sections increase transparency in reporting of arms \nsales. Section 155 requires that certifications of government-to-\ngovernment arms sales, which are submitted under section 36(b) of the \nArms Export Control Act, and notifications of commercial arms sales, \nsubmitted under section 36(c), are printed in the Federal Register. \nSection 156 ensures that at least the name of the country and the type \nand quantity of equipment for which commercial export licenses are \nissued be publicly disclosed, unless the President determines this \nwould be contrary to the national interest. This reverses the burden of \nproof that applies under current law, where commercial licenses are \nrevealed only if the Secretary of State determines it to be in the \nnational interest to do so. Both of these provisions are of particular \ninterest to the arms control and human rights communities, who have \nexperienced unnecessary difficulty in obtaining information about \nunclassified arms sales.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/07/09/senate-section/article/S7500-1", "month": "07", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "09", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7500]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     ADDITIONAL COSPONSOR--S. 1898\n\n Mr. DOMENICI.

I further request that in the future \nthis bill be known as the Domenici-Simon bill, as it was intended to be \nwhen it was introduced on June 24.\n  Thank you for the opportunity to clarify this issue.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/07/09/senate-section/article/S7500-2", "month": "07", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "09", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7500-S7501]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       JOB PROTECTION ACT OF 1996\n\n Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I am pleased the Senate passed the \nSmall Business Job Protection Act of 1996. However, I am disappointed \nthe Senate rejected the Kennedy amendment to the minimum wage increase.\n  I cannot sit idly by as I hear of those struggling to live on today's \nminimum wage. I thought, as many of you do, that the typical minimum \nwage earner was someone like my daughter or one of her friends: a \nteenager flipping burgers or taking food orders to earn some extra cash \nfor new clothes or a movie.\n  That, however, is a grave misperception. The sad fact is that 73 \npercent of those earning between $4.25 and $5.14 an hour are over the \nage of 20. That means that 9 million adults this year will have to try \nto live on a salary of $8,840. One-third of these same\n\n[[Page S7501]]\n\nadults are the sole sources of income for their families. If these \nworkers were attempting to support a family of three, they would fall \n$2,682 below the Federal poverty line.\n  I am extremely concerned that 58 percent of those struggling with a \nminimum wage are women--5.2 million women, many of these single \nmothers, would benefit directly from this increase.\n  These single moms are trying. They are trying to raise two kids on a \nbelow-poverty income. And how does Congress reward a struggling \nparent's hard work? By attacking Medicaid that would have paid for her \nson's asthma medicine. By cutting the child care support that enables \nher to work. By taking away funding for nutrition programs that pay for \nher kids to eat at school or day care. By eliminating her Head Start \nProgram that gives her kids a chance at coming to school ready and able \nto learn. By refusing to add 90 cents to her hourly wage--a wage that \npays for heat, clothing and food.\n  Aren't these exactly the same individuals and families we are trying \nto keep employed and off of Federal support? Instead, this Congress has \ntargeted the low-income family with cut after cut and a resistance to \nmove them above the poverty line.\n  Mr. President, the Kennedy amendment would not have eliminated jobs. \nIt would have barely kept people working--people who otherwise would be \ncompletely reliant on public support. If we had only passed this \namendment a year ago, it would have meant that the single mother would \nhave earned an additional $2,000 today.\n  To low-income families, that would have meant more than 7 months of \ngroceries, 4 months of rent, a full year of health care costs, or 9 \nmonths of utility bills.\n  I did not reach my decision to support the minimum wage hastily. I \nhave listened carefully to the concerns of small business owners from \nacross my State, who have highlighted the implications of this \nincrease. I don't want to see prices for the American consumer rise or \njobs eliminated. But I don't think an increase to the minimum wage will \nend employment in small business, either.\n  It has now been more than 5 years since the last minimum wage \nincrease. We must remember that the value of the current minimum wage \nhas fallen by nearly 50 cents since 1991 and is now 27 percent lower \nthan it was in 1979. Now is the time to adjust that inequality and \ndemonstrate a true commitment to our working families.\n  A slight increase in this wage provides those who work hard and play \nby the rules an increased opportunity and a chance to succeed. If any \nof my colleagues opposes the minimum wage, I urge them to live on \n$8,840 this year and then reconsider their vote.\n  Mr. President, I want to take a minute to express my support for \ntitle I of H.R. 3448, the small business provisions. This section \nincorporates a variety of tax changes, pension simplifications and S \ncorporation reforms that expand business opportunities for America's \nsmall businesses.\n  We all know small business is the engine that drives the American \neconomy. As large corporations across the country downsize and \nconsolidate, innovative small businesses expand and add jobs to the \nwork force. In 1995, 22,000 individuals in Washington State were \nemployed by software-related companies--66 percent of these companies \nare small businesses with less than 11 employees.\n  This legislation will only make it easier for these and other small \nbusinesses to invest in research and development, raise capital and \nspur economic growth.\n  Most importantly, the legislation reinstates several expired tax \nprovisions including the research and development [R] tax credit and \nemployer provided educational assistance.\n  The R tax credit is vital to small, technology-based companies that \nneed to invest in long-term endeavors in order to stay competitive in \nrapidly changing business climates. At the same time, the employer-\nprovided educational assistance is essential to maintaining a highly \nskilled, well-educated work force.\n  The legislation also improves the flexibility subchapter S \ncorporations have when they set out to raise capital. Like S. 758, a \nbill which I cosponsored, this legislation raises the number of \nshareholders who can invest in S corporations. It increases the number \nfrom 35 to 75, and in doing so, this bill greatly increase an S \ncorporation's ability to raise capital.\n  Mr. President, title I of this bill also incorporates two changes to \nour pension laws that were introduced in S. 1756, legislation I support \nthat was introduced by Senator Moseley-Braun. First, the Treasury \nDepartment will be required to create a clear spousal consent form so \nthat couples can make informed decisions about annuities. Also, \nTreasury will need to develop a qualified domestic relations order form \nspelling out how, to whom and when pension plans should be paid upon \ndivorce. These provisions are essential to protecting spousal rights.\n  Finally, H.R. 3448 expands tax deductible IRA contributions to \nhomemakers. This change will make retirement savings opportunities \npossible for individuals who work at home rather than in the work \nforce. It will encourage greater savings in the United States, and it \nwill improve retirement security for our hard-working homemakers.\n  Mr. President, even without the Kennedy amendment, this legislation \nstill goes a long way to helping over 10 million hard-working \nAmericans. This legislation ultimately raises the minimum wage 90 cents \nover 2 years. It rewards our working families as they struggle to rise \nabove the poverty line. I am proud the Senate took this important and \neagerly awaited step today. \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/07/09/senate-section/article/S7500-3", "month": "07", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "09", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7501]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        METRO DETROIT YOUTH DAY\n\n Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise to recognize today as Metro \nDetroit Youth Day in my home State of Michigan. I commend the many \nsponsors and organizers of this event, being held today at Belle Isle's \nathletic field in Detroit. Recognizing the importance of leisure and \nrecreation in improving the lives of youth, the sponsors and organizers \nof Metro Detroit Youth Day have dedicated their time and resources to \ngiving young people in Detroit an opportunity to participate in \nrecreational activities in a safe, yet competitive, environment.\n  Metro Detroit Youth Day emphasizes the need for physical education \nand fitness with the need for good sportsmanship. It brings together \ncommunity leaders, business leaders, service organizations, and young \npeople. Over 14,000 youth and 700 volunteers will participate this \nyear.\n  I would like to pay special tribute to the following cochairs of \nDetroit Youth Day. In chairing this event, they have given young people \nexamples to follow and have been role models for many others in the \ncommunity--both young and old. They truly have made this day count. And \nso, I commend Harold Edwards of MichCon; Edward Deeb of Michigan Food \nand Beverage Association; Sharon Williams of Omni-Care; Tom Moss of \nWest Side Athletics; Detroit Police Chief Isiah McKinnon; Ernest \nBurkeen of the Detroit Recreation Department; and Keith Bennett with \nStarr Commonwealth Schools.\n  In 1991, Metro Detroit Youth Day received the 477th Point of Light \nAward. In the spirit of that award, I offer congratulations and thanks \nto all who continue to make Metro Detroit Youth Day a success.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/07/09/senate-section/article/S7501-1", "month": "07", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "09", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7501]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           ORDER OF BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. DeWINE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise this evening to talk about an issue \nthat I have talked about on several occasions previously on the floor, \nand that has to do with a problem we have in this country, a serious \nproblem, and that is a shortage of organ donors.\n  We need to raise the awareness of the American people about this very \nimportant issue. That is why today I am calling upon the Citizens \nPostal Advisory Committee to approve a postage stamp in honor of organ \ndonation.\n  Every day in this country eight people die--eight people every single \nday die--who are on a waiting list, a waiting list to have an organ \ntransplant operation. In 1994, over 3,000 Americans\n\n[[Page S7502]]\n\ndied while waiting for an organ, 142 of them in my home State of Ohio.\n  As of May 1 of this year, which are the most current available \nfigures that I have, there were 46,128 Americans on the waiting list \nfor organs. That was an increase over the April numbers, just 1 month \nbefore.\n  On April 3, there were 45,583 people on the waiting list. So just in \n1 month, over 500 people were added to that waiting list.\n  As of May 1, 32,256 people were waiting for kidneys. That is an \nincrease of 344 people in less than a month.\n  On that same date, 6,273 people were waiting for a liver, and that is \n137 more than in April.\n  On that same date, May 1, there were 1,339 people waiting for a \nkidney-pancreas transplant, 30 more than in April.\n  And on that same date, there were 3,599 people waiting for a new \nheart, 50 more than a month before on April 3.\n  Mr. President, if we ask our expert on this, our colleague from \nTennessee, Dr. Frist, he will tell us these people can be helped. He \nwill tell us these people did not have to die. He will tell us that the \ntechnology is there to save them and that what we are lacking is enough \norgan donations, what we are lacking is enough family members who lose \na loved one who are willing, in a time of great tragedy and great hurt, \nto say, ``Yes; yes, I will agree to have my loved one's organs \ntransplanted into someone else so they can live.''\n  The technology is there to save these lives. It is the organs that \nare missing. That is why all American families need to talk about this \nissue. It is something we as Americans do not want to talk about. We do \nnot want to talk about death. We do not want to talk about funerals. We \ndo not want to think a tragedy may strike. But it is important that we \ntalk about this before something happens.\n  I am convinced, and, in fact, the statistics, polls and studies show \nit, the vast majority of Americans, if they thought they could help \nsomeone, would want their organs donated to save someone's life. The \nproblem is that as a people, we do not talk about it; as families, we \ndo not talk about it. So the next of kin, the families, the fathers, \nthe mothers, the brothers, the sisters who have to make this decision \ndo not really know what to do because that issue has never been \ndiscussed. That is why the national campaign is to get families to talk \nabout it, because we believe if families do talk about this, they will \nultimately make the right decision and lives will be saved.\n  We need to do everything we can to make sure that this issue does get \nthe attention of all Americans. We need literally to start a \nconversation about this at the kitchen table of every single family in \nthis country. We need to find creative ways to do this, creative ways \nto get people's attention.\n  There is one particular measure that I would like to talk about today \nthat I think will get people's attention. Tomorrow, the citizens stamp \nadvisory committee will meet to review and make recommendations for new \npostage stamps. Nearly 300,000 Americans have already signed a petition \nurging this stamp advisory committee to approve a postage stamp \nhonoring organ and tissue donation. I believe that if we put our \nmessage on the envelopes of millions of Americans, we will strike an \nimportant blow for public awareness of the need for organs.\n  Here is one example of what the stamp could look like. I am not an \nartist. I did not draw this. Anybody who knows me knows I did not do \nthis. But there are some creative people in our office who had some \nideas, and they put this together. We bring it to the floor only to \nshow what a stamp like this could look like, and the message is pretty \nbasic: ``Organ Donation. Share Your Life . . . Share Your Decision.'' \nThat is the national campaign for people to talk about it before \ntragedy does strike.\n  The green ribbon in this stamp symbolizes life. The stamp would send \nthe message that organ donation is a gift of life. This is literally \ntrue. The donor shortage in this country is one of the most important \nproblems in health care today and a problem that is not easily solved. \nI believe the stamp advisory committee should approve this organ \ndonation stamp in the same spirit in which it approved this year's \nbreast cancer awareness stamp.\n  By approving this stamp, the advisory committee will literally be \nsaving lives. It will prompt exactly the kind of family discussions we \nhave been trying to promote. This postage stamp would save lives and \nwould save lives without major cost or major effort.\n  The advisory committee should heed the appeals of over 300,000 \nconcerned Americans, including some Members of Congress, to go ahead \nand approve this stamp. By doing so, the postal advisory committee \nwould send a strong message to all Americans about the lifesaving \ndecision every single family can make.\n  I thank the Chair, yield the floor and suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Objection was heard on that on behalf of, I believe, the \nSenator from Montana, who had a judge that was not on the list, that he \nwanted to make sure was considered.\n  Subsequent to that, I tried a second time to get those four cleared, \nand an objection was heard from the Senator from Montana because he \nstill was not satisfied with the assurances with regard to his own \njudge for district court position in Montana. I assured him at the time \nwe would continue to work to try to get clearance on that nominee, that \nthere were some objections, some holds that had been lodged against \nthat nominee, and therefore it could not be included in that group.\n  Once I was elected majority leader, in fact, I did continue to work \non those four and others. On the Friday before the Fourth of July \nrecess, we were able to get, preliminarily, 10 judges cleared. There \nwas some last-minute problem with one of those 10, so we still had a \ngroup of nine judges that we had cleared on this side of the aisle, \nbut, again, there was an objection heard on the Democratic side of the \naisle.\n  In an abundance of good effort to try to see if we cannot move some \nof these nominations where there are not, and, in fact, should not be \nobjections, I have decided now I will try to bring up a judge each day \nover the next several days to see if we cannot get them cleared. I \nthink it is a legitimate way. I have tried to do them in a group of \nfour. I have tried to do them in a group of nine. Now I will try to do \nthem one-by-one. Some of these judges--three or four--are supported by \nRepublicans. The others are Democratic nominees. I would go back and \nforth for a while. But, overall, there will be several more that are \nbeing actively supported by the Democrats than by the Republicans.\n\n  Once again, I am trying to be fair in how we do that. My intent would \nbe to begin today with the nominee from Missouri, and go then, on \nWednesday, with a nominee from Louisiana, because this particular \nnominee is a person that serves in the court system--I guess she may be \na supreme court judge in Louisiana--and there is a qualifying deadline \nbetween Wednesday and Friday of this week for her to either seek \nreelection or to know whether she is going to be confirmed by the \nSenate or not. I am trying to move forward in recognition of that \nparticular problem that she has and within the timeframe. Then we would \ngo down the line.\n  I have submitted to the Democratic leader a list of nine judges that \nI would intend to do over this week and next week. And then beyond \nthat, I would continue to work and see basically how things go. If we \nare getting some of these done, we will continue to try to do them. If \nwe hear objections every day, I do not know what else to do. I have \ntried a group of four, a group of nine, and I am trying them one at a \ntime. I feel like my hands would be clean, and I do not see how there \ncould be objection to us not moving these judges.\n  I wanted to lay that predicate and explain what is happening. Some \nfeel that none of these judges should be confirmed. Others, including \nmyself, feel like several of them have been pending for a good long \nwhile, and unless there is a serious problem with the education, or \nqualifications, or ethics, we ought to try to move them. That is what I \nhave been working assiduously to do. I am not doing it just by picking \na name out of the hat. I am carefully looking at the judges and finding \nout if there are any problems, and as we get them cleared we can move \ndown the line. Then I will move to the next judge or judges to see if \nthey are, in fact, qualified.\n  There is no question that, philosophically, I have problems with a \nlot of them. I am not using that as a basis or a guide stick. I am \ntrying to take them up in a logical order to try to get the calendar \nacted on in this regard.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/07/09/senate-section/article/S7503-1", "month": "07", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "09", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7503-S7505]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       UNANIMOUS-CONSENT REQUEST\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nimmediately proceed to executive session to consider Executive Calendar \nNo. 514, the nomination of Gary Fenner, to be a U.S. district judge for \nthe western district of Missouri.\n  I further ask unanimous consent that the nomination be confirmed, the \nmotion to reconsider be laid upon the table, and that any statements \nrelating to the nomination appear at the appropriate place in the \nRecord, that the President be immediately notified of the Senate's \naction, and that the Senate then return to legislative session.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, reserving the right to object. First, let \nme commend the majority leader for his effort to try to resolve this \nimpasse. I believe that he has attempted to act in good faith. He and I \nhave had innumerable conversations about this and have tried to find \nways in which to address it in a meaningful way and a satisfactory way \nto both sides.\n  He mentioned the effort the day we left prior to the July 4 break. \nThrough no fault of his, necessarily, we were left with trying to clear \nthis list while everybody was on airplanes going in about 15 different \ndirections. So it was not our lack of effort or some concerted desire \non the part of Democrats to oppose the list. But given the fact that \nafter the Chamber had cleared and people had gotten on airplanes, as we \nattempted to reach people to see whether we could clear it, it was \nvirtually impossible from a practical point of view.\n  He mentioned the fact that he has tried to bring up small groups and \nhas found that it is difficult to get an agreement on even a small \ngroup, and so he is going to take them individually. Mr. President, the \nissue is not the size of the group, whether it is one, four, or nine. \nThe issue is, what assurance do those who are not on the list, whether \nit is 1 of the remaining 22, or 1 of the remaining 19, or 1 of the \nremaining--in this case it would be 12--that they, too, will have an \nopportunity to have their judge considered?\n  So, earlier today, I discussed with the distinguished majority leader \nwhether or not it would be possible at least to lay out a calendar, \nwhereby every judge could be assured that on a given day during this \nwork period that particular nomination would be considered. The \ndistinguished leader is not able to do that this afternoon. So then we \ntalked about whether or not it would be possible to at least have the \nassurance that all 23 would be considered between now and the August \nrecess. The majority leader again was unable to give me that assurance.\n  Well, then, he did indicate to me that he would be willing to do the \nfirst 17. But I notice on Tuesday, July 16, Mr. Lawrence Kahn of New \nYork, Calendar No. 678, is one of those beyond the first 17. It is in \nthat group that was just passed out of committee in the final six. So \nif he is not willing to do all 23, but is willing then to do 100 \npercent of the Republican nominees--and there are only 3 or 4--and \nleave all of the balance on the Democratic list to be taken up at some \nuncertain time, with no commitment that we are ultimately going to at \nleast be able to try to deal with these issues between now and the \nAugust recess, our colleagues have indicated to me as late as just a \nfew minutes ago that, on that basis, on that limited assurance, they \nare not satisfied that they are going to be able to address their \njudgeships as well, and they are not convinced that this is a \nsatisfactory way to go.\n  I applaud the majority leader for his innovation. I do not think that \nit is necessarily the fact that they were in small groups that was the \nproblem. So taking them up one-by-one may not solve the matter, so long \nas we find the uncertainty about what happens after July 19 and we have \ndealt with the first nine.\n  So, Mr. President, based upon those concerns and the reservations \nexpressed to me by my colleagues, as I\n\n[[Page S7504]]\n\nsaid, just a matter of moments ago, I will have to object to this \nunanimous-consent request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, before we move to the closing script, let me \nrespond to some of the comments made by the distinguished Democratic \nleader.\n  First, I will ask a question. You mentioned a Judge Kahn of New York, \nthat he was not on the list. Is that what the Senator said?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. No. What I said was that the majority leader had \nindicated to me that he was not prepared to consider at this point the \nfinal six judges which were added to the Executive Calendar. Yet, we \nfind on Tuesday, July 16, Calendar No. 678 is one of those judges who \nwere reported out most recently by the Judiciary Committee, and is a \ncomponent of that final six. He happens to be a Republican. Now, I do \nnot imply by that that the majority leader had special design on just \nthis Republican nominee. But if we are willing to do it for the \nRepublican nominee just reported out of committee, it would seem to me \nthat we ought to do it for the five Democrats as well. That was the \nissue I attempted to raise.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, let me comment because I wanted to clarify \nthat. The problem has been that we had, I think, 16 or 17 judges that \nhad been reported out of the Judiciary Committee, and objections had \nbeen heard from any Senators that did not have their judge in that \ngroup of 4 or 9. So in order to not have objections, I guess we would \nhave had to have had all 16 or 17 of them cleared that had been \nreported before June 27. We could not clear them, all 16 or 17 of them, \nso I thought we would get a block of as many as we could. But we are in \na position where any Senator that does not have his cleared is going to \nobject, apparently, to any combination I come up with.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Will the distinguished majority leader yield on that \npoint?\n  Mr. LOTT. Certainly.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Because, for the record, I think we ought to see if we \ncan resolve at least our understanding of where both sides are.\n  We have expressed a desire to work with the majority in terms of \nputting a list together whereby at least a Senator, if not having \ncleared the nominee, at least would know that his nominee would come up \nsometime between now and the August recess.\n  The distinguished leader will acknowledge that we have talked about \nat least scheduling for purposes of consideration a given nominee. \nEveryone recognizes that in order for this system to work, we are going \nto have to have cooperation on both sides.\n  Mr. LOTT. Sure.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. We are not asking today that everybody be cleared. All \nwe are asking is that we have some assurance that every one of the \nnominees on the Executive Calendar will have the opportunity at least \nto be considered. Then we will go to the next step at a later date.\n  Mr. LOTT. If I could continue, Mr. President, the other suggestion \nwas made that all of the so-called Republican nominees are on the list. \nIn fact, I am not all that sure which ones are Republican and which \nones are Democrat. I started this thing off thinking that they were all \nprobably supported by Democrats. For instance, I understand that one \nnot on the list is the nominee from Ohio which maybe is at least \nsupported by Senator DeWine.\n  So I mean, the intent would be to bring it up later on. But I felt \nthat I gave this list for 2 weeks and I did not have time to give four \nor five names for the third week. So that is why I stopped. So there is \nat least one and maybe more that are supported by Republicans. I do not \nreally ask for that. What I try to do is see if there are real holds on \nit; see if they are legitimate. If they have legitimate concerns, I try \nto move on and get the others.\n  Also, if you are ever going to bring these up in such a way that you \ncan bring it up and insist that the Senator or Senators who have \nobjections voice those objections and then be prepared to move them, I \nreally think I need to do that one by one. That is what I am trying to \ndo here. If I bring up all 17, or 16 that were pending before June 27, \nyou can be almost certain that there will be objections heard.\n  So I do not know what to do. I have tried to do it in groups. I have \ntried it singly, and I am going to continue to try to do that.\n  Two other opinions, and then I will yield for other comments.\n  Seven of these new ones were reported next to the last day, I think, \nthat we were in session on Thursday, the 27th. I have not had time to \nlook at all of those. But I am going to. I plan to do that in \nrelatively short order to see what the prospects are. I am prepared to \nmove on to some of those that are not on this list of nine, and it may \nbe that I will continue to try to do one a day at least for a while and \nsee if there is objection. Conversely, if we begin to get some of them \nagreed to, we might try another block.\n  But I am trying to be cooperative. I would like to get as many of \nthese done--I cannot tell you this afternoon that I am going to be able \nto bring up all 23 of them at all.\n\n  One of the problems that we have is we have a lot of work to do; must \ndo work. The Democrats can slow roll us, if they want to. They can stop \nbills, or they can delay bills, or whatever. But there are a certain \nnumber of things that we have to do before we get through this year.\n  I think, also, I am entitled to be given a little bit of benefit of \nthe doubt for a while. We have been keeping our word to each other. I \nam telling you that I am working these nominations. I am going to \ncontinue to work them. And until I do not do something which I tell you \nI am going to do--that is one reason I cannot make a commitment to you \non the 23 because I am not sure I can keep that commitment.\n  So I am saying, give me a little time here. Give me a show of good \nfaith. Give me a little trust. I have nine ready to go. I am going to \ncontinue to do it for a while. I am going to bring up the Louisiana \nnominee tomorrow and see if you object to a Democratically supported \nnominee. Then I am going to bring up the nominee from Colorado, which I \npresume is supported by a lot of Colorado Democrats because I \nunderstand philosophically he is a pretty liberal judge. But he is also \nsupported by Senator Brown.\n  Then I am going to go to the West Virginia judge that is supported \nvery aggressively by the distinguished Senator from West Virginia, \nSenator Byrd.\n  That will take us through this week, and then sort of see where we \nare.\n  If you object to all of them, I will weigh that. If you object to one \nor two of them and let the other two go, we will kind of assess that.\n  The objection has already been heard. I will just say to the \ndistinguished Democratic leader that I understand, and I am going to \ncontinue to work on it for a while. But you know we have a lot of other \nthings that we need to get done, too.\n  I will try again and maybe by tomorrow afternoon your folks will have \na new way of looking at it, and then we might come back to the Missouri \njudge at that point.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, let me emphasis that I want to give the \ndistinguished majority leader plenty of benefit of the doubt, and I \nwant to work with him in good faith. Obviously, he is attempting to \nwork through a number of challenging scheduling questions. I applaud \nhim for making that effort.\n  To the best of my ability, I intend to work with him as closely as I \ncan. He has indicated that he does not know whether we can get through \nthem all. I hope that he would say, ``At least I am going to try.'' \nThat is all I am asking at this point, that the leader attempt to work \nwith me to try to deal with all 23. If we fail for a lot of reasons, we \nmay fail. But I think my colleagues would like very much to know that \nat least at some point between now and the August recess, given the \nfact that we are hoping to cooperate on a whole range of issues--the \ndistinguished leader gave me a two-page, single-spaced list of \nlegislative items that he wishes to bring up between now and the August \nrecess. That is going to take a lot of cooperation on both sides of the \naisle for us to get it done.\n  We have a defense bill that he wants to bring up this week. Hopefully \nwe can work through that.\n  But the degree to which there is bipartisan cooperation has \neverything to\n\n[[Page S7505]]\n\ndo with how much cooperation there is on both sides on issues that we \nboth care about. My colleagues care very deeply about this list of \njudicial nominees.\n  I have said it before, but in 1992, with the same set of \ncircumstances, even in September, I am told, our colleagues--the \nmajority of my Democratic colleagues--passed out 66 district and \ncircuit court judges--66.\n  In this session of Congress, so far it is zero. We have not confirmed \none judge in this entire session of Congress. So, I will not belabor \nthe point, except to say that so far there has been very little \ncooperation.\n  We are on a new watch. I know the majority leader wants to work very \nclosely with us to try to resolve this matter. All I am saying is what \nwe would simply like is his commitment to work with us, at least to \ntake up the 23 and work through them one by one as he has proposed. We \nare not going to object as long as we know that all 23 at least will be \nconsidered.\n  So I expect to work with the leader, and perhaps tomorrow we can make \nsome more progress. But at this point we have some more work to do.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I do not want to belabor it any further at \nthis point except for one point. I understand that he is suggesting \nthat if we are going to get cooperation on the legislative agenda, they \nwould want cooperation on the judicial nominations. I would submit the \nreverse also is true. If we get cooperation on the bills that need to \nbe done for the good of the country--the Department of Defense \nappropriations bill, the foreign operations appropriations bill, the \nTreasury-Postal Service appropriations bill--then that would probably \nmake it a little easier for me to be able to continue to move some of \nthese things. So it works both ways. If we get cooperation on those \nbills, I feel a little more inclined to bear down and say we need to \nmove some of these things.\n  But I want to say again, it is like the legislation: You can only do \nso much in a day or a week. The same thing is true of this. I can only \ngo through the process of seeing what the problems are and seeing if we \ncan get them cleared in a period of time.\n  Also, the last day we went out, I was talking with Senators on the \ntelephone, on airplanes, I tried to get a couple of Senators on the \nsame plane through the cockpit, and had staff waiting when they landed \nto clear the list of 10 that we had. So it is never easy around here. \nBut I am working those, and I can assure the Senator I will continue to \nwork this as long as I feel there is some show of good faith.\n  But I repeat, I tried four, I tried nine, and I am going to try them \none a day for the next 4 days, and we will see where we are. But we can \nkeep talking and see what kind of cooperation we get on the bills, and \nthen you can see what kind of cooperation we get on the judges, and \nmaybe we can go forward together.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/07/09/senate-section/article/S7503-2", "month": "07", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "09", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7505]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  ORDERS FOR WEDNESDAY, JULY 10, 1996\n\n  Mr. LOTT.
