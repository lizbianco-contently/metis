Mr. President, yesterday, Treasury Secretary Robert \nRubin sent a letter to the congressional leadership warning that a \nrefusal to pass an increase in the debt limit by November 6 would force \nthe Treasury Department to take extraordinary actions in the coming \ndays, actions for which the American taxpayers would foot the bill.\n  The Secretary indicated that these moves might include not fully \ninvesting the Federal Employees Retirement System, the Government \nSecurities Investment Fund, the G fund, calling back Treasury cash \nbalances held in our depository banks, and suspending the issuance of \nsavings bonds.\n  These defensive actions, regrettably, may become necessary under the \ncircumstances.\n  Some weeks ago, the Speaker of the House suggested that congressional \nRepublicans might find it acceptable for the U.S. Government to default \non its obligations if it proves to be useful leverage in the coming \nbudget battles. Unfortunately, these comments, once dismissed as \npolitical posturing, now could be prophetic.\n  Mr. President, Secretary Rubin's warnings ought to be heeded. \nPolitical considerations should not dictate congressional action on the \ndebt ceiling.\n  The debt limit is serious economic business. It should not be a part \nof the budget debate. The reputation of this Nation throughout the \nworld would be irrevocably damaged if the full faith and credit of the \nU.S. Government becomes shaky and suspect.\n  Because this is such a serious matter, I was disappointed to read in \nyesterday's papers the characterization by the majority leader that \nSecretary Rubin's credibility and integrity are somehow in question in \nthis debate.\n  Nothing could be further from the truth.\n  Secretary Rubin is engaged in a critical effort to discharge his \nresponsibilities to the taxpayers by preventing the U.S. Government \nfrom defaulting on its debt obligations for the first time in more than \n200 years.\n  Moreover, Secretary Rubin has made repeated efforts to meet with the \nRepublican leadership and to make other senior Treasury officials \navailable to answer questions and clarify disputed numbers.\n  No one has credibly disputed what the Treasury has said. It seems to \nme clear that these attacks on Secretary Rubin represent a classic case \nof shooting the messenger.\n  Meanwhile, there seems to be an ongoing effort on the other side of \nthe aisle to distract the public from the real issue in the debt limit \ndebate--namely, that a default will cause taxpayers to pay for \ngenerations to come in higher interest rates on the trillions of \ndollars in public debt which this Nation must finance in national and \ninternational capital markets.\n\n[[Page S 16450]]\n\n  It is my understanding that a meeting between President Clinton and \nRepublican leaders has been scheduled today to discuss this very \nmatter. I certainly hope that this can be the first step in an effort \nto resolve the dispute over the debt limit outside the political \ncontext in which we will debate our very real differences over the \nbudget.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a copy of Secretary Rubin's letter to \nthe Speaker be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                   Department of the Treasury,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, October 31, 1995.\n     Hon. Newt Gingrich,\n     Speaker of the House, House of Representatives, Washington, \n         DC.\n       Dear Mr. Speaker: In anticipation of our meeting tomorrow I \n     want to provide information that you should have as \n     background for your consideration of our request for a prompt \n     increase in the debt limit.\n       First, I have set forth in an appendix both our current \n     projections and a history of our projections over the past \n     several months.\n       Second, I want to make clear that if Congress fails to act \n     by Wednesday, November 1, it will disrupt our normal auction \n     process and could force Treasury to take additional actions \n     that involve the interests of federal retirees, commercial \n     banks, and purchasers of savings bonds.\n       As you know from my letter of October 24, and as we \n     discussed in detail with your staff yesterday, the Treasury \n     Department's normal quarterly refunding auctions are \n     scheduled to be announced tomorrow, November 1. The auctions \n     themselves are scheduled to be held during the week of \n     November 6, and settlement is scheduled for November 15 and \n     16.\n       There may well be significant costs of disrupting our usual \n     Treasury auction schedule. If there has been no increase in \n     the debt limit by tomorrow morning, our announcement must put \n     prospective bidders on notice that the auctions might have to \n     be delayed or even cancelled. After such a contingent \n     announcement, ``when issued'' trading in the securities to be \n     auctioned cannot occur. Dealers may be less able to pre-\n     market securities, and their risk of participation in the \n     auction may thus be increased, raising the costs of the \n     borrowing.\n       Should Congress fail to take action to raise the debt \n     ceiling by November 6, we will be required once again to \n     depart from our best financial management practices by \n     canceling the scheduled auctions, and may be forced to take \n     further steps to ensure that outstanding debt remains within \n     the limit and that we have cash available to pay the \n     Government's obligations.\n       As I have indicated in my previous letters, there are a \n     limited number of actions we may be forced to take many of \n     which have legal and practical implications. One such example \n     would include Treasury's action to stop reinvesting the so-\n     called G-Fund (the Federal Employees Retirement System's \n     Government Securities Investment Fund). Securities held in \n     the G-Fund mature and are reinvested on a daily basis, and \n     the governing law provides for an automatic restoration of \n     any lost interest when reinvestment resumes. Because of the \n     inherent volatility of financing flows, such action may be \n     required even prior to the week of November 6th. Furthermore, \n     it will be necessary to call back Treasury cash balances held \n     in our depositary banks. This action will inconvenience those \n     commercial banks with whom the Federal Government does \n     business.\n       Also, should Congress fail to act, Treasury may be forced \n     to suspend the issuance of Savings Bonds--an action that \n     would not only require us to send notices to the 80,000 \n     issuing agents, but also would disrupt millions of Americans' \n     use of a safe and convenient investment for their savings.\n       While these actions can provide some very limited relief, \n     at the cost of creating significant dislocations and \n     anxieties, it should be clearly understood that they will not \n     be sufficient to substitute fully for the funding that we \n     would ordinarily raise through the regular mid-November \n     refinancings and that should be announced tomorrow. Stated \n     another way, these temporary actions will not satisfy the \n     continuing need for cash to fund the obligations and \n     operations of the Government after November 14. Absent \n     extraordinary steps, Congress must increase the debt limit \n     obligations maturing November 15 and 16.\n       Finally, you should know that there are various other \n     measures Treasury has been reviewing to avoid default should \n     Congress not increase the debt limit by November 15, \n     including actions involving the Civil Service Retirement \n     Fund, but all such measures present uncertainties involving \n     serious legal and practical issues and have significant costs \n     and other adverse consequences.\n       Furthermore, the U.S. government's need for financing will \n     not end on November 15 and 16. The financing calendar we \n     distributed last week, and discussed in detail with your \n     staff yesterday, showed four auctions in the last two weeks \n     of November, and additional cash management bills may be \n     needed. Successful completion of those auctions is critical \n     to raising cash to make vital benefit payments on December 1 \n     and during the week of December 4. As we have mentioned \n     before, the months of October, November and the first half of \n     December traditionally have very large seasonal cash deficits \n     due to the absence of any large tax payment dates.\n       You and other members of the leadership have raised the \n     prospect that Congress might enact a temporary debt limit \n     increase, and we have expressed our total availability to \n     work toward that end. Last Friday, at the President's \n     direction, I proposed that the debt limit be increased by $85 \n     billion, to $4.985 trillion. I would hope to discuss this \n     proposal, and any other approaches you might have, at our \n     meeting tomorrow.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  Robert E. Rubin,\n     Secretary of the Treasury.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/11/01/senate-section/article/S16449-5", "month": "11", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "01", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S16450]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I wish to elaborate on some remarks I \nmade yesterday about the objection pending against the short-term \nextension of the Middle East Peace Facilitation Act.\n  Yesterday, the distinguished majority leader came to the Senate floor \nand said that although he would like to pass the extension, it is being \nblocked by the chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee. The \nmajority leader went on to say that the Senator from North Carolina is \nwithin his rights to block this legislation, and indeed he is because \nevery Senator has that right.\n  I want this morning to ask the distinguished chairman of the Foreign \nRelations Committee to consider changing his mind about holding up the \nMiddle East Peace Facilitation Act.\n  I spoke yesterday and indicated that in July a group of Members of \nthis body joined together, Republican and Democrat, in cosponsoring a \nbill which would extend the Middle East Peace Facilitation Act for 18 \nmonths, and virtually every Member joined in expressing support for \nthat course.\n  Here we are in November, and the act has been suspended as of last \nnight, which means that economic aid to the Palestinians committed to \nby this Nation has stopped. The PLO office in Washington will be forced \nto close its doors. And as my colleagues know, this is because of an \nunrelated issue that is going on. That unrelated issue is the dispute \nover the State Department authorization bill.\n  Negotiations have been ongoing on that bill between Senator Kerry and \nSenator Helms. It is my understanding that at present they are \nstalemated, but because of failure to reach an agreement, the Foreign \nRelations Committee has been virtually shut down. I think this is wrong \nin the interest of U.S. foreign policy and of the Senate weighing in on \nthese issues.\n  We have been unable to take up any ambassadorial nominations in \nbusiness meetings for a period of weeks, to report them out to the full \nSenate for confirmation. At the present time, there are at least 18 \nambassadorial nominees waiting to have their nominations considered by \nthe committee. They include nominees to serve in some of the most \nimportant countries in the world.\n  The nominee for China has had a hearing, but is pending action in the \ncommittee; the same is true for the nominees for Pakistan and \nIndonesia. These include Jim Sasser, Tom Simons and Stapleton Roy. \nNominees for other countries are waiting. South Africa: James Joseph is \nwaiting. Sri Lanka: Peter Burleigh is waiting. Thailand: \n\n[[Page S 16451]]\n\n William Itoh is waiting. Cambodia: Kenneth Quinn is waiting. Malaysia: \nJohn Malott is waiting. Oman: Frances Cook is waiting. Lebanon: Richard \nJones is waiting. The Cameroons: Carl Twining is waiting. The Marshall \nIslands: Joan Plaisted is waiting. Fiji: Don Gevirtz is waiting.\n  Also on hold are nominations for special adviser on the New \nIndependent States, James Collins, and United States coordinator for \nAsia Pacific Economic Cooperation, Sandra Kristoff.\n  In addition, 273 Foreign Service officers who have been nominated for \nstandard promotions are on hold. So we have 273 Foreign Service \nofficers on hold. We have 18 ambassadorial appointments on hold, at \nleast 5 of them considered to be critical, like those for Pakistan or \nChina.\n  Now, when we do not have an Ambassador in the country, U.S. interests \ndo not receive the attention that they deserve. In some countries, this \nis more critical than others. Probably the most critical at this time \nis China. And Senator Sasser, who could have been in New York this past \nweek to participate in the summit between President Clinton and \nPresident Jiang Zemin of China--could have been--was not.\n  I think the American people deserve to have their interests \nrepresented abroad. So by failing to confirm Ambassadors, the Senate is \nnot doing its job to help protect U.S. interests abroad. Not only do \nour interests suffer, but I think the lives of a number of hard-working \nand dedicated Americans are put on hold. These are people who, often at \nconsiderable personal risk, serve the American people with pride and \ndistinction overseas.\n  Last night I had a phone call from one of them. He said, ``Can you \njust tell me when I might be confirmed?'' And I had to say, ``No, I'm \nsorry. I can't tell you.''\n  Earlier, I had another call from a nominee who had his house on the \nmarket and had received an offer on the home. Does he sell it or does \nhe not sell it? ``Sorry. I can't help there.''\n  Mr. President, this is no way to run a railroad, let alone the \nGovernment of the most powerful country in the world.\n  There are also two extremely important arms control treaties that are \nawaiting Foreign Relations Committee action: The START II Treaty and \nthe Chemical Weapons Convention.\n  Let me mention what Start II does. The START II Treaty, signed by the \nBush administration and not yet ratified by this Congress, is the \nfarthest reaching arms reduction treaty ever signed in the history of \nthis Nation. It will require the United States and Russia to eliminate \nliterally thousands of intercontinental ballistic missiles, including \nthose which carry multiple warheads. The treaty would also eliminate \nmissile silos and testing and training launchers.\n  The Foreign Relations Committee held extensive hearings on the START \nII Treaty both in this Congress and during the 103d Congress. We have \nheard from the administration, from military officers and from outside \nexperts, virtually all urging that we ratify this treaty.\n  I know of no significant opposition to the ratification of the START \nII Treaty. Nevertheless, the committee is unable to begin consideration \nof it. This is wrong.\n  The same is true of the Chemical Weapons Convention. Let me tell you \nwhat the Chemical Weapons Convention does. The convention, also signed \nby the Bush administration, will ban an entire class of weapons of mass \ndestruction. It will make it harder and more costly for proliferators \nand terrorists to acquire chemical weapons. It will create an intrusive \nmonitoring regime that will make it very difficult for signatories to \nconceal violations of the convention.\n  The Chemical Weapons Convention has been signed by 159 countries and \nratified by 38 to date, yet the U.S. Senate has still not had the \nopportunity to consider the treaty. The Foreign Relations Committee has \nhad hearings on the convention, and it can be considered at any time. \nBut, once again, the committee has been prevented from carrying out its \nduty.\n  Should this happen? As I said earlier, it is any Member's right to \nstop a piece of legislation, but when you have hundreds of Foreign \nService officers, 18 Ambassadors, and two treaties held hostage to a \npiece of legislation that is not related, one has to begin to consider \nwhat effects this has.\n  Mr. President, one of the things that I learned in my brief stay here \nis that what goes around, comes around, and that it does not make good, \nlogical, long-term sense to engage in holds when this can easily be \nreplicated at another time but in the same place by the opposition \nparty.\n  This committee, the Foreign Relations Committee, has been through \nsome of the most painful and hotly contested foreign policy issues of \nour time: the Vietnam war, aid to Central American rebels and sanctions \nagainst South Africa. But never during all that time, to the best of my \nknowledge, has the committee been shut down and ceased to function. \nNow, on the basis of a dispute about the bureaucratic reorganization of \nour foreign policy institutions, the conduct of the U.S. foreign policy \nis being put on hold.\n  I believe this is wrong. I believe it is irresponsible. I believe it \nis a dereliction of our duties as U.S. Senators. There simply is no \njustification for curtailing the entire role of the Senate Foreign \nRelations Committee in the conduct of U.S. foreign policy over one \nsingle reorganizational issue.\n  Pursuant to the unanimous consent agreement of September 29, Senator \nHelms and Senator Kerry have been engaging in serious negotiations to \ntry to reach an agreement. Their staffs have met repeatedly over the \nlast month. I am hopeful that progress can be made.\n  So at this time I would like, respectfully, and with a great deal of \nfriendship, to call upon the chairman of the committee to withdraw his \nobjection to consideration of a short-term extension of the Middle East \nPeace Facilitation Act, to allow the committee to take action on START \nII and the Chemical Weapons Convention, to report out the 18 \nambassadorial nominations and 273 Foreign Service promotions, and to \ncontinue negotiating toward an agreement on the State Department \nauthorization bill.\n  I thank the Chair. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DORGAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/11/01/senate-section/article/S16450-2", "month": "11", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "01", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S16451-S16455]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         BUDGET RECONCILIATION\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I yield myself such time as I may consume \non the hour that has been allocated to the minority leader.\n  Mr. President, today the Senate will select conferees to go to \nconference on the reconciliation bill. Conferees from the Senate and \nconferees from the House will meet and debate and try to reach an \nagreement on what kind of a reconciliation bill will be passed from the \nCongress to the President.\n  This all does not mean very much to the American people, the words \n``reconciliation,'' ``conferences.'' What means something to the \nAmerican people will be what effect will it have on their lives, what \neffect will it have on their health care system, on Medicare, Medicaid, \nthe ability to send their child to college, on young 3-, 4-, 5-year-old \nkids who are in Head Start--what effect will this have on all of those \npeople. That is what means something to the American people.\n  The debate that people have heard coming from this Chamber is a \ndebate not about one side of the aisle that wants to be obstructionist \nand the other side that wants to do something wrong, it is about people \nwho have different views of what the priorities ought to be.\n  One thing that is certain about this Senate meeting this year is that \n100 years from now, all the Members of this Senate will be dead and the \nonly record we will have left that historians can evaluate from our \nservice is to evaluate what we spent the public's money on and, \ntherefore, what we felt was valuable and important and would advance \nthe interests of this country. People can tell something about our \nvalue system by looking at the Federal budget. On what did we elect to \nspend the public's money? How did we invest it? How did we spend it? \nThat is what historians will be able to use to view what we felt was \nimportant.\n  The priority in this reconciliation bill by the Republican Party is \nto say, ``Let's have a tax cut.'' I thought the priority when we \nstarted this year was one that said, ``Let's balance the budget.'' In \nfact, we had people on the floor \n\n[[Page S 16452]]\n\nof the Senate saying we must change the U.S. Constitution to require us \nto balance the budget. Of course, the budget can be balanced without \nchanging the Constitution.\n  We have people in this Chamber who call themselves conservatives who \nview the Constitution as merely a rough draft, something they can \nimprove upon every single day. Although I do not see many Madisons, \nMasons, Jeffersons, Franklins, or Washingtons around to contribute to \nchange this Constitution, we have had well over 100 proposals since the \nfirst of January in this year to change the U.S. Constitution.\n  The priority at the start of the year was we must eliminate the \nFederal budget deficit. In fact, we must ensure that happens by \nchanging the U.S. Constitution. And then the act by which that happens, \nthe budget and the reconciliation bill, comes to the floor of the \nSenate, and we discover that the priority is different than that. The \npriority is a tax cut, a substantial part of which will go to the \nwealthiest Americans.\n  The priority is to add money to the defense bill that the President \nand the Secretary of Defense and the chiefs of the branches of the \nservices said they did not want. Those are the priorities, and that is \nwhat this debate is about.\n  Let me just put up a couple of charts to describe some of the \nelements of this debate.\n  The Head Start Program. We know the Head Start Program works. Anybody \nthat has ever toured a Head Start center, and I have toured plenty, and \nsat on the little chairs and had lunch with 3-, 4-, 5-year-olds and \nwatched them do their art projects, watched them learn about health, \nwatched them begin to get a head start, because they come from homes of \ndisadvantage and often poverty, watch them feel that this contributes \nto their lives and having us know it does, we understand this program \nworks.\n  The priority now is to say, ``We're sorry, we can't afford the Head \nStart Program the way it is,'' so roughly 55,000 kids will be dropped \nfrom the program, and every single one of those kids has a name and has \na hope and gets some advantage from this program. But we are told we \ncannot afford that. Instead, we are told, Let's pump nearly half a \nbillion dollars into lead production for 20 more B-2 bombers that will \ncost us $31 billion, B-2 bombers, incidentally, that the Secretary of \nDefense has not asked for; B-2 bombers that the Department of Defense \nhas not requested.\n  So we say Head Start does not quite matter as much; B-2 bombers, let \nus build them, even though those who would fly them and use them have \nnot asked for them.\n  Job training for displaced workers. These are people who have lost \njobs but want to find jobs and get new skills to do it, half a billion \ndollars cut from that, which means you will have more unemployment, not \nless. You will have less opportunity, not more, for people whom we want \nto put back on the payrolls. And at the same time we say we just cannot \nafford the kind of money that is necessary to get people ready to go \nback into a job, we say, By the way, let's gear up for a star wars \nprogram. It will cost about $48 billion. That has not been asked for by \nthe Defense Department either. There is no demonstration that we need \nthis program, but we are told, ``Let's stick $375 million in it this \nyear and demand it be deployed in 1999,'' including a space-based \ncomponent of a star wars program because we can afford that. Again, the \nSecretary of Defense and the armed services have not asked for it, but \nwe can afford that, we are told.\n  Mr. President, $1.4 billion invested in kids and that goes to helping \nkids get to college, financial aid to help middle-income families send \ntheir kids to college, so we say we are going to make it more expensive \nfor middle-income families to send their kids to school.\n  But we say when confronted with the question, shall we build an \namphibious assault ship this year, the answer in this Congress was--\nsome said no, we should not build one. Others said we should build two \nof them. Do you know what the answer was in this Congress? ``Let's \nbuild both. Let's build one for $900 million and one for $1.3 billion, \nbecause we're loaded, we've got all the money in the world when it \ncomes to this. There is no sense being frugal here. Let's spend money \nlike it is Saturday night and the town's opened up for us and we have \nthe parent's checkbook here.'' We can buy all this, despite the fact no \none asked for it, no one requested it.\n  And there is more. Mr. President, $989 million from veterans' health \ncare, 1 million fewer outpatient visits, 46,000 fewer hospitalizations \nbecause we have to cut there, we are told. This is the second \namphibious assault ship. We can order that. In fact, we can buy both of \nthem, a billion dollars, an amphibious assault ship that was not \nordered and a cutback on a promise made to veterans before they went to \nfight for this country's freedom.\n  Low-income home energy assistance. That does not sound like much, but \nthat is what keeps people warm in the winter. Poor people who have no \nmoney, often poor elderly people with no money who live in the frigid \nclimates of this country rely on this to keep their homes heated. We \ncannot afford that, but let us buy six more F-15's, despite the fact \nthe Secretaries of Defense and Air Force have not asked for them. We \nnow have 1,103. Let us stick that in. That is $311 million. It is more \nimportant to buy jet fighters nobody asked for than it is to help old \npeople and poor people keep warm in the winter.\n  There is a $137 million cut for critical accounts dealing with Indian \nproblems on reservations; $140 million spent for 14 Warrior \nhelicopters. We now have 360. The Defense Department did not ask for \nthese, but they were put back in the budget and they said we should buy \n14 of these helicopters, $140 million. And then we are told we have to \ncut $137 million for these crucial services on Indian reservations and \nthat deal with kids, mostly Indian children--education, health, and a \nwhole range of other services for young children who want a chance and \nwant a start.\n  Somebody is going to look at all this and say, That is a bunch of \npointy-headed liberalism. It is not about liberalism, it is about \nmaking choices. We are told what we are going to spend in this Chamber. \nThe question is what do we spend it on? Do you buy an amphibious \nassault ship that was not asked for? Or do you cut back, as a result of \nthat, on veterans' health benefits? Do you decide to kick kids off Head \nStart and build B-2 bombers that nobody asked for? That is the priority \nin this reconciliation bill. That is what is wrong with it.\n\n  I want to read a list, just so that people can be disabused of who \nthe big spenders are. We are told the big spenders are the Democrats, \nthe folks who always want to spend money. This is a list of what is \nadded to the defense bill, mostly by folks on that side of the aisle--\nthings that were not asked for, requested, needed, or ordered by the \nDefense Department. I will read the list: 60 Blackhawk helicopters; \nLongbow helicopters; Kiowa Warrior helicopters; M109A6 howitzer \nmodifications; Ml tank upgrades; heavy tactical vehicles, trucks that \nwere not requested; AV-8B fighter aircraft; B-2 bombers; F/A-18C/D \nfighter aircraft; C-135 cargo aircraft modifications; Comanche \nhelicopters' R ship self-defense R national missile defense, or \nstar wars; T-39N trainer aircraft; EA-6 strike aircraft modifications; \nLPD-17 amphibious ship; F-16's, F-15's; WC-130 cargo aircraft; LHD \namphibious assault ship.\n  None of these things was asked for, and all of them were ordered by \nthis Congress--$5.2 billion to spend money on things we do not need, \nmoney we do not have on things we do not need. This by conservatives, \nby people who call others big spenders?\n  Well, this is all about priorities. It is about health care. It is \nabout education. It is about agriculture. It is about the Head Start \nProgram. We are going to have some votes today in the Senate on \ninstructing conferees because the conferees will be appointed now to \ndiscuss the differences between the House bill and the Senate bill. It \nis between the far right and the extreme right. That is where the \nmodification will be made. This will be a compromise between the far \nright and extreme right, and it will be sent to the President, and this \nwill be vetoed, and then we will get some serious negotiations, I \nexpect.\n  One vote we will have today is priorities with respect to Medicare. \nThe \n\n[[Page S 16453]]\n\nMedicare Program, I think, is an important program. We, on the \nDemocratic side of the aisle, understand full well that the budget must \nbe balanced. We understand that the credibility of Government is in \nserious question. We understand that, and we need to do the things that \nsolve problems for this country and for the American people.\n  But we also understand there are some things we have done in this \ncountry that have been good, which advanced this country's interest. \nMedicare is one of them.\n  It is interesting to me that 97 percent of the Republicans voted \nagainst Medicare when initially proposed in the U.S. Senate. Now they \nare saying they are going to save Medicare. Generally, that would not \nbe very believable, and it is probably less believable now because \nSpeaker Gingrich last week said:\n\n       Now, we don't get rid of it in round 1 because we don't \n     think that that's politically smart and we don't think that \n     is the right way to go through a transition. But we believe \n     it is going to wither on the vine because we think people are \n     voluntarily going to leave it.\n\n  That is what is at work here. Some people say what they mean in an \noff-guarded moment, and that is what happened here. In a speech to a \nBlue Cross/Blue Shield audience, the Speaker told us what his \nimpression of Medicare was.\n  We are going to offer an amendment on the instructions to conferees \nthat says, look, why do we not decide on this reconciliation issue. If \nyou are going to have a tax cut, some of us think we ought to balance \nthe budget first and talk about tax cuts later. If you are going to \ninsist on a tax cut, why do you not at least limit the tax cut?\n  We have offered proposals before. We can limit it to people whose \nincomes are under a quarter of a million dollars a year. At least limit \nit to that. And you can use the savings from that, about $50 billion \nover 7 years, to reduce the cut in the Medicare Program, much of which \nwill hurt some of the lowest-income senior citizens in this country, \nwho, as a result of this reconciliation bill, will pay more for \nMedicare and get less health care.\n  We will offer that motion today to at least limit the tax cut, at \nleast limit it to working families. At least limit it so we are not \ngiving very big tax cuts to people making $1 million or $5 million or \n$10 million a year, and use the savings from that to try to reduce the \nhit on the Medicare Program.\n  Someone will say, ``Well, why are you discriminating against somebody \nwho makes $5 million a year?'' I am not. God bless them. I think it is \nwonderful. They have done very well in recent years. Their increases in \nincome have been astronomical.\n  The upper 1 percent of the American income earners have had an \nenormously beneficial period. Most Americans have not. Sixty percent of \nthe American families are now earning less money than they were 20 \nyears ago. Not the top 1 percent, or 5 percent; they have had an \nastronomical increase in income. They have benefited substantially from \nthis income system of ours.\n  While I think working families deserve a tax cut, I think we ought \nnot to provide a tax cut at the moment. I think we ought to balance the \nbudget first. Then I think working families deserve a tax cut. I see no \ncompelling national need to cut benefits for the oldest and poorest \ncitizens so we can provide a tax cut for some of the richest citizens \nin America.\n  We are going to provide another opportunity this afternoon to vote, \nand we will likely have a motion on instructing conferees on something \nthat happened on the floor Friday that was just mindboggling. The last \namendment passed by the Senate on reconciliation was an amendment that \ndeals with the Social Security issue. It takes an amount of money on \nthe Social Security issue--about $12 billion--that will be presumably \nsaved by having a lower COLA, and uses that to fund a series of changes \nthat was offered as a result of the Roth amendment.\n  Well, the $12 billion, it is clear, comes out of the savings in \nSocial Security. By law, that cannot be used for other purposes in the \nunified budget. That is what the law requires.\n  We raised a point of order, and Senator Graham inquired of the Chair \nwhether the Social Security outlay reductions were used as offsets. The \nChair responded that it was ``not in a position to answer that \nquestion.'' Everybody else in the Chamber was in a position to answer \nthat question. Anybody who could read could answer that. But, from a \nparliamentary standpoint, the Chair said he was ``not in the position \nto answer that question.''\n  The Budget Committee chairman stated, ``I am satisfied with the \nruling of the Chair.'' In other words, he was satisfied that the Chair \nis not in a position to answer that question. The result was that the \nRoth amendment took $12 billion from the Social Security accounts and \nbrings it over so it funds the Roth amendment. That is what happened \nwith that. We will likely have a motion to instruct this afternoon that \nwill try to right that wrong.\n  I want, just for a couple of moments, to discuss in a broader context \nthe issues that I think most concerns the American people. A lot of \nfolks, as I said, do not spend day-to-day to understand reconciliation \nbills and budget bills and conference committees. What people in this \ncountry understand is whether the system in America works in their \ninterest. Is this a tide that lifts all boats, an economic system that \nhelps everybody? Or is this an economic system where the rich get \nricher and the poor get poorer and there is a distribution of income \nthat is not fair?\n  The challenge and opportunity for all of us, I think, that lies \nahead, is to try to find a mechanism by which this economic system \nworks for everybody once again.\n  We have seen statistics about America's economic health. Every month, \nwe are told the statistics on consumption describe that our economy is \nmoving right along. Boy, if you take a look at consumption, consumption \nis up; therefore, America is doing better. It seems to me that a \nmeasure of economic health in our country is not whether or not we are \nconsuming more or less, it is whether we are producing. Consumption, \nnot production, is a barometer of economic health. Production relates \nto wages. If you have good jobs in the productive sector, productive \njobs, especially manufacturing jobs that pay good wages, that means you \nadvance the economic interests of everybody in this country.\n  Take a look at what is happening to wages in this country. We talk \nabout GDP, which means nothing. Every quarter they trot out GDP \nfigures, every month consumption figures, and it seems to me they are \nusing barometers that mean very little to the economic circumstances of \nworking families.\n  The GDP increases. The stock market goes up. Productivity is on the \nincrease. Corporate profits are up. Guess what? American wages are down \nand have been down.\n  Some information from MBG Information Services, October 31: \nCompensation to all U.S. workers grew at its slowest pace on record in \nJuly to September. If you take a look at the bottom quadrant of \nworkers, what you find is a circumstance where they are earning less \nmoney now than they were some 20 years ago.\n  There was a piece in the New Yorker done by John Cassidy recently \nthat was very interesting and I think describes some of the problems in \nthis country and some of the concerns that people have. He talks about \nthe average American. He said if you were to line all Americans up in a \nrow, put all Americans in one row, from the wealthiest over here to the \npoorest over here, and then pick right in the middle and say, ``You are \nMr. and Mrs. Average, the middle person in America, you are right in \nthe middle, you are middle-income, middle America,'' that person in \nSeptember 1979 was earning $498 a week; in September 1995, when you \nadjust for inflation, that same person was earning $475 a week. In 16 \nyears, that person has lost about $100 a month in real wages.\n  Now, that is the middle of the line. We know that 60 percent of the \nAmerican families who sit down for supper tonight and start talking \nabout their circumstance will understand they are working harder for \nless money than they did 20 years ago.\n  I talked about the middle of the line. After 16 years they have lost \n$100 a month in real wages. Now we will talk about the upper side of \nthe line, the top \n\n[[Page S 16454]]\n\n1 percent on that end of the people you have lined up--the top 1 \npercent.\n  Between 1977 and 1989, the years we have numbers for, their average \nincomes rose from $323,000 to $576,000 per person. That is the top 1 \npercent. They went, in about a 12-year period, from $323,000 to \n$576,000, or a 78-percent increase. It is the average working person \nwho finds himself $100 a month worse off after 15 and 20 years, but the \ntop people at the top 1 percent find themselves far better off with \nspectacular increases in income.\n  This is at a time when corporate profits are up, productivity is on \nthe rise, the stock market reaches new gains, new highs, and wages keep \nfalling.\n  Is it any wonder that the average American family is a little \ndisaffected? The fact is, they find themselves working harder and \ngetting less. One of the things I think is most interesting is we are \ntalking a lot about the fiscal policy budget deficit, and we should. It \nought to be balanced. We ought to deal with that. We ought to solve \nthat problem.\n  Do many Americans know that the merchandise trade deficit in this \nhistory is higher this year than the fiscal policy deficit? You cannot \nfind more than four people in the Senate that will come and talk about \nit.\n  Let me say that again: Our merchandise trade deficit is higher than \nour fiscal policy deficit in this coming year.\n  What does that mean when you have a trade deficit? It means you are \nshipping jobs overseas. We will hit nearly $190 to $200 billion \nmerchandise trade deficit this year. What that means is American jobs \nare leaving. That means we are buying from foreign countries.\n  We have decided an economic strategy is fine as long as profits are \non the way up. As long as productivity goes up and the stock market \ngoes up, wages can go down and jobs can go overseas because we measure \neconomic health by what we consume, not what we produce. We measure \neconomic progress by what happened to the GDP, not what has happened to \nthe American family.\n  I do not know how anyone in this country can view an economic system \nthrough the prism that says that when the American family is doing \nworse and losing money and working harder, but if the consumption \nfigures are up and if the GDP figures are up, America is in better \nshape. That is simply not the case.\n  We need one of these days soon to bring legislation to the floor of \nthe Senate and have an honest-to-goodness debate about the center pole \nof this tentative economic policy--that is trade and related issues--to \ntry to determine what really advances American economic interests.\n  I will bring some legislation on the subject of NAFTA to the floor of \nthe Senate at some point in the future. NAFTA is part of this trade \ndeficit problem. Two years ago we had all of these economists flailing \ntheir arms around Washington, DC, saying if we would only pass a free-\ntrade agreement with Mexico, we would have 270,000 new American jobs.\n  Well, we passed a free trade agreement with Mexico--not with my vote, \nbut it was passed. We had a $2 billion trade surplus with Mexico at the \ntime. Two years later, our trade deficit this year with Mexico will be \naround $17 billion. We went from a $2 billion surplus to a $17 billion \ndeficit.\n  What does that mean? It means jobs are leaving this country. What are \nwe importing from Mexico that causes that deficit? The very thing that \nrepresents the foundation for good jobs in this country--automobiles, \nautomobile parts, electronics. The very thing that represents good jobs \nand good wages in our country are being exported out, transported out \non a wholesale basis.\n  We have to construct a different economic system. It is not, in my \njudgment, in this country's interest to allow multinational \ncorporations to describe their economic interests as consistent with \nthe economic interests of the American family. It is their economic \ninterest to produce in Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, Indonesia, and Malaysia \nand ship the product they produce to Pittsburgh, Fargo, Denver, and Los \nAngeles. That increases profits for them. It is not in our economic \ninterest. It might be in the short-term interest of the consumer who \ncan presumably--not necessarily factually, but presumably--buy some of \nthose products for less. It is not in the interests of consumers who \nwill lose their jobs because their jobs left this country as a result \nof a trade strategy that is bankrupting America.\n  We will have a lot of votes and a lot of debate about priorities on \nthe floor of the Senate today and in the coming weeks with respect to \nthe reconciliation bill--what do we spend money on, what do we not \nspend money on. That is fine. That is the way it should be. Those are \nlegitimate areas of discussion between Republicans and Democrats.\n  My hope is at the end of the day, perhaps, we will have reached a \ncompromise that we all think is good for the country, a fiscal policy \nthat will lead to a balanced budget. But even if we do that, and even \nif we reach a compromise, and even if the President signs that \ncompromise, we will not have achieved the job of setting things right \nin the economic order of this country.\n  We will do that only when we address the larger questions that cause \nthis family, this family that is in the middle of the line of American \nearners, from the richest to the poorest, this family right in the \nmiddle that finds themselves working harder but after 15 years earning \nless, finds themselves after those years between 1979 and 1995, finds \nthemselves after those years $100 a month behind where they started.\n  Balancing the budget will help, but it will not solve that problem. \nThat problem relates to, I think, more endemic economic problems in \nthis country. We have to, it seems to me, decide one of these days as \nDemocrats and Republicans, to address these questions.\n  I have said previously there are two major challenges that I think \nmost Americans now confront in this country. One is the economic \nchallenge. That is the challenge to get America to grow again in which \nit provides opportunities to all Americans--not just the wealthiest, \nbut to all Americans--so we are talking about an economic system that \nrewards all who seek those rewards and are willing to expend effort for \nthose rewards.\n  Second is the issue of the diminution of values in this country. That \nrelates to the coarseness we see on television that has been described \nby others recently, the violence on television that I have described \nrecently, and a whole range of things.\n  Some of these problems, economic and values issues, can and should \nand must be addressed here in the Congress. It must be a product of \ndebate in our country generally. Some of them cannot be addressed by \nCongress, cannot be addressed by public-sector debate in the House or \nthe Senate, and must be addressed in the family, in the home, in the \ncommunity, in the neighborhood. All of us, it seems to me, need to take \nresponsibility to do that.\n  While we attempt to address the thorny issues of deficit reduction, a \nfiscal policy program that will work for the benefit of this country in \nthe future, and while I hope we will attempt, following that, to \naddress the issue of trade, fair trade, and the issue of trying to \nadvance the economic interests of workers with good jobs and good wages \nin the future, while we do all that, it seems to me it would be helpful \nif all of us could call on the American people to join in our common \ninterest.\n  As I said previously, we are going to have an Olympics next year in \nAtlanta. I bet we all are going to sit on the edge of our chairs \ncheering for the people wearing the red, white, and blue. We want \nAmerican athletes to win. That is a wonderful thing: team spirit and \nnationalism and pride.\n  The fact is, the economic competition in the world is not unlike the \nOlympics in a lot of ways, except it is much more serious. There are \nwinners and losers in economic competition. The losers are consigned to \nthe British disease of long economic decline. The winners are given the \nopportunity of economic expansion and hope and better jobs and better \nwages.\n  I think soon, sooner rather than later, this country needs to decide \nto come together and develop an economic strategy that advances the \neconomic interests of all Americans in a real way. We can no longer \nmeasure consumption as a barometer of economic health. It is what we \nproduce in America that counts, because that is what creates the good \njobs. We can no longer measure GDP on a quarterly \n\n[[Page S 16455]]\n\nbasis to determine whether America is moving ahead, because it alone \ndoes not determine that. We must, and I think can, do much better.\n  Mr. President, I notice the Senator from Wyoming is waiting for the \nfloor.\n  I will yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Inhofe). The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. President, I yield to myself such time as required, \nunder the previous order of morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming is recognized.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/11/01/senate-section/article/S16451-1", "month": "11", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "01", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S16455-S16459]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        AARP AND SOCIAL SECURITY\n\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. President, I came to the floor this morning to speak \nlightly about the AARP, which I will do in a moment. But, as my \ncolleague from North Dakota is here, and I have listened to his \ncomments today, or a portion of them, and also over the past weeks \nlistened to a series of these presentations about the rich versus the \npoor, and various allusions about what sounds to me almost like class \ndistinction, class warfare, and also discussions of things like Social \nSecurity.\n  My friend, the senior Senator from North Dakota asks: Why does \nsomeone not come to the floor and speak on the issue of trade? He \nrelates that not four people will come to the floor to do that. I can \ntell you, not four people will come to the floor and tell the people \nhonestly what is happening to Social Security either. It is going \nbroke. And people here on this floor who speak a great deal will let it \ngo broke. There is not any question about what will happen to it.\n  And there is not a single argument rendered in this debate on \nreconciliation, where we are talking about Republicans taking from \nSocial Security, where the Democrats did not do exactly the same all \nthese decades. There has not been a single budget in my presence here \nthat did not do what was just done here with Social Security. It was \ndone under Carter, it was done under Reagan, it was done under Bush, \nand it is being done under Clinton. The Senator from North Dakota knows \nthat. I am on the Finance Committee. There is not a single one of us \nwho does not know that the same ``masking process,'' the same \nchicanery, the same smoke and mirrors has been pulled off by the \nDemocrats and the Republicans in my entire 17 years here. There is not \nany question about that.\n  The Senator's colleague from North Dakota is on the Finance \nCommittee, and he would also share that information with the senior \nSenator from North Dakota. Without any question, if anyone believes \nthat the Republicans are doing something different with Social Security \nthan what the Democrats have done, the same way, the same years--or the \nRepublicans--please be disabused.\n  I think we should at least remember one--everyone is entitled to \ntheir own opinion, but no one is entitled to their own facts. If Social \nSecurity is going to be used in this way, as some horrifying example of \nbeing ripped to shreds, then go read the Trustees' Report of Social \nSecurity, which was not prepared by the hobgoblins of the right or \nRonald Reagan or George Bush. It was prepared by three of the \nPresident's Cabinet: Robert Rubin, Robert Reich, Donna Shalala, with \nthe Commissioner Shirley Chater adding her dimension, and one \nRepublican and one Democrat appointed from the general public.\n  What do they tell us? They tell us that the solvency of Social \nSecurity is ``unsustainable.'' We can get another word, we can use \n``broke.'' It is unsustainable in 75 years, unsustainable in every way. \nWe know it, the Senator from North Dakota knows it, but more \nimportantly the trustees know it. If anyone wishes to have a copy of \nthat document, I will be very pleased to share it, because it shows \nthat in the year 2013 we will have to be trading in the old IOU's and \ngetting the bonds cashed, which is then a double hit on Social \nSecurity.\n  Meanwhile--and I will get to my full theme a bit later--the AARP, \nthis remarkable group of people, the American Association of Retired \nPeople, this extraordinary group of 33 million people bound together by \na common love of airline discounts and automobile discounts and \npharmacy discounts and every other discount known to man or woman, is a \ngroup of organized people who have already settled with the IRS on a \nclaim of back taxes for $135 million.\n  They asked their executive director, ``How did you pay that?'' and he \nsaid, ``We just wrote a check.'' They have $314 million in the bank, in \nT-bills. They lease a little hut down here in downtown for $17 million \na year; a 20-year lease at $17 million a year. That is your AARP, \nspeaking for ``the little guy.''\n  Where we are is--if anyone cannot understand it yet, is who we are \ngoing to hear continually about the little guy, the poor, the \ndowntrodden, the oppressed, the abused in society--and does anyone in \nAmerica know how Social Security will be restored to solvency? There \nare only two ways. You reduce the benefits or you increase the payroll \ntax. And what do you think the senior groups are continually \nrequesting? I can tell you, it is not reducing the benefits; it is \nincreasing the payroll tax.\n  And who pays the payroll tax? You got it, the little guy pays the \npayroll tax. The little guy in America is the ``stick-ee'' of this \nremarkable process regarding Social Security.\n  If you will remember, our fine colleague from New York, Senator Pat \nMoynihan, and a ``Blue Ribbon Commission,'' in the early 1980's, got \ntogether and honestly put this program ``on the table'' and got off the \ntable all the tired babble about Social Security, about the poor and \nthe wretched, the disabled and the infirm and so on--got that off the \ntable and said, ``This program is going broke, absolutely broke.'' \nSenator Moynihan and a remarkable group of Democrats and Republicans \nthen came together. That is impossible in this atmosphere. The water in \nthe well is so poisoned now on this issue, we could never address it \nagain. You are not supposed to even touch it. My mail will fill the \nroom and the phone system will bust down later in the day as I choose \nto address this remarkable issue of Social Security.\n  So you have the situation where it was going broke and the Commission \nmade some sensible recommendations. The recommendations were made in a \nvery conscientious, bipartisan manner, to reflect that, if these things \nwere carried out--and remember what one of them was; it was increasing \nof the payroll tax; but we were ready for that then--that the Social \nSecurity system would be saved until the year 2069. I hope you will \nhear that, 2069.\n  That gave everyone a remarkable sense of a job well done. Except, \nsince the early 1980's, through, now, the projections of the Social \nSecurity Administration and the trustees themselves keep moving up the \ndoomsday date.\n  And guess what the date of insolvency is now for Social Security? It \nis not the year 2069 or 2063 or 2050 or 2040. It is 2029. So since the \nearly 1980's, Social Security is still long-term unsustainable, and the \ndoomsday date--in just 13 years--has been moved from 2069 to 2029--\nmoved up 40 years. Next year it is very likely the trustees may present \nto us their report saying that it will not be sustained past the year \n2025. What a tragedy. And here we sit--all of us just sitting. We know \nit. We all know it.\n  I am going to accept the word of those three fine Democratic Cabinet \nmembers, who I respect and know--each of them individually. They are \nable Americans. I like them personally. We have our differences \npolitically. But these fine people are telling us that in the year \n2012--stretch it to 2013, if you want to--that the IOU's will be cashed \nin. Bonds will be then sold, and the American people will take a hit \nthat will take the Social Security system from the year 2013 completely \nto bankruptcy in the year 2029. Everybody knows it. There is not a soul \nthat can come into this debate and tell me that is not true. They will \nnot come to this Chamber and tell me that is not true. We all know it.\n  So we continue our process of these short-term fixes. Senator Bob \nKerrey and I, in a bipartisan effort, have presented seven bills to \nrestore solvency to the Social Security system. If you really want to \nget aboard, we are looking for cosponsors. But it is a little difficult \nto pick up cosponsors when you mention the secret sinister dual phrase \n``Social Security'' and necessity to restore its ``solvency'' because \npeople do not believe it. But Bob Kerrey and I believe it.\n\n[[Page S 16456]]\n\n  So, if we are going to be doing some positive things, why, take a \nlook at the good thoughtful bipartisan approach of Senator Bob Kerrey \nand myself and what we are doing to save the Social Security system--\nwithout any gimmickry whatsoever. We are going to phase up the \nretirement age. We are going to let people put in 2 percent of their \npayroll tax into a personal investment plan where they can call the \nshots on that themselves, 4\\1/2\\ percent would then still go to the \nSocial Security system, which will reduce the size of the benefit and \nwill also help to salvage the system.\n  If the American people understand nothing else--and the fortunate \npart of all this is that we have a year to tell them what really \nhappened in reconciliation--if we had but just a few months or weeks, \nwe would never be able to get it through the clatter, the flak, and the \ntinfoil that is being shot out over America to, I guess, divert truth. \nBut we will have that opportunity for an entire year to tell the \nAmerican people exactly what we are doing--such things as ``doing \nsomething'' with Medicare, which is going to go broke in the year 2002. \nYou have heard that. You are thinking, there he goes again, and they \nare all nuts. They are just telling us that.\n  We all know what we did in the reconciliation by allowing Medicare to \ngo up 6.4 percent per year, and so I want everyone to be absolutely \ncheered to know that Medicare will now not go broke in the year 2002. \nNo, it will go broke in the year 2009. Everybody knows that. I know it. \nThose on the other side of the aisle know it. The President knows it.\n  Think of this. This is what is happening. These numbers are correct. \nNo one can come and challenge these figures. Somebody will come in and \nsay, ``He is terribly wrong. It will not go broke until the year \n2012.'' That ought to cheer us all, too. It will not go broke in 2002. \nIt will not go broke in 2009. It will go broke in 2012. That is pretty \nshort rations in any form.\n  If we are continually trying to frighten ``the little guy,'' then \nthere is a good way to really frighten the little guy. Tell him or that \nMedicare will not just be there going up 6.4 percent each and every \nyear; it will be broke, flat busted, out of money. Tell them that. That \nwill get a reaction out of them--probably a little more startling than \nbeing told it had been cut. ``Cut schmut!'' How can you say ``cut'' \nwhen you go up 6.4 percent? That is exactly what we are doing. So if \nyou like to frighten the little guy, let us do it right.\n  Let us just get down to the political reality because we live in that \narena. Let us say that we fail to tell our story in a year. There is \nnot a question in my mind but that we will, and the American people \nknow that finally a responsible political party decided to do something \nresponsible.\n  Let us say we fail, and they take up a pitchfork on November 6, 1996, \nand just pitch us all out in the snow, which they have a way of doing \nin this country--recalling that ``Get out before they throw you out'' \nis a great phrase in our line of work.\n  Let us say they do that. And I guess the campaign then to that date \nto have done that would be a simple one. It will be that ``We saw what \nthose rascals, the ragamuffin Republicans, did to you, and we are going \nto get it all back for you. We are not going to let Medicare go up only \n6.4 percent, which is the horrible thing they did to you. No, we are \ngoing to let it go up 10 percent and 12 percent a year just like it did \nbefore. We are not going to let them get away with letting Medicaid go \nup only 4.8 percent. We are going to let it go up 9 just like it did \nbefore. We are not going to let them talk about phasing up the \nretirement age of Medicare so that it matches that same increment of \nSocial Security, which we have already done.''\n  If that all happens then any figures that I have given you from the \ntrustees or other sources--just accelerate them up 100 percent, and all \nof the systems will go broke even faster. Each and every one of them \nwill go broke faster.\n  Ladies and gentlemen, if we can also get away from the travesty of \npretending that there really is a Social Security trust fund and that \nsomehow we politicians on both sides of the aisle dabble in it and mix \naround in it with our hands as if it were something from the cauldron \nin the first act of Macbeth, as we draw it out of there and wildly \nspend it. Remember there is no Social Security trust fund. And we have \nnever ``dipped into it.'' I take it back. One time we did. But that \nlasted only about 2 days. We spanked our own hands so vigorously the \nredness is still there. We never did that again, and cannot, and will \nnot by law.\n  So, these funds are all in IOU's because the law on Social Security \nsays whenever there are surpluses in Social Security--and there are \nhuge surpluses right now, and they will become ever more magnificent. \nThey could reach $2 trillion before 2012 when the big decline, the \nfinal fall off, the ultimate drawdown, begins to take place.\n  So here we are knowing these things--all of us. All of us know it, \nand we all know, too, that the surplus cannot be used except to be \nplaced in securities of the United States of America, secured by the \nfull faith and credit of the United States. So every single penny of \nreserves of Social Security is, by law, used to purchase T-bills, \nsavings bonds, whatever, backed by the full faith and credit of the \nUnited States and purchased by your bank, and purchased by individuals \nand other nations' too. The interest on those securities is not paid \nfrom any Social Security trust fund or funds. It is paid from the \ngeneral Treasury of the United States of America. No one can come to \nthe floor and say that is not the case.\n  So, when the time comes--and it is coming soon--for when I was a \nfreshman at the University of Wyoming, there were 16 people paying into \nthe Social Security system and one person taking benefits out. Today, \nthere are three people paying into the Social Security system and one \nperson taking out, and in 20 years there will be two people paying into \nthe Social Security system and one taking out. How long do you think \nthat the younger generation then is going to sit and put up $10,500 \neach, two people, to sustain a person at $21,000 a year or $20,000 or \nsimilar amount on Social Security?\n  The saddest part of the debate in the last 3 years was that this \nPresident, President Clinton, put in his first budget--and I commend \nhim sincerely and heartily for it--an entire section called \n``intergenerational accounting.'' It was powerful stuff. It was real. \nIt was true. It talked about what is going to happen--the program is \nunsustainable, what will occur to the young people, and how it has to \nbe adjusted. Yet this time in his budget presentation there was not one \nsingle word about ``intergenerational accounting,'' not a word.\n  I find through my less-than-positive sources, since I labor in \nminority status there on Pennsylvania Avenue, that the good, thoughtful \npeople on the President's cabinet and staff wanted to include that \nstatement again, Secretary Reich, Dr. Alice Rivlin, several there--but \nthat the ``political types'' in the White House said: Do not touch that \none again. You touched it the first time and it was so true it even \nleaked down and people could understand what was going to happen to \nthose systems. But do not touch it this time.\n  So we did not touch it. He did not touch it. And then he appointed \nthis fine commission to look into these entitlements, with Bob Kerrey \nand Jack Danforth as chair and co-chair. They did a beautiful job. Read \ntheir report. I commend that to anyone. Then soon after that \nappointment we did another little statute that said we owe it to \nourselves to examine into these various programs, and somehow we left \noff the word and the entire program of ``Medicare.'' We will not \naddress the word ``Medicare.'' The word ``Medicare'' is left out, and \nthat is the one that is really eating our lunch. That is the one that \nis going to go broke, and that is the one we all know will go broke.\n  Now, if we can wade through this type of garbled activity in these \nnext days and weeks, we may be able to get there. If we can wade \nthrough it in the next year, we may be able to get there.\n  And who did this? Who visited this sinful pile of debt upon us? Well, \nlet me tell you. I hope the American people understand who did this. We \ndid this. This was not done by Ronald Reagan or Jimmy Carter or George \nBush or President Clinton. We in the Congress did this. The Presidents \nof the United \n\n[[Page S 16457]]\n\nStates get not a single vote on this. They can veto it, yes. But no \nvotes . I have watched this game for 17 years. Wire up a budget, ship \nit to the President, see if it will blow up under their chair. It is a \ngreat trick. Democrats are highly skilled at it. Republicans, it will \ntake us a little longer to learn. Put it together, roll it back and \nforth up and down Pennsylvania Avenue, and see if it will detonate \nunder whose chair. And that will not solve much for the people of \nAmerica.\n  But we did this. There is not a one of us in this Chamber, including \nyour loyal scrivener and correspondent of the moment, who did not \n``hire on'' in some way to bring home the bacon. Bring home the bacon: \nGo get the HUD program; go get this center; this building; go get the \nfarm money; go get this; go get the dam; go get that; all accompanied \nwith a press release.\n  Who do you think did it? Nobody but us. I do not have the courage I \nused to, to do the press release anymore saying, ``Senator Simpson \nannounced today more bucks for his State.'' It is a good way to get \nreelected forever, I guess. People I know who have been here have done \njust that. Bring home the bacon.\n  I would love to share with you the outlay of Federal expenditures per \ncapita to the various States of the Union, and then you might know who \nrepresents those people in this Chamber of the Senate. You would be \nvery intrigued to see who brings home the most bacon, who burdens the \ntaxpayers--burdens the taxpayers most.\n  Mr. President, $3.6 billion goes to one State with only 0.2 percent \nof the population of the United States. How about that, $3.6 billion in \nFederal outlays to a State with a population of 638,800. That is a per \ncapita spending of almost $6,000 of taxpayers' money per person. It is \nNo. 6 in the country per capita.\n  Those things need to be known, and they are not known. It is time \nthey were known if we have to get into this kind of a continual ritual \nthat somehow this is abject trickery or somehow it is ``the rich versus \nthe poor.''\n  Ladies and gentlemen, I know this is shocking, but I have a theory \nabout what we might do with the rich. Oh yes. Instead of taxing them \nmore, we might well confiscate everything they have. Just take it all. \nTake every stock certificate, every yacht, every ranch, every villa or \nhome, every trust, and just snatch it, take it. Go down through the \nForbe's 400 and the Fortune 500--I am talking about individual wealth \nnow--and just snake it off the table, every penny. And guess what? It \nwill run the country for about 7 months. Got it. It is a figure of \nabout $800 billion. Yes I am talking about the Wal-Mart money; I am \ntalking about every family in America that we look upon as ``the \nrich.'' Take it all and it will run the country for 7 months because, \nladies and gentlemen, the budget of the United States this year is \n$1.506 trillion. Got it? One year.\n  Does anyone believe that we are not ``doing something'' for \nAmericans? Can anyone believe in their heart and mind and soul that we \nare doing nothing for our country and its men and women and children \nwhen we are spending $1.506 trillion this year--1 year--1 year to run \nthe United States of America?\n  I know it is painful to go through these figures again, but it is \nvery true that 1 percent of these ``rich'' pay 27.4 percent of all \ntaxes in the United States of America. Oh I know I should not even have \nsaid it. And the top 5 percent pay 45.9 percent of all taxes in \nAmerica, and the top 10 percent pay 57.5 percent of all taxes into the \nFederal Treasury of America. The bottom 50 percent pay only 1.5 \npercent, ladies and gentlemen. Those are figures from the Census \nBureau, figures from the IRS, figures from the GAO report, and that is \nthat.\n  So when you give tax relief, which the President desperately wants to \ndo too--the President of the United States has decided that he wants to \ngive people a tax cut. We in the Republican faith have decided that we \nwant to give people a tax cut. The President of the United States has \nsaid that he would like to see Medicare go up only 7.1 percent. We are \nsaying that we would like to see it go up only 6.4 percent. So we are \nnot that far away.\n  Obviously, the President and this Republican majority are right on \ntrack with Medicare, but you would never know that. Oh, no, a serious \n``cut'' is taking place. What is it then that the President is doing? \nIs that not a cut? You either cut or you cut or you slow an increase or \nyou slow an increase. A rose is a rose is a rose. So if the 6.4 percent \nincrease of the Republicans is a cut, then the 7.1 percent increase of \nthe President is a cut, and we and the public should both use the same \nvocabulary on that. We will get there somehow. If we dull the rhetoric \nand the warfare, we will get there.\n  So I just think it is always appropriate to talk about Social \nSecurity. And when people come to the floor and say let us leave it \noff, we ought to leave off the table Social Security, well yes we all \ndid that. It was a magnificent flight from reality. How do you leave \nout of the equation something that is worth $360 billion? Social \nSecurity, ladies and gentlemen, is $360 billion a year.\n  As we scratch around for money on this floor, where we are looking \nfor something for my State or something for the State of the Senator \nfrom North Dakota, looking for only $100,000 or $2 million or $3 \nmillion, I can tell you where we could have found a ton of it. You just \nsaw a cost-of-living allowance go out to Social Security recipients \nregardless of their net worth or their income. It was $8.7 billion.\n  Mr. President, $8.7 billion went out to all of the recipients of \nSocial Security on a 2.6 percent COLA, judged by the CPI, Consumer \nPrice Index, and all of it with no means testing, no affluence testing, \nnothing, some of it going to people who have gotten all of their Social \nSecurity taxes back in the first 5 years. You know that, I know that. \nTo some people the difference is not the cost of living but the cost of \nliving it up. And we make no means test. No affluence test of any kind.\n  You have the issue of part B premiums. If we are really talking about \nthe little guy now, I want to hear much more about the little guy when \nwe talk about part B premiums because, ladies and gentlemen, part B \npremiums are totally voluntary. Part B is totally voluntary. It was \nnever part of any contract with anyone, certainly not with the seniors, \nbecause you step up, and they say, ``Do you want part B? If you do, you \nare going to pay $46.10 a month.'' And $46.10 a month is 30 percent of \nthe premium.\n  So, ladies and gentlemen, if you really want to talk about the little \nguy, then remember that the wealthiest people in America who have \nvoluntarily chosen part B coverage are paying 30 percent of the \npremium, and the people that maintain this building at night when we \nshut down the action in this ``cave of the winds,'' the people who are \nworking hard here, are paying 70 percent of the premium for the \nwealthiest people in America. Got that? Not one person can refute that. \nI want to hear from anyone on that one, if we have any rebuttal at all \non that one. There will be none. So, 70 percent of all the premiums on \npart B, which is voluntary and which is an income transfer program, are \npaid by the general taxpayers of the United States.\n  Let me conclude. I have here in my hand the most fascinating and \nintriguing mailing sent out to me by ``the mother of all mailers'' in \nthe United States. This is the AARP I speak of again. The mother of all \nnonprofit mailers. And 1.5 percent of all mail in the United States \nunder their particular permit class is by the AARP, ladies and \ngentlemen. And a larger percent of the mail men and mail women all over \nAmerica get hernias carrying their good works and telling of the \nunselfish efforts of the AARP--applications for credit cards, \ninsurance, investment advice, and even tax counseling, which is a \ndazzling array of services. I think they do need tax counseling \nbecause, you see, they settled with the IRS for $136 million that they \nhad not paid in taxes because of unrelated business income. But \nremember, they just wrote a check. That is your poor, beleaguered AARP.\n  But, anyway, they sent this. It came to the mother of one of our \ncolleagues. Of course, the AARP is, as I say, the mother of all \nnonprofit mailers. You might remember them. We sent that group $86 \nmillion in Federal--that is, taxpayers'--money last year.\n  This is also the noble group that rakes in more than $110 million--\nmillion--annually in insurance premiums and does not pay any taxes on \nthat. \n\n[[Page S 16458]]\n\n Prudential, New York Life, RV Insurance, no; remember they get 3 \npercent of every premium paid--from Prudential Life Insurance Co. And \nthis is also the group that has over $300 million in T-bills just \n``sitting around,'' lying around.\n  But one clear use they have found for all their vast money is to use \nit in what I call ``astroturf'' lobbying, which is different from \n``grassroots'' lobbying. Surely you know that. You know what astroturf \nis. It is fake grass, phony, a synthetic facsimile. And ``fakery'' is a \npretty darn appropriate word to describe the tactics that they employ \nin this piece of correspondence.\n  I honestly, for the life of me, cannot figure out how an organization \nof this size, power and clout cannot afford to hire some poor soul to \nget their facts straight. Maybe they do not care to. Perhaps deception \nis the intention. For starters, they say that the Senate ``will vote on \na proposal to cut Medicare spending by $276 billion over the next 7 \nyears.''\n  There is that word ``cut'' again. We will want to see it again when \nthey describe the President's proposal on Medicare, which is a 7.1 \npercent increase in Medicare. We will see if they use that word ``cut'' \nagain. They used it again when they say ``this level of `cuts' is \nunprecedented,'' even though they all know full well that under this \nplan Medicare will go up 6.4 percent per year, faster than any other \nmajor spending category in the budget. And, ladies and gentlemen, does \nanyone in this Chamber or in this country believe that if we are able \nto do this--and we will--that 7 years from now we will say a 6.4-\npercent increase was not enough, so we should raise it, or say 6.4 \npercent was too much, and we will now let it go up by only 2 percent a \nyear?\n  By then nobody is going to let it go up only 2 percent a year. No, we \nwill always, from now to eternity, let it go up 6.4 percent or more per \nyear because that is the figure we picked. And then tack 20 or 30 years \nonto that percentage increase and you will really see an unsustainable \nprogram, totally, totally, hideously unsustainable.\n  Here is another one for you from this AARP mailing. It is a real \nchuckler. A headline that says, ``No Medicare Coverage Until 67.'' They \nusually have a block wreath around that or extra emphasis on the ink in \nthe title. ``No Medicare Coverage Until Age 67.'' Is that not funny? \nBecause I thought the current AARP members were sucked into this \ngargantuan operation when they were 50 years old--and they are. You can \nbe a member of the AARP at the age of 50 by paying your $8 or picking \nup a copy of their magazine, usually a 4- or 5-year-old magazine, \nperhaps at the dentist's office. They include that as a membership. If \nthere are magazines laying in these places, that is a ``member,'' I \nthink, to them. So you can be 50 years old and be a member--whether \nretired or not.\n  The plan before the Senate last week would have gradually increased \nthe eligibility age to 67 over a span of 24 years, and never faster \nthan 2 months per year and, thus, not fully phased in until the year \n2027. Guess why we did that? Yet it was taken out. I hope the people of \nAmerica will realize what will happen by taking it out. We did it that \nway to match what we have already done with the Social Security \nProgram, which is already on the track for this kind of a phaseup. Hear \nthat.\n  So in this deception how old will the youngest current AARP member be \nthen in the year 2027? Well, they would be 82 years old. They will have \nbeen collecting Medicare for more than a decade by the time this \nproposed eligibility age increase was fully ``phased in.''\n  In other words, not a single person who is an intended recipient of \nthis mailing would be affected by the full impact of that, not a single \nperson. In fact, no current AARP member would see their eligibility age \npostponed by more than 1 year--more than 1 year--no current member of \nthe AARP.\n  Now, that is a real slick organization. They also say that ``only \n$110 billion'' in cuts are actually necessary to restore solvency to \nMedicare. And for how long, I might ask? And they then say to the next \ndecade. ``Through the next decade,'' they retort. Great. So up through \nthe year 2005 then, only 3 years later than the current crash date. \nWhat chicanery. What bald-faced balderdash.\n\n  Actuarial solvency is measured by the trustees over a 75-year period, \nand it is unsustainable. They know it and you know it and I know it. \nBut the good old AARP is content to let the system go belly up in 10 \nyears. It strikes me as quaintly odd that the AARP can get so agitated \nover eligibility ages that will not even be fully effective for three \ndecades and do not care a wit about Medicare solvency beyond the year \n2005. What a group.\n  Here is another intriguing one for you. They express outrage that \nunder our plan ``beneficiaries with incomes above $50,000 would pay a \nmuch higher monthly premium. How long,'' they ask, ``will it be before \nCongress lowers this to $40,000 or even $30,000,'' implying, of course, \nthat any attempt--any attempt at all--at means testing or affluence \ntesting of anything is dangerous and dastardly oppressing.\n  Oh, I wish I could tell you how many times AARP representatives have \ncome through my door, along with ``Edna the Enforcer.'' You have seen \nthat wonderful cartoon by Jim Borgman of the Cincinnati Enquirer; \n``Edna the Enforcer'' making her rounds for the AARP in the dark of \nnight. She is a husky one. She comes in, and they have a caricature of \nme in the most emaciated form, actually--most shocking! I am saying, \n``Don't pull the phone tree, Edna, not the phone tree!'' and then she \ngives you ``the word.'' Well, those are clever, and Jim Borgmann is one \nof the best. I met him many years ago. Go look at it. Its a kick. See \nit.\n  So they have come to my door, the AARP, and visited with me and my \nstaff, and they say this. Here is what they say: ``Oh, Senator, you are \nnot correct, but we do support some kind of means testing or affluence \ntesting. We would like to call it 'income relating' but not affluence \ntesting. But we agree, it's the way to go. Of course, we can't come out \ntoo far in front of it, but we understand you're on the right track.''\n  That is the word you get in your office. That's what they tell me. \nWhat their members are hearing is something quite, quite different.\n  Then ``income relating'' is the word they have now used, as they call \nit, and it is portrayed as a sinister precedent--a harbinger of evil \nthings yet to come. What a courageous outfit.\n  Then, of course, another letter has gone out from them about the CPI. \nThey are saying, ``Oh, for Heaven's sake, don't mess with the CPI.'' I \nam on the Finance Committee. Not a single person from Alan Greenspan to \nall the experts we saw said anything but that the CPI, the Consumer \nPrice Index, was ``overstated.''\n  And get the rest of this latest letter to all of us. This is supposed \nto make you cringe and certainly your staff is supposed to cringe when \nyou get this in your mailbox from the AARP dated October 23:\n\n       If Congress adjusts the CPI in the absence of the Bureau of \n     Labor Statistics findings, AARP would regard such action as \n     ``a thinly disguised effort to cut COLA's and raise taxes.''\n\n  I also know what that is. That is a thinly disguised threat.\n  Then they go on to say, which they all do, and you know what they \nsay, that the people who will be hurt the most will be ``the near poor, \nmostly single women permanently pushed into poverty,'' in addition, and \nso on and so on, not thinking that if they go broke, the poor in \npoverty will really be pushed into something grotesque.\n  So this is the kind of rubbish that I see spewed out from the AARP \nthrough Horace Deets, John Rother--and they are genial people--except \nwhen they are not, and also their full chorus and company of \napologists, paid actuaries accountants, lawyers, trustees, and \ntrustors. Their budget for staff is $60 million a year. Try digging \ndown through various entities and the foundations of the AARP. It is \nlike digging through the Pyramids of Egypt. They have the Andrus \nFoundation, this foundation, that foundation, and nobody knows the \nbucks that they have in each of the stack.\n  They have never come up with anything new, and everything they do can \nbe refuted. Just as when they said to the IRS, ``We do not owe you any \ntaxes, don't you understand,'' and then they paid 136 million bucks to \n``settle up'' and wrote a check. When they said to \n\n[[Page S 16459]]\n\nthe Postal Service, ``But we're permitted to mail our insurance \nsolicitations at nonprofit rates,'' and the Post Office said, ``No, \nyou're not,'' and they had to cough up $2.4 million to get off the hook \nthere, and that will be the eternal struggle for them and should be.\n  Remember, this is the group of worthies who clog your mailbox with \n1.5 percent of all the nonprofit mailings in their class in the United \nStates and this is evidence of the level of trust and reliability that \nthey have in this country.\n  If everyone in Congress really likes to thump their chest and say \nthat they always stand up to the special interests, well, the AARP is \nthe biggest, toughest, canniest, most powerful slugger, the most \nruthless and, I think, the most deceitful of them all.\n  So I trust my colleagues will show their true mettle and legendary \ncourage in ``standing tall'' as we all deal with this remarkable 1,800-\npound gorilla in the days and months to come.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Santorum).

Mr. President, the Senator from Wyoming is now and always \nhas been one of the most colorful presenters on the floor of the \nSenate. He has also been an excellent Senator. I occasionally find much \nto agree with him about. This morning, I found several areas in which \nwe disagree. I always find it interesting that it upsets some when you \ncome to the floor of the Senate and talk about the economic system in \nthis country and who is doing well and who is not, because the \nimplication of that, they say, is, if you point out who is doing well, \nit is class warfare.\n  I pointed out on the floor of the Senate this morning that the \naverage worker in this country, if you had a line of all Americans from \nthe richest to the poorest folks, the average person makes about \n$26,000 a year and in 15 years has lost $100 a month of income. That is \nwhat I pointed out. That is the truth.\n  I also pointed out that those in the top 1 percent in America are \ndoing very well. I do not regret that. Good for them. The incomes of \nthe top 1 percent have increased in a 16-year period by 79 percent to \nan average of $576,000 a year. I wish everyone could experience that. \nThat is my point. I wish the fruits of this economy could be available \nto everyone.\n  It is not class warfare to point out who is benefiting and who is \nnot. Our job is to try to figure out how we help those who are not.\n  The fact is, productivity in this country is going up, so the average \nworkers out there are doing their part. Corporate profits are going up. \nThe stock market is going up. But guess what? Wages are going down in \nreal terms, and we better start caring about that as a country. We \nbetter start doing something about it.\n  When someone raises the question, we better stop saying class \nwarfare. It is not constructive. Let us talk about this economy, who \nwins and who loses, who is rewarded and who is not and how do we lift \nthe middle-income families in this country and give them opportunity, \nprovide jobs with good wages.\n  What the middle-income people see is lower paychecks, lower wages, \nand their jobs being shipped overseas, all by the same people who in \nthis upper 1 percent, by the way, are getting million-dollar increases \na year in salary because they are downsizing and shipping their jobs \nout of this country. Can I provide the facts for that? You bet I can. I \ncan tell you who is doing it, when and why and how much they are being \nrewarded for moving jobs overseas.\n  Well, enough about that. But I hope we can have a discussion one day \non the floor of the Senate about this economic system and trade policy \nand what we ought to do to address these issues.\n  The Senator from Wyoming began by talking about Social Security and \nused the word ``bankrupt'' generously. The Social Security System is \nnot going bankrupt. It does no service to the American people to try to \nscare people about the Social Security System and so-called bankruptcy.\n  In the year 2029, the Social Security system will be out of money. \nThe Senator is correct about that. Between now and then, we will have \nyearly surpluses, until about the year 2013. So about 34 years from \nnow, unless we make some adjustments, we will have a problem. We will \nmake adjustments. We have in the past and will in the future. The fact \nis that our responsibility is to make adjustments.\n  The Senator from Wyoming said the Republicans are doing what has \nalways been done--that is, using the Social Security surpluses as part \nof the revenue of the operating budget. The best I can say is that the \nSenator says this is business as usual. I guess it is. I thought this \nwas about reform and change. The Senator says this is business as \nusual. It has always been done, so we are going to keep doing it.\n  In 1983, I say to the Senator from Wyoming, I was on the Ways and \nMeans Committee. I voted on and worked on that Social Security reform \npackage. If the Senator will go back to the markup form, I offered an \namendment that day. It was on the same thing I speak about today--that \nis, you should not collect payroll taxes, which are, by nature, \nregressive, promise people it is going to go into a trust fund and then \npull it over into the operating budget and use it. That is dishonest, \nand I said that 12 years ago; dishonest, I say again on the floor of \nthe Senate today. Am I a Johnny-come-lately on this issue? You better \nbelieve I am not. I have talked about this for 12 years.\n  This is dishonest budgeting. It was by Democrats, and it is by \nRepublicans. It is dishonest and it ought to stop. The Senator said we \nhave always done these things. But nobody ever did what was done last \nFriday. I hope, and will wait today for somebody to put in the Record \nwhat was done late Friday night, taking $12 billion out of the Social \nSecurity accounts in the reconciliation bill in order to fund other \nparts of the bill. It has never been done. It is a violation of the \nlaw, and the only reason it was done was because of the language we \nused, ``notwithstanding any other provision of law.''\n  I challenge anybody on the floor of the Senate today to come \ndemonstrate that this has been done before. It has never been done \nbefore. It should not have been done on Friday, and it represents phony \nbudgeting. Everybody in this Chamber knows it. So when people say, we \nare just doing what has always been done--not true. Not true.\n  There is plenty to talk about on Medicare and Social Security. I \nhappen to think both of these programs have advanced this country's \ninterests. Both programs need adjustments. There is no question about \nthat. I am willing to work with the Senator from Wyoming, and others, \nin sensible ways to think through in the long-term what we do about \nthese issues. But I do not think it is wrong or unreasonable for us to \nask questions about the priorities of cutting $270 billion from what is \nneeded in Medicare in the next 7 years and then deciding to cut taxes, \nespecially after we say to you, well, at least limit the tax cut to \nthose below a quarter-million dollars a year and back off on the \nadjustments you intend to make for some of the poorest of the poor, who \nrely on Medicaid and Medicare. If we are told we cannot do that because \nthat is not our priority, then we understand we have very different \npriorities.\n  I am not alleging that you all do not care about Social Security or \nMedicare. I think there are some who do not. I think there are some who \nnever believed in it, who never wanted it and, even today, if given a \nchance, would vote, probably in secret, to get rid of both. The fact \nis, I happen to think \n\n[[Page S 16460]]\n\nboth have advanced this country's interests and helped us to be a \nbetter country. I think when we, as Democrats and Republicans, are \nrequired to make adjustments in these programs, we would be well to \nmake adjustments without putting them in a vehicle where we have \ndecided, also, before we balance the budget, to provide a significant \ntax cut. I understand there is even reason to disagree on the tax cut. \nI think working families deserve a lower tax burden. I would like to \nsee us do the first job first: Balance the budget, and decide after we \nhave done that job how we change the Tax Code and provide relief for \nworking families.\n  Mr. THOMAS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I think the time until 12 o'clock is set \naside for discussion on this side of the aisle, to talk a little bit \nabout what we have been doing over the last couple weeks, to talk about \nsome of the heavy lifting going on--balancing the budget, strengthening \nMedicare, reforming welfare, and doing something to reduce the tax \nburden on middle-class Americans. We want to talk a little about moving \nto the negotiation table, so that what is being done here can be done \nto affect the American public.\n  I yield 10 minutes to the Senator from Georgia.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/11/01/senate-section/article/S16459-1", "month": "11", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "01", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S16460-S16461]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          PROTECTING MEDICARE\n\n  Mr. COVERDELL. I thank my colleague from Wyoming. I, of course, take \nsome issue with the Senator from North Dakota. He quoted the \nstatistics--to digress a moment--that indicated that Social Security \nwas solvent until 2029, or something like that. The same people that he \nis quoting have told him, also, that Medicare is bankrupt in 6 years. \nThey seem to forget that. Those trustees are really credible when they \ntalk about Social Security, but they are not credible when they talk \nabout Medicare.\n  Those same people that he is quoting are the ones that are telling \nthe other side of the aisle that we better get serious about doing \nsomething about Medicare. The proposal that we voted on the other night \nshould make everybody who is a beneficiary, or potential beneficiary, \nvery comfortable, because that proposal guarantees a quarter-century of \nsolvency. It takes it out just like Social Security. The proposal that \nwe got from the other side of the aisle gives us a Band-Aid that would \ngive us 24 additional months. I do not think there is a senior citizen \nin this country that is comforted by somebody making--I think he \nreferred to it as ``adjustments,'' that give you 24 months of survival.\n  I think one of the strongest things that we have done is to \neffectively modify this program so that it is intact, it is secure, and \nthere are more choices, and it is solvent for a quarter-century.\n  He also stated--reluctantly, I would say, after badgering the idea \nthat we brought forward--that taxes ought to be lowered on the working \nfamilies of America. He reluctantly, at the end, indicated that, well, \nmaybe that is all right.\n  Let me tell you, it is more than all right. The other day on the \nfloor, I mentioned that when Ozzie and Harriet were the quintessential \nfamily in America, Ozzie sent 2 cents of every dollar he earned to \nWashington. Today, that average family sends 24 cents out of every \ndollar to Washington, so that we can set the priorities for those \nfamilies.\n  We have marginalized middle America. The Senator from North Dakota \nreferred to the 1 percent that are wealthy. I might say that you could \ntake this 1 percent and the 15 percent that are poor and on Government \nprograms, and they are not terribly affected by this policy. They are \neither so wealthy that it does not matter to them, or they are in the \nGovernment program. But it is the vast middle class that bears the \nburden of what has been happening in Washington for the last 25 years. \nMore and more has been extracted from that family and, as a result, \nthey are less and less able to care for the housing and the education \nand health of that family. We have all acknowledged that the family is \nthe core unit for maintaining the health of the country. But the \nGovernment has been pounding and pounding on that family for a quarter-\ncentury.\n  Today, half of their wages are consumed by one Government or \nanother--a quarter in Washington, and the other quarter is divided \nbetween State and local government. An average family today earns \n$40,000 a year. I guess that is supposed to be rich, if you listen to \nthe other side of the aisle.\n  Mr. President, $40,000--and by the end of the day they have somewhere \nbetween $20,000 and $25,000 to take care of all the needs of that \naverage family.\n  If what was passed here this past Friday finally becomes law, we \nshould talk about what that means, Mr. President, to this average \nfamily. It means that their interest payments on their mortgage is \ngoing to drop, and if that average mortgage is $50,000, they will save \n$1,081 a year in interest payments on their mortgage. They are going to \nsave $180 a year on the interest payments on their car. They are going \nto save $220 a year in interest payments on auxiliary loans, whether it \nis for a student loan or refurbishing of their home. That comes up to \nalmost $1,500 or $1,600 a year net on their kitchen table.\n  On top of that, that average family has two children. They are going \nto get a $500 credit for each child; $1,000, Mr. President, on the \nkitchen table.\n  So we have put $2,000 to $3,000 back in the account of every average \nfamily in America. That is an increase of anywhere from 10 to 20 \npercent of their disposable income. Tell me when middle America would \nhave received either in salary increases or any other benefit of that \nsignificance, 10 to 20 percent more disposable income.\n  The people that have been paying these bills, that have been paying \nthe bills for Medicare and for Medicaid and for Federal retirement and \nthe interest on our debt deserve relief, they deserve it, because we \ndepend on them to educate, to house, clothe and keep healthy the future \nof America. That is what these proposals do--they return resources to \nthe average working family in America.\n  Now, Mr. President, just an hour ago there was a joint session of the \npolicy committees on the House side and we heard from major economists \non Wall Street about these budget proposals. It was amazing. To the \nperson they said, ``Stick to it. America has got to have balanced \nbudgets.''\n  If we achieve these balanced budgets, everybody will prosper, \ninterest rates will drop. They already give us credit, this new \nCongress, from lowering it from 8 percent to 6 percent. They say if we \nactually pass this, and only 3 out of 10 Americans think we have the \nguts to do it, it will drop another percentage point. Interest rates \nwill drop, inflation will drop, and the economy will expand. This \nfamily will put $2,000 more into its own welfare and the people in that \nfamily that are looking for a new job will be standing in shorter lines \nand there will be fewer pink slips.\n  The fact that America would seize control of its destiny and manage \nits financial affairs, as any family in business has to do, will be a \nboon to America. Every one of these people said to us, ``Don't blink, \ndon't retreat. Get this done and the real beneficiaries are middle \nAmerica.''\n  They passed out this chart, Mr. President. It is hard to see, but it \nshows the relationship to the growth in spending to inflation. When we \nare irresponsible as caretakers of our financial affairs in the \nCongress, and we spend too much--more than we have--we cause inflation \nto go up, we cause interest rates to go up, and then there is less \navailable for expansion, and we cause people to lose their jobs.\n  Given what we are looking at, it is mindboggling to me that the other \nside of the aisle is not right at the table trying to find a way to \nsupport change in the way Washington has been operating.\n  Mr. President, we have been told that unless the United States does \nsomething very quickly, that within 10 years all U.S. revenues, all of \nour wealth, will be consumed by five things: Social Security, Medicare, \nMedicaid, Federal retirement, and the interest on our debt. And nothing \nis left.\n  That was presented to a group the other day in my home State and a \nwoman stood up and said, ``How in the world would we defend \nourselves?'' Good question. We could not. World rogues would love it if \nwe stumbled \n\n[[Page S 16461]]\n\ninto the next century, crippled financially and unable to maintain the \nstatus of the superpower that we are. Five expenditures, and it is all \ngone.\n  Last April the trustees of Medicare came forward and said, ``Look, it \nis bankrupt. Congress and Mr. President, do something about it.''\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I yield 10 minutes to the Senator from \nMinnesota.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/11/01/senate-section/article/S16460-1", "month": "11", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "01", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S16461-S16462]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     THE $500-PER-CHILD TAX CREDIT\n\n  Mr. GRAMS. I want to thank Senator Thomas, my good friend from \nWyoming, for setting aside this time on the floor today for my freshmen \ncolleagues and I to share our perspective on the Second American \nRevolution.\n  There may be 11 freshmen new to the Senate this year, but we speak \nwith a single voice when we talk about the mandate handed to us by the \nvoters last November.\n  Beginning last Wednesday morning and continuing for 20 hours, this \nSenate undertook a historic debate. For 20 hours, as we outlined the \nBalanced Budget Reconciliation Act, we had the opportunity to outline \nfor the American people a new vision for this country.\n  Our vision is about standing up for taxpayers and their families. It \nis about reining in the big government that has inserted itself more \nand more deeply into their lives over the last 40 years.\n  Our vision--this new approach to governing--begins with balancing the \nbudget, preserving Medicare, redefining welfare, and letting the people \nkeep more of their own money, through our $245 billion package of tax \nrelief.\n  Forty years of backroom wheeling and dealing by my colleagues across \nthe aisle have dealt the American people nothing but a string of losing \nhands.\n  The big spenders may have had a long run, but they never played by \nthe rules. Instead of using their own money, they demanded--over and \nover again--that the taxpayers be the ones to ante up.\n  With this Congress, however, it is a whole different game.\n  We are no longer going to let the Government gamble away the \ntaxpayers' hard-earned dollars. In fact, we are going to keep those \ndollars out of the Government's hands in the first place.\n  As you know, the centerpiece of our tax relief package is the $500-\nper-child tax credit, and I am proud that my colleagues stood with me \nto ensure that this desperately needed provision remains at the heart \nof our reconciliation bill.\n  The $500-per-child tax credit will return $23 billion nationwide \nevery year to working-class families, and those families have been \nvocal in sharing their thoughts on what kind of difference the child \ntax credit would make in their lives.\n  Since I began working on the $500-per-child tax credit 3 years ago, \nas a Member of the U.S. House, I have been receiving letters urging \nCongress to follow through on our promise of middle-class tax relief.\n  The letters have come from Minnesotans and from concerned Americans \nacross this country, as well.\n  I hope they do not mind if I share parts of their letters with my \ncolleagues.\n  Just a few: From Alabama, where the $500-per-child tax credit would \nreturn $354 million annually, I received this note on the very same day \nwe began debating the reconciliation legislation.\n  The letter said:\n\n       Please continue your work toward Medicare reform, a \n     balanced budget over 7 years, and tax cuts. The people of \n     this country are with you and waiting for this to happen.\n\n  From California, where the $500-per-child tax credit would return \n$2.6 billion annually:\n\n       Our families desperately need tax relief, and our \n     government needs to stop spending so wastefully.\n\n  Another letter, signed a ``California Democrat,'' read in part:\n\n       Thank you for your support of the family tax credit. As a \n     parent of three, I know parents need the help.\n\n  From Florida, where the $500-per-child tax credit would return $973 \nmillion annually:\n\n       Thanks for your efforts this past year in supporting tax \n     relief for families!\n\n  From Georgia, where the $500-per-child tax credit would return $570 \nmillion annually:\n\n       I am writing to thank you for proposing the budget plan \n     that would cut federal spending more than President \n     Clinton's, and for supporting tax relief for families. We can \n     use all the help we get!\n\n  From Illinois, where the $500-per-child tax credit would return $1.1 \nbillion every year:\n\n       We are a one-paycheck family struggling to keep our heads \n     above water. Two of our children are in a private school. The \n     burden of paying for the public and private systems is great \n     for us.\n       Nonetheless, we must do what we know to be best for our \n     children. It is encouraging to know there are members of the \n     government who understand our struggle and are working on our \n     behalf.\n\n  From Minnesota's neighbor to the south, Iowa, where the $500-per-\nchild tax credit would return $326 million annually:\n\n       Thank you for supporting tax relief for families. Keep up \n     the great job!\n\n  From Kentucky, where the $500-per-child tax credit would return $300 \nmillion annually:\n\n       We realize you are fighting a tough battle and we fully \n     support you on this issue. Keep fighting!\n\n  From Michigan, home State of Senator Spencer Abraham, who has been \none of the Senate's most vocal advocates on behalf of family tax \nrelief, and where the $500-per-child tax credit would return $977 \nmillion annually:\n\n       I want to commend and thank you for remembering and \n     supporting the needs of families at tax time. Specifically, I \n     want to thank you for spending the past year arguing for the \n     $500 per-child tax credit.\n       There aren't very many people in Washington who remember \n     the pro-family community in our country--and even fewer \n     people in Washington who will support the family.\n\n  From Montana, where the $500-per-child tax credit would return $46 \nmillion annually:\n\n       We just wanted to take the time to say thank you for \n     supporting tax relief for families. We appreciate your stand \n     for us parents.\n\n  From Nevada, where the $500-per-child tax credit would return $95 \nmillion annually:\n\n       Tax relief is really needed. We know--we have four \n     children, one income.\n\n  From New Hampshire, where the $500-per-child tax credit would return \n$102 million annually:\n\n       My reason for this letter is to thank each of you for \n     supporting tax relief for families and to ask you to continue \n     to do so until the tax relief becomes reality.\n\n  From New York, where the $500-per-child tax credit would return $1.4 \nbillion annually:\n\n       Thanks for your work to try to get President Clinton to \n     make good on his promise to give tax relief to families.\n\n  From Oklahoma, where the $500-per-child tax credit would return $269 \nmillion annually:\n\n       As a concerned citizen, a voter, and a taxpayer, I want to \n     let you know there are a lot of us middle-income, family-\n     heads-of-households who support you firmly.\n\n  For the Presiding Officer in the chair, the Senator from \nPennsylvania, where the $500-per-child tax credit would return $1 \nbillion annually:\n\n       Please continue to keep the profamily community in mind. \n     The family network, its strength, is what keeps this Nation \n     strong.\n\n  From South Carolina, where the $500-per-child tax credit would return \n$320 million annually:\n\n       Thank you for supporting tax relief for families. Keep up \n     the good work!\n\n  From Tennessee, where the $500-per-child tax credit would return $446 \nmillion annually:\n\n       Thank you for supporting tax relief for families. Also, \n     please continue to work for the deficit and keep it a point \n     of public awareness.\n\n  From Texas, where the $500-per-child credit would return $1.6 billion \nannually:\n\n       I am in favor of a tax cut for families.\n       I believe that is one reason many people do not have more \n     children these days--the Government taxes us so much, and \n     tries to tell us how we should live and raise our children. I \n     have three children of my own.\n\n  From Washington State, where the $500-per-child tax credit would \nreturn $537 million annually:\n\n       Thank you for your work this term to get tax relief for \n     families. It is such a hard fight.\n\n  From Wisconsin, Minnesota's neighbor to the east, where the $500-per-\nchild tax credit would return $505 million annually:\n\n       Thanks for your efforts to give families tax cuts.\n\n  And finally, Mr. President, the letters have poured in from my home \n\n[[Page S 16462]]\n\nState of Minnesota, where the $500-per-child tax credit would return \n$477 million annually, completely eliminating the tax liability for \nnearly 46,000 Minnesotans: This letter came from Northfield, MN:\n\n       I'm encouraging you to support passage of a $500 per-child \n     tax credit that goes to all tax-paying families with children \n     under 18. Let's start strengthening society by supporting the \n     backbone of the society--families!\n  Then there is this letter from a family in Roseville, MN:\n\n       A $500 Federal tax credit for each dependent is not a \n     Federal hand-out, but would allow parents to keep more of the \n     money that they make, and to use it to care for their own \n     children.\n       A $500 Federal tax credit for each dependent would \n     unquestionably strengthen many families--especially middle-\n     class and economically-disadvantaged families.\n\n  And finally, a family in Minnetrista, MN, took the time to share \nthese insights with me:\n\n       As the mother of seven children with one income, I am \n     especially interested in the $500 per child tax credit. We \n     refuse to accept aid from Federal or State programs that we \n     qualify for.\n       We believe this country was built with hard work and \n     sacrifice, not sympathy and handouts. We also believe that we \n     can spend this money more effectively than the Government, \n     who has only succeeded in creating a permanent, dependent \n     welfare class with our money over the last 40 years.\n       Let's get back to basics.\n\n  Getting back to basics is what our budget plan is all about, Mr. \nPresident. That is why we are balancing the budget, protecting Medicare \nfor the next generation, fixing a broken welfare system.\n  That is why we are cutting taxes, too. And if these letters are any \nindication, the American people are solidly behind our back-to-basics \napproach.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I thank my friend from Minnesota. Those of \nus on this side of the aisle are excited about the opportunities that \nare here. We are excited that we have worked for 8 or 9 months now \ntoward this time, toward the time to have actually passed the kinds of \nchanges that we bring with us from the election last year. These are \nthe freshmen and sophomores. These are the Senators who are relatively \nnew to this body and are really wound up about what we are able to do \nhere and want to keep moving. So I am delighted they are here.\n  I yield now 10 minutes to the Senator from Tennessee.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/11/01/senate-section/article/S16461-1", "month": "11", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "01", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S16462-S16463]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          BALANCING THE BUDGET\n\n  Mr. THOMPSON. Mr. President, first of all I commend the Senator from \nMinnesota for his excellent presentation. After listening to those who \nare always for higher taxes and will use any means to fight any kind of \ntax cut on the basis that it is just a giveaway to the rich, it is \nrefreshing to hear actually what this tax cut would do, the $500-per-\nchild tax cut the Senator from Minnesota has fought so long and so hard \nfor. The letters coming from people who work hard, pay their taxes, \nraise their kids and obey the law, and find it tougher and tougher to \nget by--that is obviously who this tax credit will go to benefit. It \nbelies the accusations on the other side that, of course, this is just \na tax cut for those who do not need it.\n  Our friends on the other side of the aisle have made a profession of \ntrying to decide who in America deserves to keep more of the money they \nare earning and who deserves to have it sent to Washington for those \nenlightened Members of this body to spend for them.\n  So I think we are making substantial progress when we are obviously \ngetting our message across to the American people as to exactly what \nthis tax cut is all about. It goes to help those people who everybody \nin this body says they are concerned about. We are hearing all this \nrhetoric about the rich, the rich, the rich, and how everybody is for \nthe working person and the working family. If everybody was for the \nworking family and everybody is concentrating on doing something for \nthe working family, why is it the working family feels they are getting \nworse and worse off every year? As I said, those people who work hard, \nraise their kids and pay their taxes--this, finally, will do something \nto reach the people that everybody says they are trying to reach in \nthis country. This will actually serve that purpose.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. THOMPSON. I will be happy to yield.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Just for 30 seconds.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I commend the Senator from Wyoming, \nSenator Thomas, and all those who are helping him. I think it is \nimperative that we respond when the other side comes to the floor \nmaking statements that are half truths and irresponsible. I commend him \nfor it. I hope he does it every time they come to the floor. Across \nthis land, the real facts of what we are trying to do are getting lost \nin the plethora of facts that are coming out that have very little to \ndo with what we have done.\n  I hope the Senator does one on Medicare. Just put a chart here and \nshow what we did, so the American public will see it. We know when the \npeople see what we have done they favor what we are doing. It is when \nthey are told things we are doing that we are not doing that they begin \nto wonder about this balanced budget.\n  So I commend my colleague for it, and those who are helping him, very \nmuch. I am hopeful they will continue to do it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. Mr. President, I commend the Senator from New Mexico \nwho has been a leader with regard to responsible budgeting in this \ncountry. It is always easier to give somebody something. It is always \neasier to maintain the status quo and to tell people they can continue \non indefinitely the way we have been going and hold yourself up to \naccusations of hurting those in need, of not caring for the elderly.\n  Some Member on the other side of the aisle said, apparently, the only \nelderly that you know live in Beverly Hills. Those kinds of tactics are \ndesigned to scare people and appeal to the greedy side of people's \nnature, the implication being that as long as we can get ours today we \ndo not care about our children, and we certainly do not care about our \ngrandchildren.\n  We heard the statement earlier, ``Social Security is not in trouble. \nSocial Security is not going bankrupt. Of course, in about 30 years it \nis going to run out of money.'' But the implication is, we do not have \nto worry about that because most of us will have gotten ours by then.\n  I am concerned, not only about today and my own mother who is \ndependent on it, I am concerned about my children and my grandchildren, \nas we all should be. That is what we are talking about here. That is \nthe difference, I think, in the debate nowadays from what it has been \nin times past. That is the reason that many of us ran for political \noffice for the first time in our lives, because people are sick and \ntired and fed up with business as usual. We see the results of it. We \nsee in many respects our country is going downhill.\n  So we passed a reconciliation package to do something about that. \nPeople said they wanted a balanced budget. We are on our way to a \nbalanced budget, to save Medicare--not to destroy it, but to increase \nspending for Medicare, but at a reduced rate of growth; to change a \nfailed welfare system from something that was supposed to do good for \npeople that has changed into something that has done an immeasurable \ndisservice to many, many people in this country; to give more back to \npeople who are earning hard-earned dollars to keep in their pockets.\n  The President, I thought, pretty much agreed with those concepts. We \nhave come a long way, because some time ago the advisers to the \nPresident were saying we really did not need a balanced budget; and \nthen, yes, maybe we need one but in 10 years; then, yes, maybe we need \none and then OK, maybe 7 years.\n  The President pledged to reform welfare as we knew it back during the \ncampaign. He acknowledged that Medicare was going bankrupt, and that we \nhad to do something about it. He has proposed increasing Medicare \nspending by 7.1 percent a year. We have proposed increasing spending by \n6.4 percent a year. It seems pretty close to me. It looks to me like we \nare fairly close together, at least on some of these basic concepts. \nAnd, yet, what does the \n\n[[Page S 16463]]\n\nPresident do when we passed the reconciliation package? He says he will \nveto it, and basically he is not willing to negotiate--that we are \ndestroying Medicare: that his 7.1 percent is a responsible percentage \nof growth but our 6.4 percent would destroy Medicare. These are scare \ntactics, even though we are spending twice the rate of inflation under \nour proposal; appeals to greed; appeals to grandparents. And there is \nthe implication that, if you are making $100,000 a year, or if you are \nretired, you do not have to make any kind of incremental adjustment, we \ncan continue on not only just increasing spending, which we are all \nsaying that we will do, but increase spending at the rate that we are \nincreasing now or closer to it.\n  So people must be confused as to what the President's position is. Is \nhe for a balanced budget? Is he for changing welfare as we know it? Is \nhe for doing something about Medicare, or not? He says he is. Yet, he \nseems to not be willing to even sit down at the table to work out these \ndifferences that some might interpret as being not all that great, that \nwe might be able to work out.\n  I think the answer is clear that we are in the era now of political \nposturing, that the President feels he must come into this process \nfeeling strong, feeling tough--and that is OK--delivering the message, \nand posturing himself. That is OK. A deal will be worked out of some \nkind, and, if it is not, that will be up to the President. But I think \nprobably even more important than this particular resolution is that we \nwill get by somehow. Even more important than that is the question of \nwhether or not we have a commitment to these basic things. We can argue \nand fight over the details. That is why we have two branches of \nGovernment. That is why we have separation of powers, and checks and \nbalances in this country. That is fine.\n  But the real question we have to face up to is whether or not we as a \npeople, as a Congress, and a President are committed to the underlying \npropositions, for example, of a balanced budget because, if we are not, \nwe are going through all of this for nothing. We are going to have to \ndo so much more for so long. If we cannot pass this first hurdle, we \nwill never make it past the others because we are making the initial \ndownpayment on the balanced budget. We are going to have to own up to \nour responsibilities year after year after year. If we cannot solve \nthese problems that merely have to do with numbers, how are we going to \naddress the other major problems that are facing our country--with the \nproblems of the world economy where wages are stagnating, especially \namong our younger people; the problems of the inner city where we see \nyouth violence skyrocketing, youth drug use skyrocketing, illegitimacy \nskyrocketing; all of these social problems. If we cannot solve these \nnumbers problems, how in the world are we going to address those? How \nare we going to address the underlying problem, probably that \novershadows the rest of them? And, that is the cynicism that some of \nthe American people have in this country toward their own Government, \ntoward their own Government's ability to get things done.\n  Those are the underlying questions. Those are the more serious ones. \nI think that we can make a statement to the American people as we have \ntried to do in Congress by taking the tough votes, taking the tough \nmeasures, saying we cannot have everything exactly the way we have \nalways had it, and we are going to speak the plain truth. We can tell \nthe American people that we can do this, and because we did do this we \ncan address these other problems that lie down the road before us.\n  So I urge the President, if he is serious about balancing the budget, \nchanging welfare as we know it, saving Medicare, if he is serious about \nthe statement that he made that he raised taxes too much, if he is \nserious about the position that, yes, we should have a tax cut, then I \nwould urge him to sit down at the table and let us talk about those \ndetails. Because I think the message that I would like to deliver--and \nthere are a lot of the new Members here who would like to deliver it, \nalong with some of the maybe not-so-new Members--is that regardless of \nwhat the policies that have been around here in times past, things are \ndifferent now, and we are not going to continue to roll over these \nproblems to the next generation.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, thank you.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/11/01/senate-section/article/S16462-1", "month": "11", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "01", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S16463-S16464]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        THE REPUBLICAN TAX PLAN\n\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I appreciate hearing from my friend, \nSenator Thompson from Tennessee, who differentiates between the new \nMembers and the not-so-new Members. And I do not know in which category \nI fall. But I am pleased to be on the same side of this issue because I \nthink some of the new Members are standing up and trying to talk the \nway people are talking back home.\n  I was really struck the other day when I was listening to C-SPAN in \none of the call-in programs, and a woman called in with a very simple \nquestion. She said, ``My husband and I are working two jobs, and we \nmake $25,000 a year. How is this going to help us?'' I think what \nAmericans are saying is that it is the way Americans are talking. They \nare saying it is a legitimate question, simple and to the point. And we \ncan answer her question, and we can give her a good answer.\n  What happens to her? Under the new budget, a single mother with one \nchild working two jobs making $15,000 a year will have more money to \nfeed her family and make ends meet. Instead of an EITC check of $864, \nwhich is what she would get this year, next year under the Republican \nplan she will get a check for $1,425. If she has two children, that \nwill go up to $2,488. So she is not going to pay taxes at all. It is \ngoing to be how much she gets as an incentive for doing what she is \ndoing, and that is working two jobs instead of being on welfare. She is \ngoing to have the incentive of getting a check back from the \nGovernment, and not paying taxes, if she is a working mother with one \nor two children.\n  What about the married couple? This is the woman who called into C-\nSPAN the other day. For this year, a married couple with two children \nand an income of $25,000 will pay $929 in income tax. That is this \nyear. With the new Republican budget, next year that couple will not \npay taxes at all. Instead, they will get an EITC check of $171.\n  So we are going to eliminate taxes on 3.5 million families that would \npay taxes today, that will pay taxes for 1995--3.5 million families in \nAmerica that are paying taxes this year under our plan will not pay \ntaxes at all next year.\n  That is what it means in real terms. This is what we are trying to \ndo.\n  In 1974, families spent 33 percent of their income on the necessities \nof housing, health care, and utilities. In 1995, that is 46 percent of \na person's income, a family's income. We have heard people talking on \nthe floor about what the real income is. People are making more. But \nthey do not feel like their quality of life is as good. They do not \nfeel like they are able to buy as much for their families, or go out to \neat once a week anymore, or go to a movie once a week like they used to \nbe able to do. Yet, they are earning more. What is wrong? That is what \nis wrong. Instead of 33 percent of their income going to necessities, \nit is 46 percent. That does not count clothes or food.\n  So what we are trying to do is put the money back into the pockets of \nour families, and we are putting money into the pockets of our working \npoor.\n  Let us talk for a minute about the marriage penalty. Right now in our \ncountry, unfortunately, we have a marriage penalty. We should be \nencouraging young couples to get married. But, instead, we discourage \nthem with a marriage penalty.\n  I heard someone on the floor say, ``Oh, if we can do away with the \nmarriage penalty, it will cost the Treasury $25 billion.'' Well, the \nWall Street Journal, I think, puts it in perspective. They said wait a \nminute. To do away with the marriage penalty will save the taxpayers of \nAmerica $25 billion.\n  This is money that belongs to the person who worked for it. It does \nnot belong to the Treasury. It belongs to the person who worked for it.\n  Now, everyone in our country is here because we want to pay our fair \nshare. \n\n[[Page S 16464]]\n\n We want to participate in paying taxes for the things that we cannot \ndo ourselves. Everybody has that attitude. It is when the taxes \nencroach so much on the quality of life and when the family does not \nreally see what that does for them that we start getting people saying, \n``Wait a minute. I am paying 39 percent; I am paying 27 percent; I am \npaying 15 percent,'' whatever it is, ``and I do not see the results. \nAnd I don't feel that my taxpayer dollars are being spent wisely.'' \nThat is when people step up and say, ``Let's put this in perspective.'' \nAnd that is what we are trying to do.\n  Under the Republican plan, we increase the standard deduction for \nmarried couples that are filing jointly. By the year 2005, the marriage \npenalty will be eliminated for couples that do not itemize their \ndeductions. That is the right approach. That is encouraging families.\n  Also encouraging families is homemaker IRA's. This is something that \nI and other women Members on both sides of the aisle have been very \nactive in pursuing, and that is because we are saying we value the \nAmerican family unit. The family unit is the core of our society. And \nyet, if you are a homemaker working inside the home, doing your part to \nstrengthen society, you cannot set aside $2,000 a year in an IRA for \nyour retirement security. If you work outside the home, you can. But if \nyou work inside the home, you cannot.\n  We are going to change that with the budget reconciliation package \nthat has passed both Houses of this Congress. We are saying the \nhomemaker makes a contribution to the strength of our country that is \nevery bit as important, if not more so, than the contribution made by \npeople who work outside the home.\n  So we are going to correct an inequity that has been in our system. \nThat helps the one-income working family. Many people sacrifice for the \nhomemaker to stay home with the children. And when they sacrifice, they \nalso are going to have to make a sacrifice for retirement security, and \nI think that is wrong and so did a majority of both Houses of Congress.\n  Then there is the homemaker who becomes displaced after 25 years of \nmarriage; she becomes divorced or she loses her husband. She, too, is \ndiscriminated against in retirement security because she does not have \nthat nest egg to build up for her retirement, which she is entitled to. \nThis is in the bill that has passed both Houses.\n  We also add to other investment savings opportunities. America has \none of the lowest savings rates of any industrialized country of the \nworld. Why is that? One reason is we tax it twice. We tax savings when \nyou earn it, and we tax it while it is in a savings account. It is \ntaxed twice. Most industrialized countries do not do that.\n  We are going to provide more savings alternatives in this bill so \npeople can put money into an account and the savings will mount tax \nfree, so that when they need it, when their income levels are such that \nthey need it, they are going to be able to pull it out tax free. Or, if \nthey do not wait until retirement because they have an emergency need \nsuch as education for children, or first home or health care emergency, \nthat is going to be provided for as well.\n  So it gives people an incentive to save because they know they can \ndraw it out for an emergency and yet they are going to be able to earn \nmoney tax free either for their retirement security or for their \nemergency needs. This is going to be a savings incentive bill that is \nalso, besides helping the family that is trying to take care of its \nretirement needs or emergency needs, going to spur economic activity \nwhich creates new jobs for people coming into our system.\n  So this is a new approach. That is for sure. And many times when you \nhave something new, people are scared. They do not know what to expect, \nand so they wonder: what is all of this new action going to produce? We \nare trying to have some simple and basic themes. We are trying to help \nto encourage the American family. We are trying to encourage the \nworking families that are having a hard time making ends meet but they \nare not on welfare. They are working to make ends meet, and we are \nencouraging them by taking more of them, 3.5 million more of them off \nthe tax rolls completely. We are going to do away with the marriage \npenalty. We are going to try to spur investment to create new jobs in \nthis country. It is very simple. We are trying to save Medicare for our \ncitizens that are on Medicare now as well as for the future.\n  The Medicare trust fund is going broke. The President's own Cabinet \npeople say it is going broke. Our plan is going to save it--not by \ncutting it but by slowing the rate of growth from 10 percent per year \nto 6.4 percent per year. Even 6.4 percent per year growth is more than \nwe have in the private sector health care industry now. That is why we \nthink it is reasonable. We are going to save the system. But we are \ngoing to do it over a 7-year period so that we can grow gradually \nrather than having a meat-ax approach. We are doing the responsible \nthing for this country. We are also keeping a promise. We are doing \nwhat we said we would do. We told the people in the 1994 election: Here \nis what you can expect if you vote for me. The people did vote for us, \nand now we are giving them what they expected and what they asked for.\n  Did we make a few mistakes? Probably. Do I agree with everything in \nthe bill? No. Probably no one on this floor does either. But we can \nafford to come back again and correct mistakes that we might have made. \nWhat we cannot afford to do is nothing. That is the only mistake that \nwe cannot afford to make. We cannot afford not to fix the Medicare \nproblem. We cannot afford not to balance this budget. And we cannot \nrefuse to keep the promises that we made--for tax cuts, for encouraging \nthe American family, for encouraging the working families of our \ncountry. It is going to help the working people of our country and the \nelderly as we save the Medicare system.\n  I thank the Chair. I thank him for his leadership, and the Senator \nfrom Wyoming and others who are speaking to try to set the record \nstraight. It is scary. There is no question that people not knowing \nwhat to expect are afraid. We have to let people know exactly what we \nare doing and hope that their common sense makes them understand that \nthis is going to be good in the long term for our children and \ngrandchildren so that we do not give them this $5 trillion debt that we \nare bumping up against in 2 weeks in this country.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. THOMAS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Texas.\n  I think it is extremely important that we walk through this bill; it \nis a large bill; it covers lots of things; but to talk about how it \nwill affect each of us as citizens of this country. And so I \ncongratulate the Senator on doing that.\n  Let me just observe that one of the principal things we are doing is \nthinking about young people, is talking about what kind of shape we \nwant this country to be in when we go into a new century. We have maxed \nout on our credit card. We charged it to the young people who are \ncoming, and it is time we do something about that.\n  I now yield our time remaining to the Senator from Washington State.\n  Mr. GORTON.

Mr. President, I am pleased to be able to introduce to \nMembers of the Senate Peter Dugulescu, a Member of the Romanian \nParliament. Peter is a friend of mine of some time, and was influential \nin bringing much greater levels of democracy to Romania.\n  As a matter of fact, when the revolution in Romania began, he was \npart of a crowd in the city of Timisoara where 100,000 people had \ngathered one day to protest the lack of religious freedom there. They \nhad called for a pastor to come to speak to the crowd. And no one felt \nconfident enough in the regime to come and speak to the crowd. And \nPeter finally offered himself to the crowd.\n\n[[Page S 16465]]\n\n  This was during the days of President Ceausescu. When Peter went to \nspeak to the crowd and lead them in prayer, it was a turning point in \nthe revolution of Romania.

And I \njust wanted to thank the Senate for the opportunity to allow me to \ncommend him, not only for the example he has set for his fellow \ncitizens in Romania, but to commend him for the kind of example he \nsets, his dedication of principle and commitment to strong ideals and \nvalues and commitment to his God and recommend him to citizens around \nthe world.\n  I thank the Senator from Washington for allowing me to make this \ninterruption.

Mr. President, I have heard many of the comments of my \neloquent and thoughtful Republican colleagues about the reconciliation \nbill and the budget which has just been passed, their thoughtfulness \nwith respect to the way we have caused the Medicare system to be \npreserved, protected, and strengthened, the fact that in doing so the \npercentage of the premium which individuals will pay for their Medicare \npart B coverage will not be increased, except for those who are wealthy \nenough to be able to afford and who, for that matter, ought to pay for \na greater portion of the cost of their health care rather than passing \nthat cost onto the backs of working Americans.\n  I have heard, particularly, the references of my colleagues to the \nlong-sought and most welcomed reductions in the tax burdens on the \nAmerican people. But, Mr. President, I want to emphasize one aspect of \nthose tax reductions which have frequently before been overlooked. \nWhile there is in total almost $250 billion in tax relief for the \nAmerican people in the reconciliation bill this body passed early last \nSaturday morning, the overwhelming bulk of those tax reductions, 80 \npercent of them, in fact, comes from two sources: The closing of \ncertain corporate and business tax loopholes amounting to about 10 \npercent of the gross tax reductions and a $170 billion dividend which \nthe Congressional Budget Office has told us will be the benefit to the \nFederal Treasury of passing a budget which clearly will be balanced by \nthe year 2002.\n  Mr. President, I think that is a vitally important concept. The \ntangible dividend to the American people of our balancing the budget \nwill be $170 billion in lower interest payments on the Federal debt and \nan increased tax collection under the present system because of greater \nprosperity, more opportunity, more employment, a better lifestyle that \na balanced budget will give to the people of the United States.\n  Mr. President, that is the overwhelming source of the tax reductions \nthat are included in this bill. We, as Republicans, believe that if we \nbalance the budget, that dividend ought to go to the American people, \nnot to further or for additional spending programs. And that profoundly \ndifferentiates ourselves from our opponents in this battle who \nconsistently have demanded more spending on the part of the Federal \nGovernment.\n  Now, Mr. President, perhaps the most remarkable illustration of the \ndifferences between two of the three sides of this battle is the fact \nthat the President of the United States claims that he has presented a \nbalanced budget when, in fact, he has not done so but has simply \nestimated the deficit out of existence.\n  The Congressional Budget Office, the agreed upon arbiter of the \nfiscal direction in which this country is proceeding, has offered us no \ndividend in connection with President Clinton's budget proposals. Not \n$170 billion, not $150 billion, not $10 billion have they offered us \nshould we pass the President's budget. Why? Because, of course, under \nCongressional Budget Office figures, it does not balance in the year \n2002. In fact, it barely gets below $200 billion at any time between \nnow and that year. That is perhaps the greatest single illustration of \nthe proposition that the White House offers us stones for bread, that \nit gives us nothing that will ever lead us to a balanced budget and \ndoes nothing in the way of a fiscal dividend to the American people and \nthus no source for tax relief for the people of the United States.\n  That $170 billion dividend, I wish to emphasize, is only the dividend \nthat a balanced budget provides for the Treasury of the United States. \nIt is perhaps one-quarter to one-third of the overall benefit to the \nAmerican people. If we pass a law which will cause the budget to be \nbalanced, in addition to that $170 billion in a return of lower taxes, \nthe American people will benefit to the tune of $300, $400, $500 \nbillion in higher wages, in greater income, in broader opportunities, \nin economic growth in the country as a whole.\n  So, what we have done, Mr. President, is that we have passed a set of \nproposals which will improve the condition of the American economy and \nthe American people by close to $1 trillion between now and the year \n2002. If only we can get the White House to agree to it or to agree to \na budget which has the same impact.\n  That is a magnificent triumph, Mr. President. I believe it is \nunprecedented at any time in the last two or three decades. And in \naddition to all of the other dividenda that come from a smaller \nGovernment, less control and influence on the part of the Government \nover our lives, a reform of the welfare system, the preservation of \nMedicare, in addition to all of these other dividends, is this \npotential for a better and a more prosperous America. And that, Mr. \nPresident, is the justification for what we propose to do, and what we \npassed in this body late last Friday night or early last Saturday \nmorning.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Ashcroft). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, was leader time reserved?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. DOLE. I thank the Chair.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Lugar, Mr. Dole, and Mr. Craig pertaining to the \nintroduction of S. 1373 are located in today's Record under \n``Statements on Introduced Bills and Joint Resolutions.'')\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/11/01/senate-section/article/S16465-2", "month": "11", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "01", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S16465-S16466]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              RURAL LOCAL INITIATIVES SUPPORT CORPORATION\n\n  Mr. BOND.

I thank \nthem for their tireless efforts in support of finding new ways to \nleverage funding through public-private partnerships for addressing the \nhousing and economic needs of rural, distressed communities.\n  I emphasize that rural communities face an economic decline of \nsubstantial \n\n[[Page S 16466]]\n\nmagnitude. Nearly 17 percent of rural Americans live below the poverty \nlevel, and across all major racial, ethnic, and age groups, these \nresidents are poorer than those in metropolitan areas and have less \nopportunity. While most of the rural poor are working, their wages are \nat or below minimum wage. The rural poor also face a bleak housing \nsituation--one in four poor rural families live in substandard housing, \nand nearly half pay over 50 percent of their income for rent. A lack of \nhuman and financial capital, as well as an inadequate physical and \ncommunications infrastructure, compound the economic and housing \ndifficulties that face the rural poor.\n  Earlier this month, I chaired a hearing before the Senate Committee \non Small Business which focused on proposals to revitalize rural and \nurban communities and Paul Grogan, president of LISC, provided \ninsightful testimony at that time. At this hearing, we had the \nopportunity to discuss legislation I am drafting to target Federal \ncontracts to small businesses that locate in economically distressed \ncommunities, which I call HUBZones. To be eligible, small businesses \nwould need to hire at least 35 percent of its work force from the \nHUBZone to receive valuable preference in bidding on Government \ncontracts. I believe this is one way the Federal Government can provide \na significant incentive to encourage small businesses to provide a \nvalue added in terms of jobs and investment to economically distressed \nrural communities.\n  I applaud the efforts and commitment of LISC for establishing the \nrural LISC initiative which will be responsible for a public-private \npartnership that will commit over $300 million to 68 nonprofits in 39 \nStates and Puerto Rico for community revitalization efforts in rural \nareas. LISC has a longstanding commitment to finding new approaches and \nstrategies to address the problems of distressed communities through \npublic-private partnerships. Moreover, LISC has long operated as a \nlinchpin to successful community-based investment in urban areas \nthrough community development corporations. I emphasize that I support \nthe need to develop public-private partnerships as the primary vehicle \nto implement positive and community-based policies to address \ndistressed communities, in both urban and rural areas. For too long, \nthe Federal Government has acted as a ``Mother-May-I'' that has lost \ntouch with the individual needs of individual communities. Most of the \ncurrent housing reform legislation, whether in through the \nappropriation or authorization process, recognizes the need to \nconsolidate housing and community development programs and to redirect \nthe responsibility for decisionmaking from the Federal Government to \nState and local governments.\n  In particular, like many urban areas, the Federal Government has been \nunable to establish effective policies to meet the many and unique \nneeds of rural areas. LISC deserves particular praise for taking a \nleadership role in organizing and focusing its expertise, resources, \nand the marshalling of public and private sector capital on the unique \nand individual needs of rural areas. Rural LISC represents a major and \nsignificant new public-private partnership which will direct critical \nnew investment to rural CDC's. I emphasize these CDC's are committed to \ntransforming rural distressed communities from the grassroots up.\n  Finally, the Federal Government has failed to understand the needed \ndynamic to solve local problems in distressed communities. Instead of \nmandating one-size-fits-all policies at the Federal level, Congress and \nthe Federal Government need to refocus the decisionmaking for local \ncommunities from the Federal Government back to States and localities. \nLISC brings to the table expertise and a history of commitment of \nlistening and responding to local needs. I expect the rural LISC \npublic/private partnership approach to provide a powerful tool and \nmodel for how best to address the needs of rural areas effectively and \nefficiently.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/11/01/senate-section/article/S16465-3", "month": "11", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "01", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S16466-S16467]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            HHS REPORT ON THE SENATE AND HOUSE WELFARE BILLS\n\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, a September 14, 1995, report by the \nDepartment of Health and Human Services concludes that the Senate \nwelfare bill would push 1,100,000 children into poverty, and that the \nHouse bill would force 2 million children below the poverty line. The \nreport, which has not been officially released by HHS, was the subject \nof a front-page news story in the Los Angeles Times on Friday, October \n27. The New York Times and Washington Post ran their own stories about \nthe report the next day.\n  I first learned of the existence of this report 2 weeks ago, but was \nunable to obtain a copy until last Friday. The administration had \npreviously refused to acknowledge that any such report existed.\n  Mr. President, over the years Congress has on occasion missed \nopportunities to help our Nation's dependent children, but never before \nin our history have we calculatedly set out to injure them. The \nadministration's own analysis shows that this is precisely what will \noccur under either bill now before the conference committee on welfare. \nSurely we will not permit this to happen. Surely the President will not \npermit this to happen.\n  I urge all Senators to read the administration's report, and I ask \nunanimous consent that it be printed in Record.\n  There being no objection, the report was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n  The Preliminary Impact of the Senate Republican Welfare Proposal on \n         Children (The Work Opportunity Act of 1995 (S. 1120))\n\n\n             the impact on poverty and income distribution\n\n       On Child Poverty:\n       S. 1120 will push 1.1 million more children into poverty, \n     an increase of almost 11 percent in the number of children \n     living below the poverty line.\n       The child poverty rate will rise from 14.5 percent to 16.1 \n     percent. (See methodology for a description of the poverty \n     measure used.)\n       On Poverty in Families:\n       An additional 1.9 million persons in families with children \n     will fall below the poverty line.\n       The poverty gap for families with children will increase \n     $4.1 billion, or 25 percent. As a result, a total of $4.1 \n     billion in additional income will be required to bring these \n     families up to the poverty threshold.\n       On Income Distribution:\n       The poorest families will face the largest program cuts \n     under S. 1120. In families with children, those in the lowest \n     income quintile will lose an average of almost $800 of their \n     annual income, or 6 percent.\n       Eleven percent of families with children in the lowest \n     income quintile will face significant losses in annual income \n     of 15 percent or more. For families in the lowest quintile, \n     who have an average income of $13,400, this represents a loss \n     of more than $2,000 in annual income.\n       The severity of the impact of S. 1120 on poor families \n     exacerbates the deteriorating economic situation for these \n     families who have lost a greater share of their income in the \n     past 15 years than families with higher income. Income for \n     families with children in the lowest income quintile has \n     declined by 20.7 percent over the period 1979-1990, compared \n     to 24 percent growth for families in the highest income \n     quintile.\n\n   TABLE 1.--THE IMPACT OF THE SENATE WELFARE REFORM PROPOSAL ON CHILD  \n                                 POVERTY                                \n       [Simulates effects of full implementation in 1993 dollars]       \n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                          Current     Senate     Change \n                                            law      proposal   current \n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n           CHILDREN UNDER 18                                            \n                                                                        \nNumber of people in poverty (in                                         \n millions).............................       10.1       11.2        1.1\nPoverty rate (in percent)..............       14.5       16.1        1.6\n                                                                        \n         FAMILIES WITH CHILDREN                                         \n                                                                        \nNumber of people in poverty (in                                         \n millions).............................       17.1       19.0        1.9\nPoverty rate (in percent)..............       11.8       13.2        1.5\nPoverty gap (in billions)..............      $16.3      $20.4       $4.1\n                                                                        \n              ALL PERSONS                                               \n                                                                        \nNumber of people in poverty (in                                         \n millions..............................       29.2       30.5        2.3\nPoverty rate (in percent)..............       10.9       11.7        0.8\nPoverty gap (in billions)..............      $45.9      $52.0       $5.1\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n85tes: Senate Republican welfare reform proposal simulations include the\n  impact of S. 1120, as amended, on AFDC, SSI, and Food Stamps.

Overall, these estimates tend to be a \n     conservative measure of the impact of S. 1120 on poverty and \n     income distribution. The analysis assumes that states will \n     continue to operate the program like the current AFDC program \n     (i.e., they will service all families eligible for \n     assistance); that states will maintain their 1994 spending \n     levels; and that recipients are not cut off from benefits \n     prior to the five year limit. Additionally, the results are \n     conservative because not all provisions are included and \n     because the data do not identify all persons who would \n     potentially be affected by the program cuts. The model also \n     assumes dynamic change in the labor supply response for those \n     affected by the time limit provision, based on the best \n     academic estimates of labor supply response.\n       The results compare the impact of the Senate Republican \n     welfare reform proposal with current law. The computer \n     simulations include the impact of the fully implemented \n     provisions in S. 1120, as amended, on AFDC, SSI, and the Food \n     Stamp Program in 1996 dollars and population. S. 1120 will \n     decrease spending on AFDC-related programs by $8.8 billion, \n     in 1996 dollars. Spending on children formerly eligible for \n     SSI will decline by $1.5 billion. The Food Stamp Program will \n     be reduced by $1.5 billion.\n       The poverty analysis is displayed in 1993 dollars. The \n     definition of poverty in this analysis utilities a measure of \n     income that includes cash income plus the value of food \n     stamps, school lunches, housing programs, and the EITC less \n     federal taxes. This income is then compared to the Census \n     Bureau's poverty thresholds, adjusted for family size. For \n     example, a family of three today (1995), is living in poverty \n     with the income below $12,183; a family of four with income \n     below $15,610.\n       The following are the specific provisions of S. 1120 that \n     were modeled (these provisions may not reflect the final \n     version of the Senate welfare reform bill):\n\n\n                                  afdc\n\n       Reduce AFDC spending as a result of the block grant; Limit \n     receipt of AFDC benefits to five years with a 15 percent \n     hardship exemption; Deny benefits to immigrants; and \n     Eliminate $50 child support disregard.\n       Deny benefits to immigrants; and Deny benefits to some \n     children formerly eligible because of changes in the \n     definition of disabilities.\n\n\n                                 stamps\n\n       Reduce the standard deduction; Reduce benefits to eligible \n     households from 103 percent of the cost of the Thrifty Food \n     Plan to 100 percent; include energy assistance as income in \n     determining a household's eligibility and benefits; Eliminate \n     indexing for one- and two-person households; and Lower age \n     cutoff for disregard of students' earned income from 21 to 15 \n     years; Require single, childless adults to work.\n\n    TABLE 1.--THE IMPACT OF CONGRESSIONAL PROPOSALS ON CHILD POVERTY    \n       [Simulates effects of full implementation in 1993 dollars]       \n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                                 Change \n                                          Current     House       from  \n                                            law     proposals   current \n                                                                  law   \n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n           CHILDREN UNDER 18                                            \n                                                                        \nNumber of people in poverty (in                                         \n millions).............................       10.1       12.1        2.0\nPoverty rate (in percent)..............       14.5       17.4        2.9\n                                                                        \n         FAMILIES WITH CHILDREN                                         \n                                                                        \nNumber of people in poverty (in                                         \n millions).............................       17.1       20.6        3.5\nPoverty rate (in percent)..............       11.8       14.2        2.4\nPoverty gap (in billions)..............       16.3       24.5        8.1\n                                                                        \n              ALL PERSONS                                               \n                                                                        \nNumber of people in poverty (in                                         \n millions).............................       28.2       32.2        4.0\nPoverty rate (in percent)..............       10.9       12.4        1.5\nPoverty gap (in billions)..............       46.9       55.8        9.9\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nNotes: The comparison shown is between Congressional House Republicans  \n  proposals and current law.

Mr. President, I rise in strong opposition to the budget \nexpenditure limit tool, known as the BELT, that would place artificial \nprice caps on Medicare and jeopardize the quality of the health care \nreceived by millions of senior citizens. I ask unanimous consent to \nhave printed in the Record at the conclusion of my remarks several \nletters of support for the motion I had planned to make to strike the \nBELT. It is imperative that the Senate strike this ill-advised \nprovision in order to preserve Medicare beneficiaries' ability to \nchoose their own doctor and health plan.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered\n  (See exhibit 1c)\n  Mr. CONRAD. In the interest of time, the point-of-order I had planned \nto make against the BELT provision has been included in the omnibus \nByrd rule point of order being made by Senator Exon. However, I believe \nit is important to highlight the impact of the BELT, because it is a \npotential disaster for the Medicare Program and has not received \nanywhere near the attention it deserves.\n  The BELT amounts to what many of us have called a noose around the \nnecks of older Americans. The BELT imposes artificial price caps on \nMedicare for the first time in history. And rather than work in a \nbalanced fashion, the BELT only attacks fee-for-service Medicare. It \ncuts fee for service and ultimately forces seniors to use health plans \nthey don't want and doctors they don't know.\n  The reconciliation bill allows seniors to choose coverage options \nother than traditional Medicare fee-for-service. I support that. But I \nonly support it as an option. Seniors should not be forced into managed \ncare. Unfortunately, the BELT could ultimately make managed care the \nonly option for Medicare beneficiaries.\n  The BELT renders the so-called choice under Medicare an illusion. \nThere will be more choice for a short time. But then the noose will \ntighten. It will slowly bleed fee-for-service Medicare dry. And if we \nlearned anything from last year's health care debate, it is that health \nplans with insufficient resources will wither on the vine. And given \nyesterday's remarks by the Speaker of the House, that seems to be what \nsome of my Republican colleagues have in mind for the Medicare Program.\n  The BELT promises to make even more draconian cuts in Medicare fee-\nfor-service than the Republicans have already proposed. As the BELT \ntightens, Medicare will have fewer resources to provide needed health \ncare to our parents and grandparents. The quality of Medicare fee-for-\nservice will deteriorate and seniors will have little choice but to \nmove into managed care. Medicare fee-for-service will wither on the \nvine.\n  During last year's health debate, we heard a great deal about \nartificial government cost controls. Harry and Louise told the Nation \nthat arbitrary cost controls could bankrupt the insurance plans on \nwhich millions of Americans depend, leaving people without adequate \ninsurance coverage.\n  The BELT provision does to Medicare what Harry and Louise said \nartificial cost controls would do to the national health care system. \nIt inflicts arbitrary cost controls on Medicare at a moment's notice, \nand without congressional oversight. And it will force seniors into \nhealth care plans that may not meet their needs.\n  The letters I have entered into the Record expressed the concern of \nbeneficiaries and providers, alike, that the BELT will erode the \nintegrity of Medicare. The American Association of Retired Persons, \nNational Council of Seniors Citizens, American College of Physicians, \nHealthcare Association of New York State, and North Dakota Hospital \nAssociation are only a handful of those who have expressed opposition \nto the BELT. The Congressional Budget Office has also said the BELT is \nunworkable and unwise, and I ask unanimous consent that CBO's analysis \nalso be included in the Record.\n  Mr. President, the BELT has no place in this bill. It promises to \nerode and eventually destroy the integrity of Medicare fee-for-service. \nI hope my colleagues will support the point of order and strike the \nBELT provision from the bill.\n\n[[Page S 16468]]\n\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n\n                            North Dakota Hospital Association,\n\n                                   Bismarck, ND, October 25, 1995.\n     Senator Kent Conrad,\n     Hart Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Kent: The members of North Dakota Hospital Association \n     are in strong support of your amendment to strike the \n     Medicare Budget Enforcement Limiting Tool (BELT) from the \n     Senate Reconciliation Bill.\n       It is our understanding that the proposed Senate Republican \n     Medicare legislation to reach $270 billion in Medicare cuts \n     reduces payments to hospitals by more than $86 billion over \n     seven years. On top of that, legislation has been proposed to \n     also reduce Medicaid funds to hospitals by $182 billion \n     during that same amount of time. The magnitude of these \n     reductions causes great concern for North Dakota, which has a \n     large and growing population of citizens over 65 years of \n     age.\n       In visiting with our administrators, they are hard pressed \n     to understand how they can cut budget or plan to serve this \n     population and others, when the BELT provision would entail \n     additional reductions based on whether or not certain savings \n     are achieved.\n       A number of our facilities, Cavalier County Memorial \n     Hospital in Langdon; Jamestown Hospital in Jamestown, Tioga \n     Medical Center in Tioga and Carrington Medical Center in \n     Carrington have all publicly expressed concerns that the \n     amount of proposed reductions, with lookbacks added, will \n     mean that in seven years they cannot guarantee that their \n     doors will be open.\n       Half of our facilities are co-located with and include \n     long-term care facilities. Those that care for a large \n     percentage of Medicare patients in their hospital and mostly \n     Medicaid supported residents in their nursing homes will \n     receive a double hit from which they also might not be able \n     to recover. In a rural state like ours, you can imagine that \n     access becomes a critical issue if a void is left in an area \n     where distances can mean the difference between life and \n     death.\n       It seems grossly unfair to single out healthcare providers \n     as the group responsible for obtaining savings not achieved. \n     It also seems grossly unfair to ask a particular segment of \n     the business world in our country to operate with a system in \n     which orderly business operations would be interrupted based \n     on a compliance order not determined until the very last \n     minute.\n       Our facilities are operating as cost-efficiently as \n     possible, while still maintaining the quality expected of \n     them by their patients. We feel it is imperative to the \n     solvency and survivability of many of our providers that the \n     BELT provision be excluded. NDHA supports your efforts and \n     hopes your fellow legislators will understand how detrimental \n     this provision would be to the healthcare facilities in our \n     state and also support you in this effort.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 Arnold R. Thomas,\n     President.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                            Healthcare Association\n\n\n                                            of New York State,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, October 24, 1995.\n     Senator Kent Conrad,\n     Hart Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Conrad: On behalf of the Healthcare \n     Association of New York State, representing over 400 \n     hospitals and health care providers, I would like to take \n     this opportunity to express our support for your amendment to \n     the Senate Budget Reconciliation Bill that would strike the \n     Medicare Budget Enforcement Limiting Tool (BELT).\n       The Senate Republican Medicare legislation currently under \n     consideration will be devastating to the health care delivery \n     system. The $270 billion of Medicare cuts that would be \n     required by the legislation would reduce Medicare hospital \n     payments by more than $86 billion over the next seven years. \n     Reductions of this magnitude, combined with $182 billion in \n     proposed Medicaid cuts, would jeopardize the ability of \n     health care providers to adequately care for our nation's \n     senior citizens.\n       The Medicare BELT provision could exacerbate these already \n     tremendous reductions. By placing absolute Medicare spending \n     limits in the statute, health care providers that will \n     already be receiving payment updates that do not keep pace \n     with inflation could be faced with additional reductions--\n     even if cost overruns are due to conditions beyond providers \n     control.\n       There are many factors that contribute to increases in \n     Medicare spending that can not be predicted in advance with \n     absolute certainty. Placing the weight of a Medicare global \n     budget on the backs of health care providers could mean \n     absolute rate cuts and threaten the solvency of many \n     hospitals, nursing facilities, home-health agencies, and \n     other health care providers. It is critical that the BELT \n     provision be dropped from Senate Medicare legislation and \n     HANYS supports your efforts.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                     Steven Kroll,\n     Director of Federal Relations.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n\n                                American Hospital Association,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, October 25, 1995.\n     Senator Kent Conrad,\n     Senate Hart Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Conrad: We are pleased to lend our strong \n     support for your amendment to strike the budget expenditure \n     limiting tool (BELT) from the budget reconciliation bill.\n       As you know, the bill calls for reductions of $86 billion \n     in hospital services over seven years. This unprecedented \n     level of reductions in the Medicare program will have a \n     dramatic impact on the ability of hospitals across the nation \n     to continue to provide high quality care, not only to \n     Medicare beneficiaries but to all our patients. If the BELT \n     remains part of the bill, providers could be exposed to \n     unlimited additional payment reductions beyond the deep cuts \n     already proposed.\n       We are not only concerned about potential additional \n     reductions, but also that these reductions would be made for \n     reasons beyond hospitals' control. For example, if certain \n     reforms not related to hospital behavior do not achieve the \n     level of savings estimated by the Congressional Budget \n     Office, then hospital payments would be arbitrarily cut. \n     That's simply unfair given the $86 billion cut we are already \n     being asked to absorb.\n       Even CBO, in a letter to Chairman Roth dated October 20, \n     1995, states that the ``use of the BELT would not be \n     necessary.''\n       Thank you for your leadership on this important issue.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                     Rick Pollack,\n     Executive Vice President.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                                  National Council\n\n\n                                           of Senior Citizens,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, October 26, 1995.\n     Hon. Kent Conrad,\n     U.S. Senate, Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Conrad: The National Council of Senior \n     Citizens supports your motion to strike from the Medicare \n     section of the Reconciliation bill the ``BELT'' provision. \n     This provision would severely cut resources from the \n     traditional Medicare fee-for-service program and would \n     restrict the range of ``choices'' generated by the \n     ``reformed'' Medicare program. Average-to-lower income \n     Medicare beneficiaries would be forced from fee-for-service \n     into cut-rate, managed care programs.\n       Senator, a ``choice'' you can't afford is no choice at all.\n       We support your motion.\n           Sincerely,\n                                               Daniel J. Schulder,\n     Director, Department of Legislation.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n\n                                                         AARP,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, October 26, 1995.\n     Hon. Kent Conrad,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC\n       Dear Senator Conrad: I am writing to express AARP's \n     appreciation for the amendment you are planning to offer to \n     strike the Budget Enforcement Limiting Tool (BELT) from the \n     Medicare provisions of the Senate budget reconciliation bill. \n     The BELT proposal would reduce traditional Medicare Fee-for-\n     Service (FFS) provider reimbursements if Medicare spending in \n     a fiscal year is projected to exceed an arbitrary amount set \n     in the bill. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimates \n     that the provisions contained in the bill would meet the \n     budget resolution target of saving $270 billion over the \n     period between 1996 and 2002 and that the BELT would not be \n     required. However, the CBO estimate assumes that the plan \n     works, that is, that there is sufficient migration into \n     managed care, that the provider reductions and increased \n     premiums and deductibles control Medicare spending and that \n     CBO's baseline assumptions are correct.\n       If any of these variables are incorrect, then the formula-\n     driven BELT would reduce FFS spending to meet the targets set \n     in the bill. Formula-driven approaches to budget cutting have \n     always concerned AARP, in part, because of the rigidities \n     they build into the system and their inherent potential for \n     error and misestimation. This bureaucratic mechanism is one \n     of many in the huge 2,000 page budget bill that the public \n     knows nothing about. Older Americans will only find out about \n     in after the Senate acts.\n       Congress has structured this bill to create incentives for \n     beneficiaries to move into commercial health insurance plans \n     and has capped the growth of premiums paid into those plans. \n     The BELT provision would then cap the FFS part of the \n     program. AARP is concerned about what kind of coverage will \n     be available at the turn of the century. Will providers still \n     be willing to see patients in a FFS setting? Will commercial \n     health plans be willing to offer comprehensive coverage \n     without huge out-of-pocket costs for beneficiaries? Will \n     Medicare still be able to meet the health needs of older \n     Americans?\n       In addition, we believe the current structure of the BELT \n     contains silent beneficiary costs. For instance, under the \n     Senate bill the Part B premium is expected to cover 31.5 \n     percent of Part B annual spending. However, because the \n     Senate writes the dollar amount of the premiums into law, \n     rather than the percentage, and if the BELT is tightened and \n     program spending is lowered, these stated premiums would \n     account for more than 31.5 percent of annual spending. This \n     silently shifts more costs onto beneficiaries.\n       The same problem occurs with the Part A hospital \n     deductible. The deductible is based, in part, on Medicare's \n     payment to hospitals. If the deductible is calculated before \n     the BELT reduces Part A spending, it would be based on a \n     higher payment amount and would, in turn, shift more costs \n     onto Medicare beneficiaries.\n       AARP supports your amendment to strike the BELT provision \n     from the Medicare Reconciliation bill. We feel that the long-\n     term \n\n[[Page S 16469]]\n\n     risks to the program and the silent costs it imposes on \n     beneficiaries would be unfair. Older Americans already pay a \n     lot out of their own pockets for medical care--$2,750 on \n     average in 1995 alone--not including the costs associated \n     with long-term. The Senate bill already increases Part B \n     premiums and deductibles and includes a new income-related \n     premium.

Kent Conrad,\n     U.S. Senate, Hart Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Conrad: As the Director of Public Policy for \n     the American College of Physicians (ACP), I am writing to \n     express the ACP's support for your amendment to eliminate the \n     budget expenditure limit tool (BELT) from the Medicare reform \n     legislation currently pending before the Senate.\n       The ACP is the nation's largest medical specialty society \n     and has more than 85,000 members who practice internal \n     medicine and its subspecialties. The College has consistently \n     objected to the BELT provisions in the legislation because \n     they establish arbitrary budget limits that dictate future \n     payment amounts and impose price controls. These provisions \n     make the simplistic and incorrect assumption that spending \n     increases, regardless of cause, should be recouped by \n     lowering payments to hospitals, physicians, and other \n     providers.\n       Rather than arbitrary price controls, the College believes \n     that the more effective way to achieve cost containment in \n     the Medicare program, is to address the long-term factors \n     that contribute to excess capacity and inappropriate \n     utilization of services.\n       Thank you for your attention to this important matter.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                Howard B. Shapiro,\n     Director, Public Policy.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                                    U.S. Congress,\n\n\n                                  Congressional Budget Office,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, October 20, 1995.\n     Hon. William V. Roth, Jr.,\n     Chairman, Committee on Finance, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) \n     has prepared the enclosed cost estimate for the Medicare \n     reconciliation language reported by the Senate Committee on \n     Finance on October 17, 1995.\n       The estimate shows the budgetary effects of the committee's \n     proposals over the 1996-2002 period. CBO understands that the \n     Committee on the Budget will be responsible for interpreting \n     how these proposals compare with the reconciliation \n     instructions in the budget resolution.\n       This estimate assumes the reconciliation bill will be \n     enacted by November 15, 1995; the estimate could change if \n     the bill is enacted later.\n       If you wish further details on this estimate, we will be \n     pleased to provide them.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  June E. O'Neill,\n                                                         Director.\n       Enclosure.\n\n\n         Fail-Safe Mechanism (Budget Expenditure Limiting Tool)\n\n       The proposal incorporates a complex mechanism designed to \n     ensure that Medicare outlays in a given two year period would \n     not exceed the Medicare outlays specified in the bill for \n     that period. The budget expenditure limiting tool (BELT) \n     would operate both prospectively and retrospectively to \n     control fee-for-service expenditures. Expenditures in the \n     Choice market would not be directly affected because they \n     would be determined by the updates to capitation rates \n     specified in the bill.\n\n                          Overview of the BELT\n\n       The BELT would reduce fee-for-service payment rates in \n     order to eliminate any estimated Medicare ``outlay deficit''. \n     A Medicare outlay deficit would occur if spending in fee-for-\n     service Medicare for the current year and preceding one \n     exceeded the combined outlays for those years specified in \n     the bill. On October 15 of each year, the Office of \n     Management and Budget (OMB) would report whether a Medicare \n     outlay deficit was projected for that fiscal year. If so, a \n     compliance order would be issued that would first require all \n     automatic payment-rate updates to be frozen or reduced. If a \n     freeze was insufficient to keep projected spending within the \n     budget targets, proportional reductions would be made in \n     payment rates for all providers.\n       The following March, OMB would release a report comparing \n     current estimates of Medicare spending with the estimates \n     released in October. If a compliance order was in effect for \n     the year and the March projection continued to show a \n     Medicare outlay deficit through the end of the year (despite \n     previous rate reductions), the Administration would order \n     further reductions in provider payment rates for the \n     remainder of the fiscal year. Conversely, if the March \n     projection indicates that current payment rates would more \n     than eliminate the Medicare outlay deficit, those rates \n     would be raised for the remainder of the fiscal year.\n       Following the release of OMB's October and March reports, \n     the Congress would have a limited time in which to seek \n     modifications to compliance orders. At least 60 percent of \n     the members of each House would be required to approve \n     provisions that would either lower the target reduction in \n     spending or reduce the proposed payment reductions to less \n     than the amounts necessary to eliminate the projected excess \n     spending.\n       After fiscal year 1999, the Secretary of Health and Human \n     Services could vary the adjustments in payment rates--in a \n     budget-neutral way--to take geographical differences into \n     account. The Secretary would be required to relate such \n     variations to the contributions of different areas to excess \n     Medicare expenditures.\n\n                          Effects of the BELT\n\n       CBO's estimates assume that the specific policies to reduce \n     Medicare spending in the bill would be sufficient to meet \n     budget targets, and that use of the BELT would not be \n     necessary through 2002. If the BELT was triggered, however, \n     it probably would not be effective in controlling Medicare \n     expenditures.\n       Uniform, across-the-board payment rate reductions that \n     would be required by the BELT to meet a dollar savings target \n     would not have uniform impacts on all providers, and would be \n     extremely difficult to implement. A given percentage \n     reduction in payment rates might be more or less stringent \n     depending on the ability of different providers to adjust by \n     increasing the volume and intensity of services they provide. \n     Determining appropriate across-the-board reductions in \n     payment rates to meet the budget targets would be complex, \n     because estimators would have to take into account the \n     variation in behavioral responses from different provider \n     groups when faced with the same proportional reductions in \n     payment rates. Allowing geographic variation in payment rate \n     adjustments would add another layer of complexity to the \n     whole process.\n       Rate adjustments under the BELT could be both frequent and \n     inaccurate, and could increase uncertainty among providers. \n     The October adjustment would be based on incomplete data for \n     the previous fiscal year, and no data for the current year. \n     Although more complete data would be available for the March \n     adjustment, it would still include less than six months of \n     data from the current year. Even minor discrepancies between \n     the October and March projections would lead to payment rate \n     adjustments under the BELT. Frequent, unpredictable changes \n     in payment rates could interfere with the orderly business \n     operations of providers.\n       The proposal also raises other issues of implementation. \n     Compliance orders issued in October and March are intended to \n     be effective immediately. Even if formal public notification \n     requirements were waived, however, carriers and fiscal \n     intermediaries would presumably require some advance notice. \n     Moreover, the first steps in a compliance order would be to \n     freeze or reduce automatic payment updates. But those updates \n     do not generally occur at the beginning of the federal fiscal \n     year. Updates for Part B payment rates, for example, are made \n     on a calendar year basis while those for inpatient hospital \n     operating payments are made at the beginning of each \n     hospital's fiscal year. How across-the-board cuts in payment \n     rates from the BELT would be integrated with the existing \n     update policy is unclear.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/11/01/senate-section/article/S16467-1", "month": "11", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "01", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S16469]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         THE BAD DEBT BOXSCORE\n\n  Mr. HELMS.

Mr. President, as a member of the Senate Subcommittee on \nTransportation Appropriations, I am pleased to speak in support of the \nfiscal year 1996 Transportation appropriations conference report. This \nis an important piece of legislation, providing $37.5 billion for \npurposes including funding our Nation's highway, rail, and air \ntransportation infrastructure, mass transit, Amtrak, and pipeline \nsafety. This legislation will keep Americans on the move, create jobs, \nand improve our infrastructure, resulting in additional environmental \nand energy benefits.\n  I commend Chairman Hatfield and our ranking minority member, Senator \n\n[[Page S 16470]]\n\nLautenberg, for their efforts in negotiating this comprehensive bill \nand for recognizing the particular importance of some provisions to \nPennsylvania, including highway and transit funding levels.\n  Given the difficult budget constraints faced by the subcommittee, I \nam particularly pleased that the bill provides $750 million for Amtrak, \nincluding improvements to the Northeast corridor. Amtrak service is \nessential to Pennsylvanians and I have long stressed the importance of \nensuring the viability of a truly national passenger rail service.\n  The conference report has also adopted a $1.45 billion funding level \nfor airport construction grants-in-aid, $200 million more than the \nSenate version of the bill. The statement of managers directs the \nFederal Aviation Administration to fairly consider a letter of intent \napplication from Philadelphia International Airport, which has sought \nfunding for construction of a new runway.\n  Given the significance to Pittsburgh of the airport busway project, I \nam very pleased that the conference report provides $31.6 million for \nfiscal year 1996 to continue construction. I urged our subcommittee to \nprovide this level of funding because this project will ease traffic \ncongestion between downtown and the Pittsburgh International Airport \nand will mitigate the impact of the Fort Pitt Bridge closing, which \nwould otherwise create a monumental headache for Pittsburgh residents. \nWith spending cutbacks in so many areas, we are fortunate to get this \nsubstantial amount of funds for the busway, which means so much to \npeople who live in the Pittsburgh area.\n  I remain disappointed that the conference report only provides $400 \nmillion for mass transit operating assistance, which will lead to cuts \nof as much as 40 percent for some transit systems. In fiscal year 1995, \ntransit systems received $710 million in Federal operating assistance, \nwhich they used to keep fares down and maintain service. On August 9, \nmy distinguished colleague from Pennsylvania, Senator Santorum, and I \noffered an amendment to restore $40 million to the $400 million \nprovided in this bill for mass transit operating assistance. \nUnfortunately, our amendment was defeated by 68 to 30.\n  As always, I remain committed to the millions of Pennsylvanians and \nother Americans who rely on public transit to commute to work, shop, \nand carry on their lives. Mass transit operating assistance keeps the \nNation moving by keeping fares lower and maintaining existing routes. \nPennsylvania's citizens and communities depend on good public \ntransportation for mobility, access to jobs, environmental control, and \neconomic stability. It lets the elderly visit their health care \nproviders, shops, or friends. In rural areas, buses are essential to \nreduce isolation and ensure economic development. And, children use \npublic transportation to go to school in some areas. Without affordable \nmass transit people in America's inner cities can't get to work. \nCongress has been considering welfare reform and requirements that \npeople have jobs. If they can't afford to get to work, or bus routes \nare cut, we are just making it that much harder for lower income \nAmericans to get off welfare.\n  Although I am troubled by the extent of the mass transit assistance \ncuts, on balance the Transportation appropriations bill is a good bill, \ncontaining much else of importance to Pennsylvania and the Nation, and \nthat is why I supported the conference report as a conferee. However, I \nintend to keep up my efforts next year to preserve funding for mass \ntransit, and to work with our chairman to ensure that Congress does not \ngo too far, too fast in reducing assistance to transit agencies \nthroughout the Nation.\n  In closing, Mr. President, I would note that the conference report \ncontains a provision on telecommuting that I authored, section 345, \nwhich requires the Secretary of Transportation to study successful \nprivate and public sector telecommuting programs and to disseminate to \nthe general public and to Congress information about the benefits and \ncosts of telecommuting. As my colleagues are aware, telecommuting is \nthe practice of allowing people to work either at home or in nearby \ncenters located closer to their home during their normal working hours, \nsubstituting telecommunications services, either partially or fully, \nfor transportation to the traditional workplace. I believe that it is \nin the national interest to encourage the use of telecommuting because \nit can enable flexible family-friendly employment, reduce air \npollution, and conserve energy. Further, as a Senator from \nPennsylvania, with major urban areas such as Pittsburgh and \nPhiladelphia, I recognize there is a real need to improve the quality \nof life in and around America's cities.\n  According to a July, 1994 Office of Technology Assessment report, \nbetween 2 to 8 million American workers already telecommute at least \npart time. A 1994 survey by the Conference Board found, however, that \nin 155 businesses nationwide, only 1 percent of employees telecommute, \nalthough 72 percent of the businesses had such an option. According to \nthe Office of Technology Assessment, the most significant barriers to \ntelecommuting are business and worker acceptance and costs. My \nprovision responds to the need to broaden public awareness of the \nbenefits and costs of telecommuting, and to identify and highlight \nsuccessful programs that can be duplicated.\n  Mr. President, the fiscal year 1996 Transportation appropriations \nconference report is worthwhile legislation and deserves to be signed \ninto law by the President.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/11/01/senate-section/article/S16469-2", "month": "11", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "01", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S16470]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           ORDER OF PROCEDURE\n\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, let me indicate to my colleagues that we are \nnot going to proceed on the instructions to conferees at this point on \nthe so-called reconciliation package. We may do it the next day. We may \ndo it next week, but not today. It seems to me that we need to first \ntalk to the President of the United States. Hopefully, we will get to \ndo that this afternoon.\n  One of the things the President complained about is that we are not \npassing appropriations bills. I would like to now turn to the \nconference report to accompany the foreign operations appropriations \nbill, if there is no objection.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, Senator Dole, the majority leader, and I \nhad the opportunity to talk yesterday. It was my understanding that we \nwere going to go to the conference. I understand his reasons for \ndelaying the consideration of the conference matters until a later \ntime, subject to discussion with the President.\n  I am disappointed that we have not had the opportunity to talk about \nthis until this very moment. But I would hope that if we would go to \nthe foreign operations and work through it in good faith, there is no \nreason why--I know there are some difficult issues out there that we \nare going to have to address, but I know the majority leader is \ncognizant of our schedule this evening. I hope we can accommodate that \nschedule. I will work with him to see that we can work through this \nbill and deal with the issues that we must confront prior to the time \nwe resolve this matter.\n  This is one of the bills that the President has indicated that he \nought to be able to support and sign. But, obviously, there are some \ntroubling issues that we have to work through, and we will do that.\n  With that understanding, I have no objection to moving to the foreign \noperations legislation.\n  Mr. DOLE. I appreciate the Democratic leader, Senator Daschle's \ncooperation. I was not aware of the other until about 11:50. I will \ntalk to the Senator privately about it. Senator Domenici came to my \noffice, and he feels that, at least as far as today is concerned, there \nis something else that is more important than discussing a motion to \ninstruct conferees. So we do now have consent to go to the foreign \noperations appropriations bill. There is one amendment in disagreement.\n  We will accommodate the schedule this evening, whatever happens.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I thank the majority leader.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/11/01/senate-section/article/S16470-1", "month": "11", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "01", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S16470-S16473]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n      FOREIGN OPERATIONS, EXPORT FINANCING, AND RELATED PROGRAMS \n              APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 1996--CONFERENCE REPORT\n\n  Mr. DOLE.

The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to proceed as in \nmorning business for 15 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Montana is recognized.\n  Mr. BURNS. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I would like to talk about yet another \nexample of Federal bureaucratic actions made without regard for the \nwill of the people, the will of the Congress, the good of the country \nand basic common sense. We need to restore a degree of sensibility and \nsanity to the manner in which this country gradually converts to the \nmetric system.\n  The 1988 trade bill contained language which established the metric \nsystem as the preferred system of measurement for the United States. \nWhy was the language on the trade bill? The rationale was that it would \nimprove the ability of American companies to export goods to metric-\nbased countries if American firms could be moved to produce those goods \nin metric versions.\n  The principal tool for urging American companies to switch to the \nmetric system has been to use government procurement policy. The trade \nbill included language ``to require that each Federal agency, by a date \ncertain and to the extent economically feasible by the end of the \nfiscal year 1992, use the metric system of measurement in its \nprocurement, grants, and other business-related acdtivities * * *.''\n  The problem I am addressing today arises from the unfortunate fact \nthat the Federal agencies responsible for implementing the metric \npolicy either forgot to read or are completely ignoring the remainder \nof the above sentence: ``* * * except to the extent that such use is \nimpractical or is likely to cause significant inefficiencies or loss of \nmarkets to U.S. firms, such as when foreign competitors are producing \ncompeting products in nonmetric units;''\n  Congress never intended for the switch to metrication to be forced at \nany cost or without regard to its impact on people and industry. Issues \nsuch as impracticality and the loss of markets to U.S. firms were \nparamount in the minds of everyone aware of this language. Without \nthese important considerations, the metric language would not have \nremained in the bill to become law.\n  Yet, we see today that Federal construction procurement policy for \nthe various departments and agencies is completely ignoring this \nlanguage and pushing ahead with metrication policies without any \nformalized plans for avoiding the pitfalls. In fact, they are going far \nbeyond the level of metrication called for in the trade bills, and that \nis causing staggering problems for some industries. These problems are \ncompounded by Federal procurement policies that hinder industry rather \nthan promote trade.\n  Simply converting an industry to metric units of measurement is \nusually not a major problem. Converting the numbers from inches and \npounds to millimeters and kilograms is a difference on paper which can \nbe made by editing the marketing literature and computer design \nprograms. The physical size of the product remains the same. This is \nknown as a soft-metric conversion, and does little to interfere with \nefficient and well-established production practices or costs. The \nGovernment is allowing a soft conversion for most construction \nindustries.\n  The problem is that some industries have been targeted to do more \nthan use metric units of measurement; they are being required to change \nthe size of their products as well. This is called a hard-metric \nconversion, and it can throw existing production practices into an \nuproar. At this point, industry is forced to change production \npractices. Even a minute change in size required by the Federal \nGovernment can force a business to completely retool and deal with all \nthe problems with managing a second, hard-metric inventory of goods. \nThis is Federal bureaucracy run amok.\n  And who picks up the tab for this intrusive Government policy? The \ntaxpayer, that is who. Converting to hard-metric will add to the cost \nof Federal contracting jobs. And the industry will be forced to pass \nalong the conversion costs to the Government and on down to the \ntaxpayer. Under hard-metrication, the taxpayers are forced to pay a \nhefty ``metric premium,'' whether they want to or not.\n   Mr. President, it is time to pass legislation that will take away \nthe ability of the Government in Washington DC, to send whole \nestablished industries into a tailspin, to put small businesses out of \nthe running for Federal contracts, and force the taxpayers to foot the \nbill for a warped view of metric purity.\n  There does not need to be a wholesale attack on the metric system. It \nis true that many industries can convert to the metric system with \nlittle or no trouble or expense, and that is fine. However, there are \nthose cases where there are substantial, compelling industry-specific \neconomic, trade or production factors that call for a soft-metric \nconversion. Industries that would bear unreasonable burdens in \nswitching to hard-metric should instead be allowed to convert to soft-\nmetric.\n  The Federal Government should refrain from developing or using \ndesigns, or requiring bids for hard-metric products when a soft-metric \nconversion is technologically feasible and certain other criteria \nrelating to specific small business, trade and economic criteria are \npresent:\n  The product is not available from at least 50 percent of the \nproduction sites, or hard-metric product does not constitute at least \n50 percent of the total domestic production, and;\n  A hard-metric conversion would require small manufacturers of a \nproduct to spend more than $25,000 to purchase new equipment, and;\n  The economics and customs of the industry are such that any \noffsetting trade benefits would be negligible, or that hard-metric \nconversion would either substantially reduce competition for federally \nassisted contracts or would increase the per-unit cost to the \ntaxpayers, or that hard-metric conversion would place small domestic \nproducers at a competitive disadvantage to foreign competitors.\n   Mr. President, metrication may well have merit on paper and may have \nsome positive impact on American business generally. Gut it is \ndifficult to say how much, if any, impact it is having on business. \nBusiness is usually good at making decisions based on sound-business \nsense. Which is more than I can say for the Federal Government in this \ncase.\n  We need to move legislation quickly, since I am aware that several \nFederal agencies are actively pursuing the development of hard-metric \ndesigns to be used on federally assisted construction. Federal agencies \nshould strongly consider putting their design and bidding efforts on \nhold if they involve hard-metric product.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have a letter printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                          National\n\n\n                                 Concrete Masonry Association,\n\n                                    Herndon, VA, October 26, 1995.\n     Hon. Conrad Burns,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Burns: I am very pleased to learn that you \n     have taken note of the plight the concrete masonry (C/M) \n     industry is facing with regard to the hard-metric con- \n     version the federal government is forcing on our producers. I \n     would like to take this opportunity to explain why hard-\n     metric conversion is terrible public policy, why it is so bad \n     for the C/M industry, for the federal procurement agents and \n     for the taxpayers, and why a soft-metric alternative is \n     absolutely imperative.\n\n[[Page S 16472]]\n\n       Concrete masonry is the industry term for concrete brick \n     and block. It is a very common, basic building component and \n     is essentially a commodity. It is made by pouring concrete \n     into molds of various shapes and sizes, and then drying the \n     product for the requisite amount of time. Over the course of \n     decades, the industry has developed uniform shapes and sizes \n     that are common throughout the construction industry. All C/M \n     manufacturers have purchased and maintain complete sets of \n     molds to make the product, and they maintain inventories of \n     various shapes and sizes.\n       Virtually all the producers in the country make product \n     based on the English foot-pounds system. That is because \n     virtually the entire American market uses English-based \n     block. The standard concrete block everyone knows is 8\" x 8\" \n     x 16\".\n       Even though the long history of the C/M industry is based \n     on the English system, it would be fairly simple to convert \n     to the metric system of measurement--if that were all that \n     Federal procurement officers required. The C/M industry has \n     made it very clear that it can convert to the metric system \n     immediately if that will satisfy the government's requirement \n     for metrication. All our producers have to do is express the \n     standard concrete block in metric dimensions, 194mm x 194mm x \n     397mm. That only requires a change in our sales materials and \n     some basic changes in our computer design programs. Changing \n     the unit of measurement without changing the physical size is \n     referred to as a soft-metric conversion.\n       However, the C/M industry is being told by federal \n     contracting agents that converting to metric is not enough, \n     that they want the industry to actually change the size of \n     its product to achieve metrication and round numbers. \n     Changing the physical size of the product in addition to \n     changing the unit of measurement is called a hard-metric \n     conversion.\n       There is nothing whatsoever in any legislation requiring a \n     hard-metric conversion of any product. The words do not \n     appear in any bill or any statement of policy by Congress. \n     There is no legislative history showing any desire by any \n     elected official to force any industry to change the size of \n     its products or to radically change their production \n     practices. If anything, the legislative history of the 1988 \n     Trade Bill and the metric language attached thereto clearly \n     indicates that this kind of intrusion into industry activity \n     was exactly what the Congress was trying to avoid.\n       According to publications issued by the Construction \n     Metrication Council, a group of federal construction policy \n     officials in various departments and agencies who are \n     coordinating metrication in U.S. construction, some \n     industries are being required to engage in hard-metric \n     conversion even in cases where it will be extremely costly, \n     inefficient, and impractical to do so. The large majority of \n     products will be allowed to use a soft-metric conversion, \n     which should be the policy for all products. But some \n     unfortunate businesses like the C/M industry have been \n     targeted for hard-metric conversion and are being thrown into \n     turmoil as a result.\n       The hard-metric block that the Council has defined is 190mm \n     x 190mm x 390mm. This is roughly one-eighth of an inch \n     smaller than the soft-metric version that the industry could \n     produce today at minimal or no additional cost. However, that \n     one-eighth of an inch difference for hard-metric would \n     require C/M manufacturers to purchase an entirely new set of \n     hard-metric molds in order to produce hard-metric product.\n       Concrete block molds generally range in cost from $10,000 \n     to $30,000 per mold, and it takes many types of shapes and \n     sizes to complete a typical large, complex federal \n     construction project. Individual C/M producers have told me \n     it could cost between $250,000 and $300,000 per producer to \n     buy a complete compliment of hard-metric molds. NCMA has \n     estimated that if the entire domestic C/M industry shifted to \n     hard-metric production, it would cost between $250 million \n     and $500 million.\n       That makes the government's eighth of an inch for hard-\n     metric the most expensive eighth of an inch in American \n     history.\n       Let's keep in mind that a hard-metric block is not \n     stronger, not safer, not more durable, not more resistant to \n     fire nor more energy efficient nor more anything useful. \n     Perhaps that is the reason why there is no demand whatsoever \n     in the American private sector for hard-metric concrete \n     block. Nobody wants it because there is no reason to want it. \n     The only difference is that it is more expensive, hard to \n     find and difficult to produce.\n       Requiring a business like the C/M industry to convert to \n     hard-metric shows an amazing lack of knowledge about or \n     concern for the industry itself. Let's keep in mind that the \n     rationale behind the metric language in the Trade Bill was to \n     promote the trade stance of American companies. It so turns \n     out that concrete masonry is only rarely traded in \n     international commerce and is nearly never transported \n     overseas. In addition, this is an industry whose product is \n     so much like a commodity that the average profit margin per \n     unit is 2 cents. The economics of the industry are such that \n     it isn't feasible to ship block to Europe or Japan or \n     anywhere beyond the border regions of Canada and Mexico. Most \n     block is used within 50 miles of the point of production. Any \n     trade benefit that might offset initial costs for other \n     industries is utterly negligible for the block industry.\n       But the consequences of this policy get even worse. The \n     vast majority of C/M producers in America are small, often \n     family-held businesses. In NCMA, 62 percent of all of our \n     member companies have one block-making machine. These \n     companies will immediately be pushed out of the market for \n     federal government contracts, the first victims of an \n     economically negligent metrication policy. There is no means \n     by which many smaller businesses can hope to recoup the huge \n     capital outlay required to start up an entirely new line of \n     products merely to satisfy the hard-metric preferences of \n     federal bureaucrats. There is virtually no private sector \n     demand for hard-metric product, so any income to offset the \n     capitalization cost would have to come from the occasional \n     federally-assisted project. Federally-assisted construction \n     is less than 5 percent of the entire domestic construction \n     market. Such projects are vitally important to the bottom \n     line of a successful bidder, but they are too infrequent in \n     most cases to justify the investment and, indeed, the risk, \n     of buying a new line of production molds and hoping enough \n     business comes along to eventually recover the initial \n     investment.\n       Is this how the 1988 Trade Bill was supposed to improve the \n     ability of American firms to engage in foreign trade? Hard-\n     metric conversion would work a trade burden on the domestic \n     C/M industry, not a trade benefit. It would seem that this \n     was exactly the unintended consequence that Congress sought \n     to avoid in the 1988 Trade Bill.\n       Aside from the tremendous burdens it would place on the C/M \n     industry, there would be increased construction costs to \n     produce what amounts to a specialty product. I mentioned \n     previously that there would be no way for a small block \n     manufacturer to recoup its costs. Actually, there would be a \n     way--by passing those additional costs on to the consumer, \n     which in this case is the taxpayer. I understand that federal \n     contracting agents are willing under the metrication policy \n     to accept higher bids in order to obtain hard-metric \n     product--a ``metric premium'' in the range of 1 to 5 \n     percent. They have to because hard-metric product is often \n     in very short supply or non-existent.\n       It gets worse. There are rumors that this metric premium \n     may quietly but quickly get out of hand. During a June \n     hearing before the House Science Subcommittee on Technology, \n     chaired by the Honorable Connie Morella, Mrs. Morella told \n     one of the witnesses that she had heard that a new advanced \n     technology laboratory being constructed at NIST near \n     Gaithersburg, Maryland is being built to hard metric \n     specifications, and that GAO estimates the additional cost \n     will be 20 or 25 percent. The witnesses did not deny that \n     this was the case.\n       Just how serious is the issue of reduced competition for \n     bids? NCMA recently sent a metrication questionnaire to the \n     798 C/M producers it knows to exist throughout the country. \n     398 responded, an astonishing response rate of 49 percent, \n     which gives some idea of how important this issue is to the \n     individual companies. Of those companies responding, I said \n     it currently makes hard-metric block, 397 said they do not. \n     Only two companies said they have hard-metric molds onsite to \n     make the product. It is likely there are others who can make \n     the product, but it is very clear that there is precious \n     little availability of the product the government is asking \n     for in the country today, and little capacity to make it.\n       Recently, I was contacted by a contracting agent for the \n     Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta. He had a big hard-\n     metrication problem of his own. It seems he had made calls to \n     32 block manufacturers to determine availability of concrete \n     masonry. All 32 said they could provide all the block the CDC \n     would need, and at competitive prices. But when the CDC agent \n     asked whether the companies could supply hard-metric block, \n     immediately all but 6 of the companies dropped out. Of the \n     remaining six, 3 said they could provide soft-metric block. \n     The last 3 companies indicated they might do whatever it \n     takes to win the bid, but the agent believed that none of \n     those companies presently have hard metric capability.\n       Clearly, the taxpayers will pay more per unit, enjoy less \n     competition and have far fewer sources of product than can be \n     had using a soft-metric conversion. Indeed, federal \n     procurement policy staff have told me their design staff are \n     currently designing projects in hard-metric block even though \n     they have no idea where they will obtain the hard-metric \n     material. It is entirely possible that there will be no \n     responsive bidders in hard-metric, requiring the government \n     to redraw plans and bid in soft-metric, all at increased \n     costs to the taxpayers.\n       NCMA has gone to great lengths to persuade the federal \n     contracting authorities on the basis of these considerations \n     to relent on the hard-metric concrete block requirements.\n       We have thoroughly briefed the Construction Metrication \n     Council on the problems we would face. We have provided \n     position papers and fact sheets. We have met in small groups \n     with the federal employees charged with developing agency \n     procurement policy. We have invited CMC staff to speak \n     directly with C/M producers. We have told federal \n     construction representatives that there is only a relative \n     handful of C/M producers in America that can produce hard-\n     metric material. We have pleaded with CMC officials to \n     reconsider the caveat language in the 1988 Trade Bill clearly \n     showing that metrication is not meant to cause substantial \n     inefficiencies and loss of markets to U.S. firms, but \n\n[[Page S 16473]]\n\n     our entreaties have fallen upon deaf ears. The end result is \n     that we have had cordial, business-like meetings but the \n     drive for hard-metric concrete block continues unabated. The \n     federal procurement policy officials keep telling block \n     manufacturers to make hard-metric block or they won't be \n     adequately responding to federal solicitations.\n       We have been told point-blank that if companies have to go \n     by the wayside in order to convert to hard-metric, so be it, \n     that is the price of progress.\n       It is clear to me that the only solution at this point is a \n     legislative solution.\n       On behalf of united C/M producers throughout the country, I \n     would urge that you and your colleagues pass legislation to \n     restore the original intent of Congress and prevent the \n     terrible, ironic consequences that the hard-metric conversion \n     of concrete masonry would create.\n       With best wishes.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 Randall G. Pence,\n                                 Director of Government Relations.\n\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/11/01/senate-section/article/S16470-2", "month": "11", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "01", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S16473-S16491]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n      FOREIGN OPERATIONS, EXPORT FINANCING, AND RELATED PROGRAMS \n    APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 1996 MIDDLE EAST FACILITATION ACT OF 1995--\n                           CONFERENCE REPORT\n\n  The Senate continued with the consideration of the conference report.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, we have before the Senate this morning \nthe conference report on the foreign operations bill. This measure \npassed the House yesterday at 351 to 71.\n  I might just say before what I hope will be just a brief debate, I am \nnot currently aware of any other Senators on this side of the aisle who \nwish to speak. Senator Leahy should be here momentarily and it is our \nhope that we could have fairly early on here a rollcall vote on the \nconference report itself.\n  There is an amendment in disagreement related to the abortion issue \nwhich may take a little more debate and then a vote a little bit later. \nBut it is our hope, and if there are no objections or problems with \nthat, that we might be able to get to a vote on the conference report \nrather soon.\n  Let me say, although we had very limited resources, I believe this \nbill legislates our national priorities--it provides both security and \nflexibility.\n  The conferees produced legislation below our allocation, $1.5 billion \nbelow last year's levels and nearly $2.7 billion below what President \nClinton requested. So clearly we have made a reduction in foreign \nassistance.\n  In spite of these reductions, our security interests have been \nclearly served by earmarking funds for our Camp David partners and \nextending the Middle East Peace Facilitation Act.\n  We also advance our national security priorities in the New \nIndependent States by completing a shift in resources from Russia to \nUkraine, Armenia, Georgia, and the other States that used to be part of \nthe Soviet Union.\n  We have also linked aid to Russia to termination of the nuclear deal \nwith Iran. In the interest of maximizing the administration's leverage, \nI suggested the restriction take effect 3 months after the date of \nenactment of this bill giving the Vice President the opportunity to \nnegotiate a solution to this problem in his January meetings with \nChernomydin.\n  We have served U.S. interests while affording the administration a \ngreat deal of flexibility.\n  There are three ways we have offered flexibility.\n  First, we have provided transfer authority between accounts. For \nexample, NIS resources can be used to fund the Warsaw Initiative and \nPartnership for Peace programs. Second, we have consolidated various \ndevelopment aid accounts into one account with limited conditions; and, \nthird, there are very few earmarks.\n  I think the House would have preferred to provide a blank check \ngiving the administration the option to make all funding choices, but \nafter 3 years of unfulfilled commitments, the conferees agreed upon the \nnecessity to set funding levels for specific countries, which was, of \ncourse, the imprint of the Senate bill.\n  For my colleagues who are concerned about earmarking resources for \nspecific projects, let me assure them we have avoided such action. We \nhave funded countries and categories of activities such as programs to \nstrengthen democracy, rule of law and independent media, but have not \ndedicated any resources for any organization or project within these \nbroad accounts.\n  The conference report largely reflects the priorities identified by \nthe Senate. The conferees agreed to the Senate's provisions on a range \nof issues from Pakistan to an amendment offered by Senator Helms to ban \nAID's move to the Federal triangle.\n  One of the few items where the Senate position did not prevail \nconcerns Mexico City and funding for abortion. We are reporting back an \namendment in disagreement which I would like to take a moment to \nexplain.\n  The House passed language which banned assistance to any organization \nwhich fails to certify that they are not performing abortions. In \naddition, the House banned assistance to the UNFPA unless the President \ncertified programs in China had been terminated.\n  The Senate stripped out the language at the subcommittee level and \nsubstituted language requiring the same standards for determining \neligibility for assistance be applied to both governments and to \nnongovernmental and multilateral organizations. The senate also \nrequired no funds be used to lobby on the question of abortion.\n  Unfortunately the conferees were unable to reach any agreement on \nthis matter.\n  Fundamentally, let me just say that the Senate appears to be narrowly \nprochoice, as these terms generally describe positions Senators have \ntaken. The House appears to be prolife. So we were unable to come \ntogether in the conference report.\n  The House has sent over a substitute measure which restricts \nassistance to organizations which provide abortions but makes \nexceptions where the life of the mother, rape or incest are involved--a \nsolution which tracks the so-called Hyde standards. The compromise also \nincludes language which requires the President to certify that the \nUNFPA will terminate programs in China compared with the previous \nlanguage requiring the President to certify that UNFPA already has \nterminated China programs. My understanding is this distinction was \ndrawn because UNFPA plans to cease China programs at the end of this \ncalendar year, thus it is a standard the administration could meet.\n  I hope my colleagues will support the conference report as it is \nentirely consistent with the votes and views of the Senate expressed \nSeptember 21. It is my intention to also support the compromise \nlanguage proposed by the House in the amendment in disagreement since I \nbelieve it is consistent with language which the Congress has been able \nto support in the past. But, clearly, Mr. President, it is a statement \nof the obvious to say that is an issue upon which the Senate and the \nHouse are deeply divided.\n\n  With regard to the abortion issue, the vote, I would just report to \nmy colleagues--I think I said earlier the vote on the full conference \nreport in the House yesterday was 351 in favor, 71 against. On the \nabortion amendment in disagreement, in the House the vote was 231 in \nfavor of the House position, which I have just outlined; 187 against.\n  So, at some point during the day we will have a vote on the \nconference report and then a vote on the amendment in disagreement. It \nis my hope, as I indicated earlier, that we can have a vote on the \nconference report sometime very soon. I believe Senator Leahy is on his \nway and I did want to give notice to everyone there could well be a \nrollcall vote on the conference report sometime very soon.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I am grateful that the conferees have \nincluded my amendment to require the U.S. Agency for International \nDevelopment to contract out mapping and surveying work to qualified \nU.S. companies when such work can be accomplished by the private \nsector. This provision was based on my concern that while AID requires \nmapping and surveying in countries that receive development assistance, \nthis mapping and \n\n[[Page S 16474]]\n\nsurveying work is most often contracted out by AID to other government \nagencies. In many instances Federal agencies are aggressively marketing \ntheir mapping capabilities to foreign governments, and through AID, in \ndirect competition with qualified U.S. companies. Despite language in \nprevious committee reports, the amount of U.S. private sector \ncontracting for such services has not increased.\n  The purpose of this amendment is to move the mapping and surveying \nrequirements of AID to private U.S. firms. Under current Federal policy \non such commercial activities, if an activity has not been justified by \nthe provider agency--like the U.S. Geological Survey--for continued in-\nhouse performance, AID shall obtain the required services directly from \na commercial source. No agency has performed the requisite commercial \nactivities study to justify in-house performance in mapping and \nsurveying, so this provision is a clarification to enforce the existing \npolicy of the Federal Government to rely on, and not compete with, the \nprivate sector pursuant to the Office of Management and Budget circular \nA-76.\n  I would like to clarify one point with regard to the intent of this \nprovision, and to ask my good friend from Kentucky and the Foreign \nOperations Subcommittee chairman, Senator McConnell, if this is his \nunderstanding of this AID mapping and surveying amendment language? \nSpecifically, it is not the intent of this provision to change Federal \nprocurement law or the Federal Acquisition Regulations. Although the \nlanguage in the amendment uses the word ``bidding,'' contracts for \nmapping and surveying services should be awarded to qualified U.S. \nfirms in accordance with the standard and accepted procedure for such \nservices found in 40 U.S.C. 541 et seq. and section 36.601-4(a)(4) of \nthe Federal Acquisition Regulations. This amendment provides for \nincreased contracting out of mapping and surveying services by AID, \nusing the normal qualifications based selection process. Does the \nSenator from Kentucky concur with this clarification?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Senator Stevens, thank you for defining this wording \nof the AID mapping and surveying amendment, and, yes, I concur in this \nclarification.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I think the Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Campbell). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The Senator from Vermont is recognized.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, we have before us, as the distinguished \nchairman of the subcommittee has said, the foreign operations \nconference report. It is not the conference report I would have liked \nto have written as a bill. I suspect it is probably not precisely the \nconference report that the Senator from Kentucky would have liked to \nhave written. It is, however, the best that we could do in not only a \nvery difficult budget climate but one in which there are probably more \ntugs and pulls, philosophical, ideological, and policy, on the \nCommittee on Foreign Operations than I have seen in many a year.\n  The bill, incidentally, is $130 million below the level that was \npassed overwhelmingly, by a 5-to-1 margin, in the Senate on September \n21. I wish in this case we could have maintained the Senate level \nbecause it is a very small price to pay for American leadership abroad. \nWe find we can easily spend billions and billions of dollars going in \neither as peacekeeping forces or military forces when there are \ntroubles abroad, but we cannot spend a tiny, tiny fraction of that to \nhelp avoid those troubles beginning in the first place.\n  I do wish to commend Senator McConnell for his efforts to get this \nbill through the conference and to the President's desk. We had a very \nlengthy meeting. I think we went to about midnight or so on our \ncommittee of conference ironing out all but the one issue, the issue \nthat is before this body in true disagreement, and in fact in this case \nthat is on international family planning. I will have an amendment to \nreinstate the Senate position. I will do that for myself and for \nSenator Kassebaum and for others, and to go back to the Senate \nposition. I will do that after we pass the conference report, which I \nfully expect will be passed.\n  That amendment, which I will then offer, will simply reaffirm what \nthe Senate is already on record doing. In fact, the President has made \nit very clear that he will veto this bill unless we fix this one \nprovision, the item that is in disagreement.\n  So in this case we did the best we could. I feel that we are not \nmeeting many of our international commitments, and I would just close \nwith this thought. We all take great joy at seeing the cold war ending. \nEvery one of us, if we travel abroad, like saying we are Americans, \nwithout saying it here at home. The fact is we are the most powerful \nnation history has ever known. We are the largest economy history has \never known. But with that comes certain responsibilities. Frankly, we \nhave backed off on these responsibilities worldwide. Other countries \nhave picked up on them.\n  Japan spends not only as part of their budget but more in actual \ndollars in areas of foreign aid than we do. That is not all done out of \naltruism. They have found that as they have helped the economies of a \nnumber of developing countries, these developing countries then buy \ngoods from Japan; their exports go up while our exports are going down. \nThey create more jobs in Japan while we lose jobs in America. Why? \nBecause they are willing to invest in the future economies of some of \nthese countries. We do not want to invest the pennies in the future \neconomies of some of these countries even though it creates dollars and \ndollars and dollars here in the United States. We do not want to spend \nthe pennies to create some of the jobs and the economic benefits in \nsome of these developing countries even though we will create far more \njobs in the United States, even though all of us know that as exports \ngo up it is one of the single greatest boons to our economy here in the \nUnited States.\n  Instead, we let this export business go to other countries. We let \nthese jobs go to other countries. We do not show that kind of \nleadership.\n  We are not doing enough to stop wars and internal struggles worldwide \neven though we know that we will get sucked into them eventually and \nspend a heck of a lot more after the fact. It is kind of like \npreventive medicine. We do not want to spend the money on preventive \nmedicine but, by gosh, we come in with troops to take care of the costs \nin the emergency room afterward. Well, there are going to be a lot of \nemergency rooms worldwide, and the most powerful nation on Earth is \ngoing to be called upon. Maybe we ought to start doing a little \npreventive medicine. It is going to cost us a lot less in the long run. \nIt is going to be far more important to our national security, and it \nis going to improve our own economy.\n  With that, Mr. President, I would ask for the regular order.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, the Senate is now considering the \nconference report accompanying H.R. 1868, the foreign operations and \nexport financing appropriations bill for fiscal year 1996.\n  The final bill provides $12.1 billion in budget authority and $5.9 \nbillion in new outlays to finance the Nation's foreign assistance \nprograms.\n  When outlays from prior-year budget authority and other completed \nactions are taken into account, the bill totals $12.2 billion in budget \nauthority and $13.9 billion in outlays for fiscal year 1996.\n  The subcommittee is within its section 602(b) allocation for both \nbudget authority and outlays. The bill is $84.4 million in budget \nauthority under the subcommittee 602(b) allocation and at the outlay \nallocation.\n  I commend the conferees for supporting the North American Development \nBank in the final bill.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a table displaying the \nbudget \n\n[[Page S 16475]]\n\ncommittee scoring of the final bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the table was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n   FOREIGN OPERATIONS SUBCOMMITTEE SPENDING TOTALS--CONFERENCE REPORT   \n               [Fiscal year 1996, in millions of dollars]               \n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                   Budget               \n                                                 authority     Outlays  \n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nNondefense discretionary:                                               \n  Outlays from prior-year BA and other actions                          \n   completed..................................           68        7,950\n  H.R. 1868, conference report................       12,060        5,892\n  Scorekeeping adjustment.....................  ...........  ...........\n                                               -------------------------\n      Subtotal nondefense discretionary.......       12,128       13,842\n                                               =========================\nMandatory:                                                              \n  Outlays from prior-year BA and other actions                          \n   completed..................................  ...........  ...........\n  H.R. 1868, conference report................           44           44\n  Adjustment to conform mandatory programs                              \n   with Budget Resolution assumptions.........            0            0\n                                               -------------------------\n      Subtotal mandatory......................           44           44\n                                               =========================\n      Adjusted bill total.....................       12,172       13,886\nSenate Subcommittee 602(b) allocation:                                  \n  Defense discretionary.......................  ...........  ...........\n  Nondefense discretionary....................       12,212       13,842\n  Violent crime reduction trust fund..........  ...........  ...........\n  Mandatory...................................           44           44\n                                               -------------------------\n      Total allocation........................       12,256       13,886\n                                               =========================\nAdjusted bill total compared to Senate                                  \n Subcommittee 602(b) allocation:                                        \n  Defense discretionary.......................  ...........  ...........\n  Nondefense discretionary....................          -84           -0\n  Violent crime reduction trust fund..........  ...........  ...........\n  Mandatory...................................  ...........  ...........\n                                               -------------------------\n      Total allocation........................          -84           -0\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nNote.--Details may not add to totals due to rounding.

Mr. President, I intend to vote for passage of the \nconference report to H.R. 1868, the foreign operations appropriations \nbill. I do so because there are a number of vitally important \nprovisions in this legislation, chief among them being the extension of \nthe Middle East Peace Facilitation Act. I share the concerns of many of \nmy colleagues regarding Palestinian compliance with the peace accords, \nand will continue to follow this issue with great interest. With this \nbill, the American taxpayer once again is investing in what all hope to \nbe a historic and lasting peace in the Middle East. It is up to us here \nin Congress to be sure that it is a wise investment, and that the \nconditions that brought about it are met.\n  I must confess I will vote in favor of this bill with great \nreluctance. I am very disappointed that the House and Senate conferees \nagreed to keep in the bill Senate language that would repeal a portion \nof Federal law that prohibits United States aid to Pakistan as long as \nthe President fails to certify that Pakistan is not in possession of a \nnuclear explosive device--a law otherwise known as the Pressler \namendment. The provision in H.R. 1868 would allow nonmilitary aid to \nresume to Pakistan, and would authorize the President to transfer $370 \nmillion in military equipment sought by Pakistan but not delivered \nbecause of the Pressler sanctions. By including this provision, this \nCongress has put the American taxpayer back in the business of \nsubsidizing a nuclear program that this Nation does not recognize under \nthe Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty [NNPT]. Even worse, today the U.S. \nCongress has sent a chilling message: Nuclear proliferation pays.\n  This is a frustrating day, Mr. President. Ten years ago, the U.S. \nCongress passed the Pressler amendment. In so doing, we made it clear \nthat the United States could not condone, through foreign aid, \nPakistan's drive for the bomb. It was our hope that the leverage of \nforeign aid would deter Pakistan from developing nuclear weapons. If it \ndid not, it was important from the standpoint of nonproliferation that \nthe United States not subsidize Pakistan's nuclear program. That was \nthe purpose behind the Pressler amendment.\n  By and large, the Pressler amendment has worked. First, though never \nverified, Pakistan claims it has ceased developing weapons grade \nenriched uranium. Second, the threat of Pressler sanctions has deterred \na number of states that pursued active nuclear weapons research \nprograms in the 1980's, including Argentina, Brazil, South Korea, \nTaiwan, and South Africa. This successful track record now risks being \nreversed.\n  I have expressed my strong concerns on this issue in this Chamber \nalready in great detail. I will not repeat them here. The bottom line \nis clear: Our Nation's nonproliferation policy is in serious jeopardy, \nand it is not just with respect to the Pressler amendment. We have \nheard many reports that the communist Chinese have shipped M-11 related \nmissile technology to both Pakistan and Iran in violation of the \nMissile Technology Control Regime. Under a law I drafted, the President \nhas presumptive authority to impose sanctions against the responsible \nparties in China if he has reason to believe an MTCR violation has \noccurred. Yet, the President is unwilling to exercise that authority. \nFurther, the current House and Senate versions of the intelligence \nauthorization bill contain language that would give the President \nunprecedented discretion to waive U.S. nonproliferation laws.\n  Mr. President, just last year, the President stated that no foreign \npolicy issue was more important to the security of all people than \nnuclear nonproliferation. Yet, the current administration is \nengineering an unprecedented rollback in U.S. nonproliferation laws and \npolicies. The administration's actions do not match its rhetoric. This \ndemonstration of double- think would be very humorous if the issue was \nnot so very serious.\n  For those of us in Congress who have devoted many years on \nnonproliferation issues, these recent developments are very disturbing. \nAs the world's sole remaining superpower, the signatories of the NNPT \nlook to us to set the example and enforce the rules. Yet, today, we are \nchanging the rules of the nuclear nonproliferation game to benefit one \nproliferator. This is the worst possible message we could send to those \nnations who have played by the rules.\n\n\n                           PAKISTAN PROVISION\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise in support of the Foreign \nOperations Conference Report, but I do so with regret because of the \nprovision in this bill relating to Pakistan.\n  There is much in this conference report that I support, and which I \nbelieve the conferees have every right to be proud of.\n  The bill maintains our assistance to Israel and Egypt, sending a \nmessage of the United States' firm support of our allies in the Middle \nEast, and our encouragement of their efforts to achieve a comprehensive \npeace.\n  The bill extends the Middle East Peace Facilitation Act by 18 months, \nallowing the President to continue to provide assistance to the \nPalestinians and conduct relations with the PLO, while requiring strict \ncompliance by the PLO and the Palestinian Authority with all of their \ncommitments. This is a further demonstration of U.S. support for the \npeace process.\n  The bill provides assistance for Armenia, Ukraine, and other former \nSoviet republics to help ensure that democracy takes hold, and the \nassistance to Russia is appropriately conditioned on Russian \ncooperation with the United States in various areas.\n  The bill significantly increases the budget for international \nnarcotics programs, demonstrating that controlling the scourge of the \ninternational drug trade is among our Nation's highest international \npriorities.\n  Unfortunately, included in the conference report with all these \npositive provisions is a provision that I think is extremely dangerous. \nThe House conferees agreed to adopt the Senate language on Pakistan, \nwhich was added to the bill as a Brown amendment. Among other things, \nthis provision allows the President to transfer to Pakistan some $368 \nmillion worth of sophisticated military equipment at a time when \nPakistan is still committed to pursuing weapons of mass destruction.\n  I realize that we have debated this issue at length, but the \nobjections to this provision bear repeating.\n  Sanctions were invoked against Pakistan in 1990 because President \nBush could not certify that Pakistan did not possess a nuclear \nexplosive device. Nothing has changed since that time. To this day, \nneither President Bush nor President Clinton has been able to make such \na certification.\n  Pakistan's commitment to continuing its nuclear program makes it \nwholly inappropriate--even irresponsible--for the Congress to authorize \nthe release to Pakistan of a significant package of sophisticated \nmilitary equipment.\n  I realize that this provision has the support of the administration, \nbut I must say that in advocating this proposal, the administration is \nalso acting irresponsibly. An administration that says that \nnonproliferation is one of its \n\n[[Page S 16476]]\n\nhighest international priorities should not be transferring weapons to \nPakistan until Pakistan has made vast improvements on the \nnonproliferation front.\n  There is a further concern about transferring these weapons. The \npackage of equipment may not be significant enough to substantially \nalter the military balance in the region, but it is enough to \nexacerbate an unstable political situation. The political symbolism of \nthe returning equipment will be handing a propaganda victory to the \nextremist Indian opposition heading in next spring's elections.\n   The Indian Government is already coming under intense domestic \npressure to respond to the transfer of these weapons. I very much fear \nthat India will respond by deploying their Prithvi missile, which could \nlaunch a bona fide ballistic missile race in South Asia. Pakistan might \nwell respond by deploying the M-11s many believe they have acquired \nfrom China.\n  If this scenario plays itself out, the United States will be \nresponsible for fueling an extremely dangerous arms race in one of the \nmost unstable regions in the world.\n  Having said all this, I want to make two additional points. First, I \nwant to urge the government and people of India not to overreact to \nthis turn of events.\n  Indian politicians may exploit these weapons for their own gain and \nstoke the flames of paranoia in the pursuit of votes. But I want to \nurge the Government of India not to respond to this weapons transfer by \nsignificantly upgrading their military posture, and in particular, not \nto further escalate the arms race in South Asia.\n  Second, if we must transfer these weapons to Pakistan, we are \nentitled to expect something in return. As I have said in the past, I \nfavor resuming nonmilitary assistance to Pakistan in order to expand \nour ability to cooperate on anti-terrorism activities, anti-narcotics \nefforts, peacekeeping, environmental protection, and other areas. I \nconsider those provisions of the Brown amendment to be helpful in \nenabling us to rebuild our troubled relationship with Pakistan.\n  But we have every right to expect improved cooperation from Pakistan, \nnot only in these areas, but in nonproliferation as well. Pakistan's \nunfortunate record of developing nuclear weapons and seeking to acquire \nballistic missile technology has exacerbated tensions and contributed \nto instability in South Asia. As we have in the past, I would urge \nPakistan to reverse course and contribute to building a new, more \nstable South Asia.\n  Mr. President, I believe we have made a mistake with the passage of \nthe entire Brown amendment. With the help of both India and Pakistan, \nwe can help ensure that this mistake does not spawn other, even greater \nmistakes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate on the conference \nreport? If not, the question is on agreeing to the conference report. \nThe yeas and nays have been ordered.

The question before the Senate is the \namendment in disagreement, which the clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       Resolved, That the House recede from its disagreement to \n     the amendment of the Senate numbered 115 to the aforesaid \n     bill, and concur therein with an amendment as follows:\n       In lieu of the matter proposed by said amendment, insert:\n     : Provided, That none of the funds available under this Act \n     may be used to lobby for or against abortion.\n\n\n                  prohibition on funding for abortion\n\n       Sec. 518A. (a) In General.--(1) Notwithstanding any other \n     provision of this Act or other law, none of the funds \n     appropriated by this Act for population assistance activities \n     may be made available for any foreign private, \n     nongovernmental, or multilateral organization until the \n     organization certifies that it will not during the period for \n     which the funds are made available, perform abortions in any \n     foreign country, except where the life of the mother would \n     be endangered if the fetus were carried to term or in \n     cases of forcible rape or incest.\n       (2) Paragraph (1) may not be construed to apply to the \n     treatment of injuries or illnesses caused by legal or illegal \n     abortions or to assistance provided directly to the \n     government of a country.\n       (b) Lobbying Activities.--(1) Notwithstanding any other \n     provision of this Act or other law, none of the funds \n     appropriated by this Act for population assistance activities \n     may be made available for any foreign private, \n     nongovernmental, or multilateral organization until the \n     organization certifies that it will not during the period for \n     which the funds are made available, violate the laws of any \n     foreign country concerning the circumstances under which \n     abortion is permitted, regulated, or prohibited.\n       (2) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Act, \n     paragraph (1) shall not apply to activities in opposition to \n     coercive abortion or involuntary sterilization.\n       (c) Subsections (a) and (b) apply to funds made available \n     for a foreign organization either directly or as a \n     subcontractor or sub-grantee, and the required certifications \n     apply to activities in which the organization engages either \n     directly or through a subcontractor or sub-grantee.\n       (d) Coercive Population Control Methods.--Notwithstanding \n     any other provision of this Act or other law, none of the \n     funds appropriated by this Act may be made available for the \n     United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA), unless the President \n     certifies to the appropriate congressional committees that \n     (1) the United Nations Population Fund will terminate all \n     family planning activities in the People's Republic of China \n     no later than March 1, 1996; or (2) during the 12 months \n     preceding such certification, there have been no abortions as \n     the result of coercion associated with the family planning \n     policies of the national government or other governmental \n     entities within the People's Republic of China. As used in \n     this section the term ``coercion'' includes physical duress \n     or abuse, destruction or confiscation of property, loss of \n     means of livelihood, or severe psychological pressure.\n\n\n                           AMENDMENT NO. 3041\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I move to concur in the House amendment \nwith an amendment that I send to the desk on behalf of myself and the \nSenator from Kansas [Mrs. Kassebaum].\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Vermont [Mr. Leahy], for himself and Mrs. \n     Kassebaum, proposes an amendment numbered 3041 to the \n     amendment of the House to the amendment of the Senate No. \n     115.\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       In lieu of the matter proposed, insert the following: ``: \n     Provided, That in determining eligibility for assistance from \n     funds appropriated to carry out section 104 of the Foreign \n     Assistance Act of 1961, nongovernmental and multilateral \n     organizations shall not be subjected to requirements more \n     restrictive than the requirements applicable to \n\n[[Page S 16477]]\n\n     foreign governments for such assistance: Provided further, \n     That none of the funds made available under this Act may be \n     used to lobby for or against abortion.''\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. I will yield to the Senator from Arizona in a moment. Just \nso that colleagues will understand what is happening here, the \namendment that the Senator from Kansas [Mrs. Kassebaum] and I have sent \nto the desk is an amendment on the one amendment in disagreement. We \nresolved 192 out of the 193 amendments in the committee of conference. \nThis is the one so-called Mexico City policy of the 1980's, one in \ndisagreement.\n  After having been reported, it is open to second-degree amendment, \nwhich I understand the Senator from Arizona is going to make on an \nentirely different issue. But for those who have been asking me about \nthe Mexico City policy, my understanding is what we would then do is \ndebate the amendment of the Senator from Arizona, there would be a vote \non that, and then we would begin the debate on the Mexico City \namendment.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 3042 to Amendment No. 3041\n\n(Purpose: To permit the continued provision of assistance to Burma only \n                  if certain conditions are satisfied)\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. I have a second degree perfecting amendment, which I send \nto the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Arizona [Mr. McCain], for himself and Mr. \n     Kerry, proposes an amendment numbered 3042 to amendment No. \n     3041.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n       At the end of the pending amendment add the following:\n       Sec.   . Notwithstanding any other provision of this Act, \n     funds made available in this Act may be used for \n     international narcotics control assistance under chapter 8 of \n     part I of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961, or crop \n     substitution assistance, directly for the Government of Burma \n     if the Secretary of State certifies to the appropriate \n     congressional committees that any such programs are fully \n     consistent with United States human rights concerns in Burma \n     and serve a vital United States national interest. The \n     President shall include in each annual International \n     Narcotics Control Strategy Report submitted under section \n     489(a) of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 (22 U.S.C. \n     2291h(a)) a description of the programs funded under this \n     section.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I have discussed this amendment with the \ndistinguished Senator from Kentucky, the manager of the bill, and with \nthe Senator from Vermont. I do not believe this should take very much \ntime.\n  I ask for the yeas and nays on this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, this amendment would modify the provision \nin the conference report that prohibits funding for international \nnarcotics control assistance in Burma. The amendment would modify that \nprohibition by permitting such assistance only if the Secretary of \nState certifies to Congress that such programs are fully consistent \nwith the United States human rights concerns in Burma, and that they \nserve a vital United States national interest.\n  I emphasize that the secretary must certify that a program such as \nthis serves a vital U.S. national security interest.\n  That vital national interest is obvious, Mr. President. Sixty percent \nof the heroin that comes to this country originates in Burma--60 \npercent. We have a compelling, urgent responsibility to do whatever we \ncan to eliminate or at least reduce Burma's export of that dangerous \nnarcotic. Without a strategy that addresses the heroin trade in Burma, \nwe have no effective antinarcotic program at all.\n  I can well understand the Senate's desire to influence the Burmese \nregime's treatment of the Burmese people. That treatment has been \nabominable and well deserves our severe reproach. I visited Burma last \nMarch and was exposed to a pretty representative sampling of how \nabominable that treatment has been and continues to be.\n  Daw Aung San Kyi's release was a very welcome development. But in and \nof itself it does not represent evidence of political reform or even an \nindication of progress toward an objective standard of human rights in \nBurma. Burma has a very long way to go.\n  I feel very strongly that the United States must actively support the \ncause of human freedom in Burma, and make it unmistakably clear to \nBurma's State Law and Order Restoration Council, the SLORC, that the \nUnited States, indeed, all of the civilized world expect them to begin \nrespecting the will and the rights of the Burmese people.\n  But what I have difficulty understanding is why we must refrain from \nacting in our own national interest while we attempt to act in the \ninterest of the Burmese people. I could understand the objective of \nthis provision if it stated that no funds for drug control could be \nmade available directly to the SLORC. I would not support this \nassistance either if the State Department were proposing to simply \nprovide money to the SLORC with the promise that the SLORC would use it \nto eradicate poppy fields. It is quite probable that such funds would \nbe used by the SLORC to further oppress ethnic minorities in Burma, \nlike the Wa.\n  But, Mr. President, that is not what the administration proposes to \ndo with this assistance. First, it is a relatively small amount of \nmoney that we are talking about, with most of it going to the efforts \nof the United Nations Drug Control Program [UNDCP] in Burma. Two \nmillion dollars would be provided to the U.N. to work with ethnic \nminorities on crop substitution and other programs intended to begin \nmaking some, although admittedly small, progress in reducing poppy \ncultivation. None of that assistance would be funneled through the \nSLORC.\n  A limited--a very limited amount of assistance, $50,000, I believe--\nwould be provided to train Burmese customs officials. But I fail to see \nthe harm in that, given that the amount is so small, and the need for \nbetter Burmese control of drug smuggling at the borders so obvious.\n  Mr. President, $2 million isn't going to solve America's heroin \nproblem. But I do not see how we begin to get any control over that \nproblem absent some kind of program in Burma.\n  Opium production in Burma has skyrocketed in recent years. It is, by \nfar, the largest heroin producing country in the world. Again, 60 \npercent of heroin in the United States originates in Burma.\n  The enormous increase in heroin production globally has substantially \nreduced the street price of heroin while simultaneously increasing the \npurity, and, consequently, the lethality of the drug. Overdoses--fatal \noverdoses--have increased rapidly in the United States.\n  Sadly, as long as there is demand for heroin, we will never be able \nto keep it out of all our children's hands. But if in Burma and \nelsewhere our efforts make some progress in restricting the flow of \nheroin to the United States, we will make the drug more expensive and \nless readily available on our streets that it is today.\n  Mr. President, before I conclude, I should also add that in meetings \nattended by American Embassy officials in Rangoon, Daw Aung San Suu \nKyi, the Nobel Prize winner, clearly the leader of that nation, who has \nbeen a beacon of hope for freedom and democracy for the people of Burma \nand people of the world, whose stature is such that she was awarded the \nNobel Peace Prize, and she, Daw Aung San Suu Kyi, expressed her support \nfor counter-narcotics assistance to Burma. In fact, she maintained such \nassistance would not directly or indirectly help the SLORC to retain \npower and, on the contrary, might encourage the SLORC to make \nadditional human rights concessions. For my part, her opinion should be \nwhat drives the decisions made here in the U.S. Senate. I think it is \nclearly sufficient justification to approve of this very modest \nantidrug program.\n  I am convinced that the counternarcotics assistance envisioned for \nBurma is consistent with our human rights goals in Burma. But I repeat, \nto ensure that it remains so, this amendment requires the Secretary to \ncertify that all the programs which our assistance would support are \nfully consistent with our human rights concerns in Burma.\n  Mr. President, I believe, as we have in many other countries, the \nUnited \n\n[[Page S 16478]]\n\nStates can advance its values and protect our national interests in \nBurma simultaneously. They are not mutually exclusive and should not be \ntreated so.\n  I understand the committee's motive for this provision. I must \ndisagree with the means by which it hopes to achieve its objective. I \nhope Senators also disagree with those means and support the amendment \nto help in some small way reduce the flow of heroin to the streets of \nAmerica.\n  Mr. President, this amendment is supported by the administration. \nThis amendment is supported by Daw Aung San Suu Kyi. I have no brief \nfor the ruling junta of army officers that control Burma--their human \nrights record is despicable. If any of this money were going to help \nthat organization, I would not be proposing it.\n  We started a war on drugs some years ago, and we have either declared \nunconditional surrender or we have forgotten about it. I do not know \nwhich. Whatever, there is an increase in the use of heroin in this \ncountry. There is an increase in the purity of that heroin. There are \nlethal overdoses that are being taken of that drug as we speak.\n  I believe that there are many ways to win the war on drugs. The \nprimary one is to reduce the demand here at home. We also must attack \nthe supply in whatever way we can.\n  I want to point out again, Mr. President, I probably would not have \nproposed this amendment if it had not been for the express support of \nthis program by this remarkable, extraordinary woman, a woman who \ntranscends human events, a woman who has suffered for her country, \nwhose father was a martyr to an assassin's bullet as he was the leader \nof this poor country. Mr. President, if the person who clearly, if \nthere were an election tomorrow, would win by an overwhelming majority, \na landslide, were not in support of this amendment, I would not be \nproposing it, and I hope that the Members of this body will heed her \nwords rather than anyone else's, including my own.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, in July, Suu Kyi was released after 6 \nyears under house arrest. It was the first glimmer of hope for Burma \nsince the military crackdown in 1988. As she has repeatedly and \nemphatically stated since her release, nothing else has happened. She \nhas been released and that is it. Burma is not one step closer to \nimplementing the results of the elections of 1990.\n  Burmese citizens are still suffering at the hands of one of the worst \npolice states in the world. In fact, since Suu Kyi was released, there \nhave been more arrests, more Burmese men, women, and children have been \nforced from their homes into concentration camps, more villages have \nbeen burned to the ground by the government troops.\n  In fact, a recent Amnesty International report asserted unequivocally \nthat the situation has dramatically deteriorated inside Burma in the \nlast 2 months. Let me be clear, the situation has gotten worse since \nSuu Kyi's release.\n  Yet this is the very government that the amendment of my good friend \nfrom Arizona would have us cooperate with. Reasonable people can differ \nabout how best to handle this situation, but I must say with all due \nrespect to my good friend from Arizona, I see it a little differently. \nA government guilty of arbitrary detentions, torture, forced \nrelocations, and killings is, it seems to me, a questionable government \nwith which to deal.\n  The Assistant Secretary of State for Asia, Win Lord, shares this \nview. When I asked him what were the major impediments to an effective \ncounternarcotics effort he said, ``What is gong to solve the problem \nover the long run is a popular, representative open government--all \nother efforts are minuscule compared to whether you have an open system \nthere.'' I could not agree more with Secretary Lord's statement. A \nmilitary junta, with an army of 350,000, assembled exclusively to \nterrorize its own people--they have no external threats, this army is \nto terrorize Burmese people--a military junta about which Assistant \nSecretary of State for Asian affairs, Winston Lord, has testified, \n``The only impediment to cooperation on narcotics is their lack of \ninterest.'' Their, meaning the SLORC.\n  Secretary Lord has testified we can only expect to see real \ncooperation on narcotics if democracy is restored. They had an election \nin 1990. The SLORC did not honor the election. Suu Kyi had been under \nhouse arrest since 1988, until this July. The situation has \ndeteriorated since then. The question I guess we have before us is \nwhether cooperation with this regime will produce a positive result. I \nam as concerned about the fact that 60 percent of the heroin coming \ninto this country is coming from Burma as anyone else. It seems to me \nreasonable people can differ as to how to approach this problem, but I \nthink we should be moving to isolate the military junta, rather than \npursuing the amendment of my good friend from Arizona. That is why we \nshould support the restoration of democracy and implement the results \nof the 1990 election.\n  Let me just conclude by noting that Suu Kyi has urged all nations to \nsuspend investment in Burma, to take all steps possible to isolate this \npariah regime. She opposes any efforts to legitimize this repressive \nregime.\n  My good friend from Arizona has argued that his amendment is not \nabout cooperating with SLORC, but that is precisely what the State \nDepartment budget materials recommend. That is what the State \nDepartment is in effect recommending here. So it seems to me that is \nexactly what the State Department has in mind. They are seeking funds \nto train SLORC in counternarcotics efforts.\n  My good friend from Arizona has indicated that he believes Suu Kyi \nsupports this cooperation. I know that is what the administration has \nrepresented as her position. The administration said Suu Kyi supports \nthis approach.\n  But I might point out to my colleagues, to members of the House \nInternational Relations Committee who met with her, and in interviews \nwith the international media, she has explicitly and repeatedly said \nshe does not support cooperation with SLORC.\n  In fact, when she was advised the assistance we have provided had \nbeen used to attack ethnic groups on the border, I was advised she was \nhorrified. It is the administration's interpretation of Suu Kyi's \nwishes that my colleague is relying upon, and I can understand his \nrelying on the administration, I suppose. But there is substantial \nevidence, it seems to this Senator, that the administration is not \ncorrectly relating Suu Kyi's position to us. They are incorrectly \ncharacterizing her position.\n  There are others, including the international press and members of \nthe House International Relations Committee, who have met with Suu Kyi \nand come to a different conclusion. So reasonable people here can \ndiffer.\n  I know my friend from Arizona's intentions are the best. He has been \nto Burma. He knows a lot about Southeast Asia. But it just seems to \nthis Senator that cooperation with SLORC is not in our best interests. \nIt seems to this Senator there are a number of people, both reporters \nand House Members, who have spoken with Suu Kyi who reached the \nconclusion that she would not favor this approach.\n  I simply hope the Senate will not go on record supporting the \namendment of the Senator from Arizona. The issue of Burma is not going \nto go away. He is extremely knowledgeable about Burma, has very strong \nopinions about Burma. There are others of us who are also interested in \nwhat we might be able to do to bring about the end of SLORC and the \nreturn of democracy.\n  I hope we could all kind of sit down together and, not using this \nparticular bill as a vehicle, sit down together and figure out what our \nbest approach to Burma ought to be. With all due respect to my friend \nfrom Arizona, it seems to me cooperation with SLORC on drugs would be \nlike cooperating with Iran on counterterrorism. It seems to me highly \nunlikely that this would be a productive relationship.\n  So I hope the amendment of the Senator from Arizona will not be \napproved. I will make a motion to table when we \n\n[[Page S 16479]]\n\nfinish our debate. I understand we are going to be finishing up pretty \nquickly.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont [Mr. Leahy] is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I, like the distinguished chairman, cannot \nsupport the amendment and will join in his motion to table, not because \nI disagree with the Senator from Arizona in wanting to stop the flow of \nheroin from Burma. I totally agree with him in wanting to do that. I \nacknowledge his expertise in that part of the world. Anybody who has \nwatched the evidence from the various law enforcement and international \nagencies knows of the tremendous flow of heroin from Burma. But I do \nnot think this would stop it. In fact, I believe it will be money \nbasically lost.\n  The SLORC itself is involved in the drug trade. They are an army that \nviolates the human rights of their own people. They oppress their own \npeople. They stop dissent in their own people. But, also, they take \ndrug money themselves.\n  A U.N. program is not going to make any measurable difference. We are \ndealing with an outlaw government. We should not be doing something \nthat might suggest that we accept this government in any way. These are \ndrug dealers and thugs. They themselves are profiting from something we \nwould be asking them to stop. So, while I will be happy to look at \nother areas when this bill next comes up, or any other bill, I will not \nsupport this.\n  I might also say I hope, having cleared 192 out of 193 amendments in \ndisagreement, that we might be able to send back to the other body just \none amendment in disagreement, something that will be debated and voted \non following the debate and vote on the amendment of the Senator from \nArizona.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona [Mr. McCain] is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, a cable sent back from the State \nDepartment, which I have a copy of, concerned a long interview that \ntook place with Aung San Suu Kyi on July 14 of this year. I quote:\n       Speaking to the Richardson-Rohrabacher amendment seeking to \n     bar any USG drug control assistance to Burma, Aung San Suu \n     Kyi disapproved, opining that, while the ``stick'' of \n     impending trade sanctions had been useful in prompting her \n     release, offering USG counternarcotics assistance to the \n     SLORC would be a useful ``carrot'' to encourage additional \n     progress.\n       The SLORC's desire to benefit from the political legitimacy \n     accompanying USG drug control aid is well known, pointed out \n     the NLD leader. She cited exchange of information and \n     training as two specific types of counternarcotics assistance \n     she could envision occurring now.\n\n  By the way, I ask unanimous consent the entire cable be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the cable was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord as follows:\n\n                Sanctions and Drug Control Aid Discussed\n\n\n         nld leader sees drug control aid as useful ``carrot''\n\n       11. Speaking to the Richardson-Rohrabacher amendment \n     seeking to bar any USG drug control assistance to Burma, Aung \n     San Suu Kyi disapproved, opining that, while the ``stick'' of \n     impending trade sanctions had been useful in prompting her \n     release, offering USG counternarcotics assistance to the \n     SLORC would be a useful ``carrot'' to encourage additional \n     progress.\n       The SLORC's desire to benefit from the political legitimacy \n     accompanying USG drug control aid is well known, pointed out \n     the NLD leader. She cited exchange of information and \n     training as two specific types of counternarcotics assistance \n     she could envision occurring now. While the SLORC would \n     appreciate this aid, it would not improve the regime's \n     staying power.\n       12. Berkowitz expressed concern that an exchange of \n     information on drug traffickers and operations with the \n     Burmese authorities might hurt the Wa, who are poor farmers \n     with no alternative other than poppy cultivation. Suu Kyi \n     clarified that the type of information she was taking about \n     would not be that which could be used to attack harmless \n     people. Rather, information on drug traffickers' movements \n     would assist Burmese officials in locating and interdicting \n     drug operations.\n       She turned to Tin 00, calling him an expert on the Wa, and \n     asked him for expanded views on this issue. Tin 00 noted that \n     poor Wa might be hurt, but added that the exchange of \n     information on areas of poppy cultivation would be good, \n     though the government may not take action against poppy \n     cultivation in ethnic areas even when provided precise \n     information on their location. Aung San Suu Kyi did not seem \n     unduly worried when Berkowitz raised, the possibility that \n     drug control efforts in the Wa area might alienate Wa farmers \n     who depend on drug production for their sustenance.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, unless misinformation--and perhaps it is--\nis being conveyed from our Embassy in Burma, I think it is pretty clear \nwhat Aung San Suu Kyi's position is on this issue.\n  Also, let me point out, as I did in my opening statement, I do not \nsupport any money going through the Burmese Government known as SLORC. \nThis money would not go through the Burmese Government known as SLORC. \nIt specifically would be provided to the United Nations to work with \nethnic minorities on crop substitution and other programs intended to \nbegin making some, although admittedly small, progress in reducing \npoppy cultivation. None of that assistance would be funneled through \nthe Government.\n  So I am sorry the Senator from Vermont either is misinformed or did \nnot pay attention to what I had to say; perhaps both.\n  But the fact is that this money would not--I repeat, not--go through \nthe settlement. If it would go through the Burmese Government, then I \nam convinced Aung San San Suu Kyi would not approve of it. After all, \nshe is the one spent 4 years under house arrest and was a martyr who \nwatched her countrymen be slaughtered by the same group of people. \nEverybody has their own opinion.\n  But let us not distort the facts here. The facts are that we have \ncredible evidence from a cable sent to the United States State \nDepartment which clearly indicates her support of certain types of drug \ncontrol programs. That is reality, and that is a fact.\n  The other fact that I think we ought to emphasize here is that the \nmoney would not go through the Burmese Government. And nobody--I mean \nnobody that I know of--would support funding through that government.\n  I would also suggest that perhaps the Senator from Vermont--Vermont \nis a little bit different from what it is in Arizona. Perhaps in \nVermont he does not have kids overdosing on drugs in the streets of the \ncapital of his State. Mr. President, I do. The Senator from Vermont \nsaid it will not do much good. Maybe it will not do much good. But I \nknow that people are dying in my home State from overdoses of heroin, \nfrom lethal doses of heroin that come directly from Burma, because it \nis a proven fact that 60 percent of the heroin that comes into the \nUnited States comes from Burma.\n  So, in all due respect to the Senator from Vermont and the people in \nhis State, it is a compelling, urgent, and terrible problem that we \nhave to take every possible step to cure. One of them would be to \nreduce the cultivation of this drug where it originates which does not \nrequire the participation of the Burmese Government.\n  Mr. President, it is a $2 million program we are talking about here. \nI am a bit curious why we should have to take up so much time of the \nSenate in a very large multibillion-dollar piece of legislation. But I \nwould be willing to vote on the motion of the Senator from Kentucky to \ntable whenever he feels that we should.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, by way of very brief response to my \nfriend from Arizona, the cable to which he referred was prepared a few \ndays after Suu Kyi's release back in July. She subsequently learned \nthat we provided information to SLORC on an alleged drug caravan which \nturned out to be used to attack ethnic groups on the border. Her views \n2 days after being totally isolated for 6 years has since been fully \ninformed by facts, which are that the money in all likelihood will end \nup with SLORC. She has since repeatedly opposed this cooperation, and \nin interviews, both with the press and with Congressmen who have been \nthere, believe that it may threaten Burmese citizens.\n  Again, let me say reasonable people can differ about this. I totally \nrespect my friend from Arizona and his interest in involvement in this \nissue. Fundamentally, it seems to me, the question is whether we should \nbe cooperating with the SLORC, one of the worst regimes in the world, \nif not the worst.\n\n[[Page S 16480]]\n\n  I think we have probably debated this amendment fully. I am not aware \nof anybody else who wishes to speak.\n  Mr. President, I move to table the McCain amendment, and I ask for \nthe yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Frist). Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Senator from Vermont.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3041\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, what is the pending business?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The motion of the Senator from Vermont to \nconcur in the House amendment with an amendment.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Thank you, Mr. President. Just so my colleagues \nunderstand, and I know there are a number of Senators on both sides who \nare going to want to speak, let me back up a bit.\n  First, the Senate has voted in favor of the conference report. The \nconference report reflected a conference that agreed on 192 out of 193 \namendments. Now we have the 1 remaining amendment of those 193 which is \nin true disagreement, and we have received from the other body their \nproposal.\n  I have moved to amend their amendment in disagreement with an \namendment by myself and the Senator from Kansas, Mrs. Kassebaum. What \nhappened is the Senate conferees were not able to agree to a House \nprovision that would reinstate the so-called Mexico City policy of the \n1980's. As Senators may recall, the Mexico City policy caused much \ndivision in this country and picked up a lot of ridicule for this \ncountry abroad. It prohibits the U.S. Government from using its funds \nto support private family planning organizations that use their own \nfunds to provide counseling and other services relating to abortion.\n  What my amendment does, it strikes the House provision and it \nreplaces it with the identical Senate language that passed this body on \nSeptember 21. Senator Kassebaum, who is the original author of this \nlanguage, is a cosponsor of this amendment.\n  The amendment says that in determining eligibility for assistance, \nnon-Government and multilateral organizations shall not be subjected to \nrequirements more restrictive to requirements applicable to foreign \ngovernments for such assistance; provided further that none of the \nfunds made available under this act may be used to lobby for or against \nabortion.\n  So no matter what your position is on abortion, U.S. money cannot be \nused to lobby for or against it. This has been very carefully thought \nout to give Senators who have strong views on the subject of abortion a \ncommon ground and be respectful of the views on both sides of this \nissue.\n  The sad thing about the House provision, which we are now seeking to \namend and send back to the other body, is that it is not only totally \nand utterly unnecessary, but if it prevailed on this bill, it \nguarantees a veto, and the work of the Senator from Kentucky, Mr. \nMcConnell, and myself, as well as all the other Senators who joined \nwith us in putting together the foreign aid bill, goes down the drain.\n  Our bill explicitly, and I wish Senators would listen to this, the \nSenate bill explicitly prohibits the use of any U.S. funds for \nabortion. Period. End of sentence. No qualifications.\n  It is the same prohibition that we have had for years. It is the same \nprohibition we had in the last Republican administration. It is the \nsame prohibition we have in this administration. No funds in this bill \ncan be used for abortion.\n  We are really ending up debating bumper-sticker slogans. We are \nending up debating--I do not know--fundraising letters, whatever, but \nwe are not debating the reality of the foreign aid bill.\n  The amendment I offered simply continues current law and practice, \nand at a time when support for voluntary family planning programs and \nwomen's reproductive health is growing around the world, it would be \nridiculous for the United States to, once again, surrender its \nleadership in this area as we did back in the eighties.\n  Some have defended the House provision, because it only prohibits \nU.S. support for foreign organizations. That is precisely the problem. \nIt is by supporting foreign organizations that we implement our family \nplanning programs. We do not stop the population explosion in other \nparts of the country by saying we will send the money to Planned \nParenthood of Winooski, VT. We do it by sending the money where family \nplanning might help. In fact, let me give just one example of what the \nHouse provision would do.\n  A current program that uses United States funds to train Russian \ndoctors in providing family planning services would have to shut down \nbecause it takes place in a Russian hospital. In that Russian hospital, \nRussian funds are used to perform legal abortions. In Russia, the \naverage woman has seven abortions, something I find, and I hope most \npeople would find, to be a terrible situation.\n  But in our program, which tries to help the Russian doctors teach \nfamily planning so they will not be having seven abortions, the House \nprovision says you cannot do that. You cannot do that because in the \nplace where they would teach that, somewhere else in that same building \nabortions might take place.\n  Well, come on, this is Alice in Wonderland. You teach alternatives to \nabortion at a place where people who are interested in that subject \nmight be.\n  The whole point of this program is to promote contraceptives and \nalternatives to abortion. It does not ask for money for abortion, it \nseeks alternatives. Every dollar is for voluntary --voluntary--family \nplanning. I say to my colleagues, if you vote against the amendment of \nthe Senator from Kansas and myself, let there be no mistake, that \nopposes voluntary family planning if you vote against it.\n  The other point I want to emphasize is no funds in this bill can be \nused in China. I heard the debate earlier about people who are \nconcerned about what happens in China. Well, I am concerned. I am \nappalled by forced sterilization. I am appalled by forced abortions. I \nam appalled by the Chinese \n\n[[Page S 16481]]\n\nGovernment telling people, under pain of all kinds of strictures, how \nmany children they can have. We all are, but do not knock down our \nability to help the voluntary family planning in other countries by \nholding up as a straw man somehow the situation in China.\n  Chinese population policy should be condemned, but do not condemn the \nprogram. In fact, the House provision would prevent the United States \nfrom contributing to the U.N. population fund. It is the largest \ninternational family planning agency in the world. UNFPA does not fund \nabortion. It has an explicit policy against supporting abortion. It \nfunds contraceptives, education and informs about family planning in \n140 countries. It is absolutely vital the United States play a leading \nrole in the U.N. agency at a time when the decisions we make today will \ndetermine if the world population doubles or even triples. The Chinese \npopulation policy should be condemned, but do not condemn an \norganization that seeks to demonstrate to the Chinese Government that \nthey can achieve the same results with voluntary family planning.\n  As I said, we contain a prohibition against using U.S. funds in \nChina. That is despite the fact U.N. programs in China promote \nvoluntary family planning and human rights.\n  Mr. President, let us not go backwards, not when so many governments \nare finally seeking out and limiting rates of population growth. Many \nof these countries are already impoverished. We have the technology, \nthe expertise and the interest in helping. The amendment in the House \nrequires UNFPA to withdraw from China. That is a decision not for UNFPA \nbut its governing board, which is made up of its donor governments. By \nattaching a condition UNFPA cannot meet, we cut off funding for \nprograms in 139 other countries.\n\n  So just understand what is here. In the amendment of the Senator from \nKansas and myself, no money for abortion, no money for child care, but \nmoney for voluntary family planning. If you are against voluntarily \nfamily planning, vote against it. But if you would like to see, as we \ndo, the ability to give some of these countries alternatives to \nabortion, then vote with us. And also, with all the work that has gone \ninto this bill, let us complete the bill so it can actually be signed \ninto law by the President and not vetoed.\n  I see the cosponsor, my good friend from Kansas, on the floor. I \nyield to her.\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator \nHatfield be made a cosponsor of this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM. Mr. President, the language that I am cosponsoring \nwith my colleague from Vermont is, as he has said, identical language \nthat was included in the Foreign Operations appropriations bill, which \npassed the Senate in September by a vote of 91-9.\n  It is also language similar to that which passed the Senate in 1984 \nand in 1989. At this time, as Senator Leahy pointed out, House and \nSenate conferees were able to reconcile every other aspect of the \nlegislation, except this issue. The House insisted upon their language, \nwe insisted upon ours and, thus, the bill was reported out of \nconference with this language in disagreement. I think that if the \nHouse passed the language they passed and if we pass the language \noffered in this amendment, it is my understanding that a continuing \nresolution would continue for the bill with everything passed--the \nlanguage of everything passed in a continuing resolution, except \ncurrent language reporting the issue at stake in disagreement here.\n  The language that has been introduced does not change the current \nU.S. policy that prohibits funding for abortion activities. It simply \nensures that foreign governments and nongovernmental organizations will \nbe treated in the same way with respect to establishing eligibility for \nU.S. population assistance. If abortion is legal in a country and if a \nforeign government is engaged in population assistance programs, why \nshould we tell a nongovernmental agency or organization working in that \ncountry that they cannot use U.S. funds? It seems to me they should be \nable to use them for population assistance, Mr. President. That is what \nthis issue is about. It is not about abortion.\n  As I think all colleagues know, this issue first came about in 1984 \nat the International Conference on Population in Mexico City. The \nReagan administration announced that any nongovernmental organization \nwhich used private or non-U.S. funds to contract abortion-related \nactivities would be prohibited from receiving U.S. population \nassistance. If they use their own private, or if their own non-U.S. \nfunds in any way are involved, as the Senator from Vermont pointed out, \nthen they could not receive any U.S. funds for population assistance.\n  I just feel that it is far too limiting, Mr. President. It really \ncripples us in our ability to help other nations deal with population \nassistance initiatives.\n  Since 1973, the United States has prohibited the use of U.S. dollars \nby any recipient of U.S. population assistance to pay for abortions \nabroad. I support this.\n  However, Mr. President, this amendment, as I said before, is not \nabout an abortion. As the Senator from Vermont pointed out, it would \nprohibit funds going to China. It would also prohibit funds which could \nbe used for lobbying for or against abortion. So I think it is \nimportant to keep in mind exactly what it is about. It is about \nsupporting nongovernmental organizations in creating safe, effective, \ncomprehensive family planning programs--programs that are designed to \nprevent the need for abortion.\n  Mr. President, some of my colleagues have argued that the United \nStates should not have a role in international population assistance \nprograms. But while some contend that there is no relationship between \nworld population and our national security, a closer look, I think, at \nall the factors involved make it clear that population stabilization is \nin our best interest. Without such an effort, the world's political, \neconomic, and environmental forces balance precariously on the verge of \nchaos.\n  I think I came to realize this most clearly as I have spent a number \nof years on the Africa Subcommittee in the Foreign Relations Committee. \nIt has shown me that arguments to the contrary are misinformed. The \npopulation assistance initiatives are important. There is no doubt in \nmy mind, for example, that overpopulation played a major role in \ncompounding famine in Africa. I do not think I need to point out to \nanyone here the tragedies that have resulted from that, or could result \nfrom that, and the importance of doing thoughtful, constructive \npopulation assistance initiatives. It is not easy. We have to be very \nsensitive to cultural differences as we work in other countries and \nsupport work in other countries. But, clearly, it seems to me that it \ndoes have merit and it is important.\n  I realize that many of my colleagues here are tired of this fight. \nBut I continue to believe strongly in preventing the need for abortion \nby working to establish effective family planning programs. I hope my \ncolleagues will similarly recognize the need to prevent what has been \ncalled the international gag rule from ever emerging as an obstacle to \ncreating effective policy.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote in favor of this amendment. I suggest, \nMr. President, it is not really an issue of the President vetoing this \nbill. In my mind, it is an issue of the merit or demerit of this \namendment. I feel strongly that this amendment really says that we do \ncare about working together with nongovernmental organizations, with \nother countries, being sensitive and constructive with family planning \ninitiatives.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to be added as a \ncosponsor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I rise in strong support of the Leahy-\nKassebaum amendment. The Senator from Vermont and the Senator from \nKansas have done more in the last few minutes to clarify this issue \nthan I think has been done for some time--the very clear point that the \nSenate position on this in the past does not provide Federal funding \nfor abortions through these organizations. That is the fact. For that \nreason, I stand in strong opposition, as well, to the House language.\n  The House language endangers our national interests. It is not simply \nan \n\n[[Page S 16482]]\n\nantichoice or antiabortion, or a proabortion issue, as some of the \nproponents say. What it is is antifamily planning. The House position \nsmacks of being against the interests of women and international \ndevelopment.\n  Population assistance is a critical component of our foreign aid \nprogram, and a worthy investment in bracing for the threats to U.S. \nnational security that will arise throughout the 21st century.\n  Even President Nixon, who was not known as a prochoice activist, \nlisted population growth ``among the most important issues we face * * \n* a world problem which no country can ignore, whether it is moved by \nthe narrowest perception of national self-interest or the widest vision \nof common humanity.''\n  Indeed, President Nixon pledged full U.S. support and cooperation in \nsupporting U.N. population and family planning programs at the same \ntime the United States played an active role in founding the U.N. \npopulation fund known as the UNFPA.\n  If we were to enact the House language, Mr. President, we would cut \noff support for UNFPA as well as the crucial private organizations \nsupporting family planning and women's rights and manageable population \ngrowth.\n  Mr. President, the world population today stands at 5.7 billion \npeople, almost double what it was in 1960. It is growing by about 100 \nmillion people per year. Most of this growth is in the developing world \nin regions that cannot, of course, sustain their current populations.\n  The environmental and economic effects of this population program are \nvery significant. The effect on women as a population is really \ndisastrous. If development efforts are going to be successful, they \nhave to include the full participation of women--at least 50 percent of \nthe world population.\n  However, if women are not given control of their own bodies, or if \nthey are compelled to carry and deliver unlimited numbers of children, \nthen they cannot be full partners. They cannot be full partners \npolitically, economically, or socially in the development of their \ncountry.\n  The U.S. population programs, in conjunction with international \nstrategies, have actually yielded incredible results for our country \nand for the world. We have seen reductions in maternal mortality rates. \nWe have seen improved child survival statistics. We have seen increased \nliteracy among women. And we have seen healthier, burgeoning economies \nin many parts of the world.\n  Mr. President, this in turn strengthens U.S. efforts to promote food \nsecurity, international trade, and improved public health, all of which \nimprove our standard of living. And they also reduce the risk of \ndisaster assistance or the deployment of U.S. troops, as the Senator \nfrom Kansas was alluding to in her previous remarks.\n  I have had the opportunity to work with the Senator on the Foreign \nAffairs Committee on the subcommittee concerning Africa where these \nproblems can become very, very severe very quickly.\n  The provision of population assistance and family planning services \nis important to the United States. Mr. President, again, it is hardly \nsupport for abortion--although the House amendment infers this.\n  In fact, Mr. President, that is what I think is the fundamental \nmisunderstanding in this debate, and I think we need to dispel that \ntoday. Abortion does not equal family planning; in fact, responsible \nand safe family planning reduces the need for and incidence of \nabortion. Nevertheless, somehow this debate always winds up being a bit \nof a red herring debate about abortion.\n  Mr. President, if the proponents of the House amendment were trying \nto prohibit U.S. funds from being used to pay for abortion, they \nalready achieved that goal many years ago. U.S. foreign assistance \ncannot by law be used to pay for abortion. Let me repeat that: U.S. \nforeign assistance cannot by law--by current law--be used to pay for \nabortion. It says so throughout the foreign aid law, and it is \nreiterated in this conference report that we are considering right now.\n  Now, Mr. President, barring people from speaking about family \nplanning, contraceptives, and abortion will not solve the problem, not \nto mention the fact that it is a blow for the concept of free speech \nthat the United States worked so hard to promote throughout the world.\n  Similarly, cutting off private groups which use funds from other \nsources for their abortion activities is only going to hurt the pursuit \nof U.S. Government interests. As in the 1980's when we saw some of \nthese regressive policies applied, most effective organizations turned \ndown U.S. funding since they could not and would not agree to these \nconditions.\n  I commend them for their perseverance, but I think it was shameful \nthat the United States did not contribute to programs designed to meet \nour own needs. These are the reasons that the House language on Mexico \nCity policy and the gag rule have to be stripped from this conference \nreport and why the Kassebaum language should be restored.\n  As for these counterproductive restrictions on UNFPA, I again submit, \nas I and others did before the Foreign Affairs Committee, that this is \nan attack on family planning. It is not a serious attempt to stop \nabortion, nor is it a serious attempt to do anything about the \ndisgusting practice of coercive abortion.\n  Pulling out of the U.N. population fund is not going to stop coercive \nabortion in China, for the simple fact that UNFPA does not engage if \nany coercive abortion procedures in China now. UNFPA's mandate in every \ncountry, including China, is the provision of family planning services \nand maternal and child health care in 140 countries around the world. \nIt has no mandate--it has no mandate--to engage in the provision of \nabortion or abortion-related services.\n  Mr. President, in reality, it is programs supported by the UNFPA that \nmake abortion less likely. If I believe that withdrawing from the UNFPA \nwould reduce the incidence of coercive abortion in China, I would \nwholeheartedly support such a move.\n  Human rights abuses such as this should be addressed at the United \nNations and through diplomatic and economic levers such as the most-\nfavored-nation status approach, which I have advocated and continue to \nadvocate with regard to China.\n  In fact, this is one of the reasons why I introduced legislation this \nyear with the chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, Senator \nHelms, to withdraw MFN from China.\n  Mr. President, prohibiting United States contributions unless the \nUNFPA pulls out of China is going to do nothing to solve this problem. \nUNFPA officials have already expressed their firm opposition to the \npractice of coercive abortion despite what some Members on this floor \nhave said in what amounts to misquoting the organization.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record, Mr. President, \na letter I received from the UNFPA on their perceptions on the China \npolicy, which I hope will clear up the misunderstanding.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                               United Nations Population Fund,\n\n                                      New York, NY, July 26, 1995.\n     Senator Russell Feingold,\n     Senate Russell Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Feingold: It has just come to my attention \n     that on June 28, 1995 during a debate on the House floor, \n     Representative Chris Smith quoted Dr. Sadik, Executive \n     Director of UNFPA, ``China has every reason to feel proud of \n     and pleased with its remarkable achievements made in its \n     family planning policy and control of its population growth \n     over the past 10 years. Now the country could offer its \n     experiences and special experts to help other countries.'' \n     Senator Jesse Helms used the same quote in the Senate Foreign \n     Relations Committee Report accompanying S-961.\n       I believe this quote comes from China Daily, an English \n     language newspaper published in Beijing. I was with Dr. Sadik \n     when she was interviewed for this article in 1991. This \n     article was a terrible distortion of what she actually said. \n     Dr. Sadik did say that China should be proud of its record of \n     improving women's and children's health since 1949. She \n     commended China's continuing efforts to improve maternal and \n     child health by discussing a joint UNFPA and UNICEF project \n     in 300 poor counties in China that especially focuses on \n     improving children's health through training and supplies for \n     treatment of acute respiratory infection and diarrhea, \n     promotion of prenatal care and nutrition, breast-feeding, \n     assisted deliveries and family planning that assured several \n     contraceptive choices and informed consent. \n\n[[Page S 16483]]\n\n     She went on to say that this project was a model that could \n     be replicated in other countries.\n       I have no idea why Dr. Sadik was misquoted. I tried \n     unsuccessfully at the time to secure a retraction from China \n     Daily. I remember during her visit being very proud of Dr. \n     Sadik's tenacity and courage and my disappointment with the \n     China Daily article which was not only wrong, but \n     contradictory of her real position.\n       In fact, during this trip, Dr. Sadik attended a series of \n     meetings that included: the Ministers of Family Planning and \n     Health, the Head of the People's Congress and several of his \n     colleagues and the General Secretary of the Communist Party \n     of China. During these meetings she was very critical of new \n     laws in several provinces requiring sterilization of the \n     mentally retarded. She also successfully negotiated projects \n     designed to increase training for informed consent and \n     voluntary participation in family planning, and research that \n     would examine the safety and efficacy of the Chinese steel \n     ring IUD. The first project, currently on-going, provides \n     interpersonal counseling training and promotes contraceptive \n     choices for grass-roots family planning workers in several \n     provinces. The second resulted in a Chinese ban on steel ring \n     IUD's in favor of copper based IUD's which in ten years will \n     prevent 35.6 million abortions. It would also prevent 6,300 \n     maternal deaths; 365,000 potential infant and 28,000 \n     potential child deaths.\n       For 3-\\1/2\\ years I served as UNFPA's Country Director in \n     China. I know first hand what we did and said in China and I \n     can tell you that the way we are frequently portrayed, such \n     as in the statement in question, is absolutely and \n     unequivocally untrue.\n       UNFPA has always represented international norms and human \n     rights standards as articulated in several U.N. documents \n     including the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the \n     World Population Plan of Action and the Programme of Action \n     of the International Conference on Population and \n     Development. For example, Chapter VII, para. 12 of the \n     Programme of Action which states ``. . . the principle of \n     informed free choice is essential to the long-term success of \n     family-planning programmes; that any form of coercion has no \n     part of play; that governmental goals or family planning \n     should be defined in terms of unmet needs for information and \n     services; and that demographic goals, while legitimately the \n     subject of government development strategies, should not be \n     imposed on family-planning providers in the form of targets \n     or quotes for the recruitment of clients''.\n       In particular, Dr. Sadik has been a champion of human \n     rights, women's equality and reproductive rights. In the 14 \n     years I have known her, I have never heard her use the phrase \n     ``population control.''\n       We deeply appreciate your past and continuing support and \n     hope you can help set the record straight regarding the quote \n     used by Representative Smith and Senator Helms.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                          Stirling D. Scruggs,\n\n                                            Chief, Information and\n                                      External Relations Division.\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. United States funds are already adequately and \nelaborately protected from being used in China at all. In reality, what \nthe House amendment is trying to do is prohibit U.S. support for family \nplanning in the 140 other countries that the UNFPA operates. It \nessentially punishes the United States and other countries of the \ninternational community for China's human rights violations which the \nUNFPA, again, is simply not responsible for.\n  As we look to the 21st century, we should have a post-Mexico City \npolicy on population. The House amendment brings us backward--not \nforward. Family planning is too important for us to lose ground on. But \nthat is exactly what the House amendment does. It causes us to lose \nground on population control.\n  We cannot let this stand, Mr. President. I urge my colleagues to \nsupport the Leahy amendment and to strip this extreme amendment from \nthe bill. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Gorton). The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, let me first say I intend to speak for just \na moment on the budget and on the President's veto threat.\n  However, let me say about the pending amendment that the House of \nRepresentatives has taken a very clear position that maintains the \nposition that Congress has historically taken--that is, there is a \nhigher standard when you are spending the taxpayers' money.\n  In spending the taxpayers' money, the House has taken the position \nthat we should not be spending the taxpayers' money either in the \nUnited States or around the world to fund abortion on demand, and we \nshould not be spending the taxpayers' money to subsidize forced \nabortions in China.\n  I think we need to reject this amendment. I think we need to stay \nwith the House position. I am confident that we will.\n  Mr. President, our leader, Senator Dole, and the Speaker of the \nHouse, Congressman Gingrich, are both down at the White House today \nmeeting with the President about the growing confrontation concerning \nour budget.\n  I wanted to make some remarks about this confrontation because I \nthink we are coming down to the moment of truth where each of us is \ngoing to have to decide what the 1994 elections were about, what we \nstand for, what we are willing to stand up and fight for, and what we \nare willing to compromise on.\n  I want to make just a few observations this afternoon on those \nsubjects.\n  First of all, we have adopted in both the House and the Senate a \nbudget that does what we promised to do in the election. It balances \nthe budget over a 7-year period. It saves Medicare. It reforms welfare. \nIt changes the relationship between the Government and the people.\n  In a very modest way, it begins to let working families keep more of \nwhat they earn to invest in their own children, their own families, and \ntheir own futures.\n  The President has said so many times that he is going to veto our \nbudget bill, that I think people are beginning to believe him--not that \nrepetition is always a guarantee. But I think we have to start thinking \nseriously about the possibility that the President might veto the \nbudget bill that we have passed.\n  I think it is important for individual Members of the Senate to start \nmaking it clear where they stand on this issue. That is what I want to \ndo this afternoon.\n  First of all, the President is asking us, by vetoing our budget, to \ncontinue to spend money we do not have on programs we cannot afford.\n  The President has sent not one but two budgets to Congress, and both \nof those budgets would increase the public debt by over $1 trillion in \n5 years. Neither of those budgets would ever come into balance at any \nfinite time in the future. Both of those budgets would give us a \ndeficit that greatly exceeds $200 billion in the year that our budget \nwould be in balance.\n  Now, the President says he is going to veto our budget to force us to \nspend more money. Let me make it clear that no matter what might be \nagreed to, I am not going to vote to bust the budget that we wrote here \non the floor of the U.S. Senate. Under no circumstances am I going to \nvote to increase spending above the level we set out in our budget.\n  The President has every right, if he wants to enter legitimately into \nthe debate by submitting a real budget that is balanced over a 7-year \nperiod, to negotiate with us about spending priorities. It is obvious \nhis priorities are different, but I think those differences are \nlegitimate, and I think they ought to be debated. But, unless the \nPresident is going to submit a budget to us which tell us how he would \nbalance the Federal budget, I am not willing to allow him to force us \nto back away from our budget.\n  Our proposal to the President, as a precondition for our negotiation \nwith him, ought to include the following items:\n  No. 1. Tell us how you would balance the budget over a 7-year period, \nnot by wishing the problem away, but in terms that we can all \nunderstand and in terms that the Congressional Budget Office, which is \nthe accountant for this process as designated by the President, can \ncertify will really achieve a balanced budget. From that point we can \nthen begin to compare the two budgets.\n  Second, it seems to me if the President is really committed to \nbalancing the budget, he ought to endorse the balanced budget amendment \nto the Constitution, which has passed the House and which is only one \nvote short of the two-thirds vote needed to pass the Senate and send to \nthe States. I want to call on the President, if he is serious about \nbalancing the budget, to come out and endorse the balanced budget \namendment to the Constitution, to help us get one additional Democrat \nto vote for it, and in the process allow us to send it to the States.\n  I believe it is high time that we let working people keep more of \nwhat they earn. In 1950, the average family with two children sent $1 \nout of every $50 to Washington. Today, that family is \n\n[[Page S 16484]]\n\nsending $1 out of every $4 to Washington. I think our action of giving \na $500 tax credit per child for every working family in America so they \ncan spend their own money on their own children and on their own \nfutures, is long overdue. There is no circumstance under which I am \ngoing to back away from our tax cut so that Bill Clinton can spend more \nmoney in Washington, DC.\n  This is not a debate about how much money we spend on children, but \nit is certainly a debate about who is going to do the spending. \nPresident Clinton and the Democrats want the Government to do the \nspending. We want the family to do the spending. We know the \nGovernment. We know the family. And we know the difference.\n  So, I think, to conclude and let the debate go back to the amendment \nbefore the Senate, for 40 years we have been running up bills in \nWashington, DC. For 40 years we have been borrowing more and more \nmoney. The President's argument to us is, ``We have run up these bills. \nRaise the debt ceiling and pay the bills.''\n  It reminds me of an argument that was made when I was a young Member \nof Congress, in my first year, the first debate I ever participated in. \nThen-majority leader of the House Jim Wright got up when we were \ngetting ready to vote on the debt ceiling, and he said, ``It is as if \nyour spouse has run up a big bill on the credit card and the bill \ncollector is knocking at the door. You have to pay your bills.''\n  That is what the President is in essence saying to us.\n  My response is, let us look at what American families do under these \ncircumstances. They do pay their bills. But they do something we have \nnot done in 40 years. They sit down around the kitchen table, they get \nout a pad and pencil, they write down how much money they earn, they \nstart adding up their expenses, they put together a budget, they get \nout their credit cards, they get out the butcher knife, they cut up \ntheir credit cards, and they resolve that, while they are going to pay \ntheir bills today, they are not going to put themselves in a position \nwhere every year the bill collector is pounding on the door.\n  I believe defaulting on the public debt would be irresponsible. I \nbelieve shutting the Government down to make a political point is \nunnecessary and unfair. But there is something worse than defaulting on \nthe debt. There is something worse than shutting the Government down. \nAnd that is continuing a spending spree that will destroy the future of \nour children. That is worse than both shutting the Government down and \ndefaulting on the debt. And I am not going to vote for a budget, and I \nam not going to vote for a compromise, that continues the spending \nspree in Washington, DC.\n  The American people in 1994 gave us a Republican majority in both \nHouses of Congress with a clear mandate: Stop the taxing, stop the \nspending, and stop the regulating. I, for one, am not willing to cut a \ndeal in Washington, DC, with President Clinton, to undercut an election \nthat sought to fundamentally change the way Government is run in \nWashington, DC.\n  So I think we ought to negotiate with the President. I think we ought \nto try to work with the President. But we ought to make it very clear \nto the President that we are not going to back away from our commitment \nto balance the budget. We are not going to spend money we do not have \non programs we cannot afford. And there is no amount of threat and \nbluster that can be exercised by the President that is going to induce \nus to pull down our budget and continue the spending spree in \nWashington, DC.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I rise to support the Leahy-Kassebaum \namendment on family planning.\n  The House has taken an extreme position on international family \nplanning. If their position prevails, the world's poorest women will \npay the price. I urge my colleagues to stick with the Senate position. \nThe Senate bill prohibits funds from being used to perform abortions--\nor to do anything in China. But it does this while continuing to \nprovide family planning services and maternal and children's health \ncare to the poorest people in the world.\n  The House position is extreme because it would gut our international \nfamily planning programs. It would prohibit organizations that use \ntheir own funds for abortion services from receiving any U.S. funds. It \nwould prohibit these organizations from offering any information on \nabortion--even factual information about mortality related to unsafe \nabortion. The House amendment would also limit U.S. participation in \nUNFPA--which has the infrastructure, the expertise, and the personnel \nto be the most effective program for providing family planning services \naround the world.\n  The effects of this House position on women's health would be \ndisastrous. Over 100 million women throughout the world cannot obtain \nor are not using family planning because they are poor, uneducated, or \nlack access to care. Twenty million of these women will seek unsafe \nabortions. Some women will die, some will be disabled. Many of these \nwomen are very young; they are, in fact, still children themselves. \nWhen children have children, they often lose their chance to obtain \nschooling, a good job, and ultimately, self-sufficiency. If the House \nposition prevails, women will not be able to fully participate in \ndevelopment and democratization.\n  In this bill, we seek to maintain our modest role in providing family \nplanning to the world's poorest women. To this end, we should be clear \nabout what is in the bill--and what is not.\n  This bill does not contain money for abortions or abortion lobbying. \nFederal funds cannot be used to fund abortions and this bill retains \nthis prohibition. In fact, opponents of this amendment include Senators \nwho strongly oppose abortion. They know that effective family planning \nactually reduces the number of abortions performed. And this bill does \nnot contain money for China. No United States funds may currently be \nspent in China and the bill retains this policy as well.\n  This bill maintains current law. It continues to provide modest \nfunding for the United Nations Population Fund [UNFPA]. Without this \nassistance, the influence of the United States in the UNFPA is cut off. \nWe would have no say on how and where international family planning \nservices are delivered.\n  This bill continues to provide funds to the most efficient and \neffective private and nongovernmental organization. It is these \norganizations who know best how to make a little funding go a long way.\n  Mr. President, I wish we could do more to ensure that all women have \naccess to family planning. The Leahy-Kassebaum amendment--which \nreaffirms the bill passed by the Senate-- ensures that we continue to \ndo something to help the world's poorest women to control and improve \ntheir lives. I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, we have debated the issue of \nrestrictions on international family planning many times in this body, \nand I regret that at this stage in the process, this issue threatens to \nbring down an important foreign aid bill.\n  This body voted by a significant margin just 1 month ago to preserve \na reasoned family planning policy--one that supports important family \nplanning work in the most needy areas around the globe. Population \ngrowth is a crisis that cannot be ignored, that will not wait for \nattention at a later date. Unchecked population growth will ultimately \nthreaten every corner of the globe. And a withdrawal on our part from \nour current active role in education and technical assistance to \nsuccessful family planning programs worldwide would be devastating.\n  Experience has proven that it does not take a lot of money to have a \nlarge effect upon population growth. However, it does take efficient \nprogramming, consistency, and a commitment for the long term. We put \nthat all at risk in this debate today if we back away from the \nlongstanding position of this body, that restrictions on family \nplanning funding to nongovernmental organizations overseas should be \nthe same as those applied to U.S. organizations.\n  Mr. President, the stakes in this debate are even higher today than \nusual. This is the only issue in disagreement between the two bodies on \na large and substantive bill; 192 differences have been resolved, \nresulting in a reasonable bill that, with the exception of this \n\n[[Page S 16485]]\n\nissue alone, has broad support on both sides of the aisle in both \nbodies and is acceptable to the administration. Yet, failure to insist \non the Senate position on this important issue, namely a continuation \nof current law, would doom this important legislation to a certain \nveto. We have enough issues in disagreement with the administration \nwithout adding this one to the list.\n  I thank the Senator from Kansas [Mrs. Kassebaum] for her consistent \nleadership on this issue and I urge support for the Leahy-Kassebaum \namendment.\n Mr. HATFIELD. Mr. President, once again the Senate and the \nHouse face the prospect of holding up an important appropriations bill \nover the issue of abortion. I am dismayed that we find ourselves in \nthis position especially because the bill before the Senate clearly and \nexplicitly prohibits the use of U.S. funds to pay or lobby for abortion \nin our foreign aid programs. The programs at stake involve family \nplanning--not abortion.\n  I am strongly pro-life and do not support abortion except in cases \nwhere the life of the mother is endangered. I am also strongly pro-\nfamily planning and have long been an outspoken supporter of our \ndomestic and international family planning efforts. I support family \nplanning because I believe if more couples have access to \ncontraceptives and understand the consequences of the lack of family \nplanning, we can make abortion a moot issue.\n  But beyond making abortion a moot issue, there are also development \nand environmental consequences of uncontrolled population growth. \nAccording to the United Nations, the 1990's will see the greatest \nincrease in human numbers of any decade, as the world's population \ngrows from 5.3 billion to 6.25 billion by the end of this century. We \nknow that rapid population growth in the developing world can overwhelm \nthe gains made in living standards.\n  According to the World Bank, in sub-Saharan Africa the 3.7-percent \ngrowth in gross domestic product will not be sufficient to offset the \neffects of skyrocketing population growth, and the number of poor will \nincrease. On the environment front, when we look at ozone depletion, \nglobal warming, destruction of tropical rain forests, and the \nelimination of species diversity, we inevitably see the connection \nbetween those phenomena and the population explosion.\n  The international family planning programs that we fund through the \nU.S. Agency for International Development and the United Nations \nPopulation Fund [UNFPA] ensure that the United States will maintain a \nleadership role in addressing the population problem. The House \nlimitations which were struck by the Senate would undermine our ability \nto continue to play this important role.\n  I would like to mention in particular our support of the UNFPA. The \nHouse amendment would prohibit the United States from participating in \nthe UNFPA unless the President certifies that the UNFPA will withdraw \nits program from China. No one condones China's coercive abortion \npolicy--I certainly do not. In fact, there are specific prohibitions \nalready in law on the use of United States funds for UNFPA's program in \nChina. And although there have been allegations that UNFPA funds were \ngoing to support coercive abortions in China, these allegations have \nnever been substantiated. The problem is with China's family planning \nprogram, not the UNFPA's.\n  Despite the fact that the United States has been quite outspoken \nagainst the practices in China and has already prohibited the use of \nour funds there, those opposed to family planning continue to use it as \na reason to withdraw all of our support for the UNFPA. This would mean \nthat the U.S. could not participate in a program that has the ability \nto reach into areas where no single U.S. program can. The UNFPA \ncurrently provides voluntary family planning assistance to over 140 \ncountries besides China; 90 of those nations have populations expected \nto double within the next 30 years. In addition, nearly half of UNFPA's \nassistance is used for family planning services and maternal and child \nhealth care in the poorest, most remote regions in the world. As a \nnation, we cannot afford to limit our participation in the UNFPA.\n  Therefore, I am pleased to say that I am a cosponsor of the Leahy-\nKassebaum amendment to strike the House amendment and return to current \nlaw on lobbying for or against abortion which was so carefully crafted \nby our colleague from Kansas. I hope that the Senate will retain the \nposition we had when we first passed this bill. Moreover, I hope those \non both sides of the issue will take a closer look at what we are doing \nby polarizing the issue of abortion and using it to hold up these very \nimportant funding bills. Can we not come together to try to resolve the \nabortion question through the authorizing process? If not, I am afraid \nwe are relegating ourselves to years of deadlock and further \npolarization.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I rise today in strong support of the \namendment to H.R. 1868, the Foreign Operations Appropriations Act of \n1996 offered by my good friend from Kansas, Senator Kassebaum, and my \ngood friend from Vermont, Senator Leahy.\n  Mr. President, international population growth is a significant issue \nfor foreign policy for the United States. It is a significant issue for \ndomestic policy, for that matter. Of all the challenges facing our \nNation and the world, none compares to that of increasing population \ngrowth.\n  Our efforts to protect the environment, to promote economic \ndevelopment around the world, and to raise the status of women, will be \nfutile if we do not first address the staggering rate of global \npopulation growth.\n  How can we expect underdeveloped countries to pull themselves up when \nthe world's population is growing at a rate of more than 10,000 people \nper hour? Today, there are more than 5.7 billion people on this Earth.\n  We simply must address these issues. We must acknowledge that we \ncannot talk about population growth without talking about the very real \nand very tragic effects of overpopulation:\n  First, the destruction of our environment; and\n  Second, the destruction of people--mostly women and young children \nwho live in poverty and die from malnutrition, starvation, lack of \naccess to basic health care, and botched illegal abortions.\n  We need to be working to address these issues instead of spending \ncountless hours debating our philosophical differences on abortion. We \nhave been over that issue more times than any of us care to count.\n  Mr. President, I believe direct, substantial, and long-term benefits \nflow to American families from our national investment in sustainable \ndevelopment and population efforts.\n  Today, as we approach the 21st century, we are facing a world that \nwill be more economically competitive and more challenging than ever \nbefore. This is not the time to be weakening our role as the world \nleader in these areas.\n  Instead, I believe it is in the best interest of America's children \nand families for the Congress to reaffirm and solidify our commitment \nto population stabilization, reproductive choice, and other critical \nhealth and sustainable development programs.\n  For the past 12 years or so, I have spent a lot of my time here in \nthe Senate focussing on the domestic and international high-technology \nindustries. I have worked to develop strategies to strengthen the \ntechnology and manufacturing bases in this country and to secure higher \nwage jobs for Americans.\n  I have focussed on these issues because of my concern for the long-\nterm economic viability of our Nation. I believe that to secure our \neconomic future, the United States must be fully equipped to compete \nlong term with Japan and other highly developed countries.\n  But at the same time, I believe we cannot have a successful economic \nstrategy in this country if we do not devote serious attention to the \neconomies of the developing world.\n  Over the past 10 years or so, growth in U.S. exports to the \ndeveloping world has exploded; and today, developing countries account \nfor about 40 percent of a growing U.S. export market.\n  In fact, trade with the developing world is growing at a rate that \nfar exceeds the growth rate of U.S. exports to developed countries.\n\n[[Page S 16486]]\n\n  I believe a significant factor in this growth has been the modest \nU.S. commitment to development and population assistance in the \ndeveloping countries.\n  Mr. President, funding for efforts such as those of the U.N. \nPopulation Fund and the UNFPA, are critical to addressing these issues \nwhich are among the most serious the world faces and is why I rise in \nstrong support of the Kassebaum-Leahy amendment to the foreign \noperations appropriations bill and hope that we will once again send a \nstrong message to the House that this funding must, and will, be \npreserved.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, the Leahy-Kassebaum amendment puts me in a \ndifficult position because it combines two separate issues.\n  On one hand, I have consistently supported efforts to reverse the so-\ncalled Mexico City or International Gag Rule policy and therefore \nsupport reinserting the Kassebaum language that overturns the Mexico \nCity policy.\n  On the other hand, I have consistently opposed United States funding \nfor the U.N. Population Fund while the organization continues to \noperate in China. The amendment before us would strike a restriction on \nUNFPA funding that I have supported.\n  Of course, I must vote yes or no on the entire amendment. I cannot \nvote for part and against part.\n  Therefore, upon reflection, I will vote in favor of the amendment. \nInternational family planning programs provide important services that \nlead to healthier families and help to prevent high population growth \nrates, environmental degradation, and the need for abortion.\n  We can and we should continue to prohibit U.S. tax dollars from being \nused for abortions. But, I believe that the U.S. Government should not \nbe dictating what nongovernmental organizations do with their own funds \nin their work to provide family planning services around the globe, as \nlong as they do not use any Federal funds for abortion.\n  Nevertheless, I would like to make it clear to my colleagues and \nconstituents that my vote today does not represent a change in my \nposition on U.S. funding for the U.N. Population Fund at this time. We \nmust continue to do all that we can to pressure the Government of China \nto cease any program of forced abortion or sterilization as a means of \npopulation control.\n  Ms. SNOWE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise in support of the amendment that has \nbeen offered by Senator Leahy and Senator Kassebaum. I ask unanimous \nconsent to be included as cosponsor of that amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, first of all I would like to correct a few \nof the statements that were made by the previous speaker, the Senator \nfrom Texas. He said that this position that is embraced in the \namendment of Senator Leahy and Senator Kassebaum has been rejected by \nthe Congress in the past. That is not true. Back in 1989 both the House \nand the Senate, in fact, rejected the Mexico City policy.\n  In addition, he said this amendment before us today embraces coercive \nabortion. Nothing could be further from the truth. No one here supports \ncoercive abortions. It is morally wrong, and, furthermore, it is \nillegal.\n  The fact is, our policy does not support abortions in terms of \ninternational family planning assistance. Unfortunately, this issue has \nbeen misrepresented so many times in the past. We have to get beyond \nthose misrepresentations with respect to this issue.\n  The United States does not support, through its international family \nplanning assistance, abortion. Those funds cannot even be commingled \nwith an organization that may use its funds for abortion. The fact of \nthe matter is, under the Mexico City policy, our funds could still go \nto a government that uses its own funds for abortion or abortion-\nrelated activities. Yet, on the other hand, we deny those organizations \nwho are the most instrumental and the most effective in providing \ninternational family planning assistance, family planning money, if in \nfact they use their own private funds for abortion-related activities.\n  This amendment would overturn the Mexico City policy. That is what \nthe Senate voted on, and, I might add, by a vote of 57 to 43--57 to 43.\n  Unfortunately, the House has chosen not to compromise at all on this \nissue. But I would urge the Senate to stay firm and committed to the \nposition that we have taken--that not only do we reject the Mexico City \npolicy, but that, yes, we continue to provide funds to UNFPA which we \nare also on record in support of.\n  I think it is unfortunate that we have so many different issues \nentangled. The issue is whether or not you support family planning. If \nyou are against abortion, the most reasonable approach to take is to \nsupport international family planning programs. The United States has \nbeen the forerunner. We were a leader in international family planning \nassistance. We cofounded UNFPA. We sit on their governing board. Now we \nare saying, well, we are sorry. We will somehow untangle all of this \nfamily planning money under the notion of abortion when, in fact, our \nmoney does not go for that purpose. If we are truly serious about \nsupporting family planning programs that are effective, then we have to \nprovide the necessary funding. That is what this is all about. We are \nasking that we put into permanent law a nondiscriminatory policy on the \nfunding of private organizations, that we treat them the same as we do \nforeign governments. It is a matter of simple fairness, and it should \nbe preserved.\n  What we are talking about here today are the programs that are so \nessential that will make a difference in the developing countries. \nThese include voluntary family planning services, contraceptive \nresearch, maternal health programs, and child survival programs.\n  That is what we are talking about. We are not talking about abortion. \nThe fact is that this Congress back in 1973 passed the Helms amendment \nthat prohibits the use of any U.S. funds for abortion-related \nactivities. That is the law. That will continue to be the law. What we \nare supporting is assistance through international family planning \nprograms, and to those private organizations that have been the most \neffective around the world.\n  So it is a matter of whether or not we want to assist those countries \nthat have a truly difficult problem in controlling population growth, \nif we deny assistance as American assistance to these programs, such as \nthe International Planned Parenthood Program that provides more than \nassistance to more than 160 countries. When the Mexico City policy that \ntook effect that Senator Kassebaum referred to back in 1984, 50 of \nthose affiliates around the world were denied assistance. This has \nimpaired our ability to support the most capable family planning \nprograms in countries such India, which has more births each year than \ndo Nigeria, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Indonesia, Brazil, and Mexico \ncombined.\n  I think it is a sad irony that by the time the Mexico City Conference \n10 years ago embraced this policy that denial of additional American \nassistance to family planning programs came at a time when most \ndeveloping countries had come to understand the importance of voluntary \nfamily planning programs to their own countries' development. It is \ninteresting because it took that long for us to convince other \ncountries what they needed to do, and the validity of those programs \nand the impact it would have in containing the growth in those \ncountries. Now we are attempting to resume our leadership role, and \nsome are asking us to turn our backs.\n  If we believe in voluntarism and family planning--and we do--and, if \nwe believe that abortion should be avoided as a method of family \nplanning--and we do--then we should maintain our leadership. We have \nunrivaled influence in setting standards for family planning programs. \nA great number of other donors and recipient countries adopted our own \nmodel in their own program.\n  And I would hope that we would reject the arguments in that tradition \nin the position taken by the House of Representatives with respect to \nthis issue because it is taking us a step backward. We talk about UNFPA \nbeing a leader, an organization that has been \n\n[[Page S 16487]]\n\na leader in international family planning programs, and, in fact, \nprovides a third of all of the assistance in delivering family planning \nprograms around the world.\n  UNFPA does not support coercive abortions in China. No one does. We \nput a number of restrictions on our assistance to UNFPA because they \nstill work in China. They are trying to prevent what is happening in \nChina. But we put restrictions in any event so those who say our money \nis fungible can be transferred to one account to another. The United \nStates did not contribute to UNFPA during the time of the Mexico City \npolicy. We also denied assistance to UNFPA, but in 1993 the U.S. \nresumed contributions to the UNFPA organizations with four major \nlimitations. One, that no United States funds could go to China; two, \nUnited States funds are prohibited from funding coercive abortions and \ninvoluntary sterilization; that United States funds to UNFPA must be \nheld in a separate account from all other UNFPA funds so there is no \ncomingling; and, that UNFPA funding for China could not increase for \nthe 5 years once the United States resumes its contributions to UNFPA. \nIn fact, the UNFPA program in China will end at the end of this year.\n  So we have enormous protection in the event that any money would be \ntransferred indirectly--not indirectly because we have never provided \nfunds in that regard--but even indirectly because of UNFPA's presence \nin China. So we have put all those protections into law.\n  But now people are saying we should not provide any assistance to \nUNFPA. That is the leading organization providing and supporting \nmultilateral family planning programs throughout the developing world. \nI think that is a truly regrettable. We should be doing everything that \nwe can to assist these countries in controlling their population \nproblems because we know the implications that it has for global and \neconomic instability.\n  So I think that we as a country should be a leader in that regard as \nwe have been in the past. I hope we will resume that leadership role.\n  Mr. President, I urge Members of the Senate to adopt the amendment \noffered by Senator Leahy and Senator Kassebaum. I think that there is \nno question that these countries need our assistance. They need our \nhelp. They need our leadership in international family planning--not \nonly in our country and our own future, but for theirs as well.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mrs. MURRAY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, thank you.\n  Mr. President, I rise in support of the Leahy-Kassebaum amendment on \nfunding for international family planning programs and against the \nHouse position to cut and restrict family planning aid.\n  I want to commend my colleague from Maine, Senator Snowe, for the \nexcellent statement which she just made on the subject.\n  The House position, which we should all vote to reject, is a wolf in \nsheep's clothing. It pretends to be anti-abortion. But in fact, it is \nanti-family planning and does not affect the question of abortion \nfunding at all.\n  In addition, the House position pretends to address the horrendous \nproblem of forced abortions in the People's Republic of China--in the \nguise of trying to solve that terrible problem by denying United States \nsupport for the United Nations Population Fund.\n  Mr. President, the debate surrounding UNFPA began over a decade ago \nduring the Reagan administration. Foes of UNFPA claimed then, as they \ndo today, that the United States should withdraw support for UNFPA \nbecause of the fund's presence in China, where there have been \npersistent reports of government sanctioned forced abortions.\n  Mr. President, there is no question that the Chinese do many things \nthat I abhor. Forcing women to have abortions or forcing individuals to \nundergo sterilization is a gross violation of human rights and should \nbe condemned by our Government at the highest level.\n  Likewise, the killing of female infants in China is widespread and \nrepugnant--and appears to often go unpunished by Chinese officials.\n  But it would be illogical--and counterproductive--for the United \nStates to pull out of those international agencies that give aid to \nchildren in China because the horrific practice of female infanticide \nplagues that nation.\n  So why should we ask UNFPA to carry the sins of China on its \nshoulders when it comes to the question of family planning?\n  The facts have never supported this approach.\n  When the question of UNFPA funding was first debated during the \nReagan administration, officials under President Reagan investigated \nthe issue and found--and I quote from an AID document from that time--\nthat ``UNFPA is a benevolent factor in China which works to decrease \nthe incidence of coercive abortion'' in China by providing effective \nfamily planning services. That same Reagan administration investigation \nfound absolutely ``no evidence'' that UNFPA participated in or \nsupported in any way China's coercive family planning practices.\n  Sadly, caught up in the pro-life politics of the time, UNFPA was \nnonetheless defunded by President Reagan. President Clinton has since \nresumed U.S. support for this agency, and therein lie the roots of \ntoday's debate.\n  Through all of this, however, the facts have been clear--that UNFPA \nhas been part of the solution in China, by helping to reduce the \nincidence of abortion in that country and others by providing high \nquality voluntary family planning services.\n  UNFPA's goal is to eliminate the need for abortions. They do so by \nproviding maternal and child health care and voluntary family planning \nservices. These are the kinds of programs that are unquestionably the \nmost effective means of preventing abortion. And the majority of \nUNFPA's assistance goes towards projects in these areas.\n  In addition to targeting UNFPA funding for elimination, the House \nposition seeks to reinstate language similar to what used to be called \nthe Mexico City policy.\n  The House-adopted language is broad and ambiguous. It will impose a \ngag rule on foreign nongovernmental family planning organizations--\ndenying those organizations U.S. support if they provide certain \nservices--not limited to abortion--with their non-U.S. funds.\n  For example, in Russia, where abortion is legal, the United States \ncurrently provides humanitarian aid to help local family planning \nclinics deliver better services to women. Years ago, the United States \ndetermined this to be a priority within our Russian aid program because \nof the tragically high abortion rate for Russian women who, lacking \nfamily planning services, often have as many as 10 or 12 abortions over \ntheir life time.\n  If, however, we adopt the House language, we may be prevented from \nhelping Russian family planning clinics simply because those clinics \nare affiliated with Russian hospitals where abortions are performed.\n  This would be making a bad situation worse--pulling support from \nclinics that are doing their best with scarce resources to provide \nalternatives to abortion for so many desperate Russian women.\n  So the House language is double trouble--targeting UNFPA, the world's \nlargest source of voluntary family planning services, as well as the \nhundreds of smaller local family planning providers around the \ndeveloping world.\n  Ironically, by denying support for so many organizations that provide \nquality family planning services, the House language might well have \nthe unintended effect of increasing the incidence of abortion in China \nand elsewhere.\n  As has been pointed out by others during this debate, the foreign \noperations conference report continues the longstanding policy of \nbanning the use of U.S. funds for abortions overseas. That ban, \ncommonly known as the Helms Amendment, has been a part of the permanent \nforeign aid statute since 1973 and remains unchanged in the committee's \nbill.\n\n  Further, the conference report prohibits the use of U.S. funds for \nabortion lobbying.\n  In addition, UNFPA's own position on abortion provides additional \nsafeguards. UNFPA does not, and never has, supported abortions or \nabortion-related services in any country in which it operates.\n\n[[Page S 16488]]\n\n  According to the UNFPA's governing Council, it is ``the policy of the \nUNFPA . . . not to provide assistance for abortion, abortion services, \nor abortion-related equipment and supplies as a method of family \nplanning.''\n  So the real question facing the Senate today is this: The conference \nreport is already stringently anti-abortion. But if we adopt the House \nlanguage, thereby disqualifying the most tried and true family planning \norganizations from receiving U.S. support, do we really want to make \nthis bill anti-family planning as well?\n  Let me take a minute to review for my colleagues why U.S. support for \nvoluntary family planning is so important.\n  While childbirth anywhere carries certain risks, in the developing \nworld mothers face grave statistics. In Africa, for example, 1 out of \nevery 21 women will die as a result of pregnancy or childbirth, making \nthe African woman 200 times more likely to die as a result of bearing \nher children than a European woman.\n  The kinds of programs provided by UNFPA and other voluntary family \nplanning organizations can prevent many of these maternal deaths.\n  So when we support family planning aid, we are supporting those women \nand families across the developing world who seek the means to space \ntheir births and avoid high-risk pregnancies.\n  Equally important, when we support family planning aid, we are \nincreasing the chances that child survival rates will increase across \nthe developing world.\n  We know that babies born in quick succession, to a mother whose body \nhas not yet recovered from a previous birth, are the least likely to \nsurvive. Voluntary family planning programs seek to support child \nsurvival efforts, and help women understand the vital link between \nchild survival and family planning.\n  So as I noted in my earlier remarks, the House language will do \nnothing to prevent abortions in China or elsewhere. But it will prevent \nvital health services from being delivered to women and children in the \nworld's poorest nations.\n  I urge my colleagues to remember what is really at stake here. This \nis a public health issue, and an extremely serious one.\n  Family planning saves lives. Experts estimate that the lives of 5.6 \nmillion children and 200,000 women could be saved every year if all the \nwomen who wanted to limit their families had access to family planning.\n  I ask my colleagues to really think about those statistics--5.6 \nmillion children and 200,000 women each year.\n  So when we debate this issue of whether to support voluntary family \nplanning programs like UNFPA and others, let us keep this debate \nfocused squarely where it belongs--on the world's young women, who \nstruggle against impossible odds to better their lives, and who \ndesperately need reproductive health care services.\n  Let us keep this debate squarely focused on the young mothers around \nthe world, who have small children or babies and need family planning \nassistance to ensure that they do not become pregnant again too \nquickly--endangering their own lives and that of their babies and young \nchildren.\n  Let us keep this debate squarely focused on the thousands of women in \npoor nations who, lacking access to reproductive health care, resort to \nself-induced abortions and, too often, tragically lose their lives. \nExperts estimate that at least half a million women will die from \npregnancy-related causes, roughly 200,000 from illegal abortions which \nare prevented when women have family planning services.\n  The issues of refunding UNFPA and the Mexico City policy came before \nCongress again and again when Presidents Bush and Reagan were in \noffice. Congress repeatedly voted for the United States to resume UNFPA \nfunding, and to reject Mexico City-like restrictions on our family \nplanning program.\n  So let us move on to the task of ensuring that women in the \ndeveloping world have access to the kinds of reproductive health \nservices they deserve. Let us adopt the Leahy-Kassebaum amendment.\n  I yield back the floor.\n  Mr. LEAHY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, a number of Senators have spoken on this \nissue. And I also know that the Senate bipartisan leadership and the \nHouse bipartisan leadership are meeting with the President, so there \nwill not be a rollcall vote immediately.\n  I urge Senators who wish to speak on this subject to come to the \nfloor and speak. I see the distinguished Senator from California, and I \nask the Senator if she wishes to speak.\n  Mrs. BOXER. About 7 minutes.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Whatever time the Senator wants.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor so the distinguished Senator can, in \nher own right, have the floor.\n  Mrs. BOXER addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I am very pleased to rise in support of \nthe Leahy amendment. I think the Senate was right on this issue, and I \nthink the Senate should hold its ground. The Senator from Kansas, \nSenator Kassebaum, worked hard to write language that makes sense. \nSenator Leahy has worked with her.\n  We ought to be very clear in this body that we support family \nplanning, certainly we do not want to see abortion, and we are not \ngoing to cut the legs out from under agencies that work to prevent \nabortion, that work to make sure there is family planning all over the \nglobe.\n  These are nongovernmental entities that work hard to make sure that \noverpopulation is addressed by prevention. To punish--to punish--these \nnongovernmental entities in this bill, as the House wants to do, by \nrestricting their funding and holding them to a standard that really \nhas no rationale, to me, makes no sense. Then, of course, we have the \nattack on the U.N. Population Fund in this House amendment, which the \nLeahy-Kassebaum amendment would strike.\n  The United States was instrumental in creating the U.N. Population \nFund in 1969 and, until 1985, provided nearly 30 percent of its \nfunding. UNFPA is the largest internationally funded source of \npopulation assistance, directly managing one-third of the world's \npopulation assistance to developing countries. It is the principal \nmultilateral organization providing worldwide family planning and \npopulation assistance to developing countries. It operates in over 140 \ncountries in the poorest and the most remote regions of the world. \nNearly half of the UNFPA assistance is used for family planning \nservices and maternal and child health care. Another 18 percent is \nallocated for related population information, education, and \ncommunication.\n  I say to my friends who call themselves pro-life--and you have every \nright to call yourself whatever you want. And if that reflects your \nview on issues, fine. I feel I am for life, but I am pro-choice. And I \nfeel I am for life because I am pro-choice, because I want to make sure \nthat families have what they need to engage in sensible family planning \nso they are not faced with terrible choices.\n  Why on earth would the House of Representatives and some Members of \nthe Senate want to punish an organization that helps people with family \nplanning services, that educates them on how to prevent unwanted \npregnancy, how to prevent sexually transmitted diseases such as AIDS \nand others? Why would we want to punish those organizations?\n  Well, I think it is clear why. Because when you strip it all away, \nthere is punishment at work out here, punishment for organizations that \nbelieve it is very important to keep abortion safe and legal. And I do \nnot think it is the job of the U.S. Senate or the House of \nRepresentatives to lash out at these people who are working in the most \ndifficult conditions, in the most difficult areas of the world, and \npunish them for no other reason other than they believe, if abortion is \nlegal, let us make it safe. That is what this amendment would do.\n  The fund that the House of Representatives and the Republicans over \nthere want to stop provides support for population data collection and \nanalysis, demographic and socioeconomic research, and population policy \nformulation and evaluation.\n  What does that mean? It means that we need to know statistically what \nis \n\n[[Page S 16489]]\n\ngoing on in these countries. Is birth control working? Is family \nplanning working? How is the infant mortality rate connected with \nrunaway population growth? In 1993, UNFPA supported 1,560 projects in \n141 countries, including 44 countries in sub-Saharan Africa, 33 \ncountries in Latin America and the Caribbean, 39 countries in Asia and \nthe Pacific, 25 countries in the Arab States, and in Europe.\n  Already we have a prohibition on U.S. dollars; they cannot be used \nfor abortion. That is clear. And that has been in the law for a long \ntime. But this is that long arm reach of big brother and the Contract \nWith America that says, ``We are going to stop them from everything \nthat they are doing, including family planning, even if they use their \nown funds for abortion-related activities.''\n  I find it incredible, my friends, that the Republican-led Congress \nthat talks about States' rights and local control wants to take the \nlong arm of Uncle Sam and put it in the middle of these countries, into \nnongovernmental organizations that are out in the worst circumstances, \nin the worst poverty, and stop these organizations from doing their \ngood work by forcing them to say, ``You can never be involved, even \nwith your own funds, in abortion-related activities, even if abortion \nis legal in the country.''\n  UNFPA programs contribute to improving the quality and safety of \ncontraceptives, to reducing the incidence of abortion, and to improving \nreproductive health and strengthening the status of women. Well, I \nthink we ought to be applauding the UNFPA. I think we ought to be \napplauding the work of the U.N. Population Fund, not saying, ``We're \ngoing to take away your funding, nongovernmental organizations in other \ncountries, if you use your own funds to ensure that women get safe, \nlegal abortions.''\n  You know, I was around this country when abortion was illegal, and I \nwant to tell you what it was like because a lot of the younger people \ndo not remember it, and some of the older, older people are beginning \nto forget.\n  But what it was like is the following: Abortions were illegal, but \nwomen still, in certain dire circumstances, chose to get them. They \nrisked their lives. They had to go down back alleys. They had to beg, \nborrow, and steal the money. It was risky, and it was dangerous. \nHundreds of women died every year. I do not understand how someone can \ncall himself pro-life when they want to go back to those days.\n  Today we had a vote on the House side, an overwhelming vote, related \nto late-term abortions. To tell you how radical this group is over \nthere, they did not even make an exception for the life of the mother.\n  So I say to the men in this country, think about what it would be \nlike if your wife came home, they had found a cancer, she was in the \nmid-term of her pregnancy, and the doctor said, ``I cannot say that you \nwill not die if you go ahead with this birth,'' and you and your wife \nand your family had to face a horrible decision, a terrible, terrible \nchoice.\n  I ask you, why should Members of Congress climb into that living room \nwith you and tell you what to do with your family? I am revolted by it. \nI am disgusted by it. And I am stunned that a party that says, ``We \ndon't want to get in the middle of your life,'' would get right in the \nmiddle of your most personal decision.\n  What is going on here with the UNFPA is an outgrowth of that \nmentality. ``Oh, yeah, we want you to make your own decisions''--except \nif we disagree with it, then we are going to pass a law--``your most \nprivate, personal, difficult, agonizing choices that you should make as \na family.'' And now we are going to reach in to nongovernmental \norganizations that operate in Latin America, in Africa, in Europe, and \nwe are going to tell them as Members of Congress, because we are so \nimportant and we know so much about everything, that we are going to \ndeny them funding even with their own funds, with their own privately \nraised funds--not our funds--they help a woman with a safe and legal \nabortion, rather than force her into some back alley and some butcher's \nknife.\n\n  I hope the Senate stands tall on this amendment. It is very important \nthat we do. It is all interconnected. It is all about what we stand for \nas a nation. Do we stand for individual rights, or do we stand for Big \nBrother telling us how to make these private, agonizing, and difficult \nchoices?\n  Let me tell you what the House did today in their vote. They said if \nthere is a midterm or late abortion, it is illegal and the woman and \nthe doctor can go to jail. Oh, yeah, they can defend themselves. The \ndoctor can use as a defense, ``I thought her life would be \nthreatened,'' but there is no presumption that the doctor can make that \nruling, not even an exception for life of the mother.\n  In my opinion, what the House did today will lead to women dying if \nthis Senate does not stand up against it. I have to tell you, I will \nstand on this floor as long as it takes--and people know me, they know \nI will--to stop that kind of legislation from becoming the law of the \nland, to stop an attack on women.\n  I have not read on this floor some of these cases and the agony of \nthese cases where women are faced and their husbands are faced with the \nmost difficult decisions of their lives. I, frankly, was not elected to \nbe God, and I was not elected to be a doctor. They even made up a term \ncalled ``partial-birth abortions.'' There is no such scientific term. \nThey made it up just to try to incite people's emotions.\n  Let me tell you, they are going too far. They are radical, and they \nare going too far. Just like they are radical in their budget when they \ntake $270 billion out of Medicare and give a tax cut to the rich with \nit. Just like they are radical on their environmental policy where the \nRepublican study group put out a bulletin--I am going to put it in the \nRecord--that is a guide to Republicans in the House and says, ``Go home \nand plant a tree and visit your zoo and then they can never say you are \nagainst the environment.'' Go home and plant a tree and visit your zoo \nand give a report card out to the best environmentals and then, yes, \nyou can vote against the Clean Air Act, the wetlands, forget the \nEndangered Species Act. Who needs the bald eagle anyway?\n  Well, it is a radical crowd. They have gone too far, and this is an \nexample, UNFPA, an organization that does so much good out there.\n  UNFPA helps to promote male participation and responsibility in \nfamily planning programs; address adolescent reproductive health; reach \nisolated rural areas with high demands for family planning services.\n  They want you to believe in this amendment that it is about China. \nLet me be very clear. No United States funds made available to the \nUNFPA shall be made available for any activities in the People's \nRepublic of China. Our funds are not being used for any activities in \nChina. I do not want them to go to China because they have a policy, we \nknow, that we do not agree with: forced abortion, particularly as it \nrelates to females.\n  So the bottom line is, none of us is for that, but this has nothing \nto do with this amendment. UNFPA United States funds do not go to China \nand will never go to China. It is a back-door way to hurt a very \nimportant program. It is about ending the U.S. participation in the \nU.N. family planning fund where we have been active since the sixties, \nand we should be proud of our activities there, because we are saving \nlives, we are giving health care to people who need it desperately, and \nwe are not controlling the way people think. Why should we? It is their \nright in their country to support safe, legal abortions if they want. \nWe should not try to gag them as a result of our participation in \nUNFPA.\n  So I hope the American people follow this debate, because there is a \nlinkage here to what has gone on in the House today, their attack on a \nwoman's right to choose. They basically ended Roe versus Wade today, \nbecause Roe versus Wade said, in the late terms of a pregnancy, after \nthe first trimester, the State shall regulate. They stepped in and took \nover and reached the long arm of Uncle Sam into every doctor's office \nin America, disrespecting women, disrespecting families, disrespecting \nindividual rights, disrespecting physicians.\n  They have gone too far, and now in this bill we face this fight. I \nhope that my colleagues will support the Leahy-Kassebaum language. It \nis the language we all agree with. We are not saying in \n\n[[Page S 16490]]\n\nany way in this bill that Federal funds are going to be used in any way \nfor abortion, but what we are saying with this amendment is that \nnongovernmental organizations--nongovernmental organizations--operating \nin other countries have a right to do what they will with their own \nfunds.\n  As far as UNFPA, they are using this China argument and distorting \nit. They just want to get us to pull out of this family planning, this \nvery important agency. I hope we will support Patrick Leahy on this \none.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the think-globally-act-locally House \nRepublican Agenda be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n Think Globally, Act Locally--A Pro-Active, Pro-Environment Agenda for \n                           House Republicans\n\n\n                              introduction\n\n       As we all know, the environmentalist lobby and their \n     extremist friends in the eco-terrorist underworld have been \n     working overtime to define Republicans and their agenda as \n     anti-environment, pro-polluter, and hostile to the survival \n     of every cuddly critter roaming God's green earth.\n       While we all know that this characterization of Republicans \n     is far from true, it will continue to be the drumbeat message \n     of the left for as long as it helps them a) grab headlines, \n     b) write fundraising letters, and c) energize people who \n     consider themselves pro-environment.\n       The new Republican Congress is committed to updating \n     environmental legislation written in the 1960s and 1970s to \n     better address the problems of the 1990s and for the century \n     to come. As we move this agenda based on sound science, \n     results and real clean-up, better use of tax dollars, respect \n     for property rights, and less reliance on lawyers, the \n     establishment environmentalist community in Washington has \n     begun its own fear campaign to preserve the status quo they \n     make a living from.\n       Although Republicans and the vast majority of the American \n     people believe you can't have a strong economy without a \n     strong environment, and you can't have a strong environment \n     without a strong economy, the extremist environmental \n     movement will stop at nothing to distort the facts, lie about \n     our legislative agenda, and paint you and your fellow \n     Republicans as the insensitive extremists in this fight. And \n     while we will never satisfy the most extreme in the \n     environmental movement, to many in our growing Republican \n     majority--especially suburban women and young people--the \n     environment is an important issue.\n       In addition to the legislative battle the Conference will \n     help you fight, and win, here in Washington to bring common \n     sense reforms to environmental legislation such as the \n     Endangered Species Act, Superfund, and Clean Water \n     legislation, there are very real and very effective steps you \n     can take in your districts to help further insulate yourself \n     from the attacks of the green extremists.\n       As we are ``thinking globally'' about how to improve our \n     nation's environmental laws here in Congress, the steps \n     listed below will help you to ``act locally'' and get \n     involved in your districts on the side of a cleaner \n     environment.\n       By taking some time to get involved in a variety of pro-\n     environment projects in your communities, you can go over the \n     heads of the elitist environmental movement and work directly \n     with the people who care most about the environment in your \n     communities--your constituents.\n       The time to act is now. In order to build credibility you \n     must engage this agenda before your opponents can label your \n     efforts ``craven, election year gimmicks.'' Remember, as a \n     famous frog once said, ``it ain't easy being green,'' your \n     constituents will give you more credit for showing up on a \n     Saturday to help clean up the local park or beach than they \n     will give a press release from some Washington-based special \n     interest group.\n       Think of it this way, the next time Bruce Babbit comes to \n     your district and canoes down a river as a media stunt to \n     tell the press how anti-environment their congressman is, if \n     reporters have been to your boss' adopt-a-highway clean-up, \n     two of his tree plantings, and his Congressional Task Force \n     on Conservation hearings, they'll just laugh Babbit back to \n     Washington.\n\n\n                              Action Items\n\n                            I. Tree planting\n\n       Whether sponsoring tree planting programs in your district \n     or participating in ongoing tree planting programs, this \n     exercise provides Members with excellent earned media \n     opportunities. When participating in tree planting programs \n     you should include both children and seniors. In addition, \n     while it is important to discuss the positive environmental \n     aspects of planting trees, don't forget the symbolism that \n     trees represent--i.e. roots in the community, family, and \n     district.\n       Tree planting can occur at schools, parks, public \n     buildings, and even senior centers. If the Member plans on \n     sponsoring his/her own tree planting program, consider, \n     contacting local nurseries who may donate trees for the \n     cause. (Contact the ethics committee prior to undertaking \n     this activity)\n\n         II. Special environmental days--Earth Day & Arbor Day\n\n       During the year there are at least two days when the \n     ``environment'' is a major news story.\n       Earth Day--Usually third week in April.\n       Arbor Day--Proposed in 1996 for April 26th.\n       During these special environmental days, chances are good \n     that the media will be writing an Earth Day or an Arbor Day \n     story. In addition, chances are also good that somewhere in \n     your district there will be a group sponsoring an event. Plan \n     on participating in these events, or at a minimum, plan on \n     releasing a statement of support. In your statement of \n     support, make sure to include your positive environmental \n     activities.\n\n            III. Adopt a highway, walking trail or bike path\n\n       While traveling your district, you will no doubt come \n     across ``Adopt a Highway'' signs. This is an excellent \n     program that embodies the Republican philosophy of \n     volunteerism. To participate in this program you should \n     contact your state, county road commission, or local roadway \n     authorities.\n       In addition to participating in an ``Adopt a Highway'' \n     program, you may also want to participate or initiate an \n     ``Adopt a Walking Trail'' program or ``Adopt a Bike Path'' \n     program. For these type of programs you should contact your \n     local, county, or state parks authorities.\n       Once you decide to participate in any of these programs, \n     make sure to announce your participation at the site. Stress \n     community involvement in your remarks and have plenty of \n     supporters on cite at the press conference.\n\n                      IV. Environmental companies\n\n       Environmental high tech ``clean up related'' companies or \n     companies that produce products from recycled materials are \n     among the fastest growing industries in America. Through your \n     local Chamber of Commerce or National Federation of \n     Independent Businesses, do some investigative work to seek \n     out environmental related companies in your district. If you \n     have an environmental company in your district, contact the \n     facility and arrange for a tour.\n       During the tour be sure to invite the media to participate \n     (make sure you receive permission from the facility). Become \n     briefed on the company's mission and offer your support. \n     Chances are, the company will be happy to participate in this \n     earned media opportunity which offers them positive media \n     coverage.\n\n                   V. Start a conservation task force\n\n       One of the best ways to keep informed regarding local \n     environmental issues is to organize a local conservation task \n     force in your district. In addition to keeping you informed \n     on local environmental issues, this group can also assist you \n     in developing an environmental legislative agenda. To set up \n     such a group invite local environmentalists and sportsmen to \n     join. Groups to contact include: garden club members, 4H \n     representatives, Ducks Unlimited members, Audobon members, \n     and other local or grass-roots organizations that are \n     symphathetic to your common sense environmental agenda.\n\n                VI. Local conservation groups and boards\n\n       What types of environmental groups are already active in \n     your district? Look for zoo boards, garden clubs, or other \n     community conservation/environmental groups in your district. \n     Become an active board member where possible.\n\n                    VII. Local school participation\n\n       Many school curriculums include environmental issues or \n     offer special environmental programs. Find out which schools \n     offer these programs and become a guest lecturer. In your \n     lecture be prepared to offer congressional environmental \n     action highlights as well as a reaffirmation of your \n     commitment to a clean environment.\n\n                   VIII. Constituent letter data base\n\n       Undoubtedly, your office has received environmental related \n     constituents letters. Hopefully, you have coded these letters \n     in your data base. These are constituents who care enough \n     about the environment to take the time to write you and in \n     many cases will appreciate updates from you concerning your \n     environmental agenda. These are also the same people that you \n     can ask to participate in your conservation task force.\n\nIX. Using recycled materials & initiating a recycling program in office\n\n       One of the best ways to show your concern about the \n     environment is to lead by example. One way to show this is to \n     announce an office policy which includes purchasing recycled \n     materials and initiating a recycling program in your office. \n     When announcing this new office policy be sure to include \n     local environmentalists who will praise your actions.\n\n                  X. Recycling facilities in district\n\n       Many municipalities and counties have ongoing recycling \n     programs. Seek out those who have these programs and tour the \n     facility or drop off area. If they don't currently have \n     recycling programs, you might want to head up a task force \n     with local officials to implement a municipal or county wide \n     program.\n\n                 XI. Teddy Roosevelt conservation award\n\n       Through his conservation efforts President Teddy Roosevelt \n     is probably known as the Republican's most famous \n     environmentalist. Using his name, consider establishing a \n     yearly ``Teddy Roosevelt Conservation Award'' \n\n[[Page S 16491]]\n\n     for someone in your district whose achievements exemplify \n     President Roosevelt's conservation commitment. You can even \n     recognize several award winners by establishing a youth \n     award, a senior award, or a local business conservation \n     award.\n       Be sure to contact your local media when you establish the \n     award and when you award the winner. To facilitate the \n     process of identifying potential winners. You can involve \n     your local conservation task force and local schools in the \n     decision process.\n\n                        XII. Environmental PSAs\n\n       Members of Congress are important leaders. As such it is \n     both appropriate and encouraged that you speak out on local \n     environmental issues through the use of public service \n     announcements (PSAs).\n       Suggested environmental PSAs could include:\n       Proper battery disposal.\n       Encouraging recycling at home.\n       Proper motor oil disposal when changing your car's oil.\n       Encouraging respect for nature when camping or hunting.\n       Keeping lakes, rivers, and beaches clean by putting garbage \n     in its place.\n       These PSAs can air on both radio and cable stations. To \n     produce a PSA first contact your local radio and cable \n     stations to inquire if they will run your PSA. When producing \n     PSAs, you can use studios at the radio and cable station or \n     you can use the House Recording Studio.\n\n              XIII. Door to door-handing out tree saplings\n\n       If your current plans include door to door, consider \n     passing out tree saplings with your door to door pamphlet. \n     Some Members even design the pamphlet so that it is attached \n     to the tree sapling.\n       This practice demonstrates your commitment to the \n     environment by encouraging the planting of the trees and it \n     provides you with an opportunity to use appropriate language \n     tying your legislative agenda to the ``roots'' you are \n     establishing or growing in your community.\n\n               XIV. River, lake, beach, or park clean ups\n\n       Through your conservation task force or through already \n     established organizations, consider participating in local \n     river, lake, beach, or park clean ups. Participating in these \n     events will provide you with an opportunity to gain positive \n     media exposure and further demonstrates your commitment to \n     the environment.\n\n                             XV. Local zoo\n\n       Become active in your local zoo. Go for a visit, \n     participate in fundraising events, become active on its \n     citizens advisory board, or help create enthusiasm for \n     special projects it might be promoting.\n\n\n                               conclusion\n\n       Remember, the environment must be a proactive issue. \n     Congressional staff in both the Washington office and the \n     district office need to concentrate on seeking out \n     environmental opportunities for their boss. Republicans \n     should not be afraid of the environmental extremists--embrace \n     our record and act to promote it.\n\n  Mr. SPECTER addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I support the amendment offered by the \ndistinguished Senator from Kansas, Senator Kassebaum, and supported by \nothers, Senator Leahy and Senator Boxer as well.\n  It seems to me a fundamental proposition that a private organization \nought to be able to use its funds overseas for any purpose which it \nchooses. The Kassebaum amendment provides that there will be no U.S. \ndollars used to pay for abortion, and, in my view, that ought to take \ncare of the objection of anybody who does not want to have U.S. \ntaxpayer dollars spent on abortions.\n  But the factor of not limiting a private organization to a standard \nwhich is different than the laws of the host country seems to me to be \nfundamental. Were these moneys to be spent in another country, let the \nlaws of those countries determine what is appropriate. To try to impose \na limitation under the so-called Mexico City policy, the House \nlanguage, which would prohibit United States dollars to organizations \nwhich are bilateral or multilateral, where those organizations use \ntheir own funds for whatever purposes, including abortion, seems to me \nto be a matter which is really within the purview of those private \norganizations. What concerns me, Mr. President, is that this \ncontroversy is part of a broader controversy which has engulfed the \nU.S. Senate and the House on the confirmation of Dr. Henry Foster, \nwhere he was not even given a vote on confirmation in the Senate \nbecause he performed medical procedures--abortions--permitted by the \nU.S. Constitution; a debate on an appropriations bill about whether \nwomen in prison would be able to have abortions at public expense, \nwhere they were necessary, in the judgment of the doctor, for medical \npurposes or where that woman might have been a victim of incest; even \nunder the restrictive language of limiting the language of abortion to \nincest, rape, or the life of the mother. It is not just whether funds \nought to be available if a woman in a Federal prison is unable to earn \nany money or to take care of her own medical needs, and she is denied a \nmedical procedure--an abortion--if she is the victim of incest, or the \nissue about having medical procedures--abortions--available for women \nin overseas medical installations.\n  There is really a broad scale attack on a woman's right to choose, a \nconstitutional right that is recognized by the Constitution of the \nUnited States, as interpreted by the Supreme Court of the United \nStates--not going back to Roe versus Wade in 1973, but a decision \nhanded down in Casey versus Planned Parenthood by the Supreme Court in \n1992, an opinion written by three Justices appointed by Republican \nPresidents, Reagan and Bush, an opinion written by Justices Souter, \nO'Connor, and Anthony Kennedy.\n  So I hope that we will not further limit the right of a private \norganization to use their own funds for overseas purposes, even if they \ninclude abortion, simply because that U.S. organization may have U.S. \nfunds for totally separate and collateral purposes.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/11/01/senate-section/article/S16473-1", "month": "11", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "01", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S16491-S16492]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       MILITARY ACTION IN BOSNIA\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, this is a subject which has been spoken \nabout on our floor and has been the subject of action by the House--\nthat is, the subject of not having military action in Bosnia, which \nutilizes United States troops without prior consent by the Congress of \nthe United States. This is a very, very important subject, Mr. \nPresident, for many reasons.\n  We have learned from the bitter experience of Vietnam that the United \nStates cannot successfully wage a war which does not have public \nbacking, and the first indicia of public backing is approval by the \nCongress of the United States.\n  We have deviated from the constitutional requirement that only the \nCongress can declare war. In Korea, we had a conflict, a war without a \ndeclaration of war and, again, in Vietnam. When a Republican President, \nPresident George Bush, wanted to act under Presidential authority to \nmove into the gulf with military action, I was one of many Senators who \nstood on this floor and objected to that, because it was a matter that \nought to have been initiated only with congressional action.\n  Finally, in January 1991, in a historic debate on this floor, the \nCongress of the United States authorized the use of force, and I \nsupported that policy for the use of force. But the more important \nprinciple involved was that the President could not act unilaterally, \ncould not act on his own.\n  Similarly, I think that is a mandatory consideration on the Bosnian \nsituation. I have disagreed--many of us have--with the President's \npolicy in Bosnia. On this floor, I have said on a number of occasions, \nas have others, that the arms embargo against the Bosnian Moslems was \nbad public policy, that the Bosnian Moslems ought to be able to defend \nthemselves against Serbian atrocities.\n  After the Senate voted overwhelmingly to lift that embargo, and the \nHouse voted overwhelmingly to lift that embargo, only then did the \nPresident become involved in the Bosnian situation and effectuated a \npolicy of United States airstrikes. And I, among many others, argued \nwith the administration and the military leaders that we should have \nundertaken airstrikes to use U.S. military power in a way which did not \nput large numbers of our troops at risk.\n  We were told by the administration and by military leaders that air \npower without ground support would be ineffective. But, finally, when \nthe administration was faced with no alternative, except to face a \npossible override on their veto of the legislation lifting the arms \nembargo, then, and only then, was air power employed, and very, very \neffectively. I believe that the use of U.S. air power is entirely \nappropriate, but the use of ground forces is not.\n  We have seen the policy in Somalia, where this administration went \nbeyond \n\n[[Page S 16492]]\n\nhumanitarian purposes to nation building. It was up to the Congress of \nthe United States to withhold funding. That might be necessary again, \nin a very unsatisfactory way, to have the constitutional mandate that \nonly the Congress can declare war, enforced through the congressional \npower of the appropriations process. It is most unsatisfactory to have \na Presidential commitment and to have U.S. troops involved and then to \nhave it terminated only by the withholding of funds.\n  So it is my hope, Mr. President, that President Clinton will not act \nunilaterally, as he did in Haiti, against the overwhelming sense of the \nSenate and sense of the House that there not be an invasion of Haiti. \nFortunately, it was done without bloodshed. But this is a \nconstitutional issue of the highest import. If the President wishes to \nexercise the use of force in Bosnia, he ought to follow the \nconstitutional doctrine, the precedent of the gulf war, and he ought to \ncome to Congress for authorization. Then, and only then, will there be \nan appropriate opportunity to debate the matter and for Congress to \nexercise its will under the Constitution.\n  On the state of the record, my view is that there ought not to be an \nAmerican commitment of troops. But, certainly, that ought not to be \ndone by the President unilaterally. The matter ought to come before the \nCongress, and it ought to be a congressional decision one way or \nanother, under the constitutional provision that only the Congress has \nthe authority to declare war.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/11/01/senate-section/article/S16491-1", "month": "11", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "01", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S16492-S16495]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n      FOREIGN OPERATIONS, EXPORT FINANCING, AND RELATED PROGRAMS \n                 APPROPRIATIONS ACT--CONFERENCE REPORT\n\n  The Senate continued with the consideration of the conference report.\n  Mr. SIMPSON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming is recognized.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3041\n\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. President, I ask that I be added as a cosponsor of \nthe Leahy-Kassebaum amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. President, I want to show my support for this \namendment, which, of course, includes U.S. funding for the U.N. \nPopulation Fund, UNFPA, as it is known. President Clinton had to resume \nfunding for the population fund 2 years ago after a 7-year suspension \nduring the Reagan and Bush administrations. I did not ascribe to that. \nI did not agree with the fine Presidents of my own party on that \nissue--either the wonderful Ronald Reagan or my fine, loyal friend, \nGeorge Bush.\n  Last year, the Congress appropriated $40 million for the fund, and \n$50 million was appropriated for 1995. This year, we are looking at \nfunding levels of $35 million.\n  I do understand that funding for all programs across the board needs \nto be reduced if we are to incur savings in this year's budget bill. \nHowever, I do not want to see population programs unfairly targeted for \nlarger reductions than other foreign assistance programs.\n  The United States needs to keep its funding at an adequate level, or \nwe will surely send exactly the wrong message to the rest of the \ndeveloped nations across the world. Last year, the United States was \nseen as a world's leader of population and development assistance at \nthe International Conference on Population and Development in Cairo. I \nwas a congressional delegate at the conference, as was my friend, \nSenator John Kerry. There were not a lot of colleagues eager or seeking \nto go to that particular conference. I came away very impressed with \nthe leadership and direction displayed there by Vice President \nGore, and the assistance given him by the now Under Secretary of State, \nformer Senator, Tim Wirth in guiding the conference and its delegates \nin developing a ``consensus document,'' on a broad range of short- and \nlong-term recommendations concerning maternal and child health care, \nstrengthening family planning programs, the promotion of educational \nopportunities for girls and women, and improving status and rights of \nwomen across the world.\n\n  We surely do not want to lose our moral leadership role and \nrelinquish any momentum by abandoning or severely weakening our \nfinancial commitment to population and development assistance. The \nUnited States needs to continue its global efforts to achieve \nresponsible and sustainable population levels, and to back that up with \nleadership with specific commitments to population planning activities.\n  In my mind, of all of the challenges facing this country--and there \nare surely plenty of them--and around the world--none compares to that \nof the increasing of the population growth of the world. All of our \nefforts to protect the environment, all the things we hear about what \nis going to happen, what will happen to this forest system, or this \necosystem, promoting economic development, jobs for those around the \nworld, are compromised and severely injured by the staggering growth in \nthe world's population.\n  I hope my colleagues realize, of course, that there are currently 5.7 \nbillion people on the Earth. In 1950, when I was a freshman at the \nUniversity of Wyoming--not that long ago, surely--there were 2.5 \nbillion people on the face of the Earth. Mr. President, 2.5 billion \npeople using the Earth's surface for sustenance and procreation in \n1950. Today, 5.7 billion--double--more than double.\n   Since 1950 to today, the figure has doubled and it will double again \nif birth and death rates continue. The world's population will double \nagain in 40 years. These are huge figures.\n  If you want to talk about food supply, want to talk about the \nenvironment, pollution, fish, timber, coal, resources, there is your \nfigure. Nobody pays much attention to that because we allow this debate \nto slip over to abortion. It does not have anything to do with abortion \nor coercive practices.\n  That is why it is so important we show our support by funding this \nparticular fund. It is supported entirely by voluntary contributions, \nnot by the U.N. regular budget.\n  You do not have to get into this one because you hate the United \nNations either. This is not about whether you like the United Nations \nor not. Many of us have great problems with the United Nations, and \nthey have certainly failed in many endeavors, but this is not a ``U.N. \ncaper.''\n  There were 88 donors to the fund in 1994, most of which were \ndeveloping nations. Japan and the United States were the leading \ncontributors to the fund with the Nordic countries not lagging far \nbehind.\n  UNFPA assistance goes to support 150 countries and territories across \nthe world. UNFPA total income in 1994 was $265.3 million, and it \nprovides about one-fourth of the world's population assistance to all \ndeveloping countries.\n  I think it would be a real shame if the United States were to back \naway from its commitment to the world's largest source of multilateral \nassistance for population programs.\n  I want to reiterate again what has been said already about U.S. \nparticipation in this fund. The U.S. contribution would be subject to \nall the restrictions which have been in place for many years. These \nrestrictions are in place to address concerns specifically about U.S. \nfunds being spent in China. I hear those concerns.\n  Under current appropriations law, foreign aid funding is denied to \nany organization or program that ``supports or participates in the \nmanagement of a program of coerced abortion or involuntary \nsterilization'' in any country. That is pretty clear. I agree with \nthat.\n  Furthermore, current appropriations law ensures that none of the \nUnited States contribution to UNFPA may be used in China--none. Listen \ncarefully: The United States is not funding any of the population \nactivities in China.\n  Furthermore, the U.N. Population Fund does not fund abortions or \nsupport coercive activities in any country including China. The UNFPA \nassistance goes toward family planning services and maternal and child \nhealth care across the developing world.\n  Finally, no U.S. funds may be commingled with other UNFPA funds and \nnumerous penalties exist in law for any violation of this requirement.\n  I also have deep and serious concerns about China's coerced abortion \npolicy, but forcing the U.N. Population Fund to withdraw from China \nwill not affect that policy one whit. In fact, without \n\n[[Page S 16493]]\n\nthe careful monitoring that the fund performs, conditions in China \nwould get very much worse. That is an important consideration. The \nworld and the United States cannot turn its back on what is currently \ngoing on in China. Remove the funding and that great door will close \never further. No one will be able to participate or to change those \npolicies.\n  Finally, this amendment would strike the House Mexico City language \nthat denies United States population assistance to groups that are \ninvolved in dialog with foreign governments about abortion policy or \neven distribute literature on preventing unsafe abortions. This House \namendment would ultimately deny family planning activities overseas. \nSince the House language applies to nongovernment organizations [NGO's] \nit would cut off funds to the most effective and dedicated providers of \nservices, groups that best understand the needs of the people in the \ncountry they serve.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote for the Leahy-Kassebaum amendment so \nthat the United States might continue its leadership role in addressing \nthe global population issues which are wholly significant in the range \nof other issues that we confront from day-to-day, because all of it \ncomes back to the simple fact, how many footprints will fit on the face \nof the Earth?\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Thompson). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Abraham). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, for the information of all Senators, \nSenator Nickles is going to speak for a few moments and then we are \nprepared to vote. It is my understanding that if the Leahy amendment is \nagreed to, that will be the last vote of the evening.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to Senator Leahy's \namendment. I will read it for my colleagues' information:\n\n       Provided, That in determining eligibility for assistance \n     from funds appropriated to carry out section 104 of the \n     Foreign Assistance Act of 1961, nongovernmental and \n     multilateral organizations shall not be subjected to \n     requirements more restrictive than requirements applicable to \n     foreign governments for such assistance: Provided further, \n     That none of the funds made available under this Act may be \n     used to lobby for or against abortion.\n\n  It sounds kind of reasonable, until you realize we do not have \nrestrictions on governments dealing with the prohibition of abortion. \nSo this language is meaningless. It has no restriction whatsoever. That \nmeans that we would be funding international family planning groups \nthat use abortion as a method of family planning. A lot of us really do \nnot want to do that. It is troublesome to think that international \ngroups, some of which support abortion as a method of family planning, \nwould be receiving tax dollars to be used in that fashion. Maybe this \namendment is a nice attempt to cover that up, as a substitute for the \nHouse language. I just hope that our colleagues will not agree to it, \nfor a lot of different reasons.\n  One, I do not think we want to fund international groups that promote \nor support or fund abortions. I do not think U.S. taxpayers' dollars \nshould be used for that purpose. We have restrictions in this country. \nWe have restrictions in this country that prohibit the use of \ntaxpayers' dollars to be used to fund abortions, except in necessary \ncases--to save the life of the mother, or in cases of rape or incest. \nThat is really what the House language is trying to do.\n  The House language reinstates the so-called Mexico City policy, and \nit goes back to 1984 through January 1993, which includes the Reagan \nand Bush era. It says we do not want to fund international groups that \nsupport or fund abortion. That was the policy of this country for that \nperiod of time.\n  The Clinton administration, through an Executive order in January \n1993, reversed that policy. So now we have a policy, and Tim Wirth who \nserved in this body has been actively promoting it, where we actually \nhave been involved in encouraging countries to change their laws on \nabortion. I think 95 countries have significant restrictions in their \nlaws against abortion.\n  I think using U.S. taxpayers' funds to be telling other countries to \nchange their laws is very offensive. Certainly to be contributing to \norganizations that use part of their money or some of their moneys for \nabortions is also offensive.\n  Again, our stated policy in this country is we do not want to support \nabortion. We do not want taxpayers' moneys used to subsidize abortion \nunless it is necessary to save the life of mother or in cases of rape \nor incest. To be giving money to international organizations that \neither support or use abortions as a method of family planning or to \ntry to change Government laws for abortion, in my opinion, is wrong.\n  I looked at the House language and it basically says that money will \nnot be used for organizations, nongovernmental or multilateral \norganizations, until the organization certifies it will not, during the \nperiod for which the funds are made available, perform abortions in any \nforeign country except if the life of the mother were in danger if the \nfetus were carried to term, or in cases of forcible rape or incest.\n  I think that is good language. I think that language mirrors the \nlanguage that we have agreed to on this floor dealing with Labor-HHS, \nthe so-called Hyde language. Why in the world would we be supporting \nand giving money to foreign organizations that do the opposite? I think \nthat is a serious, serious mistake.\n  Also, I might mention this House language says that we do not want \nany money to be used to violate the laws of any foreign country \nconcerning circumstances under which abortion is permitted, regulated \nor prohibited. We do not want U.S. taxpayers' dollars used to go into \nother countries to lobby, to encourage, to change laws that they may \nhave dealing with abortion. Why in the world should we have the idea \nthat we know best, and so we want to manipulate and make those laws \nbasically more pro-abortion.\n  I want to touch for a second on the issue of the People's Republic of \nChina. There had been restrictions under the Reagan and Bush eras that \nwe did not give money to the UNFPA organization if they were giving \nmoney to the People's Republic of China, because they had a coercive \nabortion policy. The House language, likewise, says we would not give \nmoney to the U.N. family planning organization if they were still \nsupporting the coercive policies or contributing to the policies in the \nPeople's Republic of China.\n  Mr. President, I remember when Mrs. Clinton addressed a large \nconference in Beijing earlier this year and she condemned forced \nabortion. Unfortunately, that happens to be the policy in the People's \nRepublic of China today--a one-child policy, enforced by, in some \ncases, coercive abortion. That is unbelievable. It is also undeniable. \nYet UNFPA has actually made supportive comments about some of the \nthings that are going on in the PRC today concerning their family \nplanning efforts.\n  It is reprehensible to think that we might be contributing to an \norganization that might be assisting in coercive abortion. That should \nnot happen.\n  Mr. President, I look at the language that we have before the Senate \nin the so-called Leahy language. I do not find it acceptable. I find no \nrestriction whatever on U.S. funds to international organizations, no \nrestriction whatever. If it passes and if it became law, we will be \ngiving money to international groups that use abortion as a method of \nfamily planning.\n  That is offensive to me as a taxpayer. It is offensive to me to think \nthat the result of that is that U.S. tax dollars will be used in some \nway or another to subsidize the destruction of innocent, unborn human \nbeings.\n  I look at the House language. The House language is basically \nreinstating the policy that we had from 1984 to January  1993.  That  \npolicy  saved \n\n[[Page S 16494]]\n\nlives. Did it restrict use of family planning? No. Did family planning \ncontinue? Yes. Did family planning continue with funding from the \nUnited States? Yes.\n  Over 350 organizations signed up and said, ``We will take your money \nand use it for family planning, but we will not use abortion as a \nmethod of family planning.'' That means organizations all across the \nworld. It worked. Some people said they would not sign up, but they \ndid.\n  So we had family planning efforts, but we had family planning efforts \nseparate from abortion. That is what we are trying to do with this \nHouse language.\n  I urge our colleagues to reject the Leahy amendment and support the \nHouse language.\n  I might mention, also, I think that the House language, which passed \noverwhelmingly, passed by a vote of 232-187. My guess is that if we do \nnot have language similar to that, we will not have a bill. We will be \nlooking at the foreign operations bill in a continuing resolution, in \nall likelihood, throughout the year.\n  Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on the Leahy \namendment. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, very briefly, with all due respect to my \nfriend from Oklahoma, his description of the Leahy-Kassebaum amendment \nis not accurate.\n  Mr. President, we debated the basic aspects of the Leahy-Kassebaum \namendment less than a month ago. Mr. President, 57 Senators voted \nagainst what is in the House position, voted against the position we \nseek to replace. Nothing has changed since then.\n  The Leahy-Kassebaum amendment simply says that private family \nplanning organizations like the foreign organizations supported by the \nInternational Planned Parenthood Federation should not be restricted to \nrequire more subjective requirements, more restrictive than those \napplicable to Government.\n  In other words, it permits us to support private organizations, \nprovided U.S. Government funds are not used, are not used for abortion \nactivities as we made funds available for family planning to \ngovernments in countries where abortion is legal, as it is in this \ncountry, just as we give foreign aid to countries where abortion is \nlegal, as it is in this country.\n  This bill contains the same explicit prohibition of funding for \nabortion that has been the law for years. Not one dime in this bill \ncould be spent on abortion or anything related to abortion. The bill \nalready contains a prohibition against using any United States funds in \nChina.\n  The House amendment would, nevertheless, prohibit a U.S. contribution \nto the U.N. population fund. I think that would be foolhardy. The \nquestion is whether we should accept the House position so that the \nbill might go forward.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a statement of administration policy \nfrom OMB be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                          Office of the President,\n\n\n                              Office of Management and Budget,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, October 31, 1995.\n     Re H.R. 1868--Foreign operations, export financing and \n         related programs appropriations bill, FY 1996 (Sponsors: \n         Livingston, Louisiana; Callahan, Alabama).\n\n                   Statement of Administration Policy\n\n    [This statement has been coordinated by OMB with the concerned \n                               agencies]\n\n       This Statement of Administration Policy provides the \n     Administration's views on the item reported in disagreement \n     by the conference on H.R. 1868, the Foreign Operations, \n     Export Financing, and Related Programs Appropriations Bill, \n     FY 1996. Your consideration of the Administration's views \n     would be appreciated.\n       The conferees have reported in disagreement provisions \n     related to population assistance to non-governmental \n     organizations. This is an issue of the highest importance to \n     the Administration.\n       The Administration opposes coercion in family planning \n     practices, and no U.S. assistance is used to pay for abortion \n     as a method of family planning. The House provision, however, \n     would prohibit any assistance from being provided to entities \n     that fund abortions or lobby for abortions with private \n     funds, thus ending U.S. support for many qualified and \n     experienced non-governmental organizations providing vital \n     voluntary family planning information and services. The \n     provision would also end U.S. support for the United Nations \n     Population Fund (UNFPA). This would sharply limit the \n     availability of effective voluntary family planning programs \n     abroad that are designed to reduce the incidence of unwanted \n     pregnancy and thereby decrease the need for abortion. The \n     Administration also has serious concerns about the \n     constitutionality of the House provision. If the House \n     language were included in the bill presented to the \n     President, the Secretary of State would recommend to the \n     President that he veto the bill.\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. I read the last sentence: ``If the House language were \nincluded in the bill presented to the President, the Secretary of State \nwould recommend to the President he veto the bill.''\n  I think, Mr. President, we have heard debate for and against the \nLeahy-Kassebaum amendment. I know Senators are concerned about their \nschedule, and I am happy to go forward with a vote.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. I would like to thank the chairman for his leadership \nin crafting this foreign operation conference report. In light of the \nbudgetary restriction placed upon all of these projects, I think the \nchairman has done a skillful job of handling many divergent interests.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. I would also like to thank the Senator for his \nassistance in attempting to remedy funding difficulties we have \nexperienced for International Narcotics Control. As the chairman knows, \nI am extremely concerned that funding for U.S. drug interdiction \nefforts has been drastically declining since 1992. During this time we \nhave witnessed a proportionate increase in the use of drugs in America. \nFor example:\n  After a steep drop in monthly cocaine use between 1988 and 1991 from \n2.9 to 1.3 million users, and a similar drop in overall drug use \nbetween 1991 and 1992, from 14.5 to 11.4 million users, numbers \nreleased earlier this year revealed that youth drug use increased in \n1994, for all surveyed grades for crack, cocaine, heroin, LSD, non-LSD \nhallucinogens, inhalants, and mari- juana.\n  According to the Department of Health and Human Services, illegal \ndrug use among the Nation's high school seniors has risen 44.6 percent \nin the last 2 years.\n  The resurgence of heroin in the United States borders on epidemic \nproportions. DEA Administrator Thomas Constantine recently noted that \nheroin is now available in more cities at lower prices and higher \npurities than ever before in our history. In addition, Administrator \nConstantine says: ``For the first time in our history, America's crime \nproblem is being controlled by worldwide drug syndicates who operate \ntheir networks from places like Cali, Colombia * * *.''\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I am in complete agreement with my colleague from \nGeorgia, that we are at a crucial point in our war on drugs. Without \nthe immediate commitment of resources to stop the flow of illegal \nnarcotics across our borders, the United States will be facing the \nlargest expansion of illicit drug supplies and the greatest increase in \ndrug use in modern American history.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. The chairman has clearly summarized the problem that \nthe Senate attempted to address by increasing funding for international \ndrug control in the foreign operations appropriations bill. I know the \nchairman shares my concern that the conference report before us today \nseverely undermines the Senate's commitment to drug interdiction by \ndecreasing the direct funding from $150 to $115 million and replacing \nthe $20 million mandatory transfer of funds with language merely \nallowing the transfer of funds from ``Development Assistance'' and/or \nthe ``Economic Support Fund'' to ``International Narcotics Control.''\n  Mr. McCONNELL. The Senator from Georgia is correct. It is my \nunderstanding, however, that the conference committee fully intended \nthat the identified $20 million be transferred to International \nNarcotics Control.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. I appreciate the chairman's clarification and would \nask if the chairman would be willing to assist the Senator from Georgia \nin securing these resources.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I would say to my colleague, that I strongly support \nthe transfer of the funds, identified in the conference report, to \nInternational Narcotics Control for drug interdiction \n\n[[Page S 16495]]\n\nactivities and will work side-by-side with the Senator from Georgia to \nensure these resources are committed to our war on drugs.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. I thank the chairman for his efforts to stop the flow \nof illegal narcotics into the United States.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays on the motion \nto concur in the House amendment with the Leahy-Kassebaum amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the motion.\n  The yeas and nays have been ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. LOTT.

A bill to amend the Food Security Act of 1985 to minimize \nthe regulatory burden on agricultural producers in the conservation of \nhighly erodible land, wetland, and retired cropland, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry.\n\n\n           the agricultural resources enhancement act of 1995\n\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I am very pleased to join Senators Dole, \nGrassley, and Craig today in introducing the Agricultural Resources \nEnhancement Act of 1995, which is our blueprint for the conservation \ntitle of the new farm bill. This legislation builds on agriculture's \nenvironmental successes over the past decade while also adding new \nflexibility for our farmers and ranchers as they enter the 21st \ncentury.\n  In May I advanced several concepts to improve the Conservation \nReserve Program, our conservation land retirement initiative. I also \nintroduced the new Environmental Quality Incentives Program, which I am \nproud to note was included in the budget reconciliation bill approved \nby the Senate last week. Meanwhile, Senators Dole, Grassley, and Craig \ndeveloped several concepts for the CRP and for the conservation \ncompliance and swampbuster programs. The bill we are introducing today \ncombines the best of our recommendations into a single strategy that \nwill protect both the environment and the property rights of our \nNation's agricultural producers.\n  Our proposal improves the CRP by adding a new water quality emphasis \nand by targeting the program to the highly erodible land most in need \nof protection. There is land now in the CRP that can be brought back \ninto production without harming the environment. At the same time, \nthere is also valuable acreage not now in the reserve that deserves \nlong-term protection. This legislation accomplishes both goals.\n  This bill also makes much needed changes to the swampbuster \ncompliance program, including an exemption for frequently cropped \nfarmland. In the conservation compliance program, farmers would gain \nsignificant new flexibility to adopt soil-saving techniques. Our goal \nis to make both programs effective in preserving valuable resources and \nworkable in the field.\n  Finally, our legislation includes unprecedented provisions to improve \nwildlife habitat on agricultural lands. Frequently cropped wetlands \nwould be eligible for the CRP. Habitat potential will be considered in \nevaluating offers to enroll land in the CRP and the Wetlands Reserve \nProgram. Expiring water bank acres would be eligible for the WRP. And \nthe Secretary is encouraged to maximize wildlife habitat benefits from \nall our conservation programs.\n  My cosponsors and I represent a broad range of agricultural interests \nand have diverse regional backgrounds. As such, I am optimistic the \nprovisions we have included in our bill will be embraced by a majority \nin the the Agriculture Committee and in the Senate as a whole. I look \nforward to working with all my colleagues in developing a new farm bill \nwith provisions as meaningful for the environment as those in the \nlandmark farm bill we passed a decade ago.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1373\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

PURPOSES.\n\n       The purposes of this Act are to--\n       (1) restore respect for private property rights and the \n     productive capacity of the agricultural sector;\n       (2) reduce unnecessary regulatory burdens on farmers while \n     maintaining basic environmental objectives; and\n       (3) recognize that conservation and environmental \n     objectives are best met with voluntary efforts.\n\n     SEC. 3.

Mr. President, when Republicans took control of Congress in \nJanuary, we promised the American people that we would rein in the \nFederal Government, and shift power back where it belongs--to the \nStates and to the people. The Senate has worked hard to fulfill that \npromise. We are tackling regulatory reform, tax reform, and private \nproperty rights--and we are just getting started.\n  Today, I am joined by Senator Lugar, Senator Craig, and Senator \nGrassley, to introduce the Resource Enhancement Act of 1995. This bill \noutlines practical and necessary reforms to the environmental \nprovisions of the 1995 farm bill.\n  Mr. President, the 1985 farm bill included three environmental \nprovisions which revolutionized farm policy. Swampbuster, sodbuster, \nand the Conservation Reserve Program provided the first link between \nthe preservation of soil and wetlands, and farm program participation.\n  No doubt about it, these programs have been successful. But over the \npast decade, we have learned many valuable lessons. Now it is clear \nthat substantive reform is needed. These provisions were not intended \nto put high-quality land in the CRP. They were not intended to allow \nthe U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service or the Army Corps of Engineers to \nusurp the authority of the USDA.\n  In 1985, no one anticipated that a blanket ``highly erodible land'' \ndesignation--based on 1930's wind data--would reduce property values in \n13 western Kansas counties. In 1985, no one expected that existing \ndrainage ditches or tiles in farmed fields would be labeled \n``abandoned'' and thus be prevented from repair.\n\n  In my view, this legislation achieves balanced reform by building on \nthe intent of the original legislation. The primary focus of the 1985 \nfarm bill was preventing soil erosion. We have made good progress \ntoward that goal, but much remains to be done. Now we must expand our \nfocus to include water quality and wildlife habitat improvements. Soil \nconservation and the Conservation Reserve Program are crucial to \nachieving those goals.\n  In the past, farm program participation was tied to conservation \ncompliance. However, the trend in farm spending is clear. Since 1985, \nCommodity Credit Corporation spending on wheat has declined over 40 \npercent. Spending on milo has declined a staggering 69 percent. At this \npace, any linkage will soon vanish. If we aim to fulfill the intent of \nconservation and wetlands laws--and we should--we must adjust to \ntoday's conditions.\n  Earlier this year, I spoke to the American Farm Bureau Federation's \nannual meeting. Farmers there told me that they are willing to accept \nless Government support--if the Government will stop interfering in \ntheir businesses.\n  Our bill is a prescription for judicious reform. In my view, it is a \nremedy desperately needed to save farmers from a terminal case of \noverregulation.\n  This legislation will accomplish three basic goals:\n  First, reduce unnecessary regulatory burdens, while maintaining basic \nenvironmental objectives;\n  Second, restore respect for basic private property rights;\n  Third, promote voluntary compliance of conservation and environmental \nobjectives.\n\n  Further, this bill adds flexibility and uniformity to conservation \nand wetlands compliance.\n  Flexibility will be the guiding principle of conservation compliance. \nThe current system of measuring erosion and regulating compliance will \nbe clarified and codified.\n  The Conservation Reserve Program will be reauthorized and modified. \nIn addition to protecting highly erodible land, the program will \nincorporate water quality goals, wetlands protection, and wildlife \npreservation.\n  Many farmers tell me that the current swampbuster regulations allow \nthe Government to infringe on their property rights. However, the \nconservation community tells me that swampbuster is one of the most \nimportant wetlands protection laws ever enacted. In our bill, we \naddress the need for deregulation by exempting frequently cropped and \nnuisance wetlands. At the same time, we aim to further wetlands \nprotection by directing USDA to enroll wetlands in the CRP.\n  Mr. President, this bill is the result of months of hard work and \ncooperation among conservation, wildlife, and farm groups. I believe \nits impact will be good for the environment, good for wildlife \npreservation, and good for farmers. It is my hope that this legislation \nrepresents a new covenant between the environmental and farm \ncommunities. I urge my colleagues to join me in this effort to give the \nAmerican people better, not bigger government.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I am very proud to introduce a bill today \nthat I hope will serve as the framework for crafting the conservation \ntitle of the 1995 farm bill. The Resources Enhancement Act is a \nbalanced approach to blending the successes of past policy with the \nchanging scope of future needs.\n  The role of conservation programs in American agriculture are \nsometimes overlooked and underestimated. Farmers and ranchers are the \noriginal environmentalists and because of their dependence on the land \nthey continue to implement voluntary practices that are in the best \ninterests of those resources.\n  The Resources Enhancement Act will maximize the voluntary efforts of \nfarmers and ranchers by extending the role of State and Federal \nagencies, as well as some private entities, as partners in that effort. \nThis includes an extension of the immensely popular resource \nconservation and development districts through 2002.\n  However, it is of the utmost importance that Government agencies are \nnot placed in the role of policing the actions of these farmers. This \nbill emphasizes technical advice and cost share of projects for our \nNation's farmers, rather than enforcement and penalties.\n  The Conservation Reserve Program as currently implemented enjoys \nwidespread support among Idaho farmers. CRP will be extended for at \nleast another 10 years under the Resources Enhancement Act. The \npositive gains in soil conservation will be continued along with an \nincreased focus on water quality and wildlife habitat.\n  Idaho farmers will now be able to enroll hill tops and filter strips, \nrather than entire fields of productive land. A premium of up to 125 \npercent of productivity adjusted rental rates will be paid for those \npartial field enrollments.\n  For those still submitting entire field bids, the enrollment criteria \nof an erodibility index of 8 is similar to the current program. To \nprovide some stability to farmers and local economies, a floor will be \nestablished for reenrollments. That floor will be 80 percent of the \naverage rental rate for other contracts in the same county.\n  Common sense must also prevail in other farm programs, especially \nthose relating to compliance with conservation requirements on highly \nerodible lands. This bill will increase the flexibility of producers in \nmeeting the requirements of their approved conservation plans.\n  For the first time, alternate conservation systems will be written \ninto law and the use of on-farm research will be encouraged. Farmers \nfrom across the Nation will also benefit from expedited USDA decisions \non requests for variances to their conservation compliance plans.\n  The issue of good faith and unintended violations is also addressed. \nFrom this bill forward, good-faith infractions by the farmer will be \ntreated in good faith by the Department. Those good-faith violations \nwill not be subject to a penalty. For any other violation, the size of \nthe penalty will equate to the size of the violation. Currently, a \nsmall area of noncompliance on a farm can place an entire operation at \nrisk. The commonsense provisions of the Resources Enhancement Act will \nrectify that situation.\n  Common sense also prevails in the sections of the bill that address \nreform of the swampbuster program. Improvements similar to the highly \nerodible section are made in swampbuster with regard to good faith \nviolations and all penalties.\n  This bill will also place authority for ag wetlands in its natural \nplace--the Department of Agriculture. The restoration and enhancement \nof existing wetlands and creation of new wetlands will be enhanced with \nan increased emphasis on mitigation banking.\n\n[[Page S 16503]]\n\n  The Resource Enhancement Act also ensures that the wetlands reserve \nprogram will be continued through 2002. This program allows for 20- or \n30-year easements for wetlands or water quality to be placed on \nagricultural lands.\n  The broad scope of resource conservation needs are addressed in this \nbill while recognizing the ongoing voluntary efforts of farmers and \nranchers and maintaining a respect for private property rights. These \nresource needs are best addressed by continued voluntary efforts in \nthis time of declining Federal resources. It makes sense that the \nregulatory burdens on farmers and ranchers are decreasing, since the \nlevel of past farm program payments is also declining.\n  I commend Senators Dole, Grassley, and Lugar for their efforts in \ncrafting this bill and urge our other colleagues to join us in \nsupporting the Resources Enhancement Act of 1995.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n\n             By Mr. CRAIG (for himself and Mr. Kempthorne):\n\n  S. 1374.

Mr. President, public Law 94-199, designating the Hells \nCanyon National Recreation Area, was signed into law December 31, 1975.\n  Section 10 of the act instructs the Secretary to promulgate such \nrules and regulations as he deems necessary to accomplish the purposes \nof the act, including a ``provision for the control of the use and \nnumber of motorized and nonmotorized river craft: Provided, That the \nuse of such craft is hereby recognized as a valid use of the Snake \nRiver within the recreation area--''.\n  This language seems clear. However, the original intent of the act, \nthe compromises and promises that allowed its passage, seem to have \nbeen forgotten or clouded with time. Assurances 20 years ago that long-\nestablished and traditional uses, such as motorized boating, are a \nvalid use of the river and would be continued with the support of \npeople who would otherwise have opposed the legislation. Yet, as the \noriginal participants disappear from the scene and new players arrive, \nthese arrangements are being callously disregarded.\n  Throughout the process leading to designation and the ensuing \nmanagement planning efforts, the USDA--Forest Service has exhibited a \nbias against motorized river craft. During hearings on the act, \nAssistant Secretary of Agriculture Long testified on a proposed \namendment that would have authorized the Forest Service to prohibit jet \nboats. He noted that there were ``times when boating perhaps should be \nprohibited entirely''. Senator Church responded to that testimony \nunfavorably, explaining:\n\n       . . . jet boats have been found to be the preferred method \n     of travel by a great many people who have gone into the \n     canyon. This is a matter of such importance that Congress \n     itself should decide what the guidelines would be with \n     respect to regulation of traffic on the river and that the \n     discretion ought not to be left entirely to the \n     administrative agencies.\n\n  In a clear indication of Congress' intentions, the jet boat ban was \nnot adopted.\n  Later, in its first version of a comprehensive management plan in \n1981, the Forest Service attempted to bypass congressional intent by \neliminating power boating from the heart of Hells Canyon for the entire \nprimary recreation season, granting exclusive use of the river from \nWild Sheep Rapid to Rush Creek Rapid to those using nonmotorized river \ncraft. Responding to public outrage, the Chief reconsidered his \ndecision, and issued a new plan allowing access to the entire river for \na very limited number of powered craft. On appeal, Assistant Secretary \nCrowell overturned this decision, allowing unlimited day use by \npowerboats and citing failure on the part of the Forest Service to \ndemonstrate a need for such severe restrictions.\n\n  More recently, Wallowa-Whitman National Forest Supervisor Robert \nRichmond initiated a review and revision of the river management \nportion of the comprehensive management plan. Despite the lack of any \ndemonstrable resource problems, and in the face of overwhelming public \nsupport for motorized river craft, the agency again decided to close \npart of the river to powerboats. The new river management plan adopted \nin November 1994 would have closed the heart of the canyon to motorized \nriver craft for 3 days a week in July and August, the peak of the \nrecreation season. In response to the many appeals received, a stay was \ngranted by the regional Forester, avoiding a disastrous implementation \nof the new plan in 1995.\n  However, the regional forester's eventual decision on the substance \nof the appeals made clear that he supports the concept of a partial \nclosure of the river to motorized river craft. The agency's intent to \npursue a closure is quite evident. Even a partial closure is \nobjectionable, as it is contrary to the intent of the law and the \nhistory of the river.\n  The Snake River is different from most rivers in the Wild and Scenic \nSystem. It is a high-volume river with a long and colorful history of \nuse by motorized river craft. The first paying passengers to travel up \nthrough its rapids on a motor boat made their journey on the 110-foot \nColonel Wright in 1865, and a memorable journey that was. Later, the \n136-foot Shoshone made its plunge through the canyon from Boise to \nLewiston in 1870 and was followed by the 165-foot Norma in 1895. \nGasoline-powered craft began hauling people, produce, and supplies in \nand out of the canyon in 1910, and the first contract for regular mail \ndelivery was signed in 1919, continuing today. The Corps of Engineers \nbegan blasting rocks and improving channels in 1903. They worked \ncontinuously until 1975 to make the river safer for navigation.\n  Today the vast majority of people--over 80 percent--who recreate in \nthe Hells Canyon segment of the Snake River access it by motorized \nriver craft. Some are private boaters, and others travel with \ncommercial operators on scenic tours. This access is accomplished with \na minimum of impact to the river, the land, or their resources. Most \nriver users, motorized and nonmotorized, are willing to share the \nriver. However, a small group of nonmotorized users objects to seeing \npowered craft. Those unwilling to share have a rich choice of \nalternatives in this geographic area, such as the Selway and Middle \nFork of the Salmon rivers. Motorized users, however, don't have that \nluxury. The only other white water rivers open to them in the Wild and \nScenic System are portions of the Rogue and Salmon rivers. Without a \nsingle doubt, the Hells Canyon portion of the Snake River is our \nNation's premier white water power boating river.\n  Mr. President, as you can see, the use of motorized river craft is \ndeeply interwoven in the history, traditions, and culture of Hells \nCanyon. That is why Congress deliberately created a nonwilderness \ncorridor for the entire length of the river. That is why Congress tried \nto make it clear that use of both motorized and nonmotorized river \ncraft are valid uses of the river within the recreation area--the \nentire river for the entire year. It was not the intent of Congress to \nallow the managing agency to decide that one valid use would prevail to \nthe exclusive use over the other.\n  Quite clearly, the issue of power boating's validity will not be \nsettled unless decided by the courts or unless Public Law 94-199 is \nclarified by Congress. The courts are already burdened by too many \ncases of this type, resulting in a waste of time, energy, and financial \nresources for both the United States and its citizens. The only \npractical and permanent resolution of this issue is to clarify \ncongressional intent in a manner that will not allow any future \nmisunderstanding. This is what I propose to do with this legislation.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. BURNS (for himself, Mr. Craig, Mr. Gorton, Mr. Grassley, \n        Mr. McConnell, Mr. Daschle, Mr. Harkin, Mr. Kerrey, and Mr. \n        Kempthorne):\n  S. 1375. A bill to preserve and strengthen the Foreign Market \nDevelopment Cooperator Program of the Department of Agriculture, and \nfor other purposes; to the Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and \nForestry.\n\n\n     the foreign market development cooperator program act of 1995\n\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I rise today together with Senators Craig, \n\n[[Page S 16504]]\n\nGorton, Grassley, McConnell, Daschle, Harkin, and Kerrey of Nebraska to \nintroduce legislation that will preserve and strengthen the Foreign \nMarket Development Cooperator Program of the Department of Agriculture.\n  In an effort to balance the budget by the year 2002, Congress has had \nto make some very difficult decisions. Whatever the final outcome of \nthis process in budget reconciliation the fact remains that the \nAmerican farmer will be asked to move into a market-oriented farm \npolicy. Therefore it has become crystal clear that we must open up our \nthinking and provide our farmers access to international markets.\n  Changes that have resulted from the Uruguay round of GATT and the \ngrowing privatization of importing regimes in overseas markets demand \nthat export programs be instituted that meet current needs and futures \nchallenges. Such programs should reflect not only the successes we have \nhad in the past, but they must also be dynamic and flexible enough to \nbuild on these gains.\n  One program that has stood the test of time is the Foreign Market \nDevelopment Program, also known as the Cooperator Program. Amendments \nto the Agricultural Trade Development and Assistance Act of 1954 and \nthe Agriculture and Food Act of 1981 authorized market development \nactivities and the use of Federal funds to develop, maintain, and \nexpand foreign markets for U.S. agriculture commodities. It was \ndetermined by the USDA's Foreign Agricultural Service that this could \nbest be accomplished by private, nonprofit agricultural organizations. \nThese organizations have been required to share in the financial \nexpense of the market development activities.\n  In 1988, Congress stated,\n\n       It is the sense of Congress that the foreign market \n     development Cooperator Program of the Service, and the \n     activities of the individual foreign market development \n     cooperator organizations, have been among the most successful \n     and cost-effective means to expand United States agricultural \n     exports. Congress affirms its support for the program and the \n     activities of the cooperator organizations. The Administrator \n     and the private sector should work together to ensure that \n     the program, and the activities of cooperator organizations, \n     are expanded in the future.\n\n  While Congress has provided full funding through the regular \nappropriations process every year since the Cooperator Program's \ndevelopment in 1954, we have provided little statutory direction to the \nUSDA and the Foreign Agricultural Service. Congress has simply \nestablished broad goals for market development programs. As a result, \nthe Foreign Agricultural Service has been given wide discretion in \nestablishing programs and funding.\n  Mr. President, this arrangement has been highly successful for a \nnumber of years. Unfortunately, in recent years the Cooperator Program \nhas fallen victim to the intense competition within FAS for fewer \ndiscretionary funds. This has led to FAS requesting cuts in the program \nas a means of funding other FAS activities. Due to the success of this \nprogram, Congress has decided that these funds should continue and has \nstated such to the Foreign Agricultural Service. This year that \nadministration proposed a budget that would have reduced the funding \nfor the Cooperator Program by 20 percent.\n  A reduction of this magnitude would have meant a U.S. retreat from \ninternational markets at a time when the Foreign Agricultural Service \nhas testified that the resources and staff of nonprofit commodity were \nless than adequate. This is to say that our nonprofit agricultural \norganizations were not able to meet the challenges and changes in the \ninternational market place. On the more meaningful level, this would \nhave meant fewer opportunities for the producers in the world market.\n  As a member of the Agricultural Appropriations Subcommittee I can \ntell you what we took this seriously and restored full finding for the \nprogram this year. But we grow weary of the continued assault on such a \nsuccessful program. It is a practice that must stop. This bill will \nstop this, by establishing a separate identity for the Foreign \nMarket Development Cooperator Program from that of FAS.\n\n  The Foreign Market Development Cooperator Program is not only one of \nthe oldest export programs, but it is also one of the most essential \nand effective. In fiscal year 1994, cooperators expended $29.8 million \nof FAS funds on the market development program. Cooperators reported \nadditional contributions of $30 million. These cooperators conducted \nmore than 1,000 individual market development activities in over 100 \ncountries. The private sector funding assists in reducing the deficit \nwhile maintaining our presence in overseas markets. The involvement of \nthe private sector also creates incentives for effective programs as it \nis their own producer dollars at stake. This has created an incentive-\nbased program that FAS has stated that the combined cooperator and \nforeign third party contributions have exceeded the FAS contribution \nevery year.\n  The cooperator program has been long regarded as a model of public-\nprivate sector cooperation. FAS has recently stated that the market \ndevelopment cooperator program has played an important role in \nincreasing U.S. agricultural exports to the approximately $43.5 billion \nin fiscal year 1994.\n  According to a senior FAS official, the cooperator program is the \nmainstay of market development activities. Cooperators are by \ndefinition nonprofit, agricultural trade associations which represent \nfarmers and farm-related interests. Cooperators participating include \nrepresentatives from the feed grains, wheat, soybean, rice, cotton, \npoultry, meat, and forest products as well as many others.\n  High-volume commodities, like grains, rarely lend themselves to \ntraditional consumer promotion programs, but rely instead on working \ndirectly with end-users and processors on a regular basis. Cooperator \nprojects are suited to trade servicing activities such as the \ncollection and dissemination of market facts; training programs; and \ndemonstrations or technical seminars on product uses to producers, \nprocessors, manufacturers, and consumers. This focus requires a \ncontinual presence in the overseas market which is essential for the \nUnited States to remain competitive. Regular contact with the customer \nis necessary to follow shifts in the rapidly changing world market.\n  In my State of Montana, where we export up to 70 percent of the grain \nthat we grow, programs of this nature are extremely important. In \nrecent times when we have signed agreements with the world to place our \nfamily farmers in the world market it has become increasingly important \nthat we provide them with tools to compete in these markets. I have \nstated many times that the American farmer is more than willing to \ncompete with any and all farmers around the world. But we have placed \nthem at a disadvantage by making them compete with the governments of \nother countries. This is a program that will provide them with a tool \nto use in the world market.\n  Throughout my time here in Washington I have fought for programs that \nwill add dollars to the pockets of the small family farmers in Montana \nand the United States. This program in its design does this, whether it \nbe a corn or soybean farmer in Iowa or a wheat and barley farmer in my \nstate of Montana. Development of this type would also benefit the \nlivestock producer in any area of our Nation. It might be a cotton \nproducer in Mississippi or Texas, or maybe a rice farmer in Arkansas, \nor maybe even a small timber operator in Washington and Idaho. Whatever \nor wherever it is that they come from, by using their matching funds \nthese cooperators have an investment and will see that they get a \nreturn on their funds. They will in turn see additional dollars for \ntheir products and will compete fully in the world market.\n  The future of this program is bright, and this legislation will make \nit only more of a reality. The unique resources that the nonprofit \nagriculture organizations bring to this cooperative program enhance the \nfuture of the exports we now have in agriculture. Recent developments \nin communications technologies hold promise for greatly enhancing the \nability of cooperator organizations to communicate with their \ncounterparts around the country and, for that matter, the rest of the \nworld.\n  Mr. President, in light of the current trend of placing our family \nfarmers on \n\n[[Page S 16505]]\n\nthe world market, and with the pressure to open the safety net which \nprotects our food supply, I find it imperative that Congress act to \ngive our rural families this tool to work within the world market. This \none tool will send a message to the country and the world that we are \nworking to keep our family farms strong and vital operations within our \neconomic structure. This message will allow the Department of \nAgriculture to focus on the opportunities that these cooperative \nefforts between the public and private sector can and will produce.\n  Mr. President, I would like to take this opportunity to invite my \ncolleagues to join me in this effort to provide an opportunity to the \nrural families in this country to meet the rest of the world on the \nfield of grain and agriculture with the tools that will help them be \nsuccessful.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, the Cooperator Program Act exemplifies the \nexport-based marketing that must occur if American agriculture is to \nlead the world into the 21st century. I am very proud to cosponsor this \nbill that will extend an extremely successful program. It is also my \ndesire to lead the efforts on the Senate Agriculture Committee to \ninclude this bill as an important provision of the trade title of the \n1995 farm bill.\n  The Cooperator Program is part of the Foreign Market Development \nProgram as currently administered by the Foreign Agriculture Service of \nUSDA. The cooperators in Foreign Market Development Program are \nregarded by many as a cost-effective and successful partnership that \nhas expanded agriculture exports.\n  Idaho wheat producers especially rely on foreign market developments \nand the exports for their economic well-being. In fact, Idaho's wheat \nproducers collectively export between 75 and 80 percent of their \nproduction every year. In 1994, the production, marketing and \nexportation of Idaho's wheat provided over 30,000 jobs and $1.09 \nbillion in economic revenue in Idaho and the rest of the Pacific \nNorthwest.\n  The Cooperator Program Act of 1995 will strengthen the foreign market \ndevelopment efforts of the past by creating a separate line-item \nauthorization for future annual appropriations process.\n  I commend Senator Burns for his efforts to introduce this legislation \nand urge my colleagues to support the bill.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, today I am pleased to join my colleagues \nSenators Burns, Craig, Grassley, McConnell, Daschle, Harkin, and \nKerrey, as an original cosponsor of the Cooperator Program Act of 1995.\n  The Foreign Market Development [FMD] Cooperator Program has been \nadministered by USDA's Foreign Agriculture Service since 1954 without \nspecific legislative authorization. Today we are introducing \nlegislation that will provide the necessary authorization to maintain, \npreserve, and strengthen the FMD Cooperator Program. The FMD Cooperator \nProgram has proven to be an effective, efficient, cost-shared program, \nproviding trade service and technical assistance for U.S. agriculture \ncommodities in overseas markets. This legislation will ensure that the \nFMD Cooperator Program is better able to compete for a limited number \nof discretionary dollars during the annual appropriations process.\n  Many important developments have taken place since the completion of \nthe Uruguay Round of the General Agreement of Tariffs and Trade [GATT]. \nI believe that GATT will continue to open new world markets for the \nUnited States so programs like FMD are even more important to give U.S. \nagriculture the tools necessary to develop, maintain, and expand \ncommercial export markets for U.S. agriculture commodities in this new \npost-GATT environment.\n  As a member of the Agriculture Appropriations Subcommittee, I have \nmade funding for export programs my top priority. I am convinced that \nthe Foreign Market Development Program, Market Promotion Program and \nthe like are absolutely necessary if U.S. Agriculture is to remain \ncompetitive in the international marketplace. It is also in the best \ninterest of the agriculture community specifically to authorize the FMD \nCooperator Program. This kind of oversight will ensure that the \nagriculture community will continue to receive the full benefits of \nthis program.\n  Since 1955, U.S. agriculture exports have increased from $3 billion \nto $43.5 billion in fiscal year 1994, and are projected to reach a \nrecord high of $51.1 billion during fiscal year 1995. USDA has stated \nthat for each dollar of taxpayer money spent on the FMD, 7 dollars' \nworth of exports are generated, and this figure continues to grow. It \nis now every day that we appropriate Federal dollars and get a return \non our investment as large and as significant as we do with the FMD.\n  In lieu of the reduction or phaseout of USDA's commodity price \nsupport programs, it seems only right to provide the agriculture \ncommunity with the tools necessary to compete in the international \nmarketplace. As I travel around my State of Washington I listen closely \nto the comments, suggestions, and concerns from my State's agriculture \ncommunity.\n  The message has been clear: Strengthen, maintain, and preserve the \ntools necessary for us to export our products. In response to these \ncomments, I believe that this legislation is the key to maintaining \nexport programs important to so many in Washington State and across the \nNation.\n  I would also like to acknowledge the overwhelming support we have \nreceived from the following State's wheat commissions. Washington, \nIdaho, Oregon, Nebraska, Kentucky, New Mexico, North Carolina, North \nDakota, South Dakota, Ohio, Arizona, Arkansas, California, Colorado, \nKansas, Maryland, Minnesota, Nebraska, Oklahoma, Texas, Virginia, and \nWyoming. Among other associations we have received support from \ninclude: Washington Education Trade Economic Committee, National \nAssociation of Wheat Growers, U.S. Wheat Associates, USA Dry Pea and \nLentil Council, National Barley Growers Association, National Council \nof Farmer Cooperatives, Western U.S. Agriculture Trade Association, \nNational Corn Growers Association, National Dry Bean Council, American \nSeed Trade Association, USA Poultry and Egg Export Council, American \nSoybean Association, National Cotton Council, National Peanut Council \nof America, and National Sunflower Association. Clearly, Mr. President, \nthis legislation has a tremendous amount of support from U.S. \nagriculture nationwide.\n  Mr. President, in closing I invite my colleagues to join me as \ncosponsors of this legislation and ask unanimous consent that a letter \nof support from the Washington State Wheat Commission be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                  Washington Wheat Commission,\n\n                                    Spokane, WA, October 12, 1995.\n     Hon. Slade Gorton,\n     U.S. Senate, Hart Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Gorton: Exports are the life blood of the \n     Washington wheat industry. Approximately 85 percent of all \n     Washington's wheat production finds it way into the export \n     market. Wheat is the number one agricultural export commodity \n     from our state, which results in a major contribution to our \n     state's economy and a major supplier of employment. Due to \n     the importance of wheat exports, I would like to ask your \n     support for a continuation and strengthening of the Foreign \n     Market Development Program (FMD) of the USDA.\n       Currently the FMD program is administered by the Foreign \n     Agricultural Service (FAS), USDA, and as Congress has already \n     stated, ``the FMD program, and the activities of individual \n     foreign market development Cooperator organizations, have \n     been among the most successful and cost-effective means to \n     expand United States' agricultural exports.''\n       Unfortunately, in recent years the cooperator program has \n     fallen victim to the intense competition within FAS for fewer \n     and fewer discretionary dollars. The FAS, with direct \n     responsibility over the operation and funding of the program, \n     has requested cuts in the program arguing that the \n     ``savings'' be used to fund certain FAS activities. For this \n     reason, we are asking that you support a separate line item \n     in the budget for the FMD program.\n       There is no question that the FMD program is one of the \n     most successful joint government-private funded activities in \n     existence. It is time to give FMD some sunlight and expose it \n     to the annual budgetary process. We welcome the opportunity \n     to tell its success stories during the budgetary debates, \n     and, at the same time, protect it from the predatory measures \n     FAS has employed. FAS is currently arguing against a special \n     line item for FMD stating that it will inhibit flexibility in \n     the program. The only flexibility that will be hurt by this \n     measure is that FAS will no longer have access to the funds.\n\n[[Page S 16506]]\n\n       For the first few years on the new program, we ask that you \n     support a minimum allocation of $40 million to the FMD \n     program.\n       Thank you, in advance, for taking this issue under \n     consideration. If you have any questions or need \n     clarification on any issue concerning the request, please do \n     not hesitate to contact me.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 James R. Walesby,\n                                                         Chairman.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. McCAIN (for himself, Mr. Thompson, Mr. Kerry, Mr. \n        Feingold, Mr. Kennedy, and Mr. Coats):\n  S. 1376. A bill to terminate unnecessary and inequitable Federal \ncorporate subsidies; to the Committee on Governmental Affairs.\n\n\n the corporate subsidy review reform and termination commission act of \n                                  1995\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, the Federal Government operates numerous \nprograms which provide direct payments, services and other benefits to \nvarious sectors of private industry. Some of these may serve a valuable \npurpose. Others, however, have long outlived their usefulness and have \nno place in a budget wherein we are asking Americans across the board \nto sacrifice on behalf of deficit reduction. Congress can no longer \ndelay taking action to correct this inequity.\n\n  Recently, the CATO Institute and the Progressive Policy Institute \nreported that the Federal Government spends as much as $85 billion per \nyear on programs like these. The Progressive Policy Institute has \nidentified an additional $30 billion per year in inequitable tax \nloopholes. Many here in Congress have identified still other sources of \nwaste. Together, these programs and policies have rightfully earned the \nmoniker ``corporate pork.''\n  Yet even when these programs have been consistently determined to \nprovide little or no benefit to the taxpayer, Congress has found it \nexceedingly difficult to reduce or eliminate them.\n  Pressure to maintain the status quo can come in many forms: \ninstitutional pressure to maintain that which is considered consistent \nwith the interests of one party or another; political pressure to \nmaintain programs or policies that are favorable to particular \nconstituencies; and special interest pressure that may come to bear in \na variety of shapes and forms when a member or small group of members \nseeks to modify these programs.\n  In order to override these elusive yet firmly entrenched political \nobstacles, this amendment establishes a one-time, nonpartisan \ncommission--styled along the lines of the successful Base Realignment \nand Closure Commission [BRAC]--charged with reforming corporate \nsubsidies.\n  When all is said and done, the BRAC's work will yield billions of \ndollars in savings by identifying the waste in just one department. The \nAmerican public will get to enjoy the fruit of BRAC's labors largely \ndue to the fact that the Commission was able to operate in an \nenvironment completely devoid of the pressures I have just described.\n  By applying similar methods to examine the programs and policies of \nthe entire Federal Government, Congress may be able to build on this \nrecord of success, saving even more for the taxpayers of this nation.\n  The structure and operations of this commission may seem quite \nfamiliar to those who followed the BRAC proceedings. Commissioners will \nbe nominated, appointed, and confirmed in the same manner. They will \nbegin their work in January 1997 and report to the President by July. \nThe Commission will work closely with each Federal agency to identify \nprograms and tax provisions which are no longer necessary to serve the \npurpose for which they were intended. They will also identify programs \nwhich unduly benefit a narrow corporate interest rather than providing \nclear and convincing public benefits. And, most importantly, they will \noperate as a nonpartisan, a-political body--using only the guidelines \nwe will establish with this amendment--to guide their actions.\n  By the summer of 1997, the Commission will provide the President and \nCongress recommendations for termination or specific modification of \nprograms that satisfy these conditions.\n  I would like to emphasize that this bill's goals do not include \nincreasing revenues or creating new taxes; the Commission will simply \nformulate recommendations to reform those programs or policies that \nresult in inequitable financial advantages for special interest groups. \nEvery dollar spent on an unnecessary program or lost through in \ninequitable tax loophole is one more that is not available for much \nneeded broad-based tax relief.\n  Congress' role in this process will, however, differ somewhat from \nthat which it plays under BRAC. In this case, enacting the Commission's \nrecommendations may result in changes to Federal statute. Therefore, \nthe Congress will be required to take positive action; a vote to accept \nor reject proposed changes in law--unlike BRAC which was accepted as \nlaw by default through Congress' inaction. Finally, in order to ensure \nthat this stage of the process does not present opportunities for \nparochial interests to influence the process, disciplined and expedited \nprocedures, similar to those used for congressional consideration of \nthe budget, will be utilized.\n  It is evident that Congress has as much difficulty closing loopholes \nas it does closing unnecessary military bases. I, like many of my \ncolleagues, have come to this floor on numerous occasions to offer \narguments against the type of waste generated by the programs this \namendment seeks to eliminate or reform. Like many of my colleagues, I \nhave also been unsuccessful in the vast majority of these efforts. \nRegrettably, time, experience, and the lessons of history leave me \nhighly skeptical that a spontaneous awakening is likely to occur here \nin Congress.\n  Therefore, despite my own reservations about passing along \ncongressional responsibilities to outside commissions, I feel it is \nclearly time to institute alternative solutions. The taxpayers of this \nNation do not deserve to wait any longer for us to get this right. For \nthis reason, I think the most--or perhaps the least--we can expect from \nthis body is that we collectively recognize this problem, and employ a \nlogical and fair technique to help us solve it. The Commission proposed \nby this legislation provides an expedient opportunity to institute \npositive, meaningful change.\n  I am pleased and encouraged by the bipartisan cosponsorship of this \nbill, and am hopeful that the divergence of philosophies represented by \nthis group is an indication of wide support within Congress for this \nmeasure.\n  I urge all of my colleagues to examine this legislation, consider the \ncircumstances that have caused it to come about, and join myself and \nthe cosponsors of this bill in giving life to a solution. I can see no \nrational reason to oppose this bill, and more reasons than we have time \nto present to support it.\n  Stand up for the American taxpayer, stand up for change, and stand in \ndefiance of business as usual.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. Mr. President, the Corporate Subsidy Termination \nCommission Act which my colleagues and I are introducing today will \ntake us one step further on the road to fairness in Government.\n  This Congress has done a thorough and, I believe, admirable job of \nexamining thousands of items of Government spending. We have identified \nareas of spending which should be reformed because they don't work as \nthey should. And we have identified those which should be terminated \nbecause their existence cannot be justified. Some areas, such as the \nFederal welfare program, have been completely transformed. In each case \nwe have asked several questions: Does this spending promote a useful \npublic purpose? if so, can Government afford it? Should the effort and \nthe money for it be transferred to the State or local level, where it \nis closer to those it is supposed to benefit?\n  As part of this process we have examined some programs whose primary \nbeneficiaries are profitmaking enterprises--businesses of all sizes. In \nseveral such cases we have made progress on incremental reforms. For \ninstance, the Senate passed an amendment to restrict the Marketing \nPromotion Program through which $110 million is spent annually to \nunderwrite advertising by some of our largest corporations in foreign \ncountries. In addition, the program under which the Government leases \nmineral rights on public lands to private companies is being reformed \nto \n\n[[Page S 16507]]\n\nallow the Government to charge fees more in line with real values.\n  But these efforts and others that are ongoing are necessarily \npiecemeal. We can cut or restrict a corporate subsidy here, and leave \nanother one untouched.\n  Last week, as part of an effort to highlight the issue of Federal \nsubsidies to profitmaking enterprises, a bipartisan group of colleagues \nand I proposed ending 12 specific items of corporate pork. These items \nwere chosen from Federal spending programs which are characterized by \nsome element of corporate subsidization. They affected areas including \npublic resource management, energy development, export promotion, local \nconstruction, utility loans, sale of public airwaves, tourism \npromotion, defense construction, and aircraft design. They were only a \nsampling of all such programs--the Cato Institute recently identified \n129 items characterized as corporate pork. Senator McCain offered this \npackage as an amendment to the reconciliation bill, where it received \nthe support of only a fourth of this Body.\n  Clearly this problem needs to be attacked in a different way.\n  The bill we are introducing today also has bipartisan support. It \nestablishes a Corporate Subsidy Termination Commission which is charged \nwith identifying programs or tax policies which provide unnecessary \nbenefits or inequitable tax advantages to profitmaking enterprises. The \nCommission is fashioned after the BRAC Commission, with expedited \nlegislation procedures similar to those provided for the Congressional \nBudget Resolution. I ask unanimous consent that an overview of this \nCorporate Subsidy Termination Commission be printed in the Record.\n\n  Why establish a Commission and a new process to do what we could \nconceivably do directly?\n  First, and most important, this Commission will do what we cannot do \nwell: make an overall assessment of all programs, on both the spending \nand revenue sides, at one time. Over the years we have created an \nintricate, interwoven system of subsidies, taxes and exemptions. As a \nrural Tennessee utility which would be affected by the spending cuts we \nproposed last week pointed out to me, they are competing against other \nenergy providers who receive subsidies in the form of tax breaks.\n  Second, our experience last week demonstrated that voting hit or miss \non individual items is not going to be successful. One person's pork is \nanother's prize. And no one wants to give up their prize program if \nthere isn't shared sacrifice. With the commission approach, we will \nknow that all programs have been examined and those which provide \nunjustified subsidies have been exposed.\n  Third, the members of the Commission will be appointed specifically \nfor this purpose by the President and the Congress. They will possess \nthe expertise, authority and stature necessary to do the job.\n  Fourth, the commission's recommendations will not be buried in the \ncorner of a Federal agency or a congressional committee. While the \nPresident and Congress will be able to amend or reject the Commission's \nrecommendations, they must address them.\n   Mr. President, we should require no less of profitmaking enterprises \nthan we ask of all Americans. It is a matter of fairness and shared \nsacrifice. At a time when the national debate is focused on getting \ncontrol of the budget, now and in the future, we cannot afford to \nprovide corporate subsidies which undermine our efforts and which send \nthe wrong message to American taxpayers.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n      Corporate Subsidy Review, Reform and Termination Commission\n\n       ``The Termination Commission will do for Corporate Pork \n     what BRAC did for military infrastructure; identify and \n     terminate excess and waste!''\n       The eight-members of the Commission would: be nominated by \n     the President by January 31; have six members nominated by \n     Congress; require Senate Confirmation for their appointments; \n     and identify programs or tax policies that provide \n     unnecessary benefits to for-profit enterprise, or serve the \n     pecuniary interests of an enterprise but do not provide a \n     public benefit, or; provide inequitable tax advantages to \n     for-profit enterprise.\n       Federal Agencies would: Submit a list of programs which \n     meet ``corporate pork'' definitional criteria no later than \n     their budget request in January 1997; and submit \n     recommendations to the commission for termination or reform \n     of such programs.\n       Commission would: Review the agencies' recommendations, \n     perform their own analysis; receive Comptroller General's \n     analysis April 15, 1997; and submit a comprehensive reform \n     proposal to the President by July 1, 1997.\n       President would: Have 15 days to review the Commission's \n     recommendations; have the ability to suggest changes to the \n     Commission's package; and forward the package directly if \n     there are no changes.\n       Commission would: Have until August 15 to act upon the \n     President's proposed changes; and have until August 15 to \n     reject the President's changes.\n       President: Must forward Commission's revised proposal to \n     Congress by September 1. Failure to do so terminates the \n     entire process.\n       Congress will: Have 20 days for Committee review in both \n     Houses; follow Budget Act expedited procedures; and have \n     limited debate and amendments.\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I am pleased to join with my friend, the \nsenior Senator from Arizona [Mr. McCain] in introducing this \nlegislation. This is the most recent of several bipartisan reform \nefforts in which I have joined with Senator McCain.\n  In many ways, this measure focuses on the downstream results of the \nother problems on which we have worked. Unjustified corporate \nsubsidies, through direct appropriation or through the Tax Code, \ncontinue to prosper in part because of the influence of the special \nconstituencies that benefit from those subsidies.\n  But, Mr. President, these subsidies also continue to exist through \nsimple inattention, and the Corporate Subsidy Commission created by \nthis legislation will bring some needed scrutiny to subsidies that, \nthough they may have had some merit once, are no longer justified.\n  Targeting unjustified corporate subsidies would be appropriate at any \ntime, but they are especially needed as we try to balance the Federal \nbooks. We absolutely must subject these kinds of corporate subsidies to \ntougher scrutiny than we have before.\n  As with the spending we provide to individuals, nonprofits, and State \nand local governments, if we are to eliminate the Federal budget \ndeficit, we need to demand a higher level of justification for \ncorporate programs.\n  There is no doubt that those of us who have cosponsored this \nlegislation differ greatly on the total package of spending cuts we \nwould propose to balance the Federal budget, as the reconciliation \nlegislation this body passed dramatically demonstrates.\n  But we are all united in suggesting that much more needs to be done \nin the area of corporate subsidies.\n  This legislation continues the broader effort to reduce the deficit \nthat I have made, and which began with an 82+ point plan to reduce the \ndeficit I offered during my campaign for the U.S. Senate in 1992.\n  Many of the provisions of that plan eliminated or reduced corporate \nsubsidies that are no longer justified, including both direct \nappropriations and tax expenditures.\n  Mr. President, I am particularly pleased that the Commission's \nmission will include the review of tax expenditures. They are a \nsignificant and growing portion of the Federal budget. In a June, 1994 \nreport, the General Accounting Office, using data from the Joint \nCommittee on Taxation, stated that spending for tax expenditures \ntotaled about $400 billion in 1993.\n  As that report notes, spending done through tax expenditures moves \nimmediately to the front of the budget line. Tax expenditures are, in \neffect, funded before the Federal Government pays for a single school \nlunch or an aircraft carrier because, under our budget process, tax \nexpenditures must be funded as they are created, and with the exception \nof a few that must be reauthorized, they can grow in the absence of \nCongressional oversight.\n  Mr. President, some current tax expenditures are certainly justified. \nHowever, the system of tax expenditures itself lacks appropriate review \nand control mechanisms, and many individual expenditures are \nunjustified.\n  The result is a loss of overall economic efficiency for the Nation's \neconomy, and scarce budget resources at a time when we are trying to \nbalance the Federal books.\n\n[[Page S 16508]]\n\n  This Commission can provide needed review of inefficient and \nexpensive corporate subsidies, requiring Congress to examine this \nspending in a timely manner.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. LUGAR:\n  S. 1377. A bill to provide authority for the assessment of cane sugar \nproduced in the Everglades agricultural area of Florida, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry.\n\n\n                         cane sugar legislation\n\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I am introducing legislation today to \nestablish an Everglades restoration fund. The Everglades restoration \nfund would be financed by a 2-cent-per-pound assessment on all cane \nsugar produced in the Everglades agricultural area, Florida. It is \nestimated that a 2-cents-per-pound assessment would produce revenues of \n$70 million per year or approximately $350 million over a 5-year \nperiod. These funds will be used for land acquisition in the Everglades \nagricultural area.\n  An Everglades restoration plan has been devised in cooperation with \nthe Corps of Engineers and the South Florida Water Management District. \nThis plan calls for 131,000 acres of land within the southern \nEverglades agricultural area to be acquired at an estimated cost of \n$355 million, assuming an acre cost of $2,700 per acre.\n  I believe this plan is fair to Florida sugar producers. Because of \nthe Federal sugar program, sugar prices in Florida are higher than they \notherwise would be.\n  The sugar growers in the Everglades agricultural area are also \nbeneficiaries of federally subsidized water projects which created \nagricultural lands in the Everglades agricultural area and which pump \nwaters in and out of these lands as needed for sugar production. It is \nreasonable for these beneficiaries to help restore the unique ecosystem \nthat these projects have degraded.\n  I am aware of the fact that the State of Florida has enacted the \nEverglades Forever Act, which imposes a tax of $25 to $35 per acre over \n20 years to raise a total of $322 million to improve water quality.\n  Sugar producers have also agreed to take other steps designed to \nimprove water quality. These steps include compliance with phosphorous \ndischarge standards and the creation of stormwater treatment areas to \nhelp filter phosphorous discharges and for other purposes. However, \nthese measures are primarily related to improving water quality in the \nEverglades. My proposal is designed to restore the ecosystem to a \nnatural condition with regard to water flows.\n  No more important or complex ecosystem in need of restoration exists \nin our Nation than the Everglades in south Florida. It is a troubled \nsystem, on the brink of collapse, largely caused by federally supported \ndrainage construction designed to promote and protect agriculture. This \nproblem is exacerbated by the Federal sugar program. Failure to act \nwill doom the Everglades to accelerated deterioration, a tragic and \ntotally unacceptable fate.\n  Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to support this bill to restore \nthe Everglades and to bring assurances to homeowners in Florida, to \nbring assurances to those who fear the end of the coral in the Keys, \nwho are disturbed by the algae in the Florida Bay, and who, in fact, \nappreciate that a fine balance is created here between benefits given \nto the sugar producers and an assessment that will make all the \ndifference in the restoration of the Everglades.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1377\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SEC. 1 EVERGLADES AGRICULTURAL

 (D) by inserting a new subparagraph (C) that reads as \n     follows:\n       ``(C) in the case of marketings from production from the \n     Everglades Agricultural Area of Florida as determined by the \n     Secretary, in addition to assessments under subparagraph B, \n     the sum of 2 cents per pound of raw cane sugar for each of \n     the 1996 through 2000 fiscal years;''\n       (b) redesignating subsection (j) as subsection (k); and\n       (c) by inserting a new subsection (j) that reads as \n     follows:\n       ``(j) Everglades Agricultural Area Account--\n       (1) In general.--\n       ``(A) Account.--The Secretary shall establish an Everglades \n     Agricultural Area Account as an account of the Commodity \n     Credit Corporation.''\n       ``(B) Area.--The Secretary shall determine the extent of \n     the Everglades Agricultural Area of Florida for the purposes \n     of subsection (i)(1)(C) and subparagraph (C).''\n       ``(C) Commodity Credit Corporation.--The funds collected \n     from the assessment provided in subsection (i)(1)(C) shall be \n     paid into the Everglades Agricultural Area Account of the \n     Commodity Credit

Mr. President, as we are about to debate the \nappointment of conferees to the reconciliation bill, I \n\n[[Page S 16510]]\n\nwanted to take this opportunity to address a relevant issue. Last \nFriday, the Senate passed landmark legislation to balance the budget \nwithin 7 years, and to restore power and trust in State and local \ngovernment.\n  During consideration of that legislation, Senator Gramm offered an \namendment regarding whether the Federal Government would dictate to \nStates that they provide health care to children and pregnant women.\n  I raise this issue because I am certain that this amendment and the \nvote will be subject to gross mischaracterization. The amendment, Mr. \nPresident, was not about whether poor children and pregnant women \nshould receive health care services. We all agree that they should, as \nI'm quite certain does every Governor in this country.\n  The vote was about whether Congress, in its arrogance, is going to \nassume that Governors and State officials cannot be depended upon to \nprotect their own constituents and, unless compelled to be \ncompassionate by Congress, they would most certainly abandon the \nneediest in their States.\n  Mr. President, I categorically reject that Governors and State \nlegislators care less about their people than Congress. That is why I \nvoted for the Gramm amendment. We are returning power to the States \nbecause, to the detriment of our Nation, we have slowly abandoned \nJefferson's time honored axiom that the Government closest to the \npeople governs best.\n  In devolving power back to the States as we rightfully should, we \nmust also devolve our trust. Members of Congress are not morally \nsuperior beings to State and local officials and it is time we stopped \npresuming that we are.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/11/01/senate-section/article/S16509-5", "month": "11", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "01", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S16510]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   TRIBUTE TO PETER ZUANICH, RETIRING PORT OF BELLINGHAM COMMISSIONER\n\n Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, it is with great pleasure that I \nrise today to pay tribute to Peter Zuanich, a man who has devoted 43 \nyears of his life to serving as an elected commissioner of the Port of \nBellingham, in my home State of Washington. His record of public \nservice extends beyond his work as port commissioner; he has dedicated \ntime and resources to building our community in so many other \ncapacities.\n  During his tenure in this post, he has cultivated economic and trade \nrelations both domestically and internationally. In particular, he has \nfostered economic relations between the states of Washington and \nAlaska. Under his leadership, the port was successful in its bid to \nbecome the southern ferry terminus for the Alaska Marine Highway \nSystem.\n  Throughout his entire career as commissioner, Mr. Zuanich did not \nspend any of the earnings he received. Instead, he invested them, \nbelieving they should eventually be spent on an important community \nproject. He recently donated the entire amount--about $88,000--to a \nfund created to raise money for the construction of a local community \nswimming pool.\n  In addition to his many accomplishments as port commissioner, Mr. \nZuanich has served as president of a variety of groups, including the \nboard of directors of the Purse Seine Vessels Association, the \nexecutive board of the Commercial Fisherman's Inter-Insurance Agency, \nthe Bellingham Jaycees, and the Washington Public Ports Association.\n  I admire the foresight Mr. Zuanich exhibited in his early involvement \nwith the recycling industry. During the 1950's, he founded the first \nwaste paper recycling facility in western Canada. His activism in this \narea has continued, through the establishment of recycling centers \nthroughout our community, and I want to thank him for his efforts in \nthis area.\n  He has been recognized in these professional and community \ninvolvements in many ways, winning the Bellingham Jaycees' Man of the \nYear Award, receiving the Master Mariner Award of the Propeller Club, \naccepting a Legislative Citation in 1993 from the Alaska State \nLegislature, and receiving a ``Citation of Merit'' award from the \nWashington Parks and Recreation Association.\n  Born in Bellingham, WA in 1916, he has worked tirelessly to promote \nthe development of our community. Following his retirement, Mr. Zuanich \nwill have more time to spend with his family, including his wife Marie \nand two sons, Robert and Peter, Jr.\n   I am proud to salute the leadership and dedication Mr. Zuanich has \ndemonstrated throughout his life. Although he will be retiring on \nDecember 31, I am certain his record of selfless service will continue \nfar into the years ahead. His hard work and philanthropy truly make him \na role model for all. Mr. Zuanich, please accept my best wishes as you \nenter not only the conclusion of one of your careers, but the beginning \nof a new chapter of your life.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/11/01/senate-section/article/S16510-1", "month": "11", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "01", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S16510]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       STRIKER REPLACEMENT ISSUE\n\n Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I ask that the March 13, 1995, \neditorial from the Washington Post regarding President Clinton's \nExecutive order prohibiting the use of permanent replacement workers \nduring an economic strike if you do any business with the Federal \nGovernment be printed in the Record.\n  The editorial follows:\n\n               [From the Washington Post, Mar. 13, 1995]\n\n                     The Striker Replacement Issue\n\n       President Clinton and the filibustering Senate Democrats \n     are wrong on the striker replacement issue. The Senate \n     Republicans are right, and we hope a couple of Democrats can \n     sooner or later be persuaded to switch sides. Then the \n     filibuster can be broken.\n       The president has no particular history of commitment on \n     this issue. The executive order he signed, disturbing and \n     tilting settled labor law in labor's favor, was plainly an \n     effort to propitiate a constituency that couldn't get its way \n     through normal procedures. The resisting Senate Republicans \n     think that in issuing the order, the president was trying to \n     snatch what ought to be regarded as a legislative \n     prerogative, and they are determined to take it back. If not \n     on the current appropriations bill, you can expect them to do \n     it on some other. In the long run the law seems unlikely to \n     be changed; this is more a fight over symbols, the president \n     who frustrated organized labor on other issues over the last \n     two years trying now to look on the cheap like its friend.\n       The executive order would bar large federal contractors \n     from hiring permanent replacements when workers strike over \n     economic issues. That's the rule that labor had tried and \n     failed to get Congress to apply to all employers. The unions \n     argue that the ban has become necessary to protect what they \n     depict as a threatened right to strike. But it isn't because \n     of labor law that unions have lost membership and clout in \n     recent years. Rather, it's because, in part by virtue of \n     their own past actions, they find themselves in an \n     increasingly weak competitive position in a world economy. \n     The insulating change they seek in labor law would be much \n     more likely over time to make that problem worse than to make \n     it better.\n       The law is contradictory. The National labor Relations Act \n     says strikers can't be fired; the Supreme Court has \n     nonetheless ruled that they can be permanently replaced. The \n     contradiction may be healthy. By leaving labor and management \n     both at risk, the law gives each an incentive to agree. For \n     most of modern labor history, management in fact has made \n     little use of the replacement power, and labor hasn't much \n     protested it.\n       The unions say that now that's changed. The replacement \n     power has been used in a number of celebrated cases in recent \n     years, and labor is doubtless right that in some of these \n     cases it wasn't used as a last resort, but as a union-\n     breaking device from the beginning. The problem is that \n     situations also arise when strikers by their behavior forfeit \n     the right of return and ought to be permanently replaced. \n     This newspaper faced such a situation in dealing with one of \n     its own unions in the 1970s. A ban on the hiring of permanent \n     replacements goes too far. Rather than restore some lost \n     balance in labor law, as its supporters suggest, it would \n     throw the law out of balance and in the long run likely do \n     great economic harm. Maybe there are some modest changes that \n     can usefully be made in current law. But the president's \n     order ought to be reversed. He should find some other way to \n     pose as labor's champion.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/11/01/senate-section/article/S16510-2", "month": "11", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "01", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S16510-S16511]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 ZORA KRAMER BROWN'S ENERGETIC EXAMPLE\n\n Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I rise today to highlight the \naccomplishments of a Washington, DC, activist whom we should all \nemulate. If each American had 1 ounce of the intense commitment that \nZora Kramer Brown brings to her mission of seeking real solutions to \nbreast cancer, we would live in a stronger America.\n  Zora Brown, a native of Oklahoma City, OK, is founder and chairperson \nof Cancer Awareness Program Services [CAPS] and the Breast Cancer \nResource Committee, both located in Washington, DC. With CAPS, which \n\n[[Page S 16511]]\n\nwas organized in 1992, Ms. Brown started a comprehensive program to \nbuild cancer awareness and education efforts among women. Three years \nearlier, she started the Breast Cancer Resource Committee to cut breast \ncancer mortality rates in half among African-Americans by the year \n2000.\n  Ms. Brown also has been appointed to the National Cancer Advisory \nBoard of the National Cancer Institute. Last year in my hometown, she \nbrought unbounded energy to Charleston as she emceed the First Annual \nRace for the Cure. More importantly, she now is a member of the board \nof the Hollings Cancer Center at the Medical University of South \nCarolina where her leadership and enthusiasm is contagious.\n  On October 27, 1995, McDonald's recognized Ms. Brown's efforts in a \nlarge ad featuring ``Portraits of the City.'' Her story of hard work \nand zeal shows how one person can make a difference in improving the \nlives of Americans. She is most deserving of this honor and the dozens \nof others that have been bestowed on her.\n  Mr. President, we need more Zora Browns across the Nation. I hope as \nAmericans recognize how successful Zora has been, we all will be \nmotivated to follow in her footsteps.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/11/01/senate-section/article/S16510-3", "month": "11", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "01", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S16511-S16512]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              REUBEN COHEN\n\n Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, last week I submitted for the Record \nmy personal statement concerning Reuben Cohen--the father of my friend \nand colleague from Maine, Senator Bill Cohen--who passed away in \nBangor, ME, earlier this month.\n  Today, I would like to submit for the Record several items that \nappeared in the Bangor Daily News following Ruby's death.\n  The first is an article about Ruby's life that appeared 2 days after \nhis death.\n  The second is an editorial that pays tribute to Ruby's well-known and \nadmired work ethic.\n  And the third is an article about funeral services that were held in \nBangor which contains many appropriate statements from family and \nfriends about this remarkable man.\n  I believe these items remember Ruby as he was--someone who brought a \nlot of life into his community, and a lot of love into his family:\n  The material follows:\n\n              [From the Bangor Daily News, Oct. 11, 1995]\n\n                       Ruby Cohen Dies in Bangor\n\n\n         senator's father ran local bakery for nearly 70 years\n\n                            (By John Ripley)\n\n       Bangor.--A few years ago, Oklahoma Sen. David Boren needed \n     to talk with Maine Sen. William Cohen, his colleague on the \n     Intelligence Committee who was home in Bangor. So he called \n     Reuben Cohen, the senator's father.\n       ``Well, if you're chairman of the Intelligence Committee,'' \n     Cohen barked into the telephone, ``you should be able to find \n     him yourself.''\n       And he hung up.\n       The story is vintage Cohen.\n       Cohen--baker, husband, father of three children--died late \n     Monday. He was 86.\n       Reuben ``Ruby'' Cohen is survived by his wife of 58 years, \n     Clara; two sons, William and Robert; a daughter, Marlene \n     Beckwith; and seven grandchildren.\n       Those who knew Ruby Cohen agree that he died the way he \n     would have wanted: He was found at 9:45 p.m. by a worker at \n     his store, The Bangor Rye Bread Co., where he had been making \n     the next day's batch of rolls and bagels.\n       To many, Cohen is known best as the father of Bill, now the \n     state's senior U.S. senator. But as proud as he was of his \n     eldest son and all of his children, Cohen enjoyed a \n     reputation of his own as a man of ornery independence, who \n     wasn't above a little mischief every now and then.\n       In 1974, when the U.S. House of Representatives was \n     deciding whether to impeach President Nixon for his Watergate \n     shenanigans, the press followed then-Rep. William Cohen to \n     Maine, dogging him about how he would vote.\n       The young congressman shrugged off the questions with ``no \n     comment.'' Then, from the rear of the pack, came a gravelly \n     voice.\n       ``Billy says he's guilty as hell!''\n       It was Ruby Cohen.\n       He was a throwback to the days of smoky pool halls, \n     Saturday night fights and dollar haircuts, when Bangor was a \n     cauldron of ethnic neighborhoods and when friends were \n     friends for life. Like many men of his generation, Cohen was \n     held in awe by those who watched him work 18 hours a day, six \n     days a week, for nearly 70 years.\n       Hunched over and with hands like shoe leather at the end of \n     his beefy baker's forearms, Cohen would start his day as \n     everyone else's was ending.\n       Work would begin around 8:30 p.m., when he would prepare \n     the dough for the bulkie rolls, rye bread, French bread, \n     Italian sandwich rolls, and bagels. Surrounded by 100-pound \n     sacks of flour, sugar and corn meal, he would work quietly \n     through the night, guided by recipes long ago committed to \n     memory.\n       Early the next morning, he would pile overflowing paper \n     grocery bags into the back of his battered station wagon and \n     head out on his rounds. He would shuffle into a client's \n     store or restaurant, drop off his goods, occasionally sit \n     down for a quick cup of piping-hot coffee, and then be on his \n     way.\n       ``I guess you could say he worked to live and lived to \n     work,'' Sen. Cohen said Tuesday after flying home from \n     Washington, D.C. ``He wanted to work until he died, and he \n     did.''\n       With little prodding, Cohen could be lured into \n     conversation, treating everyone to his unhesitating opinions \n     on everything from the big bang theory to Celtics basketball \n     to Workers' Compensation.\n       Despite the ravages of age and occasional illness, Cohen \n     could never be kept from his work.\n       In April 1979, a train derailed near Cohen's shop on \n     Hancock Street, leading police to block off the neighborhood. \n     Cohen somehow was able to sneak in, grab some rolls, and head \n     out as always.\n       When his son was sworn into the U.S. Senate, Cohen \n     grudgingly flew down to Washington, watched the ceremony, \n     then returned to work.\n       ``That's the only time he ever went down,'' Sen. Cohen \n     said.\n       Even on Tuesday, as family and friends grieved Cohen's \n     passing, the rolls and breads were delivered.\n       ``When you think of Bangor, you think of the standpipe, the \n     Paul Bunyan statue, and Ruby Cohen,'' said U.S. Rep. John \n     Baldaccis, a lifelong friend.\n       The Baldaccis, as with a handful of other families in town, \n     go back more than half a century with the Cohens. \n     Grandfathers knew grandfathers, fathers knew fathers, some \n     know sons.\n       A lover of jazz, Cohen was known in his younger years as a \n     sharp dresser who would dance the night away at the old \n     Chateau ballroom, now the site of a renovation project across \n     from City Hall. Though not a large man, he could be \n     fearless--he once decked a man who later became a bodyguard \n     for a California mobster.\n       It was at a dance hall that he met Clara, then a 16-year-\n     old Irish girl. They courted, and then married in 1937--not a \n     small thing for a Jewish man in those days.\n       ``I guess he wasn't too much concerned about what anyone \n     thought about it,'' Sen. Cohen said.\n       To Cohen, life was about devotion to work, family and \n     friends.\n       For years, he and Clara would eat dinner at different \n     restaurants with Abe and Frieda Miller, his childhood \n     friends.\n       Like his own son, Bobby, Ruby followed in his father's \n     flour-dusted footsteps. Born Jan. 8, 1909, in New York City, \n     Ruby was essentially raised in Bangor, where his father, who \n     emigrated from Russia, owned a bakery. As with Bangor Rye \n     Bread, the New York Model Bakery was a family affair, where \n     everyone chipped in to bake bread in an old, coal-fired oven.\n       ``It's a family of hard workers,'' Frieda Miller said.\n       Cohen expected the same of his own children.\n       Bobby still works at the store, Marlene is married to \n     another baker, and Bill is known to lend a hand when he's in \n     town from Washington.\n       ``Billy works here once in a while . . . when he's \n     campaigning,'' Ruby once joked.\n       Sen. Cohen often tells of scoring 43 points in a high \n     school basketball game at Bangor Auditorium. Expecting praise \n     from his father, Ruby instead replied, ``If you hadn't missed \n     those two foul shots, you'd've had 45!''\n       Over the years, the Cohen bakeries could be found on Essex \n     Street and then on Hancock, not far from the current \n     location. Through it all--the Depression, World War II, urban \n     renewal, generations come and gone--Cohen was a fixture in \n     the Queen City.\n       ``I was bred on his bread,'' Bangor restaurateur Sonny \n     Miller said Tuesday. ``Ruby was just one of a kind--just a \n     real fine gentleman.''\n       At his father's 80th birthday party in 1989, Sen. Cohen \n     arranged for video messages from President Reagan and \n     President-elect George Bush, among other dignitaries. As much \n     as he appreciated the attention, Cohen was a man who thought \n     as little of pretension and ego as he did of frozen bagels.\n       ``If you come out to Los Angeles and see the Dodgers,'' \n     manager Tommy Lasorda said in a telephone call that day, \n     ``I'd like to meet you.''\n       ``I hope you can,'' Cohen replied.\n       If Cohen's work ethic and wit were the stuff of reputation, \n     his driving habits were legend.\n       ``There's an old Bangor saying that you don't know Ruby \n     Cohen until he hits your car,'' U.S. Sen. Olympia Snowe once \n     joked.\n       Cohen himself once told of being stopped by a Bangor police \n     officer, who didn't know that the baker's old Ford station \n     wagon could be found traveling the city streets at all hours \n     of night and day.\n       Suspecting that Cohen might have been drinking, the cop \n     asked the octogenarian to recite the alphabet. Cohen did--\n     backward.\n       Only in recent months, as his health began to slip, did \n     Cohen relent and allow someone else to drive on the morning \n     rounds.\n\n[[Page S 16512]]\n\n       With their father's passing, Bobby and the others hope to \n     follow tradition and keep the bakery open, Sen. Cohen said.\n       But Bangor, he said, has tasted the last of Ruby Cohen's \n     rye bread.\n       ``That was something that went with him.''\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n                               Ruby Cohen\n\n       For the high and mighty, the most dangerous man in Bangor \n     was the baker at the wheel of the station wagon.\n       Making morning rounds with rolls and rye loaves, Ruby Cohen \n     could cut to the core on issues and people, and often did. \n     His insight, like his skill at the oven, was sharpened by \n     constant use.\n       There is a fearlessness, a strength, a virtue that comes \n     from devoting 18 hours a day, six days a week to labor. It's \n     a license to speak your mind, with candor. It's courage that \n     comes from character.\n       Cohen's outspokenness shocked the eavesdropper at the \n     corner market. The man from the station wagon, arms wrapped \n     around bags of bulkie rolls, would walk in at mid-\n     conservation and unload on the counter and on a program or \n     politician. Those close to him respected his power, and were \n     in awe of it. One of his sons, Sen. William Cohen, a man not \n     easily flustered or impressed, was visibly on guard in the \n     presence of his father. Playing straight man to Ruby was a \n     lifelong learning experience that involved some pain.\n       Beneath the crust, Cohen was a man of wit and profound work \n     ethic. His weakness as a role model for finding purpose and \n     dignity in labor is that in its pursuit he set an impossible \n     pace. Few of his own generation could keep up. To his last \n     day on the job he loved, he was an exemplar of the American \n     dream.\n       Seventy years a baker, 58 years a husband and father of \n     three, Cohen was the epitome of the individual who became \n     a local institution. He could humble the powerful, charm \n     the casual acquaintance and feed the hungry with the \n     world's most perfect loaf of rye bread.\n       He helped give his city its character. He is missed.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n                     Ruby's Friends Offer Farewell\n\n\n                    funeral recalls a bangor legend\n\n                            (By John Ripley)\n\n       Bangor.--Bangor bid a bittersweet farewell Thursday to the \n     wryest Reuben in town.\n       Reuben Cohen, known to presidents and plebes alike as \n     ``Ruby,'' died Monday night at the place he loved most, the \n     small Bangor Rye Bread Co. bakery he had owned since 1929. He \n     was 86.\n       ``In the Jewish view, if this was his time, God allowed \n     death to be a soft kiss rather than a prolonged suffering,'' \n     Rabbi Joseph Schonberger said during Cohen's funeral Thursday \n     afternoon.\n       Outside Bangor, Cohen was known best as the father of U.S. \n     Sen. William S. Cohen. But within this small community, \n     particularly within the dwindling company of his own \n     generation, Cohen was cherished for his well-honed wit and \n     his iron constitution.\n       On an Indian summer day, the Beth Israel Synagogue was \n     filled with Ruby's people--Jews, gentiles, blacks, whites, \n     the young, the old, the famous and the anonymous.\n       And with so many funerals for colorful people, those who \n     attended Cohen's service came to weep, but left laughing, \n     grateful to have shared a slice of such an encompassing life.\n       Outwardly, Cohen was a simple baker who loved dancing and \n     the saxophone, his work and his family. But as Sen. Cohen \n     pointed out, his father also was one to dismantle barriers. \n     He broke with his faith to marry his Irish sweetheart, Clara, \n     and he was well informed on the issues of the day.\n       The essence of Cohen, Schonberger said, was the essence of \n     friendship itself; breaking bread together is older than the \n     ages.\n       His work ethic was legendary--18 hours a day, six days a \n     week, for nearly 70 years. When his son and fellow baker, \n     Bobby, finally decided to take a vacation after 30 years at \n     Bangor Rye, Cohen asked, ``What's he going to do with a week \n     off?'' Sen. Cohen recalled.\n       But as the world about him whizzed by, Ruby Cohen kept true \n     to his core; he was, Sen Cohen said, a man who knew no envy.\n       ``He was an innocent in a world grown selfish and \n     cynical,'' Sen. Cohen said in a eulogy marked by moving \n     poetry and knee-slapping Rubyisms.\n       At times, Sen. Cohen pointed out, his father sometimes \n     showed a knack for being a little too innocent.\n       If a person expressed pride for losing 20 pounds, Cohen \n     thought nothing of suggesting a trim of 10 or 15 more. He \n     once loudly complained that Boston Celtics games were fixed, \n     even as coach Red Auerbach sat nearby, redder than ever.\n       And though an honest man, Cohen ``cheated the law in the \n     little ways,'' Sen. Cohen said.\n       He would envelop his eldest son in a large wool overcoat \n     and sneak him into basketball games at the old Bangor \n     Auditorium. Or, he might simply mingle with the out-going \n     crowd and walk in backward.\n       If one of Bangor's finest stopped him for erratic driving--\n     an occurence about as common as sunrises--Cohen would admit \n     to having two drinks. After the cop had set up a sobriety \n     test, Cohen would come clean: ``I had two, two cups of \n     coffee.''\n       ``I loved him for his daring, and his wanting me to be with \n     him,'' said Sen. Cohen.\n       His father's irreverence often was best expressed in his \n     relished role as devil's advocate: alimony was ``all-the-\n     money''; Jesus knew where the rocks were when he walked on \n     water; and Moses probably waited for a drought before \n     crossing the Red Sea.\n       Through it all, Sen. Cohen said, his father dedicated his \n     life to two loves: his family and his work. When the cost of \n     flour and yeast rose over the years, the increases rarely \n     were reflected in the prices of Cohen's products.\n       ``His concern was always for the welfare of his \n     customers,'' Sen. Cohen said, suggesting that some of the \n     customers could afford a price increase or two. ``And I would \n     say, `Sonny Miller is doing OK. Bill Zoidas is doing fine. \n     Doug Brown, don't cry for him.' ''\n       The future of some of these products, known to at least \n     three generations of Bangor residents, was buried with Cohen \n     on Thursday afternoon.\n       Since Cohen's death Monday night, Rabbi Schonberger joked, \n     the oft-heard question has been, ``Did he make the sourdough \n     for the rye bread before he died?'' \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/11/01/senate-section/article/S16511-1", "month": "11", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "01", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S16512]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nDIAMOND JUBILEE ANNIVERSARY OF THE TABERNACLE MISSIONARY BAPTIST CHURCH\n\n Mr. LEVIN.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nattached article be printed in the Record.\n  The article follows:\n\n                [From the Washington Post, Aug. 6, 1995]\n\n   Casinos Not a Sure Bet, Other States Discover--Analysts Say Area \n      Officials Could Learn From Successes and Failures Elsewhere\n\n                         (By Charles Babington)\n\n       Anchored on the Mississippi River near downtown New Orleans \n     are two massive, double-decker casino boats with the \n     evocative names Crescent City Queen and Grand Palais.\n       There's nothing grand about them now, however. Both boats \n     closed their doors last month, barely nine weeks after \n     opening amid much hoopla and hope. The closings, forced by \n     lower-than-expected revenue, left 1,800 people jobless and \n     the City of New Orleans jockeying with other creditors to \n     collect $3 million in unpaid taxes and fees.\n       The turn of events has been sobering--even on Bourbon \n     Street--and may give pause to officials in Maryland, \n     Virginia, the District and elsewhere who are contemplating \n     legalizing casinos. Although some southern and midwestern \n     towns are content with their riverboat revenue, others are \n     finding that the reality does not always match the promise.\n       That's especially true in New Orleans, a city that bears \n     watching by the likes of Baltimore and Washington, according \n     to several analysts. Aside from the loss of the two riverboat \n     casinos, New Orleans's ambitious land-based casino has needed \n     only a third of its projected revenue since opening in May.\n       The picture is brighter in the Midwest. One reason, \n     however, is that lawmakers quickly \n\n[[Page S 16513]]\n\n     relaxed regulations that had made casinos politically \n     palatable in the first place. In Davenport, Iowa, a riverboat \n     casino netted $14 million last year after legislators \n     increased its operating hours and dropped a rule that had \n     limited each gambler's loss to $200 a visit.\n       Those changes lured thousands of gamblers from a nearby \n     casino boat in Rock Island, Ill. As a result, more than 200 \n     people lost jobs there, and Rock Island now receives only a \n     fraction of the $4 million in casino tax revenue that it got \n     two years ago.\n       In Missouri, six riverboat casinos poured $79 million into \n     state and local tax coffers last year. Again, looser \n     regulations helped. Slot machines--initially banned in \n     Missouri--were added to the table games.\n       A political cloud is looming, however. Missouri's attorney \n     general alleges that the state House speaker broke the law by \n     accepting thousands of dollars from casino companies and \n     trying to influence licensing decisions. A grand jury is \n     investigating.\n       Against this national backdrop, Maryland is preparing for a \n     legislative decision on casinos this winter, a D.C. group has \n     asked the elections board to place a casino initiative on the \n     District's 1996 ballot, and an industry-backed coalition is \n     still pushing for riverboat casinos in Virginia after three \n     consecutive legislative setbacks.\n       Industry analysis conclude that under the right \n     circumstances, casinos can boost local economies and \n     government coffers, sometimes dramatically. But they say \n     casinos are not a panacea for politicians hoping to \n     revitalize a failing city or finance a state government while \n     cutting taxes.\n       ``Although casinos are spreading to more states, they have \n     limited potential as a source of tax revenue,'' said Steven \n     D. Gold, director of the Center for the Study of the States, \n     in Albany, N.Y. Casinos take some money that otherwise would \n     be spent on state lotteries or taxable goods and services, he \n     said. Moreover, the growing number of casinos nationwide will \n     result in smaller potential for new ones.\n       ``There will never be another Nevada,'' Gold wrote \n     recently. Nor, experts say, will there be another Atlantic \n     City, where a dozen large casinos attract bus loads of \n     betters to an otherwise blighted town.\n       Since 1990, six midwestern and southern states have \n     legalized commercial, non-Indian casinos. (Federally \n     recognized Indian tribes can operate casinos without state \n     approval or tax assessments, and the casinos are highly \n     successful in Connecticut and elsewhere.)\n       The six states are the guinea pigs now being scrutinized by \n     cities and states trying to decide whether casinos are a good \n     public bet. Among the groups conducting inquires are a \n     government-appointed task force in Maryland and the Greater \n     Washington Board of Trade. Casino companies are keen on the \n     Washington area because it would help them crack the untapped \n     mid-Atlantic region.\n       In Maryland, proposals range from a few small casinos, \n     possibly at horse-racing tracks or in mountain counties, to \n     large betting palaces in downtown Baltimore and the Port-\n     America site in Prince George's County, near the Woodrow \n     Wilson Bridge. If Baltimore and the D.C. suburbs are the \n     ultimate targets, several analysis say, then New Orleans \n     might be the most analogous site for scrutiny. Like Baltimore \n     and the District, it is a city with a well established \n     tourist trade but serious problems of crime and middle-class \n     flight.\n       In 1991 and 1992, when Louisiana legislators approved 15 \n     floating casinos throughout the state and one large land-\n     based casino in New Orleans, boosters said gambling would be \n     a sure-fire winner.\n       In the last four months, however, three of New Orlean's \n     five floating casinos have closed, eliminating the jobs of \n     hundreds of people who thought the boats would bring them a \n     better life. Meanwhile, Harrah's temporary land-based casino \n     has earned about $12 million a month, far short of the $33 \n     million that was projected. The company is building a \n     mammoth, permanent casino that officials hope will draw more \n     gamblers when it opens next summer in the heart of the \n     touristy French Quarter.\n       Some critics say the setbacks are the inevitable result of \n     Louisiana's greed and haste in approving casinos, a process \n     that enriched several friends of the high-stakes gambling \n     governor, Edwin Edwards.\n       ``It's the same scam going on worldwide'', said New Orleans \n     lawyer C.B. Forgotson, Jr.\n       Forgotson said casino companies promise the moon without \n     conducting realistic studies of who will come to gamble. \n     Eventually, he said, ``they find out the only people coming \n     to casinos are locals. So then you are cannibalizing your \n     local businesses. . . . The same thing is going to happen in \n     Detroit and Baltimore.''\n       Other analysts, however, say New Orleans is temporarily \n     suffering from foolish decisions that other states can avoid.\n       ``The root of the problem is that the wrong people were \n     licensed, and they were licensed for political reasons,'' \n     said Larry Pearson, publisher of the New Orleans-based \n     Riverboat Gaming Report. He noted that river boat casinos in \n     other parts of Louisiana are doing well.\n       Only a few states have been willing to try a non-Indian, \n     land-based casino. In Mississippi and the four midwestern \n     states with casinos, the facilities must be on boats, even \n     though some never leave the dock.\n       Many analysis say ``riverboat gambling'' is a political \n     ploy to ease the worries of some voters who associate land-\n     based casinos with Las Vega's tackiness and Atlantic City's \n     grit. ``State legislators think that a little cruise with a \n     paddle wheel somehow makes it not gambling,'' said Brian \n     Ford, a Philadelphia-based casino adviser for the accounting \n     firm Ernst & Young.\n       Some analysts argue that if Washington and Baltimore want \n     casinos, they should build big Vegas-like facilities that \n     could lure tourists and large conventions.\n       ``Scattering some riverboats around the Washington-\n     Baltimore area would be a disaster,'' said Hunter Barrier, \n     director of the Alexandria-based Gaming and Economic \n     Development Institute. Most tourists would ignore such \n     facilities, he said, ``so revenues will come from local \n     residents. And that money would come from restaurants, \n     theaters and other local businesses.''\n       It is just that scenario that has prompted Maryland's \n     restaurant and thoroughbred racing industries to unite \n     against casinos. They say casinos typically support bettors \n     with cheap food and a fast-paced array of slot machines and \n     card game that make horse races seem poky.\n       ``Casinos would have a devastating impact on our \n     industry,'' said Marcia Harris, of the Restaurant Association \n     of Maryland.\n       Despite opposition to casinos from racing and restaurant \n     interests, politicians in Maryland and elsewhere are tempted \n     for a simple reason. Tax rates on casino earnings are \n     typically about 20 percent, four times the level of \n     Maryland's 5 percent sales tax. If a resident spends $100 in \n     a casino rather than in a clothing store, the store suffers, \n     but the state receives $20 rather than $5.\n       Barrier said most governments that are contemplating \n     casinos focus on three concerns: crime, compulsive gambling \n     and ``product substitution,'' or the losses to non-casino \n     businesses when their customers gamble.\n       ``I've come to the conclusion that crime is not a \n     problem,'' Barrier said, an opinion supported by several \n     studies and interviews with police officials in towns with \n     riverboat casinos. But problem gambling, he said, is \n     ``something that has to be looked at real carefully.''\n       Problem gambling is hard to measure, authorities say, and \n     casino supporters note that most Americans already have ample \n     opportunities to bet on lotteries and other ventures. \n     However, a 1994 study of legalized gambling, funded by the \n     Aspen Institute, a D.C. think tank, and the Ford Foundation, \n     concluded: ``There is a direct increase in the numbers of \n     people with pathological gambling problems as a result of \n     increases in legalization.''\n       As for product substitution, a debate rages. Casino \n     supporters say everyone in a community benefits if casinos \n     hire new workers, attract tourist dollars and contribute to \n     higher tax revenue.\n       There's not much hard data on the subject. In South Dakota, \n     where Indian casinos operate, a 1991 state study found no \n     appreciable drop in overall taxable retail sales. However, \n     there were ``significant declines for selected activities \n     such as clothing stores, recreation services, business \n     services, auto dealers and service stations.''\n       When casinos open, ``existing vendors lose,'' said Jeff \n     Finkle, executive director of the Washington-based National \n     Council of Urban Economic Development. Nonetheless, he \n     predicts that Maryland and Virginia officials will find it \n     hard to withstand the lure of casino revenue, especially if \n     Pennsylvania, West Virginia or Delaware threaten to strike \n     first.\n       ``Somebody in this area is going to do it,'' Finkle told a \n     Greater Washington Board of Trade task force last week. ``It \n     is inevitable, and when it happens it will hurt D.C.'' unless \n     a revenue-sharing agreement is reached.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/11/01/senate-section/article/S16512-2", "month": "11", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "01", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S16513-S16514]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   THE PROFESSIONAL BOXING SAFETY ACT\n\n Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, the Senate's passage of the \nProfessional Boxing Safety Act represents the culmination of nearly 4 \nyears of working to make professional boxing a safer sport for the \nyoung men who choose to enter the ring. In large part, these efforts \nowe a great deal to a boxer from my home State of Delaware, whose \nmisfortune and subsequent hard work made a lot of this possible. That \nboxer is Dave Tiberi and I believe that both the Senate and the \nAmerican public owe a debt of gratitude to Dave for the legislation we \nhave adopted.\n  On February 8, 1992, in a world title fight, Dave Tiberi lost a \ncontroversial split decision in Atlantic City to the International \nBoxing Federation's middleweight champion, James Toney. The ABC \nannouncer described it as ``the most disgusting decision I have ever \nseen.'' As a result of that fight, I directed that the Permanent \nSubcommittee on Investigations undertake a comprehensive investigation \nof professional boxing, the first in the Senate in more than 30 years. \nUnfortunately, that investigation found that the sport's problems \nremained much as Senator Kefauver found them to be three decades \nearlier.\n  First and foremost among all the problems facing the sport today, \nnone is more important that protecting the \n\n[[Page S 16514]]\n\nhealth and safety of professional boxers. We work hard to protect our \namateur boxers and take great pride in their accomplishments in the \nOlympics. Yet, when these and other young men step into the \nprofessional ranks, we deny them even the most basic health and safety \nprotections such as minimum uniform national standards. Professional \nboxers are faced with a patchwork system of health and safety \nregulations that vary State by State, both by rule and enforcement.\n  Along with my colleague, Senator Dorgan, I have worked to ensure that \nthe legislation we have adopted does include minimum uniform national \nhealth and safety standards. This will ensure that every professional \nboxing match in the United States is conducted under these standards. \nEvery professional boxer will know that a physician must be at \nringside; that an ambulance must be available; and that promoters must \nprovide medical insurance. I commend Senator McCain and Senator Bryan, \nthe sponsors of S. 187, for including these health and safety \nprotections in this legislation.\n  Despite numerous lucrative offers, Dave Tiberi has never fought \nagain. Instead, he has dedicated his efforts to reforming boxing and \nworking with young people in Delaware. I believe that, in large part, \nwithout Dave Tiberi's work, we would not have passed this boxing reform \nlegislation.\n  Professional boxing is important not only to its millions of fans, \nbut also because the sport creates opportunities for many young men who \nhave few opportunities. We owe these young men a system outside the \nring that works as hard to protect them as they do inside the ring. \nThat is why I have worked to reform professional boxing and I commend \nmy colleagues for adopting this important legislation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/11/01/senate-section/article/S16513-1", "month": "11", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "01", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S16514-S16515]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   THE PROFESSIONAL BOXING SAFETY ACT\n\n Mr. McCAIN.

S. 187 is an effective and practical measure that \nwill strengthen and expand the health and safety precautions to protect \nthe welfare of professional boxers. It will also go a long way toward \nenhancing the integrity of the sport.\n  I am deeply grateful for the strong support that Senator Richard \nBryan of Nevada has lent to this effort. As prime cosponsor of S. 187 \nand as a Senator representing America's premier boxing State, Senator \nBryan's assistance on this issue has been vital to its progress.\n  I would also like to thank Senators Pressler and Senator Roth for \ncosponsoring this bill. Chairman Pressler helped move S. 187 through \nthe Commerce Committee, and Senator Roth has been a leader in bringing \nthe issue of boxing reform before the Senate. Senator Roth and Senator \nDorgan helped strengthen the bill with additional health and safety \nprovisions, as well.\n  I would like to speak for a moment on why the passage of boxing \nlegislation is an important and necessary step for the Senate to take. \nAptly described as ``the Red Light District of Sports'' some 70 years \nago, professional boxing has continued to be an industry rife with \ncontroversy and scandal.\n  I have been an avid fan of boxing since I was a teenager, and I look \nback fondly on my days of painful mediocrity as a boxer at the U.S. \nNaval Academy. I idolized Sugar Ray Robinson, and have closely followed \nthe many great champions and challengers who have followed in his wake. \nAt its best, professional boxing can be a riveting and honorable \ncontest between athletes.\n  Unfortunately, this standard of honorable competition is often \nignored with respect to boxing in America today. Boxing continues to be \ncorrupted by woefully inadequate safety precautions, fraudulent \nmismatches, and unethical business practices. The boxing industry has \nbeen justifiably tarnished in the public's eye due to individuals whose \nprofit motives consistently outweigh their conscience.\n  Instead of the health and welfare of each boxer being paramount, many \nprofessional boxers are treated as sacrificial workhorses whose long-\nterm interests do not count. This is especially true for the unknown \nclub fighters who are the backbone of the sport. They live far out of \nthe glare of the media spotlight, and box because it is the only way \nthey know to make a living. A majority of professional boxers never \nmake more than a few hundred dollars per bout during their entire \ncareers.\n  Many boxers are routinely subjected to excessive punishment and \ninjury in poorly supervised events. These bootleg shows feature \ndangerous mismatches and few if any health or safety precautions. \nInstead of being allowed to heal during a mandatory recuperation \nperiod, injured boxers are often lured to another State to avoid the \nsuspension. Finally, when they are too old or debilitated to even \nattempt to compete, journeymen boxers are quickly dismissed from the \nsport.\n  There is no pension or medical assistance awaiting most boxers once \nthey hang up their gloves. Indeed, their retirement often consists of \nnothing more than a steady and irreversible decline of their body and \nmind. This sad fate has faced literally thousands of boxers in America, \nand my overriding objective in introducing S. 187 is to prevent it from \nhappening to future generations of boxers.\n  There are two major reasons these abuses have not been curbed. The \nfirst is the absence of a private governing body in the industry to \nmandate proper safety regulations and ethical guidelines. Second, the \nState-by-State nature of boxing regulation in America allows promoters \nto hold unsafe boxing shows in States with weak or nonexistent boxing \nregulations.\n  The Professional Boxing Safety Act will end this disturbing situation \nin an efficient and nonobtrusive manner. S. 187 will achieve the single \nmost important step to make boxing safer: requiring State boxing \nofficials to responsibly evaluate and supervise every professional \nboxing event held in the United States. Public oversight by State \nofficials is absolutely essential to protect the health and safety of \nboxers.\n  We simply cannot allow the business interests which dominate the \nboxing industry to sanction and supervise events which they themselves \norganize and promote. The final authority for the content and conduct \nof each boxing event must rest with State athletic officials--not \npromoters or sanctioning bodies. State boxing officials are responsible \nfor protecting both the welfare of the boxers and serving the public's \ninterest, and S. 187 will greatly assist them in this important work.\n   Let me briefly describe the major provisions of this bill. First, \nall boxing events must be reviewed and officially approved by State \nboxing commissioners. If a State does not have a boxing commission--and \ncurrently six States in the United States do not--commissioners from a \nneighboring State must be brought in to supervise the event at the \nexpense of the promoter.\n  Second, each boxer competing in the United States will receive an \nidentification card which will be tied into the private boxing \nregistries which serve the industry. This will assist State \ncommissioners in evaluating the career record and medical condition of \neach boxer coming to their State to compete.\n  Furthermore, S. 187 requires all commissioners and promoters to honor \nthe medical suspensions of boxers that have been ordered by other State \ncommissions. This means no boxer can compete while suspended due to a \nrecent knockout, injury, or need for a medical procedure. Commissioners \nwill also be required to promptly share the results of the boxing shows \nthey supervise with commissioners from other States.\n  Several additional health and safety provisions were added to S. 187 \nbefore it was passed by the full Senate. Licensed physicians must be \ncontinuously present at ringside for all boxing events, and an \nambulance service must either be present at the site or have been \nnotified of the event. Promoters are required to provide medical \ninsurance for each boxer, as well. The \n\n[[Page S 16515]]\n\namount required will be left up to the discretion of each State.\n  These reasonable measures are already required by most State \ncommissions, but establishing them as national standards will protect \nthose boxers competing in less carefully regulated jurisdictions.\n  The U.S. attorneys in each State will enforce S. 187. The bill will \nempower U.S. attorneys to seek a temporary or permanent injunction \nagainst individuals violating this act. This will bolster State \ncommissioners to resist the intimidation that results in dangerous and \nfraudulent professional boxing events.\n  Let me clearly emphasize what this legislation does not do. Unlike \nother boxing reform proposals that have been introduced in the Congress \nover the last decade, S. 187 requires no new Federal or State tax \ndollars; establishes no Federal boxing bureaucracy; and imposes no \nburdensome regulations upon State officials.\n  I am very pleased that S. 187 has received virtually unanimous \nsupport from every sector of the boxing industry. It has been \nenthusiastically endorsed by the Association of Boxing Commissions \n[ABC], which represents 35 State boxing commissions across the United \nStates. Over 20 chief State boxing officers have written to me in \nsupport of this bill, ranging from prominent boxing States such as \nNevada, Florida, and New Jersey, to smaller commissions such as \nKentucky, Ohio, and my home State of Arizona.\n  Most important to me, however, is the enthusiastic support I have \nreceived from professional boxers themselves. They bear all the risk of \nthis violent profession, and they are the people I want to protect with \nthis legislation. Legendary champions Muhammad Ali, George Foreman, and \nSugar Ray Leonard each wrote to me in support of S. 187, and I am \ndeeply grateful to them.\n  I also want to note the special participation of two extremely \nimpressive boxing industry professionals in this effort. Mr. Eddie \nFutch, perhaps the greatest trainer of this era, and accomplished \njunior featherweight Jerome Coffee both took the time to testify on \nboxing safety before the Commerce Committee. They graced the committee \nwith their experienced views, and I again extend my sincere gratitude \nto the both of them for their contributions.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/11/01/senate-section/article/S16514-1", "month": "11", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "01", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S16515]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      SNOWBASIN LAND EXCHANGE ACT\n\n Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, yesterday Senators Hatch, Bennett, \nCraig, and I introduced S. 1371, the Snowbasin Land Exchange Act. This \nbill would facilitate a land transfer in Utah.\n  The consolidation of ownership of lands in the West has been a goal \nof many Members of the Senate, including me. I have supported many land \nexchanges for Montana, and I am pleased to be a cosponsor of S. 1371. \nThis bill deals with lands in Utah and would allow the Snowbasin ski \narea, which will be one of the sites for ski events of the 2002 Winter \nOlympic Games. The bill would transfer about 1,320 acres from the \nForest Service to the ski area and Forest Service would receive lands \nof equal value which they desire.\n  About 10 years ago, discussions began between the owners of this land \nand the Forest Service. Since 1985, there have been studies, hearings, \nand assessments on the exchange. These include an environmental impact \nstatement, environmental assessment, cultural and historical \nassessment, fish and wildlife studies, soil and water reviews, and \ngeological studies. Despite a decision made by the Forest Service to \nexchange 700 acres of land at Snowbasin in 1990, the exchange remains \nuncompleted today.\n  Congress needs to act quickly on S. 1371 so the exchange can be \ncompleted in the near future. For the 2002 Olympic Games, planning has \nalready begun. This exchange is important so the work at Snowbasin can \nbe completed for Olympic ski events scheduled there.\n  The 2002 Olympic Games are important to the people of Montana for \nmany reasons. For one, the Olympics will draw people to the Inter-\nMountain West, including Montana. This means more travel and tourism \ndollars to Montana and greater exposure of the attributes Montana \npossesses.\n  Mr. President, the Public Lands Subcommittee will hold a hearing on \nS. 1371 next week, and I look forward to this bill moving forward \nquickly.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/11/01/senate-section/article/S16515-1", "month": "11", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "01", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S16515-S16516]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  ENERGY AND WATER APPROPRIATIONS ACT\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, yesterday evening, the Senate passed the \nconference report on H.R. 1905, the Fiscal Year 1996 Energy and Water \nDevelopment Appropriations Act. I would like to comment on one aspect \nof this bill that has tremendous meaning to people in my State of \nWashington.\n  During the debate, the senior Senator from Washington made a \nstatement regarding a recent agreement between the various Members of \nthe Senate from the Pacific Northwest and the Clinton administration \nregarding the recovery of salmon runs in the Columbia and Snake Rivers. \nHe correctly pointed out the two things it represents: First, an \nacknowledgment by the administration of the need to stabilize recovery \ncosts; and, second, an interim solution that provides some breathing \nspace for the region to develop ideas for longer-term solutions.\n  My colleague also went the extra step of pointing out all the \nproblems with the status quo, problems on which there is almost no \ndisagreement. He spoke of the escalating costs of recovery measures. He \nspoke of the increasing financial pressures on Bonneville Power \nAdministration. He spoke of conflicting Federal laws. He spoke of the \ninability of the Federal Government to develop solutions that work for \na very unique region of the country. These are things on which we can \nboth agree. These are problems on which I want to work with him to \nsolve.\n  He also spoke of his goals in this debate. And again, his goals are \nsubstantially similar to mine. He spoke of the need to rebuild the once \nvibrant salmon runs which so much define the people of the Northwest \nand their culture. He wants to accomplish that soon, and so do I. He \nwants the Pacific Northwest--and the United States--to continue to \nbenefit from the magnificent Federal Columbia River Power System, and I \nthink he's right on target.\n  During his remarks, however, he drew an interesting parallel between \nthis issue and the spotted owl controversy that has vexed our region \nfor so many years. He said, in effect, that while owls are important, \nthey should not be more important than people. I do not think any \nright-thinking person ever argued that owls should be more important \nthan people; I know I have not. But most people know the real issue has \nbeen the gradual degradation of the public forests for which the owl \nbecame a symbol. The public has soundly rejected overcutting and \noverexploitation of the national forests, in favor of ecosystem \nmanagement approach currently embodied by the Northwest forest plans.\n  The senior Senator suggests that--like his approach to the spotted \nowl--we should restore fish, but not at the expense of anyone else. I \nthink that he fundamentally misjudges the differences between the \nsalmon issue and the spotted owl issue. This is not as simple as jobs \nversus owls. Unlike the owl, salmon are firmly identified with people. \nThey are part of people's basic vision of the Northwest, and they are \npart of the economic foundation on which our great State has been \nbuilt. Salmon mean jobs. They put a roof over the heads of fishers and \ntheir families. They are at the spiritual center of native American \ncultures. They are at the core of many family relationships; how many \nparents have taken their child out for his or her very first fishing \ntrip?\n  And the decline of salmon has sent a horrendous ripple effect through \nour economy, through our State, our politics, and even our \ninternational relations. The decline of salmon has driven fishers from \nWashington and Oregon up to Alaska. It has driven parents out of homes. \nIt has created tension between politicians from neighboring States. \nLawsuits have been filed. Indian peoples have threatened to enforce \ntheir treaty rights. Canada has taken a punitive line against our \nfishing boats, and our treaty with them has fallen into serious \ndispute. Why? Because the Federal Government has not taken care of our \nsalmon runs. It is as simple as that, and it's a problem we can fix.\n  My colleague from Washington correctly points out that the \nadministrative agreement reached last week to \n\n[[Page S 16516]]\n\nestablish a budget for salmon recovery is just that--a promise by the \nadministration to bring costs under control. He also expressed concern \nthat nothing has been committed to paper describing this agreement. \nThat is why I insert language into the conference report on H.R. 1905--\nwith his support--that directs the agencies involved to enter into a \nmemorandum of agreement detailing the manner in which the annual salmon \nbudget will be implemented.\n  Make no mistake: a huge amount of money will be devoted to salmon \nrecovery, and the public deserves detailed accounting of how it is \nspent. We will have accountability, or we will pull the plug. I expect \nthe National Marine Fisheries Service, the Bonneville Power \nAdministration, and the four Northwest States--either through their \nGovernors, or the Northwest Power Planning Council--to reach agreement \non the best approach to recovery, and to provide a full written \naccounting of their efforts.\n\n  How will we recover these salmon runs, when we have had so little \nsuccess to date? The answer is by following good science. The senior \nSenator and I also agree on this, though he made one comment that \ndisturbs me. He said we should not spend all this money solely to \nrecover one, two, or three weak runs of fish. Well, I agree, and I do \nnot think anyone is suggesting we should just focus on three runs. \nThere are over 80 salmon and steelhead runs in this basin, and we \nshould focus on managing the whole population to maximum advantage. \nLike the national forests that are home to the spotted owl, the health \nof the river system is in trouble. Nearly every single salmon and \nsteelhead run is trending downward in population.\n  If we examine the science as it is currently understood, we will find \nthat what is good for 1 weak run is also good for 79 others. \nFurthermore, the Northwest Power Planning Council has developed its own \nplan, and it's almost identical to that of the Federal Government. The \nonly difference is that it targets the whole basin. That is right; the \nregional, homespun salmon plan aims to rebuild all salmon runs in the \nbasin, and yet it calls for recovery measures almost identical to those \nrequired by the ESA: better passage around dams, faster travel time to \nthe ocean, habitat conservation, and decreased predation. So it is \nreasonable to conclude that scientific theories are headed in the same \ndirection for all salmon in the basin, be they listed under the \nEndangered Species Act, or not.\n  My colleague also pointed out that the region's current problems are \nthe fault of Federal laws and overzealous bureaucrats. While that is \nsurely true in part, it is not the whole story. The Endangered Species \nAct gives NMFS the responsibility to act to save salmon. It has kicked \nin as a measure of last resort, because other actions have failed. \nThere are other laws that also apply. The Northwest Power Act--written \nby our Senators Warren Magnuson, Scoop Jackson, and Mark Hatfield \nspecifically for the region--requires BPA to manage the river system to \nensure the propagation of salmon. That law set up the Northwest Power \nPlanning Council to oversee BPA.\n  It was a regional solution; but it maybe outdated, because it's no \nlonger working.\n  But that's not all. The Federal Power Act requires non-Federal dams \nto take serious measures to protect salmon before they can get an \noperating license. There are treaties with native Americans--upheld by \nthe Supreme Court of the United States as the highest law of the land--\nthat require the Government to ensure healthy salmon runs exist. And \nfinally, we have a treaty with Canada that requires each country to \nreplaced the amount of fish it takes from the other's waters.\n  What solutions have been proposed by my senior colleague? He \nconsistently has proposed shortcutting the law and tilting the balance \nof decisionmaking by limiting public involvement. His approach has been \nto find the quick fix: suspend the laws as they apply to our region, \nand impose an outcome from the Federal level. Well, more often than \nnot, that approach shortchanges the science and leads to massive \nlawsuits. He has also proposed sweeping revision to the ESA, some of \nwhich might be needed. But the fact remains, we could repeal the ESA \ntomorrow, and it would not do a thing to help restore salmon to the \nColumbia Basin.\n  It is not as simple as turning the whole mess over to the States. \nThat might get the Feds out of the picture, but it does not begin to \nsolve the problem. In the end, we need to stop addressing all Columbia \nRiver issues in isolation. Salmon costs are not BPA's only problem; \nsome might argue it is the least of its problems. BPA's biggest problem \nis how to continue delivering benefits to the people, given competitive \nchanges to energy markets. It has inefficient management, a huge debt \nload, numerous public policy mandates, very little accountability, and \nvirtually no regulatory oversight.\n  Politicians should commit to working for a series of shared values, \nand then start looking for ways to achieve them for the people. I think \nthose values remain very clear: we should have clean, affordable \nhydropower; we should have bountiful fish and wildlife; and we should \npay off the debts incurred to construct the system.\n  For fish, we need to find a way to make the requirements of all these \nlaws and treaties consistent. And then we need one plan to meet these \nrequirements. One set of standards, and one plan to meet them. We must \nutilize a scientifically sound, adaptive management approach. We must \ntest, monitor, and adapt as we learn more about salmon science. The \nfact is, salmon science is inexact. There are many different theories \non what is best for them; only by experimenting will we find the \nsolutions that work best. Our challenge is to conduct these tests in \nthe most sensible, cost effective way.\n  For the hydro system, we need to carefully reevaluate the role of \nBPA--and all its assets--as we enter the 21st century, and try to \nidentify the role that makes the most sense for consumers in the new \nmarketplace. The four Northwest Governors and the Department of Energy \nare currently planning a regional forum to review these issues. I hope \nthis forum can be used to review proposals for change coming from the \nbottom up. I have been talking with many constituents over the past \nyear, and I know much work has been done on the ground to scope out \nchanges to the law that make sense for the region. I want to see that \nwork carry over into the public arena. In my view, the Governors are \nbest positioned to bring people together, review ideas, and forward \nuseful guidance to the congressional delegation here in Washington, DC.\n  Mr. President, I have listened very closely to the people of the \nNorthwest. They want salmon runs. They want clean hydropower in favor \nof nuclear power, or coal, or even gas. But above all else, they want \nto avoid the controversies of the past like the spotted owl: they want \na solution. I am passionately committed to finding a solution that \nworks for the Northwest. People do not want to see their politicians \nbicker. They do not want to see winners and losers in public debate. \nThey want to see their politicians work together, and they want \nproblems solved.\n  The agreement reached with the Clinton administration last week was a \nsolid beginning. It was not landmark, and it certainly was not a long-\nterm solution. But it buys time for the region to think this through \nvery carefully, and it does not harm any aspect of the river system, or \nthe fish. We now have an opportunity. We can move forward, and find \nsolutions, or we can draw lines in the sand and let things devolve into \npolitics. I know the people of the Pacific Northwest want the former.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/11/01/senate-section/article/S16515-2", "month": "11", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "01", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S16516-S16523]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nNATIONAL SECURITY PROVISIONS OF THE GATT TREATY AS APPLIED TO ECONOMIC \n                               EMBARGOES\n\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, I rise today to offer a brief explanation \nof article 21 of the GATT, otherwise known as the General Agreement on \nTariffs and Trade, especially as it relates to the imposition of \nsecondary economic sanctions against Iran. This is particularly \npertinent because of my bill, S. 1228, the Iran Foreign Oil Sanctions \nAct.\n  Briefly, the provisions of article 21, are so broadly written, that \nlegislation such as S. 1228 is possible, and in fact, \n\n[[Page S 16517]]\n\nsustainable under the GATT. Furthermore, the concept has been tested \nbefore, in relative terms as it relates to economic sanctions imposed \nupon Cuba in the 1960's, Nicaragua, and even against Czechoslovakia in \nthe 1940's.\n  I want to add that even when President Reagan imposed similar \nsanctions against the Soviet Union in the 1980's, in retaliation to the \nimposition of martial law in Poland, a Federal court upheld sanctions \nagainst Dresser France.\n  I feel that this point must be made clear for those who feel that \nthere would be a challenge to this once it became law, or that it would \ncause legal disputes. In light of this, I ask unanimous consent that \nthe following documents be printed in the Record, explaining the \nlegality of secondary boycotts under the GATT: First, a memo dated June \n28, 1983, from Sherman Unger, then legal counsel for the Department of \nCommerce, on the subject of the legality of import sanctions under \nGATT; an article from the New York Times from August 25, 1982, entitled \n``Judge Backs U.S. Bid to Penalize Company on Soviet Pipeline Sale,'' \nthat details an attempt by Dresser France to defy President Reagan's \nsecondary boycott against foreign companies supplying oil pipeline \nequipment to the Soviet Union; and finally, an analytical index Guide \nto GATT Law and Practice, explaining article 21 in GATT, the national \nsecurity exception.\n  In their totality, these documents will help to explain the legality \nand I hope that they will go some way toward settling any doubts about \nS. 1228.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                            General Counsel of the\n\n\n                                  U.S. Department of Commerce,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, June 28, 1983.\n     Memorandum to Lionel H. Olmer, Under Secretary for \n       International Trade, from Sherman E. Unger, General \n       Counsel.\n\n Export Administration Act--International Legality of Proposed Import \n                                Sanction\n\n\n                                summary\n\n       Proposed amendments to the Export Administration Act would \n     authorize subjecting violators of national security export \n     controls to sanctions in the form of import restrictions. The \n     proper exercise of this authority would be consistent with \n     United States obligations under the General Agreements on \n     Tariffs and Trade (GATT) and under other potentially \n     applicable trade agreements. GATT legality would not preclude \n     the possibility of a claim of ``nullification or impairment'' \n     under GATT Article XXIII, but the relationship of such \n     sanctions to security interests and the likelihood of their \n     relatively insignificant impact on a country's exports \n     greatly reduce the risk of GATT-sanctioned counter-measures.\n\n\n                               background\n\n       The Administration bill would amend section 11 of the \n     Export Administration Act of 1979, as amended (the ``EAA'') \n     \\1\\\n     Footnotes at end of article.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n       ``(3) Whoever violates any national security control \n     imposed under section 5 of this Act, or any regulation, order \n     or license related thereto, may be subject to such controls \n     on the importing of its goods and technology into the United \n     States or its territories and possessions as the President \n     may prescribe.'' \\2\\\n       The bill reported by the Senate Banking Committee contains \n     a similar amendment, but the import controls on a violator \n     are not limited to ``its'' goods and technology, and the \n     sanction is also applicable to a violation of ``any \n     regulation issued pursuant to a multilateral agreement to \n     control exports for national security purposes, to which the \n     United States is a part.'' \\3\\\n       Under the present statute and regulations, violators of the \n     export controls under the EAA are subject to criminal \n     penalties and to administratively imposed civil fines and \n     denial or limitation of access to exports from the United \n     States.\\4\\ When a violator is outside the United States, it \n     may not be possible to acquire personal jurisdiction over \n     that person for purposes of criminal proceedings or the \n     collection of civil fines. The export control authority of \n     the EAA can be used to deny a violator access to U.S. exports \n     even if the violator elects not to contest the administrative \n     enforcement proceedings and remains outside of United States \n     territory.\\5\\ Thus, denial of export privileges may be the \n     only available sanction in certain cases. Whether this \n     sanction will provide a meaningful penalty to deter further \n     violations will depend upon the extent to which the violator \n     needs continued access to U.S.-origin goods and technology. \n     The ability to restrict imports, as well, would increase the \n     economic impact on any violator and, for some, might be key \n     to achieving an effective sanction.\n\n\n                             GATT Legality\n\n       GATT Article XI bars ``prohibitions or restrictions'' on \n     imports, with certain exceptions not applicable to the EAA \n     sanctions under consideration. Article XI applies to \n     prohibitions or restrictions on the importation of ``any \n     product of the territory of any other contracting party.'' \n     Thus, the origin of the affected imports, rather than the \n     nationality or place of business of the sanctioned violator, \n     would be controlling. Absent an exception in the GATT, an \n     affected contracting party could challenge the \n     import sanction as an illegal restraint on the exports of \n     its products to the United States.\\6\\\n       The United States would be able to defend a proper use of \n     the import sanction against violators on the basis of \n     exceptions provided in Articles XX and XXI of the GATT.\n       Among the general exceptions in Article XX is that in \n     subparagraph (d) with respect to measures ``necessary to \n     secure compliance with laws or regulations which are not \n     inconsistent with the provisions of [the GATT] . . . ''. To \n     qualify for an exception under the terms of Article XX, \n     measures must not constitute ``a means of arbitrary or \n     unjustifiable discrimination between countries where the same \n     conditions prevail'' or ``a disguised restriction on \n     international trade.''\n       It should not be subject to serious question that denial of \n     import privileges to violators would constitute a measure to \n     secure compliance with the export control laws, with the \n     likely economic consequences of such a sanction serving as a \n     deterrent. The real issue, therefore, would be whether the \n     export controls themselves are consistent with the GATT.\n       Article XI bars prohibitions or restrictions through export \n     licenses with respect to the exportation or sale for export \n     of any product destined for the territory of any other \n     contracting party. The application of this prohibition is \n     limited by exclusions stated in paragraph 2 of the Article, \n     but none of these is applicable to national security export \n     controls.\n       For purposes of this memorandum, I shall assume that the \n     import sanction is imposed in connection with a violation of \n     a control restricting the export of a product destined for \n     the territory of a contracting party. It should be noted, \n     however, that most of the controlled destinations under U.S. \n     national security controls are Communist countries that \n     are not GATT contracting parties. Where an export license \n     must be applied for in connection with an export of a \n     national security controlled product to a Free World \n     destination, the basic purpose of licensing (with limited \n     nuclear-related exceptions) is to assure that the \n     indicated destination is bona fide and that diversion to a \n     controlled destination is not in prospect. As the purpose \n     of these licensing requirements is not to deny these Free \n     World destinations access to the products, and as the \n     trade impact in fact is nil because licenses are rarely \n     denied to these destinations, it is arguable that such \n     controls are not the kind of trade practice which Article \n     XI should be deemed to prohibit. This argument would gain \n     force if Article XI were invoked in a case involving the \n     unauthorized export of a U.S.-origin product from the \n     territory of the contracting party lodging the complaint. \n     It is not unlikely that such reexport controls would be \n     involved in a complaint, as it is this jurisdictional \n     reach that distinguishes U.S. controls from those of its \n     major trading partners.\n       Even if Article XI were applicable to the national security \n     export control being enforced, the United States should be \n     able to GATT--justify its actions under the security \n     exception in Article XXI. This provides in pertinent part:\n       ``Nothing in this Agreement shall be construed . . . (b) to \n     prevent any contracting party from taking any action which it \n     considers necessary for the protection of its essential \n     security interests (i) relating to fissionable materials or \n     the materials from which they are derived; (ii) relating to \n     traffic in arms, ammunition and implements of war, and to \n     such traffic in other goods and materials as is carried on \n     directly or indirectly for the purpose of supplying a \n     military establishment; (iii) taken in time of war or other \n     emergency in international relations. . . .''\n       The use in Article XXI of the term ``which it considers \n     necessary'' is indicative of the deference to the judgment of \n     contracting parties when they wish to justify measures on \n     security grounds. The very limited testing of this Article in \n     GATT proceedings has confirmed this deference.\\7\\ Professor \n     Jackson quotes statements from the GATT preparatory \n     conference that ``some latitude must be granted for security \n     as opposed to commercial purposes'' and that ``the spirit \n     in which the Members of the Organization would interpret \n     these provisions was the only guarantee against abuse.'' \n     \\8\\ The United States invoked Article XXI in successfully \n     defending its export controls against a Czechoslovak \n     challenge in 1949. In May 1982, Argentina complained to \n     the GATT Council that the trade sanctions (not limited to \n     military or strategic items) imposed by the United \n     kingdom, the European Community, Canada and Australia \n     violated various GATT requirements and could not be \n     justified under Article XXI. The complaint remains \n     unresolved.\n       The scarcity of official interpretations of Article XXI is \n     due not only to the very few complaints in which it has been \n     invoked, but also to the fact that the broad wording of the \n     Article XXI exception relieves contracting parties of the \n     obligation to provide notification of security-related \n     measures.\n\n[[Page S 16518]]\n\n       If the GATT were to be invoked with respect to controls on \n     industrial goods being exported for industrial use, it might \n     be contended that the controls are not within the Article XXI \n     reference to traffic in ``other goods and materials . . . \n     carried on directly or indirectly for the purpose of \n     supplying a military establishment.'' Weighing strongly \n     against the success of any such contention, however, is the \n     fact that, from the earliest years of the GATT, the United \n     States and the major industrialized countries of the West \n     have operated a coordinated system of export controls with \n     very broad product coverage and often with little or no \n     concern as to whether supply of a military establishment was \n     involved. In fact, in the early years of the GATT, Western \n     embargoes of Communist countries were not confined to \n     strategic goods, but included common industrial raw \n     materials, so as to impair the growth of the economic base \n     that could support a military effort. The targets of these \n     controls included Czechoslovakia, a GATT contracting party.\n       If there is little likelihood of a successful GATT \n     challenge to the security-related export control measure \n     itself, might import sanctions imposed against a violator of \n     that control nonetheless be found to be ``arbitrary or \n     unjustifiable discrimination between countries'' or a \n     ``disguised restriction on international trade'', preventing \n     justification under the Article XX general exception? GATT \n     negotiating history is not helpful in interpreting \n     these provisions.\\9\\ Import sanctions are unlikely to be \n     overtly discriminatory between countries, for, as already \n     noted, restrictions would apply to imports of a violator, \n     irrespective of the country of origin. In practice, the \n     impact of the import restraints would fall most heavily on \n     the country where most of the violator's production \n     occurs. It is conceivable, however, unlikely, that a \n     pattern of selective use the import sanction could develop \n     over time sufficient to sustain a claim of unjustifiable \n     discrimination. The type of situation that could more \n     reasonably be expected to lead to a GATT challenge and \n     possible success would be a transparent use of the import \n     sanction to achieve protectionist objectives. \n     Circumstances suggesting such abuse would include the \n     targeting of sanctions toward particular products \n     accounting for troublesome import competition for domestic \n     producers and the imposition of import restraints of such \n     breadth or duration as to give them an economic impact \n     disproportionate to other penalties for violation of \n     export controls. (Note that denial of export privileges \n     can serve both as a penalty and as a protective device--a \n     blanket cut-off of a violator's access to U.S. goods and \n     technology reduces that person's ability to engage in \n     further diversions of strategic items).\n       Justification of import sanctions under Article XX would \n     also require a showing that the measures were ``necessary'' \n     to secure compliance--whereas Article XXI permits a \n     contracting party to take measures ``which it considers \n     necessary'' to protect its essential security interests. \n     Where Article XX is applied to enforcement measures relating \n     to security controls, however, it is reasonable to expect the \n     same GATT deference to a party's assessment of its security \n     needs and reluctance to render a decision on what would be \n     viewed as a ``political'' matter.\n\n\n                      nullification or impairment\n\n       The imposition of the import sanction against one of its \n     companies could cause a contracting party to invoke Article \n     XXIII claiming that the reduction of its exports to the U.S. \n     has ``nullified or impaired'' benefits accruing to it under \n     the GATT. It is not necessary to claim or establish that a \n     GATT obligation has been breached. Art. XXIII: ((b) and (c). \n     If the complaint is not satisfactorily adjusted between the \n     parties concerned, it may be referred to the GATT disputes \n     machinery and result in a panel proceeding and a GATT \n     Council recommendation or ruling. The contracting parties \n     could authorize the complaining country to suspend the \n     application of concessions or obligations under the GATT \n     to the country imposing the measures found to nullify or \n     impair benefits.\n       Given the extreme rarity of Article XXIII complaints \n     actually proceeding to authorized retaliation, it is hard to \n     believe that an import sanction case would ever lead to this \n     result. Specific factors weighing against a finding of \n     nullification or impairment are 1) the likelihood that other \n     producers in the country concerned would remain free to \n     supply the exports to the U.S. barred to the violator 2) the \n     likelihood that the economic impact of the sanction would be \n     insignificant in relation to the concerned country's overall \n     trade and 3) the likelihood that the contracting parties \n     would avoid acting with respect to security-related measures \n     even though they would not have to rule on their legality.\n\n\n                          other considerations\n\n       United States treaties such as our Friendship, Commerce and \n     Navigation treaties typically provide ``most favored nation'' \n     treatment for imports from the other country. In general, \n     import sanctions would seem even less vulnerable under such \n     treaties then under the GATT. First, an enforcement system \n     that treats similarly situated violators the same, without \n     regard to country of origin, arguably does not violate an MFN \n     obligation. Secondly, these treaties typically contain a \n     ``security'' or ``vital interests'' exception more broadly \n     worded than GATT Article XXI. However, a consideration that \n     could induce a country to invoke such a treaty rather than \n     GATT procedures would be concern over the difficulty of \n     getting such cases decided in GATT and the belief that the \n     World Court would be more willing to adjudicate.\n       The EAA import sanction amendment has been criticized as an \n     example of the allegedly improper extraterritorial extension \n     of U.S. export controls. Although the sanction is available \n     whether the violation involves conduct within United States \n     territory or abroad, it is undoubtedly recognized that the \n     sanction would most likely be applied to persons beyond the \n     reach of U.S. legal process. It is to be expected that the \n     violations charged would often involve activity abroad, such \n     as unauthorized reexports, which other governments claim is \n     beyond the regulatory jurisdiction of the United States. The \n     new sanction, of course, does not extend the jurisdictional \n     reach of the regulations. Like the existing authority to deny \n     export privileges, it simply supplies an enforcement tool \n     that can be effective against persons outside the United \n     States. In any possible challenge to the import sanction \n     under the GATT, these questions of legal jurisdiction \n     should be irrelevant. The Article XX exception is for \n     measures to secure compliance with laws or regulations \n     ``which are not inconsistent with the provisions of this \n     Agreement.'' The Agreement contains no provision affecting \n     rule-making jurisdiction, so claimed jurisdictional \n     excesses ought not to bear on GATT justification based on \n     Article XX. It should not be a surprise, nonetheless, if a \n     government that finds cause to complain in the GATT of a \n     U.S. export control action involving conduct abroad seeks \n     to inject the jurisdictional issue. That government may \n     well recognize that it has no real chance of having \n     positive action taken on its complaint yet it may hope to \n     get a GATT panel report to include some potentially useful \n     criticism of the jurisdictional reach of the controls.\n       Finally, it should be noted that the factors that would be \n     most important in sustaining the international legality of \n     the proposed import sanction would be, for the most part, \n     inapplicable to the other proposed EAA amendment that would \n     permit controls to be imposed against imports from a country \n     as to which export controls had been applied for foreign \n     policy purposes. The Article XXI exception would be \n     unavailable unless the controls could somehow be brought \n     within that Article's characterization of ``security \n     interests''. In contrast with sanctions against companies and \n     individuals, sanctions against countries would entail literal \n     conflict with the terms of pertinent GATT articles and MFN \n     provisions in treaties.\n       In conclusion, the reasonable use of the import sanction \n     against violators of security-related controls can be \n     justified under pertinent GATT and treaty provisions. A \n     government's good faith in imposing import controls is more \n     likely to be questioned, due to the protectionist potential \n     of such measures. Notwithstanding the traditional deference \n     in official proceedings to a country's security-related \n     justification of its measures, it will be important for our \n     government to avoid measures which debase the national \n     security standard and invite corresponding measures damaging \n     to our trading interests and to the integrity of the \n     international system of trade discipline.\n\n\n                               footnotes\n\n     \\1\\ 50 U.S.C. app. Sec. 2410(c) (Supp V, 1981).\n     \\2\\ Section 8(6) H.R. 2500, 98th Cong., 1st Sess., 129th \n     Cong.

Farnsworth)\n\n       Washington, Aug. 24.--A Federal judge today cleared the way \n     for the Commerce Department to penalize an American company \n     for refusing to comply with President Reagan's sanctions \n     against supplying equipment for the Siberian natural gas \n     pipeline.\n       The company, Dresser Industries, has declined to order its \n     French subsidiary to defy a French Government order to \n     deliver equipment to be used for the Soviet pipeline.\n       In another move against the company, two Administration \n     sources said, Cabinet members recommended during a meeting \n     held in unusual secrecy that Dresser and Dresser France, the \n     subsidiary, be placed on an American ``denial list.'' The \n     action would prevent the subsidiary from having any \n     commercial relations with the United States.\n       They said the blacklist was one of the options that \n     President Reagan was asked to consider in an options paper \n     that went to him tonight in California after the meeting, \n     which was under the chairmanship of Secretary of State George \n     P. Shultz.\n\n[[Page S 16519]]\n\n       Another meeting began at the Justice Department tonight to \n     prepare for enforcement of the denial order once the pipeline \n     equipment is actually loaded on a Russian freighter, the \n     Borodin, at Le Havre. The loading, which was to take place \n     today, has reportedly been delayed until Wednesday.\n       The sources stressed that it was still up to the President \n     to decide on a course of action in the developing \n     confrontation with France and other Western European \n     countries over the pipeline and the extraterritorial reach of \n     American laws.\n       United States District Judge Thomas O. Flannery, turning \n     down a last minute appeal by Dresser, refused to bar the \n     Administration from punishing the company.\n\n\n                      judge denies dresser request\n\n       The judge was asked by a lawyer representing Dresser, John \n     Vanderstar of the Washington law firm of Covington & Burling, \n     to issue a temporary restraining order that would prohibit \n     the Government from issuing penalties against Dresser. \n     However, the judge said that Mr. Vanderstar had failed to \n     show that the Dallas-based company would suffer ``immediate \n     and irreparable harm'' if the order was not issued.\n       Dresser France has agreed to supply three compressors, \n     worth $2 million, that it has already built. The Russians \n     have ordered a total of 21 compressors from Dresser, worth \n     $18 million to $20 million, to pump natural gas through the \n     3,600 mile pipeline. The company argued that if its \n     subsidiary did not ship the equipment, it would be liable to \n     criminal and civil penalties in France.\n       On the other hand, if it did ship the compressors, it would \n     violate the ban on supplying pipeline equipment to the \n     Russians imposed by President Reagan under an executive \n     decree last June 22. The American Export Administration Act \n     of 1979, under which that decree was issued, also calls for \n     civil and criminal penalties against violators.\n       That ruling extended American export controls not only to \n     the foreign activities of United States companies, but also \n     to foreign companies that use American technological licenses \n     to manufacture products of their own. The controls were \n     intended to deny American technology for the pipeline in \n     retaliation for Soviet-inspired repression in Poland.\n       ``The plaintiff is in a terrible jam,'' Mr. Vanderstar \n     said. ``Congress simply cannot have intended to authorize the \n     Secretary of Commerce, no matter how good his intentions, to \n     impose sanctions against this company.''\n       Richard Willard, Acting Assistant Attorney General in the \n     civil division of the Justice Department, told the judge that \n     injunctive relief would ``severely damage the foreign \n     relations of the United States.'' He emphasized that this was \n     an issue on which the President felt strongly.\n       He also said that the United States was not prepared to \n     concede that the French Government order to Dresser France to \n     ship the compressors represented even a ``valid exercise of \n     French law.''\n       On the other hand, the French and other Europeans, who have \n     filed a strong protest against the American sanctions, argue \n     that Europe cannot accept the right of the United States to \n     extend its jurisdiction to companies established outside its \n     territory.\n       Although it is the subsidiary of a Dallas-based company, \n     Dresser France is a French company and operates under French \n     laws.\n       Many other American subsidiaries in Europe and European \n     companies that produce pipeline equipment under American \n     license are affected by the June 22 order of the President. \n     The reason that Dresser became the target is that, according \n     to an Administration source, ``it just happened to have the \n     earliest delivery schedule.''\n       Commerce Secretary Malcolm Baldrige, who was cited as a \n     defendant in Dresser's petition for injunctive relief, said \n     he was ``pleased with the judge's ruling.'' But neither he, \n     nor Secretary of State Shultz, nor any other participant at \n     the Cabinet-level meeting would comment on the results of the \n     hearing.\n       The President has justified his action by citing both the \n     Polish repression and the financial and political advantages \n     the pipeline would bring to the Soviet Union. Europeans are \n     both financing and providing equipment for the line to \n     diversify energy sources and to provide employment for \n     depressed industries.\n       The President said that the Russians stand to earn $10 \n     billion to $12 billion a year from the gas and could use the \n     proceeds to become an even greater military threat.\n       The penalties that may be levied against Dresser are \n     discretionary, meaning that at one extreme the Government \n     need do nothing at all. At the other extreme, officials \n     explained, the United States could seek extradition of chief \n     executives of offending companies and seek to jail them in \n     the United States.\n       Although Secretary of State Shultz has supported the \n     sanctions, he had gone on record before joining the \n     Administration as opposing the use of trade as an instrument \n     of United States foreign policy.\n       He was quoted once, for instance, as saying that trade \n     cannot be ``turned on and off like a light switch,'' and \n     called for a ``predictable set of rules'' to avoid domestic \n     and foreign confusion.\n\n\n                        Compressors For Pipeline\n\n       Compressors are devices that increase the pressure of a \n     gas, vapor, or mixture of gas and vapor by reducing the \n     volume of such fluids as they pass through the device. In a \n     pipeline, they are used to increase the amount of fuel that \n     can be pumped through a line of a given diameter.\n       Dresser Industries manufactures a variety of compressors \n     used in transporting fuels, including centrifugal, \n     reciprocating, and axial compressors.\n       There are 21 50-ton centrifugal compressors involved in the \n     current dispute, according to Edward Luter, Dresser's senior \n     vice president. They cost about $700,000 each.\n       ``Each compressor order is to certain specifications,'' Mr. \n     Luter said yesterday in a telephone interview from Dresser's \n     Dallas headquarters.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n                     Guide to GATT Law and Practice\n\n\n                         i. text of article xxi\n\n                    Article XXI--Security Exceptions\n\n       Nothing in this Agreement shall be construed\n       (a) to require any contracting party to furnish any \n     information the disclosure of which it considers contrary to \n     its essential security interests; or\n       (b) to prevent any contracting party from taking any action \n     which it considers necessary for the protection of its \n     essential security interests\n       (i) relating to fissionable materials or the materials from \n     which they are derived;\n       (ii) relating to the traffic in arms, ammunition and \n     implements of war and to such traffic in other goods and \n     materials as is carried on directly or indirectly for the \n     purpose of supplying a military establishment;\n       (iii) taken in time of war or other emergency in \n     international relations; or\n       (c) to prevent any contracting party from taking any action \n     in pursuance of its obligations under the United Nations \n     Charter for the maintenance of international peace and \n     security.\n\n\n           ii. interpretation and application of article xxi\n\n                A. Scope and application of article XXI\n\n       1. Paragraphs (a) and (b): ``it considers . . . essential \n     security interests'':\n       During discussions in the Geneva session of the Preparatory \n     Committee, in response to an inquiry as to the meaning of \n     ``essential security interests'', it was stated by one of the \n     drafters of the original Draft Charter that ``We gave a good \n     deal of thought to the question of the security exception \n     which we thought should be included in the Charter. We \n     recognized that there was a great danger of having too wide \n     an exception and we could not put it into the Charter, simply \n     by saying: `by any Member of measures relating to a Member's \n     security interests,' because that would permit anything under \n     the sun. Therefore we thought it well to draft provisions \n     which would take care of real security interests and, at the \n     same time, so far as we could, to limit the exception so as \n     to prevent the adoption of protection for maintaining \n     industries under every conceivable circumstance. . . . There \n     must be some latitude here for security measures. It is \n     really a question of balance. We have got to have some \n     exceptions. We cannot make it too tight, because we cannot \n     prohibit measures which are needed purely for security \n     reasons. On the other hand, we cannot make it so broad that, \n     under the guise of security, countries will put on measures \n     which really have a commercial purpose''. The Chairman of \n     Commission A suggested in response that the spirit in which \n     Members of the Organization would interpret these provisions \n     was the only guarantee against abuses of this kind.\\1\\\n     Footnotes at end of article.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n       During the discussion of the complaint of Czechoslovakia at \n     the Third Session in 1949 (see page 556) it was stated, inter \n     alia, that ``every country must be the judge in the last \n     resort on questions relating to its own security. On the \n     other hand, every contracting party should be cautious not to \n     take any step which might have the effect of undermining the \n     General Agreement.\\2\\\n       In 1961, on the occasion of the accession of Portugal, \n     Ghana stated that its boycott of Portuguese goods was \n     justified under the provisions of Article XXI:(b)(iii), \n     noting that\n       ``. . . under this Article each contracting party was the \n     sole judge of what was necessary in its essential security \n     interest. There could therefore be no objection to Ghana \n     regarding the boycott of goods as justified by security \n     interests. It might be observed that a country's security \n     interests might be threatened by a potential as well as an \n     actual danger. The Ghanaian Government's view was that the \n     situation in Angola was a constant threat to the peace of the \n     African continent and that any action which, by bringing \n     pressure to bear on the Portuguese Government, might lead to \n     a lessening of this danger, was therefore justified in the \n     essential security interests of Ghana''.\\3\\\n       During the Council discussion in 1982 of trade restrictions \n     applied for non-economic reasons by the EEC, its member \n     States, Canada and Australia against imports from Argentina \n     (see page 557), the representative of the EEC stated that \n     ``the EEC and its member States had taken certain measures on \n     the basis of their inherent rights, of which Article XXI of \n     the General Agreement was a reflection. The exercise of these \n     rights constituted a general exception, and required neither \n     notification, justification nor approval, a procedure \n     confirmed by thirty-five years of implementation of the \n     General Agreement. He said that in effect, this procedure \n     showed that every contracting party \n\n[[Page S 16520]]\n\n     was--in the last resort--the judge of its exercise of these \n     rights''. The representative of Canada stated that ``Canada's \n     sovereign action was to be seen as a political response to a \n     political issue . . . Canada was convinced that the situation \n     which had necessitated the measures had to be satisfactorily \n     resolved by appropriate action elsewhere, as the GATT had \n     neither the competence nor the responsibility to deal with \n     the political issue which had been raised. His delegation \n     could not, therefore, accept the notion that there had been a \n     violation of the General Agreement''.\\4\\ The representative \n     of Australia ``stated that the Australian measures were in \n     conformity with the provisions of Article XXI:(c), which did \n     not require notification or justification''.\\5\\ The \n     representative of the United States stated that ``The General \n     Agreement left to each contracting party the judgment as to \n     what it considered to be necessary to protect its security \n     interests. The Contracting Parties had no power to question \n     that judgement''.\\6\\\n       The representative of Argentina noted that it had attempted \n     to submit to GATT only the trade aspects of this case and \n     stated ``that in order to justify restrictive measures a \n     contracting party invoking Article XXI would specifically be \n     required to state reasons of national security . . . there \n     were no trade restrictions which could be applied without \n     being notified, discussed and justified''.\\7\\\n       Paragraph 7(iii) of the Ministerial Declaration adopted 29 \n     November 1982 at the Thirty-eighth Session of the Contracting \n     Parties provides that ``. . .the contracting parties \n     undertake, individually and jointly: . . . to abstain from \n     taking restrictive trade measures, for reasons of a non-\n     economic character, not consistent with the General \n     Agreement''.\\8\\\n       The question of whether and to what extent the Contracting \n     Parties can review the national security reasons for measures \n     taken under Article XXI was discussed again in the GATT \n     Council in May and July 1985 in relation to the US trade \n     embargo against Nicaragua which had taken effect on 7 May \n     1985.\\9\\ While a panel was established to examine the US \n     measures, its terms of reference stated that ``the Panel \n     cannot examine or judge the validity or motivation for the \n     invocation of Article XXI(b)(iii) by the United States''.\\10\\ \n     In the Panel Report on ``United States--Trade Measures \n     affecting Nicaragua'', which has not been adopted,\n       ``. . . The Panel noted that, while both parties to the \n     dispute agreed that the United States, by imposing the \n     embargo, had acted contrary to certain trade-facilitating \n     provisions of the General Agreement, they disagreed on the \n     question of whether the non-observance of these provisions \n     was justified by Article XXI(b)(iii) . . .\n       ``The Panel further noted that, in the view of Nicaragua, \n     this provision should be interpreted in the light of the \n     basic principles of international law and in harmony with the \n     decisions of the United Nations and of the International \n     Court of Justice and should therefore be regarded as merely \n     providing contracting parties subjected to an aggression with \n     the right of self-defence. The Panel also noted that, in the \n     view of the United States, Article XXI applied to any action \n     which the contracting party taking it considered necessary \n     for the protection of its essential security interests and \n     that the Panel, both by the terms of Article XXI and by its \n     mandate, was precluded from examining the validity of the \n     United States' invocation of Article XXI.\n       ``The Panel did not consider the question of whether the \n     terms of Article XXI precluded it from examining the validity \n     of the United States' invocation of that Article as this \n     examination was precluded by its mandate. It recalled that \n     its terms of reference put strict limits on its activities \n     because they stipulated that the Panel could not examine or \n     judge the validity of or the motivation for the invocation of \n     Article XXI:(b)(iii) by the United States . . . The Panel \n     concluded that, as it was not authorized to examine the \n     justification for the United States' invocation of a general \n     exception to the obligations under the General Agreement, it \n     could find the United States neither to be complying with its \n     obligations under the General Agreement nor to be failing to \n     carry out its obligations under that Agreement''.\\11\\\n       2. Paragraph (a): ``disclose . . . any information'':\n       During the discussion at the Third Session of a \n     Czechoslovak complaint concerning United States national \n     security export controls, in response to a request by \n     Czechoslovakia for information under Article XIII:3 on the \n     export licensing system concerned, the US representative \n     stated that while it would comply with a substantial part of \n     the request, ``Article XXI . . . provides that a contracting \n     party shall not be required to give information which it \n     considers contrary to its essential security interests. The \n     United States does consider it contrary to its security \n     interest--and to the security interest of other friendly \n     countries--to reveal the names of the commodities that it \n     considers to be most strategic''.\\12\\\n       The ``Decision Concerning Article XXI of the General \n     Agreement'' of 30 November 1982 (see page 559 below) provides \n     inter alia that ``Subject to the exception in Article XXI:a, \n     contracting parties should be informed to the fullest extent \n     possible of trade measures taken under Article XXI''.\\13\\\n       3. Paragraph (b): ``action'':\n       (1) ``relating to fissionable materials or the materials \n     from which they are derived'':\n       The records of the Geneva discussions of the Preparatory \n     Committee indicate that the representative of Australia \n     withdrew its reservation on the inclusion of a reference to \n     ``fissionable materials'' in the light of a statement that \n     the provisions of Article 35 [XXIII] would apply to Article \n     XXI; see below at page 560.\\14\\\n       (2) ``relating to the traffic in arms, ammunition and \n     implements of war and to such traffic in other goods and \n     materials as is carried on directly or indirectly for the \n     purpose of supplying a military establishment'':\n       During discussions in the Geneva session of the Preparatory \n     Committee, in connection with a proposal to modify Article \n     37(g) [XX(g)] to permit export restrictions on raw materials \n     for long-term defense purposes, the question was put whether \n     the phrase ``for the purpose of supplying a military \n     establishment'' would permit restrictions on the export of \n     iron ore when it was believed that the ore would be used by \n     ordinary smelting works and ultimately for military purposes \n     by another country. It was stated in response that ``if a \n     Member exporting commodities is satisfied that the purpose of \n     the transaction was to supply a military establishment, \n     immediately or ultimately, this language would cover it''. \n     \\15\\\n       At the Third Session in 1949, Czechoslovakia requested a \n     decision under Article XXIII as to whether the US had failed \n     to carry out its obligations under Articles I and XIII, by \n     reason of the 1948 US administration of its export licensing \n     controls (both short-supply controls and new export controls \n     instituted in 1948 discriminating between destination \n     countries for security reasons). The US stated that its \n     controls for security reasons applied to a narrow group of \n     exports of goods which could be used for military purposes \n     \\16\\ and also stated that ``the provisions of Article I would \n     not require uniformity of formalities, as applied to \n     different countries, in respect of restrictions imposed for \n     security reasons''. \\17\\ It was also stated by one \n     contracting party that ``goods which were of a nature that \n     could contribute to war potential'' came within the exception \n     of Article XXI.\\18\\ The complaint was rejected by a roll-call \n     vote of 17 to 1 with 3 abstentions.\\19\\\n       (3) ``taken in time of war or other emergency in \n     international relations'':\n       The 1970 Working Party Report on ``Accession of the United \n     Arab Republic'' notes that in response to concerns raised \n     regarding the Arab League boycott against Israel and the \n     secondary boycott against firms having relations with Israel, \n     the representative of the UAR stated that ``the history of \n     the Arab boycott was beyond doubt related to the \n     extraordinary circumstances to which the Middle East area had \n     been exposed. The state of war which had long prevailed in \n     that area necessitated the resorting to this system. . . . In \n     view of the political character of this issue, the United \n     Arab Republic did not wish to discuss it within GATT. . . . \n     It would not be reasonable to ask that the United Arab \n     Republic should do business with a firm that transferred all \n     or part of its profits from sales to the United Arab Republic \n     to an enemy country''. \\20\\ Several members of the working \n     party supported the views of the representative of the UAR \n     that the background of the boycott measures was political and \n     not commercial.\\21\\\n       In November 1975 Sweden introduced a global import quota \n     system for certain footwear. The Swedish Government \n     considered that the measure was taken in conformity with the \n     spirit of Article XXI and stated, inter alia, that the \n     ``decrease in domestic production has become a critical \n     threat to the emergency planning of Sweden's economic defence \n     as an integral part of the country's security policy. This \n     policy necessitates the maintenance of a minimum domestic \n     production capacity in vital industries. Such a capacity is \n     indispensable in order to secure the provision of essential \n     products necessary to meet basic needs in case of war or \n     other emergency in international relations''.\\22\\ In the \n     discussion of this measure in the GATT Council, ``Many \n     representatives . . . expressed doubts as to the \n     justification of these measures under the General Agreement . \n     . . Many delegations reserved their rights under the GATT and \n     took note of Sweden's offer to consult''.\\23\\ Sweden notified \n     the termination of the quotas as far as leather and plastic \n     shoes were concerned as of 1 July 1977.\\24\\\n       In April 1982, the EEC and its member states, Canada, and \n     Australia suspended indefinitely imports into their \n     territories of products of Argentina. In notifying these \n     measures they stated that ``they have taken certain measures \n     in the light of the situation addressed in the Security \n     Council Resolution 502 [the Falkland/Malvinas issue]; they \n     have taken these measures on the basis of their inherent \n     rights of which Article XXI of the General Agreement is a \n     reflection''.\\25\\ Argentina took the position that, in \n     addition to infringing the principles and objectives \n     underlying the GATT, these measures were in violation of \n     Articles I;1, II, XI:1, XIII, and Part IV. The legal aspects \n     of these trade restrictions affecting Argentina were \n     discussed extensively in the Council.\\26\\ The measures were \n     removed in June 1982. Argentina sought an interpretation of \n     Article XXI; these efforts led to the inclusion of paragraph \n     7(iii) in the Ministerial Declaration of November 1982, which \n     provides that ``. . .  the contracting parties undertake, \n     individually and \n\n[[Page S 16521]]\n\n     jointly: . . . to abstain from taking restrictive trade \n     measures, for reasons of a non-economic charter, not \n     consistent with the General Agreement'' \\27\\ and also led to \n     the adoption of the text below at page 559.\n       On 7 May 1985 the US notified the contracting parties of an \n     Executive Order prohibiting all imports of goods and services \n     of Nicaraguan origin, all exports from the US of goods to or \n     destined for Nicaragua (except those destined for the \n     organized democratic resistance) and transactions relating \n     thereto. \\28\\ In Council discussions of this matter, \n     Nicaragua stated that these measures contravened Article I, \n     II, V, XI, XIII and Part IV of the GATT, and that ``this was \n     not a matter of national security but one of coercion''.\\29\\ \n     Nicaragua further stated that Article XXI could not be \n     applied in an arbitrary fashion; there had to be some \n     correspondence between the measures adopted and the situation \n     giving rise to such adoption.\\30\\ Nicaragua stated that the \n     text of Article XXI made it clear that the Contracting \n     Parties were competent to judge whether a situation of ``war \n     or other emergency in international relations'' existed and \n     requested that a Panel be set up under Article XXIII:2 to \n     examine the issue.\\31\\ The United States stated that its \n     actions had been taken for national security reasons and were \n     covered by Article XXI:(b)(iii) of the GATT; and that this \n     provision left it to each contracting party to judge what \n     action it considered necessary for the protection of its \n     essential security interest.\\32\\ The terms of reference of \n     the Panel precluded it from examining or judging the validity \n     of the invocation of Article XXI(b)(ii) by the U.S. \n     Concerning the Panel decision on this issue, see page 555 and \n     the discussion of Article XXIII below. When the Council \n     discussed the Panel Report, Nicaragua requested that the \n     Council recommend removal of the embargo; authorized special \n     support measures for Nicaragua so that countries wanting to \n     do so could grant trade preferences aimed at re-establishing \n     a balance in Nicaragua's pre-embargo global trade relations \n     and at compensating Nicaragua for the damage caused by the \n     embargo; and prepare an interpretative note on Article XXI. \n     Consensus was not reached on any of these alternatives. The \n     Panel Report has not been adopted. At the meeting of the \n     Council on 3 April 1990 Nicaragua announced the lifting of \n     the trade embargo. The representative of the US announced \n     that the conditions which had necessitated action under \n     Article XXI had ceased to exist, his country's national \n     security emergency with respect to Nicaragua had been \n     terminated, and all economic sanctions, including the trade \n     embargo, had been lifted.\\33\\\n       In November 1991, the European Community notified the \n     contracting parties that the EC and its member States had \n     decided to adopt trade measures against Yugoslavia ``on the \n     grounds that the situation prevailing in Yugoslavia no longer \n     permits the preferential treatment of this country to be \n     upheld. Therefore, as from 11 November, imports from \n     Yugoslavia into the Community are applied m.f.n. treatment . \n     . . These measures are taken by the European Community upon \n     consideration of its essential security interests and based \n     on GATT Article XXI.''\\34\\ The measures comprised suspension \n     of trade concessions granted to the Socialist Federal \n     Republic of Yugoslavia under its bilateral trade agreement \n     with the EC; application of certain limitations (previously \n     suspended) to textile imports from Yugoslavia; withdrawal of \n     GSP benefits; suspension of similar concessions and GSP \n     benefits for ECSC products; and action to denounce or suspend \n     the application of the bilateral trade agreements between the \n     EC and its member states and Yugoslavia. On 2 December the \n     Community and its member states decided to apply selective \n     measures in favor of ``those parties which contribute to \n     progress toward peace.'' Economic sanctions or withdrawal of \n     preferential benefits from the Yugoslavia were also taken by \n     Australia, Austria, Canada, Finland, Japan, New Zealand, \n     Norway, Sweden, Switzerland, and the United States.\n       At the Forty-seventh Session in December 1991, Yugoslavia \n     referred to the Decision of 1982 on notification of measures \n     taken under Article XXI (see page 559 below) and reserved its \n     GATT rights. In February 1992 Yugoslavia requested \n     establishment of a panel under Article XXIII:2, stating that \n     the measures taken by the EC were inconsistent with Articles \n     I, XXI and the Enabling Clause; departed from the letter and \n     intention of paragraph 7(iii) of the Ministerial Decision of \n     November 1982; and impeded the attainment of the objectives \n     of the General Agreement. Yugoslavia further stated:\n       ``The situation in Yugoslavia is a specific one and does \n     not correspond to the notion and meaning of Article XXI (b) \n     and (c). There is no decision or resolution of the relevant \n     UN body to impose economic sanctions against Yugoslavia based \n     on the reasoning embodied in the UN Charger. . . . the \n     `positive compensatory measures' applied by the European \n     Community to certain parts of Yugoslavia [are] contrary to \n     the MFN treatment of `products originating in or destined for \n     the territories'--taken as a whole--`of all contracting \n     parties' ''.\\35\\\n       In March 1992, the Council agreed to establish a panel with \n     the standard terms of reference unless, as provided in the \n     Decision of 12 April 1989, the parties agreed otherwise \n     within twenty days.\\36\\ At the April 1992 Council meeting, in \n     discussion of the notification of the transformation of the \n     Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (SFRY) into the \n     Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (FRY) consisting of the \n     Republics of Serbia and Montenegro, the EC representative \n     said that until the question of succession to Yugoslavia's \n     contracting party status had been resolved, the Panel process \n     which had been initiated between the former SFRY and the EC \n     no longer had any foundation and could not proceed.\\37\\ At \n     the May 1992 Council meeting, in a discussion concerning the \n     status of the FRY as a successor to the former SFRY as a \n     contracting party, the Chairman stated that ``In these \n     circumstances, without prejudice to the question of who \n     should succeed the former SFRY in the GATT, and until the \n     Council returned to this issue, he proposed that the \n     representative of the FRY should refrain from participating \n     in the business of the Council''. The Council so agreed.\\38\\ \n     At the June 1993 Council meeting this decision was modified \n     taking into account United Nations General Assembly \n     Resolution 47/1 to provide that the FRY could not continue \n     automatically the contracting party status of the former SFRY \n     and that it shall not participate in the work of the Council \n     and its subsidiary bodies.\\39\\\n       4. Other invocations of Article XXI:\n       The United States embargo on trade with Cuba, which was \n     imposed by means of Proclamation 3447 by the President of the \n     United States, dated 3 February 1962, was not formally raised \n     in the Contracting Parties but notified by Cuba in the \n     inventory of non-tariff measures. The United States invoked \n     Article XXI as justification for its action.\\40\\\n       5. Procedures concerning notification of measures under \n     Article XXI:\n       During the Council discussion in 1982 of trade measures for \n     non-economic reasons taken against Argentina (see page 557), \n     it was stated by the countries taking these measures that \n     ``Article XXI did not mention notification'' and that many \n     contracting parties had, in the past, invoked Article XXI \n     without there having been any notification or challenge to \n     the situation in GATT.\\41\\ Argentina sought an interpretation \n     of Article XXI. Informal consultations took place during the \n     Thirty-eighth Session in November 1982 in connection with the \n     adoption of the Council report to the Contracting Parties, in \n     so far as it related to these trade restrictions.\\42\\ As a \n     result, on 30 November 1982 the Contracting Parties adopted \n     the following ``Decision Concerning Article XXI of the \n     General Agreement'':\n       ``Considering that the exceptions envisaged in Article XXI \n     of the General Agreement constitute an important element for \n     safeguarding the rights of contracting parties when they \n     consider that reasons of security are involved;\n       ``Noting that recourse to Article XXI could constitute, in \n     certain circumstances, an element of disruption and \n     uncertainty for international trade and affect benefits \n     accruing to contracting parties under the General Agreement;\n       ``Recognizing that in taking action in terms of the \n     exceptions provided in Article XXI of the General Agreement, \n     contracting parties should take into consideration the \n     interests of third parties which may be affected;\n       ``That until such time as the Contracting Parties may \n     decide to make a formal interpretation of Article XXI it is \n     appropriate to set procedural guidelines for its application;\n       The Contracting Parties decide that:\n       ``1. Subject to the exception in Article XXI:a, contracting \n     parties should be informed to the fullest extent possible of \n     trade measures taken under Article XXI.\n       ``2. When action is taken under Article XXI, all \n     contracting parties affected by such action retain their full \n     rights under the General Agreement.\n       ``3. The Council may be requested to give further \n     consideration to this matter in due course''.\\43\\\n       See the references to this Decision above in the case of EC \n     measures on trade with Yugoslavia.\n\n B. Relationship between article XXI and other articles of the General \n                               Agreement\n\n       1. Articles I and XIII:\n       During the discussion at the Third Session of the complaint \n     of Czechoslovakia that U.S. export controls were administered \n     inconsistently with Articles I and XIII (see page 556), the \n     US representative stated that these restrictions were \n     justified under Article XXI(b)(ii). In calling for a \n     decision, the Chairman indicated that Article XXI ``embodied \n     exceptions to the general rule contained in Article I''. In a \n     Decision of 8 June 1949 under Article XXIII:2, the \n     Contracting Parties rejected the contention of the \n     Czechoslovak delegation.\\44\\\n       2. Article XXIII:\n       During discussions in Geneva in 1947 in connection with the \n     removal of the provisions now contained in Article XXI and \n     their relocation in a separate exception (Article 94) at the \n     end of the Charter, the question was raised whether the \n     dispute settlement provisions of Article 35 of the New York \n     Draft [XXII/XXIII] would nevertheless apply. It was stated \n     that ``It is true that an action taken by a Member under \n     Article 94 could not be challenged in the sense that it could \n     not be claimed that a Member was violating the Charter; but \n     if that action, even though not in conflict with the terms of \n     Article 94, should affect another Member, I should think that \n     that Member would have the right to seek redress of some kind \n     under Article 37 as it now stands. In other words, there is \n     no exception from the application of Article 35 to this or \n     any other Article''.\\45\\ The \n\n[[Page S 16522]]\n\n     addition of a note to clarify that the provisions of \n     paragraph 2 of Article 35 [XXIII] applied to Article 94 was \n     rejected as unnecessary.\\46\\\n       See the discussion above of the Czechoslovak complaint \n     concerning export controls, in which the Contracting Parties \n     make a decision under Article XXIII:2 as to ``whether the \n     Government of the United States had failed to carry out its \n     obligations under the Agreement through its administration of \n     the issue of export licences''.\\47\\\n       During the discussion of the trade restrictions affecting \n     Argentina applied for non-economic reasons, the view was \n     expressed ``that the provisions of Article XXI were subject \n     to those of Article XXIII:2''. Argentina reserved its rights \n     under Article XXIII in respect of any injury resulting from \n     trade restrictions applied in the context of Article XXI.\\48\\\n       Paragraph 2 of the ``Decision Concerning Article XXI of the \n     General Agreement'' of 30 November 1982 stipulates that ``. . \n     . when action is taken under Article XXI, all contracting \n     parties affected by such action retain their full rights \n     under the General Agreement''.\\49\\\n       The 1984 Panel Report on ``United States--Imports of Sugar \n     from Nicaragua'' examined the action taken by the US \n     government to reduce the share of the US sugar import quota \n     allocated to Nicaragua and distribute the reduction in \n     Nicaragua's allocation to El Salvador, Honduras and Costa \n     Rica. The Panel Report notes that ``The United States stated \n     that it was neither invoking any exceptions under the \n     provisions of the General Agreement nor intending to defend \n     its actions in GATT terms . . . the action of the United \n     States did of course affect trade, but was not taken for \n     trade policy reasons.'' \\50\\\n       ``The Panel noted that the measures taken by the United \n     States concerning sugar imports from Nicaragua were but one \n     aspect of a more general problem. The Panel, in accordance \n     with its terms of reference . . . examined those measures \n     solely in the light of the relevant GATT provisions, \n     concerning itself only with the trade issue under dispute.'' \n     \\51\\\n       ``. . . The Panel . . . concluded that the sugar quota \n     allocated to Nicaragua for the fiscal year 1983/84 was \n     inconsistent with the United States' obligations under \n     Article XIII:2.\n       ``The Panel noted that the United States had not invoked \n     any of the exceptions provided for in the General Agreement \n     permitting discriminatory quantitative restrictions contrary \n     to Article XXIII. The Panel did not examine whether the \n     reduction in Nicaragua's quota could be justified under any \n     such provision.'' \\52\\\n       The follow-up on the Panel report was discussed in the \n     Council meetings of May and July 1984. The United States said \n     that it ``had not obstructed Nicaragua's resort to GATT's \n     dispute settlement process; it had stated explicitly the \n     conditions under which the issue might be resolved; and it \n     recognized that Nicaragua had certain rights under Article \n     XXIII which it had reserved and could continue to \n     exercise''.\\53\\ Nicaragua stated that it was aware of its \n     rights under Article XXIII.\n       In July 1985, following a request by Nicaragua for the \n     establishment of a panel to review certain US trade measures \n     affecting Nicaragua, the right of a contracting party to \n     invoke Article XXIII in cases involving Article XXI was \n     discussed again in the GATT Council.\\54\\ At its meetings in \n     October 1985 and March 1986 respectively the Council \n     established a panel with the following terms of reference to \n     deal with the complaint by Nicaragua:\n       ``To examine, in the light of the relevant GATT provisions, \n     of the understanding reached at the Council on 10 October \n     1985 that the Panel cannot examine or judge the validity of \n     or motivation for the invocation of Article XXI(b)(iii) by \n     the United States, of the relevant provisions of the \n     Understanding Regarding Notification, Consultation, Dispute \n     Settlement and Surveillance (BISD 26S/211-218), and of the \n     agreed Dispute Settlement Procedures contained in the 1982 \n     Ministerial Declaration (BISD 29S/13-16), the measures taken \n     by the United States on 7 May 1985 and their trade effects in \n     order to establish to what extent benefits accruing to \n     Nicaragua under the General Agreement have been nullified or \n     impaired, and to make such findings as will assist the \n     Contracting Parties in further action in this matter''.\\55\\\n       In the Panel Report on ``United States--Trade Measures \n     affecting Nicaragua'', which has not been adopted, the Panel \n     noted the different views of the parties regarding whether \n     the United States' invocation of Article XXI(b)(iii) was \n     proper, and concluded that this issue was not within its \n     terms of reference; see above at page 555. With regard to \n     Nicaragua's claim of non-violation nullification or \n     impairment, the Panel ``decided not to propose a ruling in \n     this case on the basic question of whether actions under \n     Article XXI could nullify or impair GATT benefits of the \n     adversely affected contracting party''.\\56\\\n       When the Panel's report was discussed by the Council in \n     November 1986, the US representative stated that \n     ``Nullification or impairment when no GATT violation had been \n     found was a delicate issue, linked to the concept of \n     `reasonable expectations'. It was not simply a question of \n     trade damage, since no one doubted the existence of trade \n     damage. Applying the concept of `reasonable expectations' to \n     a case of trade sanctions motivated by national security \n     considerations would be particularly perilous, since at a \n     broader level those security considerations would \n     nevertheless enter into expectations . . . the Panel had \n     acted wisely in refraining from a decision that could create \n     a precedent of much wider ramifications for the scope of GATT \n     rights and obligations . . .''.\\57\\ The representative of \n     Nicaragua stated that her delegation could not support \n     adoption of the report, inter alia because it could only be \n     adopted once the Council was in a position to make \n     recommendations.\\58\\\n\n   C. Relationship between article XXI and general international law\n\n       The 1986 Panel Report on ``United States--Trade Measures \n     Affecting Nicaragua'', which has not been adopted, noted the \n     different views of the parties to the dispute concerning the \n     relationship between Article XXI and general international \n     law including decisions of the United Nations and the \n     International Court of Justice.\\59\\\n       In discussion at the Forty-seventh Session in December 1991 \n     concerning trade measures for non-economic purposes against \n     Yugoslavia, the representative of India stated that ``India \n     did not favour the use of trade measures for non-economic \n     reasons. Such measures should only be taken within the \n     framework of a decision by the United Nations Security \n     Council. In the absence of such a decision or resolution, \n     there was serious risk that such measures might be unilateral \n     or arbitrary and would undermine the multilateral trading \n     system''. \\60\\\n\n\n                         III. PREPARATORY WORK\n\n       In the US Draft Charter, and London and New York Draft \n     Charter texts, the Article on exceptions to the commercial \n     policy chapter included the provisions of what is now GATT \n     Article XXI (see Article 32, US draft; Article 37, London and \n     New York drafts). Also in these drafts, the exceptions clause \n     for the chapter on commodity agreements included provisions \n     excepting arrangements relating to fissionable materials; to \n     the traffic in arms, ammunition and implements of war and \n     traffic in goods and materials for the purpose of supply a \n     military establishment; or in time of war or other emergency \n     in international relations, to the protection of the \n     essential security interests of a member (Article 49:2, US \n     Draft; Article 59(2), London Draft; article 59(c), New York \n     Draft). At Geneva it was decided to take paragraphs (c), (d), \n     (e) and (k) of Article 37 and place them in a separate \n     Article. \\61\\ It was agreed that this Article would be a \n     general exception applicable to the entire Charter. \\62\\ The \n     corresponding security exception was also removed from the \n     commodity chapter. The security exception provisions became \n     Article 94 in Chapter VII of the Geneva draft Charter, which \n     was virtually identical to the present text of Article XXI.\n       The text of Article 94 was extensively discussed at Havana \n     in the Sixth Committee on Organization. Article 94 became \n     Article 99 of the Charter on General Exceptions, of which \n     paragraphs 1(a) and (b) were almost identical to those of \n     Article XXI, the only differences being (i) an addition in \n     the first line of paragraph (b) as follows: ``to prevent any \n     Member from taking, either singly or with other States, any \n     action . . .'', and (ii) an addition to paragraph (b)(ii) as \n     follows: ``a military establishment of any other country''. \n     Article 99 also included a paragraph 1(c) exempting \n     intergovernmental military supply agreements \\63\\; a \n     paragraph 1(d) on trade relations between India and Pakistan \n     (dealt with in the General Agreement by the provisions of \n     Article XXIV:11); and a paragraph 2 providing that nothing in \n     the Charter would override the provisions of peace treaties \n     resulting from the Second World War or UN instruments \n     creating trust territories or other special regimes.\n       However, ``on examining several of the proposals submitted \n     by delegations relating to action taken in connection with \n     political matters or with the essential interests of Members, \n     the Committee concluded that the provisions regarding such \n     action should be made in connection with an article on \n     `Relations with the United Nations', since the question of \n     the proper allocation of responsibility as between the \n     Organization and the United Nations was involved'', \\64\\ \n     Accordingly a new Article 86 of the Charter on ``Relations \n     with the United Nations'' was drafted, including the former \n     paragraph 1(c) of Article 94 [XXI:(c)].\n       Article 86 of the Charter dealt with various institutional \n     questions such as the conclusion of a specialized agency \n     agreement between the ITO and the UN. It also stated, in \n     paragraph 3, that:\n       ``3. The Members recognize that the Organization should not \n     attempt to take action which would involve passing judgment \n     in any way on essentially political matters. Accordingly, and \n     in order to avoid conflict of responsibility between the \n     United Nations and the Organization with respect to such \n     matters, any measure taken by a Member directly in connection \n     with a political matter brought before the United Nations in \n     accordance with the provisions of Chapters IV or VI of the \n     United Nations Charter shall be deemed to fall within the \n     scope of the United Nations, and shall not be subject to the \n     provisions of this Charter.\n       ``4. No action, taken by a Member in pursuance of its \n     obligations under the United Nations Charter for the \n     maintenance or restoration of international peace and \n     security, shall be deemed to conflict with the provisions of \n     this Charter''.\n       The interpretative notes to paragraph 3 provided that:\n\n[[Page S 16523]]\n\n       ``1. If any Member raises the question whether a measure is \n     in fact taken directly in connection with a political matter \n     brought before the United Nations in accordance with the \n     provisions of Chapters IV or VI of the United Nations \n     Charter, the responsibility for making a determination on the \n     question shall rest with the Organization. If, however, \n     political issues beyond the competence of the Organization \n     are involved in making such a determination, the question \n     shall be deemed to fall within the scope of the United \n     Nations.\n       ``2. If a Member which has no direct political concern in a \n     matter brought before the United Nations considers that a \n     measure taken directly in connection therewith and falling \n     within the scope of paragraph 3 of Article 86 constitutes a \n     nullification or impairment within the terms of paragraph 1 \n     of Article 93, it shall seek redress only by recource to the \n     procedures set forth in Chapter VIII of this Charter''.\n       The purpose of these provisions was explained by the Sixth \n     Committee as follows:\n       ``Paragraph 3 of Article [86], which like paragraph 4 is \n     independent in its operation, is designed to deal with any \n     measure which is directly in connection with a political \n     matter brought before the United Nations in a manner which \n     will avoid conflict of responsibility between the United \n     Nations and the Organization with respect to political \n     matters. The Committee agreed that this provision would cover \n     measures maintained by a Member even though another Member \n     had brought the particular matter before the United Nations, \n     so long as the measure was taken directly in connection with \n     the matter. It was also agreed that such a measure, as well \n     as the political matter with which it was directly connected, \n     should remain within the jurisdiction of the United Nations \n     and not within that of the Organization. The Committee was of \n     the opinion that the important thing was to maintain the \n     jurisdiction of the United Nations over political matters and \n     over economic measures of this sort taken directly in \n     connection with such a political matter, and nothing in \n     Article [86] could be held to prejudice the freedom of action \n     of the United Nations to settle such matters and to take \n     steps to deal with such economic measures in accordance with \n     the provisions of the Charter of the United Nations if they \n     see fit to do so.\n       ``It was the view of the Committee that the word `measure' \n     in paragraph 3 of Article [86] refers only to a measure which \n     is taken directly in connection with a political matter \n     brought before the United Nations in accordance with Chapters \n     IV and VI of the Charter of the United Nations and does not \n     refer to any other measure''.\\65\\\n       The Charter provisions in Articles 86 and 99 were not not \n     taken into the General Agreement. While Article XXIX:1 \n     provides that ``The contracting parties undertake to observe \n     . . . the general principles of Chapters I to VI and of \n     Chapter IX of the Havana Charter'', the Note Ad Article \n     XXIX:1 provides that ``Chapters VII and VIII . . . have been \n     excluded from paragraph 1 because they generally deal with \n     the organization, functions and procedures of the \n     International Trade Organization''. In this connection, \n     during the discussion at the Sixth Session of the Contracting \n     Parties of the US suspension of trade relations with \n     Czechoslovakia it was stated with reference to Article 86, \n     paragraph 3 of the Havana Charter that ``although Chapter VII \n     of the Charter was not specifically included by reference in \n     Article XXIX of the Agreement, it had surely been the general \n     intention that the principles of the Charter should be \n     guiding ones for the Contracting Parties''.\\66\\\n       The present text of Article XXI dates from the 30 October \n     1948 Geneva Final Act. It has never been amended. Amendment \n     of Article XXI was neither proposed nor discussed in the \n     1954-55 Review Session.\n\n\n                         iv. relevant documents\n\n       Geneva:\n       Discussion: EPCT/WP.1/SR/11, EPCT/A/SR/25, 30, 33, 40(2), \n     EPCT/A/PV/25, 30, 33, 40(2).\n       Reports: EPCT/103.\n       Other: EPCT/W/23.\n       Havana:\n       Discussion: E/CONF.2/C.5/SR.14, E/CONF.2/C.6/SR.18, 19, 37, \n     and Add. 1.\n       Reports: E/CONF.2/C.5/14, E/CONF.2/C.6/45, 93, 104.\n       Other: E/CONF.2/C.6/12/Add.9, E/CONF.2/C.6/W/48.\n       See also London, New York and Geneva document references \n     concerning Article XX.\n\n\n                               FOOTNOTES\n\n     \\1\\ EPCT/A/PV/33, p. 20-21 and Corr. 1; see also EPCT/A/SR/\n     33, p. 3.\n     \\2\\ GATT/CP.3/SR.22, Corr. 1.\n     \\3\\ SR.19/12, p. 196.\n     \\4\\ C/M/157, p. 10.\n     \\5\\ C/M/157, p. 11.\n     \\6\\ C/M/159, p. 19; see also C/M/157, p. 8.\n     \\7\\ C/M/157, p. 12; C/M/159, pp. 14-15.\n     \\8\\ L/5424, adopted on 29 November 1982, 29S/9, 11.\n     \\9\\ C/M/188, pp. 2-16; C/M/191, pp. 41-46.\n     \\10\\ C/M/196 at p. 7.\n     \\11\\ L/6053, dated 13 October 1953 (unadopted), paras. 5.1-\n     5.3.\n     \\12\\ GATT/CP.3/38, p. 9.\n     \\13\\ L/5426, 29S/23-24, para. 1.\n     \\14\\ EPCT/A/PV/33, p. 29; see also EPCT/A/PV/33/Corr. 3.\n     \\15\\ EPCT/A/PV/36, p. 19; see also proposal referred to at \n     EPCT/W/264.\n     \\16\\ GATT/CP.3/38; GATT/CP.3/SR.22, p. 8.\n     \\17\\ GATT/CP.3/SR.22, p. 4-5.\n     \\18\\ GATT/CP.3/SR.20, p. 3-4.\n     \\19\\ GATT/CP.3/SR.22, p. 9; Decision of 8 June 1949 at II/28.\n     \\20\\ L/3362, adopted on 27 February 1970, 17S/33, 39, para. \n     22.\n     \\21\\ Ibid., 17S/40, para. 23.\n     \\22\\ L/4250, p. 3.\n     \\23\\ C/M/109, p. 8-9.\n     \\24\\ L/4250/Add.1; L/4254, p. 17-18.\n     \\25\\ L/5319/Rev. 1.\n     \\26\\ L/5317, L/5336; C/M/157, C/M/159.\n     \\27\\ L/5424. adopted on 29 November 1982, 29S/9, 11.\n     \\28\\ L/5803.\n     \\29\\ C/M/188l p. 4.\n     \\30\\ C/M/188, p. 16.\n     \\31\\ L/5802; C/M/191, pp. 41-46.\n     \\32\\ C/M/191, pp. 41,46.\n     \\33\\ C/M/240, p. 31; L/6661.\n     \\34\\ L/6948.\n     \\35\\ DS27/2, dated 10 February 1992.\n     \\36\\ C/M/255, p. 18.\n     \\37\\ C/M/256, p. 32.\n     \\38\\ C/M/257 p. 3 and Corr. 1.\n     \\39\\ C/M/264, p. 3.\n     \\40\\ COM.IND/6/Add.4, p. 53 (notification); MTN/3B/4, p. 559 \n     (response citing binding reolution under Inter-American \n     Treaty of Reciprocal Assistance).

Mr. President, today, two of our colleagues on the other \nside of the aisle, Senators Dodd and Kerrey, held a press conference \nendorsing legislation that Senator Feingold and I and Senator Thompson \nand others introduced some time ago. This follows on the heels of an \nannouncement in the other body by Congresswoman Smith and Congressman \nMarkey of Massachusetts and Congressman Shays of support for this \nlegislation as well, including announcement by the Speaker of the House \nthat hearings would begin on the issue of campaign finance reform.\n  Mr. President, I welcome all of these initiatives and support. I \nbelieve that the issue of campaign finance reform is one that is very \nimportant to the American people and becomes more important almost on a \ndaily basis.\n  I wish to emphasize, after having been through this issue for a \nnumber of years, that if the issue is not bipartisan, then there will \nbe no resolution to the campaign finance reform issue. And I worry \nsometimes that this legislation may tilt to one side or the other. That \nis why the Senator from Wisconsin and I have tried to maintain a \nbalance as far as cosponsors are concerned.\n  If there is one lesson about reform in this body, and reform in the \nway we do business not only inside the Congress but in the way we \nconduct our campaigns, it is that any reform must be done on a \nbipartisan basis. I urge my colleagues who have similar ideas--I \nunderstand there are at least about 40 or 50 other campaign reform \nproposals now floating around--they engage it on a bipartisan basis, in \nwhich I and my friend from Wisconsin would be glad to join them.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/11/01/senate-section/article/S16554-1", "month": "11", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "01", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S16554]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  MEASURE PLACED ON CALENDAR--S. 1372\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I would like to strongly associate \nmyself with the remarks of the Senator from Arizona with regard to the \nrecent news on our efforts on campaign finance reform.\n  Last week, we were extremely pleased to see a bipartisan group in the \nHouse essentially agree to introduce the kind of legislation that the \nSenator from Arizona and I have proposed.\n  Today, we are also pleased by the announcement of the support by the \nchairman of the Democratic National Committee and the chairman of the \nDemocratic Senatorial Campaign Committee.\n  We are not so excited about the fact that these people happen to be \nleaders in the Democratic Party--that is good--but the more important \nthing is that it is another sign of the importance and the value of the \nbipartisan nature of this proposal.\n  The House proposal last week was bipartisan. Adding these two \nSenators to this group makes it another significant step in bringing \nboth parties together with regard to this issue. I have been very \npleased with the quick response from various Senators on signing on to \nthis bill. Week by week, we have added new people.\n  I also want to note the editorial endorsements that the Senator from \nArizona alluded to. The Feingold-McCain-Thompson bill has been endorsed \nby the New York Times, the Washington Post, Los Angeles Times, Dallas \nMorning News, Milwaukee Journal, St. Louis Post-Dispatch, Kansas City \nStar, Houston Chronicle, Nashville Tennessean, the Boston Globe, and \nmany others. Of course, this was added to last week in addition by the \nendorsement of Ross Perot, who has indicated a lot of support on this \nissue.\n  Today, the addition of the support of Senator Bob Kerrey of Nebraska \nand Senator Dodd of Connecticut helps us move in that direction.\n  It takes about 100 steps to pass this bill. It is a complicated, very \ncontroversial bill that has been a knotty problem for the Congress for \nmany years, but I think we have taken about 25 or 35 of those steps \nalready. These endorsements are very important today.\n  Senator Dodd's response at the news conference to the question of, \n``Why do you think this bill has a chance of actually passing?'' was \nright on target. The fact that this bill has Republican and Democrat \ncosponsors and represents the first truly bipartisan bill, the first \ntruly bipartisan bill in nearly 10 years, automatically makes this \neffort different, dramatically different than past efforts.\n  Senator Bob Kerrey of Nebraska also made an excellent point about \nnobody understanding the need for reform better than those of us who \nare charged with the responsibility of raising these awful amounts of \nmoney. So this is progress.\n  I want to emphasize what the Senator from Arizona did. It is only \nprogress in the context of a continued bipartisan effort. If either \nparty thinks they can gain political advantage by turning this into a \npartisan issue, all they will succeed in doing is killing this effort.\n  This effort can win. There is every sign that it will win and that \nthe President would be willing to sign it. With that caveat, with that \neffort to make sure that this is a continuation of the effort of \nbipartisanship, I welcome their support, and I look forward to further \nsupport from Members on both sides of the aisle.\n  I thank the Senator from Arizona and the Chair, and I yield the \nfloor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who seeks recognition?\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  \n[[Page S 16555]]\n\n  Mr. LUGAR.

Res. 191) designating the month of \n     November 1995 as ``National American Indian Heritage Month,'' \n     and for other purposes.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the immediate \nconsideration of the resolution?\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nresolution.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, on behalf of myself and the following 51 \nSenators, I am pleased to submit today a Senate resolution to designate \nthe month of November, 1995 as American Indian Heritage Month: Baucus, \nBennett, Bingaman, Bradley, Breaux, Brown, Bryan, Burns, Campbell, \nChafee, Cochran, Cohen, Conrad, Craig, D'Amato, Daschle, Dodd, \nDomenici, Dorgan, Exon, Faircloth, Feingold, Feinstein, Gorton, Graham, \nHatch, Inhofe, Inouye, Jeffords, Kassebaum, Kempthorne, Kennedy, J. \nKerry, Lautenberg, Levin, Lieberman, Mikulski, Moseley-Braun, Murray, \nNickles, Pell, Pressler, Reid, Sarbanes, Simon, Simpson, Specter, \nStevens, Thomas, Thurmond, and Wellstone.\n  Since 1982, the Congress has honored American Indians by designating \na special day or week to pay tribute to the many outstanding \ncontributions that American Indian tribes have made to our Nation. In \nthe past 5 years, the Senate and the House have jointly designated the \nmonth of November as a time to celebrate the unique culture and \nheritage of American Indian people.\n  Mr. President, there are 557 federally recognized Indian tribal \ngovernments in this country, each with their own distinct language, \nculture, and traditions. All of us as Americans reap the benefits from \nmany of these tribes' contributions, customs, and teachings.\n  Many of the principles of democracy that are reflected in the U.S. \nConstitution were drawn from the governmental traditions of various \nAmerican Indian tribes, particularly the fundamental principles of \nfreedom of speech and separation of powers in government. \nEnvironmentalists embrace the spiritual and practical teachings of \nIndian people because of their deep-rooted beliefs and reverence for \nthe natural world.\n  Many of our words in the English language derive from native \nlanguages, including those that denote rivers, cities and, counties \nnationwide. The beautiful art, crafts, and jewelry of American Indian \ntribes are a distinctive feature of our American heritage.\n  A wide range of modern medicines and remedies derive from traditional \nAmerican Indian healing practices that use natural herbs and plants. \nIndian people have lent important findings to the fields of \nagriculture, anthropology, astronomy, and other sciences.\n  In proportion to their share of the overall population, more American \nIndians have dedicated their lives to the military defense of our \ncountry than have any other group of Americans.\n  The special designation of November as American Indian Heritage Month \nis equally important as an educational tool for America's children. \nAmerican Indians and many others utilize this time to share their \nspecial cultural heritage with the larger world. Schools, educational \ninstitutions, and teachers take advantage of this opportunity to \ninclude educational activities and events in their curriculum and \nschool activities that celebrate the many contributions and \nachievements of American Indians. Federal agencies, various \norganizations, and private businesses plan activities geared toward \neducating the public and their employees about American Indian history \nand culture.\n  Mr. President, around the Thanksgiving holiday that occurs each \nNovember, Americans typically remember a special time in our history \nwhen the American Indians and English settlers celebrated and gave \nthanks for the bounty of their harvests and the promise of new \nkinships. I think the month of November is, therefore, an appropriate \ntime for America to commemorate and recognize the first Americans.\n  Therefore, I ask you to join me in this special tribute to the \nAmerican Indian people of this country. They deserve special \nrecognition for their significant contributions to our great Nation.\n  Mr. President, I urge immediate adoption of the resolution.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the resolution \nbe agreed to; that the preamble be agreed to; that the motion to \nreconsider be laid upon the table; and that any statements relating to \nthe resolution appear at the appropriate place in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  So the resolution (S. Res. 191) was agreed to.\n  The preamble was agreed to.\n  The resolution, with its preamble, is as follows:\n\n                              S. Res. 191\n\n       Whereas American Indians were the original inhabitants of \n     the land that now constitutes the United States of America;\n       Whereas American Indian governments developed the \n     fundamental principles of freedom of speech and separation of \n     powers in government, and these principles form the \n     foundation of the United States Government today;\n       Whereas American Indian societies have exhibited a respect \n     for the finiteness of natural resources through deep respect \n     for the earth, and these values continue to be widely held \n     today;\n       Whereas American Indian people have served with valor in \n     all wars from the Revolutionary War to the conflict in the \n     Persian Gulf, often in a percentage well above the percentage \n     of American Indians in the population of the United States as \n     a whole;\n       Whereas American Indians have made distinct and important \n     contributions to America and the rest of the world in many \n     fields, including agriculture, medicine, music, language, and \n     art;\n       Whereas American Indians deserve to be recognized for their \n     individual contributions to American society as artists, \n     sculptors, musicians, authors, poets, artisans, scientists, \n     and scholars;\n       Whereas a resolution and proclamation as requested in this \n     resolution will encourage self-esteem, pride, and self-\n     awareness in American Indians of all ages; and\n       Whereas November is traditionally the month when American \n     Indians have harvested their crops and is generally a time of \n     celebration and giving thanks: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate designates November 1995 as \n     ``National American Indian Heritage Month'' and requests that \n     the President issue a proclamation calling on Federal, State, \n     and local governments, interested groups and organizations, \n     and the people of the United States to observe the month with \n     appropriate programs, ceremonies, and activities. \n\n[[Page S 16556]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.
