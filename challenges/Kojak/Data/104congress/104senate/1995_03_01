Mr. President, I rise today to express my support for \nHouse Concurrent Resolution 20, which would permit the use of the \nCapitol rotunda to commemorate the Days of Remembrance of Victims of \nthe Holocaust.\n  It has now been more than 50 years since Adolf Hitler mounted his \nsystematic effort to destroy the Jewish people. Today, many survivors \nof the Holocaust are aging or have died. Soon, they will no longer be \nable to share their first-hand accounts of Hitler's savagery.\n  Now more than ever, we must redouble our efforts to remember the \nterror of the Third Reich, and to teach our children important lessons \nabout the need for tolerance and the dangers of intimidation.\n  The Days of Remembrance is a week-long commemoration of the \nHolocaust. On April 27, an international day of commemoration, there \nwill be a ceremony on the Capitol rotunda consisting of speeches, \nreadings, and musical presentations, to honor and remember the 6 \nmillion innocent victims of the Holocaust. As a humane and tolerant \nsociety, we must stamp on our souls the haunting memories of these \nvictims: men and women, young and old, who were tortured and killed not \nbecause of something they did, but simply because of who they were.\n  Mr. President, we are all familiar with the adage that those who do \nnot learn from history are doomed to repeat it.\n  Our duty to those who died on the trains, in the fields and in the \ngas chambers, is to make sure that their story is told from generation \nto generation. We must study and reflect on the atrocities of the \nNazis, in order to make sure that this dark chapter of history is never \nrepeated.\n  It is a painful study, Mr. President, but it is the only way we can \nsanctify the memory of the victims and make sure that their suffering \nis never forgotten.\n  Mr. President, there is often a temptation to obscure the dark \npassages to humanity, but we know that we cannot be true to history \nunless we reveal them. The Days of Remembrance are a time for us to \nundergo this painful reflection and I laud my colleagues for passing \nthis important resolution.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the resolution \nbe agreed to, and the motion to reconsider the vote be laid upon the \ntable.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  The concurrent resolution (H. Con.

Mr. President, as the Congress begins to debate \nthe foreign aid budget this year, U.S. assistance and involvement in \nAfrica is once again in question.\n  It would be a grave mistake for the United States to disengage \ncompletely from Africa, particularly at this point. As the success \nstories of South Africa, Namibia, Mozambique, and other African nations \nin transition tell, there is potential for great gains in Africa--both \npolitically and economically. At the same time, even recent history \ndemonstrates that if we ignore Africa, conflicts and problems can \nexplode into political, economic, and humanitarian disasters for which \nwe all pay the price.\n  On this note, I commend to my colleagues an article which appeared in \nthe New York Times this weekend entitled, ``In Africa, West Can Pay Now \nor Later.'' It charts several reasons for international involvement in \nAfrica in the global context, and documents some reasons for U.S. \ninvestment in the continent.\n  Though some would like to write off Africa as irrelevant to U.S. \ninterests, it is impossible to argue that what happens in a continent \nof close to 1 billion people has no effect on us. An investment in \nAfrica of money, diplomacy, and attention today will help develop \npolitical stability, which in turn will yield economic benefits for \nAfricans and international trading partners: Together political and \neconomic developments will help reduce the number and level of \ntragedies we have witnessed in Africa.\n  Reducing the Federal deficit is in our national interest and should \nbe our top priority. But a wholesale abandonment of U.S. investment in \nregions of the world such as Africa is not in the U.S. interest. We \nneed to make sensible decisions about necessary U.S. investments. In \nthe long run, our populations, the environment, universal human rights, \nand international markets will benefit greatly from a relatively small \ninvestment today.\n  I ask that the text of the article be printed in the Record.\n  The article follows:\n                [From the New York Times, Feb. 26, 1995]\n\n                 In Africa, West Can Pay Now, Or Later\n\n                         (By Howard W. French)\n       Abidjan, Ivory Coast.--Having struggled across the Sahara, \n     250,000 starving Sudanese refugees assemble on the Moroccan \n     coast, hoping to cross the Straits of Gibraltar to Europe. As \n     an armada of camera crews film them, the refugee's leader \n     launches this challenge to European Union coastal guards who \n     would stop them: ``All we ask of you is, watch us die.''\n       The event is pure fiction, the final scene of a 1990 BBC \n     television drama. But development experts say it neatly \n     illustrates a stark choice looming for the industrialized \n     world: Pitch in more energetically to bring Africa into the \n     global economic fold, or wait and watch as the continent \n     decends into a quickening spiral of disaster.\n\n\n                        an exploding population\n\n       With its population due to double to about 1.2 billion in \n     less than 30 years, and expected to reach 2 billion by 2050, \n     an Africa is crisis could well become the desperate stage for \n     a mass emigration the likes of which have never been seen.\n       Despite such warnings, however, the West seems to have \n     grown only more indifferent to Africa's fortunes. Some \n     American congressmen have recently likened aid to the \n     continent to throwing money into a rathole; Britain has said \n     it will cut its contributions to Africa through the European \n     Union, and even France is grappling with ways to reduce \n     obligations to its former possessions.\n       In response, frustrated development experts and new \n     democratic leaders in Africa have argued that would be far \n     cheaper to help the continent out of its problems now than to \n     rescue it later.\n       To get a sense of scale, it helps to look at two examples \n     where extremely rapid population growth rates--well over 3 \n     percent a year--are expected by United Nations statisticians \n     between now and the year 2000. They are Nigeria, which in the \n     early 1990's had 116 million people and a gross national \n     product per capita of only $350, and Kenya, which had 25 \n     million people and produced just $340 per person.\n       Nevertheless, the experts on Africa recognize that in an \n     era of austerity at home, arguments about investing abroad \n     today to prevent crisis tomorrow have limited appeal. They \n     now argue that traditional aid grants are not necessarily the \n     answer. ``The most effective thing that could be done for \n     Africa right now doesn't involve new money, but systematic \n     debt relief,'' said Thomas Callaghy of the University of \n     Pennsylvania. ``You could write off all of Africa's debts \n     tomorrow, and it wouldn't affect international financial \n     markets.'' But then, ``When you look at what has just \n     happened in Mexico you realize just how hard a thing this is \n     to sell politically.''\n       If Africa's approaching peril is not enough to motivate the \n     West to act with greater generosity, many hope that old-\n     fashioned appeals to profit might. Whether it was spices or \n     gold or slaves or vast quantities of gems and minerals, the \n     continent has always been a rich, if risky, El Dorado for the \n     venturesome outsider.\n\n\n      Why do investors hesitate before Africa's new opportunities?\n\n       Following Ghana's independence, Kwame Nkrumah, its first \n     president and a pioneer of the continent's ultimately \n     disastrous fling with socialism, defined the historical \n     problem, noting the ``paradox'' that Africa's ``earth is \n     rich, yet the products that come from above and below the \n     soil continue to enrich, not Africans predominantly, but \n     groups and individuals who operate to Africa's \n     impoverishment.''\n       Now, throughout much of the continent, several years of \n     dramatic efforts to remove barriers to trade and investment, \n     trim bureaucracies and rejoin the global economy have mostly \n     swept away the legacy of three decades of Mr. Nkrumah's brand \n     of socialism. Ghana and Uganda are prominent examples, and \n     investment in South Africa can at last be viewed as an \n     investment in the continent as a whole.\n       Because of these changes, Africa's riches are again up for \n     grabs. But so far, the international business community has \n     largely disappointed the development experts. Mali, for \n     example, can't find a partner to help finance a new power \n     company, even though companies from the United States, \n     Australia and Canada rush to explore for gold and diamonds \n     and oil there. Their hope is for the kind of quick extraction \n     of wealth that led to the continent's early disenchantment \n     with capitalism.\n       If Africa still requires a more cooperative form of \n     economic involvement, development experts say, it is because \n     the years under socialism did little to alleviate deep social \n     problems that include an undereducated population whose needs \n     grow faster than weak governments can possibly cope with, \n     poor roads and communications, a lack of managerial \n     expertise, and most of all a shortage of capital.\n       So Africa is in a bind: major foreign private investment in \n     productive new industries is unlikely unless these problems \n     are solved first, but the only sources of help to fix them is \n     overseas.\n       ``People cling to the myth that if only these countries \n     would get their policies right, everything would be okay,'' \n     said James Gustave Speth, the administrator of the United \n     Nations Development Program. ``There is no reason to believe \n     that Africa can't make it, but right now this is a continent \n     that is bleeding and without substantial outside help, there \n     is no hope.''\n       In addition to cutting debt burden, economists say the West \n     should drop barriers to \n     [[Page S3307]] goods like textiles that are often entry level \n     transformation industries for developing countries. In this, \n     they say, there could be a payoff for the West as well.\n       ``Aid to Africa is not welfare,'' J. Brian Atwood, the \n     administrator of the United States Agency for International \n     Development, wrote recently in The International Herald \n     Tribune. ``Africa is today what Latin American and Asian \n     markets were a generation ago. It is the last great \n     developing market.'' But what many see as a sensible \n     management of long-term interests collides with political \n     expediency. ``Putting people on their feet is just good \n     business sense'' said Edward V. K. Jaycox, vice president of \n     the World Bank. ``But it is a question of old-fashioned \n     industrial structures in the north, where a lot of people are \n     engaged in activities that they are loath to give up.'' By \n     that he meant something very much like what Mr. Nkrumah used \n     to say: If the West really wants to see an Africa healthy for \n     investment, it should stop raiding the gold veins and diamond \n     mines and open not just its wallets but its markets as \n     well.\n     \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/03/01/senate-section/article/S3306-3", "month": "03", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "01", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3307]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                           ORDER OF BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, today I rise as a proud cosponsor of the \nconstitutional balanced budget amendment, and I urge its adoption. I \nhope that today, we will be able to enlist the support of the 67 \nSenators necessary to pass this balanced budget amendment.\n  The time has come to put an end to out of control Federal spending \nthat has taken money from the private sector--the very sector that \ncreates jobs and economic opportunity for all Americans.\n  The President's recent budget proposals for next year offer clear \nevidence of the lack of political will to make the hard choices when it \ncomes to cutting Government spending. I strongly disagree with \nPresident Clinton's decision not to fight for further deficit reduction \nthis year.\n  The American people are crying out for a smaller, more efficient \nGovernment. They are concerned about the trends that for too long has \nput the interests of big Government before the interests of our job-\ncreating private sector. They are irritated by the double standard that \nexists between how our families are required to balance their \ncheckbooks and how Government is allowed to continue spending despite \nits deficit accounts.\n  It's clear, Mr. President. The time has come to heed the will of the \npeople. It is our duty, not only to heed their will, but to act in \ntheir best interest. And this amendment is in their best interest.\n  The President's budget maintains deficits of $200 billion over the \nnext 5 years, and the deficits go up from there. His budget does not \ntake seriously the need for spending restraint--restraint that would \nput us on a path toward a balanced budget by the year 2002.\n  In fact, Bill Clinton proposes spending over $1.5 trillion in fiscal \nyear 1995 to over $1.9 trillion in the year 2000. In other words, the \nonly path that the president proposes is one that leads to higher \nGovernment spending and ever increasing deficits.\n  Mr. President, my decision to cosponsor this legislation was not made \nlightly. The U.S. Constitution is our Nation's most sacred document. \nDozens of countries have modeled their constitutions around the \nprinciples espoused in ours. Many of the emerging democracies around \nthe world\n recognize the profound simplicity and timelessness contained in that \nhallowed document.\n\n  Any amendments to the Constitution should be made with care, and with \ncareful consideration of the intended outcome.\n  I believe the outcome of a balanced budget for our Nation is one of \nthe most important steps we can take to ensure the economic \nopportunities for prosperity for our children and for our children's \nchildren.\n  As a nation--and as individuals--we are morally bound to pass \nopportunity and security to the next generation. This is what a \nbalanced budget amendment will help us do. As Thomas Paine has written, \nno government or group of people has the right to shackle succeeding \ngenerations with its obligations. A balanced budget amendment will help \nus prevent the shackling of future generations.\n  As chairman of the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee I have \noutlined a plan to reduce the Federal bureaucracy, eliminate out-dated \nand wasteful Government programs, and to strengthen Government's \nability to better serve the taxpayers.\n  In January I kicked off a series of hearings on ``Government Reform: \nBuilding a Structure for the 21st Century.'' It is my belief that as we \nmove into the 21st century, so should our Government. Innovative \ntechnologies should allow us to cut out many layers of management \nbureaucracy, and reduce Federal employment. Programmatic changes should \nalso occur.\n  Last month, I released a report that I asked the GAO to examine the \ncurrent structure of the Federal Government. The GAO examined all \nbudget and Government functions and missions. They did not conduct in-\ndepth analysis, but simply illustrated the complex web and conflicting \nmissions under which agencies are currently operating.\n  The GAO report confirms that our Federal behemoth must be reformed to \nmeet the needs of all taxpayers for the 21st century. I am convinced \nthat it is through a smaller, smarter Government we will be able to \nserve Americans into the next century.\n  Deficit spending can not continue. We can no longer allow waste, \ninefficiency, and overbearing Government to consume the potential of \nAmerica's future. I am committed to spending restraint as we move to \nbalance the budget by the year 2002. And I ask my colleagues--and all \nAmericans--to support our efforts.\n  Mr. DASCHLE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the minority leader.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I would ask that I use part of the leader time accorded \nto me this morning to make a statement as if in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/03/01/senate-section/article/S3307-1", "month": "03", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "01", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3307-S3308]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             BALANCED BUDGET AMENDMENT TO THE CONSTITUTION\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, we have had 4 weeks of hard-fought and \nvery earnest debate. The issues are serious and the stakes are high. We \nare proposing to amend our Constitution for only the 28th time now in \nmore than two centuries. The debate has been vigorous. Virtually every \nSenator has spoken from virtually every perspective. Persuasive \narguments have been made by both Democratic and Republican Senators, \nand I respect the positions which my colleagues have adopted even in \nthose cases where I do not share their position. I recognize that each \nSenator has reached his or her position with thought and care and the \nbest of motives.\n  There is something upon which we all agree, and upon which we have \nagreed since the debate began; that is, the underlying need to reduce \nthe deficit and balance the budget. We need to put the budget on a \nglidepath to balance, and we are agreed that for the sake of working \nfamilies and the future economic strength of the Nation we must move \ntoward a balanced budget.\n  One thing we should all agree upon is that regardless of the outcome \nof the final vote, we will work together to develop a deficit-reduction \npackage that will put the budget on a glidepath to balance. I stand \nready to work with my colleagues on the other side of the aisle to \nachieve that goal.\n  Now, the question is how best to continue the effort that we have \nbegun throughout this decade, an effort begun in 1991 with a \nsignificant deficit reduction proposal, and again in 1993 with $600 \nbillion of additional deficit reduction. The question is can we achieve \nwhat we all say we want with the balanced budget proposal before us? \nThe question is how best to achieve a balanced budget using the methods \nthat we have available to us. And where we differ is whether the \namendment that is now pending reflects our best effort to amend the \nConstitution and achieve our goal of a balanced Federal budget.\n  Amending the Constitution is not a frivolous undertaking. We will not \nbe able to come back next year and fix our drafting mistakes. Many of \nus have concluded, regretfully, that this is not our best effort. In \nfact, in our view, our best efforts were rejected. To strengthen the \namendment, we offered amendments, but they were defeated essentially \nalong partisan lines, amendments that we felt ought to have been \nconsidered more carefully by our colleagues on the other side, \namendments like the right-to-know proposal which \n[[Page S3308]] laid out the blueprint that we all agree is necessary \nif, indeed, we are serious about reaching our goal in a short period of \ntime.\n  In a matter of 7 years, we proclaim today, if we pass this amendment, \nwe will have a balanced Federal budget.\n But we all recognize privately that, unless we have a blueprint, we \nsimply cannot achieve that goal in any meaningful way without using \nsmoke and mirrors, without a blueprint.\n\n  The American people have stated very clearly their desire to see a \nblueprint, and indeed that is what we tried to offer as we considered \nthis amendment many weeks ago. Some of us suggested that we provide for \na capital budget so the Federal budget would work like the budgets of \nvirtually every business, every State, every family in this country. We \nwanted to preserve the ability to respond to national security or \neconomic emergencies, something that we have attempted to address in \namendments as well. We tried to protect against unconstitutional \nPresidential impoundments and preserve the integrity of Congress' power \nof the purse. We tried to protect veterans' health programs and \npensions.\n  Finally, we tried to protect Social Security, to make certain that \nall those commitments we made verbally on the Senate floor and in the \nmedia about protecting Social Security would in fact be kept when the \namendment became part of the U.S. Constitution. On Social Security \nalone we had a number of different votes, different ways to make \ncertain that the solemn commitment to protect the money in the trust \nfund would not be broken by a future Congress. We ran into a stone wall \nand, as a result, Social Security, despite Republican claims to the \ncontrary, is legally and realistically available for cuts. We know \nthat. And the Social Security trust funds are completely vulnerable to \nbeing raided.\n  Those who support the idea of a balanced budget amendment worked to \nimprove this proposal so that it would be balanced and that we could in \nconscience vote for it without relying upon those trust funds for the \nnext 7 years. But those efforts, too, were rejected.\n  We are still committed to balancing the budget. As supporters of this \nproposal have told television reporters outside the Senate Chamber, \npassage in this Chamber will not bring the budget one penny closer to \nreal balance. Only we can do that. There is no machine that ultimately \nis incorporated in this Constitution that will force us to do what we \nare unable to do today. That is up to us. It is important that we \nunderstand that. It is we who must take that responsibility and no one \nelse.\n  Some will attempt to characterize a vote against this flawed \namendment as a vote against balancing the budget, but that is not what \nthis vote is about. As I said, we all agree on the importance of \nbalancing the budget. But this amendment simply does not do the job.\n  For the past month the Republican majority has been trying to pass \ntheir balanced budget amendment and claim a political victory. They \nhave refused to listen to those of us who support an amendment but have \nhad concerns about the language, rejecting our proposals time after \ntime after time. They have refused to listen to the people of this \ncountry who have a right to know about how we are going to balance the \nbudget. And, most important, they have refused to join us as we insist \non real protection for Social Security, putting their political \ncontract ahead of a solemn contract with the American people.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DOLE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the majority leader.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, leaders' time was reserved?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Yes.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/03/01/senate-section/article/S3307-2", "month": "03", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "01", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3308-S3309]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     THE BALANCED BUDGET AMENDMENT\n\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I will make a motion here in a moment to \nhave the Senate stand in recess subject to the call of the Chair.\n  I would also indicate, though I did not raise the question last night \nabout rule XIX, I think my colleague from West Virginia came close if \nnot being in violation of rule XIX, which states: ``No Senator in \ndebate shall directly or indirectly, by any form of words impute to \nanother Senator or to other Senators any conduct remotely unworthy or \nunbecoming a Senator.'' I would ask that--some of the ``tawdry'' \nreferences, ``sleazy'' references, in my view were uncalled for.\n  This is a very important vote. I believe there are 66 votes for the \namendment, Democrats and Republicans. We need 67. Or we need 66, if \nthere are only 99 voting.\n  I thought a lot about what procedure to follow after we recessed last \nevening. I thought about the hard work of the Senator from Utah, \nSenator Hatch; the Senator from Illinois, Senator Simon; and other \nDemocrats and Republicans who have worked and worked and worked for \nmonths and months and weeks and weeks and days and days and hours and \nhours in an effort to gain the support of 67 of our colleagues.\n  This must be bipartisan; there are only 53 Republicans. As I said \nlast night, if you want to take a look at total nonpartisanship, take a \nlook at Senator Simon. He is leaving the Senate. He can do most \nanything. If he had any political motives, I assume--you can say, in \nmost cases, Members have political motives--but in this case you \ncannot. He feels strongly about the amendment. We feel strongly about \nprotecting Social Security. We have made a number of suggestions to \nMembers on the other side about protecting Social Security, but it is \nnever quite enough, never quite enough, never quite enough.\n  I must say, it seems to me to be in the interest--not in our \ninterest--in the interest of the American people; 76 to 80 percent of \nthe American people support the balanced budget amendment. And they \ncould care less whether we voted last night or vote today or tomorrow \nor next week or the next week. They know the country is in danger of \neconomic collapse unless we do something.\n  The American people are very sophisticated. They listen to radio. \nThey read the newspapers. They watch television. They watch C-SPAN. \nThis is no time for retreat. This is a time, as far as this Senator is \nconcerned, for all of us who believe in the balanced budget amendment \non both sides of the aisle to try to find one more vote--not in some \nback room deal, as alleged last night by the Senator from West \nVirginia--but by a recognition that if we do nothing--it probably will \nnot make any difference to us or our families, but what about the 80 \npercent of the American people out there who want us to balance the \nbudget? They balance their budgets. They balance their budgets in their \nbusinesses and in their homes, and they do not understand this \nbusiness-as-usual attitude in Washington.\n  We are going to continue to try to find one vote. If we fail on that, \nthen I, when the vote is cast, if it ends up 66, I will change my vote \nand I will enter a motion to reconsider. That motion to reconsider is \nnot debatable. It can be called up any time by the leader, and I think \nsometime about next September might be appropriate to reconsider this \nwhole issue. We do not want to do it too quickly, but maybe let it--\nleave it out there a year. Let us see what happens as we get nearer the \nelection and the American people are a little agitated at Congress, as \nthey should be.\n  I just suggest if anyone in this Chamber on either side of the aisle \ncan find one more vote--or send someone on vacation, who might be on \nthe other side--we need your help. The American people need your help. \nThis is not a battle--this is a victory--victory for whom? Not for Bob \nDole. Not for Paul Simon. Not for Larry Craig. Not for Orrin Hatch. Not \nfor Jim Exon. This will be a victory for the people. That is what this \nis all about. Give America back to the people.\n  Dust off the 10th amendment. Unless the power is reserved to the \nFederal Government, give it back to the States and give it back to the \npeople.\n  We are going to continue every way we can to make this happen.\n  Mr. President, I move the Senate stand in recess subject to the call \nof the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I object.\n  [[Page S3309]] The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the \nminority leader.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I only object so as to respond, if I \ncould, using the remainder of my leader time. How much time do I have \navailable?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 3 minutes.\n  Mr. DOLE. That is all right. Whatever you need.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President let me respond to the distinguished \nminority leader. I do not know that I have learned all the rules of \nthis place as well as he has, but I thought that a deal was a deal.\n  I thought in good faith that when we negotiated an agreement which \nrequired unanimous consent that a deal was a deal and that our word was \nour bond. The word that I was given over a week ago was that we would \nhave a vote last night. The vote was not going to be if we had so many \nvotes we keep the deal. The vote was we are going to keep our deal. We \nwill have a vote, and that will be the end of it.\n  I recognize the right of any Senator to change his vote and make a \nmotion to reconsider. That is always within the prerogative of any \nSenator. And the majority leader is certainly within his rights to do \nthat. But to say today that we are going to change the rules and that \nwe are going to nullify an agreement that we had in good faith last \nweek makes me wonder whether or not we will ever get another agreement \nduring this Congress. It makes me wonder whether in good faith we can \nnegotiate and come to some arrangement with regard to the consideration \nof any bill in the future.\n  So this portends some very serious ramifications, and I hope that we \nall recognize it. I thought we had a deal. I thought we had an \nagreement. I thought we were going to go to a vote. If we are not going \nto go to a vote, if we are going to delay that vote and bring it up \nsome other time, I think it is imperative that we have the notice of \nthe majority leader in advance so all Members can be forewarned.\n  But I must say that I am deeply disappointed and that this kind of \ninstant rulemaking is unacceptable.\n  I yield the floor and reserve my right to consider the proposal by \nthe majority leader again.\n  Mr. DOLE. I thank the Senator from South Dakota.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/03/01/senate-section/article/S3308-1", "month": "03", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "01", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3309]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         RECESS UNTIL TOMORROW\n\n  Mr. DOLE.
